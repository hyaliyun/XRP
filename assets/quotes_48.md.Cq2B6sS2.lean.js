Early life, education and employment Shamim Karhani () was born in a 'Zamindar' family to Syed Muhammad Akhtar and Ummat ul Zehra on 8 June 1913 in village 'Karhan' district Mau, UP in India. His real name was 'Syed Shamsuddin Haider'. He himself chose 'Shamim Karhani' as his pen name ('Takhallus'). Later, this pen name of his became so famous that once, at an interview, when he was asked his name, he himself had to pause for a moment to remember his real name! He did his secondary education from Aligarh Muslim University and also did 'Maulvi Kamil Munshi'. For his profession, he chose to be a teacher.Ali Anjum, Syed Khwaja: Shamim Karhani: Hayaat, Shaksiyat aur Shayari, Syed Sikandar Ali & co., 1986. He worked with Dayanand Anglo-Vedic Schools System, Kaumi Awaz and Anglo Arabic School (New Delhi). He was a scholar of the Persian language; however he did all his poetry in Urdu. Poetry and India's freedom struggle Shamim had a taste in poetry since he was a kid. He composed his first couplet at the age of eight. He now was aware what he was born for. He started writing and was adored all over Uttar Pradesh. This was the era when India was vehemently trying to get out of snare of British rule. Being an Indian he started writing poems that conveyed the moral of adhesion to one's own country. These poems became so influential that his popular revolutionary 'Nazms' and 'Naghmas' ('Geets') were sung in the 'Prabhat-Pheris' taken out on the streets of cities like Lucknow and Varanasi during the freedom struggle. Letter from Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime minister of India, to Shamim Karhani. It reads:A poet should make his life itself a poem. Shamim Karhani has sung of India's freedom. I hope he will continue to do so and enjoy this freedom Soon Shamim Karhani's nationalist and revolutionary poetry started attracting the attention of both the common people and the literati. It was through this nationalist platform that he joined the Progressive Writers' Movement. In 1948 he composed a poem entitled Jagao Na Bapu Ko Neend Aa Gayi Hai just after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. The above poem had such an emotional appeal that it spread like the jungle fire. Once, Shamim Karhani had the opportunity to recite the poem in the presence of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India. Nehru, after listening to the poem, got impressed by Shamim's work and asked him to come to Lucknow to recite his poems in Congress election meetings. Later, after independence, Nehru asked Shamim to come to Delhi. He migrated to Delhi in 1950 and met Nehru at 'Teen-Murti'. Nehru asked him to compose an epic in Urdu on the freedom movement of India and started giving him a stipend for the job from his personal pocket. On 7 February 1950 he wrote in Shamim's diary: His collection entitled \\"Roshan Andhera\\" was entirely devoted to the \\"Quit India Movement\\".Gujral, I.K.: P.I.B.

After the successful Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire, the assassination of Francisco Pizarro in 1541, and the execution of his main antagonist, Diego de Almagro (1538) and his son, El Mozo (1542), most of the competent commanders of the recently founded New Castile Governorate had been lost in the ensuing power struggle. In 1540, second in line of the Pizarro brothers, Hernando Pizarro, returned to Spain to defend the question of his and his brothers' reign in Peru against accusations of abuse of power. He was eventually imprisoned on orders of King Charles. The Almagristas, followers of Diego de Almagro, met their downfall in the battle of Chupas on September 16, 1542. Two years later, King Charles eventually sent his own envoy, Blasco N√∫√±ez Vela, as governor over the recently found Viceroyalty of Peru, and as well to ensure the accomplishment of the New Laws enacted in 1542 to protect the native Peruvian population of Peru. Gonzalo Pizarro, however, refused to relinquish power and the sovereignty over Peru once belonging to him and his brothers. With his namesake as an ensuring symbol of the former reign of the Pizarros, he gathered supporters, mainly opposed by formal governor of New Castile, Crist√≥bal Vaca de Castro, victor at Chupas over the Almagristas. The Viceroy arrived at Lima, new capital of Peru, and was sworn into office on May 17, 1544. He shortly after had Castro imprisoned and sent home to Spain. On September 18, Gonzalo Pizarro managed to depose Blasco N√∫√±ez Vela and sent him as prisoner to Panama. On October 28, the 1,200 men strong army of Gonzalo Pizarro entered Lima. Upon arrival to Panama, however, Vela was released, and returned to Peru with royal claims as the rightful viceroy and governor of Peru, landing in Tumbes. The two gathered supporters and met on January 18, 1546 at A√±aquito in present-day Ecuador, superiority in numbers and firepower ensured victory for Gonzalo Pizarro, who crushed the army of Blasco N√∫√±ez Vela, who was decapitated on the field of battle. This, in its turn, ensured a struggle for the control of Peru between Gonzalo Pizarro and the royal forces. The king then appointed Pedro de la Gasca as new governor of Peru; meanwhile, the land itself fell under control by Gonzalo Pizarro and his forces. De la Gasca landed in Peru in 1547, winning supporters to his initially inferior forces by promising amnesty to those having committed treason to the crown, and proclaimed he would not enforce the New Laws, whose dispositions demanding better conditions for native laborers had led many powerful encomenderos to join Pizarro's cause. After initial skirmishes, the two forces went close to a confrontation in late 1547 at Jaquijahuana (Xaquixaguana, Sacsahuana) plains near Cuzco, but de la Gasca succeeded in avoiding battle, gaining precious time which he employed to convince even more of Pizarro's officers to switch sides, among them the notorious Alonso de Alvarado. Although Pizarro had arrived to Jaquijahuana with a vastly superior force, by the time the two sides finally met on the battlefield in April 1548, the situation had reversed, a steady string of defections having left Pizarro's forces in grave numerical inferiority and poor morale. The battle itself proved to be a disaster for Gonzalo Pizarro, with all his men who hadn't already defected being killed or captured on the field, while de la Gasca's men reportedly suffered a single casualty. Gonzalo himself, along with his most loyal commander, Francisco de Carvajal, dubbed the Deamon of the Andes, were captured on field of battle and executed by beheading. De la Gasca then made efforts to consolidate his control over Peru, which remained a royal colony and viceroyalty until the revolutionary actions of Jos√© de San Mart√≠n and Sim√≥n Bol√≠var during the early 19th century.

Although Foster Kennedy syndrome is sometimes called \\"Kennedy syndrome\\", it should not be confused with Kennedy disease, or spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, which is named after William R. Kennedy. Pseudo- Foster Kennedy syndrome is defined as one-sided optic atrophy with papilledema in the other eye but with the absence of a mass. Presentation The syndrome is defined as the following changes: * optic atrophy in the ipsilateral eye * disc edema in the contralateral eye * central scotoma (loss of vision in the middle of the visual fields) in the ipsilateral eye * anosmia (loss of smell) ipsilaterally This syndrome is due to optic nerve compression, olfactory nerve compression, and increased intracranial pressure (ICP) secondary to a mass (such as meningioma or plasmacytoma, usually an olfactory groove meningioma). There are other symptoms present in some cases such as nausea and vomiting, memory loss and emotional lability (i.e., frontal lobe signs). Diagnosis Brain tumor can be visualized very well on CT scan, but MRI gives better detail and is the preferred study. Clinical localization of brain tumors may be possible by virtue of specific neurologic deficits or symptom patterns. Tumor at the base of the frontal lobe produces inappropriate behavior, optic nerve atrophy on the side of the tumor, papilledema on the other side, and anosmia. Kaplan USMLE step 2 CK Lecture Notes 2018, Surgery Treatment  The treatment, and therefore prognosis, varies depending upon the underlying tumour. While awaiting surgical removal, treat any increased intracranial pressure with high-dose steroids (i.e., dexamethasone). History The syndrome was first extensively noted by Robert Foster Kennedy in 1911, an Irish neurologist, who spent most of his career working in the United States of America. However, the first mention of the syndrome came from a William Gowers in 1893. Schultz‚ÄìZehden described the symptoms again in 1905. A later description was written by Wilhelm Uhthoff in 1915.

Use An American rotary lawnmower mechanic (b. 1927) when queried as to the first rotary mower he knew of - produced a picture of a machine mass produced around 1939 which originally used a Ford Model A or B electric starter motor turned vertically with a steel disc attached to the output shaft having common sickle bar trapezoidal blades riveted upon it. Power originally came from a 6v lead acid battery likewise sourced from a Ford automobile. The machine was pictured in a color photograph dating from about 1964 and had been fitted with a Maytag 2-cycle gasoline engine having its float carburetor on an adapter block turned to permit operation with the crankshaft protruding downward for \\"vertical crankshaft\\" operation as is common now. It had only two steel spoked wheels on a single axle and an adjustable tail skid that caused a limited range of cutting heights to be available. In agriculture, a rotary mower is a piece of machinery that is often pulled behind a tractor and powered by the power take- off; it uses thick blades of sharpened metal to cut thick grass, heavy bushes, weeds and even small trees. Due to the high torque and power associated with the implement, shields made of hanging heavy chain or thick vinyl or rubber are often provided around the discharge chute to control flying debris. French agricultural machinery manufacturer Rousseau SA claims to have invented the mechanical rotary mower in 1962.\\"History\\" at rousseau-web.com In horticulture, a rotary mower is usually an integral machine that is either pushed by hand or driven by a riding operator, and used to cut amenity and sports turf.

Plot Daichi Shinagawa was just a Yankee (Japanese term for delinquent) who wanted nothing to do with his high school life. Hana Adachi, the dedicated class representative, however would not allow it and constantly bothers him to be involved in school life. Shinagawa is first confused on why she keeps pestering him until he discovers her secret. While she may look like a typical class representative stereotype, Adachi is actually not very smart and lacks common sense, and Shinagawa eventually learns that Adachi is a former delinquent. Regretting being a yankee during her middle school years, Adachi decides to change her ways to achieve her dream of becoming the best class representative. She decides to help Shinagawa so he will not continue to make the same mistake that she did. Thus begins the adventures of these two unlikely friends and their classmates at Mon Shiro High School. Characters Main characters ; : :Played by: Hiroki Narimiya, Amon Kabe (young) : The male protagonist of the story. Also known as \\"Yankee-kun,\\" Shinagawa is a short-tempered delinquent who does not like to be bothered and has no plans for his high school life. That is until he meets Adachi, a former delinquent who convinces him to change his path else he might regret it like she did, which he isn‚Äôt aware until seeing how his rivals get afraid when they know Hana. At first he is merely pestered by Adachi into becoming more active in school, but gradually changes throughout the series: from small things such as not smoking and avoiding class to even becoming the student council's co-vice president. He hates to study but is pretty good in math. He is also an honorable person who will try everything to protect others, becoming an integral member in his newfound group of friends. : His mother is a lawyer while his father, whose personality is similar to his, is a renowned doctor. Later in the series, it is revealed that he was one of the top students in a reputable private middle school. He was kicked out of the school after fighting the delinquents who were bothering his number one rival in studies, . Although he made a promise with Shizuku to meet again in university, his grades had already begun to slip, eventually losing interest in studies entirely and subsequently becoming a student with poor grades. This event marks his becoming a delinquent and his changed look (he previously had black hair and wore glasses). : He initially has a love-hate relationship with Hana Adachi, liking her due to her nature to help others no matter what, but becoming annoyed with her due to her idiocy, lack of common sense, and forcing him to help with her bizarre plans and antics. In a bonus chapter, it is shown that Shinagawa decided to attend Mon Shiro only after seeing a beautiful girl, who was actually Adachi without glasses and with loose hair (something he didn't realize until much later), at his entrance exam. Although he always bicker with Adachi, he would do anything so that he won't hurt or upset her. He later admits to liking her and even gets jealous when her former middle school classmate tells Shinagawa his intentions to ask her out, but Adachi remains oblivious to Shinagawa's feelings. :He gets accepted into a prestigious university and four years after their high school graduation, he is shown to be teaching at Mon Shiro. However, he is also found to live with Hana later, and thus making his friends to believe Hana is his housewife, something he and Hana deny. It is the time when he tries to keep Hana's identity, that he finds out she is the girl who was actually Adachi without glasses and with loose hair before. :In anime version of Miki Yoshikawa's other work, Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches episode 2 of the OVA and episodes 3 and 7, Daichi appears as cameos with voice provided by Y≈´ki Ono. He also appears in the crossover Yankee-kun na Yamada-kun to Megane-chan to Majo, but with the body-swap of Ryu Yamada. ; : :Played by: Riisa Naka :The female protagonist of the story. Adachi is the class representative and later, the student council president. Despite her appearance as the quiet and dutiful class rep, she lacks common sense and often has the worst grades in class. Having been a delinquent before attending high school (to the point that she was even held back a year), she initially does not know how to interact with normal students so she hangs around Shinagawa, forcing him to be more active in school. Since she desires to be a normal student, Adachi tries not to use her monstrous fighting abilities and had even changed her appearance; she ties her hair in pigtails and wears glasses despite having great eyesight. When she starts attending school without glasses and pigtails, her popularity among the student body skyrockets, but after mistakenly believing that Shinagawa's father took her for a delinquent, she goes back to wearing them. :Not much is known about her past besides her status as a fearsome delinquent during middle school, with the mention of her name striking fear in anyone who knows her reputation. She is even shown to have influence over Yakuza gangsters. Also, it is mentioned that she left her main residence in order to live with her grandma, who is itself not much different to Hana. However, after being accepted into a high profile university, she decides to go back home despite the consequences that might befall her. According to her grandma, she did this for Shinagawa's sake. She reappears to Shinagawa four years later as a transfer student in Mon Shiro since she officially dropped out of school before she could graduate. :She is later found to have lived with Daichi, and thus his friends mistake her as Daichi's housewife, which is denied by Daichi and herself. :She also makes an appearance in anime version of Miki Yoshikawa's other work, Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches episode 2 of the OVA. ; : :Played by: Yu Koyanagi : A tall, bespectacled, fearsome-looking student with a noticeable scar extending across his forehead and left eyebrow. His normal stare appears fearsome to most despite in reality he is a bit childish and cowardice, which had led to him becoming a hikikomori a week after he got into trouble with a gang. Adachi and Shinagawa beat the gang (without knowing they themselves were the cause of his self-isolation) which allows him to overcome his fears. Adachi tries to get him to attend school and take the exams, but he refuses, saying he is afraid of sitting next to Shinagawa, when in reality he is merely looking for Adachi's attention. Shinagawa tells him to attend school and take the exams or she will never visit him again. He is very smart, almost always scoring a 100 on a test, and becomes the student council's treasurer. He has a crush on Makoto which seems obvious to everyone around him except for Makoto. After the four-year time skip, the two are shown to be a couple. ; : :Played by: Haruna Kawaguchi : Adachi's kohai from middle school who transfers into Mon Shiro and becomes the student council's secretary. Known as \\"The Bloody Pantheress\\", she was a Yankee and Hana's right hand man back in middle school. She is still very devoted to Adachi, and has been ever since Adachi saved her and they became friends. While Adachi has reformed herself to become a good student, Himeji on the other hand still acts like a delinquent and initially believes that Chiba and Shinagawa are her subordinates. She has a bad relationship with her family because she is adopted, and when she told them that she wanted to transfer, they kicked her out of their home. She starts living with Adachi after the latter finds out about her situation. Though she is antagonistic towards Shinagawa at first, she eventually develops a crush for him. After the four-year time skip, she is shown to be learning her family's business, the famous Himeji Corporation. :Surprisingly, she's interested in and is good at household chores, always shown to be cleaning around the group. ; : :Played by: Kanata Hongo : Izumi is an honor student who runs against Adachi for the student council president position. Like Adachi, he is a former delinquent who changed himself in order to focus more on his studies, with his grades ranking second in the entire grade. He was known as a legendary fighter during his biker gang days so Izumi considers himself number one in fighting already. Though he is the first person in the manga shown to be capable of blocking Adachi's kick (using all his might), he still lost to her swiftly. He decides to become the vice president instead after losing to her in a fight. He shares his position with Shinagawa resulting in the two often fighting over who is the better vice president. He gets really hyped up over the smallest things and still loves to wear his old gang outfit. He's shown to be sensitive about his short height, being the shortest male of the group, only barely taller than the girls. Four years later, he is shown to be studying law.

Released October 29, 1955, the cartoon is directed by Friz Freleng. The voices are performed by Mel Blanc and June Foray. The cartoon was Warner Bros.' latest adaptation of the \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" children's story, with the Big Bad Wolf and Granny playing their respective roles, with Tweety and Sylvester taking appropriate sides. Unlike her previous appearances, the usually cheerful Granny here is a female caricature of Ralph Kramden (of television's The Honeymooners), complete with ill-temperedness and use of the catchphrase, \\"One of these days ... pow! Right in the kisser.\\" As such, \\"Red Riding Hoodwinked\\" marked one of the earliest parodies of The Honeymooners. In addition, Granny's appearance is updated: Although she appears as a sourpuss here, her physical attributes (such as a less-pronounced chin) would be used in future appearances. Also, Granny's old-fashioned ways would be de-emphasized. The wolf character would re-appear in \\"Hare-Less Wolf\\", albeit designed differently and given the name Charles M. Wolf. Plot The story begins much like the classic fairy tale, with Red Riding Hood off to see her grandmother, who lives in the woods. The present she plans to bring her grandmother is Tweety (in his cage). Sylvester sees Red's cargo and immediately begins going after her, his primary interest being Tweety. Red boards the bus, but Sylvester continues after her as it drives into the woods, the inattentive cat striking a road sign along the way. In the woods, the Big Bad Wolf ‚Äî rougher looking in appearance than in later shorts ‚Äî waits for Red to come by. A sign announces who Big Bad is, much to his disgust. Sylvester overhears the requisite exchange of Big Bad asking Red where she is headed and soon joins Big Bad in trying to reach Granny's house first. In fact both villains nearly beat each other up trying to be \\"Grandma\\" to catch their prey (\\"Tryin to muscle in on my racket?\\") Big Bad ousts Granny from the house, to which she immediately swears revenge (mimicking Ralph Kramden's signature \\"POW! Right in the kisser!\\" line). Big Bad and Sylvester hurriedly dress in Granny's clothing in anticipation of Red's arrival. Big Bad takes his place in the bed after shooing Sylvester underneath. Once Red arrives and presents \\"Grandma\\" with Tweety, she sets it down as asked; Sylvester immediately approaches the cage, prompting Tweety to ask: \\"Hewwo, Wittle Wed Widing Hood's Gwandma! Whatcha doin' under da bed?\\" After the signature exchange ending with \\"The better to see, smell, and eat you with,\\" and each character's realization of their sworn enemy (Red: \\"Oh! The Big Bad Wolf!\\" Tweety: \\"Eek! The Big Bad Puddy Tat!\\"), the chase begins. After several back-and-forth chases, with Big Bad and Sylvester getting the worse end of things, Red and Tweety flee Granny's home and head for the nearest bus stop. Their pursuers chase after the bus and immediately board at the next stop, only to be forcibly ejected and punched by the bus driver. That driver is none other than Granny, who then shouts, \\"I told them, one of these days...!\\" Red and Tweety supply the rest of the line: \\"Pow! Right/wight in the kisser!\\" The screen irises out.

Compare the various elements of the whole armor of God mentioned in the epistle to the Ephesians to Wisdom 5:17‚Äì20: Context Other related passages, by Paul and references by later theologians, indicate a metaphorical context for the Armor of God. For instance, Paul's letter to the Romans indicates not a literal, but a figurative, application of the concept (Romans , New International Version): In terms of the parts of the Armor of God, the various pieces (the belt of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, the shoes of the gospel of peace, the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit) are correlated to what Paul would have witnessed firsthand as the arms and armor of Roman legionaries during his life in the Roman Empire. Interpretations In biblical exegesis, the vast majority of biblical scholars, Catholic, Protestant, and otherwise, agree that Paul used the concept as a reference to spiritual battle with the Devil.\\"What is the Armor of God?\\" Website.

He is an Olympic bronze medalist, three-time World Championships silver medalist, and two-time European Champion. He has also been awarded the Honoured Master of Sports Ukraine title. Early life Vardanyan was born into a family of teachers. His mother taught Russian language and literature and his father was the director of a railway technical school. Vardanyan began wrestling in his hometown of Leninakan, Soviet Armenia (now Gyumri, Armenia). After the 1988 Armenian earthquake, he moved to Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine. He graduated from Zaporozhye National Technical University and was a soldier of the State Border Service of Ukraine. As of 1999 he lives in Kiev. Career Vardanyan became a Junior World Champion in 2000 in the Greco-Roman 66 kg class and began competing as a senior in the same division in 2003. He won silver medals at the 2003 European Wrestling Championships and 2003 World Wrestling Championships. The next year he became a European Champion by winning a gold medal at the 2004 European Wrestling Championships. He qualified for the 2004 Summer Olympics, but was unable to win a medal. In 2008 Vardanyan won a gold medal at the 2008 European Wrestling Championships. Vardanyan returned to the Olympics in 2008 in Beijing and upset the reigning Olympic Champion and Azeri flag bearer Farid Mansurov in his first match. He then lost to eventual silver medalist Kanatbek Begaliev in the quarterfinals, but rebounded with wins over Jake Deitchler and Nikolay Gergov in the repechage rounds to win a bronze medal. He won a second silver medal at the 2010 World Wrestling Championships and later tried to qualify for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but came in fourth place in the trials where only the top three wrestlers qualified. In October 2010 Vardanyan organized and hosted a Greco-Roman wrestling tournament in the youth age group. The tournament was attended by 90 children from Zaporizhzhia, who were divided into three age groups. In 2012 the tournament was held for a third time and involved 136 participants from Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk. That year, at the annual conference of the Association of Social Organizations, Vardanyan was named a coach of the Greco-Roman wrestling national team of the Union of Armenians of Ukraine. Politics In the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election Vardanyan ran for the Verkhovna Rada as a member of the party All-Ukrainian Union \\"Fatherland\\" for the District ‚Ññ 76. His revenue for the campaign was 120 thousand hryvnia. In addition to common purposes of the united opposition, Vardanyan pledged to create a network of sports facilities and clubs to satisfy the needs of the population. He failed to be elected, taking fourth place.

The first to describe this party model was Edmund Burke in 1770. More recently, the elite party model has been outlined by Maurice Duverger.Maurice Duverger, Party Politics and Pressure Groups: A Comparative Introduction, Robert Wagoner (trans.), Nelson, London, 1972. Elite parties form as groupings of elite members particularly in situations where an individual politician's political standing can be secured without the support of large populations. An elite party can form internally in the parliament and its political power is derived from that of its individual members. Elite parties have practically no extra-parliamentary structure and are generally more flexible than mass parties. The central role of independent, powerful individuals implies that their structure is often loose and that their policy may be internally disputed due to disagreements between individual members. As Duverger states, in elite parties \\"the members of Parliament play a key role\\".Duverger, p. 7. Also, Gunther and Diamond described that elite parties consists of parties of local notables or clientelistic parties based on notables. These are weakly organised and mobilize support through personal resources of the notables or through vertical patron-client networks. Elite parties are contrasted to mass parties that largely consist of \\"masses\\" of laymen. Mass parties can be democratic, such as decentralized liberal parties, or massive but centrally controlled like Nazi or Communist parties; these are occasionally classified separately. Elite parties, despite their origin in the elite, need not to be elitist and may represent any ideology. For example, there have been elite parties supporting ideologies as diverse and conflicting as classical liberalism, nationalism and aristocracy/elitism. A prominent example of a political system based on elite parties were the Hats and Caps parties in Sweden during the Age of Liberty (1719‚Äì1772).

Life  Born at Tours, Guillaume Bri√ßonnet was a younger son of Jean Bri√ßonnet, Lord of Varennes, in Touraine, Secretary to the king and collector-general of Customs. Appointed Superintendent of Finances for the Province of Languedoc under Louis XI of France, Guillaume Bri√ßonnet discharged the duties of his office with such integrity and efficiency, and showed himself so devoted to the interests of Louis that that monarch recommended him to his successor. Charles VIII of France made him Secretary of the Treasury, raised him to the first place in the Council of State, and, according to the historian Francesco Guicciardini, would undertake nothing in the government of his kingdom without the advice of Bri√ßonnet. Ludovico Sforza, called the Moor, wishing to dispossess his nephew of the Duchy of Milan, and finding himself opposed by Ferdinand I of Naples, sent an embassy under the Count of Belgiojoso to Charles to induce the king of France to assert his claims to the Kingdom of Naples as heir to the house of Anjou. Sforza promised to place all his troops at the king's service. Bri√ßonnet having shortly before this lost his wife, Raoulette de Beaune, by whom he had three sons, had entered the ecclesiastical state and been named Bishop of St.-Malo. To flatter his ambition the Milanese ambassadors assured him that the king's influence would raise him to the cardinalate. Bri√ßonnet, thus won over to the Sforza interest, adroitly encouraged the warlike dispositions of his sovereign, triumphed over the opposition of the royal council, of the Duke of Bourbon, and of Anne of France, the Duke's wife, influenced Charles to sign a secret treaty with Sforza, and assured the king of his ability to raise the funds necessary to carry on the war both on land and sea. Pope Alexander VI, alarmed at the apparent danger threatening Italy, promised the cardinal's hat to Bri√ßonnet if he could prevail upon Charles to abandon his enterprise; but Bri√ßonnet, realizing that he could not govern without flattering the king's passion for conquest, urged him on, and, notwithstanding the dilapidated state of the treasury, succeeded in meeting the expenses of the war. Accompanying Charles on his expedition, he provoked a mutiny in the French army, by his treachery in sacrificing the Pisans, allies of France, to their enemies, the Florentines, and had he not hidden himself from the fury of the soldiers they would have taken his life. Upon this occasion, as upon others, Bri√ßonnet's ambition led him into conduct at variance with his motto: Ditat servata fides. Charles had entered Rome as a conqueror, greatly irritated with Alexander VI for having stirred up opposition to him; but the adroit Bri√ßonnet reconciled his royal master with the pope, and for reward received the cardinal's hat. This honour was conferred in a special consistory held in the king's presence, 16 January 1495, the new cardinal taking the title of Cardinal of St.-Malo, from his episcopal see. Bri√ßonnet soon had cause to repent the advice he had given to invade Italy. A formidable league was formed for the purpose of cutting off the French retreat, and neither the diplomacy nor the entreaties of the French cardinal had any effect on the hostile generals. The prowess of Charles and the valour of his troops alone saved the French from defeat. With 8,000 men the king defeated, at Fornovo, an army of 40,000, and opened a road to France. Soon after this Bri√ßonnet, induced by a tempting promise of preferment for one of his sons, tried to persuade Charles to break off the peace negotiations and support with an army the Duke of Orleans' claims to the Duchy of Milan. Charles, however, preferred the counsels of Philippe de Comines and sacrificed the interests of the duke, and the king's premature death put an end to the influence of Bri√ßonnet, Louis XII giving his confidence to the Cardinal d'Amboise. While serving his king and the State, the Cardinal of St.-Malo had not overlooked his own interests; he had obtained from Alexander VI the Bishopric of Nimes. His title being disputed by the nominee of the chapter, there arose a litigation which lasted until the year 1507, when Bri√ßonnet was awarded the title. In 1497 he had received in commendam the Bishopric of Toulon, and in the same year succeeded his brother Robert Bri√ßonnet in the archiepiscopal See of Reims. On 27 May 1498, he crowned Louis XII in his cathedral and followed the king to Paris. As a peer of France, he assisted at the session of the Council of State at which the marriage of Louis with Jeanne, the daughter of Louis XI, was annulled. Effigy of Cardinal Bri√ßonnet at Narbonne When he had ceased to be a minister of State, Bri√ßonnet retired to Rome for two years. Louis then made use of his talents to check what he called the arrogance of the warrior pope, Julius II. By his king's direction Bri√ßonnet took steps to assemble at Pisa a council of cardinals opposed to the policy of Julius, and bent on the reformation of the head and hierarchy of the Church. He left Rome suddenly and secretly with a group of cardinals whom he had won over, and opened his council at Pisa, but soon transferred it to Milan, and thence to Lyon. He was, however, summoned to appear before the pope, was deprived of the Roman purple and excommunicated. Louis, on his side, bestowed upon him in commendam the rich Abbey of St.-Germain-des-Pr√©s and the government of Languedoc. At the death of Julius II Bri√ßonnet was absolved from all censures and excommunication in 1513, and restored by Pope Leo X to the Sacred College. He then retired to end his days at Narbonne, for which see he had exchanged Reims. He was buried in a superb mausoleum which he had built for himself in the church of Our Lady. Whilst in power, Bri√ßonnet showed himself a patron of men of letters; they dedicated their works to him and became his panegyrists. He was called oraculum regis and regni columna. His life was in fact swayed by ambition and occupied by intrigues. He composed a manual of Latin prayers, dedicated to Charles VIII. At Saint-Malo he issued several synodal instructions.

Bell was the first-round pick (7th overall) of the Chicago White Sox in the 1974 Major League Baseball Draft. Selected after just one season at Mt. San Antonio College, he was placed on the fast track to the majors, and was the youngest player in the major leagues when he debuted in 1976. On June 22 of that year, he hit a rare inside-the-park grand slam home run against Steve Busby of the Kansas City Royals, and he finished that season with a .248 batting average and 5 home runs in 230 at bats. Despite his young age, Bell never really developed beyond that. After two more years spent mostly in the minor leagues, he had a season very similar to '76 in 1979, when he batted .245 with 4 home runs in 200 at bats. In 1980, he regressed to a .178 average, and he was released by the White Sox after the season. Bell was picked up by the San Diego Padres, but before the 1981 season had even begun, he was shipped off to the Oakland Athletics along with two minor leaguers in exchange for pitcher Bob Lacey. One of those minor leaguers would turn out to be long-time A's star Tony Phillips. Bell himself fared less well, getting just 9 more at bats in the majors in 1982 before calling it a career.

I received ¬£300, a sum > unexampled in those days for so small a volume.\\"Piozzi 1861 p. 305 The Gentleman's Magazine of March 1786 said \\"On the third morning after the book was published not a copy of it could be obtained\\".Gentleman's Magazine March 1786, p. 244 The book went into four editions during 1786. Anecdotes Thrale began her work by stating in the Preface: > \\"I have somewhere heard or read, that the Preface before a book, like the > portico before a house, should be contrived, so as to catch, but not detain > the attention of those who desire admission to the family within, or leave > to look over the collection of pictures made by one whose opportunities of > obtaining them we know to have been not unfrequent. I wish not to keep my > readers long from such intimacy with the manners of Dr. Johnson, or such > knowledge of his sentiments as these pages can convey. To urge my distance > from England as an excuse for the book's being ill written, would be > ridiculous; it might indeed serve as a just reason for my having written it > at all; because, though others may print the same aphorisms and stories, I > cannot here be sure that they have done so.... I am aware that many will > say, I have not spoken highly enough of Dr. Johnson; but it will be > difficult for those who say so, to speak more highly. If I have described > his manners as they were, I have been careful to shew his superiority to the > common forms of common life.... When I have said, that he was more a man of > genius than of learning, I mean not to take from the one part of his > character that which I willingly give to the other. The erudition of Mr. > Johnson proved his genius; for he had not acquired it by long or profound > study.... But I must conclude my Preface, and begin my book, the first I > ever presented before the Public; from whose awful appearance in some > measure to defend and conceal myself.... Studious however to avoid > offending, and careful of that offence which can be taken without a cause, I > here not unwillingly submit my slight performance to the decision of that > glorious country, which I have the daily delight to hear applauded in > others, as eminently just, generous, and humane.Piozzi 1897 pp. 144-145 Critical response Horace Walpole quickly responded to the work in a letter 28 March 1786: > \\"Two days ago appeared Madame Piozzi's Anecdotes of Dr. Johnson. I am > lamentably disappointed - in her, I mean; not in him. I had conceived a > favourable opinion of her capacity. But this new book is wretched; a high- > varnished preface to a heap of rubbish, in a very vulgar style, and too void > of method even for such a farrago.\\"Walpole p. 46 On 30 April 1786 he followed with another: > \\"As she must have heard that the whole first impression was sold the first > day, no doubt she expects, on her landing to be received like the Governor > of Gibraltar, and to find the road strewed with branches of palm. She, and > Boswell, and their Hero are the joke of the public.\\"Walpole p. 49 Edmond Malone said, \\"On the whole the public is indebted to her for her lively, though very inaccurate and artful account of Dr. Johnson\\".Prior p. 364 James Clifford declared that the Anecdotes and the Thraliana \\"established her reputation as a bluestocking writer of the late eighteenth century\\".Clifford 1978 p. 10 Martine Brownley claims that the Anecdotes \\"have long pleased Johnsonians\\", but her \\"lasting literary fame is due to her diaries and letters\\".Brownley 1985 p. 635 Notes References * Balderston, Katharine C. \\"Introduction\\" in Thraliana: The Diary of Mrs Hester Lynch Thrale (Later Mrs. Piozzi) 1776-1809.

It is connected to the ramification in the field generated by the torsion points. Definition For an abelian variety A defined over a field F as above, with ring of integers R, consider the N√©ron model of A, which is a 'best possible' model of A defined over R. This model may be represented as a scheme over :Spec(R) (cf. spectrum of a ring) for which the generic fibre constructed by means of the morphism :Spec(F) -> Spec(R) gives back A. Let A0 denote the open subgroup scheme of the N√©ron model whose fibres are the connected components. For a maximal ideal P of R with residue field k, A0k is a group variety over k, hence an extension of an abelian variety by a linear group. This linear group is an extension of a torus by a unipotent group. Let uP be the dimension of the unipotent group and tP the dimension of the torus. The order of the conductor at P is : f_P = 2u_P + t_P + \\\\delta_P , \\\\, where \\\\delta_P\\\\in\\\\mathbb N is a measure of wild ramification. When F is a number field, the conductor ideal of A is given by : f= \\\\prod_P P^{f_P}. Properties * A has good reduction at P if and only if u_P=t_P=0 (which implies f_P=\\\\delta_P= 0). * A has semistable reduction if and only if u_P=0 (then again \\\\delta_P= 0). * If A acquires semistable reduction over a Galois extension of F of degree prime to p, the residue characteristic at P, then Œ¥P = 0. * If p> 2d+1, where d is the dimension of A, then \\\\delta_P=0. * If p\\\\le 2d+1 and F is a finite extension of \\\\mathbb{Q}_p of ramification degree e(F/\\\\mathbb{Q}_p), there is an upper bound expressed in terms of the function L_p(n), which is defined as follows: : Write n=\\\\sum_{k\\\\ge0}c_kp^k with 0\\\\le c_k and set L_p(n)=\\\\sum_{k\\\\ge0}kc_kp^k.

The SEED accounts are installed at birth with an initial deposit of $1,000, and accumulates over the span of a lifetime. All the money will be invested in children‚Äôs savings accounts for future purposes. Established in 2003, the SEED initiative accrues deposits from family, friends, and accountholders themselves, as well as augmented by other public and private sources. Each voluntary contribution from any public or private sector should be invented by a public match that increases in value over time for lower-income families. Requirements Any SEED account policy should encompass the following specifications: ‚Ä¢ Inclusive: Accounts should be established at birth for every child in America. ‚Ä¢ Seeded with an initial deposit: Every newborn should receive a modest but significant start-in-life deposit. ‚Ä¢ Configured to establish lifelong assets: Savings should be held until at least age 18 and should be used for only higher education/training, small business development, home purchase, or retirement. ‚Ä¢ Matched progressively: Voluntary additional contributions from any public or private source (e.g. family, friends, relatives, community organizations, and parents' employers) should be invented by a public match that increases in value for lower-income families. ‚Ä¢ Simplicity: Parameters of the account should be kept as simple as possible to enable low-cost, high- scale delivery (e.g. simple match rates, tax incentives, deposit structure, integration into tax forms). ‚Ä¢ Private-market oriented: Accounts should be held primarily in private financial institutions that provide limited investment options. ‚Ä¢ Savings should be used to build financial aspirations, knowledge, and skills: Age- appropriate financial education should be delivered by a variety of sources (e.g. financial institutions, nonprofit organizations, youth development organizations, schools, and families). ‚Ä¢ Non-discriminatory to welfare participants: Eligibility for means-tested programs should not be affected by savings in SEED accounts. Investment Results By initially investing $1,000 for a child at birth with a 6% rate of return will yield a resulted investment of $3,000 after 18 years. Additionally, adding $100 per year onto the base will accrue up to $5,000. By adding $50 a month to the slated $1,000 base will return more than $22,000. The financial sum of $3,000 - $22,000 can be seen as a financial catalyst to fueling a child‚Äôs college education. Typically, costs to attend a 2-year college are just below $2,000 a year and a 4-year public colleges are just under $4,000 a year.

He played professionally as an attacking midfielder for Swindon Town and Lincoln City. He is currently first team coach at Kempston Rovers. Career Early career Dykes began his career on the books of Tottenham Hotspur as a schoolboy until he was 15 before joining the youth set-up at Leyton Orient where he remained until he was 17. He moved into non-league football with Newport Pagnell Town before joining Buckingham Town in January 2001. League career A series of impressive performances for Buckingham saw Dykes attract the attention of scouts from the Football League and in July 2002 joined Swindon Town initially on trial before agreeing a one-year contract. He made his Swindon debut as a substitute in the 2‚Äì1 defeat to Wycombe Wanderers in the Football League Cup on 11 September 2002 and made a further two appearances in the Football League Trophy before joining Lincoln City on loan in December 2002. He was immediately inserted into the first team, making his Football League debut as a substitute in the 1‚Äì1 away draw with York City on 20 December 2002. After starting Lincoln's next two games, he was dropped to the bench and his loan deal was not renewed. Returning to Swindon, Dykes made two further league appearances before being released at the end of the season. Return to non-League football Following his release by Swindon, Dykes had an unsuccessful trial with Maltese side Marsaxlokk before returning to Buckingham Town. He would make only five appearances, two in the United Counties League and three in the FA Cup, in his return to the club before suffering a serious cruciate ligament injury in the 2‚Äì0 FA Cup victory over Ford Sports Daventry on 30 August 2003. The injury would keep him out of action for over two years. In November 2005 he made a return to the United Counties League, scoring on his debut for Stotfold in the 3‚Äì1 victory over St Ives Town on 22 November 2005. He joined Stony Stratford Town ahead of the 2006‚Äì2007 season. Playing in a more advanced role, he was a regular goalscorer for the club, netting a total of 22 goals in his first season, though only 10 of these came in the league. The following season saw him reach a total of 38 goals in all competitions, with 27 in the league. In June 2008 he moved up the non-league pyramid joining Rugby Town, debuting in the 2‚Äì0 away defeat to Bedford Town on 25 August 2008. Rugby's manager Rod Brown moved to Bromsgrove Rovers at the beginning of September 2008 with Tony Dobson appointed in his place. Dykes quickly moved on from Rugby Town, linking up with his one-time Buckingham Town manager Morell Maison at Halesowen Town. His spell at Rugby comprised a total of seven games, five in the league, and two goals, both of which came in the 5‚Äì3 FA Cup 1st Qualifying Round Replay home victory over Friar Lane & Epworth on 16 September 2008. However, he made only a single appearance for Halesowen before returning to Rugby where injury restricted his outtings and he temporarily linked up with former club Buckingham Town to gain fitness. He returned to Newport Pagnell Town at the start of the 2009‚Äì2010 season, scoring on his debut in the 1‚Äì1 home draw with Boston Town on 8 August 2009. In November 2013, he was appointed assistant manager to his erstwhile forward partner Darren Lynch at Newport Pagnell Town, a role he held until family commitments resulted in his resignation in September 2016. On 16 December 2016, he was announced as the new first team coach of Kempston Rovers. References External links Lincoln City F.C.

Rudolph was the second son of Sir Humphrey de Trafford, 3rd Baronet and Violet Alice Maud Franklin. He attended Downside (Sep 1907 to Jul 1911), and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was friends with Marshall Field III. After graduating with a BA in 1915, he fought in the First World War, being twice mentioned in despatches. In 1919, Rudolph joined Marshall Field in California for a vacation with Field's wife and children on Catalina Island. Career By 1931, Rudolph was working in London for the Boston investment bank Lee, Higginson & Co., which had also employed Marshall Field III. Although the bank collapsed in the Swedish match scandal in 1932, Rudolph continued to work for reformed company. In his capacity as the senior director in Europe of Higginson and Co, he negotiated at least two unsuccessful attempts at merger with the British investment house Kleinwort Benson in 1936 and 1938. Family Rudolph married June Isabel Chaplin, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Reginald Chaplin (son of John Worthy Chaplin VC), at St James's, Spanish Place on 6 February 1924. The reception was held at Seaford House, which was lent to the couple by Lord and Lady Howard de Walden and they honeymooned in Egypt. Their only son, Dermot, was born on 19 January 1925. In 1936, he and June had leased the Loder Dower House, at Cowfold, Sussex. Then in April 1938, after 14 years of marriage, June de Trafford petitioned for divorce on the grounds of Rudolph's adultery in a London Hotel in November 1937. The case was uncontested and the courts granted June a decree nisi along with custody of their son. In 1952, June remarried to Thomas Touchet-Jesson and became Lady Audley. They divorced in 1957 and June died in 1977. Rudolph also remarried, on the 2 February 1939 to Katherine 'Kay' Lo Savio Balke the daughter of W.W. Balke of Cincinnati, Ohio. He continued to work as a City of London banker, later being appointed director of the Royal Exchange. In 1971, when his elder brother Sir Humphrey de Trafford died with no male heirs, Rudolph succeeded him to the de Trafford baronetcy. Rudolph de Trafford died on 16 August 1983, two weeks before his 89th birthday, at his home in Eaton Square, London. His requiem mass was celebrated at St Mary's, Cadogan Street.

After the arrival of appointed royal viceroy Blasco N√∫√±ez Vela in 1544, Gonzalo succeeded to have him repelled and sent to Panama in chains. He was released, however, and returned to Peru by sea while Gonzalo was mustering an army. The two met on January 18 at I√±aquito in the outskirts of Quito, present-day capital of Ecuador, where the superiority of the Nueva Castilla army ensured victory for Gonzalo. Blasco N√∫√±ez Vela reportedly fought bravely but fell as a victim in battle and was later decapitated on the field of defeat, a fate Gonzalo himself would share two years later at Jaquijahuana. Background In 1542, The position Viceroy of Peru and the Royal Audience of Lima were created, and the next year Viceroy Blasco N√∫√±ez Vela and the new judges of the Royal Audience arrived at Peru. The said viceroy arrived with the strong intention of enforcing the recently enacted New Laws that abolished the encomienda prohibited the personal labor of the indigenous people. The encomenderos (the masters) protested and organized a rebellion, choosing Gonzalo Pizarro as leader, who was then a wealthy encomendero in Charcas (present-day Bolivia) Gonzalo went to Cuzco, where he was magnificently received and proclaimed Attorney General of Peru to protest the New Laws before the Viceroy and, if necessary, before the Emperor Charles V himself (1544). In Lima, the viceroy N√∫√±ez Vela was hated for his capriciousness, even to the extreme of killing a prominent resident of the city, an administrator by the name of Ill√°n Su√°rez de Carbajal, with his own hands. The judges of the Royal Audience, in their eagerness to gain popularity, were inclined to defend the rights of the encomenderos and take the Viceroy prisoner. On September 18, 1544, they sent him back to Spain. Gonzalo Pizarro triumphantly entered Lima on October 28, 1544, followed by 1200 soldiers. The judges, somewhere between joyous and fearful, received him as Governor of Peru. The rebellion against the Spanish crown was already a fact. The leader enjoyed popular support; his men called him the Great Gonzalo, and the uprising with the \\"Great Rebellion\\". Meanwhile, the Viceroy managed to escape, by convincing his keeper, the judge Juan √Ålvarez, to set him free. He landed at Tumbes, on the northern coast of Peru, and headed to Quito, where he formed a new army. With these forces he marched south, to confront Gonzalo's rebels. Preliminary Movements The Viceroy occupied San Miguel de Piura and continued south. Aware of these movements, Gonzalo left Lima with his forces and went north, arriving at Trujillo. The viceroy retreated then, fearing the power of his adversary, and returned to Quito at a forced march. The journey was long and tiring, all the while being closely pursued by Gonzalo, without fighting or fighting very little. Later they went further north, towards Popay√°n (present-day Colombia). Meanwhile, Captain Diego Centeno revolted in Charcas (Bolivia), raising the flag of the King. From Quito, Gonzalo Pizarro ordered Francisco de Carvajal to tackle this new campaign front, while Gonzalo was awaiting the viceroy. In the meantime, the viceroy remained concentrated in Popay√°n, where he received reinforcements from the north; one of the captains who joined with him was Sebasti√°n de Benalc√°zar, the governor of Popay√°n. While he was winning the support of the native chiefs in the region, whose work was invaluable, as they left the followers of Pizarro, thus increasing the impatience that Pizarro's men were suffering due to the prolonged inactivity. There was only one skirmish at a place called R√≠o Caliente. It was then that Pizarro planned an intelligent strategy to draw the viceroy out of Popay√°n, a position that he was finding difficult to attack: leaving a small garrison in Quito, under the command of Pedro de Puelles, Pizarro appeared to march south with his entire army, instructing their indigenous allies to spread the story that he was marching to aid Carvajal against Centeno. The viceroy was deceived and soon after moved his troops out of Popay√°n with the intent to seize Quito. He did not expect that the rebel leader instead of going south had stationed his men three leagues from Quito, along the river Guallabamba. The spies didn't catch the ruse until they reached Otavalo. Since it was too late to head back, so the viceroy withheld this news from his troops, so as not to discourage them, and continued to advance, already deciding to go to battle. Thus he came to the bank of the Guallabamba that faced the position of the rebels. It was too advantageous, the reason being that Benalc√°zar had advised the viceroy to divert to Quito by a less-traveled road, a plan which the viceroy accepted. Sad was the reception given to the viceroy in Quito, where there were women who, knowing the military superiority of Gonzalo, reproached the viceroy for having \\"gone there only to die.\\" The superior of the Franciscans, who was also pessimistic, offered refuge for Blasco N√∫√±ez in his convent and invited Benalc√°zar to retire as soon as possible, propositions which were ignored. Meanwhile, Pizarro's troops had also taken the road to Quito. The viceroy, considering the difficulties of mounting a defense in the city, rallied his troops and gave orders to leave and do battle outside of Quito. This was the evening of January 18, 1546. The Armies The Valley of I√±aquito is about 4 km long and it adorns a lagoon on whose shores colorful birds frolic. At a height that slightly dominates the Valley, Gonzalo Pizarro rallied his troops. He had about 700 men; of these 200 carried muskets and 150 rode horses. His Maestre de Campo, in the absence of Francisco de Carvajal, was Pedro de Puelles. One the leaders of the cavalry was Benito Su√°rez de Carbajal. They were accompanied by the judge V√°squez de Cepeda. Pizarro gave a fiery speech, whose final phrases were: \\"Gentlemen, to fight a defend your freedom, life and property.\\" Viceroy Blasco N√∫√±ez Vela's forces made up just over 400 men. His cavalry was almost the same in number as his adversary (some 140 men). Juan Cabrera was his Maestre de Campo, and for the captains of the musketeers and the pikeman: Sancho S√°nchez D√°vila, Francisco Hern√°ndez Gir√≥n, Pedro de Heredia y Rodrigo N√∫√±ez de Bonilla. The cavalry was divided into two squadrons: the viceroy took command of the major part, and the other he gave command to his captains Sebasti√°n de Benalc√°zar, Pedro de Baz√°n y Hernando de Cepeda (Cepeda was the cousin of Santa Teresa de Jes√∫sThe brothers of this saint fought in I√±aquito on the royal side: Lorenzo de Cepeda, Antonio de Ahumada (who fell in the battle), Jer√≥nimo de Cepeda and Hernando de Ahumada (as Lieutenant General). Another brother, Agust√≠n de Ahumada, would come to Peru later, accompanying the Peacemaker Pedro de la Gasca. The godfather of Santa Teresa de Jes√∫s was D. Francisco Vel√°squez N√∫√±ez Vela, brother of the Viceroy. It is understood that there was a profound relationship between the two families.). Among them, intending to fight as a soldier, was the judge Juan √Ålvarez. The Viceroy also delivered a moving speech, promising to be the first to break his spear against the enemy and finished with the dramatic words: \\"That God is the cause, God is the cause, God is the cause.\\" The viceroy also wore an uncu, an indigenous cotton shirt, that covered his armor and his badges. Some said that this was to avoid enemy fire, and others said that it was to fight with more humility, as one of the soldiers. The battle The battle began with musket fire from the viceroy's side, which the rebels immediately responded to. As promised, the viceroy led his riders in an attack against Puelles; and so great was their momentum that the first spear knocked down a rider by the name of Alonso de Montalvo. The clash of both cavalries, almost equal in numbers, was violent. But Pizarro's musketeers came to tip the scales of the fight. When they arrived at one flank, they began to decimate their enemies with deadly accuracy. The combat between the infantries favored Pizarro's side, being superior in number. Benalc√°zar was wounded by several shots, while Juan de Guevara and S√°nchez D√°vila were both killed. With their leaders dead, the viceroy's infantry crumbled. The victorious rebel cavalry destroyed the enemy without compassion, while the musketeers did not cease fire. The viceroy, who valiantly fought in the left flank, was finally reached by a blow from Hernando de Torres (a resident of Arequipa), receiving a mortal wound in the head. At first, they did not identify him due to the indigenous uncu over his armor. However, a little while later he was recognized by a soldier and the news reached Benito Su√°rez de Carbajal, whose brother Ill√°n had been murdered in Lima by the viceroy. For this reason Carbajal joined the battle, to kill the viceroy with his own hands and avenge the death of his brother. But he was held back by Pedro de Puelles, telling him that it was a rather base thing to go and kill a man who had already fallen. So Benito Su√°rez sent a black slave to finish the job. The viceroy was beheaded with a single blow, and the head was nailed and raised on a pike for all to see. Not content with this, Benito Su√°rez had the beard and mustache cut off, and used them to adorn his own hat; others imitated him, such as Juan de la Torre (called \\"The man from Madrid\\" to distinguish him from another man by the same name, one of the Famous Thirteen). The death of the viceroy demoralized the last of his infantry that were still resisting, who were captured and slaughtered. Only a few were able to escape. They were followed for a while by Pizarro's riders, until night fell and Gonzalo sounded the trumpets, gathering his troops and putting an end to the battle. On the viceroy's side, about 300 died, while the rebels mourned the loss of very few: just seven men. Pizarro was not merciless with his prisoners: Hern√°ndez Gir√≥n and Benalc√°zar, wounded in the fight, obtained honorable pardon. Just a few of the most obstinate followers of the viceroy were hanged or exiled to Chile. It was fortunate for the viceroy's men that the cruel Francisco de Carvajal was not there, or else none of them may have escaped death. The severed head of the viceroy was dragged across the ground to Quito, where it was placed on the pillory. Thanks to influential residents, the body and the head were collected for a decent burial in the cathedral of Quito, later to be transferred to the viceroy's land, √Åvila, in Spain. Thus ended the life of the first Viceroy of Peru. Notes References *. * Del Busto Duthurburu, Jos√© Antonio: La pacificaci√≥n del Per√∫.

She was briefly reclassified as a miscellaneous auxiliary and redesignated AG-121 during 1945. After the war, she was in commission in the United States Coast Guard as the cutter USCGC Humboldt (WAVP-372), later WHEC-372, from 1949 to 1969, Construction and commissioning Humboldt (AVP-21) was laid down at the Boston Navy Yard, Massachusetts, on 6 September 1940. She was launched on 17 March 1941, sponsored by Mrs. William T. Tarrant, and commissioned on 7 October 1941 with Commander W. G. Tomkinson in command. United States Navy service World War II South Atlantic operations Following rigorous shakedown training off the United States East Coast, Humboldt sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, on 13 May 1942 to join Rear Admiral Jonas H. Ingram's South Atlantic Force on the coast of Brazil. After stops at San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Trinidad, she arrived at Recife, Brazil, on 5 August 1942 and began tending the seaplanes of Patrol Squadron 83 (VP-83). During the months that followed, these patrol aircraft, operating with ships of the Brazilian Navy and U.S. Navy, patrolled the South Atlantic Ocean sea lanes and hunted Axis submarines. Humboldt supplied and repaired seaplanes and, in addition, carried aviation gasoline to outlying air bases along the Brazilian coast while engaging in antisubmarine patrols herself. While at Natal, Brazil, on 28 January 1943, Humboldt was the site of a conference between President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was returning from the Casablanca Conference, and President Get√∫lio Vargas of Brazil. This meeting helped to achieve even closer cooperation between the naval units of the two countries. After the meeting of the two presidents, Humboldt continued to visit isolated ports on the Brazilian coast with supplies and established a new seaplane base at Arat√∫, Bahia, Brazil, in May 1943. North Atlantic operations Humboldt headed north on 1 July 1943, arriving at Boston, Massachusetts, on 17 July 1943 to take up new duties in the North Atlantic Ocean. Departing on 23 August 1943, she carried supplies and parts to U.S. Navy fleet air wings in Newfoundland, Iceland, and the United Kingdom. She continued this dangerous duty, often sailing unescorted, into the early months of 1944, occasionally sailing to Casablanca in French Morocco as well. USS Humboldt (AVP-21) off Norfolk, Virginia, on 17 November 1944.Humboldt was at Casablanca in late May 1944 when she heard that a German submarine had torpedoed the escort aircraft carrier and the destroyer escort in the Atlantic, sinking Block Island and damaging Barr. Humboldt steamed out to help with survivors and to escort Barr to safety. Humboldt was soon underway again, this time to bring an experienced U.S. Navy submarine officer to rendezvous with the escort aircraft carrier hunter-killer group, which had just captured the in an epic encounter on 4 June 1944. USS Humboldt with a PBM Mariner flying boat of VPB-203 at Bahia, Brazil, in April 1945.Humboldt continued to bring supplies to aviation squadrons in the Azores and North Africa until 22 March 1945. Return to South Atlantic service On 22 March 1945, Humboldt departed Norfolk, Virginia, for Brazil. Returning to her original seaplane tending duties in the South Atlantic, Humboldt arrived at Recife, Brazil, on 5 April 1945 and remained on duty until the surrender of Germany in early May 1945, after which she departed Brazil for Norfolk on 10 June 1945. Conversion to press information ship Humboldt moved to the Philadelphia Navy Yard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 16 July 1945, for conversion to a press information ship. Reclassified as a miscellaneous auxiliary and redesignated AG-121 on 30 July 1945, Humboldt was to serve as a broadcast and teletype center for correspondents during the planned invasion of Japan in 1945-1946\\\\. However, hostilities with Japan ended on 15 August 1945, making the invasion unnecessary before her conversion was completed. Post-World War II and decommissioning Humboldt was converted back into a seaplane tender and was again designated AVP-21. She arrived at Orange, Texas, on 22 November 1945, for inactivation. She was decommissioned on 19 March 1947 and laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Orange. United States Coast Guard service  USCGC Humboldt (WHEC-372) sometime after the U.S. Coast Guards 1967 adoption of the \\"racing stripe\\" markings on its ships. Barnegat-class ships were very reliable and seaworthy and had good habitability, and the Coast Guard viewed them as ideal for ocean station duty, in which they would perform weather reporting and search and rescue tasks, once they were modified by having a balloon shelter added aft and having oceanographic equipment, an oceanographic winch, and a hydrographic winch installed. After World War II, the U.S. Navy transferred 18 of the ships to the Coast Guard, in which they were known as the Casco-class cutters. Humboldt was loaned to the Coast Guard at 24 January 1949. After undergoing conversion for use as a weather-reporting ship, she was commissioned into Coast Guard service as USCGC Humboldt (WAVP-372) on 29 March 1949. Service history During her Coast Guard career, Humboldts primary duty was to serve on ocean stations in the Atlantic Ocean to gather meteorological data. While on duty in one of these stations, she was required to patrol a 210-square-mile (544-square-kilometer) area for three weeks at a time, leaving the area only when physically relieved by another Coast Guard cutter or in the case of a dire emergency. While on station, she acted as an aircraft check point at the point of no return, a relay point for messages from ships and aircraft, as a source of the latest weather information for passing aircraft, as a floating oceanographic laboratory, and as a search-and-rescue ship for downed aircraft and vessels in distress, and performed law enforcement operations. Humboldt was stationed at Boston, Massachusetts, from 29 March 1949 to September 1966. She was reclassified as a high endurance cutter and redesignated WHEC-372 on 1 May 1966. On 26 September 1966, her long-term loan from the Navy to the Coast Guard came to an end when she was transferred outright to the Coast Guard. In September 1966, Humboldt shifted her home port to Portland, Maine. On 29 October 1968, she rescued the crew of the sailing ship Atlantic II. Decommissioning and disposal The Coast Guard decommissioned Humboldt on 30 September 1969 and transferred her to the U.S. Navy. The Navy struck her from the Naval Vessel Register in 1970 and sold her for scrapping to Cantieri Navali, Genoa, Italy, for a bid amount of $60,000 (USD).

The first of the other two, The Dead Wait, is a fictitious but conventional tale from the Angolan war which details a soldier's return to South Africa and his confession of a crime. Although based on the TRC, it is not overtly about it. The second, The Story I Am About To Tell, was produced by a support group for survivors giving TRC testimony, and starred three of them. on 26 May 1997.The world premier followed on 17 June 1997, at the Kunsfest in Weimar. Produced by the Handspring Puppet Company, and employing a multimedia approach in the tradition of Erwin Piscator and Bertolt Brecht, it combines puppetry with live actors, music, animation and documentary footage, while also drawing extensively on Alfred Jarry's absurdist production Ubu Roi (1896). It fuses the chaos of the Ubu legend with original testimony from witnesses at the post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC).  The TRC  In her \\"Writer's Note\\" to the 2007 book-form publication of the play, Taylor wrote, > What has engaged me as I have followed the Commission, is the way in which > individual narratives come to stand for the larger national narrative. The > stories of personal grief, loss, triumph and violation now stand as an > account of South Africa's recent past. History and autobiography merge. This > marks a significant shift, because in the past decades of popular > resistance, personal suffering was eclipsed ‚Äî subordinated to a larger > project of mass liberation. Now, however, we hear in individual testimony > the very private patterns of language and thought that structure memory and > mourning. Ubu and the Truth Commission uses these circumstances as a > starting point.Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. ii. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established in 1996 with what Taylor described as a \\"momentous mandate\\",Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. ii. to solicit testimony from those who considered themselves casualties, perpetrators or survivors of the apartheid atrocity. Coming almost exactly two years after South Africa's first democratic elections, the Commission's purposes, in Taylor's eyes, were \\"to retrieve lost histories, to make reparation to those who had suffered, to provide amnesty for acts which were demonstrably political in purpose [... and, among the most important] to create a general context through which national reconciliation might be made possible.\\" \\"The Commission itself is theatre,\\" wrote William Kentridge, \\"or at any rate a kind of ur-theatre [...]. One by one witnesses come and have their half hour to tell their story, pause, weep, be comforted by professional comforters who sit at the table with them. The stories are harrowing, spellbinding. The audience sit at the edge of their seats listening to every word. This is exemplary civic theatre, a public hearing of private griefs which are absorbed into the body politic as a part of a deeper understanding of how the society arrived at its present position.\\"Kentridge 2007, pp. viii- ix. Of how more orthodox forms could possibly compete with this, he explained, \\"Our theatre is a reflection on the debate rather than the debate itself. It tries to make sense of the memory rather than be the memory.\\" (Kentridge 2007, p. ix)  Plot  Pa Ubu (played by Dawid Minnaar) has been spending a great deal of time away from home, much to the concern and suspicion of his wife (Busi Zokufa), who smells on him an odour which she suspects may be that of a mistress. In truth, however, he is an agent of a governmental death squad, and the odour that she smells is of blood and dynamite. With the abolition of apartheid, the TRC is set in motion. Amnesty is offered those war criminals who come forward and offer full and truthful testimony regarding their infractions. Ubu, suspecting a trick, is unsure of what to do. The play follows his indecisive actions as they lead his path finally to a convergence with that of the TRC.  Conception, production and performance  Kentridge had been working for some years with the Handspring Puppet Company in Johannesburg before the idea for Ubu and the Truth Commission was mooted, and had extensive experience of theatre that incorporated animation, puppets and actors. He did not, he claimed, pursue the multimedia realm because of any aesthetic ideal, but rather because he was skilled in the art of animation anyway and was curious to see how it would combine with puppet theatre. Woyzeck on the Highveld (1993) and Faustus in Africa (1996) were successful tone-setters in this respect. The latter, according to Kentridge, was \\"a huge undertaking\\",Kentridge 2007, p. ix. after which he and the company were on the look-out merely for something small to \\"do and survive\\".Kentridge 2007, p. x. Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot seemed ideally suited to puppetry, \\"[b]ut we reckoned without the Beckett fundamentalists who would not give permission for us to leave out even a comma from the stage directions\\". In a bid to secure a neo-Becketian text (but not having the skill to write their own), and after rejecting several ideas, they considered a project called Waiting Room, which would comprise interviews with land-mine victims waiting in rural orthopaedic hospitals in Angola and Mozambique. At the time, Kentridge happened to be etching a series of pieces for an exhibition in honour of the centenary of Ubu Roi's opening appearance in Parisian theatre. They concerned a naked man in front of a blackboard on which were drawings of Ubu, \\"with his pointed head and belly spiral\\". Kentridge intended when the etchings were complete to animate the chalk drawings, which led him to the natural conclusion that the naked man might as well be animated, too. He asked a friend in choreography if she would care to have a dancer in front of screen on which a \\"schematic line drawing\\" of Ubu was to move about. When Kentridge realised that he could not immerse himself in both the Ubu and the Waiting Room projects simultaneously, he panicked and chose to combine the two. When the TRC took off, it became clear that he need look no further in his hunt for material, for \\"an avalanche\\" was streaming in every day. While he went about convincing the two parties to come together, he formed an ever-clearer picture of how the two could complement one another. The grave documentary material from the TRC could lend to the rampant burlesque, \\"which always had a danger of becoming merely amusing\\", a certain dignity and sobriety, while the untamed liberty which characterised Ubu Roi could shed new light and offer a fresh and lively perspective on the depressing affairs of the TRC. Looking at the play retrospectively, Kentridge did not feel that its shoddy provenance had maledicted it; rather it had accorded its writer, director and producers a gradually compounding platform on which they could \\"find pieces of the play, images, literary conceits, changing physical metaphors that we would never have arrived at if we had started from a sober beginning\\".Kentridge 2007, p. xi. \\"There is,\\" wrote Taylor of Ubu Roi and its main character's madness, \\"a particular kind of pleasure for an audience watching these infantile attacks. Part of the satisfaction arises from the fact that in the burlesque mode which Jarry invents, there is no place for consequence. While Ubu may be relentless in his political aspirations, and brutal in his personal relations, he apparently has no measurable effect upon those who inhabit the farcical world which he creates around himself. He thus acts out our most childish rages and desires, in which we seek to gratify ourselves at all cost. It is this feature in particular which has informed our own production.\\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, pp. iii-iv. Deeply affected as she viewed the TRC's proceedings by the frequency of the atrocities and the negligence and ignorance with which so many of them were carried out, Taylor noted that \\"those perpetrators who seem to have some capacity for remorse, appear to be shocked at observing, as if from the outside, the effect of their behaviour. Others simply show no response at all, so profound is the denial, or the failure of moral imagination.\\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. iv. It was thus her endeavour to pluck Ubu from the world of burlesque and action without consequence, and drop him in one altogether different: \\"It is as if Cause and Effect are registered through different modes of expression in the play [...].\\"  Puppetry  The play's conception began in earnest with a meeting between Taylor, Kentridge, Basil Jones and Adrian Kohler, who all agreed in principle to employ Ubu as a vehicle for exploring the TRC. Near the end of 1996, Taylor attended numerous workshops with the Handspring Puppet Company and grew to appreciate the actors' capacities and the style of puppet theatre. Also discussed were such transcendental devices as the three-headed hound and the embrace of various hybrid forms of animation and puppetry: drawn figures were hand-controlled and filmed on a sequential frame-by-frame basis. Taylor later confessed that her writing was greatly informed not only by Kentridge's direction but also by these experiences,\\"Further,\\" she wrote, \\"this theatre company brings a performance style of great expressive care to the characters, an element which has determined what kinds of testimony have been appropriate for inclusion.\\" (Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. vii) and believed that her colleagues were similarly inspired and edified. Taylor came to see great significance in the figurative role of the puppet, for its every motion was, in essence, tropical: > The puppet draws attention to its own artifice, and we as audience willingly > submit ourselves to the ambiguous processes that at once deny and assert the > reality of what we watch. Puppets also declare that they are being \\"spoken > through\\". They thus very poignantly and compellingly capture complex > relations of testimony, translation and documentation apparent in the > processes of the Commission itself.Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. vii. It was early on in the workshops that the decision was taken as a finality to have Ma and Pa Ubu played by orthodox histrions. \\"These characters thus exist, as it were, on one scale,\\" wrote Taylor. \\"The witnesses, who are represented by puppet-figures, exist on another scale, and a great deal of their meaning arises out of this fact.\\" Lewis Segal, writing in the Los Angeles Times, declared that the puppets incarnated \\"a helpless nobility in the face of great suffering\\", while noting that they represented only \\"a kind of supplement to a neo-Expressionist theatrical experience that the company defines primarily with human actors and film animation\\".Segal 1998.  Testimonials  In tackling the matter of how to portray TRC testimonials on stage, the first question was, according to Kentridge, an ethical one:Admittedly, it had been known from the beginning that Pa and Ma Ubu would be portrayed as humans, for the original, pre-project-merging intention had been for human dancing. The witnesses, similarly, were always going to be portrayed as puppets, as that was the premise of Waiting Room. \\"The more honourable route to the decision about performance style,\\" wrote Kentridge later, \\"is a justification after the event.\\" (Kentridge 2007, p. xi) \\"what is our responsibility to the people whose stories we are using as raw fodder for the play?\\" He was uncomfortable with using \\"real\\" actors for the reason of \\"the audience being caught halfway between having to believe in the actor for the sake of the story, and also not believe in the actor for the sake of the actual witness who existed out there but was not the actor\\". Using a puppet, on the other hand, would leave the audience with no reason to believe that the puppet or puppeteer represented an actual witness: \\"The difference between the materials of which a puppet is made and human flesh,\\" wrote Jones and Kohler, \\"can break the illusion that both exist in the same moment.\\"Kohler and Jones 2007, p. xvii. Kentridge confirmed that \\"[t]he puppet becomes a medium through which the testimony can be heard.\\"Kentridge 2007, p. xi. \\"In so far as I have a polemic,\\" he elucidated, \\"it is this: to trust in the inauthentic, the contingent, the practical as a way of arriving at meaning.\\" Jones and Kohler, head puppeteers alongside Louis Seboko, elaborated: > Their responsibility in the play is both central and extremely onerous, as > their task is to re-enact the deeply harrowing personal accounts of the > effect of the former Apartheid State on people's lives. Badly handled, such > stories could easily become a kind of horror pornography. The puppets assist > in mediating this horror. They are not actors playing a role.

As they > attempt to move and breathe as we do, they cross the barrier of the here and > now and become metaphors for humanity.Kohler and Jones 2007, pp. xvi-xvii. Each puppet was given two puppeteers, which bestowed upon it a metaphorical element of vulnerability, while also calling to mind the professional comforters who accompanied witnesses during TRC proceedings. These worked together to divide and cut down individual control over the puppet's movement and speech. \\"This,\\" explained Jones and Kohler, \\"encourages us to enter into the illusion that the puppet has a life and responsibility of its own. But the fact that the manipulators are present also allows us to use the emotions visible in the puppeteers' faces to inform our understanding of the emotions of the puppet character, with its immobile features [...]. Puppets are brought to life by the conviction of the puppeteer and the willingness of the audience. When an actor plays opposite a puppet, she or he participates in the same process. There can be no eye contact with the puppeteer. The actor's focus is solely on the puppet itself.\\" The endeavour was largely successful. \\"The plain wooden faces of these characters -- handled with enormous skill by Basil Jones, Adrian Kohler and Louis Seboko -- confer a power and credibility on their words that real actors could never achieve,\\" wrote crici William Triplett. \\"In such scenes actors will try to make you feel what their characters have witnessed. But an expressionless puppet, especially one 'speaking' the unspeakable through one of the commission's monotoned translators, engages the imagination awesomely.\\"Triplett 1998. The company was especially pleased with the decision to make use of witness-puppets because of the fact that the commission often had a translator to complement each testifier: \\"Two speakers for the same story and our puppets need two manipulators,\\" as Kentridge put it. \\"One manipulator could tell the story in Zulu and the other could translate.\\"Kentridge 2007, p. xii. This did not work, however, as the stories could not be heard, so the translators were placed instead in Ubu's shower, which served as a sort of booth, and difference was made between the authentic witness voice and the contrived public address of the interlingual rendition. A significant challenge to the skills of the puppeteers (especially those controlling the witnesses) came in the form of manipulating them at the right pace, a pace usually rather more sluggish than that of a normal actor, for it was important that the audience see precisely what it was that the puppet was doing. The puppeteers worked extensively with their figures to determine this, while also settling on specific moments of physical contact between puppet and orthodox human actor. An even greater challenge that the decision to employ witness-puppets presented was how to achieve a balance between the put-upon placidity of the witnesses and the delirious burlesque of Ma and Pa Ubu. \\"When the play is working at its best,\\" wrote Kentridge, \\"Pa Ubu does not hold back. He tries to colonise the stage and be the sole focus of the audience. And it is the task of the actors and manipulators of the puppets to wrest that attention back. This battle is extremely delicate. If pushed too hard there is the danger of the witnesses becoming strident, pathetic, self pitying. If they retreat too far they are swamped by Ubu. But sometimes, in a good performance, and with a willing audience we do make the witnesses stories clearly heard and also throw them into a wider set of questions that Ubu engenders around them.\\"Kentridge 2007, p. xiv. Although the witness puppets were never to be seen by Ubu and his wife ‚Äî they were situated in close spatial proximity to Ubu, behind his furniture, but made to appear elsewhere ‚Äî, their actions had a direct bearing upon them. The most important upshot of the decision was that witnesses could now show up in manifold nooks of Ubu's life, not merely (as had originally been intended) in the witness stand. It also engendered an experimental scene in which Ubu lies on a table looking up in a dream at a puppet as it testifies about its child's demise. It was tried initially with the witness behind Ubu's hips, so that his body formed a rolling landscape with a small rise from behind which the witness gave testimony. When the same scene was tried with the witness behind his head, it became evident that the best way to go would be turn the witness into a dream, and the story became Ubu's confession. Kentridge recalled, > We put the witness behind Ubu's legs again and he was back in the landscape. > We then tried to see how close the puppet could get to touching Ubu without > breaking the double image. Extremely close we found. And then we tried it > with the witness touching Ubu's hip with its wooden hand. An extraordinary > thing happened. What we saw was an act of absolution. The witness forgave, > even comforted Ubu for his act. These were a series of wholly unexpected > meanings, generated not through clarity of thought, or brilliance of > invention, but through practical theatre work. This is the second polemic I > would make. A faith in a practical epistemology in the theatre-trusting in > and using the artifices and techniques of theatre to generate meaning. The opposite was also true, however, as in his idea of a dancer before an image-bearing screen. Both the dancer and the image were to be seen together, generating an elaborate figure, but it became obvious within twenty minutes of starting the project that, \\"[f]or reasons of synchronisation, parallax, lighting, [and] stilted performance\\", it was incompatible. \\"Next polemic - Mistrust of Good Ideas in the abstract. Mistrust of starting with a knowledge of the meaning of an image and thinking it can then be executed. There is for me more than an accidental linguistic connection between executing an idea and killing it.\\" Throughout the play, and specifically when Ubu feels insecure about being found out, an animated eye, intercut with a real one in classic Kentridge fashion, emerges on the screen to convey the sense that the main character is not quite so alone as he would like to think. The screen was used repeatedly and effectively in Kentridge's production. \\"[I]n every instance the images are more suggestive than real,\\" wrote Triplett, \\"and hence more powerful.\\"  Allusions and symbolism  Several of the play's marionettes carry allusions to the work of Jarry: the Palcontents of Ubu Cocu, the protagonist's \\"manic acts of mayhem\\", find representation as lethal and destructive vices in Taylor's play with a three-headed dog. For symbolism more in keeping with the TRC, meanwhile, Kentridge was keen on including a paper shredder. \\"In South Africa at the moment,\\" he explained, \\"there is a battle between the paper shredders and the photostat machines. For each police general who is shredding documents of his past there are officers under him who are Photostatting them to keep as insurance against future prosecutions.Kentridge 2007, p. viii. A normal machine, however, did not seem especially creative, so, after abandoning representative bread-slicers (in view of the palling thought of wasted dough), animated projections (in view of Kentridge's reluctance to spend hours drawing them) and the dog's mouth (in view of its narrowness), they settled on a crocodile's mouth, to be carried as a handbag by Ubu's wife. This crocodile, then, played the role not only of Ma Ubu's handbag; it was Pa Ubu's pet advisor and cover-up man, too, concealing incriminatory evidence in his mouth . Three puppet-types, then ‚Äî the vulture, the witnesses, and Brutus the dog and Niles crocodile ‚Äî, were created. It was, claimed the puppeteers, \\"a fairly organic process\\",Jones and Kohler 2007, p. xvi. undertaken in accordance with the play's requirements. Each puppet-type had a unique and particular affiliation with Ma and Pa Ubu. The vulture, limited in its actions, was placed near the rear of the stage, where sporadically it offered sardonic aphorisms through a series of electronically contrived squawks that were translated on the screen behind it. \\"Thus,\\" wrote the puppeteers, \\"it is a form of manipulation: like gears driven by motors which in turn are driven by a remote technician ‚Äî which is appropriate to its function in the play ‚Äî an apparently authorless automaton spewing forth programmed truisms.\\" The crocodile was given but one manipulator to the dog's one for each head. They moved about freely and in the same space as the human characters, rather than being restricted in the traditional playboard sense seen in such earlier plays as Woyzeck on the Highveld. The puppeteers thought it difficult, though, to conceive of their being represented by human characters. Brutus, who speaks in verse, fills the role of Ubu's vicious henchman, stealing away with him to carry out atrocities: \\"Their culpability is indivisible.\\" Each of its heads had its own character: one was a foot soldier, the other a general and the last a politician. The body was created out of an old briefcase given Sir Sydney Kentridge (William's activist-lawyer father) by Braam Fischer. Similarly, the crocodile's belly was a canvas kit bag previously the possession of Basil Jones's father during military service in North Africa. The scheme of using bags for bodies served to provide a suitable of place of hiding for Ubu, an easy place of discovery for his wife and an ideal place for Ubu to plant incriminatory evidence by which he could distance himself from their crimes. Rather uniquely,In late September 1998, admittedly, when the play put in an afternoon appearance at the University of California, Los Angeles, it was followed the same evening by Teatro Hugo & Ines of Lima, Peru (a country quite familiar with the TRC concept), which employed the same technique. Ubu and the Truth Commission allowed its puppeteers free and undisguised reign over the stage, and took advantage of the potential for interaction between them and their puppets. It was agreed early on in the play's conception that the TRC witnesses would be represented by puppets with their speaking manipulators visible next to them, for that was almost always the case with Handspring. \\"When [...] Basil Jones, Adrian Kohler and Louis Seboko hold the hands of the puppet characters in some of the most intense moments of 'Ubu and the Truth Commission,'\\" wrote Segal, \\"it seems as much an act of consolation as the method by which the large, carved doll- figures are made to gesture.\\" The play retains a great deal of its ancestor's scatology, opening, for example, with the word \\"Pschitt!\\",Read \\"Shit!\\" (Taylor, 2007, p. 1) whose French equivalent, \\"Merdre!\\", invoked a riot at Jarry's premier in 1896. \\"'Ubu and the Truth Commission' dramatizes the politics of betrayal so graphically,\\" opined Segal, \\"that it eminently deserves its adults-only designation.\\"  Protagonist  Of her main character and his role in the play, Taylor writes, > Ubu's story is, at one level, a singular story of individual pathology; yet > it is at the same time an exemplary account of the relationships between > capitalist ideology, imperialism, race, class, and gender, religion and > modernisation in the southern African sub-region.Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, > p. vi. Nevertheless, Ubu retains in this play the antihero status first accorded him in Jarry's: he is a greedy, sadistic, homicidal, esurient, licentious apartheid police officer. Set against the TRC, \\"[o]ur agent is thus, in a sense, an agent of evil.\\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. v. Taylor justifies this with literary precedents like Paradise Lost, where John Milton, in William Blake's famous phrase, finds himself \\"of the Devils party\\",Blake c. 1790-1793, p. 6. her belief that \\"[n]arrative depends on agency; the stories of those who 'do' are generally more compelling than those who are 'done to'\\", and the nature of the TRC itself, which cast the victims as protagonists and gave little emphasis to other players. There was also, according to Taylor, another reason: \\"he provoked us. He is familiar but wholly foreign, he is both human and inhuman. He is the limit term which was used to keep an entire system of meaning in place, from its most extreme to its most banal.\\" \\"You may not sympathize with the character,\\" wrote Triplett, \\"but in the end you don't hate him either; instead you are left with the feeling that reconciliation just might be possible.\\" Although the play appropriates Jarry's agonist to the context of the TRC, it retains his archaic language and original slang, anachronising him as \\"a figure who lives within a world of remote forms and meanings\\". Ubu does not represent any particular figure in South African history; rather, he is \\"an aspect, a tendency, an excuse\\". Often, though, he speaks in voices reminiscent of those sounded at the TRC, his language set against its languages. As Taylor observes, > The archaic and artificial language which Ubu uses, with its rhymes, its > puns, its bombast and its profanities, is set against the detailed and > careful descriptions of the witness accounts which have been, in large > measure, transcribed from TRC hearings. Ubu is confronted within his own > home by those whom he has assaulted. It is the structure of the play, according to its writer, merging Ubu legend with the ongoing Truth Commission, that gives it its meaning, with patent theatrical consequences: > Perhaps most evidently, we are automatically taking on the burden of the > farcical genre which Jarry used. I remember having lengthy debates, with a > student, about the ethics of Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator, and > whether one could ever explore human rights abuses through a burlesque > idiom. My responses now are perhaps more complex than they were then. Taylor also noted that, in modern times of vast informational overloading, it was difficult always to respond, as expected, \\"with outrage, sympathy, or wonder, within a context that inculcates bewilderment and dislocation.\\" Her play, then, sought to reproduce the ambiguous nature of response to suffering: > Our own reactions are questioned, because, after all, what is it in us that > makes us seek out the stories of another's grief? Or, even more > problematically, what makes us follow the stories of the torturers? We > follow Ubu's history, are drawn into his family drama, are confronted with > his logics of self-justification. We as audience are also implicated because > we laugh at his sometimes absurd antics, and this very laughter accuses us. While its focus is obviously South African, its application, according to Taylor, is broad in scope: \\"We in the late twentieth century live in an era of singular attention to questions of war crimes, reparations, global 'peace- keeping'. We are, it seems, increasingly aware of the obligation to hear testimony, even while we may yet be determining how to act upon what we have heard.\\" Segal agreed: > Although the work should be a jolt for many Africa-watchers ‚Äî offering a > portrait of post-apartheid Mandela-land as anything but the best of all > possible worlds ‚Äî its key issues resonate far from that continent. Like > Americans during the Clinton scandals, for instance, Mrs. Ubu (Busi Zokufa) > fixates on accusations of sexual excess, not imagining that her lord and > master might be committing bigger crimes; when she learns the truth, she > immediately turns those crimes into media gold.  Reception  In South African circles, the play was well received. The Star dubbed it a \\"multi-dimensional theatre piece which tries to make sense of the madness which overtook South Africa during apartheid\\", while Mark Gevisser predicted in The Sunday Independent that it \\"will be for post-apartheid theatre what Woza Albert was for protest theatre: a touchstone of artful, affecting political engagement\\".Quoted in Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, blurb. In Los Angeles, Segal was all praise: \\"Director and animator William Kentridge skillfully integrates the movement of actors and puppets with his often startling animated chalk-drawings and live-action imagery projected at the back of the stage. 'Ubu' may be unrelievedly depressing, but it is executed with consummate artistry.\\" In The Washington Post, after viewing the play during a \\"regrettably brief\\" run of four performances at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, William Triplett described it to readers as a \\"stunningly theatrical multimedia piece that drives home the atrocity known as apartheid without ever uttering the words 'atrocity' or 'apartheid' or any like them. By turns chilling and hilarious, brutal and forgiving, the show casts a surreal light on the heart of darkness ‚Äî and still manages to leave you with hope [...]. 'Ubu' is one of those rarities, a piece of political theater that transcends politics. Its truth is human, but you can hear it only from the mouths of puppets.\\" It was widely agreed that Dawid Minnaar and Busi Zokufa gave fair and accurate portrayals of Taylor's Ubus. \\"Minnaar and Zokufa give performances that are wonderfully alive in this tale of death and redemption,\\" wrote Triplett. \\"Minnaar deserves a special ovation, since Taylor didn't write Pa Ubu as a monster, and Minnaar doesn't play him as one [...].Tiplett 1998. General production values, too, were lauded: \\"The dynamic sound, by Wilbert Schubel, is as complex as the entire range of emotions spanned by the show. Wesley France's lighting sometimes sweeps the bare stage, and other times pinpoints a small area, expanding and contracting focus when necessary.\\" After one performance, a Romanian woman, deeply moved by what she had seen, approached the cast to congratulate it. Surprise was expressed that a play of such local context could have been accessible to her. \\"That's it,\\" she explained. \\"It is so local. So local. This play is written about Romania.\\"Kentridge 2007, p. xv.

He is a Saracen king from Africa. The character appears in the Historia Caroli Magni, sometimes known as the Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle, a 12th-centuryHasenohr, 292. Latin forged chronicle of legendary material about Charlemagne's alleged conquest of Spain. In this text, Agolant, briefly, reconquers Spain from Charlemagne. In the subsequent war, several miracles occur, including flowers sprouting from the lances of the knights. Another war has Agolant invading south-western France and sieging the city of Agen, but he is forced to retreat to Pamplona. In a last war, Charlemagne's great army sieges Pampeluna. After the death of Agolant, Charlemagne's troops pursue the Saracens through Spain. Agolant is a central character in the late 12th century Old French chanson de geste Aspremont (before 1190Hasenohr, 106.). In this tale, Agolant and his son Helmont invade Calabria. In the end, they are defeated at Aspromonte by a youthful Roland, and in gratitude, Charlemagne gives Roland Helmont's horse (Veillantif) and sword (Durandal). Versions of this chanson were extremely popular in England, Italy (see the adaptation by Andrea da Barberino) and even Scandinavia.Hasenohr, 106. Agolant appears in Jean Bagnyon's 15th century La Conqueste du grand roy Charlemagne des Espagnes et les vaillances des douze pairs de France, et aussi celles de Fierabras (book 3, part 1, chapters 4‚Äì5), a work largely based on the Historia Caroli Magni, probably known to Bagnyon via the Speculum Historiale of Vincent de Beauvais. Through this tradition, Agolant(e) appears in the Italian romantic epics. In Orlando innamorato by Matteo Maria Boiardo and in Orlando furioso by Ludovico Ariosto, he is the father of Almonte and Troiano and his daughter, Galaciella, is the mother of Ruggiero III and (in Ariosto) Marfisa. In both, Agolant's son Almonte is killed at Aspromonte by a youthful Orlando, who takes his helmet (in Boiardo, Agolant's helmet was received from the wizard Albrizach.Boiardo, 408.), his sword Durindana (which had belonged to the Greek hero Hector; the defeated Ruggerio II, father of Ruggerio III, was a descendant of Astyanax, son of Hector) and horse (Brigliadoro). Agolant is also mentioned in Luigi Pulci's Morgante. Notes References *Ludovico Ariosto. Orlando Furioso, verse translation by Barbara Reynolds in two volumes (Penguin Classics, 1975).

It follows the book closely, as its author, Heinrich Spoerl, also wrote the script for the film. Both tell the story of a famous writer going undercover as a student at a small-town secondary school after his friends tell him that he missed out on the best part of growing up by being educated at home. The story in the book takes place during the time of the Wilhelmine Empire in Germany. The movie was produced and released in Germany during the last years of World War II and has been called a \\"masterpiece of timeless, cheerful escapism.\\"Georg See√ülen, 1994: Die Feuerzangenbowle In: epd Film 3/94. The movie stars Heinz R√ºhmann in the role of the student Hans Pfeiffer, which is remarkable as R√ºhmann was already 42 years old at that time. The title comes from the German alcoholic tradition of Feuerzangenbowle. R√ºhmann had also starred in So ein Flegel, a 1934 version of the same novel. Plot The title refers to the ' punch consumed by a group of gentlemen in the opening scene. While exchanging nostalgic stories about their school days, the successful but somewhat stuffy young writer Dr. Johannes Pfeiffer realizes he missed out on something because he was taught at home and never attended school. He decides to make up for it by masquerading as a pupil at a small-town high school. As pupil \\"Hans Pfeiffer\\", he quickly gains a reputation as a prankster. Together with his classmates, he torments his teachers Crey and B√∂mmel and headmaster Knauer with adolescent mischief. His lady friend Marion unsuccessfully tries to persuade him to give up his foolish charade and return to his writing career. Eventually, he falls in love with the headmaster's daughter Eva and discloses his identity after masquerading as his teacher Crey in school. In the last scene, Pfeiffer explains that everything except the Feuerzangenbowle scene in the beginning was just a product of his imagination, even his girlfriend Eva.

The film's release was in question when Bernhard Rust, secretary of education and former high-school teacher, bristled at the way the movie poked fun at teachers. To circumvent a ban by the censorship board, producer Heinz R√ºhmann presented the film to Hermann G√∂ring at the F√ºhrerhauptquartier, where it proved to be a success. It was premiered in two UFA Palace cinemas in Berlin on 28 January 1944. Historic context and criticism The transformation of the accomplished writer back to a not-so- innocent schoolboy is an example of the cheerful escapism popular in German films at the end of World War II. In 1942, propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels had called for the production of predominantly entertaining films in Germany to distract the population from the political and moral debacle of the war.\\"Unterhaltung und Ideologie in der Feuerzangenbowle\\" [Entertainment and ideology in the Feuerzangenbowle]; \\"Unterhaltung und Ideologie im NS-Film\\" [Entertainment and ideology in Nazi film], filmportal.de The charm of the teachers in the film lies in their old-fashioned attitudes and individual quirks. As representatives of an older, nonfascist generation, they were a nostalgic reminder of a lost past to the wartime generation in Germany. The film ridicules and at the same time celebrates this lost individuality through parody. Cult film status Since the 1980s, the film has gained cult film status at many German universities. During party-like showings in university auditoriums in early December, students bring props to participate in the movie's action similar to audience participation in showings of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. For example, the audience will ring alarm clocks whenever an alarm clock rings in the movie and use flashlights when Hans Pfeiffer uses a pocket mirror to pinpoint the location of the Goths on a map behind the teacher to help a fellow student in history class. In 2006, more than 10,000 students participated in this tradition in G√∂ttingen alone.Britta Mersch: \\"Uni-Kultfilm Feuerzangenbowle\\" In: Der Spiegel, 18 December 2006 References  External links  * 1944 films 1944 comedy films German comedy films German films German- language films German black-and-white films Films of Nazi Germany Films about educators Films based on works by Heinrich Spoerl Films directed by Helmut Weiss Films set in schools ","title":"Die Feuerzangenbowle (1944 film)"},{"id":"18848056","text":"Mary Nichols may refer to: * Mary D.

Despite its small size, it is the largest town between Helensburgh and Fort William. During the tourist season, the town can play host to up to 25,000 people. Oban occupies a setting in the Firth of Lorn. The bay is a near perfect horseshoe, protected by the island of Kerrera; and beyond Kerrera, the Isle of Mull. To the north is the long low island of Lismore and the mountains of Morvern and Ardgour.  History  Humans have used the site where Oban now stands since at least mesolithic times, as evidenced by archaeological remains of cave dwellers found in the town. Just outside the town stands Dunollie Castle, on a site that overlooks the main entrance to the bay and has been fortified since the Bronze Age. Prior to the 19th century, the town itself supported very few households, sustaining only minor fishing, trading, shipbuilding and quarrying industries, and a few hardy tourists. The Renfrew trading company established a storehouse there in about 1714 as a local outlet for its merchandise, but a custom-house was not deemed necessary until 1736, with \\"Oban being reckoned a proper place for clearing out vessels for the herring fishery\\". The modern town of Oban grew up around the distillery, which was founded there in 1794. A royal charter raised the town to a burgh of barony in 1811. Sir Walter Scott visited the area in 1814, the year in which he published his poem The Lord of the Isles; interest in the poem brought many new visitors to the town. The town was made a Parliamentary Burgh in 1833. A rail link - the Callander and Oban Railway - was authorised in 1864 but took years to reach the town. The final stretch of track to Oban opened on 30 June 1880. This brought further prosperity, revitalising local industry and giving new energy to tourism. Also at this time work on the ill-fated Oban Hydro commenced; the enterprise was abandoned and left to fall into disrepair after 1882 when Dr Orr, the scheme's originator, realised he had grossly underestimated its cost. Work on McCaig's Tower, a prominent local landmark, started in 1895. Paid for by John Stewart McCaig (1824-1902) the construction aimed, in hard times, to give work for local stone masons. However, its construction ceased in 1902 on the death of its benefactor. Built in 1897 for James Boutein, Glencruitten House was built on the site of an earlier estate. Now Category B Listed, the building is a Scottish-style castle, or Scots Baronial house, that was significantly altered in 1903. A library wing was added in 1927/1928. The original architect, Edward Appin, was also involved in the work completed in 1903. Robert Lorimer of the Lorimer & Matthew firm, guided the additions made in the 1920s for Alexander Mackay, the owner at that time. The House has been a B-listed property since 1971. The contents were to be sold off by auction in 2003, including some furniture designed by Lorimer. Reports at that time shed additional light on the previous owners of the House, indicating that the MacKay family \\"at the Argyll house\\" had owned the property for four generations, since 1917 when it was acquired by \\"the venture capitalist Alexander MacKay\\"; the original owner was listed as the Shelly-Bonteyn family. MacKay and his son Robert Ferrier Burns Mackay were said to be significant collectors of art, including works by \\"Sir David Young Cameron (1865-1945) and James McBey (1883-1959)\\". For some time prior to 2020, Glencruitten House was owned by a religious community who listed it for sale that year. The listing for sale provided additional specifics: the House contained \\"woodwork and panelling believed to be by Clow Bros and Louis Davis stained glass windows. Also within the library is an original grade A listed Ingram organ with Welte Philharmonic roleplay mechanism (not fully operational)\\". The listing also stated that \\"remedial work [was] recently undertaken by the current owner\\". Oban in 1900 During World War II (1939-1945) Merchant and Royal Navy ships used Oban as an important base in the Battle of the Atlantic. The Royal Navy had a signal station near Ganavan, and an anti-submarine indicator loop station, which detected any surface or submarine vessels between Oban, Mull and Lismore. There was a controlled minefield in the Sound of Kerrera, which was operated from a building near the caravan site at Gallanach. A Royal Air Force flying- boat base operated at Ganavan and on Kerrera, and an airfield at North Connel - built by the Royal Air Force. A Sector Operations Room was built near the airfield; after the war, this was extended to become the Royal Observer Corps Group HQ. Oban was also important during the Cold War because the first Transatlantic Telephone Cable (TAT-1) came ashore at Gallanach Bay. This carried the Hot Line between the US Presidents and USSR General Secretaries. At North Connel, next to the airfield/airport was the NRC (Nuclear Reporting Cell) of the Royal Observer Corps (29 October 1925 to 31 December 1995). Since the 1950s the principal industry has remained tourism, though the town is also an important ferry port, acting as the hub for Caledonian MacBrayne ferries to many of the islands of the Inner and Outer Hebrides. Climate As with the rest of the British Isles, Oban experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The nearest official Met Office weather station for which online records are available is at Dunstaffnage, about north-north-east of Oban town centre. Rainfall is high, but thanks to the Gulf Stream, the temperature seldom falls below .  Culture  The local culture is Gaelic. In 2011, 8.2% of the town's population over age 3 could speak Gaelic and 11.3% had some facility in the language.2011 Scotland Census, Table QS211SC. Oban is considered the home of the Royal National M√≤d, since it was first held there in 1892, with ten competitors on a Saturday afternoon. The town hosted the centenary Mod in 1992 (the year it became Royal) and in 2003 the 100th Mod, the two events attracting thousands of competitors and visitors (the 100th Mod was later than the centenary because it was not held in the war years). The Mod is held in Oban roughly every 6‚Äì8 years, and has last been held in October 2015. An annual Highland Games, known as the Argyllshire Gathering, is also held in the town. The Corran Halls theatre acts as a venue for community events, local and touring entertainers, and touring companies such as Scottish Opera. The town had a two-screen cinema, which closed in early 2010. Thanks to a local community initiative supported by a number of famous names, it reopened in August 2012 as the Phoenix Cinema. Oban has itself been used as a backdrop to several films, including Ring of Bright Water and Morvern Callar. The Oban War and Peace Museum advances the education of present and future generations by collecting, maintaining, conserving and exhibiting items of historical and cultural interest relating to the Oban area in peacetime and during the war years. A museum also operates within Oban Distillery, just behind the main seafront. The distillation of whisky in Oban predates the town: whisky has been produced on the site since 1794. The Hope MacDougall collection is a unique record of the working and domestic lives of people in Scotland. Music is central to Gaelic culture, and there is lively interest in the town. In the 2010 pipe band season, the local Oban High School Pipe Band, led by Angus MacColl, was successful in winning the World Pipe Band Championships in Glasgow, the Cowal Games competition, and the Champion of Champions for the year in the novice-juvenile grade. The town also boasts a successful senior pipe band. The local Gaelic choir competes regularly and successfully in the Mod. During the 2011 Guy Fawkes Night, Oban became briefly infamous for its fireworks display, which became a worldwide news and online hit when ¬£6,000 of display fireworks were ignited all at once due to a computer error. The display, which was due to last 20‚Äì30 minutes, was over in less than a minute. Pyro1, the company putting on the display, later apologized to the town by providing a free fireworks show. The town has been the birthplace and home of a number of well-known people.  Local attractions  The area around Oban has a dramatic scenery of the coast and mountains, as well as historically valuable local castles and ancient religious sites. North of the town the natural rock formation of Fingal‚Äôs Dogstone is connected in legend to the Giant's Causeway in Ireland.Fingal's Dogstone, Gazetteer for Scotland. Retrieved 25 May 2020 The Oban Visitor Information Centre, operated by VisitScotland, is located in the Columba Buildings on the North Pier. The Oban & Lorn Tourism Alliance also provides information about local attractions at the official web site.

It also has a railway station from where a number of Abellio ScotRail trains run to and from Glasgow Queen Street daily. The town is also an important ferry port: it is Caledonian MacBrayne's busiest terminal. Oban is known as the \\"Gateway to the Isles\\", with ferries sailing to the islands of Lismore, Colonsay, Islay, Coll, Tiree, to Craignure on Mull, to Castlebay on Barra and to Lochboisdale on South Uist. In 2005, a new ferry terminal was opened, and in 2007 a second linkspan opened, allowing two vessels to load/unload at the same time. Scottish Citylink run buses from Glasgow's Buchanan bus station several times a day; in summer, buses run from Dundee via Perth (route 973) and to Edinburgh via Stirling (route 978). West Coast Motors operate many local services and also coach links as far south as Lochgilphead and as far north as Fort William. Formerly, Oban also had direct passenger railway services to Edinburgh. The scenic line, which ran via Glen Dochart, Strathyre, Callander, Dunblane and Stirling, closed in 1965. Railway services north to Ballachulish on Loch Leven were withdrawn in 1966. (These services were withdrawn as a result of the Beeching cuts.) Oban has an airport outside the village of North Connel, some 5 miles NE of the town. In 2007, a further airlink was created between Oban and west-central Scotland: seaplanes fly from Glasgow city centre's Seaplane Terminal off the Clyde to the bay in Oban.  Schools  Oban has a primary school campus located in the south of the town along with Park Primary School at the north of the town, and a major high school, Oban High School. Secondary school pupils are drawn from a wide surrounding catchment area, with some pupils having long commutes to and from school every day. Students who live on surrounding islands such as Coll or Mull stay at a local hostel during the school week. The school funds the hostel so that the families of the students don't have to pay themselves. The building formerly used as Rockfield Primary School has now been taken over by the Community and is being extensively refurbished.  Churches  St Columba's Cathedral Oban is served by Kilmore & Oban Parish Church of the Church of Scotland. There are two church buildings in the united parish, namely at Glencruitten Road as well as Kilmore Church. The minister (since 2007) is the Rev. Dugald Cameron, who formerly served at St. John's Renfield Church, Glasgow. A third church, the former Corran Esplanade Church (opened in 1957 as Christ Church) at Corran Esplanade in the town, is now closed. A fourth church, St Columba's Argyll Square Church was opened in 1888 and closed in 1984 The mother church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Argyll and the Isles is St Columba's Cathedral at the north end of the Esplanade. During the 19th century, the Rector of the Pro-Cathedral was Father Allan MacDonald, a poet and Gaelic scholar. The present cathedral was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and constructed between 1932 and 1959. The Scottish Episcopal Church is represented in Oban by the Cathedral Church of St John the Divine, situated in George Street. It is one of two cathedrals of the united Diocese of Argyll and the Isles, the other being the Cathedral of the Isles in Millport, Isle of Cumbrae. There are several other churches in the town, including the Free Church of Scotland in Rockfield Road, the Baptist Church in Albany Street, Salvation Army in Stevenson Street, Elim Pentecostal Church in Soroba Road, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Lorn Christian Fellowship (Independent) both of whom meet at Oban High School and the Associated Presbyterian Church in Campbell Street. The Congregational Church in Tweedale Street was built in 1880.http://www.lochgilphead.org/CongregationalChurchOban/index.html A Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses is located nearby at 57 Lorn Road, Dunbeg.  Sport  Oban's proximity to the mountains and the sea means that a wide array of sports are available to visitors and locals, from scuba-diving to coasteering to sailing to mountain biking to winter mountaineering. Other activities of note in the town are: The local amateur football team is Oban Saints with a small stadium situated in Mossfield. However, shinty is a more popular game locally, with two major teams, Oban Camanachd and Oban Celtic, in the town. The Oban Times runs a \\"Spot the Shinty Ball\\" competition each week. Oban Cricket Club was formed in 2003 and plays in nearby Taynuilt. Oban Lorne Rugby Football Club turned 50 years old in 2012, and competes in the RBS West region. The Highlanders were a World Wrestling Entertainment wrestling tag- team originally from Oban. Oban Golf course was designed by professional golfer James Braid in the early 1900s, and offers a challenging 18 holes across difficult terrain. The West Highland Tennis Championships are held annually in July and attract some of Scotland's best players to the town. Past champions include Colin Fleming and Judy Murray. Oban also has a thriving martial arts scene, with karate, kick boxing, mixed martial arts, and boxing all available. Watersports are an obvious activity in a seaport, and sailing is very popular. West Highland Week brings sailors from around the world to the town every year. Scuba diving is also readily available. The wreck diving is spectacular, with the Sound of Mull offering some truly world-class dive sites. Although weather and visibility can be variable, the local geography means that a dive somewhere can always be achieved. Town twinning Laurinburg, North Carolina, United States became a twin town to Oban in 1993. The initial agreement was between Scotland County, North Carolina, and Argyll & Bute District Council. Following reorganisation in 1995, the agreement was confirmed by Argyll & Bute Council in 1997. In 1997, Oban was also twinned with Gorey, County Wexford, Ireland.

Plot The game is set in 1970s New York City. The player is a rookie detective from the homicide division. There are eight cases in the game, and one larger case divided into sections which occurs as an overarching narrative across the game. In this case, a former model named Betsy Blake goes missing. She is the sister of the player's partner, Marcy Blake. Gameplay The DS offers a variety of things on the touch screen. Memos, evidence, profiles of suspects and movements are done through the touch screen. In almost every case players must answer queries. These are often multiple-choice. If the player answers wrong they lose confidence from their partner. The game is over when Marcy loses trust in them completely, or when all cases are solved. In one case, some queries can be skipped. However, all queries must be answered to unlock a case after the player finds Betsy. Reception Unsolved Crimes has received a mixed critical reception. IGN called it \\"a solid graphic adventure with some unfortunate blemishes\\", praising the \\"variety of game mechanics\\" and calling the cases \\"genuinely engrossing\\", while criticising the presentation and graphics.

During a wet spring, the river often overflows its banks, sometimes flooding nearby houses. During a dry summer, the river is often reduced to a trickle. Within the city, the Seine travels a tortuously meandering course, reaching the Red River at St. Boniface just north of The Forks. The lower section of its course in the city marks the east-west boundary between the southern section of St. Boniface and the suburb of St. Vital. It is a typical meandering river with a single main channel embanked within a flat, shallow valley. The river's banks are heavily treed, but pollution has been an issue in the city of Winnipeg.

History The early history of the gem is quite obscure, though it probably belonged to Charles II, and was definitely among the jewels that his successor James VII and II took with him when he fled to France after the Glorious Revolution in December 1688. From there it passed to his son, James Stuart (the 'Old Pretender') who bequeathed it to his son, Henry Benedict, known later as Cardinal York, who wore it in his mitre. As the last descendant of James VII and II, the cardinal put the sapphire, along with many other Stuart relics, up for sale. It was purchased by George III in 1807 and returned to the United Kingdom from Italy. On the Imperial State Crown of Queen Victoria, the jewel took pride of place at the front of the circlet, just below the Black Prince's Ruby. In 1909, during the reign of Edward VII, it was moved to the back of the crown to make way for the Cullinan II diamond; it still occupies that position in the back of the Imperal State Crown made in 1937 (a copy of Victoria's) and used by Elizabeth II. The Stuart Sapphire is on public display with the other Crown Jewels in the Jewel House at the Tower of London. Description The sapphire weighs . It is oval-shaped, about long and wide, and has one or two blemishes but was evidently deemed to be of high value by the Stuarts. At some point a hole was drilled at one end, probably to introduce an attachment by which the stone could be worn as a pendant.

Together as Midi Mafia since 2003, they are most notable for their production of 50 Cent's number-one single \\"21 Questions\\". The MIDI Mafia has also produced for artists such as Sha Stimuli (the single \\"Clap At Ya\\"), Capone-N-Noreaga (\\"Yes Sir\\"), Bravehearts, Gemma Fox, Jean Grae, Talib Kweli, Young Buck, Nelly, Miri Ben-Ari, Lloyd Banks and Tamia. History Beginnings Bruce Waynne met Dirty Swift at Makin' Records Studio in Brooklyn, NY, while working on a project for Bad Seed. At the time, Swift was the in house engineer/beat maker for the project, while Bruce pitched beats and helped compose and perform choruses for Bad Seed. The duo officially began working together after attending a meeting with manager Tony Perez, who suggested that Bruce and Swift would make a good musical team. They began to hold meetings with different A&R; representatives and did spec work for various people, including Sylvia Rhone, who was the president of Elektra Records at the time. Initial success In 2002 Dino Devalie, who was preparing to sign 50 Cent to his label, approached The MIDI Mafia about using some of their beats for 50 Cent's debut record, Get Rich or Die Tryin. MIDI Mafia agreed, and though 50 Cent ended up signing to Interscope Records instead, their beats were used for the song \\"21 Questions\\", which was featured on Get Rich or Die Tryin. After the success of \\"21 Questions\\", The MIDI Mafia signed a publishing deal with Sony/ATV and a label and production deal with Elektra Records. They were also offered A&R; positions at Elektra and were being groomed to run Black Music. In 2006, The MIDI Mafia launched FamilyTies, an imprint label that allows them to sign and develop their own roster of talent. Singer/songwriter Deemi was the first artist signed to their label. The MIDI Mafia introduced themselves in to the Pop/R&B; world when they produced \\"When I See U\\", (song originally written for Tori Kelly when she was signed to Geffen Records) the second single from Fantasia Barrino's self- titled album Fantasia which held the number one spot for eight weeks on the U.S. Billboard's Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs charts.[ \\"Fantasia Barrino - Artist Chart History - Singles\\"]. Billboard. The song was written by Grammy award- winning songwriter Jane‚Äôt Sewell (which The MIDI Mafia discovered and developed), Bruce Waynne, and Erika Nuri. In 2007, the duo worked with Jennifer Lopez on her track \\"Hold It Don't Drop It\\", contributing as both writers and producers. Relocation to Los Angeles In 2008, The MIDI Mafia moved from New York to Los Angeles. After their relocation, MIDI collaborated with American Idol contestant David Archuleta, contributing a track on his self-titled debut album, released in November 2008. In the process of working with Brandy and James Fauntleroy II, MIDI Mafia met and began to work with Frank Ocean, whom at the time went by the name Lonny Breaux. Then, Frank was working as a lyricist, and approached The MIDI Mafia with a desire to become better at composing melodies. While with The MIDI Mafia, Frank Ocean wrote the songs \\"Quickly\\" for John Legend, \\"Bigger\\" and \\"Mamma‚Äôs Boy\\" for Justin Bieber. In 2010, The MIDI Mafia recorded Frank Ocean's mix tape, Nostalgia Ultra, in which The MIDI Mafia produced the song Swim Good. The mixtape was recorded by The MIDI Mafia engineer, Reggie Rojo Jr. The MIDI Mafia also collaborated with Frank Ocean as writers on the track \\"Bad Religion\\", off Ocean's debut album, Channel Orange\\". Branding In November 2009, \\"PHamous\\", a hip house song they wrote and produced, was used as a backing track for a flash mob at the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. The flash mob was conceived by YouTuber ShayCarl, who was assisted by fellow YouTubers LisaNova, MysteryGuitarMan, KassemG, Denise Vlogs, Traphik aka TimothyDeLaGhetto2 and HiimRawn. The flashmob video reached two million views within in 5 days of its release. Within the first 20 minutes of the song being posted for download on the Internet, 450,000 people downloaded the song, causing The MIDI Mafia‚Äôs website to crash. \\"PHamous\\" was used in promos for VH1 television programs and it was also used as the ending song for the weekly video of What da Faq Show which airs on YouTube and Facebook. On July 16, 2010, the video for \\"PHamous\\" debuted on YouTube on TheStation channel, a collaboration channel of most of the YouTubers of the original flash mob, including the lyric about being \\"friends with ShayCarl.\\" The song was also featured on the We Killed the Radio Star Podcast as the introductory and concluding piece of music during the episode \\"Don't Drink the Water\\". Vegas Lights On June 1, 2010, The MIDI Mafia released their own album, Vegas Lights, via FamilyTies. The songs \\"PHamous\\", \\"Last Call\\" \\"Mr. Vegas\\", and \\"2 Piece\\" were included on the album.THE MIDI MAFIA: ABOUT \\"PHamous\\", \\"Last Call\\", and \\"2 Piece\\" were also featured on Season 3 of the MTV show, Jersey Shore. \\"Mr. Vegas\\" was used for former Dance Moms star Kalani Hilliker's hip hop trio on Abby's Ultimate Dance Competition. \\"Mr. Vegas\\" features an Acme siren. The song \\"Lucky Tonight\\" was featured on Jersey Shore vs American Reunion, an MTV video used to cross- promote the new season of Jersey Shore and the release of the movie, American Reunion. Get Connected In the beginning of 2012, The MIDI Mafia released Get Connected, an EDM album. MIDI Mafia used the project to re-launch their brand. A remix of their song \\"Blinded By The Lights\\" off of Get Connected was used in a promotional trailer for Pauly D‚Äôs show, The Pauly D Project. On July 27, 2012, Conor Maynard released his debut album Contrast featuring the Midi Mafia produced \\"Pictures\\".

Looney Tunes cartoon short directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on March 24, 1956, and stars Tweety, Sylvester, Granny, and Sam Cat. The voices are performed by Mel Blanc and June Foray. The cartoon's title is a play on the phrase \\"sweet and sour\\". Plot Granny leaves the house for an afternoon outing, but as she drives by the house and waves goodbye to Tweety, she sees Sylvester has gotten into the house and is about to have Tweety for his supper. Granny furiously stops Sylvester in time and, fed up with his constant chasing after Tweety, gives him a harsh warning: \\"If there's so much as one little feather harmed on Tweety, it's off to the violin string factory!\\" (punctuating the warning by mimicking Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's \\"The Funeral March\\"). As Sylvester cowers in fear and sulks in the corner after Granny leaves, he tries to eat Tweety again, until he reminds him of Granny's threat (also imitating The Funeral March). As Sylvester goes back to sulking, in the corner of the room, Tweety is about to face a new threat ‚Äî Sam Cat (first seen in Putty Tat Trouble, but here seen wearing an eyepatch). Sam is after a meal of his own and is uncaring that Sylvester will be deemed responsible if Tweety is noticed missing. As such, the chase now casts Sylvester not as the predator but as the (not-so- altrustic) protagonist who plans to save Tweety from the predatory Sam before Granny returns ‚Äî moreso to save his own skin. After several exchanges, with both Sylvester and Sam clobbering each other, Sylvester finally gets rid of his rival by blowing him up in Granny's chimney (by way of a lighted TNT candle tied to a balloon). However, Sylvester's efforts are in vain. As he is putting Tweety back in the cage, Granny enters and, assuming he was after Tweety, promises to make good on her earlier threat. Sylvester tried to explain what really happened before declaring: \\"Aw, what's the use! She'll never believe me!\\", then he plays Chopin on his violin and falls into the violin case as a coffin to his demise.

Its major use is to facilitate the exchange of pathway data. Pathway data captures our understanding of biological processes, but its rapid growth necessitates development of databases and computational tools to aid interpretation. However, the current fragmentation of pathway information across many databases with incompatible formats presents barriers to its effective use. BioPAX solves this problem by making pathway data substantially easier to collect, index, interpret and share. BioPAX can represent metabolic and signaling pathways, molecular and genetic interactions and gene regulation networks. BioPAX was created through a community process. Through BioPAX, millions of interactions organized into thousands of pathways across many organisms, from a growing number of sources, are available. Thus, large amounts of pathway data are available in a computable form to support visualization, analysis and biological discovery. It is supported by a variety of online databases (e.g. Reactome) and tools. The latest released version is BioPAX Level 3. There is also an effort to create a version of BioPAX as part of OBO. Governance and development The next version of BioPAX, Level 4, is being developed by a community of researchers. Development is coordinated by board of editors and facilitated by various BioPAX work groups. Systems Biology Pathway Exchange (SBPAX) is an extension for Level 3 and proposal for Level 4 to add quantitative data and systems biology terms (such as Systems Biology Ontology). SBPAX export has been implemented by the pathway databases Signaling Gateway Molecule Pages and the SABIO-Reaction Kinetics Database. SBPAX import has been implemented by the cellular modeling framework Virtual Cell. Other proposals for Level 4 include improved support for Semantic Web, validation and visualization.

Their language is called \\"Logoli\\", \\"Lulogooli\\", \\"Ululogooli\\", or \\"Maragoli\\". The name \\"Maragoli\\" probably emerged later on after interaction of the people with missionaries of the Quaker Church. Maragoli also refers to the area that the descendants of a man called Mulogooli (also known as Maragoli) settled and occupied in the thirteenth century AD. Maragoli clans include the Va-Gonda, Va-Mavi, Va-Sachi, Va-Saniaga, Va-Vulughi, Va-Ndega, Va-sari, Va-ng'ang'a, Va- Yonga. (The prefix Va- refers to the people or descendants, and is sometimes written as Ba-, Ava-, or Aba-.) Origins  Oral history  Maragoli history records a migration from North-East Africa. The story of the Maragoli people begins with a man called Mulogoli. He was descended from Kintu, who led the progenitors of the Luhya to their current area from an area they called Misri, now known commonly as Northern Sudan and Egypt. When the Luhya progenitors first arrived in what is now northern Kenya, Southern Ethiopia and Southern Sudan, the ruler of the Luhyas at the time was Kitanga. The Turkana people later came to occupy the area where the Luhya ancestors had settled, and called it Lok-Kitang meaning 'the place of Kitang.' (Lokitaung is a modern town in North-Western Kenya).http://www.worldmapnow.com/images/2009/11/LARGE- KENYA-MAP.jpg Mulogoli was born from the union of Andimi and Mwanzu. Andimi had three wives: Mwanzu the mother of Mulogoli; Amugovolie who had no children and Ndiegu the mother of Mwenje or Anyole (these are the Wanyore, who inhabit Vihiga district together with the Maragoli). Naturally the Nyores and Maragoli are one, they are from the same stock, the stock of Andimi. Mulogoli had a wife called Khaliyesa. She had four male children. These four make the four major clans. The children were: Musaali; Kizungu; Kilima and M'mavi. In Maragoli, the word 'Abaluhya' or 'Avaluhya' is pronounced as A(b/v)a-roo-shia, ('b' and 'v' are interchangeable) which means, \\"the people of the North,\\" \\"the people of the higher place,\\" \\"the people from the North,\\" or simply \\"Northerners.\\" Luhya ancestors moved further south, probably along the Turkwel river. The Turkwel's principal source is the Suam river. Luhyas, a people who needed a constant source of water for their crops, animals and various industries like metalworking, and building, kept moving along the Suam River depending on various environmental or human triggers, into what is now Western Kenya and Eastern Uganda, and settled near the source of that river, Mt. Elgon. They displaced a people akin to the Khoisan of Southern Africa. and settled in their current homeland of what is now Western Kenya. The Maragoli people, lived in, and built what is now the stone-ruins of Thimlich Ohinga before the Luo moved into the area, and settled. Culture Luhya culture is comparable to most Bantu cultural practices. Polygamy was a common practice in the past but today, it is only practised by a few people. However, the Avalogooli people were traditionally monogamous just like the patriarch Mulogooli. Marriage was especially significant for young men as they were not allowed to own property before marriage. About 10 to 15 families traditionally made up a village, presided by a village headman - \\"Ligutu.\\" Ligutu/Rigutu means 'The Hearer/Ear' - as such a Ligutu can judge. Within a family, the man of the home was the ultimate authority, followed by his first-born son. In a polygamous family, the first wife held the most prestigious position among women. The first-born son of the first wife was usually the main heir to his father, even if he happened to be younger than his half-brothers from his father's other wives. Daughters had no permanent position in Luhya families as they would eventually become other men's wives. They did not inherit property, and were excluded from decision-making meetings within the family. Today, women can inherit property and often make decisions on behalf of their families as per the judgement of Kenyan law and individual families. Children are named after the clan's ancestors, or after their grandparents, or after events or the weather. The paternal grandparents take precedence, so that the first-born son will usually be named after his paternal grandfather (Guka/Guga), while the first-born daughter will be named after her paternal grandmother (Guku). Subsequent children may be named after maternal grandparents or after significant events. Some Maragoli names usually have names whereas others do not. For instance, names like Injugu (born during groundnut harvesting), Kabwoni (born during sweet potato harvesting) and Anzala (born during extreme drought) have meanings. Other names like Afandi, Inziria, Mwachi, Aliviza and Asava have no known meaning. Names of events are also common. For example, Imbarambara (born during road construction), Msuruve (born when a white missionary called Miss Reeves first came to Maragoli land) and Sirinji (born when money was first introduced in the land). Traditionally, Luhyas practised arranged marriage. The parents of a boy would approach the parents of a girl to ask for her hand in marriage. If the girl agreed, negotiations for dowry would begin. Typically, this would be 12 cattle and similar numbers of sheep or goats, to be paid by the groom's parents to the bride's family. Once the dowry was delivered, the girl was fetched by the groom's sisters to begin her new life as a wife. Instances of eloping were and are still common. Young men would elope with willing girls, with negotiations for dowry to be conducted later. In such cases, the young man would also pay a fine to the parents of the girl. In rare cases abductions were normal but the young man had to pay a fine. As polygamy was allowed, a middle-aged man would typically have 2 to 3 wives. When a man got very old and handed over the running of his homestead to his sons, the sons would sometimes find a young girl for the old man to marry. Such girls were normally those who could not find men to marry them, usually because they had children out of wedlock. Wife inheritance was and is also practised. A widow would normally be inherited by her husband's brother or cousin. Today, wife inheritance is uncommon to non- existent. In some cases, the eldest son would also inherit his father's widows (though not his own mother). Modern day Luhyas do not practice some traditional customs as most have adopted the Christian way of life. Many Luhyas also live in urban towns and cities for most of their lives and only return to settle in the rural areas after retirement or the death of parents in the rural areas. The Luhya had extensive customs surrounding death. There would be a great celebration at the home of the deceased, with mourning lasting up to forty days. If the deceased was a wealthy or influential man, a big tree would be uprooted and the deceased would be buried there, after the burial another tree, Mukumu would be planted (This was a sacred tree and is found along most Luhya migration paths it could only be planted by a righteous Lady mostly Virgin or a Very Old Lady). Nowadays, mourning takes shorter periods of time (about one week) and the celebrations are held at the time of burial. Ovogogo and rovego are post burial ceremonies held to complete mourning rites. Animal sacrifices were also traditionally practised. There was great fear of the \\"avaroji\\" (witches) and \\"Babini\\" (wizards). These were \\"night-runners\\" who prowled in the nude running from one house to another casting spells. Most modern day Luhyas are Christians and for some, (if not all), the word for God is Nyasaye or Nyasae. The word Nyasae when translated into English roughly corresponds with Nya (of) and Asae/ Asaye/ Sae/ Saye/ (God). The Luhya traditionally worshipped a god of the same name. When Christianity was first introduced among the Luhya in the early 1900s by various Christian missionaries from Europe and America, the Luhya took the name of their traditional god, Nyasae, forgot about their God, and gave that name to the God of Christianity, who, according to the Bible,is the father of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and whose son is Jesus Christ. The first Luhyas who were converted into Christianity applied words that defined some aspects of the religious traditions that they were born into and gave them to Christ and the Christian god. The Friends Church (Quakers), opened a mission at Kaimosi and the Church of God based in Anderson, Indiana took over the mission in Bunyore. During the same period the Catholic order Mill Hill Brothers came to the area of Mumias. The Church of God of Anderson, Indiana, USA, arrived in 1905 and began work at Kima in Bunyore. Other Christian groups such as the Anglicans (CMS) came in 1906. In 1924 the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada began their work in Nyan'gori. The Salvation Army came to Malakisi in 1936. The Baptists came to western Kenya in the early 1960s. The first Bible translation in the Luhya language was produced by Nicholas Stamp in the Wanga dialect. Osundwa says he did this translation in Mumias, the former capital of the Wanga kingdom of Mumia. There has been a strong Christian witness among the Luhya in the twentieth century. A religious sect known as Dini ya Msambwa was founded by Elijah Masinde in 1948. They worship \\"Were,\\" the god of Mt. Elgon, while at the same time using portions of the Bible to teach their converts. They also practice traditional arts termes witchcraft. This movement originally arose as part of an anti-colonial resistance. Various sources estimate that Luhya are 75‚Äì90% professing Christians.Abeingo Community Network 2002-Iriambuka; 2009-DC(Disi wa kavaga)  Other Luhya Initiation The Luhya, except for the Marama and Saamia, practised male circumcision. The Maragoli did not practice clitoridectomy. Traditionally, circumcision was a period of training for adult responsibilities for the youth. Among the Kakamega Luhya, circumcision was carried out every four or five years, depending on the clan. This resulted in various age sets notably, Kolongolo, Kananachi, Kikwameti, Kinyikeu, Nyange, Maina, and Sawa in that order. Like the Abanyala living in Navakholo do the initiation of their young boys every other year and notably an even year. The initiates were about 8 to 13 years old, and the ceremony was followed by a period of seclusion for the initiates. On their coming out of seclusion, there would be a feast in the village, followed by a period of counselling by a group of elders. The newly initiated youths would then build bachelor-huts for each other,the huts were called \\"simba\\" or \\"esimba\\" where they would stay until they were old enough to become warriors. This kind of initiation is no longer practised among the Kakamega Luhya, except for the Tiriki. Nowadays, the initiates are usually circumcised in hospital due to health benefits, and there is no seclusion period. On healing, a party is held for the initiate ‚Äì who then usually goes back to school to continue with his studies. Among the Bukusu, the Tachoni and (to a much lesser extent) the Nyala and the Kabras, the traditional methods of initiation persist. Circumcision is held every even year in August and December (the latter only among the Tachoni and the Kabras), and the initiates are typically 11 to 15 years Traditions have however changed with the dynamics of life, and currently, like most communuties in Kenya, boys are initiated at the time the parent feels appropriate for their children and is now usually done during infancy with symbolic rites of passage during their preteen years. Economic activities The Luhya are, traditionally, agriculturalists, and they grow different crops depending on the region where they live. Close to Lake Victoria, the Saamia are mainly fishermen and traders, with their main agricultural activity being the raising of cassava. The Bukhusu and the Wanga are mainly cash crop farmers, raising sugar cane in Bungoma and Mumias areas respectively. The Bukhusu also farm wheat in the region around Kitale. The Isukha of Kakamega area and the Maragoli of Vihiga raise tea, while the rocky land of the Nyore is used to harvest stones and gravel for construction. In Bukura area, the Khisa are small scale and only subsistence maize farmers. They also rear cattle, sheep, goats and chicken on a small scale. The Kabras of Malava area raise mainly maize at subsistence levels, with a few also farming sugar cane. With the rapid modernisation of Kenya, many young Luhya people have emigrated to Nairobi and other towns in search of work.

He founded the Central Catholic Library () in Dublin. Life Although he was born in County Down, Stephen Brown spent his early years in Naas, County Kildare, where his father was a solicitor and Chairman of Kildare County Council (1899‚Äì1911). He was educated at Clongowes Wood College and entered the Jesuit noviceship in 1897. He studied philosophy in Jersey, and was ordained in 1914. He initially taught at Maynooth College, and afterwards established the post-graduate school in librarianship at University College Dublin, an interest he maintained for some 24 years. In 1922 he set up the Central Catholic Library, where he later served as Director. He served on the Hospital Library Council and as Director of the Academy of Christian Art. In 1953 he received a certificate of Honorary Fellowship from the Library Association of Ireland, for his contribution to the development of the library profession in Ireland. While involved with the Central Catholic Library and other, mainly library-based, activities, he was also a prolific writer of books, bibliographies and articles of all kinds up to the end of his life. In September 1960, Fr Brown became incapacitated as the result of a serious road accident in London. A fractured skull and rib injuries forced him to spend four months in the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth in Grove End Road in London.

Career Mohamed El-Gabbas was playing for the youth ranks at Al-Masry at the age of 14. He then got noticed by a youth scout from Newcastle and he played alongside goalkeeper Roy Carroll and former West Ham striker, Andy Carroll in the youth ranks at Newcastle. After playing for a year for Newcastle's youth team, El-Gabbas unfortunately could not obtain a work permit and therefore was not able to sign a professional contract with Newcastle. As a result, El-Gabbas returned to his former Egyptian club Al-Masry. After two seasons with Al-Masry, El-Gabbas shone like a star scoring many goals in Egyptian league and cup competitions, leading to both Egyptian giants Al-Ahly and Zamalek looking to obtain his signature. However, he decided to sign for Belgian Second Division side Lierse S.K. in 2009. There he played comfortably alongside his Egyptian teammates Ahmed Samir, Sherif El Baily and Mohamed Abdel Wahed. He consistently played in a very successful Lierse season as they got promoted to the Belgian Pro League in 2010. As the years went on, El- Gabbas was always one of the first choice strikers along with Wesley Sonck and Soufiane Bidaoui. His impressive goal-scoring ability drew the attention of Egypt national team coaches Hassan Shehata and Bob Bradley and also some other clubs from bigger leagues in Europe. In an interview with El-Gabbas on Melody Sport, El-Gabbas stated that he is enjoying himself at Lierse and wouldn't mind staying and helping the team but he \\"would like to move to a bigger league in Europe in the near future.\\" El-Gabbas later stated that he has offers from French and Dutch teams and he would like to move \\"at the end of the 2012 season or in the 2013 season.\\" El Gabbas left Lierse S.K. at the end of 2012‚Äì13 Belgian Pro League. He signed with League One side Swindon Town. He left Swindon Town for limited playing time and signed Ligue 2 team Arles for six months. He returned to Egypt in September 2014 after his short stints with French team Arles the past season. He signed with Cairo-based club Wadi Degla, before returning to Belgium for a second spell. International career He was named to the Egypt squad for a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying match against Rwanda and Zambia. El-Gabbas was called to the national team more with current Egypt team coach Bob Bradley then before-coach Hassan Shehata. He has taken part in numerous friendlies and in World Cup and African Cup qualifiers. His last appearance was against Brasil in Doha. He did not appear for the national team after then.

The poem comprises 11, 376 verses (unusually long for a chanson de gesteHolmes, 83.), grouped into rhymed laisses. The verses are decasyllables mixed with alexandrines. In this tale, the African Saracen king Agolant and his son Aumon (Almons,, passim. Eaumond) invade Calabria and defy Charlemagne (Charles) through their messenger Balan (vv. 1ff; 604ff). Charlemagne's troops come to fight them, but Charlemagne's nephew Roland is not allowed to join the battle due to his young age (referred to as \\"Rolandin\\", he is not considered a full adult). The armies reach Aspremont, and Charlemagne's paladins Naimes and Girart d'Eufrate prove their worth. Roland joins the battle by arming himself with a rod () and mounting a horse (vv. 4969‚Äì71), and later commandeering Duke Naime's horse Morel (vv. 5749‚Äì5755). Charlemagne fights Aumon in single combat, initially protected by a helm with a jewel on the nasal that even sustains blows from Aumon's sword Durendal (vv. 5894‚Äì95, 5937‚Äì47). But Aumon strips this helm away and Charlemagne is in mortal danger, when Roland arrives (v. 6009). Roland defeats Aumon, and saves Charlemagne. Roland captures Aumon's sword Durendal and his horse Viellantif (\\"Wideawake\\", OF: Vielantiu), and his olifant (laisse 309, vv. 6075‚Äì80). Charles knights Roland, girding him with Durendal (laisse 377‚Äì8, vv. 7480‚Äì7510). In the end, Agolant dies and Charlemagne returns in triumph, although future battles with a disloyal Girart d'Eufrate are predicted. Versions of this chanson were extremely popular in England, Italy (see the adaptation by Andrea da Barberino) and even Scandinavia.

It occupies the building of the former Brigham Young Academy, which was built in 1892. In 1976, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. After a remodeling process, it was rededicated as the Provo City Library on September 8, 2001. History of Library Provo City Library was founded in 1905. It first opened in the basement of the Provo City courthouse in October of that year and operated until 1908. During its operation in the courthouse, it acquired 1,425 books donated by individuals in the community. Soon after that, the collection doubled to 3000 volumes by April 1908. On December 1, 1908, the library moved into a new building provided by a grant of $17,500 from Andrew Carnegie. Over the years, the library grew in size, by obtaining approximately 65,000 volumes and 125 periodical subscriptions.\\"Academy History.\\" 6 Aug 2008 <> In 1989, the library moved to another location, the City Center Building. Although it was bigger than before, it became inadequate within a couple of years. In February 1997 a $16 million library bond passed which allowed the library to move to a bigger location. The bond helped preserve and renovate the historic Brigham Young Academy building, which the library then occupied. On July 9, 1999, city officials broke ground to initiate renovations for the new library. Hyde, Jesse. \\"Visitors are awed by new Academy Square library.\\" Deseret News (2001): B05 On September 8, 2001 the library began full operations. History of Academy Square The library building was the site of Brigham Young Academy. The Brigham Young Academy was one of the largest school buildings in the western Rocky Mountain region. The Principal of the Academy, Karl G. Maeser, designed the building with the help of Don Carlos Young as architect. The Academy was located in Northern Provo. The name of the building has changed many times; in 1898, it was known as the High School Building, and in 1922 it was known as the Education Building, which it remained until 1968. For the next 20 years, Academy Square remained vacant and slowly began to deteriorate. While real estate developers were eager to tear down the dilapidated buildings, Provo residents supported the preservation of the historic site. In 1997, a municipal bond and private donations financed the renovation of the Education Building; the other three buildings on Academy Square were demolished to make room for a parking garage. Fundraising and restoration efforts were spearheaded by BYU professor L. Douglas Smoot, who gained the moniker \\"the man who saved Academy Square.\\" The groundbreaking ceremony occurred on July 9, 1999, and the Academy Building was rededicated as the Provo City Library on Sept. 8, 2001.

Much of his work is semi-abstract sculpture in bronze or steel. His work is in the collections of MoMA in New York, the Tate in London and the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris. Early life and education Chadwick was born in the suburb of Barnes, in western London, and attended Merchant Taylors' School in Northwood. While there he expressed an interest in being an artist, though his art master suggested architecture was a more realistic option. Accordingly, Chadwick became a trainee draughtsman, working first at the offices of architects Donald Hamilton and then Eugen Carl Kauffman, and finally for Rodney Thomas. Chadwick took great inspiration from Thomas, whose interest in contemporary European architecture and design had a significant effect on his development. His training in architectural drawing was the only formal education he received as an artist. He recalled: \\"What it taught me was how to compose things, a formal exercise in composition, really, it has nothing to do with the building it represents\\".  War service  In April 1941, having previously been a conscientious objector, Chadwick volunteered to serve in the Fleet Air Arm, and in 1941‚Äì1944 he served as a pilot during the Second World War escorting Atlantic convoys.  Beginnings as a sculptor  Sculpture on the steps of the Yerevan Cascade. After the war, Chadwick returned to Rodney Thomas where he became involved in the design of trade-fair stands. In March 1946, he won a ¬£50 prize in a textile design competition, which led to a contract to produce more designs for Zika and Lida Ascher who had promoted the 's' removed competition and who owned a textile design firm. Around the same time, Chadwick was commissioned to make exhibition stands for the Aluminium Development Corporation. Chadwick constructed his first mobile around 1947 ‚Äì which originated from ideas first proposed by Rodney Thomas. Very few of these works survive; they were made of wire, balsa wood and cut copper and brass shapes, often fish-like and sometimes coloured. Some were incorporated as decorative features in exhibition stands, while others found homes amongst Thomas and his circle. Later he developed ground supports for the mobiles, transforming them into what he called \\"stabiles\\". At the same time, he was designing fabrics and furniture. Recalling this period, Chadwick said: Lypiatt Park Desiring a better family life and more room to work, Chadwick left London in 1947, eventually settling in the hamlet of Upper Coberley, near Cheltenham. Here he converted outbuildings into a working studio in which he worked on his designs and his first sculptures. Lypiatt Park, Gloucestershire In September 1958, Chadwick bought Lypiatt Park, a historic manor house in Gloucestershire. The building is Neo-Gothic in style, with outbuildings and extensions having been added to the house both in 1800 and in 1870. \\"This place was the same price as a three-bedroom house ... and nobody wanted it, so ... I borrowed the money and came here. It was sort of wonderful, making another room habitable every year\\". He set up a studio in the medieval chapel where he installed the blacksmith's anvil. Chadwick made it his project to restore the house and garden. In 1986 he purchased the surrounding land in Toadsmoor Valley and began to place his work there. Art career In August 1949 one of Chadwick's small mobiles was placed in the window of Gimpel Fils, which promoted modern British art. The following year, he held his first one-man show there, which led to critical attention and several major commissions: two for the 1951 Festival of Britain complex, Tower and Cypress, and one, Green Finger, for the Battersea Park Open Air Sculpture Exhibition that year thumbleftLynn Chadwick, The Fisheater, 1951. Iron and copper. Height 228 cm / (90 in) Unique In Spring 1950, British architects, artists and designers were making plans for the celebrations surrounding the 1951 Festival of Britain. Jane Drew commissioned Chadwick to make a large-scale hanging mobile for the tower of her Riverside Restaurant on London's South Bank site, Tower Mobile. Architect Misha Black then commissioned Chadwick to make a large fixed sculpture for the garden of the Regatta Restaurant, Stabile (Cypress), made from copper sheets and brass rods. This work was significant in that it demonstrated Chadwick's transition from designer to sculptor. In April 1951 Chadwick received a commission from the Arts Council of Great Britain for a large sculpture, The Fisheater, also for the Festival of Britain. This was exhibited at the Tate Gallery from autumn 1951 through most of 1952. Working on this larger scale, Chadwick quickly became aware that the techniques required for welding iron, steel, brass and copper would need learning, so in the summer of 1950 he enrolled in a welding course at the British Oxygen Company's Welding School at Cricklewood, north London. Chadwick felt that this would solve the problem of creating large pieces suitable for public arenas. In March 1951 he was invited to exhibit with the American Abstract Artists Group in New York. In January 1952, Chadwick was asked to present to the selection committee of the XXVI Venice Biennale, resulting in his being one of eight young British sculptors who were invited to exhibit at the Biennale, including Robert Adams, Kenneth Armitage, Reg Butler, Geoffrey Clarke, Bernard Meadows, Eduardo Paolozzi and William Turnbull. The critical response was extremely positive. The poet and art critic Herbert Read wrote the introduction to the catalogue for this show, called New Aspects of British Sculpture. He described Chadwick's work, in what was to become a long-held interpretation, situating it alongside quotes from T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land against the backdrop of the Cold War: The success of the Biennale enormously enhanced Chadwick's reputation. Kenneth Armitage recalled that he swiftly transformed from a virtually unknown artist to an international name. Chadwick did not go to art school and had no formal training as a sculptor. Transferring his experience as an architectural draughtsman through to his sculptural technique, he began to weld in a unique and innovative way. He had started to develop a technique that fused solid form with the plastic energy of his earlier works, creating an \\"armature\\" of welded steel rods and a method of composition that played on the expressive potential of the framework and \\"skeletons\\" of his figures, while also constructing a firm, tactile \\"body\\". Chadwick built his sculptures using geometric space frames, to which he referred as \\"drawing in steel rods\\". He produced sculptures in iron, bronze and steel, which developed from mobiles to insect forms, animal forms and groups of male and female figures. Lynn Chadwick, Trigon, 1961. Bronze, 250 x 66 x 61 cm In 1954 having discovered the medium of \\"Stolit\\", an industrial stone compound of gypsum and iron filings which could be applied wet before setting, and when dry, chased to achieve the surface Chadwick desired - sometimes textured, sometimes smooth. He did not use clay or other modelling materials. The discovery of his new technique would prove to be an enormous turning point in Chadwick's working method. By the late 1950s he started to cast in bronze. For a long time Chadwick was the sole technical force in the production of his work. (It was not until 1971 that he opened a foundry at Lypiatt to cast jewellery and small bronzes.)  Venice Biennale 1956  thumbleftLynn Chadwick, Teddy Boy and Girl, 1979. Bronze 200 x 75 x 60 cm In 1956, Chadwick was chosen by the British Council as one of the lead sculptors to represent Britain at the XXVIII Venice Biennale. He was awarded the International Sculpture Prize, becoming the surprise winner and surpassing the favourite Alberto Giacometti, as well as C√©sar Baldaccini and Germaine Richier, and making him the youngest ever recipient of the prize. Following this critical esteem, Chadwick was talked of as the natural successor to Henry Moore as Britain's leading sculptor and artistic ambassador. Following the Biennale, this exhibition toured Vienna, Munich, Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels before arriving in London. In May 1957. Chadwick's first solo show in the United States took place at Saidenberg Gallery. Also in 1957, the Air League of the British Empire commissioned him to make a sculpture to commemorate the round trip flight across the Atlantic Ocean by the Airship R34 in 1919. Chadwick made a maquette, but complaints about the work caused the commission to be dropped. Chadwick is featured in the 1964 documentary film 5 British Sculptors (Work and Talk) by American film maker Warren Forma. Many of Chadwick's prints have been on exhibit at Tate Britain, London.  Later years  During the 1960s, Chadwick's work, which had been situated by critics within the aesthetic of post-war sensibility, fell victim to changing fashions during the rise of Pop Art. However, he continued to receive a steady flow of public commissions and private sales ‚Äì particularly in Italy, Denmark and Belgium. Chadwick was invited to participate in the Sculpture in the City exhibition at the fourth Festival of Two Worlds at Spoleto, Italy in July 1962, to create a large outdoor sculpture alongside nine other sculptors including David Smith and Alexander Calder. The result was Two Winged Figures 1962, his first steel sculpture, which was made at the Italsider steel works in Genoa. Chadwick and Smith became good friends during this period, and remained so until Smith's early death in 1965. Lynn Chadwick, Two Winged Figures, 1962. Welded Steel, 296 x 559 x 328 cm In a catalogue essay on an exhibition of Chadwick's sculptures and drawings at the Museum of Modern Art in Rio de Janeiro in January 1962, Herbert Read noted that Chadwick has consolidated his style and subject matter since winning the 1956 Sculpture Prize at Venice, saying ...\\"He is still preoccupied with states of attention or alertness in the human figure or the animal. His aim is to incorporate a moment of maximum intensity, and this he does by the most direct means ‚Äì the reduction of bodily attitudes to their magnetic lines of force\\"... thumbleftLynn Chadwick, Three Elektras, 1969. Bronze (black) 226 x 223 x 219 cm During the 1960s, Chadwick began to work in a more abstract style, producing works such as King (1964), which were influenced by Easter Island figures, as well as a series of colourful \\"Pyramid\\" and \\"Split\\" sculptures ‚Äì clean geometrical shapes made from Formica on wood. He also continued to create abstract human forms; male figures generally had blocky rectangular heads (as seen in 1960 piece The Watchers), while females had heads formed of more delicate diamonds or pyramids. By the end of the 1960s, Chadwick was working with complex groups of figures, notably the \\"Elektra\\" series. He also introduced polished facets to his bronze works, which would accentuate some part of the figure's anatomy, such as Three Elektras. Around 1968, Chadwick created works that used a matt patina over some of the bronze, but with faces or chests burnished to a high golden sheen, a technique already seen in works of sculptors including Armitage. This method appeared in Chadwick's Elektras and according to Chadwick stemmed from his desire 'to get a bit of contrast and colour'. In 1973 Chadwick had begun to clothe his figures in pleated drapery ‚Äì figures often were winged, with billowing cloaks, such as in Pair of Walking Figures ‚Äì Jubilee 1977. This continued in the 1980s, where works such as High Wind exaggerated the effects of wind. Clothed sitting couples also began to appear on benches, as Chadwick began to explore how far he could push his method towards naturalism. In 1985, he was created Officier [of the] Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, for which he would later become Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres in 1993. In 1988, he was appointed the Order [of the] Andres Bello ‚Äì First Class, Venezuela thumbrightLynn Chadwick, Crouching Beast I, 1990. Welded stainless steel 122 x 142 x 315 cm Chadwick returned to working with steel for the first time since 1962 in 1989. Using this method, Chadwick produced a series of \\"beasts\\", which varied in size and were often monumental. These works in welded stainless-steel sheets would come to be the final stage of Chadwick's development of his unique technique. The series began with Rising Beast (1989), with titles that allude to specific primal states of action: Beast Alerted I (1990); Howling Beast I (1990); and Crouching Beast I (1990). Chadwick is said to have delighted in the properties that steel afforded; no matter how dull the weather some facet of the sculptures would catch and reflect the light. Chadwick was invited back to the Venice Biennale that same year, for which he created two monumental figures, playfully entitled Back To Venice, 1988. Also in 1988, he was made an Honorary Fellow of Bath Spa University College, Bath. In 1991, he introduced the motif of a pair of female figures climbing and descending short flights of stairs, captured in contrary motion. This motif would also be combined with a single High Wind figure. The next year, in 1992, Chadwick was given his first British retrospective at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park. In 1995, he stopped working, claiming \\"There are only so many things to say and only so many ways to say them and I've done that now.\\" thumbleftLynn Chadwick, High Wind III, 1990. Bronze 200 x 112 x 114 cm Chadwick was appointed a Senior Royal Academician of the Royal Academy of Arts, London, in 2001. Chadwick died at Lypiatt Park in 2003, the same year in which he was given a major retrospective exhibition at Tate Britain. He is buried in amongst the pine trees near the seat where he used to sit and think, overlooking Toadsmoor Valley. He is survived by his wife √âva and his two sons and two daughters. In 2014, the centenary of his birth, a catalogue raisonn√© and a biography were published, four of his sculptures were shown in the Annenberg courtyard of the Royal Academy in London, and BlainSouthern staged exhibitions of his work in their commercial galleries in Berlin, London and New York. Personal life In 1942 he married Ann Secord with whom he had one son, Simon. In 1959, Chadwick married Frances Jamieson (d. 1964) and had two daughters, Sarah and Sophie. In June 1965 he married √âva Reiner and together they had one son, Daniel. √âva, who had come to Britain as a refugee from Budapest, would remain his constant companion, as well as a chronicler and cataloguer of his work.

He studied at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., from where he obtained his licentiate in theology in 1951 and doctorate in canon law in 1954 for a thesis entitled The Canonical Effects of Infamy of Fact: A Historical Synopsis and Commentary, which was published by the Catholic University of America Press. In June 1954, Rodimer was appointed Assistant Chancellor of the Diocese of Paterson and Secretary of the Diocesan Tribunal. During this time, he served as Assistant Pastor to St. Brendan's Parish in Clifton. He was later appointed first Diocesan Director of Sacred Liturgy. He was named Priest-Secretary of Bishop James J.

On August 27, 1977, at the East Germany-United States dual meet in East Berlin, Bottom broke Mark Spitz's five-year-old 100-meter butterfly world record with a time of 54.18 seconds. The night before the record-setting race, Bottom suffered from insomnia and took a sleeping pill only to oversleep and miss his usual pre-race warmup swim; incredibly, he broke Spitz's record anyway. He was also a part of the team that set the new 4√ó100-meter freestyle relay world record on September 1, 1974. In 2007, Bottom was inducted into the USC Athletic Hall of Fame; several of his records set at USC remain unbroken. He was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 2006.

He was primarily a decimista (or decimero), a singer of d√©cimas. He researched most forms of Afro-Peruvian music and dance, becoming the leading ethnomusicologist in Peru. Biography Santa Cruz was born in La Victoria District, Lima, Peru, to Nicomedes Santa Cruz Aparicio and Victoria Gamarra Ram√≠rez, and was the ninth of ten siblings. After his schooling, it was decided that he would work as a blacksmith, which he did until 1956 when he left his workshop and traveled throughout Peru and Latin America, composing and reciting his poems. In 1945, he met Don Porfirio Vasquez (father of the singer Pepe Vazquez), who became a decisive influence on Santa Cruz's development as a decimero, a composer using the d√©cima form. Porfirio Vasquez came to Lima in 1920 and was an early pioneer of the movement to regain the lost cultural identity of Afro-Peruvians. Santa Cruz assumed the task of reviving Afro-Peruvian folklore through a theater company he organized with his sister Victoria Santa Cruz (1959‚Äì1961), through radio broadcasts, and through his collaborations in the daily newspapers Expreso and El Comercio as well as other publications. In 1959, with his group Conjunto Cumanana, he recorded the album Kumanana, followed in 1960 by Ing√° and D√©cimas y poemas Afroperuanos. In 1964 he recorded a four-album set, Cumanana. In 1967 he attended the Canci√≥n Protesta Encuentro in Cuba, and recorded his poem \\"Benny 'Kid' Paret, which was issued on the album Canci√≥n Protesta. He made his theater debut in 1957 at the Teatro Municipal de Chile, with the company Pancho Fierro, in a show called Black Rhythms of Peru. He also ventured into journalism, radio, and television. During his travels, he continued to participate in events promoting Afro-Peruvian folklore, notably his address at the first Black Arts Festival, held in Ca√±ete, in August 1971. In 1974 he traveled for the first time to Africa, where in Dakar, Senegal, he participated in the symposium \\"N√©gritude et Am√©rique Latine\\" with his lecture \\"Aportes de las civilizaciones africanas al folklore del Peru\\". That same year he traveled to Cuba and M√©xico, participating in a series of television programs, as well as later trips to Japan (1976), Colombia (1978), Cuba, Canci√≥n Protesta Encuentro (1967), Cuba (1979), Panama (1980). In 1980 he moved to Madrid, where he lived until his death, working as a journalist at Radio Exterior de Espa√±a. In 1987 he began collaborating in preparing a series of LP record albums called Espana en su Folklore, a collection of songbooks from Spain and America. In 1989 he taught a seminar on African culture in Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic) and the following year participated in the expedition Adventure 92, touring ports in Mexico and Central America. He died of lung cancer on February 5, 1992, after surgery at the Clinical Hospital in Madrid. Legacy June 4, the birthday of Nicomedes Santa Cruz, has since 2006 been celebrated as a Day of Afro-Peruvian Culture.\\"Peru celebrates Afro- Peruvian Culture Day\\", Peruanista, June 5, 2008.

In 1927 the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft ordered the construction of four of these locomotives from the Maschinenfabrik Esslingen. They were based on a Saxon VI K prototype that already ran on W√ºrttemberg's 750mm routes and replaced some ancient Klose locomotives that worked the metre gauge route between Altensteig and Nagold. p 310 They were given operating numbers 99 191 - 99 194\\\\. To negotiate the tight curves the first, third and fifth axles were given side play. Engine number 99 191 was redeployed on 1 April 1944 to work the line between Eisfeld and Sch√∂nbrunn. In 1955 it was used in Gera. In the 1970s there was a plan to sell it to a museum railway, but the sale did not come to fruition and the engine was scrapped. Locomotive number 99 192 was retired on 5 May 1959. Number 99 193 was retired on 30 November 1967 and was transferred into the ownership of EUROVAPOR, where it is used on the Blonay-Chamby museum railway in Switzerland. It was still there in 2007.

This standard is used to prescribe the test method that manufacturers and test labs use to determine ink jet cartridge yields. It also standardizes the appropriate method of describing the yield of cartridges in documentation supplied to the consumer by the manufacturer. Manufacturers of printers or devices that use colour ink jet technology are meant to abide by this standard when testing for, and labeling the estimated yields of their products. The testing focused on sampling yields generated from typical business consumer printing applications. The judgment of total yield was defined by fade, marked by a depletion of ink in the cartridge, or automatic stop, caused by an \\"Ink Out\\" detection function.  Methodology: Notable Elements  All printers are to be set up using priming cartridges. These cartridges are for calibration purposes, and not used in the actual testing procedure. Testing of print devices is to be done in a semi-continuous mode at rated speed. It was noted that this type of testing procedure may not be typical of some common usage patterns for print devices, as in office settings for instance.

It is related to the USA-spec Honda Odyssey but is not the same vehicle. One of the major differences from the previous generation JDM Honda Odyssey was that the rear doors were exchanged to sliding doors typically used on minivans, whereas the JDM Odyssey used conventional doors. The USA-spec Honda Odyssey, known in Japan as the Honda LaGreat, was too large for Japan, so the Elysion took many styling cues from the LaGreat and used them on a smaller vehicle. In June 2012, the Elysion was introduced to the Chinese market. Production of the Elysion was ceased in October 2013 in Japan, but continued to be assembled and sold in China. Honda was inspired to name the vehicle the \\"Elysion\\" from the classical Greek word Elysium, or heaven.  First generation (RR; 2004)  The first generation Elysion appeared at the Tokyo Motor Show, on October 2003 as the \\"ASM\\", and was released for sale on 13 May 2004. A mild body restyle was introduced 29 September 2005, introducing an \\"Aero\\" and \\"VG Premium\\" trim level. 13 January 2006 saw the introduction of the \\"G Aero HDD Navi\\" and \\"VG HDD Navi Aero\\" edition. Another styling change was introduced 21 December 2006, including an interior update. The Elysion was offered with either the 2.4 L DOHC direct injection K24A with i-VTEC producing or the 3.0 L SOHC J30A V6 i-VTEC producing . The V6 was also available with \\"VCM\\" or Variable Cylinder Management. The upper trim level \\"Prestige\\" model was available with the J35A V6 used in the Honda Legend, producing and available with AWD. However, vehicles equipped with AWD had the engine power was reduced to . For two-wheel drive vehicles, this was more power than that available in the Toyota Estima, which was quoted to be . The concept This MPV was first seen as a concept car called Honda ASM at Tokyo Motor Show in late 2003 and finally made into a production half a year later with some cosmetic adjustments to its headlight, front grill and interior to make it more commercially friendly. Officially launched in mid-2004 for Japan domestic market. The design At 4840 mm, the length is identical as the 3.0L second-generation Odyssey RA6 or about 1 cm longer than current Camry. The 1830mm width is about 3 cm wider than the RA6 or about 2 cm wider than Camry. The different is on the clever space management making 70% of total space available as cabin plus the height of 1790mm, which is an extra of 18 cm from RA6 or about 24 cm more than the current odyssey. Safety The combination of a new 30% stronger high-rigidity steel, the Honda G-Con technology and the unique double platform with low central gravity floor, first seen on Merc A-class, makes Elysion (one box car) to achieve the highest 6 stars rating by Nasva and become one of the safest Japanese passenger car production ever, even higher than the competitor's luxury three-box (hood-cabin-boot) sedans. The high-rigidity body also benefited to the overall comfort as the car handles any rough roads with poise, free of squeaks found in many older Hondas The top-of-the-line VZ model is equipped with an IHCC (intelligent highway cruise control) and CMS (collision mitigation sensor) that works with radio- wave radar installed in the front grill to warn driver if he or she get too close with the car ahead and the seatbelt automatically tightening and brake ready, similar to the pre-cash system in the S-class. The radar can be double as night vision (a similar concept to the infra red night vision introduced in BMW) as it gives picture in a form of graphic of objects ahead displayed on its built in 8 inch navigation system at the dash. Other safety equipment includes ABS (anti-lock brake), VSA (vehicle stability), TCS, sideslip, and AFS (adaptive front lighting) on its projector HID Xenon headlight. Engine and brake At launch, two choices of engines are available. The 2.4L i-VTEC K24A that is used in the current Odyssey produces about 160 horses and 22.2 kg-m of torque. With virtually the same specs and gear ratios, it behaves and drives very similar to the current Odyssey and sips about 10,2 km/l in 10‚Äì15 Japan standard test (3 times variable city driving stop and go and 1 time highway driving with 120 kg extra weight of two passengers and without a/c). The compression ratio of 9.7 couples with an anti-knocking sensor and intelligent timing control makes it easy to take RON 95 grade. A similar 2.4L engine but with different overhead and higher compression ratio of 11.0 that produces 200hhp that is used in Honda JDM Odyssey Absolute is not yet available at this time for Elysion. The other is an all new 3.0L V6 i-VTEC J30A with the VCM (variable cylinder management), shutting-off 3 cylinders on one bank of the V6 when reduced power is needed such as during cruising or driving down hill. The only tell-tale sign that the engine is running on 3 cylinders is when the ECO green light at the panels light up. All Elysions are equipped with ventilated 4-disk brakes with ABS and EBD. Trims and specifications There are 6 different trim and grades plus 2 special AERO HDD editions. Three grade of 2.4L front-wheel-drive models are available, namely M, G and X. There are also three 3.0L front-wheel-drive models, VG, VX and VZ. Four-wheel-drive is optional on all models. Chinese market Honda announced to introduce the Elysion to the Chinese market in 2012. The Elysion was launched on June 7, 2012. The vehicle comes with a 2.4L i-VTEC K24Z5 engine, 5-speed auto transmission and is assembled locally by Honda's Chinese joint-venture Dongfeng Honda.

It was unveiled in the United States on July 30, 2009. The Kizashi went on sale in Japan on October 21, 2009, in North America on December 1, 2009, and in Australia and New Zealand on May 11, 2010. It is the first mid-size Suzuki automobile sold in the Australian market. In February 2011, the Kizashi became available to the Indian market. The car was also available on European markets. In 2012, the Kizashi was also sold in the Iranian market. In December 2013, Suzuki announced that the Kizashi will be gradually discontinued on global markets, and will not get a successor. In December 2014, the production of the car ceased in the Sagara plant. Despite a good technical record, the car had suffered from poor market record in the context of the global financial crisis and Suzuki's withdrawal from the American and Canadian markets in 2013 and 2014. Etymology Kizashi (In kanji: ÂÖÜ) is a Japanese word which means \\"something great is coming\\", \\"omen\\", \\"sign\\", or \\"warning\\". The Kizashi was to be Suzuki's flagship sedan and exceeded Japanese government regulations concerning exterior dimensions and engine displacement for cars classified as \\"compact\\". Description and models Suzuki Kizashi is a family sedan sized between compact and midsize models. It is available in base, SE, Sport GTS and Sport SLS trims. Interior Standard equipment includes front- wheel drive (FWD) and a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine developing and of torque. Available transmissions are a 6-speed manual or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The Kizashi offers 17 and 18-inch alloy wheels, Akebono sourced brakes, a choice of cloth or leather seating surfaces, and a 425-watt Rockford Fosgate audio system with iPod connectivity and Bluetooth capability (some models do not provide Bluetooth capability). All-wheel drive (AWD) (based on the i-AWD system featured in the Suzuki SX-4) is optional and includes a driver-activated FWD mode to save fuel. Safety The Kizashi comes standard with antilock brakes, traction and stability control, front and rear side airbags and full-length side curtain airbags. An enhanced stability control system is included with the available all-wheel drive. The Kizashi has a 5-star safety rating from ANCAP. Awards In 2010 and 2011, Kizashi won two AutoPacific's annual Vehicle Satisfaction Awards for overall satisfaction among all new midsize cars sold or leased in the United States. In 2011, Suzuki Kizashi named Best Buy by Consumers Digest. In December 2010, the Kizashi won two motoring awards in New Zealand: the Supreme Winner in the 2010 AA Motoring Excellence Awards and the New Zealand Herald Car of the Year Award. The car was praised for its astonishing attention to detail, refinement and comfort. India Maruti Suzuki, 54.2% owned by Suzuki Motor Corporation, launched the Maruti Kizashi on February 2, 2011. It is imported as a Completely Built Unit (CBU), which attracts import duties of 105%. It was priced at around 16 to 17.5 lakh rupees.Maruti Suzuki Kizashi Launched, Zigwheels.com, 2 February 2011. It has since been withdrawn from the Indian market due to poor sales. This model has a J24B 2.4 litre petrol engine with 4 cylinders, 16 valves DOHC. The 2400 cc engine is capable of producing at 6,500 rpm (manual transmission) and at 6,000 rpm (CVT). It produces of torque at 4,000 rpm. The Maruti Kizashi utilizes a direct ignition system for increased fuel efficiency with decreased emissions. With the help of this and other engine technologies, the car gives 9 km/L in the city and 12 km/L on the highway. The fuel tank capacity of the car is 63 L. Maruti Suzuki though, has not been able to sell many units since the Kizashi is petrol only (running a petrol car in India is expensive compared to a diesel), and the fact that it is expensive there. Pakistan The Kizashi currently is on sale only in Pakistan as it has been removed from other markets. Pak Suzuki Motors, a subsidiary of Suzuki Motor Corporation in Pakistan, launched the Suzuki Kizashi on February 11, 2015 at Pearl Continental Hotel, Lahore. It is imported as a Completely Built-up Unit (CBU) with no plans to manufacture it locally.

Problems On June 28, 2010, Suzuki recalled 5,107 model year 2010 Kizashi vehicles due to a glove box door that failed to comply with FMVSS 201 (\\"Occupant Protection in Interior Impact\\") in which the door could open in a crash. On July 30, 2014, Suzuki recalled an undisclosed number of select model year 2010-2013 Kizashi vehicles manufactured October 2009 through July 2012 due to spiders that may weave a web into the evaporative canister causing it to become blocked and creating excessive negative pressure within the fuel tank.

D. was written by Arthur Murphy and published in 1792. The work serves as a biography of Samuel Johnson and an introduction to his works included in the volume. Murphy also wrote a biography for Henry Fielding in a 1762 edition of his Works and a biography for David Garrick, the Life of David Garrick, in 1801. Background Murphy first met Johnson during the summer of 1754.Bate 1977 p. 322 Murphy was working on the Gray's-Inn Journal and, after discovering that a French article that they wanted to print was actually a translation of Johnson's Rambler No. 190, came to Johnson to apologize for his error. The two soon became friends, and Murphy began to tell the story many times later. Murphy was also friends with Henry Thrale and Hester Thrale, and spent time with all three.Lane 1975 p. 171 After Johnson died and John Hawkins published his Life of Samuel Johnson, Arthur Murphy began to attack the work.Davis 1961 p. xiv He used a Monthly Review piece to criticize the legalistic language employed by Hawkins to claim \\"that he is now rendered an incompetent critic thereby, and in consequence thereof\\".Monthly Review July 1787 p. 68 It was first published in 1792 as a prefix to a 12 volumes octavo edition that included Johnson's Works.Hill 1897 p. 353 This was done in a similar manner to Hawkins work which was prefixed to an eleven volume edition of Johnson's Works.Hill 1897 p. 357 Murphy, at the beginning of his essay, claims, \\"The proprietors of Johnson's Works thought [Hawkin's] life, which they prefixed to their former edition, too unwieldy for republication\\".Murphy 1897 p. 356-357 Murphy was paid 300 pounds for the Essay. Essay Murphy begins his essay by writing on the nature of biographical accounts: > \\"When the works of a great Writer, who has bequeathed to posterity a lasting > legacy, are presented to the world, it is naturally expected, that some > account of his life should accompany the edition. The Reader wishes to know > as much as possible of the Author. The circumstances that attended him, the > features of his private character, his conversation, and the means by which > he rose to eminence, become the favourite objects of enquiry. is excited; > and the admirer of his works is eager to know his private opinions, his > course of study, the particularities of his conduct, and, above all, whether > he pursued the wisdom which he recommends, and practised the virtue which > his writings inspire. A principle of gratitude is awakened in every generous > mind. For the entertainment and instruction which genius and diligence have > provided for the world, men of refined and sensible tempers are ready to pay > their tribute of praise, and even to form a posthumous friendship with the > author. In reviewing the life of such a writer, there is, besides a rule of > justice to which the publick have an undoubted claim. Fond admiration and > partial friendship should not be suffered to represent his virtues with > exaggeration; nor should malignity be allowed, under a specious disguise, to > magnify mere defects, the usual failing of human nature, into vice or gross > deformity. The lights and shades of the character should be given; and, if > this be done with a strict regard to truth, a just estimate of Dr. Johnson > will afford a lesson perhaps as valuable as the moral doctrine that speaks > with energy in every page of his works.Murphy 1897 p. 355 Before he begins, Murphy questions, \\"After so many essays and volumes of Johnsoniana, what remains for the present writer? Perhaps, what has not been attempted; a short, yet full, a faithful, yet temperate history of Dr. Johnson\\".Murphy 1897 p. 358 Critical response Dr Campbell, an Irish clergyman, complained about the vulgarity of Murphy's recollections of Johnson's actions: \\"Murphy gave it - on Garrick;s authority - that when it was asked what was the greatest pleasure, Johnson answered f***ing, and the second was drinking. And therefore, he wondered why there were not more drunkards, for all could drink though all could not f***\\"Campbell p. 68 Notes References * . * Campbell, Thomas.

Born in Reno, Nevada, David's family relocated to Brooklyn, New York, where he was raised. He attended SUNY Fredonia for one year and in 1976 received a B.F.A. from Parson's School of Design. David is classified as an abstract painter, best known for his use of the encaustic technique, which incorporates pigment with heated beeswax. He is also known for his works in mixed-media figure painting, photography and environmental sculpture. His work is included in the permanent public collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the Jewish Museum in New York, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, among others. Plasmatics and late-1970s New York music scene In 1976 David, erotic photographer Roy Stuart and Fredonia friend Richie Stotts formed a band called The Numbers, with David on bass. The group was a fixture in New York's early punk rock music scene, playing in clubs alongside punk pioneers Television, Blondie and the Ramones. David also played bass with punk innovators Jerry Nolan of The New York Dolls, Cheetah Chrome of The Dead Boys, Marky Ramone, Peter Gordon, David Van Tieghem and the free-improvisation noise music group Borbetomagus. In 1977, The Numbers were approached by impresario Rod Swenson, who was seeking musicians to form a backing band for singer Wendy O. Williams, whose radical persona he sought to exploit as punk music and performance art. The Numbers became The Plasmatics but the attention David began to gain as an important voice in the art world caused him to leave the band to pursue his burgeoning painting career.https://vasari21.com/michael- david-podcast-blurb/ Painting career David's first one-man show was in 1981 at the historic Sidney Janis Gallery. That year he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, at the time the youngest artist ever to do so, and in 1982 was awarded an American Academy of Arts and Letters prize. He went on to exhibit at galleries worldwide and was represented by Knoedler & Co. for the next 25 years. David is best known for using the encaustic technique of painting, which uses pigment combined with heated beeswax. David built his early career on abstraction and religious iconography, which formed the bulk of his output until 1999. Since then he has also experimented with representational painting and traditional photography. In 2000, he developed the \\"Chortens\\" and \\"Populations\\" series, about which prominent art historian and critic Donald Kuspit writes: \\"They are enigmatic works, all the more so because of the way their innumerable details form singularly monumental, intimidating wholes. Dense yet delicate, awesome yet intimate, they convey the fragility as well as grandeur of sheer being. Layer upon layer of paint piles up like layer upon layer of coral, but the textural result is more epic, not to say startling, than any coral island, and virtually any other existing abstract expressionist painting (upon which they are stylistically founded).\\" Donald Kuspit, Immediacy Redivivus: Michael David New Works 2002-2004, 2004 In 2001, David developed bi-lateral neuropathy due to being poisoned by gases released by overheated beeswax used in the encaustic process. The disease left him with partial paralysis of his legs, slowing the production of his painting for a number of years. That year, David began painting one of his best-known series, the \\"fallen Toreadors\\", inspired by 19th century French Realist painter √âdouard Manet's \\"The Dead Toreador\\" of 1864. Of the series, David has said, \\"My work (became) about compassion. Compassion for those different from us, compassion for each other, and, most importantly, compassion for oneself, for a painter who was reckless enough to hurt himself doing what he loves most.\\" Photography In 1993, David experimented at the \\"20x24\\" Polaroid studio in Manhattan, which resulted in a series of portraits of playwright Edward Albee and of friend Jackie Gross, which would become the ongoing \\"Jackie\\" series of mixed-media works. When neuropathy rendered him unable to paint during 2003, he returned to the 20x24 camera and shot large-format Polaroids inspired by Caravaggio; nude men and women dressed as Toreadors, and religious imagery. Environmental sculpture - The Greenhouse Project In 2002, David began to develop The Greenhouse Project, an evolving \\"architectural construct\\" based on historical American Antebellum greenhouses built using the actual glass negatives sold to starving farmers in the post- American Civil War South. David has indicated that each greenhouse will, through the display of photography and use of social networking, create a forum and exhibit for ideas and artifacts related to civil and human rights; the specifications of each greenhouse particular to the community in which each is built. Critical response David's work was reviewed in Artforum and Art in America, and is considered one of the last links to the New York School of painting. Art historian Donald Kuspit characterized David‚Äôs paintings in the following essay; \\"Michael David‚Äôs abstract paintings renew immediacy, indeed, reconstitute, strengthen, and even apotheosize it. They raise it to a feverishly fresh intensity with their remarkable touch, indicating they are among the very best painterly abstractions made. To me they make it transparently clear that immediacy may be an illusion to the intellect but it is not one for the senses‚Äîfor touch and sight, mingled together inextricably in ecstatic perception. For them, painterly immediacy is ultimate reality: pure sensuous intensity transcendent of ordinary, habitual understanding of the world, which is mediated by socially sanctioned language and banal meanings that force sense experience into their procrustean bed. David may be the most innovative master of immediate surface since the abstract expressionists. He has acknowledged his debt to Abstract Expressionism, but he has transformed it. Where the abstract expressionist paintings of the forties and fifties seem like modern cave paintings, as their crude, unfocused, often meandering, turbulent painterliness suggests, and as such to reinstate prehistory, David seems to turn the cave into a temple, as his more considered, concentrated, indeed, dense, contemplative painterliness indicates, so that his paintings have the aura of post history. The sublime is gained with no loss of force‚Äîno sacrifice of painterly dynamics. Indeed, there is a gain in the sense of bodiliness: each of his works has a certain ‚Äúbody‚Äù‚Äîdensity of presence‚Äîso that it seems to embody the sublime, not simply evoke it. His paintings make the abstract sublime vividly concrete, as though it could be grasped rather than existed as some numinous beyond.\\"Donald Kuspit, Immediacy Redivivus: Michael David New Works 2002-2004, 2004  Notes  1954 births Living people 20th-century American painters American male painters 21st-century American painters Parsons School of Design alumni ","title":"Michael David (painter)"},{"id":"18848928","text":"≈ûahm…ômm…ôdli (also, Shakhmamedli and Shakhmetli) is a village in the Goranboy Rayon of Azerbaijan.

The short takes place at a shantytown; hence the name \\"The Shanty Where Santy Claus Lives\\". Plot On Christmas Eve, a sad and lonely boy, walks past a church, and listening the people inside sing, Silent night. He walks past a house, and watches the people celebrate Christmas with their family. Suddenly, a gust of wind blows, knocks him against the wall of a nearby tool shed, and covers him in snow. When he returns home, the boy opens his stocking, and discovers nothing inside. As he lies in a chair there crying, he hears the sound of sleigh bells ringing. He goes by the window, and sees that it's Santa Claus! The boy joins Santa for some holiday fun in the shanty where he lives, since the boy has been good all year. The joy in Santa's shanty includes singing toys, a jazz band, and a singing doll. Eventually, a Christmas tree catches fire, and everybody does what they can too put it out. The boy manages to put out the fire by connecting a hose to bagpipes, squirting the tree, and putting out the fire. Everybody cheers as the cartoon ends.

Anatomically, the abductor pollicis brevis and first dorsal interosseous muscle are more wasted than the abductor digiti minimi. If lesions affecting the branches of the ulnar nerve that run to the wasted muscles are excluded, the lesion is almost sure to be located in the anterior horn of the spinal cord at the C8-T1 level.Split hand syndrome. Stedman's Medical Dictionary. Retrieved August 13, 2008. It has been proposed as a relatively specific sign for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease). It can also occur in other disorders affecting the anterior horn, such as spinal muscular atrophy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, poliomyelitis and progressive muscular atrophy. A slow onset and a lack of pain or sensorial symptoms are arguments against a lesion of the spinal root or plexus brachialis. To an extent, these features can also be seen in normal aging (although technically, the apparent muscle wasting is sarcopenia rather than atrophy). The term split hand syndrome was first coined in 1994 by a researcher from the Cleveland Clinic called Asa J. Wilbourn.

It is also a local government community of the same name. At the 2001 census the population was 16,774, reducing slightly to 16,600 at the 2011 Census. The district is named after the headland of Mumbles which is located on the southeast corner of the district. History Oystermouth Castle, a venue for open air Shakespearean performances The Mumbles light house 1815 Mumbles, 1850s Archaeological evidence indicates that an ancient submerged forest was located on what is now the foreshore of Mumbles Bay The bones of bears, wolves, hyenas, deer, rhinoceros and mammoth have been discovered there. A bone cave at the western tip of Caswell Bay was excavated in 1832 but has since been destroyed by the sea. Another cave, at the Inner Sound, Mumbles Head, was blown up by quarrymen in 1838 but not before elephant bones had been found. Also scattered around the bays of Mumbles and Gower are the bones of sixteen Ice Age mammals, including a mammoth tooth measuring ten centimetres across, which is on display in Swansea Museum. The first human crop growers arrived in the area over 5,000 years ago. However, evidence of human habitation is much older and possibly dates as far back as 30,000 years ago‚Äîestablished by the dating of the famous Paviland skeleton located in a cave some 10‚Äì15 miles along the coast from Mumbles Head. The skeleton is kept in the Oxford Museum of Natural History, having been excavated by Rev William Buckland, who was Professor of Geology at Oxford University at the time. However, Swansea Museum has two well-finished flint axe-heads, one from Newton and one from an allotment on Mumbles Hill. Much of what we know about the first metalworkers, in the Bronze Age, has been learned from their tombs: pieces of pottery, a cairn and remains of a hut were found. The cliffs above the Redcliffe flats at Caswell Bay contain the ridged remnants of a Redley Cliff Iron Age hill-fort. There is evidence that the Romans were based in Mumbles in a villa on the site of the present All Saints Church in Oystermouth. When the site was being extended in 1860, workmen removing a bank of earth on the south side of the original building accidentally broke up a Roman tessellated pavement, or mosaic floor. This was previously a pagan site, as were many sites of worship in the UK which subsequently became places of worship at the onset of Christianity. In this area it has been reported that Romano British gentlemen of Roman Wales may have eaten oysters from the oysterbeds off the shore below the site at Oystermouth, or Ystumllwynarth. The Norman Castle at Oystermouth was built during the first half of the 12th century - one of many castles built in Gower as a defense against the native Welsh Princes who sought to re-claim the lands stolen by the Norman invaders. [the Royal Commission on Ancient & Historical Monuments in Wales, Glamorgan, The Early Castles, London, HMSO, 1991]. The architectural merits of the church, castle and other buildings in Oystermouth are discussed in J.Newman, The Buildings of Wales: Glamorgan, London, Penguin/University of Wales Press, 1995. Mumbles seafront Three of the bells in All Saints Church once belonged to the Jesuit church of La Compa√±√≠a (\\"The Company\\") in Santiago, Chile. They seem to have been brought to Mumbles by Aubrey Vivian after the fire of 1863 burnt down the Jesuit church, killing 2,000 people. The family of industrialist Henry Vivian had business connections with the copper mines of Chile. In 1793, the Mumbles Lighthouse was erected on the outer of the two tidal islands of Mumbles Head. In 1806, the Oystermouth Railway was built between Oystermouth and Swansea with the intention of carrying coal to Swansea. The potential for carrying passengers was soon seen and a horse-drawn railway passenger service was started on 25 March 1807, making it the first such service in the world. It became enormously popular and was commonly called 'the Mumbles train'. Following the development of the rail service, Mumbles became a popular tourist destination. To capitalise on this, the Mumbles railway was extended and a pier was constructed and opened in 1898 to serve as the new terminus. An RNLI lifeboat slipway was added to the pier in the summer of 1916 and a boathouse was finally built on it in 1922; these remain in use. [Needs updating as there is a new boathouse]. On 23 April 1947, the Mumbles lifeboat lost a crew of eight men while attempting to rescue the crew of the Samtampa that had run aground on Sker Point. The Mumbles railway was closed in January 1960 and dismantled - a controversial decision that still resonates in the locality (calls to \\"bring back the Mumbles train\\" are still frequently heard and printed in local newspapers). Soon after it was built in 1898, the end of the Mumbles Pier became home to Bandstand Concerts and on the landward side was a Winter Garden both of which attracted large crowds. It was advertised by the Swansea and Mumbles Railway as 'The Prettiest Pier in the Bristol Channel' and the 'Mumbles Press' on 13 April 1911, featured the Skating Rinks as well as Hanney's Select Military Band. In the 1950s, a large entertainment center on the end of the Pier included 'Dodgems' Coconut Shies and other fairground attractions. Near the bridge to the lifeboat, two Amusement Kiosks survived from Edwardian days. The landward side of the Pier had a Cafe, with a 'Penny Slot Arcade' alongside and a popular Dance Hall was part of the 'Pier Hotel.' The amusement complex was redeveloped at the land end of the Mumbles Pier in 1966 and this proved to be a profitable attraction to visitors, resulting in the addition of a new building containing an amusement arcade, restaurant and bowling alley. Swansea Lifeboat Station from Mumbles Pier The 'Mumbles Mile' is a stretch of road in Mumbles once notable for its concentration of pubs. It has long been a popular destination for pub crawls and binge drinking. Famous poet Dylan Thomas was said to have enjoyed many hours at The Mermaid. The 'Mumbles Mile' began to decline in popularity during the 1990s because of pressure from the local council and increased competition from Swansea's night attractions. Now, there are only five pubs on the 'mile', whereas there were once upwards of 20. The Encyclopedia of Wales says that Mumbles has always been considered a place apart... as the verse puts it: :Mumbles is a funny place, :A church without a steeple, :Houses made of old ships wrecked :And most peculiar people.The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales. Cardiff: University of Wales Press 2008 The origin of the name \\"Mumbles\\" is obscure. Wyn Owen and Morgan (2008) cite several possibilities: Middle English momele (\\"to mumble\\"), describing the \\"mumbling\\" of the sea next to the rocks; Latin mamillae meaning \\"breasts\\", in reference to the breast shaped silhouette of the islands and headland, and Old Norse m√∫li (snout, promontory).Wyn Owen, H. and Morgan, R.

In 1932 a kolkhoz which functions to this day was established here, followed by the inclusion of the village in the Shahumian region. Historically the population was composed almost entirely of ethnic Russians and numbered over 2,000 people at its peak. In 1992, Rus Borisi happened to be in the thick of ethnic clashes between ethnic Armenians and Azeris, leading to a military operation and resulting in the mass exodus of the Armenians of Shahumian. The region itself was merged with the Goranboy region. Even though Rus Borisi, similarly to the Azeri villages of the region, remained unaffected by the military actions,Alexander Prokhanov.

The economy of the village is closely tied to the function of the Kalinin kolkhoz, considered a 'millionaire kolkhoz' back in the Soviet times. As of the late 1970s, it possessed 600 hectares of arable land, five poultry farms with 2,000 layers, a cattle farm of 300 milch cows and 800 head of young bulls and horses. In the 1990s the kolkhoz began functioning on a self-supporting basis, hence currently it only produces cabbage and potato.

YouNoodle matches entrepreneurs with competitions, accelerators, and startup programs, and provides a judging and voting SaaS platform to university, non-profit, government and enterprise clients organizing innovation challenges and competitions. Stanford's BASES, UC Berkeley LAUNCH, Start-Up Chile, Amazon Startup Challenge, and NASA are all running one or more competitions on YouNoodle's platform. History and structure YouNoodle was founded by Rebeca Hwang and Torsten Kolind in 2010. The company was spun off a project started by Bob Goodson and Kirill Makharinsky in 2007 with support from Peter Thiel (Founders Fund), Max Levchin (PayPal) and Charles Lho (Amicus Group), founding investor and Chairman of YouNoodle today. This project also spawned Quid (Goodson) and indirectly Ostrovok (Makharinsky). Although also named YouNoodle, this project/company was discontinued in 2010, when the three new entities started operations. The founders of the 2007-2010 entity were Goodson and Makharinsky, both former students of the University of Oxford. Goodson had studied medieval English literature before moving from Oxford to California when Levchin, the co- founder of PayPal, invited him to join a start-up there. Makharinsky's degree was in applied mathematics, and he was also encouraged to pursue opportunities in the United States by Levchin. Other significant employees included Hwang (co-founder of today's YouNoodle), a Stanford University doctoral student whose research is into social network theory. Startup predictor YouNoodle's now discontinued \\"Startup predictor\\", part of the 2007-2010 entity and developed by Makharinsky and Hwang, uses mathematical models to predict the success of new businesses. The user fills in a questionnaire, which takes about half an hour to complete and concentrates on the business' concept, finances, founders and advisers. Because the procedure is designed for very new companies, questions on revenue and traffic are not included. The site then provides an estimate of what the company's value will be after three years and a score from 1 to 1000 representing its value as an investment. The service is free for the startups themselves, but YouNoodle intends to charge third parties for access to the results. (The level of detail required by the questionnaire makes it difficult for people without inside knowledge of a company to provide the data for a prediction on their own.) The company's founders have declined to explain the algorithm in detail, but state that it takes into account the entrepreneurs' experience, networks and mutual relations. Information provided by companies which use the site's networking features is used to improve the algorithm. As of August 2008, the algorithm was based on data from 3,000 startups. In the same month the company had four patents pending on the technology.

Properties The inversive distance remains unchanged if the circles are inverted, or transformed by a M√∂bius transformation. One pair of circles can be transformed to another pair by a M√∂bius transformation if and only if both pairs have the same inversive distance. An analogue of the Beckman‚ÄìQuarles theorem holds true for the inversive distance: if a bijection of the set of circles in the inversive plane preserves the inversive distance between pairs of circles at some chosen fixed distance \\\\delta, then it must be a M√∂bius transformation that preserves all inversive distances.. Distance formula For two circles in the Euclidean plane with radii r and R, and distance d between their centers, the inversive distance can be defined by the formula. :I=\\\\frac{d^2-r^2-R^2}{2rR}. This formula gives: *a value greater than 1 for two disjoint circles, *a value of 1 for two circles that are tangent to each other and both outside each other, *a value between ‚àí1 and 1 for two circles that intersect, **a value of 0 for two circles that intersect each other at right angles , *a value of ‚àí1 for two circles that are tangent to each other, one inside of the other, *and a value less than ‚àí1 when one circle contains the other. (Some authors define the absolute inversive distance as the absolute value of the inversive distance.) Some authors modify this formula by taking the inverse hyperbolic cosine of the value given above, rather than the value itself. That is, rather than using the number I as the inversive distance, the distance is instead defined as the number \\\\delta obeying the equation :\\\\delta=\\\\operatorname{arcosh}( I). Although transforming the inversive distance in this way makes the distance formula more complicated, and prevents its application to crossing pairs of circles, it has the advantage that (like the usual distance for points on a line) the distance becomes additive for circles in a pencil of circles. That is, if three circles belong to a common pencil, then (using \\\\delta in place of I as the inversive distance) one of their three pairwise distances will be the sum of the other two.. In other geometries It is also possible to define the inversive distance for circles on a sphere, or for circles in the hyperbolic plane. Applications Steiner chains A Steiner chain for two disjoint circles is a finite cyclic sequence of additional circles, each of which is tangent to the two given circles and to its two neighbors in the chain. Steiner's porism states that if two circles have a Steiner chain, they have infinitely many such chains. The chain is allowed to wrap more than once around the two circles, and can be characterized by a rational number p whose numerator is the number of circles in the chain and whose denominator is the number of times it wraps around. All chains for the same two circles have the same value of p. If the inversive distance between the two circles (after taking the inverse hyperbolic cosine) is \\\\delta, then p can be found by the formula :p=\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{\\\\sin^{-1}\\\\tanh(\\\\delta/2)}. Conversely, every two disjoint circles for which this formula gives a rational number will support a Steiner chain. More generally, an arbitrary pair of disjoint circles can be approximated arbitrarily closely by pairs of circles that support Steiner chains whose p values are rational approximations to the value of this formula for the given two circles. Circle packings The inversive distance has been used to define the concept of an inversive-distance circle packing: a collection of circles such that a specified subset of pairs of circles (corresponding to the edges of a planar graph ) have a given inversive distance with respect to each other. This concept generalizes the circle packings described by the circle packing theorem, in which specified pairs of circles are tangent to each other.. Although less is known about the existence of inversive distance circle packings than for tangent circle packings, it is known that, when they exist, they can be uniquely specified (up to M√∂bius transformations) by a given maximal planar graph and set of Euclidean or hyperbolic inversive distances. This rigidity property can be generalized broadly, to Euclidean or hyperbolic metrics on triangulated manifolds with angular defects at their vertices.. However, for manifolds with spherical geometry, these packings are no longer unique.. In turn, inversive-distance circle packings have been used to construct approximations to conformal mappings.

It was formed in 1994 as the 45th Independent Spetsnaz Regiment, and expanded to a brigade in 2015. Creation It was created in 1994 from the 901st Air-Assault Battalion (created in 1979) and 218th Spetsnaz Battalion of the Russian Airborne Forces, (created in 1992). Colonel Pavel Popovskikh is credited with the creation of the 45th Spetsnaz as a ‚Äúsubunit of the future‚Äù designed for the type of counter-insurgency, warfare for which the forces had been so unprepared in Afghanistan. The regiment was composed of two special purpose battalions and is equipped with 15 BTR-80, and 1 BTR-D. The regiment composition is: *218th Battalion is based in Moscow-Sokolniki. *901st Battalion was formed on November 20, 1979. As of 2016, the unit was upgraded to a brigade and it's spetsnaz companies were tripled from six to eighteen, increasing the capability of the unit from two operational areas to three. The unit is part of the Russian Airborne Forces (VDV RF) and directly subordinated to VDV Headquarters. However it is also operationally subordinate to the GRU. History Old and unofficial patch of the 45th Regiment The brigade was formed on the basis of two battalions, each of which had a history of establishment and development. With an initial strength of 800 highly qualified personnel, the unit had especially powerful special reconnaissance capabilities and innovations to include unmanned surveillance aircraft and tailored psychological warfare assets. Almost all of its officers were ‚Äúprepared in the GRU spetsnaz system‚Äù. The 901st battalion was formed on November 20, 1979, on the territory of the Transcaucasian Military District, and was immediately transferred to Czechoslovakia, Central Group of Forces. In March 1989, in connection with the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Eastern Europe, the battalion was relocated to Aluksne, Latvian SSR and transferred to the Baltic Military District. In May 1991, the battalion was transferred to the Transcaucasian Military District and relocated in Sukhumi, Abkhaz ASSR. In August 1992, the battalion was transferred from the authority of the Transcaucasian military district under the authority of the staff of the airborne troops and renamed 901st Separate Airborne Battalion. As a separate battalion, it was transferred to the 7th Guards Airborne Division. War in Abkhazia (1992‚Äì93) In 1993, during the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, the battalion performed tasks for the protection and defense from looting and destruction of important military and Government facilities in the territory of Abkhazia. During this period, eight members of the battalion were killed, before the end of performing their military duty, and about 20 men were wounded. For combat missions thirteen men were awarded order \\"for personal courage\\", twenty one men-the Medal \\"for courage\\" and one man the Medal \\"for merit\\". In October 1993, the battalion was relocated from the city of Sukhumi to the Moscow region, where in February the following year it was transformed into the 901st Special Purpose Battalion. With the beginning of the formation of the Special Purpose Regiment, the battalion was included in its composition. The 218th Battalion of Special Forces Airborne Troops was formed July 25, 1992. By order of the Commander of the Airborne Troops in the historical continuity this day is considered to be the day of formation of this battalion. The battalion was involved as a peacekeeping force in the zones of inter-ethnic conflict in the Transdniester region in June and July 1992, in North Ossetia in September‚ÄìNovember, 1992 and in Abkhazia in December 1992. Many battalion members were awarded State Awards for bravery and heroism. Chechen Wars and North Caucasus insurgency Active use of this battalion in solving special tasks in various conflicts showed the need to build other special forces with similar tasks in the airborne troops and their integration in the regiment. By July 1994, the regiment was fully formed, staffed with personnel, equipment and proceeded to battle school. December 2, 1994, the regiment traveled to the Northern Caucasus to take part in the operations against rebel forces on the territory of the Chechen Republic.

The film has had three other titles: Jyothi Malar, Dasi Penn and Thumbai Mahatmyam, and Jothi Malar (). The film is based on a folk tale about a girl becoming a devadasi and dedicating her life to worshipping Lord Shiva and refusing to follow the traditional path of marrying a man. Dhaasippen performed well and became a box office hit. But no print of the film is known to survive, making it a lost film.  Plot  A young devadasi (R. Balasaraswathi) is forced by her family to yield to lustful zamindar (V. K. Dass). The devadasi refuses to do this because she is devoted to Lord Shiva (M. G. Ramachandran) and she wishes to marry her lover (T. R. Mahalingam). She encounters many hurdles on her journey. The zamindar attempts to kidnap her to make her his mistress. However, his attempts fail thanks to the intervention of Shiva and his consort, Parvathi (M. R. Santhanalakshmi). There is a parallel story in the film about her married sister (T. A. Madhuram) who carries on an affair with a travelling sari salesman (N. S. Krishnan). Her sister's illicit romance is always thwarted by the appearance of a fierce looking giant (Pulimooti Ramasamy). Eventually the devadasi grows tired of her life. Answering her prayers, Shiva transforms her into the thumbhai plant‚Äîthe flowers of which are offered to Lord Shiva during worship.

Bhanumathi and M. G. Ramachandran. The film was released on 22 July 1954, and was an astounding success and highest collection of the year. It ran more than 140 days in Chennai and all other major cities. It was the first Tamil film to win a President's Silver Medal.citwf.com, cast crew information It was the first Indian movie to be remade in five other languages. Plot Vijayapuri, a beautiful hillside hamlet appears serene and restful to a casual passerby. But the happenings there are far from tranquil. Dacoities, burglaries and even kidnappings seem to be commonplace occurrences. One established perpetrator of at least some of the crimes is Kaathavarayan, his secret accomplices being some well-known public figures like the rich young wastrel Veerarajan and the Kuttipatti Zamindar. The other dacoit is apparently the mysterious Malaikkallan. Legends are galore on his fabulous wealth, awe-inspiring exploits, contempt for the unprincipled rich, concern for the poor and needy indeed he seems to be running a veritable empire in some hidden hillock; no one has actually seen him. There is also the wealthy merchant Abdul Raheem, who seems to disappear at regular intervals from Vijayapuri, claiming business calls at far-off places. In this hotbed of intrigue and suspicion blooms an innocent rose Poonkothai, daughter of the upright Sokkesa Mudaliar. Veerarajan is the cousin of Poonkothai and desires to marry her, but his evil reputation ensures the impossibility of such an alliance. Having lost her mother at an early age, Poonkothai is brought up by her widowed aunt Kamakshi Ammal. Kamakshi Ammal's only son Kumaraveeran went missing many years back. Faced by stringent public criticism for their failure to tackle the audacious crimes, Sub-Inspector Arumugam arrives in Vijayapuram. But his assistant Constable Karuppiah is a bungling coward and is more a hindrance than a help in his investigations. It is at this juncture that one night when Mudaliar is away, Poonkothai is kidnapped. The happenings of that eerie night keep the village tongues wagging for many days thereafter. Two sidekicks of Kathavarayan are found tied and hanging upside down, and a piece of Poonkothai's jewellery is recovered from them. Kamakshi Ammal is found tied-up and unconscious, and a mysterious errand-boy hands over to the attending doctor a forest herb that revives her at once. Poonkothai is said to be in the custody of Malaikkallan, who has cleverly waylaid Kathavarayan's men and taken away Poonkothai. Kathavarayan faces the ire and ridicule of Veerarajan at the behest of whom he had engineered Poonkothai's kidnapping. Goaded by this humiliation, he now sends his men far and wide in search of Poonkothai. Meanwhile, Poonkothai is safe in the magnificent hideout of Malaikkallan, perceiving his genuine concern for the downtrodden and the reverence with which he is held by his people, her contempt and mistrust turn gradually into admiration and leads to love. Several confounding twists and turns later the truant pieces of the puzzle fall in place. Kathavarayan and Veerarajan get their well-deserved comeuppance. Malaikkallan and Abdul Raheem both turn out to be the same person who is the long missing Kumaraveeran. All is well that ends with the happy marriage of Poonkothai and Kumaraveeran.

Ramalingam Pillai (Namakkal Kavignar). Malaikkallan had been prescribed as the non-detailed text for the high school curriculum in the early 50s, and the story had become very popular. Tamil filmmaker A. P. Nagarajan was cast as a police inspector wearing a turban and all. However, after shooting some scenes with him, Naidu for some reason chose to replace him with M. G. Chakrapani. Soundtrack S. M. Subbiah Naidu scored the music, while the lyrics were penned by Namakkal Kavignar Ve. Ramalingam Pillai, Ku. Ma. Balasubramaniam, Thanjai N. Ramaiah Dass and Makkalanban. Playback singers are P. A. Periyanayaki and T. M. Soundararajan The song Eththanai Kaalam Thaan Yemaatruvaar became so popular that MGR then decided to insert at least one such philosophical song in his future projects. It was the first song that T. M. Soundararajan had sung for M. G. Ramachandran, after the success he sang many songs for him. The song was remixed by Leon James for the film LKG (2019).https://www.cinemaexpress.com/stories/news/2019/jan/25/lkg-first- single-rj-balaji-leon-james-9787.html Release The film was released on 22 July 1954 with length of 5175 metres and with run time of 186 minutes. It emerged as the top grosser of the year. Tamil magazine Ananda Vikatan in its review dated 12 September 1954 mentioned that film \\"has several amazing moments which increase the heartbeats of the audience... Various fight scenes, dances and comedy scenes make the film a mass entertainer\\". The Indian Express wrote \\"Obviously with an eye on the box office the picture has been plentifully interspersed with fist and sword fights and fencing displays, etc\\". Remakes S. M. Sriramulu Naidu of Pakshiraja Studio in Coimbatore secured the rights to the story and decided to produce and direct a movie based on it, in 5 languages apart from the original version- Tamil (Malaikkallan with MGR), Telugu (Aggiramudu with N. T. Rama Rao), Malayalam (Thaskaraveeran with Sathyan), Kannada (Bettada Kalla with Kalyan Kumar) and Hindi (Azaad with Dilip Kumar) and Sinhalese (Surasena). Except Azaad that had music by C. Ramchandra, S. M. Subbaiah Naidu composed music for the movie in all the other languages. Legacy The film created the trend of the concept of \\"Robin Hood\\" and inspired various films like Neelamalai Thirudan (1957), Malaiyoor Mambattiyan (1983), Gentleman (1993) and Sivaji (2007). The film also created the trend of philosophical songs and introduction songs for the lead actors.

R. Sundaram under his production banner Modern Theatres. The film stars M. G. Ramachandran and P. Bhanumathi, with K. Sarangapani, P. S. Veerappa, K. A. Thangavelu, M. N. Rajam, Sushila, Vidhyavathi, and M. G. Chakrapani in supporting roles. The film tells the story of Alibaba, a poor woodcutter, who becomes wealthy after finding a secret cave which contains various treasures and antiques. He resolves to keep his source of wealth a secret to lead a peaceful life. Whether he keeps it a secret and protects the treasure from falling into the wrong hands forms the rest of the story. Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum was shot in Gevacolor and is notable for being the first Tamil and South Indian full-length colour film. It is based on the story Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves from One Thousand and One Nights. It is also the second Tamil film adaptation of that story, after the 1941 film of the same name. Filming took place mainly at Mysore and Yercaud. The soundtrack was composed by Susarla Dakshinamurthi, and re-used many songs from the 1954 Hindi film Alibaba Aur 40 Chor. It was also the final film of Ramachandran's three-film contract with Modern Theatres. Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum was released on 14 January 1956 during the festive occasion of Pongal. It was a milestone in Ramachandran's career and became a success at the box office which was largely attributed to it being the first full-length colour film in South India. The songs also attained popularity. The film was later dubbed in Telugu as Ali Baba 40 Dongalu.  Plot  Marziana, a Baghdad-based dancer, is abducted by the tyrant Sher Khan, commander of the notorious king Amir Kasim Khan, to his palace. She is rescued by Alibaba, an impoverished woodcutter who fights with Sher Khan and vanquishes him. Marziana and her sidekick Dowlath find refuge in Alibaba's house who lives with his sister Ayisha and servant Bulbul. Marziana learns that they are the siblings of Kasim, who had driven them out at the instigation of his cruel wife Salima. Marziana and Alibaba later fall in love. When Alibaba goes to cut wood, he chances upon the cavernous hideout of Abu Hussain, the leader of forty dacoits, and overhears the secret code to enter and exit the cave. After the dacoits leave, Alibaba uses the code word, enters the hideout, and takes some of the cave's wealth which he uses to help poor people nearby. Both Alibaba and Marziana become wealthy overnight. Kasim becomes jealous when he hears about his brother's fortune, and wants to know the secret behind this. Under Salima's guidance, he invites Alibaba and his household for a feast. After cunningly obtaining the secret of the dacoits' cave, Kasim sentences Alibaba to death, falsely accusing him of attempted murder. Marziana pretends to heed Kasim's order. She declares that Alibaba has been unfaithful to her and he deserves this retribution. Taking a knife, Marziana acts as though she means to kill Alibaba, but instead cuts the ropes that bind his hands. A fight ensues between Alibaba and Kasim's thugs, during which Salima is accidentally killed, but Alibaba subdues them and escapes with his allies. Kasim enters the cave and greedily starts collecting many treasures. He soon forgets the code word, and is left trapped. The dacoits arrive and kill him for entering their secret cave. Alibaba later visits the cave and is shocked to see his brother dead; he takes away the corpse. After Kasim's death is announced publicly, Alibaba is declared the new king of Baghdad and everyone rejoices. Meanwhile, the dacoits return to their cave and find that Kasim's corpse is missing. Realising that someone else has entered their cave, they start searching for the mystery person. From the cobbler Gulam's assertion that the woodcutter Alibaba had become wealthy overnight, Abu Hussain realises that it is Alibaba who discovered the secret of his cave, but kills the cobbler afterwards. He then plans to kill Alibaba. Having his men hide inside barrels, Abu Hussain comes to Alibaba's house disguised as an oil merchant seeking shelter for the night. However, Marziana overhears him whispering to his men, and realises his true identity. While she dances at a banquet Alibaba hosts in honour of the guest, Dowlath and Bulbul roll the barrels one by one into the swirling waters as per the plan. After Marziana tries unsuccessfully to stab the \\"oil merchant\\", she exposes him as Abu Hussain; Alibaba is shocked. This leads to a fight between the two men, which results in Abu Hussain kidnapping Marziana and fleeing to the cave. Alibaba chases him and reaches the cave where he kills Abu Hussain after an intense battle. After Alibaba rescues Marziana, they marry and continue to perform social work.  Cast  ; Male actors * M.

The film's story is credited to the Modern Theatres' Story Department. Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum became the second major Tamil film adaptation of the story of Ali Baba; the first was the 1941 film of the same name, starring N. S. Krishnan. While that version was a comedy, this one was more action-oriented. In addition to producing, Modern Theatres founder T. R. Sundaram also directed the film. A. J. Dominic was signed as the film's art director, while W. R. Subba Rao, L. Balu, and Murasoli Maran were in charge of the cinematography, editing, and dialogues respectively. A.K.Chopra and K.N.Dhandayudhapani Pillai were in charge of the choreography.  Casting  M. G. Ramachandran was cast as Alibaba, this being the final film of his three-film contract with Modern Theatres, following Manthiri Kumari (1950) and Sarvadhikari (1951). He was paid for acting in the film. The screenplay was written in a way that would suit his then \\"swashbucking\\" image, as opposed to the original story where the character was a \\"gullible simpleton\\". P. S. Veerappa was cast as Abu Hussain, the leader of the forty thieves. Padmini was initially given the role of the female lead Marziana, but she was replaced subsequently by P. Bhanumathi. Bhanumathi liked the film, one of her earliest in Tamil, because she found the character a \\"go-getter\\". In her autobiography, Bhanumathi noted that after she heard the story, she considered her role to be much better than that in Missamma (1955), from which she was fired after filming only four reels, adding that after she accepted to work on this film, she got more acting offers from Tamil film producers. Ramachandran's elder brother M. G. Chakrapani was cast in the role of Alibaba's elder brother Kassim. K. Sarangapani was cast as Marziana's sidekick Dowlath, K. A. Thangavelu as the cobbler Gulam, M. N. Rajam as Alibaba's servant Bulbul, Vidhyavathi (the screen name of Jayalalithaa's aunt, Ambujavalli) as Kassim's wife Salima, and P. Sushila as Alibaba's sister Ayisha. Boopathi Nandaram, O. A. K. Thevar and K. K. Soundar played Sher Khan, Hameed and Abdullah respectively. Waheeda Rehman, who later became a leading actress in Hindi cinema, appeared as a dancer in the number \\"Salaam Babu\\", while the dancer duo Sayee‚ÄìSubbulakshmi appeared in the song \\"Naama Aaduvadhum\\".  Filming  Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum was shot entirely on indoor sets, with the exception of a few horse riding sequences. For changes of scenes, irises and wipes were used which, according to Encyclopaedia of Indian Cinema by Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen, added a \\"sense of anachronism\\" to the film. It was also the first full-length Tamil colour film, shot in Gevacolor. Rajadhyaksha and Willemen claim it to be the first South Indian film in Gevacolor, despite the fact that the 1955 Tamil film Kanavaney Kankanda Deivam had a few sequences in Gevacolor. The scenes involving horses, which belonged to the Mysore Reserve Police, were shot at Mysore over ten days. The thieves' cave, designed by Dominic, was created at two locations ‚Äì the exterior cave scenes with the horses were shot at Mysore, while the interior scenes were shot at Yercaud near Salem. Sundaram brought twenty horses from Mysore for the shoot at Yercaud. The jewels and gold coins featured in the film were actually clay painted in gold. One of the horses rode by Ramachandran was Sundaram's own. In one particular scene, Ramachandran objected to the dialogue where he had to swear in the name of Allah, as he was then associated with the rationalist Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. He suggested that the dialogue be changed to swearing in the name of his mother, but was finally asked by the director to use the original dialogue. When only a song and a fight sequence were left to be finished, Ramachandran could not appear for the shoot, since he had another film to shoot for. As Sundaram was unwilling to wait for Ramachandran's return, those portions were eventually shot with Karadimuthu, who acted as a body double for Ramachandran. Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum was processed at the Film Centre, Bombay (now Mumbai). The final length of the film was .  Themes and influences  Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum is based on the story of Ali Baba from One Thousand and One Nights. Although the tale and costumes are middle eastern, Marziana, a Muslim, often refers to Yama, the Hindu god of death. Sri Lankan historian Sachi Sri Kantha noted that various Ramachandran films reflect the 1950s trend of films being \\"costume dramas\\" that focus on princes and folk heroes, citing Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum as an example. Ramachandran was an avid fan of action heroes like Errol Flynn, John Barrymore, and Douglas Fairbanks. Throughout the 1950s, he acted in films that justified his status as an action hero. Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum portrayed him as a swashbuckling action hero who also has a Robin Hood-like agenda of serving the poor and the downtrodden with the treasure he finds in the cave. Udhav Naig of The Hindu noted that through Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum and several other films, Ramachandran \\"posited a cleverly-crafted image of being one among the working classes and poorer sections, raising a fist against injustice.\\" Rajadhyaksha and Willemen, in Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema, compare it to Ramachandran's other films like Malaikkallan (1954) and Madurai Veeran (1956) as they are also Robin Hood-inspired, and because Bhanumathi plays a damsel in distress in them. The French website Jol-Press compared it to Manthiri Kumari because both films feature Ramachandran as a Flynn-inspired hero.  Music  The film's original soundtrack and score were composed by Susarla Dakshinamurthi, while the lyrics were written by A. Maruthakasi. T. R. Sundaram decided to use the same tunes set from the Hindi film Alibaba Aur 40 Chor (1954). Udumalai Narayana Kavi was offered to write the lyrics. He declined, saying that he would only write lyrics for fresh tunes and recommended Maruthakasi, who was finalised. The song \\"Azhagaana Ponnu Naan\\" is based on \\"Dekho Ji Shanti Nikla\\", \\"Masila Unmai Kathale\\" is based on \\"Ae Saba Unse Kah Jara\\" \\"Chinnanjiru Chitte\\" is based on \\"Chalo Chalo Chale Hum Babul Ke Tale\\", and \\"En Aattamellaam\\" is based on \\"Sharmake Lajake\\"; all from Alibaba Aur 40 Chor. The dilruba in the songs were played by Shanmugham. \\"Azhagaana Ponnu Naan\\" is set in the Mayamalavagowla raga. The opening line of \\"Azhagaana Ponnu Naan\\" was later used in a song titled \\"Azhagana Ponnu Thaan\\" from Nenjirukkum Varai (2006). \\"Ullasa Ulagam\\" was later remixed by Pravin Mani and Vidyasagar in Jayamkondaan (2008). \\"Chinnanchiru Chitte\\" was remixed in Muruga (2007). Elements from the song were also used in \\"Andangkaka\\" from Anniyan (2005). The songs received positive reviews with \\"Azhagaana Ponnu Naan\\", \\"Masila Unmai Kathale\\", and \\"Ullaasa Ulagam\\" becoming popular among the masses.  Release  Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum was released on 14 January 1956, during the festive occasion of Pongal. Historian V. Sriram believes it was the first Tamil film to take advantage of block colour advertising. The film was a commercial success and ran for over 100 days in theatres. It became a \\"landmark\\" in Ramachandran's acting career, and set a \\"precedent for many buccaneer-style characters\\" he would portray in his later films. The film won the Film Fans' Association award for Best Tamil film. It was later dubbed in Telugu as Ali Baba 40 Dongalu. Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum had a limited re- release on 14 April 2011, during the festive occasion of Puthandu (Tamil New Year) in Chennai.  Reception  Tamil film historian S. Theodore Baskaran wrote in his 1996 book The Eye of the Serpent, \\"The film's cast of M.G. Ramachandran as the swash-buckling Alibaba, Bhanumathi as the singing-heroine ... and Thangavelu as the comedian was the main factor contributing to its huge success.\\" He also praised the performance of P. S. Veerappa, and said that another factor attributed to the film's success that it was the first full-length South Indian colour film. In Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema, Rajadhyaksha and Willemen said the film was remembered \\"mainly for MGR's swashbuckling stunts (it is one of the star's most characteristic 50s genre films), the elaborate group dances and Bhanumathi's very popular song-and- dance routines.\\" Following Bhanumathi's death in 2005, S. R. Ashok Kumar of The Hindu wrote that the film showcased one of her \\"best known performances.\\" Dancer and writer Lakshmi Viswanathan, who saw the film during its original release in 1956 at the Chennai-based Chitra theatre, wrote for The Hindu 2012, \\"We children could not contain our excitement when the first colour film in Tamil ... was released in Chitra. We saw it again and again with the thrill that only children of those days could experience.\\" Sachi Sri Kantha felt that the Gevacolor looked somewhat \\"washed out\\" and \\"inferior\\" to other colouring processes like Eastmancolor and versions of Fujicolor. He said the film succeeded with the Tamil masses because \\"it was a first time experience they could enjoy the [colour] in totality. This is because illiterate Tamil masses would have watched Hollywood movies produced in [colour] for entertainment. But, being illiterate, [the] majority wouldn't have comprehended the dialogues and songs in English.\\" In 2015, Karan Bali wrote for Scroll.in that the film \\"blended melodious songs, exciting fighting scenes and a suspenseful climax\\", and praised Veerappa's performance as Abu Hussain. On Ramachandran's centenary in January 2017, Nivedita Mishra of Hindustan Times included his performance in Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum in her list compiling \\"some of his most memorable performances\\".  Home media  Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum was released on home video by Moser Baer in June 2010, and by Raj Video Vision in April 2012.  Legacy  Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum has been referenced in many films. Janagaraj's character in Rajadhi Raja (1989) sings a portion of \\"Ullasa Ulagam\\", before meeting with a fate similar to that of Thangavelu's character in Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum. Goundamani and Sathyaraj's characters imitate the song \\"Maasila Unmai Kadhale\\" in Rickshaw Mama (1992). Vellaisamy (Vadivelu) and Pazhanisamy (Vivek) sing the beginning portion of \\"Ullasa Ulagam\\" in Pongalo Pongal (1997). In Baba (2002), the title character (Rajinikanth) and his friends see the clip where Alibaba closes the cave using the phrase \\"close sesame\\" after entering it using the words \\"open sesame\\". Actor Narayan Lucky has stated that his 2015 film Thiranthidu Seese was named after the dialogue of the same name spoken by Ramachandran in Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum. In Thoppi (2015), the Minister for Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments orders police inspector Kuzhanthaisamy to find a stolen film reel box; the film is Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum.

It was a commercial success, grossing 11 million in its lifetime, thereby becoming only the second Tamil film to earn 10 million after another Ramachandran starrer Madurai Veeran (1956); it became a silver jubilee film. Nadodi Mannan acquired cult status in Tamil cinema, and became a turning point for Ramachandran in terms of both his acting and political career. It was dubbed into Telugu as Anaganaga Oka Raju and in Hindi as Hamen Bhi Jeene Do.  Plot  The kingdom of Ratnapuri is besieged by food shortages and high unemployment. Since the king‚Äôs only daughter Ratna is missing and the king dies without naming a successor, Marthandan, a member of the royal family, is chosen by a majority of the imperial council of Ratnapuri to be its new ruler. However, the kingdom's Rajaguru (high priest) Vijayavarman, plans to kill Marthandan and make Pingalan, Marthandan's cousin, king. Meanwhile, Veerabahu, a loyal bodyguard of the late king, and his men, including his son Bhupathi and daughter Madhana, are not pleased to see Marthandan as king and are equally saddened by the situation of Ratnapuri's people. Violent protests erupt all over the kingdom led by Veerangan, Marthandan's look-alike, with the support of his friend Sagayam. The protestors march to the palace condemning the monarchy and demanding democracy. Veerangan is imprisoned for his actions in Naganathapuram, a nearby town. Madhana is also incarcerated in the same prison on a similar charge. They are pardoned and released on the occasion of Marthandan's coronation. They travel together to Ratnapuri. Sharing the same ideals and revolutionary thoughts, they fall in love. In the meantime, Marthandan arrives at Ratnapuri. Vijayavarman asks him to stay in an isolated palace on the outskirts and tells him that he should not meet his wife Manohari until the coronation, as the current moment is inauspicious. On entering a hotel in Ratnapuri, Veerangan and Sagayam beat up a gang of rowdies. Hired by Vijayavarman, they mistake Veerangan for Marthandan. Veerangan is chased by palace guards and ends up in Marthandan's room. Marthandan and Veerangan meet face to face. Veerangan tells him of the pathetic state the people of Ratnapuri, and Marthandan agrees to set everything right as soon as he takes charge. On the eve of the coronation, Vijayavarman arranges for Marthandan to be poisoned. He carries out his plan with the help of Karmegam, a royal advisor. Marthandan swoons after drinking a few sips of the poisoned beverage, but is soon saved by Veerangan and Ratnapuri's commander-in-chief. However, Marthandan is still unconscious and incapacitated. The commander-in-chief, and one of the ministers, persuade Veerangan to take Marthandan's place to ensure that the coronation takes place as scheduled. A reluctant Veerangan agrees to do so in the interests of the state, and arrives just in time for the coronation. It takes place smoothly and Veerangan, as Marthandan, becomes Ratnapuri's new king. Vijayavarman and Pingalan are taken aback and send men to investigate. They find the unconscious Marthandan and kidnap him. Veerangan now finds himself saddled with the role of king for more days than he had initially bargained for because of Marthandan's sudden disappearance. He does not let this setback deter him and puts the opportunity to good use by beginning many reforms, and enacting several measures to uplift the poor. These steps are supported by the people while causing a political upheaval among the elite. However, he is troubled by the fact that he is deceiving Manohari who believes him to be Marthandan. Unable to keep it a secret from her, he tells her the truth. Perceiving his noble character, Manohari accepts him as her brother. Madhana is killed by Pingalan's men, and a grief-stricken Veerangan vows to avenge her death. He discovers through Veerabahu that both Marthandan and Ratna have been kidnapped and held in custody on an island named Kanni Theevu. Veerangan sails to Kanni Theevu and comes across Ratna, who falls in love with him; he reciprocates her feelings. Pingalan and Karmegam arrive there only to find that the island's chieftain is none other than Vijayavarman, who has kidnapped Ratna after she was born. Vijayavarman plans to marry Ratna himself, get rid of Pingalan, and declare himself the ruler of Ratnapuri. Pingalan decides to take Ratna back and make himself king legally by marrying her. Ratna does not approve of it. Pingalan takes her away by force. Veerangan saves her from Pingalan's clutches. The duo then free Marthandan and Karmegam, who had been captured by Vijayavarman and is now reformed. Both Marthandan and Veerangan defeat Vijayavarman. Veerangan marries Ratna, and Marthandan issues a proclamation stating that Ratnapuri is a democracy.  Cast  ;Male actors *M. G. Ramachandran as Marthandan and Veerangan *P. S.

Chakrapani, who were its co-producers and shareholders, were keen to make a film under their own production banner. Hence, they established Em.Gee.Yar Productions and hired M. Karunanidhi to draft a script for their company's debut film titled Vidivelli. The film was shelved after Karunanidhi was imprisoned for participating in the Kallakudi demonstration in July 1953. Ramachandran and Chakrapani then dissolved Em.Gee.Yar Productions and established the Em.Gee.Yar drama troupe instead, but the idea of producing a film was still on Ramachandran's mind. Ramachandran had dreamt of making his own film ever since he attended a screening of Frank Lloyd's historical drama, If I Were King (1938) starring Ronald Colman, in Calcutta. This occurred while he was playing a minor role in Maya Machhindra (1939). He wished to make a film that would express his political views and interests to the people of Tamil Nadu. To this end, he assembled a team of three people: R. M. Veerappan, V. Lakshmanan and S. K. T. Sami. He gave them suggestions about the outline of the story and urged them to watch If I Were King and two other films: The Prisoner of Zenda (1937), another Colman film, and Elia Kazan's Viva Zapata! (1952). After several brainstorming sessions, the team came up with a story loosely based on the three films and decided on the title Nadodi Mannan. The trio then helped make it look more Indian. Nadodi Mannan was produced on a budget of 1.8 million, which was considered approximately two-and-a-half times more expensive than the average Tamil film made at the time. Nearly a year was spent on pre- production and casting. K. Ramnoth was appointed initially to direct the film, but died before production began resulting in Ramachandran taking over the position himself, thereby making his directorial debut. This was the second film produced by Ramachandran, and the first under the production banner of Em.Gee.Yar Pictures, which was handled by Ramachandran, Chakrapani and Veerappan. Kannadasan and Ravindar, who assisted Veerappan, Lakshmanan and Sami with the story, wrote the dialogues. The screenplay was written by the trio of C. Kuppusami, K. Srinivasan and P. Neelakantan. G. K. Ramu, K. Nageswar Rao and R. N. Nagaraja Rao were in charge of cinematography, art direction and stills. K. P. Ramakrishnan and Arunachalam acted as stunt doubles for Ramachandran. Film historian Film News Anandan noticed publicity stills of Nadodi Mannan on Veerappan's office desk when he happened to visit the office of Em.Gee.Yar Pictures. He then offered to distribute them to the press. Veerappan agreed knowing that Anandan was then a member of the South Indian Film Journalists Association. After a few days, stills of the film were published in many magazines. Ramachandran was impressed with Anandan's work and, at Veerappan's suggestion, hired him as the film's public relations officer (PRO). This was Anandan's debut film as a PRO; however, his name does not appear in the opening credits.  Casting  During the filming of Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum (1956), an advertisement for Nadodi Mannan was released describing it as an adaptation of The Prisoner of Zenda. Two days later, Bharani Pictures, the production company co-founded by P. S. Ramakrishna Rao and P. Bhanumathi, released an advertisement for a film whose concept was similar to The Prisoner of Zenda. When Ramachandran and Bhanumathi heard their films were similar, they tried to convince each other to change their film's storyline. After much deliberation, Ramachandran told Bhanumathi that he was keeping \\"only the section of a commoner switched to king\\" in the original, while the rest of the film would be different. Ramachandran accepted that they were both confused over what to do next. A few days later, for unknown reasons, Bharani Pictures' planned film was shelved. Bhanumathi informed Ramachandran and told him he could go ahead with his film. She offered Ramachandran her shelved film's script, written by A. K. Velan, and asked him to use it for Nadodi Mannan. Ramachandran thanked her for her generosity, and offered her the role of Madhana; Bhanumathi agreed. M. N. Rajam was cast as Manohari, the queen of Ratnapuri, and king Marthandan's wife. Ramachandran wanted Rajam for the role to avoid her being typecast as a character driven by jealousy and malice. For the role of Ratna, B. Saroja Devi was selected after a successful audition. Saroja Devi was not fluent in Tamil at the time, so her dialogues were written in such a way that she would find it easier to pronounce them. P. S. Veerappa, M. N. Nambiar and Chakrapani played the antagonists Vijayavarman, Pingalan and Karmegam. T. K. Balachandran, who was prominent in Malayalam films, was cast as Bhupathi. K. R. Ramsingh was selected for the role of Madhana and Bhupathi's father, Veerabahu, after Ramachandran was impressed by his performance in one of the stage plays he featured in. Chandrababu played Veerangan's friend and sidekick, Sagayam. T. P. Muthulakshmi was cast as Nagamma, a native of Kanni Theevu, who wants a husband. G. Sakunthala played Manohari's lady-in-waiting Nandini and K. S. Angamuthu the restaurateur Pappa respectively.  Filming  Nadodi Mannan was filmed in black-and-white for the sequences in Ratnapuri, and in Gevacolor for the later scenes depicting the happenings on Kanni Theevu. The film's colour sections were processed at the Film Centre laboratory in Bombay. Principal photography took place from 1956 to 1957 over a period of 156 days, which was more than the usual amount of time taken for shooting as most films in that period were completed in 40‚Äì50 days. The song \\"Sammadhama\\" was the first sequence to be shot. The underwater sequence for the song \\"Kannil Vanthu Minnalpol\\", the dance scenes for the song \\"Maanaithedi Machchaan\\", and \\"Thoongathey Thambi Thoongathey\\" took 12, 9 and 3 days each to shoot. The climax portions involving Ramachandran, Saroja Devi and Veerappa required 11 days of filming, while the sword fights between of Ramachandran and Nambiar were shot in a week. As director, Ramachandran wanted the end result to be perfect and shot multiple retakes for the same scene. Bhanumathi found his perfectionist directorial style demanding as she was used to finishing her scenes in a single take. She complained about the same, opining that Ramachandran should leave the job of directing the film to someone else instead, only then would she provide her commitment without charging any additional cost. Ramachandran asked her to either do the role as he preferred or leave the project. Bhanumathi left, and her remaining scenes were altered by having her character, Madhana, die. Since Ramachandran shot retakes, a lot of film was wasted. At the time, film studios allowed the use of only a small number of film rolls to avoid budgetary concerns. Ramachandran bought from outside sources for 500, which was considered expensive. As a result of these various problems during the project's production, it was dubbed as Komali Mannan (\\"Jester King\\") by the magazine Dina Thanthi. During filming, Ramachandran received support from various members of the Tamil cinema industry. B. Nagi Reddy allowed Ramachandran to build the sets for Nadodi Mannan at Vijaya Vauhini Studios. Likewise, S. S. Vasan of Gemini Studios volunteered his equipment to ensure that the climax scenes came out well; it was the only time the studio's equipment was used outside its premises. The outdoor sequences were shot in collaboration with Aruna Films. Ramachandran asked director K. Subramanyam to participate in the filmmaking as an overseer. Subramanyam was impressed with Ramachandran's approach and felt there was no need for anyone to supervise him. Subrahmanyam also helped make arrangements for filming some outdoor shots at Munnar. These were done in collaboration with Aruna Films. Aarumugam handled the editing initially, but left during the beginning of the film's principal photography; he was later replaced by K. Perumal. C. P. Jambulingam took responsibility for editing the film's colour portions after Perumal suddenly fell ill. The final length of Nadodi Mannan was .  Themes  Nadodi Mannan was inspired by films such as The Prisoner of Zenda, If I Were King and Viva Zapata!. Ramachandran, in an account about the film he wrote in 1959, mentioned three specific differences from The Prisoner of Zenda. In the original, the look-alike and the queen have an intimate relationship while in Nadodi Mannan, Veerangan rejects Manohari's advances. When she realises that Veerangan is not Marthandan, she addresses him as her brother instead. Secondly, the look-alike was related to the king and shared the same interests. Veerangan is not related to Marthandan and initially has contrasting traits until they meet. Thirdly, the character of Vijayavarman, and the sequences in Kanni Theevu, do not feature in the original, while these were incorporated as part of Nadodi Mannans main plot. Sri Lankan film historian Sachi Sri Kantha noted that several of Ramachandran's films reflect the 1950s trend of films being \\"costume dramas\\" that focus on princes and folk heroes, citing Nadodi Mannan as an example. Kantha points out that the protagonist featured in a \\"riding scene with an educational (or philosophical) song\\" with \\"either the heroine or a side-kick (comedian) or an actor in a minor role\\" alongside him is a recurring theme in many films starring Ramachandran. According to Kantha, this was after the song \\"Ethanai Kaalam Thaan Ematruvar Indha Naatinile\\" from Malaikkallan (1954) became popular. In Nadodi Mannan, the song \\"Summa Kedandha\\" which features Ramachandran alongside Bhanumathi, and \\"Uzhaipa Thilla\\" which features an extra, were described by Kantha as \\"educational songs with a riding scene\\". R. Ilangovan of Frontline magazine believed the lyrics for \\"Summa Kedandha\\", which were written by Pattukkottai Kalyanasundaram who was a member of the Communist Party of India, \\"are a classic example of how he presented forcefully the idea of radical reforms\\". Ilangovan mentions the presentation of reforms by Kalyanasundaram in the song is indicated by two lines: \\"Kadu velanchenna machan, namakku kaiyum, kalum thane mitcham\\" (What if the fields are lush with crops, we are left with mere hands and legs) reflects a pessimistic tone, while ‚ÄúKadu vilayttum ponnae, namakku kalam irukkuthu pennae‚Äù (Let the fields sprout, young lady, our time will come), presents an optimistic feel. Nadodi Mannan is considered by many critics, historians and intellectuals to be a propaganda film of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) as Ramachandran was affiliated with the party at that time. Film historians Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen, Vaasanthi, S. Rajanayagam and politician S. Jagathrakshakan note that the black and red flag of the DMK, as well as the party's rising sun symbol, are seen in the film. Rajadhyaksha and Willemen further state that Vijayavarman's corrupt nature is \\"a thinly disguised reference to the Congress Party\\". Both Vaasanthi and another film historian, Selvaraj Velayutham, mention a scene where Ramachandran issues a decree that can be passed off as \\"a DMK election manifesto\\". According to both Erik Barnouw and Sisir Kumar Das, the song \\"Senthamizhe\\" represents the glorification of the Tamil language, identity and culture. It also symbolises what Das describes as \\"a medium of propagation of D.M.K. ideology\\". Of the same song, Ramachandran's biographer R. Kannan found it to be a continuation of including songs with political messages in films beginning with Malaikkallan. Ramachandran even went on to say, during the celebration of the film's 100th day theatrical run, that: \\"Nadodi Mannan has been produced to show that the DMK is the party which is serving the people of this country.\\"  Music  N. S. Balakrishnan composed the songs \\"Paadupattathannale\\", \\"Sammadhama\\" and \\"Senthamizhe\\" while the rest were by S. M. Subbaiah Naidu, who was also in charge of the background score. The songs' lyrics were written by Pattukkottai Kalyanasundaram, Suratha, Kavi Lakshmanadas, N. M. Muthukkoothan and M. K. Aathmanathan. The song \\"Varuga Varuga Vendhe\\", written by Suratha, was also composed in Kannada, Malayalam and in Telugu with lyrics by Vijaya Narasimha, P. Bhaskaran, and Narayanababu respectively. The track \\"Summa Kedandha\\" was written earlier for the news agency Janasakthi before Kalyansundaram used it for the film with a few minor changes in the lyrics. The songs were recorded on 45 RPM records produced by The Gramophone Company of India Ltd label, which also released the soundtrack. Plans for the inclusion of another track, \\"Kaalai Maatai Paal Karaga Paarkiraanga\\", were dropped since a pair of bullocks were used as the symbol of the Congress Party at that time. The soundtrack received positive feedback with songs like \\"Thoongathey Thambi Thoongathey,\\" \\"Thadukkathey\\", \\"Summa Kedandha\\" and \\"Senthamizhe\\" becoming popular hits. Sachi Sri Kantha called \\"Thoongathey Thambi Thoongathey\\" a \\"magical educational song,\\" further describing it as one of the songs that Ramachandran used to direct \\"his attention on the listlessness among Tamil workers\\". Rajadhyaksha and Willemen mention in their book, Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema, that \\"Thoongathey Thambi Thoongathey\\" had inaugurated \\"MGR's personal political programme\\". Both Sridhar Swaminathan of Hindu Tamil Thisai and Maayan of the Tamil magazine Ananda Vikatan also cite the same song as a good example of children's education. A reviewer from The New Indian Express called the songs \\"philosophy-espousing\\" while noting how they \\"spelt the Dravidian tenets\\".  Release  Nadodi Mannan was released on 22 August 1958. The expenses made for the film resulted in Ramachandran not having enough money to buy release prints. Hence, Veerappan and Chakrapani decided to acquire a legal loan of 50,000 from AVM Productions. However, Ramachandran's signature was required for the loan contract. When they consulted with him on this issue, he asked Veerappan and Chakrapani to tell the studio's founder A. V. Meiyappan that they would repay the loan and keep the price paid by the production company, Cinemas Limited, for distribution rights for the film's release in Sri Lanka as collateral. Meiyappan agreed to provide the loan, which was repaid by Veerappan immediately after the film's release.  Reception   Critical reception  The film received positive critical response. A review carried by Ananda Vikatan dated 7 September 1958, appreciated the film for being a commercial entertainer, describing it as a treat to the eyes. The review concluded that the film could be seen more than once. K. Jeshi from The Hindu appreciated the filmmaking techniques used to portray Ramachandran's dual roles, noting that it was \\"technically superior\\". A reviewer from the entertainment and news website Sify called it \\"a pucca mass entertainer\\". Rajadhyaksha and Willemen mention that Nadodi Mannan was made \\"in a style derived from Gemini's post-Chandralekha (1948) films\\". James K. Norton, author of the book Global Studies, India and South Asia, called the film \\"a prime example of how rhetoric and action were combined to build an image as a hero of the oppressed\\". Rajanayagam however, criticised Ramachandran's role as Marthandan, pointing out that the character's mannerisms are \\"overdone to the point of annoyance\\".  Box office  Shortly before its release, Ramachandran's take on the film's fate was: \\"I am a king if this were to succeed. If not, I will be a vagabond.\\" The film turned out to be an unprecedented success at the box office, grossing 11 million, becoming only the second Tamil film to earn more than 10 million after Madurai Veeran (1956), which also featured Ramachandran in the lead. The film ran for 100 days in 23 theatres worldwide. It went on to achieve a theatrical run of 175 days and become a silver jubilee film. It was dubbed into Telugu as Anaganaga Oka Raju and as Hamen Bhi Jeene Do in Hindi. The DMK party celebrated the success of Nadodi Mannan with a public function on 16 October 1958 at the Tamukkam Ground in Madurai. The function, which was attended by 200,000 people, saw Ramachandran being taken in a procession on a chariot drawn by four horses and garlanded twice. He was awarded a golden sword worth 110 pounds by the party leader C. N. Annadurai and member V. R. Nedunchezhiyan. Ramachandran later donated the sword to the Kollur Mookambika Temple. The film's 100th day theatrical run celebrations were held on 30 November 1958 at the Alagappa College in Madurai. Another round of celebrations were held on the same day at the SIAA Grounds in Chennai where Annadurai praised Ramachandran, calling him his \\"Idhayakkani\\" or \\"heart's fruit\\", also stating, \\"Praising MGR is like me praising myself\\". Ramachandran later called that moment as the most memorable one in his life.  Legacy   Impact and influence  Nadodi Mannan was a turning point in Ramachandran's career as both an actor and a politician. The film's success earned him the nickname \\"Puratchi Thalaivar\\" (\\"revolutionary leader\\"). Biographer Kannan dubbed the film as \\"the biggest propaganda blitzkrieg for the DMK till then. Film historian Swarnavel Eswaran Pillai called Nadodi Mannan Ramachandran's \\"defining film as a star\\". The film acquired cult status in Tamil cinema and propelled Saroja Devi to stardom. T. S. Subramanian of Frontline noted that it was one among many of Ramachandran's films in the 1950s where he \\"espoused his personal ideals such as helping the poor, being chivalrous and fighting injustice.\\" Film historian and critic Randor Guy labelled Nadodi Mannan as among the most memorable films both Nambiar and Veerappa had worked in. Ramachandran planned his second directorial film to be titled after the song \\"Thoongathey Thambi Thoongathey\\", but the project was abandoned, and the song was instead used as the title for a 1983 film starring Kamal Haasan. In their 2006 reviews of Imsai Arasan 23rd Pulikecei, both Baskaran of The Hindu, and S. Sudha of Rediff.com, mention the film shared similarities with Nadodi Mannan. In July 2007, S. R. Ashok Kumar of The Hindu asked eight Tamil film directors to list their all-time favourite Tamil films; K. Bhagyaraj named Nadodi Mannan. Bhagyaraj selected the film because he \\"enjoyed the way both heroes combine acting prowess with entertainment\\". In the film Padikkadavan (2009), Assault Aarumugam (Vivek) is disguised as a woman and is chased by two thugs who mistake him for a real woman. During the chase, the song \\"Maanaithedi Machan\\" is played in the background. Baradwaj Rangan, writing for The Hindu in 2014, mentions in his review of Kaththi that the film's basic plot was \\"the old template, shaped with a relevant, burning social angle.\\" For the same newspaper, Namrata Joshi noted that Prem Ratan Dhan Payo (2015) bore a resemblance to Nadodi Mannan in terms of a prince's look-alike taking his place. Lyricist Thamarai mentions in her interview with Rangan that she wishes to write songs as beautiful as \\"Thoongathey Thambi Thoongathey\\".  Cancelled sequel  Ramachandran had planned a sequel to Nadodi Mannan titled Nadodiyin Magan, but the project was abandoned.  Re-releases  Nadodi Mannan was first re-released on 4 August 2006 in Chennai and Chengalpattu by Divya Films, which spent 300,000 on poster designs and promotions for its re-release. The film opened to a positive response from the audience. It received another successful re-release on 18 March 2011 in Madurai.

He started at odds of 8/5 and won from Bwana Tumbo and Tipsand. The race was run as a handicap, with Colonel Holloway carrying 107 pounds, thirteen pounds less than the runner-up. Records show the colt ran second to Sotemia in the four mile Kentucky Endurance Stakes in October of the same year. As of 1915, Colonel Holloway was still racing in the United States and in Canada. His owner was listed as D.J. Scanlon. By 1920, Colonel Holloway was still racing at Timonium, Maryland but was considered to be no longer in good physical condition by the press. After racing No records have been found of any progeny of Colonel Holloway or of his death. Pedigree *Colonel Holloway was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Lord Clifden, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

History This band‚Äôs members are Vincent Letellier, Chimwemwe Miller, and Ian Cameron. Letellier was originally known as Freeworm, with whom Miller has been collaborating with as a vocalist and multi-instrumentalist since 2001. Ian Cameron joins the latter two as visual director to jointly form The National Parcs. Their first CD, Timbervision, was premiered at the Mus√©e d'art contemporain de Montr√©al in November 2007.CBC Radio 3 Website; The National Parcs Blog. ‚ÄúThe National Parcs Charge Ahead with Powerline.\\" Style They boast influences of hip-hop, baile funk, and gospel.

Schafer. Like Schafer they may be considered indigenists and internationalists in that they have drawn from what they found locally to produce a work that is uniquely Canadian, yet would have mass appeal to people all over the world. Unlike Schafer however, The National Parcs had no clear goal in mind when they interned themselves in the northern Quebec wilderness with their audio-video recording equipment, nor did they have any idea as to how much noise pollution from civilization they would encounter,Leijon, Justin,‚ÄúNational parcs Make Music Out of Forests‚Äù, ChartAttack, Jun 24, 2008 Their method then, consisted of audio-video sampling the three men‚Äôs interactions with nature; throwing sticks or stones together, the splash of a canoe paddle, the motor of an ATV.

They chose to leave them as raw as possible so that they would take on a percussive quality, then, a beat was added, and then the lyrics.de Guzman, Kristina, ‚ÄúNational Parcs keep that northern feel‚Äù, Vue Weekly, Jun 19, 2008, Issue no. 661 The visual element was always present to remind them of where the sounds came from, and the videos of the songs, inspired by early National Film Board nature documentaries, more than music videos are ‚Äúart videos.‚Äù While the visual element is at the genesis of their sound, and the band features special visual spectacles in their live performances, their songs make sense and are perfectly listenable when played on their own without the visuals. Critical acclaim Since their debut at the Mus√©e d‚Äôart contemporain de Montr√©al in November 2007, they were received with much acclaim from the artistic community. Their debut was so successful that the Mus√©e d‚Äôart contemporain chose to feature their material during a Triennale video-music series over the summer. On March 1, 2008, The National Parcs were awarded a MIMI-GAMIQ prize for the artist that would benefit most of support in Quebec and Canada.Dunlevy, T‚ÄôCha. ‚ÄúThe Best of the Indie Music Scene Get Their Just Rewards‚Äù, The Gazette, Mar 2, 2008 Since then they have been touring across Canada at various folk and blues festivals. In September 2008, they plan to have a residency in Normandy, France at a film festival. Due to the nature- friendly content of their work, various unnamed environmental groups have heralded the Parcs. Although the appreciation for the environment is certainly there, the band members have insisted that they do not want to have the role of activists. They warn that in the future their material may feature less wilderness content, while still drawing upon the Canadian experience to create dance music with an international appeal.

Hyamandibular marked h, top image, upper right corner The hyomandibula, commonly referred to as hyomandibular [bone] (, from , \\"upsilon- shaped\\" (œÖ), and Latin: mandibula, \\"jawbone\\") is a set of bones that is found in the hyoid region in most fishes. It usually plays a role in suspending the jaws and/or operculum (teleostomi only). It is commonly suggested that in tetrapods (land animals), the hyomandibula evolved into the columella (stapes).J. A. Clack, \\"Earliest known tetrapod braincase and the evolution of the stapes and fenestra ovalis\\", Nature 369, 392 - 394 (2 June 1994);R. Eric Lombard, et al., \\"Evolution of the tetrapod ear: an analysis and reinterpretation\\", Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, Vol. 11, No. 1, pp 19-76, 1979  Evolutionary context  In jawless fishes a series of gills opened behind the mouth, and these gills became supported by cartilaginous elements. The first set of these elements surrounded the mouth to form the jaw. There are ample evidences For example: (1) both sets of bones are made from neural crest cells (rather than mesodermal tissue like most other bones); (2) both structures form the upper and lower bars that bend forward and are hinged in the middle; and (3) the musculature of the jaw seem homologous to the gill arches of jawless fishes. (Gilbert 2000) that vertebrate jaws are homologous to the gill arches of jawless fishes. The upper portion of the second embryonic arch supporting the gill became the hyomandibular bone of jawed fishes, which supports the skull and therefore links the jaw to the cranium. Gilbert 2000, Embryonic homologies When vertebrates found their way onto land, the hyomandibula, with its location near the ear, began to function as a sound amplifier beside its function to support the skull. As evolution later attached the cranium of terrestrial vertebrates to the rest of the skull, the hyomandibula lost its supportive function and became an interior organ, the stapes, and thus its secondary function had become its primary function.

In his second Games, he became the first competitor for the People's Republic of China in Olympic history. Biography He was born in Salatiga, Central Java, Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) on August 21, 1928, the son of immigrants from Fujian, a coastal province of southeastern China. He swam from an early age, playing as a child on the riverside of Surakarta. In 1941, at the age of 13, he performed beyond all expectations at an important swimming competition in Indonesia, setting a new Indonesian record for the 200 metre butterfly and beating the Dutch champion. Wu was one of the 26 competitors‚Äîand the lone swimmer‚Äîrepresenting the Republic of China at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. Wu swam in the heats of the men's 100 metre freestyle, finishing fifth in his heat with the 32nd fastest time overall (1:03.5). In the fall of 1951, at the age of 23, Wu represented Indonesia at the 3rd World Festival of Youth and Students in East Berlin, winning a silver medal in the 100 metre backstroke, with a time of 1:12.8. At the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Wu was part of the 40-member delegation from the People's Republic of China. The government decided to send the Olympic team only one day prior to the opening ceremonies, and the basketball and football teams arrived too late to compete, making Wu the only competitor for China at those Games. Wu swam in the heats of the men's 100 metre backstroke on July 30, and finished fifth in his heat with the 28th fastest time overall (1:12.3). In August 1953, Wu competed at the 4th World Festival of Youth and Students in Bucharest, Romania. He won the 100 metre backstroke with a time of 1:06.4. His victory was so unexpected that the swimming organizers did not have a recording of the Chinese national anthem and had to borrow one from the athletics organizers. This medal ceremony was the first time that the flag of the People's Republic of China was raised at an international sporting event. In 1954, Wu and the entire Chinese swimming team was sent to Budapest, Hungary to receive training. While in Budapest, Wu attended the 12th World Student Games. Death He returned to China, where he attended the first National People's Congress. After the conclusion of the Congress, Wu died in an airplane crash in October 28, 1954 midnight in Krasnoyarsk Krai, Soviet Union, at the age of 26 while traveling to Budapest to resume his training. The flight was from Beijing to Moscow with multiple stops in between with different flight numbers. Among those, flight 136 section was from Irkutsk Airport (IKT/UIII) to Krasnoyarsk Airport (KJA/UNKL), Russia. The plane flew into the side of Mount Sivukha. On board were nine foreign passengers (the other eight were 4 Poles and 4 Cypriots) For years after his death, his skills were extolled by China's leader, Mao Zedong.

Purple and yellow lights shine on the back wall. The Southern Theater is located in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Built in 1910 as a cultural center and legitimate theater for the burgeoning Scandinavian community centered on Cedar Avenue (\\"Snoose Boulevard\\"), the Southern has been re-established as a center for contemporary performing arts over the past quarter-century. The Southern Theater is the home of Balls Cabaret, a weekly midnight cabaret entering its twenty-fourth year. Building history The Southern Theater, 1910 The 1910-era Southern featured vaudeville shows, Saturday silent movies for the kids, and original-language Scandinavian plays by the likes of August Strindberg and Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson. (It also featured \\"a set of electric chimes, twenty-seven bells scattered through the house and played by electricity‚Ä¶ this is an entirely new feature in the Northwest.\\") It maintained close ties with Stockholm‚Äôs S√∂dra Teatern (Southern Theater); an exchange program allowed actors from one Southern to perform at the other when visiting Minneapolis or Stockholm. During the 1920s the Southern offered silent films with occasional evenings of live drama, vaudeville, and amateur variety shows. In the 1930s, with the arrival of talking pictures, it became a neighborhood movie theater; in the 1940s it became an adults-only movie house which ultimately went out of business. In the late 1940s it was taken over by a contractor who used the building as a garage for heavy road equipment, leveling the floor and opening up large garage doors through the walls to accommodate his needs. (Sometime during this period the original fa√ßade was demolished as well.) It then became a warehouse and a gift shop, and in 1959 the Gaslight Restaurant opened. The Gaslight is still remembered by some as a coveted fancy dining destination (and by others as the site of marvelous pyrotechnics courtesy of the inebriated gentleman whose job it was to light the outside gaslight). The restaurant, which includes a marble bar and ticket counter, closed in the mid 1960s and the building stood vacant for about ten years. In 1975 the Guthrie Theater leased the space and refurbished it as a performance space. The Guthrie 2 had two primary components: a resident (Equity) acting company which performed \\"mainstage\\" shows at 8 PM (one of whose members was John Pielmeier, who later went on to write \\"Agnes of God\\"), and a \\"Community Space Program\\" which enabled local performers in all disciplines to use the space for late-night productions. Such notable Twin Cities performing groups as Theatre de la Jeune Lune, Illusion Theater, and Zenon Dance Company (then \\"Ozone\\") had some of their first performances as part of this program. The Equity Company aspect of the Guthrie 2 was disbanded after just a few months, but the Community Space Program lived on for several more years until the Guthrie terminated the lease on the building and closed its doors in 1979. A concerted community effort resulted in ownership being transferred to an independent non-profit corporation, the Southern Theater Foundation, and the space was again re- opened under its original \\"Southern Theater\\" name. The Southern has now been in continuous operation since 1981 as a home for the Twin Cities‚Äô finest independent performing artists.http://www.southerntheater.org/building_history.htm References External links *Southern Theater website.

It is located 5 km east of Patna Railway Station. Archaeological remains of the Mauryan period (322‚Äì185 BCE) have been discovered here, this include the ruins of a hypostyle 80-pillared hallDevise plan to save Kumhrar site:HC The Times of India, 1 February 2002.Experts' meet to preserve Kumhrar The Times of India, 26 December 2006 The excavation finding here dates back to 600 BCE, and marks the ancient capital of Ajatshatru, Chandragupta and Ashoka, and collectively the relics range from four continuous periods from 600 BCE to 600 CE.Ancient city of Pataliputra Patna Official website. Assembly Hall of 80-pillars Following the excavation of nearby Bulandi Bagh by L.A. Waddell in 1895, American archaeologist David Brainard Spooner excavated in 1912-1913 in Kumhrar one pillar of polished stone, and a very large number of fragments. The excavators were able to trace 72 'pits' of ash and rubble on the site which marked the position in which other pillars must once have stood. During the subsequent excavation, done by K P Jaiswal, 1951-1955, eight more such pits were found, giving the hall its present name ‚Äì \\"Assembly hall of 80 pillars\\". The pillars are arranged in 8 rows of 10 pillars each. The pillars are separated with each other by a distance of 4.57 meters. Each pillar is made of black spotted buff sandstone monoliths, and was 9.75 meters in height, of which 2.74 meters were below the surface for grounding. Since no other stone works were recovered, it is thought that the pillars sustained a wooden roof, and that there were no surrounding walls, making it an open-air hall. South of the pillared hall, seven wooden platforms were excavated, which are thought to have supported a staircase going into the canal to welcome guests.Museum notice on the location of the remains Plan of the 80-columns pillared hall. All the ruins are attributed to the Mauryan period, though historians vary regarding the use of the 80-pillar hall, some suggest that it was in this hall that Third Buddhist Council was held, in 250 BCE, at Ashokarama in Patiliputta (Pataliputra), under the reign of Mauryan Emperor, Ashoka (r. 273-232 BCE). The pillared hall seems to have been located about 350 meters south of the wooden palisades of the city of Pataliputra (discovered in the area of Bulandi Bagh), and was standing by the banks of the former Son river, and therefore cannot have been the Mauryan palace, but probably only \\"a pleasure hall outside the city walls\\".Fortified Cities of Ancient India: A Comparative Study, p.11 p.40-43 Dieter Schlingloff, Anthem Press, 2014 Single remaining column of the 80-column hall (this pillar was the 3rd pillar of the 6th row on the map). Portion of pillar, found in Pataliputra. Spooner initially thought that the pillars that were not found had sunk into the ground, but later research by Indian archaeologist Altekar showed that instead they had been removed by locals and reused for construction purposes. Altekar also thought that the compound was an isolated structure outside the city of Pataliputra, with not much around it, and that it had been burnt down during the time of the Sunga.A. S.

Durakhi Devi Temple ‚Äì Excavations in 1890s, by Laurence Waddell, revealed a detached piece of a carved stone railing of a stupa, with female figures on both the sides, giving it the name, 'Durukhi' or 'Durukhiya' (double faced) Devi, a specimen of Shunga art 2-1st century BCE. The figures are shown grabbing and breaking branches of trees, are Shalabhanjikas (the breaker of branches), the young women under a fertility ritual. These images were later brought to their present location, at Naya Tola (Kankarbagh), a kilometer west to the site, where they are presently worshipped in a temple-like structure; a replica of these figures has also been kept in Patna Museum.
