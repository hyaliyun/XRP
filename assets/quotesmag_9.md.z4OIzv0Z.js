It is part of the Allalin Group, a subgroup of the Mischabel Group, which culminates at the Dom (4,545 m). The summit of the Alphubel consists of a large ice-covered plateau, part of the Fee Glacier on its east side. The west side of the mountain is more rocky and much steeper. It overlooks the Weingartensee. The nearest settlements are T√§sch (north of Zermatt) and Saas-Fee.  Geography  North of the Alphubel is the higher T√§schhorn, the southernmost top of the Mischabel, from which it is separated by the saddle of Mischabeljoch (3,847 m), while the ridge to the south is less prominent running via the Alphubeljoch (3,771 m) to the Feechopf (3,888 m) and Allalinhorn. While the terrain drops steeply into the Mattertal valley to the west, the east side is flat and, compared to its neighbours, almost smooth. The characteristically flat summit of the Alphubel is mostly covered with firn and has, in addition to the main summit, a northern top of 4,188 m, which barely rises above the flat summit area. From the Alphubel a prominent, ice-free, rocky ar√™te, the Rotgrat, strikes westwards down to the T√§sch Hut (T√§schh√ºtte, 2,701 m), while the main, north-south, ridge and an unnamed ar√™te running northeast are largely covered by ice. Due to its considerable height and relatively low gradient of its slopes, there are several glaciers in the summit area of the Alphubel: To the northwest and west of the summit is the Weingarten Glacier, which has now disintegrated into three ice masses, reaching down to about 3,100 m in front of which is Lake Weingarten (Weingartensee). The entire eastern flank is taken up by the Fee Glacier, one of the larger glaciers of the region, which extends over several square kilometres and still almost reaches the valley basin near Saas-Fee. The Alphubel Glacier, the smallest glacier on the summit, lies in the south-west.  Climbing history  The first ascent of the mountain was by Leslie Stephen and T. W. Hinchliff with guides Melchior Anderegg and Peter Perren on 9 August 1860, starting at T√§sch and via the south-east ridge and the Alphubeljoch.  Routes  The morphology of the Alphubel and its proximity to the Saas-Fee funicular make the Alphubel one of the comparatively easier four-thousanders of the Swiss Alps to climb. Nevertheless, all the ascents have the character of a high mountain tour with all the typical dangers of such a tour. The normal route leads from Berghaus L√§ngflue (2,867 m) above Saas-Fee over the flat but crevassed Fee Glacier to the summit. The ascent takes 4-5 hours and is rated WS (low difficulty) on the Swiss Alpine Club's high tour scale. Another option with Saas-Fee as the base is a high-level tour from Mittelallalin (3,457 m), which can be easily reached via the Metro Alpin funicular. From there, the ascent, partly over rock, leads via the Feejoch (3826 m), Feechopf and Alphubeljoch to the summit (also WS, 4 hrs). From the west, the best known route leads from T√§sch via T√§schalp and the T√§schh√ºtte and from there over the Alphubel Glacier via the Alphubeljoch over the main south-south-east running ridge (Eisnase) to the summit. This route takes about 5 hours and is also rated WS.

National Heritage Conservation Commission  The Institution mandated by Cap 173 of the Laws of Zambia to manage and Conserve Zambia's outstanding Cultural and Natural Heritage resources is the National Heritage Conservation Commission (NHCC) which has its headquarters in [Lusaka]. According to ICOMOS (see references), the NHCC‚Äôs profile report, it lists over 4000 heritage sites in Zambia, including: * historic/architectural/buildings (over 384 sites) * historic sites (over 180 sites) * anthropological sites (over 189 sites) * engineering industrial structures (over 62 sites) * archaeological sites (over 2000 sites) * geomorphological sites, geophysical sites, palaeontological, ecology and other sites. However, only about 35% of the country‚Äôs land area has been adequately surveyed for cultural heritage and, due to a shortage of funds, the condition of most of the listed sites is not known, however, the Commission with the assistance from Government has been making strides to ensure more sites are surveyed and opened to the public.

Allen was the first black woman to be executed in the United States since 1954. She was the sixth woman to be executed since executions resumed in Oklahoma in 1977. Her final appeals and the last three months of her life were chronicled by filmmaker Liz Garbus in the documentary The Execution of Wanda Jean (2002). Background Wanda Jean Allen was born on August 17, 1959, the second of eight children. Her mother was an alcoholic; her father left home after Wanda's last sibling was born and the family lived in public housing and scraped by on public assistance. At the age of 12, Allen was hit by a truck and knocked unconscious, and at 14 or 15 she was stabbed in the left temple. It was found that Allen's actual abilities were markedly impaired and that her IQ was 69. Found particularly significant was that the left hemisphere of her brain was dysfunctional, impairing her comprehension, her ability to logically express herself, and her ability to analyze cause and effect relationships. It was also concluded that Allen was more chronically vulnerable than others to becoming disorganized by everyday stresses, and thus more vulnerable to a loss of control under stress. By age 17, she had dropped out of high school. Of the five members of the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board, three were appointed by Governor Frank Keating. Keating who considered giving Allen a stay based on the narrow issue of whether the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board had enough information regarding her education. Allen's attorneys have pointed to her score, a 69, on an IQ test she took in the 1970s, arguing she was in the range of intellectual disability. Prosecutors said Allen testified during the penalty phase of her trial that she had graduated from a high school and received a medical assistant certificate from a college. But they said Allen dropped out of high school at 16 and never finished course work in the medical assistant program. Death of Dedra Pettus In 1981, Allen was sharing an apartment with Dedra Pettus, a childhood friend-turned-girlfriend. On June 29, 1981, they got into an argument, and Allen shot and killed Pettus. In her 1981 confession, Allen stated that she accidentally shot Pettus from roughly 30 feet away while returning fire from Pettus' boyfriend. However, the forensic evidence was inconsistent with Allen's story; in particular, a police expert believed that bruises and powder burns on Pettus' body indicated that Allen had pistol-whipped her, then shot her at point-blank range. Nevertheless, prosecutors cut a deal with Allen, and she received a four-year sentence in exchange for a guilty plea to a manslaughter charge. She served two years of the sentence. Pettus was buried at Trice Hill Cemetery in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Gloria Jean Leathers Seven years after the death of Dedra Pettus, Allen was living with her girlfriend Gloria Jean Leathers. The two met in prison and had a turbulent and violent relationship. On December 2, 1988, Leathers, 29, was shot in front of The Village Police Department in Oklahoma City. Fifteen minutes before the shooting, the two women were involved in a dispute at a grocery store. A city officer escorted the two women to their house and stood by while Leathers collected her belongings. Leathers and her mother were on their way to file a complaint against Allen. When Leathers exited the car, Allen fired one shot, severely wounding Leathers in the abdomen. Leathers' mother witnessed the shooting. Two police officers and a dispatcher heard the shot fired, but no police department employee witnessed the shooting. The police recovered a .38-caliber handgun they believe was used in the shooting near the women's home. Leathers died from the injury three days later, on December 5, 1988. Leathers was buried at Green Acres Memorial Gardens Cemetery, Sperry in Tulsa County, Oklahoma. Trial The state charged Allen with first-degree murder and announced that it would seek the death penalty. Evidence that Leathers had a history of violent conduct, and that she had stabbed a woman to death in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1979, was central to the self-defense argument at Allen's trial. Allen testified that she feared Leathers because she had boasted to her about the killing. The defense sought to corroborate this claim with testimony from Leathers' mother, whom Leathers had told about the stabbing. However, the prosecution objected, and the court prohibited the introduction of such testimony because it was considered hearsay. The prosecutor depicted Allen as a remorseless liar. The jury found her guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced her to death. During the punishment phase the prosecutors argued that Allen should be sentenced to death because she had been previously convicted of a felony involving the use or threat of violence; that she was a continuing threat to society; and she committed the murder to avoid arrest or prosecution. The jury found that the first two aggravating circumstances existed in Allen's case. Her defense presented numerous mitigating circumstances including good relationship with her family, good work habits, and her fear of the victim. In the sentencing phase the prosecution presented testimony on the circumstances of the death of Dedra Pettus, and compared this previous crime to the death of Leathers. In a 1991 affidavit, her defense lawyer David Presson stated that after the trial he learned that when Allen was 15 years old, her IQ was measured at 69, placing her \\"just within the upper limit of the classification of mental retardation\\" according to the psychologist who analyzed her and that an examining doctor had recommended a neurological assessment because she manifested symptoms of brain damage. The lawyer stated, \\"I did not search for any medical or psychological records or seek expert assistance for use at the trial.\\" A psychologist conducted a comprehensive evaluation of Allen in 1995 and found clear and convincing evidence of cognitive and sensory-motor deficits and brain dysfunction possibly linked to an adolescent head injury. Execution Allen spent 12 years on death row. Her application for clemency was denied. While in prison, she became a born-again Christian. The Reverend Robin Meyers, who served as a spiritual adviser to Allen, is quoted as saying, Allen, then 41, was executed by lethal injection by the State of Oklahoma on Thursday, January 11, 2001 at Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. Twenty-four relatives of murder victim Gloria Leathers and manslaughter victim Dedra Pettus traveled there for the execution. Many of them watched the execution from behind a tinted window. While lying on the execution gurney, Allen said, \\"Father, forgive them. They know not what they do.\\" She also stuck her tongue out and smiled at her appeal lawyer, Steve Presson, who had become her friend. He says she was \\"dancing on the mattress, while they tried to kill her.\\" She was pronounced dead at 9:21 p.m. Relatives of Leathers expressed the execution gave them \\"closure\\". She was buried at Trice Hill Cemetery in Oklahoma City.

Other name for the game include Break-Opens, Nevada Tickets, Cherry Bells, Lucky 7s, Pickle Cards, Instant Bingo, Bowl Games, or Popp-Opens. The physical pull-tab tickets are usually multi-layered paper tickets containing symbols hidden behind perforated tabs. The object of the ticket is to open the perforated windows on it and reveal a winning combination. The winning pull-tab ticket is turned in for a prize‚Äîtypically cash. Game manager operate the game by selling tickets and distributing prizes. The tickets may be provided by mechanical pull-tab dispensers. Several different games may be offered for sale at any one time; each may have different prices and payouts. Pull-tabs are typically sold for 25¬¢, 50¬¢, $1, $2, $3, and $5 and have prizes as high as $5,000. Pull tab games are relatively unique among wagering games in that each game, when new, has a predetermined quantity of tickets/chances, which can range from 5,000 to 50,000 total, among which are a predetermined and fixed quantity of winning chances each of which rewards a predetermined prize value. In many setups, a potential player can see through the transparent box roughly how many chances remain and they can view on the associated tally sheet how many major winners remain at any given time. When several major winners remain among a few chances, players buy as many as they can at a time. When no major winners remain among unsold tickets, the organization takes the game out of play or retires that deal and replaces it with a brand new deal. No other finite- probability based game provides more information to players about the status of the game. The key attributes that make something a pull tab‚Äîelectronic or paper‚Äîis the finite probability basis of having a predetermined quantity of chances among which there are a predetermined quantity of winners that pay a fixed and predetermined value of prize. Redemption of one losing chance actually does mean one chance closer to a winner. This opposed to, for instance, slots that operate on near-continuum probability premises, where each event is a separate activity without bearing on the next outcome and without having been influenced from past events.  Paper tickets  Each ticket has two sides. Typically, one side lists the winning combinations of symbols, the cash payout for each combination, the number of tickets that contain each winning combination, and the total number of tickets in the game. This information is generally also posted in a large printed sheet called a flare. The other side of the ticket contains the perforated tabs. After purchasing the ticket, the player pulls the perforated tabs to reveal their winnings, if any. Cash prizes may be claimed immediately.  Electronic tickets  An electronic pull tab is derived from paper pull tabs. The first electronic pull tab patent was filed in November 1990. The electronic game closely resembled pull tabs in that when new, there are a fixed and preset quantity of chances among which are a fixed quantity of winning chances of a predetermined prize value. Furthermore, it brings the unique features of allowing players to view the quantity of chances for each given prize value in each deal, as well as other pull tab features common to pull tab operations in Minnesota, Virginia, North Dakota, and other jurisdictions. There have been several renditions of electronic pull tabs since 1990. The latest rendition was that authorized in Minnesota in the 2012 legislative session. These devices are available for use by state licensed charitable organizations. This version of an electronic pull tab uses a hand-held device, similar to a tablet computer, with a touch screen interface. All such devices are subject to control and monitoring from a central computer. Each device must have access to one or more finite sets of chances not to exceed a maximum number per set or \\"deal\\" as they are called in pull tab lingo. Sizes of the sets are under jurisdictional control and vary between maximums of 7,500 to 25,000. Among the chances are a predetermined quantity of winning and losing chances. Furthermore, the legislature stated that pull tab devices have \\"no spinning reels or other representations that mimic a video slot machine.\\" The Minnesota statute states an electronic pull-tab game means a pull-tab game containing \\"(a) facsimiles of pull-tab tickets that are played on an electronic pull-tab device.\\" One value of such systems is that they not only are much more secure than paper based systems, but afford an opportunity to present games that fall within pull-tab definitions, yet have an enhanced presentation and are more suited to the desires of an electronically oriented public. Innovative manufacturers of such gaming systems expand the entertainment value of the gaming experience through the introduction of new game presentation styles. The devices are linked wirelessly to a master computer within the bar or restaurant or to a central computer which controls many sites. In Minnesota control computers are linked to the Minnesota Gambling Control Board, which oversees all of the devices.  Legality  In 2010, approximately 20 states authorized and or licensed the use of pull tabs. The largest volume state in terms of dollar value sold is Minnesota. In some states, no pull-tab game may offer a single prize higher than a certain amount and/or may not cost more than a certain amount. For instance, in Indiana, pull tabs cannot cost more than $1 per play, and no single prize can be more than $599. In Minnesota as well as some other states, pull tabs are offered nightly from vending booths often called jar bars. All of the tickets in a game (called a \\"deal\\") are poured into a transparent container that has attached to it a \\"flare\\" or poster that displays all of the winning symbol combinations, the quantity of winning tickets at each reward level, the name of the game, etc. Also attached to the container is a tally sheet that shows a potential player exactly how many of the \\"major winners\\" (major winner is one equal to or above 50x the value of the price paid for the chance) remain in that particular game at a given time.

The song is sung by guitarist Keith Richards. It was the B-Side of Waiting on a Friend. Credited to usual Stones' writers Mick Jagger and Richards, \\"Little T&A;\\" was largely a Richards composition. He originally began writing the song in the early months of 1979 with the intention of having the song featured on 1980s Emotional Rescue. Left off that album, it re-emerged for Tattoo You two years later. The band began reworking the track in mid-1981. The song is a straightforward rocker, although Richards claims to have been influenced by rockabilly in his guitar performance. The song opens with a trademark riff from Richards, who plays bass and electric guitar along with Ronnie Wood. Ian Stewart performs on piano for the song and Jagger provides backing vocals along with Richards and Wood. Charlie Watts plays drums. The lyrics of \\"Little T&A;\\" were described by Richards at the time as being about \\"every good time I've had with somebody I'd met for a night or two and never seen again.

The song has a distinctive ending featuring a breakdown of the song's riff and beat. While the title of the song is never sung, a frequently repeated chorus: \\"She's my little rock & roll/My tits and ass with soul, baby\\" is featured throughout. \\"Little T&A;\\" was performed throughout the American Tour 1981, and was included on the concert film Let's Spend the Night Together. Richards reinstated the song to the band's setlist during the 2006 leg of the A Bigger Bang Tour, when it was played frequently. A live performance captured for the documentary Shine a Light was included on the soundtrack of the same name. The song was played frequently on Richards's 1988 and 1992 tours with the X-Pensive Winos in support of Talk Is Cheap and Main Offender records.

History  The oldest documents concerning Saihat, which are more than 400 years old, say that Saihat was under the division of Dhahran. During the Ottoman Empire, the cities under Dhahran included Saihat, Bankat, Asseeh, and Aljabba. People in that region built the city of Sawhat on the remains of the old city Avan. This name was mentioned in Al-Musadi's book (ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ®Ÿäÿ© ŸàÿßŸÑÿ•ÿ¥ÿ±ÿßŸÅ). The city was renamed Saihat in more modern times. In English the name of Saihat has various spellings. In the past, it was written as 'Seahat,' but recently the spelling has been changed by some to 'Sayhat.'  Nature  Saihat is located directly on the Persian Gulf. Fishing and agriculture are two important industries. Fertile soil and fresh springs provide a home for palm groves. The oil companies are close to Saihat, many people work there or in activities related to the oil industry. Geography Saihat is a small house close to Qatif prefecture, which forms the southern end of the city. Dammam borders Saihat from the south while all of Saihat's eastern border lies on the Persian Gulf. The estimated size of Saihat is 5.61 square kilometers. Its population is about 75,000.

It took place between 8‚Äì10 June 2007. Tickets went on sale at 9am on Thursday 22 February and were sold out by Monday 26 February. It was the first festival since 2003 with no official sponsor. The festival capacity was around 60,000. Local artist, Helen Davenport, created a illuminated wicker and tissue paper statue to commemorate the performance of Jimi Hendrix at the 1970 festival.Jimi Hendrix Sculpture The campsite was located next to the site on an extensive farmland site. The Seaclose Park site was within ten minutes' walking distance of the town of Newport. The 2007 Festival sold out in a record time of less than five days. The festival was The Rolling Stones' first British festival performance for over thirty years since their performance at the 1976 Knebworth fair. The festival once again featured the popular Carling warm beer amnesty, in which people could trade warm beer for cold cans of Carling. The Red Arrows performed a full-smoke aerial display during the festival weekend.Isle of Wight Festival 2007 The festival won the \\"Best Major Festival\\" award at the 2007 UK Festival Awards in London in November 2007. This beat off stiff competition from Glastonbury Festival, T in the Park and Reading and Leeds Festivals. This success was followed by promoter, John Giddings, winning the \\"Outstanding Contribution to UK Festivals\\" award. In reaction to this, Glastonbury organiser, Michael Eavis, offered to present Giddings with the award personally.

Ultimately the Council approved the Festival to a maximum of 60,000 attendees. The Festival's future also came under considerable jeopardy as the Isle of Wight Council tried to enforce the Isle of Wight Act 1970, resulting in a ¬£500,000 penalty on the organisers, Solo. The penalty was reduced however, and John Giddings stated that if the Island residents and councillors continued to create such problems for Solo, then the future of the Festival on the Island would be in doubt. John Giddings initially refused to issue Fairlee Road residents with complimentary weekend tickets, as he had done in previous years; perhaps due to the afore-mentioned objections. However, in May he granted free tickets to the residents, many of whom had already bought tickets, thus ending a controversial debate. There was also some debate as to whether the RMT would grant a general strike on the Island over the Festival weekend. This would have rendered the Island's bus network virtually obsolete and would have left Festival-goers with logistical problems. Thankfully, however, the strike was cancelled and Southern Vectis bus services operated as normal. Organisers Solo, were accused of being ticket touts by the Island residents as the organisers auctioned 100 tickets to the highest bidder on eBay. Giddings replied to the statement claiming 'I have the right to do what I like, because its my festival'. He also suggested that if people were against this policy then they should simply not buy tickets in this way. The notion of the organisers being touts represents a simplified accusation by those who made the claim.. Post festival controversy Many of the site security team have been both accused of being heavy-handed and ineffective, to the point where one festival attendee was physically assaulted by security resulting in a broken leg. There are claims of ejection from site without due reason by some festival goers. Others claim that security were not present during incidences where they would have been able to assist, particularly in campsite disturbances and theft.

The name derives from a- (\\"without\\") + thanatos (\\"death\\"). History The Athanatoi were a body of young men of noble status that was originally raised by John I Tzimiskes (r. 969-976) in 970 for his war with the Rus', where they played a decisive role in the battles before Preslav and during the Siege of Dorostolon. The unit was commanded by a domestikos, as with most of the other tagmata (the professional standing regiments), and on campaign camped near the imperial bodyguard, the Hetaireia. The contemporary historian Leo the Deacon describes the Athanatoi as heavily armoured shock cavalry, \\"sheathed in armour\\" or as \\"armed horsemen adorned with gold\\". Tzimiskes' unit was probably disbanded shortly after his death, since it does not appear again in the sources. The name of the Athanatoi was revived under the Emperor Michael VII (r. 1071‚Äì1078), when his minister Nikephoritzes reorganised the army. This reorganisation was part of an effort to address a major military crisis for the Empire following the disastrous defeat suffered by the Byzantines against the Seljuk Turks at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. The Seljuks had subsequently overrun most of Asia Minor, which had provided the main recruiting ground for the pre-Manzikert army. As part of the reorganisation process, the remnants of the provincial troops of the Eastern themata (military provinces) were brought together as the Immortals, providing a new tagma. The new Immortals may have been cavalry, like the bulk of the old Byzantine field army, but this is not certain. Contemporary documents seem to place the Athanatoi among other foreign contingents, but modern scholars usually consider the unit to have been composed of native Byzantines. A schematic diagram of the standard field camp layout of the Byzantine army in tha late 10th century shows the Immortals as deployed by the Imperial tent, within an outer square of Thematic units. The Byzantine historian Nikephoros Bryennios the Younger records that the Immortals numbered 10,000, but this is most likely an allusion to the old Persian Immortal Guard.\\"Byzantine Armies, 886‚Äì1118\\", Ian Heath & Angus McBride, The new unit fought under the future emperor Alexios I Komnenos in the Battle of Kalavrye (1078) against the rebel general Nikephoros Bryennios the Elder, and are mentioned in the wars against the Pechenegs in the 1090s, but disappear thereafter, along with another contemporary creation, the Archontopouloi. In popular culture In Walter Scott's novel Count Robert of Paris the Immortals appear as rivals to the Viking or Anglo-Saxon Varangian Guard for Imperial favour. In ‚ÄúRise of The Tomb Raider‚Äù (2015) the ‚ÄúAthanatoi‚Äù or ‚Äúdeathless ones‚Äù are armoured warriors who speak medieval Greek. Guarding the fictional city of Kitezh.

The process is typically associated with engineering systems, but the process can also be applied to a political policy, a business strategy or any other system that is subject to the effects of random variability. Clarification on definition Robustification as it is defined here is sometimes referred to as parameter design or robust parameter design (RPD) and is often associated with Taguchi methods. Within that context, robustification can include the process of finding the inputs that contribute most to the random variability in the output and controlling them, or tolerance design. At times the terms design for quality or Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) might also be used as synonyms. Principles Robustification works by taking advantage of two different principles. Non-linearities Consider the graph below of a relationship between an input variable x and the output Y, for which it is desired that a value of 7 is taken, of a system of interest. It can be seen that there are two possible values that x can take, 5 and 30. If the tolerance for x is independent of the nominal value, then it can also be seen that when x is set equal to 30, the expected variation of Y is less than if x were set equal to 5. The reason is that the gradient at x = 30 is less than at x = 5, and the random variability in x is suppressed as it flows to Y. File:Robustification.JPG This basic principle underlies all robustification, but in practice there are typically a number of inputs and it is the suitable point with the lowest gradient on a multi-dimensional surface that must be found. Non-constant variability Consider a case where an output Z is a function of two inputs x and y that are multiplied by each other. Z = x y For any target value of Z there is an infinite number of combinations for the nominal values of x and y that will be suitable. However, if the standard deviation of x was proportional to the nominal value and the standard deviation of y was constant, then x would be reduced (to limit the random variability that will flow from the right hand side of the equation to the left hand side) and y would be increased (with no expected increase random variability because the standard deviation is constant) to bring the value of Z to the target value. By doing this, Z would have the desired nominal value and it would be expected that its standard deviation would be at a minimum: robustified. By taking advantage of the two principles covered above, one is able to optimise a system so that the nominal value of a systems output is kept at its desired level while also minimising the likelihood of any deviation from that nominal value. This is despite the presence of random variability within the input variables. Methods There are three distinct methods of robustification, but a practitioner might use a mix that provides the best in results, resources and time. Experimental The experimental approach is probably the most widely known. It involves the identification of those variables that can be adjusted and those variables that are treated as noises. An experiment is then designed to investigate how changes to the nominal value of the adjustable variables can limit the transfer of noise from the noise variables to the output. This approach is attributed to Taguchi and is often associated with Taguchi methods. While many have found the approach to provide impressive results, the techniques have also been criticised for being statistically erroneous and inefficient. Also, the time and effort required can be significant. Another experimental method that was used for robustification is the Operating Window. It was developed in the United States before the wave of quality methods from Japan came to the West, but still remains unknown to many.See Clausing (2004) reference for more details In this approach, the noise of the inputs is continually increased as the system is modified to reduce sensitivity to that noise. This increases robustness, but also provides a clearer measure of the variability that is flowing through the system. After optimisation, the random variability of the inputs is controlled and reduced, and the system exhibits improved quality. Analytical The analytical approach relies initially on the development of an analytical model of the system of interest. The expected variability of the output is then found by using a method like the propagation of error or functions of random variables.See the 'Probabilistic Design' link in the external links for more information. These typically produce an algebraic expression that can be analysed for optimisation and robustification. This approach is only as accurate as the model developed and it can be very difficult if not impossible for complex systems. The analytical approach might also be used in conjunction with some kind of surrogate model that is based on the results of experiments or numerical simulations of the system. Numerical In the numerical approach a model is run a number of times as part of a Monte Carlo simulation or a numerical propagation of errors to predict the variability of the outputs. Numerical optimisation methods such as hill climbing or evolutionary algorithms are then used to find the optimum nominal values for the inputs. This approach typically requires less human time and effort than the other two, but it can be very demanding on computational resources during simulation and optimization.

The diaphragm and, to a lesser extent, the intercostal muscles drive respiration during quiet breathing. Additional 'accessory muscles of respiration' are typically only used under conditions of high metabolic demand (e.g. exercise) or respiratory dysfunction (e.g. an asthma attack). However, in instances where these accessory muscles become stiff and hard, expansion of the rib cage can be restricted. Maintenance of the elasticity of these muscles is crucial to the health of the respiratory system and to maximize its functional capabilities. Diaphragm The diaphragm is the major muscle responsible for breathing. It is a thin, dome-shaped muscle that separates the abdominal cavity from the thoracic cavity. During inhalation, the diaphragm contracts, so that its center moves caudally (downward) and its edges move cranially (upward). This compresses the abdominal cavity, raises the ribs upward and outward and thus expands the thoracic cavity. This expansion draws air into the lungs. When the diaphragm relaxes, elastic recoil of the lungs causes the thoracic cavity to contract, forcing air out of the lungs, and returning to its dome-shape. The diaphragm is also involved in non-respiratory functions, helping to expel vomit, faeces, and urine from the body by increasing intra-abdominal pressure, and preventing acid reflux by exerting pressure on the esophagus as it passes through the esophageal hiatus. Intercostal muscles Along with the diaphragm, the intercostal muscles are one of the most important groups of respiratory muscles. These muscles are attached between the ribs and are important in manipulating the width of the rib cage. There are three layers of intercostal muscles. The external intercostal muscles are most important in respiration. These have fibres that are angled obliquely downward and forward from rib to rib. The contraction of these fibres raises each rib toward the rib above, with the overall effect of raising the rib cage, assisting in inhalation. Accessory muscles of respiration The term \\"accessory muscles\\" refers to those that assist, but do not play a primary role, in breathing. Use of these while at rest is often interpreted as a sign of respiratory distress. There is no definitive list of accessory muscles, but the sternocleidomastoid and the scalenes (anterior, middle, and posterior) are typically included, as they assist in elevating the rib cage.Netter FH. Atlas of Human Anatomy 3rd ed. Icon Learning Systems. Teterboro, New Jersey 2003 - plate 191 The involvement of these muscles seems to depend on the degree of respiratory effort. During quiet breathing, the scalenes are consistently physically active, while the sternocleidomastoids are quiet.Raper, A. J., Thompson, W. T., Shapiro, W., & Patterson, J. L. (1966). Scalene and sternomastoid muscle function. Journal of Applied Physiology, 21, 497-502. With an increase in the respiratory volume, sternocleidomastoids also become active.Campbell, E. J. M. (1955). The role of the scalene and sternomastoid muscles in breathing in normal subjects. An electromyographic study. Journal of Anatomy, 89, 378. Both muscles are simultaneously activated when one breathes in at the maximal flow rate. Apart from the above neck muscles, the following muscles have also been observed contributing to respiration: serratus anterior, pectoralis major and pectoralis minor, trapezius, latissimus dorsi, erector spinae, iliocostalis, quadratus lumborum, serratus posterior superior, serratus posterior inferior, levatores costarum, transversus thoracis, subclavius (Kendall et al., 2005). The levator labii superioris alaeque nasi muscle lifts the sides of the nostrils. Muscles of exhalation During quiet breathing, there is little or no muscle contraction involved in exhalation; this process is simply driven by the elastic recoil of the lungs. When forceful exhalation is required, or when the elasticity of the lungs is reduced (as in emphysema), active exhalation can be achieved by contraction of the abdominal wall muscles (rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, external oblique muscle and internal oblique muscle). These press the abdominal organs cranially (upward) into the diaphragm, reducing the volume of the thoracic cavity. The internal intercostal muscles have fibres that are angled obliquely downward and backward from rib to rib. These muscles can therefore assist in lowering the rib cage, adding force to exhalation.

Mainly associated with Sussex, he is recorded in 305 matches from 1835 to 1861 which are designated first-class by CricketArchive, totalling 5,115 runs at an average of 10.54 with a highest score of 99, holding 206 catches and taking 1,144 wickets with a best analysis of 9/34. Dean achieved 5 wickets in an innings 86 times and 10 wickets in a match 18 times. His nephews David and James, both played first-class cricket. Career Dean was a right-handed batsman but was more notable as a bowler. He bowled right arm fast with a roundarm action. A good fielder, he occasionally played as a wicketkeeper. Although primarily a Sussex player, Dean played for numerous other teams but especially for the United All-England Eleven (UEE), from 1853 to 1858, of which he was the co-founder with his friend John Wisden. Formerly, from 1848 to 1852, he had represented the All- England Eleven (AEE). In Scores & Biographies, Arthur Haygarth describes Dean as \\"very stout for a cricketer\\" because he weighed 12 stone though his height was only 5 foot 7 inches. Dean's pace, says Haygarth, was \\"always straight and ripping, his balls getting up remarkably quick\\". He was a sawyer by trade and nicknamed \\"by some\\" as \\"The Ploughboy\\". Dean was engaged by MCC as a bowler in 1837 and remained in situ till he resigned at the end of the 1861 season. Haygarth, a contemporary, recounts that Dean began the UEE in 1852 \\"in conjunction with Wisden\\" and that his likeness, by John Corbett Anderson (see graphic) has been published by Fred Lillywhite. Harry Altham mentions Dean's \\"splendid work\\" for Sussex, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the AEE before (importantly to Altham) Dean was in 1862 engaged as a coach at Winchester College. Altham then relates that Dean and Wisden founded the UEE in 1852 as a result of \\"profound dissatisfaction\\" with William Clarke's management of the AEE. Several leading players such as Jem Grundy and John Lillywhite joined them and Dean and Wisden became the joint secretaries of the UEE. In his Phoenix History, Roy Webber says that interest in the AEE \\"dropped to reasonable proportions\\" after the initial sensation and offshoots began to appear, the first being Dean and Wisden's UEE in 1852 with \\"other sides to follow\\".

It was founded in 1379 by William of Wykeham to provide for the education of 16 choristers for the chapel of New College, Oxford.  History  New College School traces its origins to November 1379 when it was founded by William of Wykeham, Bishop of Winchester, as part of the foundation of the College of St Mary of Winchester in Oxford, more commonly known as New College. Wykeham himself paid for the choirboys, chaplains and clerks to sing for services at chapel. Records from the 1620s state that choirboys were accommodated on the College site itself, using an attic as the schoolroom. Despite a brief disruption due to the English Civil War the \\"school\\" continued to thrive. By the late 17th century, the vestry and song-room were refitted to accommodate new boys, marking the moment when the school started educating both choristers and non-choristers. The school did not have a permanent home for some years, moving back and forth between the College buildings and various sites outside the College. The current site was purchased in 1903 from Merton College. The school's houses (Eagles, Lions, Wolves, and Hawks) were renamed in the early twenty-first century to commemorate four famous figures from New College's past. Although no longer exclusively educating choristers, the school maintains its ties with the College: the College's Warden is Chair of the school's governing committee and the school's pupils use the College sports facilities.  Location and facilities  New College School is located on Savile Road in central Oxford, near New College. The school site has a sports hall which is used for multiple sports and shares New College's playing fields and cricket nets. Its most recent upgrade is the revamped sports pavilion, reopened in 2013.  Extracurricular activities  Sports form a major part of the school calendar. All boys from Year 3 to 8 are required to play football and rugby (Michaelmas term) and hockey (Hilary term). The school has a partnership with Oxford United F.C. and the England U16 rugby team which allows the boys to receive external coaching sessions. There are also lunchtime and after-school activities sessions where boys can participate in various hobby and interest clubs. Lunchtime activities are run every day apart from Wednesday and the after school programme operates on Monday - Friday evenings.

Discoveries by metal detectors of a copper alloy adza and an axe head, along with pottery shreds are more evidence of activity here in this period. Roman Period Archaeological evidence has also found three possible Roman settlements around Wickmere. In these areas finds include Roman pottery, coins and casting waste, dolphin brooches, a spindle whorl, staff ferrule and part of an iron key.

The windows in the aisle and chancel are decorated with tracery and are in the perpendicular style. the nave roof is a king-post construction, whilst the chancel roof is of King post design. Inside the church some of the benches date from medieval period, there is a 15th-century screen which has been restored but still retains four original panels with paintings of saints, although only Saint Andrew with his cross can be recognised. There are several notable memorials in the church, in particular, the tomb of the fifth earl of Orford, Baron Robert Horace Walpole. A white marble cartouche with cherub heads at the corners is to Henry Spelman, a soldier, who died in Calcutta in the Bengal. Wolterton Hall South of the village is the estate of Wolterton Hall. The hall was built for Horatio Walpole between 1727 and 1741 and was designed by the architect Thomas Ripley. Constructed from red brick with stone dressing the building stands in the form of a block of seven by three bays. The elevations are plain without decoration with the plan of the house being of triple pile and is an early example of the palladian standard. On the garden side of the hall, George Repton added arcading and a staircase leading to a terrace in 1829. The interior of the house has fine examples of period fireplaces and plaster ceilings. Some restoration has been carried out in the 20th century. The Hall is a Grade II listed building. The round tower of St Margaret‚Äôs Church Within the grounds of Wolterton estate can be seen the remains of Saint Margaret‚Äôs church. The round tower is all that remains of the church and the lost village of Wolterton which stood north of the church.

His research activity has been largely devoted to catalysis processes involving gas‚Äìsolid, liquid‚Äìsolid and solid‚Äìsolid interfaces. He has pioneered a molecular approach to heterogeneous catalysis, based on transition elements taken as probes, specific isotopes and physical techniques, which provided him with an original position in the field. His work has led to the emergence of interfacial coordination chemistry at the junction of colloidal, electro-, supramolecular, geo- and solid-state chemistries.

The work was written by Ben Jonson, with costumes, sets, and stage effects designed by Inigo Jones, and with music by Alfonso Ferrabosco -- the team of creators responsible for previous and subsequent masques for the Stuart Court. The marriage The masque celebrated the marriage of John, Lord Ramsay, Viscount Haddington, to Lady Elizabeth Radclyffe, the daughter of Robert Radclyffe, 5th Earl of Sussex. Following the precedent of the masque Hymenaei in 1606, the marriage was celebrated at Court because it involved an important Scottish nobleman marrying an English aristocrat, which was in keeping with the policy of King James I to favor close ties between his two kingdoms. The groom, the former Sir John Ramsay, was a close confederate of the King, and had saved James from assassination eight years earlier.Ramsay killed John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie in the so-called Gowrie Conspiracy. The preparation of the masque was supervised by James's Queen, Anne of Denmark, who was the key promoter of masquing at the Stuart Court.Leapman, pp. 94. The show The principal masquers, nobles and gentlemen of the Court, appeared in the guise of the twelve signs of the Zodiac; the men, five English and seven Scottish courtiers, were The Duke of Lennox, the Earls of Arundel, Montgomery, and Pembroke, the Lords D'Aubigny, De Walden, Hay, and Sanquhar, the Master of Mar, Sir John Kennedy, Sir Robert Rich, and a Mr. Erskine.Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 382: Edmund Lodge, Illustrations of British History, vol. 3 (London, 1838), p. 223. Their Zodiac was supported by a cast of mythical figures that included Venus, Cupid, the Graces, Hymen, and Vulcan, among others. The musicians were priests of Hymen, while Cyclops beat time with their hammers. The set for the masque was noteworthy in that it may well have been the first instance in which the proscenium arch was employed in British theatre.Leapman, P. 95. Within the arch, the initial set took the form of a large red cliff (suggesting \\"Radcliff\\"); clouds broke over it to reveal the chariot of Venus. The red cliff split open (a trademark Inigo Jones effect) to display a silver sphere that held the masquers, who emerged to perform four dances. Contemporary accounts state that the \\"singular brave masque\\" and the general dancing that followed lasted till three o'clock in the morning. The twelve principal masquers reported spent ¬£300 each on their costumes of carnation and silver. The source Illustration by Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale The masque adapts a tale from the Idyll of the Ancient Greek pastoral poet Moschus. the Idyll was extremely popular during the Renaissance and was known in various French and Italian adaptations; the actual version that Jonson employed for his text is uncertain. Publication The masque was published in quarto, in an undated edition that probably (to judge by the examples of previous masques) was issued soon after the February performance. The text was reprinted in the first folio collection of Jonson's works in 1616, and in subsequent collections of Jonson's works. NotesReferences * Chambers, E. K.

Footballer  From the Victorian country town Cobden, Merrett was a small footballer who was a keen Richmond fan who wanted to play league football for the Tigers. At 16 years of age, Merrett was rejected by Richmond legend Jack Dyer because of his light frame, but he was given another opportunity at Victoria Park, where he stood out in a set of practice games for Collingwood just before the 1950 season. It was initially thought by followers and players that he would be 'killed' because of his size (168 cm, 59 kg). He made his debut for Collingwood in 1950. At the age of 16 he was one of the youngest players in the VFL. Merrett played as a wingman and won respect for the accuracy and speed of his stab kick (which he had mastered on his farm as a kid by kicking stab passes through a suspended tyre).In Jack Dyer's opinion, Merrett \\"could stab kick a footy right up a chook's arse from 50 yards\\" (Hanlon, 2013). He became one of the best players in the competition despite his unusually small stature for a league footballer. In 1952, Merrett came equal sixth in the Brownlow Medal, and won a top three finish in the Copeland Trophy. A year later he again finished in the top 10 in the Brownlow Medal and celebrated the 1953 premiership with the Magpies, when he was one of the best players in the Grand Final. In years that followed, Merrett performed consistently and he continued to be regarded as one of the best kicks in the league, as well as one of the best wingmen. He played in two losing Grand Finals in 1955 and 1956 (he had also played in the 1952 losing side). In 1958, Merrett changed roles to become a rover, and it succeeded. He won the club Best and Fairest and the Pies also won the 1958 flag, with Merrett named best on ground. In 1959, he again starred as a rover, winning a second consecutive Copeland Trophy, and finishing in the top 10 in the Brownlow Medal for a third time (he ended up with 77 career Brownlow votes).  Retirement  A second broken leg in 1960 saw Merrett miss most of the season and, due to doubts about the strength of his leg (the bone had not knitted perfectly), aged 26, he retired, feeling his best football was past. He played 180 games in 11 seasons and kicked 148 goals. He was also a dual Best and Fairest and premiership player, and Victorian representative on seven occasions. He was a regular panelist on the ABC's Football Round-up, which he and other panelists discussed the Saturday round of VFL football. In 1997 he was included in the Collingwood Football Club Hall of Fame and Team of the Century, on the wing. Business Merrett formed a partnership with former Australian cricket captain Lindsay Hassett. The Merrett-Hassett sports stores had branches throughout Victoria. With the death of Hassett, Merrett went on to expand the stores. He later worked for Rebel Sport, a sporting goods store that later listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. In 2011 the business was taken over by the Super Retail Group.http://www.superretailgroup.com.au/about-us/our-journey/ Family Current players Jackson and Zach Merrett are Thorold's great nephews. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/draft-hopeful-jackson-merretts-worth-a- stab/story-e6frf9jf-1226178983930  Footnotes  References  * Hanlon, P., \\"The Last Men Standing\\" The Age, Wednesday, 20 March 2013  External links  Boyle's Football Photos: Thorold Merrett Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Collingwood Football Club players Cobden Football Club players Copeland Trophy winners Australian television personalities 1933 births Living people ","title":"Thorold Merrett"},{"id":"9645939","text":"Sidestrand is a village and a civil parish on the coast of the English county of Norfolk.Ordnance Survey, Explorer Sheet 252, Norfolk Coast East, The village is north of Norwich, south east of Cromer and north-east of London.

The jail is of historical importance in Stirling, being used at one time to guard an angle of Stirling's Town Wall.Thistles - Thieves Pot The Thieves Pot is accessed within the Thistles Centre itself, located near the Port Street entrance. The Thieves Pot is identified by two 'flaming' torches on the wall because a visitor could mistake this for a themed bar. However this is actually the entrance to the underground jail. Entering through the opening in the wall, the visitor must first travel down a wrought iron spiral staircase. As the visitor descends the feeling of entering a different time sets in, as the surroundings change from the busy shopping centre into a confined jail environment.Thieves Pot and Bastion Stirling Admission to the Thieves Pot is free, and can be visited whenever the shopping centre is open. Looking around a visitor will see a circular rough stone room, this is the original guardroom which existed in the walls which used to defend Stirling. The guardroom which the visitor enters into contains different artefacts; including Justice Figure and Stirling Heads which are placed as historical presentations, giving information on the room and the history of what happened there. There is also the Thieves Pot below this room, this was the prison where people would be sent as a jail. This is a dark cramped space, also known as an oubliette, which is viewable through a glass floor panel and contains a model representation of a prisoner down in the prison. The entrance to this prison space would originally have been accessed through a trapdoor which would have been present where the glass viewing panel now is in the floor.

He sang in various Namibian languages but also Afrikaans and English. He was born Jackson Muningandu Kaujeua, a member of the Herero ethnic group in «ÉHuns, a village near Keetmanshoop. Later, he gave up an education as a priest at the mission school of Otjimbingwe after he came in touch with the songs of gospel singers like Mahalia Jackson, whose human rights-related lyrics inspired him. In 1973, he started studying music at the \\"Dorkay Art & Music College for Talented Non-Whites\\" in South Africa. However, he was soon expelled from the country for anti-apartheid activism, and went into exile in 1974. After a short time in Botswana, the SWAPO-resistance movement (with which he was associated with until his death) helped him to move to the UK, where he soon became the lead singer of the group Black Diamond. International success followed with songs such as \\"Winds of Change\\". Having lived as a teacher in an Angolan refugee camp from 1979 to early 80s and later in Sweden, he returned to Namibia before independence in 1990, where he celebrated great successes with his music, especially with «ÉGnubu «ÉNubus (). In the late 1990s, he was still one of the best-known Namibian musicians. Kaujeua died of kidney failure on 27 May 2010, after suffering from a kidney disorder for six months. In Namibia, kidney dialysis is only available in privately run medical facilities, which most citizens are unable to afford. Kaujeua had lived and died in poverty. He was formally unemployed for most of his life, living off his performances and royalties. Calls for some sort of employment or empowerment for his role as \\"musical ambassador for the liberation struggle\\" were not answered by the authorities. Kaujeua had four children.

The theory may also explain the existence of other cultural features, or lack thereof, in differing regions; though it was specifically created to address linguistic differences. Overview In general, the theory states that new words, often synonyms, are created in influential areas and cultural centers. Over time, these words gradually move outward to less culturally influential areas in a ripple pattern. Over time, the new words may travel a great distance. However, during their slow progression outwards from the cultural center, new words are also being created and gradually moving outwards. New words may not have the \\"momentum\\" necessary to propagate to all areas where the language is used. Typically, areas that are farthest away from a cultural center will possess only the oldest form of a word and no others, though the new words often still remain active in the cultural center where they were created, along with other synonym variations. Origin This theory was postulated by Yanagita Kunio to explain the existence of some words in cultural centers, such as the capital of Japan, during various stages of the nation's history, and the lack of those such words in non-cultural centers. It is not certain if his postulate was the first to describe such cultural patterns in general; or merely with respect to language. Example Example word for the Center versus Periphery over time One phenomenon the theory attempts to explain, for example, is the Japanese word for snail, particularly prior to the Meiji period. In Kyoto, the capital of Japan around the time of the Edo period, there were as many as four different words for snail: dedemushi („Åß„Åß„ÇÄ„Åó), maimai („Åæ„ÅÑ„Åæ„ÅÑ), katatsumuri („Åã„Åü„Å§„ÇÄ„Çä), and tsuburi („Å§„Å∂„Çä). In the areas outside the capital, not all of these words existed. As one traveled farther from the capital, the number of synonyms employed decreased. In the farthest reaches of Japan in the North and the South, typically only one word for \\"snail\\" was used. Coincidentally, often the same single word existed in both places (in this case tsuburi („Å§„Å∂„Çä)), despite the great distance between the regions. Some linguists have taken this existence of some words in the farthest regions from cultural centers as an indication of the age of certain of these words.

He earned a BA in journalism from Washington & Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, in 1957 and, following a short period as a reporter for the Twin City Sentinel in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and brief service in the US Army, an MS in journalism from Columbia University in New York in 1959. Early life After freelancing articles to the then-young Village Voice while at Columbia, he worked as a reporter for the Times-Picayune and as news editor of WWL Radio in New Orleans (1959‚Äì1961). He joined Mike Wallace as a writer-producer in New York for one year (1961‚Äì62) then moved to Los Angeles where he was a talent coordinator and writer-producer for Steve Allen (1962‚Äì1964). He also wrote and produced television programs for Mort Sahl, ABC-TV and Universal Studios (1964‚Äì1966; 1971). He wrote his first books during this period, an as-told-to autobiography of a health faddist, Bare Feet and Good Things to Eat (1965) and an astrological spoof, You Were Born on a Rotten Day (1969).

She was the first African American woman to receive a doctorate degree in zoology. Early years Born in Clifton Forge, Virginia in 1899, Young soon moved with her family to Burgettstown, Pennsylvania. The family was poor and much time and resources were expended in the care of her disabled mother. In 1916, Young enrolled at Howard University in Washington, D.C. to study music. She wrote in the yearbook: \\"Not failure, but low aim is a crime.\\" She did not take her first science course until 1921. Though her grades were poor at the beginning of her college career, some of her teachers saw promise in her. One of these was Ernest Everett Just, a prominent black biologist and head of the Zoology department at Howard. Young graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1923. Just tried unsuccessfully to help her to gain funding for graduate school, but in 1924 Young began studying for her master's degree at the University of Chicago, which she received in 1926. Young worked with Ernest Everett Just for many years, teaching as an Assistant Professor at Howard University from 1923 to 1935. Research was done during the summers. Young assisted Just in his research from 1927 through 1930, but although her assistance was noted in his grant applications, her name does not appear as a coauthor in the resulting publications. While studying at Chicago, she was asked to join Sigma Xi, a scientific research society, which was an unusual honor for a master's student. In 1924 her first article, \\"On the excretory apparatus in Paramecium\\" was published in the journal Science, making her the first African American woman to research and professionally publish in this field. Career Ernest Everett Just invited Young to work with him during summers at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts beginning in 1927. While there, they worked on researching the fertilization process in marine organisms, as well as the process of hydration and dehydration in living cells. In 1929, Young became interim department head for the zoology department at Howard University for the time while Just was in Europe seeking grant money. Young's eyes were permanently damaged by the ultraviolet rays used in the experiments conducted at Howard for Just. In the fall of 1929, Young returned to the University of Chicago to begin her doctorate degree under the direction of Frank Rattray Lillie. Lillie had been a mentor of Just while both were involved with the Marine Biological Laboratory. However, in 1930 she failed to pass her qualifying exams, and for a time, disappeared from the scientific community. She returned to Howard University to teach and continued working with Just at the Marine Biological Laboratory during the summers. However, around 1935, rumors started circulating that there was a romance between Just and Young, and in 1936 they had a huge confrontation. Later that year she was fired, ostensibly because she missed classes. In her words, \\"The situation here is so cruel and cowardly that every spark of sentiment that I have held for Howard is cold.\\" She used this setback as an opportunity to try again to obtain a Ph.D. In June 1937, she went to the University of Pennsylvania, studying with Lewis Victor Heilbrunn (another scientist she met at the Marine Biological Laboratory) and graduated with her doctorate in 1940. After obtaining her doctorate, Young became an assistant professor at the North Carolina College for Negroes and Shaw University (1940‚Äì1947), and held teaching positions in Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana until 1959. Young contributed a great deal of work to science. She studied the effects of direct and indirect radiation on sea urchin eggs, on the structures that control the salt concentration in paramecium, as well as hydration and dehydration of living cells. Personal life Young was never married. In addition to the occupation-related damage to her eyes, she had financial struggles, and was the sole support for her ill mother until she died. Away from Howard, her options as an African-American woman scientist were limited to teaching positions without access to research facilities and support. In the 1950s, she hospitalized herself for mental health problems. Roger Arliner Young died on November 9, 1964 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Honors Roger Arliner Young was recognized in 2005 in a Congressional Resolution along with four other African American women \\"who have broken through many barriers to achieve greatness in science.\\" The others honored were Ruth Ella Moore (\\"who in 1933 became the first African American woman to earn a Ph.D. in natural science from the Ohio State University\\"), Euphemia Lofton Haynes (\\"who in 1943 became the first African American woman to receive a Ph.D. in mathematics from the Catholic University of America\\"), Shirley Ann Jackson (\\"who in 1973 became the first African American woman to receive a Ph.D. in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\"), and Mae Jemison (\\"a physician and the first African American woman in space\\"). A group of environmental and conservation groups established the Roger Arliner Young (RAY) Marine Conservation Diversity Fellowship in Young's honor, to support young African Americans who want to become involved in marine environmental conservation work.

Club career Zong Lei started his football career playing for the Tianjin Teda F.C. youth team before breaking into the senior team during the 2001 league season. While at Tianjin Teda he would struggle to gain any significant playing time and after several seasons he would transfer to Shandong Luneng where he replaced Deng Xiaofei for the goalkeeping position for a short period. It was during this time that he would win the Chinese FA Cup and Super League Cup at the end of the 2004 league season, however the following season saw him lose his place within the team. By the beginning of the 2006 league season newly promoted Changchun Yatai were interested in him and he was allowed to leave after a 2 million yuan transfer. At Changchun Yatai he would immediately become their first choice goalkeeper and see them surprise many by coming fourth in the league. The following season saw him improve upon the previous season's results and he would go on to play a key role in their 2007 Chinese Super League title winning season. Zong returned to Tianjin Teda in 2013. He retired from football at the end of 2016 season. International career In preparation for the 2007 AFC Asian Cup Zong Lei would play in a friendly against Kazakhstan on February 2, 2007 where he made his international debut in a game, which China won 2-1. His performance was considered good enough for the Chinese Head coach Zhu Guanghu to include him in the tournament where he was the third choice goalkeeper and did not play in any games. When the new head coach Vladimir Petroviƒá came in immediately after the tournament Zong Lei would be promoted as the national team's first choice goalkeeper and would play in several FIFA World Cup qualifiers. When China failed to qualify and Vladimir Petroviƒá's reign ended Zong Lei would find himself out of favour and was dropped from the subsequent squads.

BI programs combine information technology (IT) and management courses and are common in central Europe.Doukidis, G., et al. (Hrsg.): Proceedings of the 3rd European Conference on Information Systems (ECIS '95). Athens 1995, pp. 1295‚Äì1297 The first master programs in Business Informatics were offered by the University of Rostock, as a face-to-face program, and by the Virtual Global University (VGU) together with the European University Viadrina Frankfurt (Oder) as an online program (see virtual education). An MBI programme, which includes inter-cultural studies affecting business operations in European markets, was first offered by Dublin City University. Within the Bologna process, many Central European universities have been, or are in the process of, setting up master programmes in Business Informatics. Due to legal frameworks and restrictions, however, most of these programs are forced to award an M.Sc. degree instead of an MBI degree.  Example  A typical MBI program is the VGU's \\"International Master of Business Informatics\\" program in Germany. Since this program was set up and accredited in accordance with nationwide guidelines for content and structure, it reflects well the state-of-the-art of Business Informatics master programs. If studied full-time, the MBI program is a four-semester program and can be composed of courses from the following areas of study. Another typical MBI program is the MIAGE:fr:MIAGE (M√©thodes Informatiques Appliqu√©es √† la Gestion des Entreprises) program in France, present in more than 20 universities (MIAGE Toulouse,MIAGE Paris Ouest Nanterre La D√©fense, MIAGE Dauphine, MIAGE Aix-Marseille, MIAGE Grenoble Alpes, MIAGE Sorbonne, MIAGE Lille). Some MBI programs are organized in tracks or profiles, guiding the students in the design of their master study plan. This is the case of the \\"Master in Business Informatics\\" in Utrecht University, which allows students to specialize in one of the following four career areas: business consultant (provides business advice from an ICT perspective), IT consultant (provides ICT advice from a business perspective), entrepreneur (independent entrepreneur who develops ICT products), and IT researcher (continuing with a PhD or targeting a research and development department in a software company).  Typical areas of study  * Basic Technology: Courses may include topics like applied computer science, computer networks and Internet technology, website engineering, programming, or information security. * Business Informatics Methods: Courses may focus on information systems development, database management, information systems architectures, business intelligence, or business process modelling. * Management: Management oriented topics may be studied in courses on management information systems, information management, project management, management control, knowledge management, management and organization of IT departments, or software engineering management. * Applications: Important application domains of Business Informatics may be investigated in courses like enterprise resource planning, e-commerce and e-business networking, industrial information systems, or electronic finance/electronic banking.  Typical positions for MBI graduates  Graduates in Business Informatics can fill positions like information manager, systems analyst, systems designer, project manager, business solutions developer, IT entrepreneur, IS specialist, consultant in areas like enterprise resource planning, supply chain management, customer relationship management, or knowledge management.

It opened on 1 October 1976 in a building basement on Mathew Street opposite The Cavern Club where The Beatles and other bands of the 1960s played, and became notable for hosting early performances by many punk and post-punk bands. The club was started by Roger Eagle and Ken Testi (manager of cult Liverpool band Deaf School) and joined later by Pete Fulwell (owner of a small record label \\"Inevitable\\" and later to become manager of Liverpool bands It's Immaterial and The Christians). The club was given the name 'Eric's' by Ken Testi as an antidote to disco clubs with names such as 'Tiffany's' and 'Samantha's' Music The club played host to many local, national and international bands primarily within the music sub-cultures of the time, such as Elvis Costello, Buzzcocks, The Clash, Joy Division, Ramones, Sex Pistols, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Cardiacs, The Slits, Talking Heads, The Stranglers, Ultravox, Wire, XTC, X-Ray Spex and early gigs by New Order and Mick Hucknall (pre Simply Red). The club acted as a catalyst for local musicians (often also from the Runcorn, Southport, Skelmersdale, Wirral areas) and saw many local artists later become successful acts, including Dead or Alive, Echo & the Bunnymen, Julian Cope, The Teardrop Explodes, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, Ellery Bop and Wah! Heat. A copy of a membership card. Eric's was a membership only venue whereby members had to buy a yearly membership to enter the club. One of the more beneficial ideas was to provide membership for 'under 18's', which allowed younger music fans to see both local and national bands during a 'matinee' show they would more often than not have had a chance to see. It could be argued that this was merely a marketing ploy or revenue generating exercise, but this encouraged more prominent national bands and artists to visit Liverpool and helped provide a social networking venue for some of the city's future musical artists. Closing The club lasted until March 1980 when it was raided by police for drug offences. The final acts that night where The Psychedelic Furs supported by Wah! Heat. Wah! Heat's performance was recorded for a John Peel session, and the poem \\"The Last Night of Erics (A small opera in the making)\\" was penned by Rob Jones. Later the club reopened as Bradys, to last some 12 months before closing. Current status The original venue building was until mid-2011 (see below) part of the local 'trendy' orientated bar/club culture playing contemporary pop/dance music and is still on Mathew Street, which has an annual festival to promote Liverpool music. The club's main members entrance was situated below (though slightly to the right) of the Beatles Mural sculpture on Mathew Street, which is featured on the wall, opposite the current Cavern club. In October 2011, a new venue called ‚ÄòErics Live‚Äô was opened by a local Liverpool business person. Although occupying the same location, the new owner and venue have no connection with the original club. The venture, and use of the name and logo, was condemned by a founding owner and many members of the original club, and has since closed. The venue reopened once again shortly after, this time under different ownership, but taking a direction back to the building's original roots of showcasing local live music every night, Eric's can be visited 7 nights a week on Mathew Street. .

WPON was founded in September 1954, with studios in Pontiac, Michigan, and towers located at the corner of Square Lake Road and Telegraph Road in neighboring Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. The station was owned for many years by Chief Pontiac Broadcasting, broadcasting such formats as top-40 and Country music. Broadcasting at 1000 watts omnidirectional, the station covered the majority of Oakland County. The station was sold in 1986 to Algis Zaparakis, who in turn sold the land containing the tower array in Bloomfield Hills to developers, and moved the tower array to a swamp near Wolverine Lake in Walled Lake, Michigan. The move forced WPON to change its power to 1000 watts directional daytime, and 760 watts directional nighttime. This change in power saw many of WPON's listeners unable to pick up the station's signal in much of its former coverage area. The format was changed to ethnic in 1986, and stayed this way until the station was purchased in 1995 by Foreign Radio Programs, Inc. Under the leadership of station manager Marie Fotion, WPON started a semi-successful \\"Talk and Oldies\\" brokered radio format in 1997, specializing in hard-to-find oldies from the 1950s through the early 1970s. More recently the station also began airing pre-rock \\"traditional\\" pop/nostalgia hits from the early and mid-1950s mixed in with the rock and roll oldies, possibly to appease fans of CKWW, a former adult standards station which now also plays rock oldies. WPON was again sold in 2003 to Birach Broadcasting Corporation, who closed the old Bloomfield Hills studios and moved operations to Birach headquarters located in the Town Center Plaza in Southfield, Michigan. WPON is streaming their \\"Talk and Rare Oldies\\" format live through their website. Shows, hosts and DJs Through the years, WPON was home for many of to metro-Detroit area's finest on-air talent, aspiring and seasoned alike. For many years, \\"Crazy Al\\" (Allyn Schmitz) hosted the morning show \\"Crazy Al's Radio Party\\" along with Larry Matthews and others. The program saw a variety of guests from the community as well as moderately popular \\"oldies\\" musicians. Crazy Al, known for his wildly over-the-top personality brought rare oldies and talk to the community until Al and the gang left WPON in May 2004, shortly after the sale of the station to Birach Broadcasting Corporation.

After a career as a civil engineer before and after serving in the Royal Navy in the Second World War, he became widely recognised as one of the leading English painters of marine subjects. Early life Gardner was born in Buckinghamshire. His father was a civil engineer who worked for the Great Central Railway in the docks at Grimsby and became chief engineer of the Port of Glasgow in 1928, and Gardner developed a love of ships. He was educated at Oundle School, where he won a prize for his drawing. He left school in 1931, and trained as a civil engineer in Glasgow with the London Midland & Scottish Railway. He later joined Sir William Arrol & Co. He joined the RNVR as a 20-year-old midshipman, and took up painting watercolours of warships. He became a docks engineer at North Shields in 1938. Second World War Gardner was called up in August 1939, shortly after the Second World War broke out, and served as anti-submarine officer on the Royal Navy destroyer HMS Broke. His ship escorted convoys in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, and was then posted to the Mediterranean to support the Operation Torch landings in North Africa. He joined Operation Terminal, the storming of Algiers harbour in November 1942. The destroyers HMS Broke and HMS Malcolm were tasked with securing the port facilities and power station at Algiers. Malcolm came under fire and was forced to withdraw with engine damage, but Broke rammed through a boom protecting the harbour and disembarked its shore party. Broke then also came under heavy fire from Vichy French forces and was forced to withdraw. Broke sank the next day while heading for Gibraltar. Her crew, including Gardner, were rescued by the destroyer HMS Zetland and returned to Algiers, now captured by the Allies, before returning to England on a Dutch liner. The convoy was attacked by a submarine: the escort carrier immediately ahead, , was torpedoed and sank. Gardner had been injured in Algiers, and was rendered deaf in one ear. He was later mentioned in dispatches for his actions. He joined the destroyer HMS Highlander in 1943, serving again in the Atlantic, but his deafness then forced him to serve on land rather than at sea. He was promoted to lieutenant commander and served on the staff of Admiral Sir Max Horton, commander of the Western Approaches based in Liverpool. By the end of the war, he was an acting commander, serving as Assistant Chief Staff Officer Ceylon, based in Colombo. He was demobilised in 1946. He was awarded the Volunteer Reserve Decoration (VRD). Post-war career Gardner joined the Colonial Service after the war, serving in Kenya from 1951. He met his wife, Mary, at a dance in Mombasa. He then worked as an engineer in west Kenya, living in Kisumu beside Lake Victoria, before moving to Nakuru, where he painted oils, watercolours and pastels of local scenes, such as flamingos on a nearby soda lake. He caught tick typhus, and became deaf in both ears. He returned to England with his family in 1963, and retired to Dorset. He turned to painting maritime subjects. His detailed paintings found a ready market, and he held several exhibitions in London. He is best known for his paintings of warships from the Napoleonic Wars, and paintings of clippers from later in the 19th century. An exhibition of his work at Messum's gallery in Mayfair in October 2005, the bicentenary of the Battle of Trafalgar, included paintings of every ship in which Nelson had served. A book of the paintings, Nelson's Ships: A Trafalgar Tribute. He was a Fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers, and also a member of the Royal Society of Marine Artists. He was survived by his wife, and their son and daughter.

Francois Bernheim, former singer of the group Les Roche-Martin and artistic director for the record company Barclay, discovered the singers in 1970 and decided to create a group called Les Poppys, named after the word 'Pop Music'. Les Poppys originated from the Hippie movement and made songs against the Vietnam War. Seventeen boys from the choir were then selected and recorded their first single: 'Noel 70'. The success came very quickly and 600,000 copies were sold. This first single was then followed by other hits during the 70's: 'Isabelle, je t'aime' (500,000 copies sold). The most successful chanson was Non, non, rien n'a chang√©, for which Bruno Polius was the lead solo singer, and which sold 1,200,000 copies and was a number one hit in The Netherlands and stayed in the Dutch Top 40 for 25 weeks. Les Poppys became the first child stars in French music history and were quickly invited by other countries to sing in galas, concerts and TV shows. In The Netherlands and in Germany, they even sold more records than the Beatles. In 4 years, Les Poppys sold more than 5 million records and produced four albums and 20 singles from 1970 to 1977. Their success inspired the New Poppys and other groups such as Mercredi Libre from members of Les Petits Chanteurs D'Asni√®res. The small singers of Asni√®res, as they were, consisted of the first generation of Poppys: Bruno Polius, Harry Trowbridge, Philippe and Gabriel K√©p√©klian, Thierry and Philippe Sellier, Philippe and Jean-Pierre Herman, Philippe Magnan, Jean-Jacques Gallard, Pascal Buffenoir, Pierre Puyhardy, Olivier Dubrez, Benoit Cabane, Christophe Normand, Bernard Carayon, Olivier Antignac. Some among them left since 1971 to yield to the second generation of Poppys which included G√©rald Meunier, Pascal Oubrayrie, Alain Drexler, Pascal R√©ali and Daniel Danglard. The group ended in 1978 but Les Petits Chanteurs d'Asni√®res kept on recording, making backgrounds vocals for famous singers. They also sang in 1983 for a TV musical covering songs by ABBA called Abbacadabra. Their 2 albums made were called: Abbacadabra and La Fus√©e de No√©. They also had a one off success with the song \\"Il faudra leur dire\\" sung with Francis Cabrel which went gold in 1987. They have since tried a comeback firstly in the late eighties under the name The New Poppys and in 1992 as Mercredi Libre. Although these last recordings were not commercially successful the album La ballade des p'tits anges has become highly praised and sought after. Although it has been suggested that the singing is better on this CD it is most likely due to the new songs included on this CD. The music to Commandant de la Calypso, La ballade des p'tits anges, Je te demande pas and other popular songs from this album was written by Francois Bernheim. The Poppys still go on tour occasionally. Selected discography * No√´l 70 (Christmas 70) (1970) * Non, je ne veux pas faire la guerre...

The film was produced by Marco Bechis, Enrique Pi√±eyro (from Argentina), Amedeo Pagani (Italy), and Eric Heumann (France). Executive producers Daniel Burman and Diego Dubcovsky. The picture is about a young politically active Argentine woman who is kidnapped by the military during Argentina's Dirty War in the late 1970s. She is taken to a torture center called Garage Olimpo in the middle of Buenos Aires. Plot The film tells of Maria (Antonella Costa), an activist fighting the Argentinian military dictatorship during the Dirty War. She teaches reading and writing in a poor suburb of Buenos Aires and lives with her mother Diane (Dominique Sanda), who rents out rooms. One of the lodgers is a young man named Felix (Carlos Echevarr√≠a), who is in love with Maria, and rather shy. Felix seems to have come from nowhere and is supposed to work as a watchman in a garage. One morning, Maria is kidnapped by a military squad in civilian clothes in front of her mother and is taken to the garage Olimpo, one of the many well-known torture places in the middle of Buenos Aires, which operate with the general indifference of the locals. As soon as Maria is captured the film's mood becomes uncomfortable and the atmosphere is minimalist. The head of the center, Tigre (Enrique Pi√±eyro), asks Felix, their best torturer, to make Maria talk. Yet, Felix is overcome by his feelings for Maria, and Maria is determined to exploit this for her survival.

During the junta's rule: the parliament was suspended, unions, political parties and provincial governments were banned, and in what became known as the Dirty War between 9,000 and 30,000 people deemed left-wing \\"subversives\\" disappeared from society.The Vanished Gallery. As the country celebrated its win of the World Cup, many political activists were tortured in Buenos Aires and then later taken on \\"death flights\\", where victims were drugged and then dropped alive into the Atlantic Ocean from military aircraft.

FilmFestivals.com, reporting from the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. Distribution The film was first presented at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival on May 16 in the Un Certain Regard section.

The film was screened at various film festivals, including: the Toronto International Film Festival, Canada; the Huelva Latin American Film Festival, Spain; the Norwegian International Film Festival, Norway; the Human Rights Watch Film Festival, New York City; the Amnesty International Film Festival, Netherlands; and others. Reception=Critical response Stephen Holden, film critic for The New York Times, wrote the film is \\"notable on the international front...a not-for-the- squeamish film from Argentina about an opponent of the military dictatorship who is tortured in a garage in the heart of Buenos Aires.\\"Holden, Stephen. The New York Times, \\"No Fluff, No Gimmickry In These Searing Stories,\\" June 16, 2000. Critic Jonathan Hollander liked the directorial lead of Marco Bechis, and wrote, \\"Garage Olimpo is the kind of valuable cultural product that symbolises political regeneration...himself a victim of the country's regime ‚Äì he was forced to leave Argentina in 1977, at the age of 20, for political reasons ‚Äì director Marco Bechis has the necessary moral authority to make this film.\\"Hollander, Jonathan. Ibid. Michael Thomson, writing for the BBC, lauded the film and the passion of director Marco Bechis, and wrote, \\"It is director Marco Bechis' softly-softly approach which fills each frame with real power and leaves you in no doubt as to his commitment and passion. It is indeed no surprise to learn that this Italian-Chilean was himself snatched by the military in Buenos Aires and tortured. Yet, despite his admirable insistence on moving us with the truth (helped by his grainy camera work), Bechis can also tell a tale and he gradually incorporates a race-against-time element. Will Maria escape, especially when she is taken out on the town by her captor? Let's just say that the answer would be alien to Hollywood.\\"Thomson, Michael.

The HECToR service was run by partners including EPCC, Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) and Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG).Inside the UK's fastest machine, James Randerson, Guardian, Wed 2 January 2008 The supercomputer itself (currently a Cray XE6) was located at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. The first phase came on line in October 2007, and, by the time it was decommissioned, it had been upgraded to Phase 3 configuration, with a peak performance of over 800 teraflops. Its successor is called ARCHER.http://www.archer.ac.uk  Hardware  HECToR's hardware configuration has been progressively upgraded since the system was first commissioned.  Phase 1  HECToR's initial configuration, known as Phase 1, featured 60 Cray XT4 cabinets containing 1416 compute blades, giving a total of 11,328 2.8 GHz AMD Opteron processor cores, connected to 576 terabytes of RAID backing storage, later increased to 934 TB. The peak performance of the system was 59 teraflops. In August 2008, 28 Cray X2 Black Widow vector compute nodes were added to the system. Each node had 4 vector processors, giving a total of 112 processors. Each processor was capable of 25.6 gigaflops, giving a peak performance of 2.87 teraflops. Each 4-processor node shared 32 gigabytes of memory.  Phase 2a  In the summer of 2009, the XT4 cabinets were upgraded with quad-core 2.3 GHz Opteron processors with 8 GB memory each. This doubled the number of processor cores to 22,656, and increased total system memory to 45.3 terabytes. Peak performance was increased to 208 teraflops.  Phase 2b  The Phase 2b upgrade, performed in 2010, involved installation of a new 20-cabinet Cray XT6 system featuring 12-core Opteron 6100 processors, giving a total of 44,544 cores and a peak performance of over 360 teraflops. At the same time the existing XT4 system was reduced to approximately half its original size. A further upgrade took place later in 2010 to replace the SeaStar2 interconnect with a new interconnect technology, codenamed Gemini.  Phase 3  The Phase 3 upgrade took place in November and December 2011. It involved extending the XT6 system to 30 cabinets containing 704 compute blades, and upgrading the processors to 16-core, 2.3 GHz Interlagos Opterons, giving a total of 90,112 cores. The operating system was also upgraded to CLE 4.0.  Software  HECToR's operating system is Cray Linux Environment (CLE), formerly known as UNICOS/lc. A variety of applications, compilers and utilities are available to users. HECToR supports four compiler suites: * PGI compilers (v7.1-4) - pgf90, pgf77, pgcc, pgCC. * Pathscale compilers (v3.1) - pathf90, pathcc, pathCC. * GNU compilers (v4.2.3) - gfortran, gcc. * Cray compilers. Compilation for the HECToR backend nodes is facilitated through the Cray compilation scripts: ftn, cc, and CC.

The plateau lies south of the Adamawa Plateau and southeast of the Cameroon Range. It slopes south and west until giving way to the Cameroon coastal plain in the southwest and the Congo River basin in the southeast. The plateau is characterised by hills and valleys in the southwest and a more gentle peneplain in the southwest. Isolated massifs occur, especially in the southwest. Metamorphic rocks make up the plain's basement. The soils are ferrallitic and lateritic, with colouration ranging from red or brown in the interior to yellow on the coast. The soils are subjected to silica leeching, so they are not productive without fertiliser. The plateau experiences four major seasons, two rainy, and two dry. Rainfall is high, especially along the coast. The average temperature changes little from 25¬∞C. Rivers in the region drain into the Atlantic Ocean and the Congo River basin. South of the Sanaga, rivers flow steadily year- round, but the Sanaga and rivers north have a complex regime characterised by high- and low-water periods upstream and constant flow downstream. The predominant vegetation is rainforest, especially to the plateau's south. To the north, forests give way to savanna. Topography The South Cameroon Plateau lies between 2 and 6¬∞ N and 10 and 16¬∞ E. It covers about 225,100 km¬≤, more than half of Cameroon's total area. The plateau is characterised by sloping terrain and gently rolling hills.Gwanfogbe et al. 9. The altitude varies from 250 to 800 m and averages 600 or 650 m.Gwanfogbe et al. 9 says 600 m; Neba 16 says 650 m. The Western High Plateau lies northwest of the plateau and separates it from the interior African plain.Gwanfogbe et al. 7. The Adamawa Plateau lies to the plateau's north. From an altitude between 800 and 900 m.Neba 16. there, the plateau slowly slopes south and west from the region of Bedzare and Meiganga. Lob√© Falls To the southwest, large inselbergs and tall hills separated by deep gullies predominate. The plateau gives way to the Cameroon coastal plain in escarpments.Gwanfogbe et al. 9; Neba 16. This topography has resulted in the creation of the Lob√© Falls near Kribi, where the Lob√© River meets the sea in a series of rapids. Some of the plateau's highest points are in this region, such as Mbam Minkom near Yaound√© (1,295 m), and Ntem massif near Ebolowa (1,400 m). To the southeast, the transition to the Congo basin takes place on a gently sloping peneplain. The hills of the eastern portion are gentler than those of the west. These hills are known as half-oranges and can easily be seen in the area of Batouri and B√©labo. The lowest point of the plateau is the Sangha River valley in the southeast. Geology Metamorphic rocks such as gneiss, mica, migmatites, and schists make up the South Cameroon Plateau's basement. Deposits of these rocks appear along fault lines south of Yaound√©, where schists and quartzites are found; near the Dja River, where limestone and schists occur; and along the Ntem River, where gneiss, granite, mica, migmatite, and schists occur.Gwanfogbe et al. 12. The plateau's western portions are made up primarily of gneiss. These rocks are millions of years old.Neba 23. The plateau's soils are predominantly ferrallitic and lateritic, the result of decomposing crystalline and sedimentary stone. The soil colour varies from red or reddish brown in the interior to yellow along the coast, where greater humidity causes a colour change.Gwanfogbe et al. 19; Neba 37. The soil is made up of decomposing crystalline rocks (granite, gneiss, schists, and michachists), or sedimentary rocks in the coastal area. Soils are deep, averaging 10 m., although they are thinner in the north, where rainy seasons are shorter.Neba 37‚Äì8. Ferrous deposits in the soil are quite hard and are used to make bricks.Gwanfogbe et al. 19. Constant leaching of silica by percolating water prevents the soils from being very productive without fertilisation. Climate Yaound√© from Mount Febe The South Cameroon Plateau experiences an equatorial climate of the Guinea subtype.Gwanfogbe et al. 16. The area experiences four seasons each year: two rainy, and two dry. The long dry season is from December to March (or slightly longer in the northern reaches of the plateau),Gwanfogbe et al. 17. the short rainy season from March to June, the short dry season in August, and the long rainy season from September to December. Rainfall averages 1,500‚Äì2,000 mm per year, and precipitation is common even during the dry seasons. However, rainfall is higher near the coast and in the south and diminishes toward the northeast.Gwanfogbe et al. 14. The coastal city Kribi, for example, receives 2,970 mm of rain each year, Moloundou in the southeast gets 1,502 mm, and Yoko gets 1,638 mm. The temperature remains fairly steady year round, averaging 25¬∞C.Neba 29. This fluctuates slightly with the seasons. The long, rainy season is the coldest time of year, and the long dry season is the warmest. Humidity is high year round. Drainage The Dja River Numerous rivers run through the South Cameroon Plateau, particularly in the southeast. These bodies of water drain into both the Atlantic Ocean and the Congo River basin.Gwanfogbe et al. 23. The rivers south of the Sanaga follow an equatorial regime; that is, they reach a high water point during the rainy seasons and a low point during the dry seasons.Gwanfogbe et al. 25. There, rivers such as the Dja, Boumba, and Sangha have carved out valleys. The rivers flow slowly and experience seasonal flooding during the rainy season. The Sanaga and rivers north of it follow a complex, or mixed, Sudano-Guinea regime because the territory they drain lies in both tropical and equatorial climate zones. This means that upstream, they follow a tropical regime, with high water during the long rainy season and low water during the long dry season. However, further south, they receive constant rainfall and flow steadily.Gwanfogbe et al. 25‚Äì6. Flora and fauna Dense vegetation covers the plateau, especially in the south.Neba 31. This includes vast tracts of rainforest, which grows in three or four strata. The tallest trees are straight with buttress roots and stand about 40 m tall. Below these stand thinner, shorter trees with large concentrations of leaves at their tops. The bottom layer is made up of undergrowth of saplings and grasses, although this layer is thin when the larger trees grow close together and block the sunlight.Gwanfogbe et al. 18. Tree species include azob√©, bubinga, ebony, iroko, mahogany, and obeche.Gwanfogbe et al. 18; Neba 33. This primary rainforest exists in the plateau's south and east. Where human activities have affected the forest, for farming, timber, pasture, and urban growth, secondary growth has taken over as the forest has recovered. This is evident around Yaound√©. Forest gradually gives way to Guinean savanna to the north.Neba 33. This consists of vast grasslands punctuated by trees.Neba 34. The savanna has increased as human activities have cut back the forest through activities such as burning.Neba 33‚Äì4. The plateau's rainforests house large numbers of animal species. These include birds, monkeys, and snakes. Others are elephants, chimpanzees, and many rodents. NotesReferences * Gwanfogbe, Mathew, Ambrose Meligui, Jean Moukam, and Jeanette Nguoghia (1983).

It has jurisdiction in respect of criminal and civil matters, as well as a range of administrative matters. The court came into existence in May 2005 and was the result of the amalgamation of the Court of Petty Sessions of Western Australia, Small Claims Tribunal of Western Australia, and the Local Court of Western Australia. History The amalgamation of the three courts followed from recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission of Western Australia. The amalgamation also occurred at a time when changes were made to the appointments of justices of the peace, appointment of magistrates and civil procedure in the state by widening the options available for enforcing bad debts.Second reading speech by WA Attorney General 4 December 2003 The reforms envisaged that the jurisdiction of the court for civil claims would increase from $25,000 to $50,000 as well as the ability for the chief magistrate to establish divisions in the court to deal with specific classes of offenders, such as by establishment of a drug court or a family violence court. Jurisdiction The court is constituted under the Magistrates Court Act 2004 (WA). It is an inferior court and it is also a court of record. The court has a civil jurisdiction under the Magistrates Court (Civil Proceedings) Act 2004 (WA). The court exercises the criminal jurisdiction which a court of petty sessions previously had or which a court of summary jurisdiction could have exercised prior to the creation of the court. The court also deals with cases under the Restraining Orders Act 1997 (WA), the Dividing fences act, Disposal of uncollected goods and extraordinary drivers licence applications. The court can also exercise any jurisdiction conferred upon it. Composition The Governor of Western Australia can appoint magistrates to the court. The governor can also appoint a chief magistrate, as well as deputy chief magistrates. The court normally sits with a magistrate sitting alone. However, the governor may make a regulation which allows a single justice of the peace or two justices of the peace to sit as the court. Caseload About 43,000 civil cases are filed each year in the court.

A grandson of the Kataeb Party founder Pierre Gemayel, Abou Nader became a Kataeb party activist and head of the elite Kataeb troop called the \\"BG\\" and later on head of the Lebanese Forces after the union of various Christian military groupings. After an internal revolt in the Lebanese Forces led by Elie Hobeika and Samir Geagea against his leadership, he relinquished his power to them refusing to what he considered a fratricide venture. Abou Nader remained active in Lebanese Forces veterans group and return briefly to the Kataeb party that was marred at the time by deep divisions between various factions of the party before leaving disenchanted. He eventually established his own political movement, Liberty Front that he heads as general coordinator. He was seriously injured in 1975, 1976 and 1983 in fights against Palestinians and Syrians and in 1986 survived an assassination attempt and was severely wounded. In the late 1980s, he also established his own medical and paramedical engineering firm. Early life Nader was born in Baskinta, (Metn, Mount-Lebanon, Lebanon) on June 27, 1956, a Christian Maronite and the Son of Antoine Abou Nader and Claude Pierre Gemayel. After attending school at Coll√®ge Notre-Dame de Jamhour and Coll√®ge Mont La Salle, he joined the American University of Beirut. Because of the war, he continued his medical studies at the Universit√© Saint-Joseph from which he graduated as a doctor in 1982. Kataeb Party activist He joined the Kataeb Social Democratic Party (led by his grandfather Sheikh Pierre Gemayel) in 1974. He was an active member of both the paramilitary and the students‚Äô organization of the party. At Dekwaneh, he participated in his first fight against the Palestinian organizations. Lebanese Forces fighter and commander When war started, he was part of the elite troop, the ‚ÄúBG‚Äù (or ‚ÄúBE GiM‚Äù), inside of the Kataeb regular forces. When the Kataeb Regulatory Forces (KRF), the Tigers Militia (‚ÄúNoumour‚Äù) from the National Liberal Party, the ‚ÄúGuardians of the Cedars‚Äù from the National Lebanese Movement and the ‚ÄúAl- Tanzim‚Äù (‚Äúthe Organization‚Äù) from the Lebanese Resistance Movement united in the ‚ÄúLebanese Forces‚Äù (LF), he became the head of the operations (called ‚ÄúThird Bureau‚Äù) of the LF. He was seriously injured in 1975, 1976, 1983 and 1986. For the latter, he survived to an assassination attempt and was severely wounded. In 1982, Bachir Gemayel, commander in chief of the LF was elected as Lebanese Republic president. So, Fadi Frem became commander in chief and Dr Fouad Abou Nader, chief of staff of the LF. In 1984, he was elected as commander in chief of the LF. He was involved in almost all the battles with the Resistance against the Palestinian organizations & the Syrian army. He became famous for his tenacious nerves, physical courage, exceptional organization and planning skills. For his fellow fighters he was a living legend: no battle was won without him. He was the initiator & creator of most of the LF elite troops. After his election to the presidency, Bachir Gemayel said: ‚ÄúIf I had to deliver a Resistance medal of honour, I would have certainly given it to the greatest fighter of our Resistance, Fouad Abou Nader.‚Äù Power struggles and withdrawal from the Lebanese Forces From 1985, an era of ‚Äúintifada‚Äù (revolts) shook the ‚Äúfree regions‚Äù and diverted the Cause of its strategic objectives in turning into a struggle for power. Dr Fouad Abou Nader refused the bloody logic: he did not put down the intifada led by Elie Hobeika & Dr Samir Geagea against him: ‚ÄúWhen I offer my condolences to the family of a martyr as head of the LF I feel bad even if their son was sacrificed for the noblest of causes. What do you want me to say tomorrow to all these mothers? How to explain the martyrdom of their children? Just to remain in my position as head of the LF?‚Äù In 1986, he refused the tripartite agreement signed in Damascus by Elie Hobeika and became responsible for the Kataeb regional. Then, in 1989, he refused the Taef agreement signed by Dr Georges Saade, the head of the Kataeb Social Democratic Party and approved by Dr Samir Geagea. He supported Michel Aoun‚Äôs liberation war against the Syrian army but rejected the fratricide war between the Lebanese Army soldiers loyal to General Aoun and Geagea‚Äôs militia. He participated to the mass demonstrations in Baabda (where is located the presidential palace) against Taef agreement and Syrian army invasion. The internal struggles inside of the LF and the fratricide war between Aoun soldiers and Geagea militiamen were fatal: it was real self-destruction. Lebanese Forces Veterans Group and return to Kataeb During Syrian occupation, he helped the student Resistance, participated to their main demonstrations and was part of the \\"Kataeb Opposition\\" led by Dr Elie Karame, former head of the Kataeb, against the pro- Syrian direction of the party led by Dr Georges Saadeh then Mounir Hajj and Karim Pakradouni. After Rafic Hariri assassination, he participated to the mass demonstrations in Beirut downtown for the departure of the Syrian army. After Syrian withdrawal, he restarted his public activities in launching, with his former companions, the \\"Lebanese Forces Veterans Group\\". He decided to return to the Kataeb in the hope of initiating the necessary changes to avoid the repetition of the mistakes of the past. These necessary changes were: making the party more democratic to avoid fratricidal struggles for power and redefining the Cause. Quickly, he clashed with the direction of the party who refused any change about the feudal, hereditary and therefore anti-democratic structures. Establishment of the Liberty Front Consequently, he decided with his companions who come from the Kataeb Social Democratic Party but also from other parties and movements to launch the ‚ÄúLiberty Front‚Äù on April 2007. The Liberty Front is a Lebanese political movement, social-democratic & independent, heir of the ‚ÄúFront for Freedom & Man‚Äù founded in 1976 by Dr. Charles Malik and the political offspring of the Resistance of the Front‚Äôs parties & movements fighters who cooperated in the ‚ÄúLebanese Forces Command Council‚Äù. Starting 1976 before uniting their guns in 1980 in the ‚ÄúLebanese Forces‚Äù under the leadership of President Bachir Gemayel and fought against the Palestinian organizations & the Syrian army between 1975 and 1986. The Liberty Front calls for the Christian unity rejecting the division of the Christians. In October 2008, Abounader was re-elected as general coordinator of the Liberty Front. Positions Dr. Fouad Abou Nader thinks that friendly relations with both Syria and Israel will maybe not start in the near future ‚Äúbut definitely in the end we have to find a resolution. Why can‚Äôt we achieve peace between our countries? Our peace has to be fair between the Israelis and us and between Syria and us as well.‚Äù He is ‚Äú100% for keeping this coexistence between Christians and Muslims in Lebanon, but the political formula of how to implement it must be changed. We would like to find a final solution for the problems of the country. Otherwise we are going to stay in this situation. We cannot go on like this for all of our lives. We have to try a stable solution for the sake of our kids. We don't want our kids to continue the war we have fought. We want to find a final solution. Rule number one is that we have to stop lying to each other. Number two, we have to start thinking Lebanese only. And, rule number three, we need to sit together and find a solution ‚Äì without a hidden agenda from either side. Everyone in Lebanon, Christians, Sunnis, Shiites, Druze, Alawi, Jews, etc. can live free with dignity and enjoy security, equality and freedom.‚Äù About the Memorandum of Understanding between Aoun‚Äôs Free Patriotic Movement & Hezbollah, his position is: ‚ÄúIt's a positive step although I don't agree with the objectives of Hezbollah and its foreign agenda.‚Äù As ‚Äúdefence strategy‚Äù option, he is for the creation of a ‚Äúnational guard‚Äù, an armed force organised regionally, in the framework of the regionalism he is calling for, alongside the Lebanese army and Interior Security Forces (I.S.F.) and integrating Hezbollah Resistance weapons and fighters but also other and new volunteers from all the regions and from all the sects. Other activities Abou Nader is chairman of Tanit Paramedic and Tanit Medical Engineering. Tanit was established in 1987. It is a trading and distributing company specialized in the medical field. It has developed an extensive network of connections in many parts of the world such as Nigeria. Tanit represents several international manufacturers of medical equipment and supplies and specialized consultant companies in the medical field.

During this period Li Yan established himself as useful attacking midfielder and caught the eye of New Zealand Knights FC in 2006, however his move was to prove an unsuccessful one and he only played in two league games. Li Yan would return to Xian Chanba which had renamed itself Shaanxi Baorong in the 2007 season and stayed with them until the end of the 2009 league season when he transferred to Hangzhou Greentown in 2010. His move to Hangzhou would see him become an immediate regular within the team and he helped guide the club to their best ever finish of fourth within the league as well qualification for the AFC Champions League for the first time. Li would, however sustain an ankle injury at the beginning of the 2011 league season and tried to play on until April 19, 2011 in a 2011 AFC Champions League group game against Al Ain S.C.C. saw him unable to carry on, which would see him retire soon afterwards. International career Li Yan would make his debut in a friendly against Republic of Ireland March 29, 2005 in a 1‚Äì0 defeat. He would go on to establish himself as a squad regular within the team and score his first goal against Korea DPR in a 2‚Äì0 win. Li Yan, however did not make it into the squad that went to the 2007 AFC Asian Cup and after the tournament saw very little international playing time.

Since retiring he would move in to management where he gained his first Head coaching position with Wuhan Zall. Club career=Early career As with all the most promising young Chinese players Zheng Bin would quickly be included in the short-lived Chinese national youth team program to study football abroad in a training programme sponsored by Jianlibao and called the Chinese Jianlibao Youth Football Team. After graduating through the Jianlibao Youth Team he would return to his hometown to play for Wuhan Hongjinlong to start his professional football career. In his debut season he would play six games in his debut season. He would then go on to play in the majority of Wuhan's games throughout the 1999 league season that saw the team relegated. Shenzhen Jianlibao The following seasons would see him remain with Wuhan in their attempts to return to the top tier until Shenzhen Jianlibao's Head coach Zhu Guanghu showed an interest within him. Zheng Bin would eventually join Shenzhen Jianlibao at the beginning of the 2003 league season. The move would immediately become very successful for him when he quickly established himself within the team in his debut season and then in his second season help the team to win the 2004 Chinese Super League title. Return to Wuhan Despite just winning the league title with Shenzhen Jianlibao the club had many financial difficulties and when his previous club just having won promotion and offering 3,500,000 RMB for the return of his services Zheng Bin would immediately rejoin them. Once again this turned out to be a successful transfer for him when he once again settled straight away within the team and this time go on to win the 2005 Chinese Super League Cup. He would soon go on to captain the team until the club controversially disbanded for what they believed was unfair punishment by the Chinese Football Association after the club's management did not accept the punishment given to them by the Chinese Football Association after a scuffle broke out during a league game against Beijing Guoan on September 27, 2008.

He was the son of Peter Beckford, founder of one of the most powerful families on the island, and briefly acting governor of the colony. Like his father, Beckford junior suffered a severe temper. As a young man, he was accused of killing the Deputy Judge Advocate of Jamaica in a fit of temper, but was acquitted after a lengthy court case. Peter junior joined the House of Assembly of Jamaica and became the Speaker. During a debate in 1710, things became extremely heated and some members drew their swords and threatened him. The Governor responded to shouts for assistance and the doors of the chamber were forced open. The Assembly was dissolved in the name of the Queen. The aged Peter Beckford senior was amongst those who had come to his rescue. In the general confusion, he slipped and fell down the long staircase. Suffering a mortal injury, he died soon after. In 1720, Peter junior was one of the prominent people in Jamaica about whom the governor Sir Nicholas Lawes complained had \\"anarchical principles\\". He went into business with Alexander Grant, leasing a storehouse from which the partners sold supplies to other plantation owners. Peter married Bathshua Herring and they had thirteen children, including William, who was twice Lord Mayor of London, and Elizabeth, who became Countess of Effingham. He died in 1735. His will included a legacy of ¬£2,000 to found a school in Spanish Town, then the capital of Jamaica, which was started there in 1744. This school merged with another school started with ¬£3,000 donated by Francis Smith forming the Beckford and Smith School in 1869. At his death, much of Beckford's personal property took the form of black slaves, of whom he was sole owner of 1737 and half owner of 577 others. His son William was born in 1709. William emigrated to England and had a prominent career in politics, defending the West India Interest, i.e. lobbying against the abolition of slavery, first as a Member of Parliament and then as Lord Mayor of London.

History Weston Ltd 276x276px Weston Aerodrome was founded in 1931 (licensed circa 1937) by Darby Kennedy (1915-2016), a \\"founding father of aviation\\" in Ireland who, from 1946, operated a de Havilland Dragon and several Dragon Rapide aircraft commercially from the Weston flying field, operated under the name Weston Ltd. The charter flights took the biplane airliners to airfields across the United Kingdom. The commercial flight operation ceased in the late 1950s.Merton Jones A.C., British Independent Airlines since 1946, Merseyside Aviation Society, 1977; . and Weston Ltd continued as a training provider for private and commercial licences. Darby Kennedy, pilot's licence no. 15, was chief instructor, and also became chief pilot of Aer Lingus, Ireland's flag- carrier airline. In 1988, Capt. Kennedy was presented with a crystal memento by Irish President Patrick Hillery, at a ceremony to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the airfield. During the event, which was recorded by RTE television, President Hillery took to the air in a replica of the de Havilland DH84 Dragon \\"Iolar\\" (Eagle) which flew Aer Lingus's first ever flight, from Dublin (Baldonnel) to Bristol in 1936. 413x413px Also operated from the airfield was a flying school, Leinster Aero Clubhttp://www.leinsteraeroclub.com/ for private pilots with several de Havilland Tiger Moth trainer biplanes, an Auster 5J/1 Autocrat high-wing monoplane and from 1960 two Morane-Saulnier-Rallye four-seater low-winged aeroplanes. The club now operates one training aircraft, a Robin HR 200 EI- YLG, which is fully IFR equipped. The airport was upgraded from a grass runway in the 1980s when a tarmac runway was laid. The main terminal was completed in 2005 along with the control tower and other services. Developed over many years by Jim Mansfield, the airport was taken over by the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) in 2011.NAMA's Weston airport starting to turn around as buyer sought, Irish Independent, 20 September 2011. In 2013 the airport was sold by NAMA to Brian Conneely and Co, who announced plans to \\"upgrade the radar system and buildings, with a focus on aviation education courses and innovative projects which... could attract enterprise funding.\\" Conneely and Co said they were hopeful the sale would ‚Äúmark a turning point‚Äù in Irish aviation, and act as a ‚Äúsign of optimism‚Äù for the economy, and they were ‚Äúdelighted‚Äù with the purchase due to its ‚Äúproud tradition in Irish aviation‚Äù. In January 2014 Transport Minister Leo Varadkar TD launched the new Coast Guard Sikorsky S92 helicopter for the East Coast region at Weston Airport. The airport owner announced it was in talks with Kildare and Dublin councils and local groups about providing a walk-way and park and they were \\"looking into several potential uses for some of the beautiful riverside parkland for sports and walkways in conjunction with the local community and sports clubs.\\" Today In 2015, over 40 aircraft were based at Weston. The airport has 15 direct employees with another 100 indirect jobs arising from airport tenancies and related activities, and over two hundred professional and private pilots are in current training (Dec 2019) . The airport is a staging point for aircraft displaying in the annual Bray Air Display. Popular culture Several air displays have been held at the airport, and in 1966 Weston was used in filming the World War I air combat film, The Blue Max. The aircraft ground scenes were shot at the airfield, which is not to be confused with RAF Weston-on-the-Green, in England, which has no tarmac runway. It was also used for filming 1971's \\"Von Richthofen and Brown\\": Richard Bach, author of Jonathan Livingstone Seagull, was one of the film's stunt pilots, and wrote about some of his experiences at Weston during its production.Richard Bach, \\"I Shot Down the Red Baron, and So What\\" in \\"A Gift of Wings\\", Dell Reissue 1989, First edition 1974; Kindle pp. 23, 27 and 29 In 2018, author Bob Montgomery published In Weston Skies: A personal memoir of flying at Weston in the 1950s.

History=Eastgate development The Eastgate shopping centre was first opened in the city centre by Sun Alliance in January 1983. Eastgate refurbishment Interior view of the shopping centre The Eastgate shopping centre underwent a refurbishment plan in 1993. The first application sent to Highland Council by the centre developers Royal & SunAlliance, dated 10 March 1997, was to warrant a much needed extension to the Eastgate. This plan was originally rejected on the grounds of the controversial re-location of the Category B listed building on 7/9 Falcon Square (the Falconer Building), inadequate access to the railway station and too many car park spaces that would allow for this development to go ahead. They were more interested in supporting plans particularly around The Academy Centre extension which was going to be anchored by Debenhams. The plans outlined were going to contain two new bridges connecting the existing centre and the new extension. This was going to be built on land (Millburn Road), north of the centre on the former Railway goods yard area. Marks and Spencer were going to expand their current store over their own service yard. A car park would be built for the extension holding 1500, which was later forced to scale back, creating 1350 spaces across the two centre car parks. BHS anticipated an interest in being an anchor for the new extension, which also included including room for leisure facility and an 8 screen multiplex cinema. A later application was accepted, although now without a multiplex cinema. The listed building was moved brick- by-brick to the other side of Falcon Square, and now hosts Pizza Express and Laura Ashley. Building work started in 2001 and was opened in 2003. This new development included two bridge walkways connecting the new phase with the existing shopping centre, complete with Debenhams as the anchor store, and a new food court. The expansion of Eastgate and the construction of the Falcon Mall was deemed one of 'the most impressive planning projects in Scotland in recent years' and was the overall winner of the Scottish Awards for Quality in Planning 2003. The Falcon Square extension is called the Falcon Mall. The original site is now officially called Eastgate Mall, with Eastgate Centre referring to the two buildings together. As part of this refurbishment, Falcon Square has been rebuilt as a plaza on which a new mercat cross has been erected, and which has replaced the Town House end of the High Street as a gathering point for civic events. Stores As of May 2019, stores include Boots, Debenhams, Fat Face, H&M;, HMV, New Look, Next and Waterstones. While the food court is currently undergoing refurbishment, it hosts a new cafe Tartan Tapas. Throughout the centre, there are other food options such as Costa Coffee, Starbucks, and Archie's Cafe, where food is provided by Cobbs Bakery in aid of the Archie Foundation. Plans are underway to expand the food court, and open it up to keep up with modern food court trends.  Culture  The Eastgate Centre is notable for an automation clock, which depicts Noah's Ark. This clock is popular among tourists and locals. The clock is one of only six of its kind in the UK. The food court in Falcon Mall is home to The Falcon's Return, a statue depicting James IV of Scotland holding a falcon, as James IV was one of Scotland's celebrated Falconers. The statue also celebrates the name of the Falcon Ironworks that originally stood on the site of the Eastgate expansion, which gave its name to Falcon Square. The sculpture was created by local artist Leonie Gibbs. The Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, was present at the unveiling ceremony, and she and Gibbs are cousins.

In 2006 Baker was inducted into the West Australian Music Industry Hall of Fame. The following year, Hoodoo Gurus were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. Biography=Early days Baker grew up in Fremantle, Western Australia, with family roots stretching back in the port city for generations. His father played reserves for the East Fremantle Football Club.Gorman, Sean; Whish- Wilson, David (2017). Derby: WA Footy Fans on the Game's Greatest Rivalry. Fremantle Press, . In May 2003 Baker told Sylvester Fox of Groove Magazine about his first drumming gig, \\"I was in a Beatles covers band. I saw Ringo Starr and I said I want to do that.\\" Baker named Ronnie Bond of the Troggs as his main drumming influence. He then drummed for Black Sun (1973‚Äì74), which played original material. He followed with the Slick City Boys (1974‚Äì75). In 1976 he travelled to the United States and then England, where he saw early live performances by the Ramones, Flamin' Groovies, the Dictators and Johnny Thunders. Baker described a chance encounter: Baker considered auditioning for the Clash: In 1977 Baker was a member of protopunk band, Beheaded/the Geeks, alongside Ross Buncle on guitar, Rudolph V (aka Dave Cardwell) on bass guitar and Lloyd on vocals. They were one of the first punk rock groups in Perth, although they played no gigs and did not release any recorded material at that time. Baker's \\"powerful, furious drumming was legendary around Perth.\\" After Dave Faulkner (aka Dave Flick) joined on lead vocals and guitar, the band became known as the Victims. Baker and Faulkner co-wrote their first single, \\"Television Addict\\" (1977). It has appeared on several punk compilations; and according to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, it \\"consolidated their fierce live reputation\\" and is \\"one of the first Australian punk singles.\\" The Scientists In May 1978 Baker joined another Perth-based punk rock band, the Invaders, with Kim Salmon on guitar and vocals; Roddy Radalj on guitar and vocals; and Boris Sujdovic on bass guitar. He replaced their original drummer, John Rowlings and they were renamed the Scientists. Sujdovic left in August 1978 and they did not resume performing until January 1979 with Dennis Byrne on bass guitar. The band released its first single in April 1979, \\"Frantic Romantic\\", on the DNA label. Radalj and Byrne had left in that month, and were replaced by Ben Juniper on guitar and Ian Sharples on bass guitar. This line-up recorded the band's four-track extended play, The Scientists (released February 1980). McFarlane declared that \\"Frantic Romantic\\" and The Scientists EP are some of \\"the most collectable artefacts of the Australian punk rock era.\\" The group toured the Australian east coast during December 1979 and again in February‚ÄìMarch 1980; they also appeared on ABC-TV's pop music show, Countdown, performing \\"Last Night\\" from their EP. Juniper left in May 1980 and Baker, Salmon and Sharples continued as a three-piece. The band broke up in January 1981 after recording their debut self-titled album, The Scientists (commonly referred to as The Pink Album), which was released in August of that year via White Rider/EMI. The Scientists reformed in September, without Baker. Hoodoo Gurus In January 1981 Baker, Faulkner and Radalj joined Kimble Rendall (ex-XL Capris), on guitar and vocals, as founders of Sydney‚Äìbased band, Le Hoodoo Gurus (later renamed Hoodoo Gurus). This resulted from: Rendall left in 1982 just prior to the release of their debut single, \\"Leilani\\" (October), and was replaced by Clyde Bramley on bass guitar and backing vocals from Sydney bands, The Hitmen and Super K. Radalj was next to leave the band as he was unhappy with Rendall's leaving and Faulkner's greater influence on the band's direction. He was replaced by ex-Fun Things guitarist, Brad Shepherd, who had been Bramley's flatmate and in The Hitmen and Super K. Gurus new line-up of Baker, Bramley, Faulkner and Shepherd recorded the band's first album, Stoneage Romeos (March 1984), Baker co-wrote two tracks. Baker and Shepherd was also in a side project, Beasts of Bourbon. In August as Hoodoo Gurus were \\"riding its first wave of success, Baker was sacked amid a blaze of ill-feeling.\\" Shepherd, in turn, was sacked from Beast of Bourbon. Hoodoo Gurus iconic status on the Australian rock scene was acknowledged when they were inducted into the 2007 ARIA Hall of Fame. Beasts of Bourbon Baker joined the Beasts of Bourbon in September 1983, together with Tex Perkins (ex-the Dum-Dums), Spencer P. Jones (the Johnnys), and former band mates Salmon and Sujdovic of the Scientists. That group were formed by vocalist Perkins to fulfil bookings, which his previous band could not meet. This line-up was featured on the band's first album, The Axeman's Jazz(July 1984), recorded in a single afternoon in the previous October for $100, by producer, Tony Cohen. McFarlane opined that the album, \\"remains a classic of Australian garage/swamp rock. It was the best-selling Australian alternative album for 1984. It also went on to sell over 30 000 copies in Europe.\\" In mid-1984 when the Scientists (with Salmon and Sujdovic aboard) left Australia to tour overseas the Beasts of Bourbon line-up of Baker, Jones and Perkins were joined by Shepherd and Stu Spasm on bass guitar (ex-Zulu Rattle, Salamander Jim) for their national Sultans of Swig tour. After Baker was fired from Hoodoo Gurus and Shepherd was fired from Beasts of Bourbon, Spasm moved to rhythm guitar and Graham Hood (from the Johnnys) joined on bass guitar. Although the album became an underground success (a cover of \\"Psycho\\" being a hit on alternative radio), the band went into hiatus after the tour. Baker provided lead vocals and drums for a single: a cover of the Troggs' track, \\"I Can't Control Myself\\" (June 1985), with an original, \\"Born to Be Punched\\" as its B-side. It was credited to the James Baker Experience, which comprised Baker, Perkins, Radalj and Spasm, and appeared via Red Eye Records with Mark Callaghan producing. When both the Johnnys and the Scientists disbanded Beasts of Bourbon reunited in 1987 as Baker, Jones, Perkins, Salmon and Sujdovic. They recorded another album, Sour Mash (December 1988), with Phil Punch as producer and audio engineer. The swamp-rock of The Axeman's Jazz had given way to a fusion of blues-based pub rock and punk with great effect. McFarlane declared that it \\"virtually redefined the parameters of guitar-based rock'n'roll. The Cramps-influenced swamp-rock of old had been discarded for a more adventurous slab of gutbucket blues and avant-garde weirdness. Perkins' voice had matured into an authentic blues growl that showed the influence of Howlin' Wolf, Captain Beefheart and Tom Waits.\\" Black Milk (July 1990), their next album expanded on this idea. The band grew confident and powerful while touring Europe on the back of Sour Mash and grew in popularity. Early in 1991 Baker and Sujdovic left to be replaced by Brian Hooper on bass guitar and Tony Pola on drums ‚Äì both from Salmon's new band, the Surrealists. The Dubrovniks and beyond In 1988 Baker joined another group, the Dubrovniks, alongside Radalj and Sujdovic together with Peter Simpson on guitar and vocals (ex-Teeny Weenies, Super K, Spectre's Revenge, Hoi Polloi). The band's name was used as Radalj and Sujdovic were both born in the Croatian town of Dubrovnik. They released several albums: Dubrovnik Blues (August 1989), Audio Sonic Love Affair (September 1990), Chrome (June 1992) and Medicine Wheel (1994). After they broke up in 1995 Baker returned to Perth. On 10 February 1995, the 1980s line-up of the Scientists: Baker, Juniper, Salmon and Sharples, reformed for a one-off show in Perth. Baker's later projects included Rockin' Hendy (with Rik van der Velde on guitar, and Lou Boy on bass guitar and vocals) and the Painkillers. Baker formed the Painkillers in May 2005 together with Joe Bludge on guitar and vocals.

In May 1898, when serious riots arising from high food prices broke out in Milan, the Italian government under Antonio di Rudin√¨ declared a state of siege in the city. General Bava Beccaris, as extraordinary commissar of the city, ordered his soldiers to fire on demonstrators, who had erected several barricades during a strike. Artillery was also used. According to official figures 80 people were killed and 450 wounded. However actual deaths may have been twice those recorded. In recognition of his action Bava Beccaris received the Great Cross of the Order of Savoy from King Umberto I in June 1898. He was shortly afterwards appointed to the Italian Senate.From Italian senate website personal page During 1914, he warmly supported the interventionist party in Italy who wished to participate in World War I, (as they did on 25 May 1915). In 1922, he recommended that King Victor Emmanuel III grant power to Benito Mussolini and the National Fascist Party. Bava Beccaris retired in 1902. He died in Rome in 1924.

It also appeared in an original Doctor Who novel, Twilight of the Gods, one of the Virgin Missing Adventures range. and an audio drama, Return to the Web Planet, produced by Big Finish Productions. The popularity of The Web Planet meant that two of the species inhabiting Vortis, the ant-like Zarbi and the butterfly Menoptra, appeared twice in the 1966 Doctor Who Annual. One story, \\"Lair of the Zarbi Supremo\\" by David Whitaker, was released as an audio feature on the 2006 DVD release of the original adventure, read by one of its stars, William Russell. Fictional history of Vortis The planet appears to be cold, dark and lifeless, but nevertheless supports a breathable atmosphere, water and presumably food. Before the sinister Animus took control of the planet, Vortis was covered in a flower forest, which the Menoptra hoped would return.According to the Menoptra, Prapillus: \\"The Menoptra have no wisdom for war. Before the Animus came, the flower forest covered the planet in a cocoon of peace.\\" The Web Planet. Many years later after the Animus was apparently vanquished, Vortis drifted into the neighboring Rhumos system and was fought over by the Rhumons, who considered it a disputed territory. The Animus had also survived, until the intervention of a time traveller once more brought peace to the troubled world. Species of Vortis=Menoptra Resembling giant, humanoid butterflies and able to achieve space flight with their wings alone, the Menoptra were the original masters of Vortis until the Animus inveigled itself within the minds of the Zarbi. The Menoptra fled to Pictos, one of the moons of Vortis, eventually planning an invasion. Those that were captured were either killed or forced to work, once their wings had been removed by the Zarbi. That their attempt to retake their home world was a success was largely down to the efforts of the aforementioned party of time travellers. Optera In an apparent example of emerging speciation, some of the Menoptra fled underground, adapting to a subterranean environment and calling themselves the Optera. This species have lost the ability to fly, and resemble upright caterpillars, indicating that they had evolved through neoteny. They also have larger eyes than their Menoptra brethren. However, they have numerous arms and appear to 'hop' in a stylised way. With the Animus defeated, they appeared to believe that future generations of Optera would redevelop flight. Venom Grubs Unlike the other bipedal species of Vortis, Venom Grubs crawl along the ground. They were used as mobile weapons by the Zarbi, able to shoot venom from their snouts that proved fatal to all it touched. The Grubs were rendered harmless once the Zarbi were freed from the Animus's influence. Venom Grubs were mentioned in the 2005 episode Boom Town, where it is implied that they are used to punish disobedient Slitheen. Zarbi The Zarbi resemble giant ants, and according to the Menoptra have been used as cattle in the planet's history. These insectoids lack intelligence, and so were easily enslaved by the malevolent Animus and used against the Menoptra. When the Animus's evil influence was lifted through the intervention of a mysterious time traveller and his human companions, the Zarbi returned to their docile state. According to the novelisation of The Web Planet, the Zarbi reproduce through the \\"Zarbi Supremo\\", who acts like a queen bee. The Supremo also appeared in the 1966 Doctor Who Annual.

The inaugural chlorine attacks in Iraq were described as poorly executed, probably because much of the chemical agent was rendered nontoxic by the heat of the accompanying explosives. Subsequent, more refined, attacks resulted in hundreds of injuries, but have proven not to be a viable means of inflicting massive loss of life. Their primary impact has therefore been to cause widespread panic, with large numbers of civilians suffering non life-threatening, but nonetheless highly traumatic, injuries. Chlorine was used as a poison gas in World War I, but was delivered by artillery shell, unlike the modern stationary or car bombs. Still, its function as a weapon in both instances is similar. Low level exposure results in burning sensations to the eyes, nose and throat, usually accompanied by dizziness, nausea and vomiting. Higher levels of exposure can cause fatal lung damage; but because the gas is heavier than air it will not dissipate until well after an explosion, it is generally considered ineffective as an improvised chemical weapon.  Western media linking chlorine attacks to 'al Qaeda'  In February 2007, a U.S. military spokesman said that ‚Äòal Qaeda propaganda material‚Äô had been found at a factory for chlorine chemical weapons in Karma, east of Fallujah, which led press agency Reuters to the conclusion that that ‚Äúchlorine bomb factory was al Qaeda's‚Äù.

Besides via oral tradition, it was preserved early in written form through Ge'ez manuscripts. This philosophy occupies a unique position within African philosophy. Beginnings of Ethiopian philosophy The character of Ethiopian philosophy is determined by the particular conditions of evolution of the Ethiopian culture. Thus, Ethiopian philosophy arises from the confluence of Greek and Patristic philosophy with traditional Ethiopian modes of thought. Because of the early isolation from its sources of Abrahamic spirituality ‚Äì Byzantium and Alexandria ‚Äì Ethiopia received some of its philosophical heritage through Arabic versions. The sapiential literature developed under these circumstances is the result of a twofold effort of creative assimilation: on one side, of a tuning of Orthodoxy to traditional modes of thought (never eradicated), and vice versa, and, on the other side, of absorption of Greek pagan and early Patristic thought into this developing Ethiopian-Christian synthesis. As a consequence, the moral reflection of religious inspiration is prevalent, and the use of narrative, parable, apothegm and rich imagery is preferred to the use of abstract argument. This sapiential literature consists in translations and adaptations of some Greek texts, namely of the Physiolog (cca. 5th century A.D.), The Life and Maxims of Skendes (11th century A.D.) and The Book of the Wise Philosophers (1510/22). Mature Ethiopian philosophy In the 17th century, the religious beliefs of Ethiopians were challenged by King Suseynos' adoption of Catholicism, and by a subsequent presence of Jesuit missionaries. The attempt to forcefully impose Catholicism upon his constituents during Suseynos' reign inspired further development of Ethiopian philosophy during the 17th century. Zera Yacob (1599‚Äì1692) is the most important exponent of this renaissance. His treatise Hatata (1667) is a work often included in the narrow canon of universal philosophy. Zera Yacob Zera Yacob had a culture entirely theological. Although of humble birth, he earned respect for his intellectual capacities, and went on to pursue the traditional Ethiopian theological education. Zera Yacob mastered Coptic theology and Catholic theology, and he had extensive knowledge of Jewish and Islamic religions. His spiritual vade mecum was David‚Äôs Book of Psalms, in which he sought comfort and inspiration. Knowing thus two Christian interpretations of the Bible, as well as the two other Abrahamic religions, and seeing the contradictions between them, Zera Yacob is led to refuse the authority of the Ethiopian tradition and of any tradition in general. He comes to think that the tradition is infested by lies, because men, in their arrogance, believe that they know everything and thus refuse to examine things with their own mind, blindly accepting what has been transmitted to them by their forefathers. The philosopher accepts then as unique authority his reason, and accepts from the Scriptures and from the dogmas only what resists a rational inquiry. He affirms that the human reason can find the truth, if it searches it and does not get discouraged in front of the difficulties. Thus, by his piece-meal examination (this is what hat√§t√§ means), Zera Yacob arrives at an argument for the existence of God (an essence uncreated and eternal), based on the impossibility of an infinite chain of causes, and at the conviction that the Creation is good, because God is good. This belief is the basis for a criticism of ascetic morals and of some Jewish and Islamic moral precepts as well. By identifying the will of God with what is rational Zera Yacob rejects most of these moral precepts (e.g. concerning polygamy, or fasting, or sexual or alimentary interdictions) as blasphemy. He seems to think that all is good for the good one, reminding thus of the mode of thought expressed in the profession of faith of the other great Zera Yaqob, the Emperor from the 15th century. Walda Heywat Zera Yacob had a disciple, Walda Heywat, who also wrote a philosophical treatise, systematising his master‚Äôs thought. He accorded more attention to the practical and educational problems, and he tried to connect Zera Yacob‚Äôs philosophy with the kind of wisdom expressed in the earlier sapiential literature. Walda Heywat recurs intensively to illustrations and parables, and many times the source of his examples is the Book of the Wise Philosophers. Although his work is arguably less original than that of his master's, it can be considered \\"more Ethiopian\\", since it represents a synthesis through which some ideas engendered by Zera Yacob's rejection of tradition are brought together with traditional Christian- inspired wisdom. It is \\"more Ethiopian\\" also in the sense that it addresses some practical, social and moral issues that most Ethiopians of his time encountered in their lives. Thus, Walda Heywat's work is less speculative, but more national in character than the treatise of his master, Zera Yacob.

It has made significant contributions to the region by cultivating a strong exhibitions program bringing in artists both national and international, and through its expansive arts in education programs. History The Flood Gallery and Fine Arts Center is housed inside the Historical Phil Mechanic Studios Building (circa 1923). It was built originally as the Pierce-Young-Angel Food Storage Warehouse located near the French Broad River and Norfolk Southern Railroad in the industrial area currently known as the River Arts District. The Mechanic family purchased the building in the 70's, and it became a construction company. When Phil Mechanic died in the late 1990s, his son, Mitch Mechanic, inherited the building. Mitch and his wife, Jolene, converted the building into ateliers, or art studio spaces. After a massive upgrade to bring the 90-year-old building up to city code compliance, the place became Phil Mechanic Studios. In 2005, Jolene Mechanic, and popular local artist Sean \\"Jinx\\" Pace, collaborated and became co-founders and created the non-profit Flood Gallery and Fine Art Center. The Flood Gallery Fine Arts Center is currently directed by Carlos Steward the Editor in Chief of the Black Mountain Press. Today, Phil Mechanic Studios has become a hub for art and science. They currently house two art galleries ‚Äì the Flood Gallery and the Pump Gallery showcasing an ambitious exhibitions program for both local artists as well as national and international artists; artist studios, and a library featuring more than 1,000 books and films and internet capability for the artists in residence. In 2017 they moved to 850 Blue Ridge Rd in Black Mountain East of Asheville, NC. Exhibitions The Flood Fine Arts Center opened its exhibition space in 2005, with international artist H.K. Zamani (a.k.a. Habib Kheradyar Zamani). Zamani has shown his work in Prague, the Czech Republic; Lublin, Poland; Graz, Austria; Frankfurt, Germany; Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Bangkok, Thailand; London, England; and now resides in Los Angeles, California where he shows work regularly. In the past five years, The Flood Fine Arts Center has hosted other internationally acclaimed artists including Jim Buonaccorsi, Nava Lubelski, Mike Estabrook, Cory Bradley, Mike Calway-Fagen, Allen Leper Hampton, Porge Buck, Heinz Kossler, and James Esber.

He coached South Melbourne for the 1932 season, taking it to its first finals campaign in almost a decade. He is credited with laying the groundwork for the \\"foreign legion\\" team which won the 1933 VFL premiership, recruiting leading WANFL players such as his Subiaco teammates Brighton Diggins and Bill Faul. Returning to Perth in 1933 for employment, he embarked on a further successful coaching period. He steered West Perth Football Club to successive premierships in 1934 and 1935. Leonard was asked to return to South Melbourne at the end of 1936,Main, Jim; The Encyclopedia of AFL Coaches: Every AFL/VFL Coach Since 1904; p. 133 but business prevented him moving to Victoria. Staying in Perth, Leonard coached West Perth for another season, and then moved to coach a highly talented Claremont team to three consecutive premierships. After World War II, Leonard was again appointed as Claremont coach for the 1946 season after no one else could be found, but business commitments meant he had to leave most of the work to deputy Jack Reeves and the Tigers won only three matches.Casey, Kevin; The Tigers‚Äô Tale: the origins and history of the Claremont Football Club; p. 58 Seven years later, Leonard was asked at the age of fifty to re-take the coaching reins at South Melbourne, but his business in a football-making factory took up all of his time and he could not accept.Main; The Encyclopedia of AFL Coaches, p. 157 Leonard was inducted to the Australian Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1996 ‚Äì one year after his death.  Other interests  Leonard was a highly respected Perth businessman following his football career. In April 1946, he played a key role in orchestrating the first meeting that led to the formation of the Western Australian Basketball Association. He served as the Association President for the first two years and the local associations played for the John Leonard Perpetual Shield in the winter competition.

Not to be confused with modern digital formats and processing, they are yet to be developed as a mature technology, having been experimented with extensively by Bell Labs as far back as the 1920s, but not realized as commercial products. Principle of operation The least significant bit drives a tiny speaker driver, of whatever physical design is chosen; a value of \\"1\\" causes this driver to be driven full amplitude, a value of \\"0\\" causes it to be off. This allows for high efficiency in the amplifier, which at any time is either passing zero current, or required to drop the output voltage by zero volts, therefore in a theoretical ideal amplifier dissipating no power as heat at any time. The next least significant bit drives a speaker of twice the area (most often, but not necessarily, a ring around the previous driver), again to either full amplitude, or off. The next least significant bit drives a speaker of twice this area, and so on. Other approaches are possible. For example, instead of doubling the area of the next most significant diaphragm segment, it could simply be driven so it stroked twice as far. The digital principle of operation and attendant amplifier efficiency benefits would remain. With the advent of smaller transducer size using manufacture process such as CMOS-MEMS. A more practical approach is to construct an array of speakers, known as Digital Loudspeaker Array (DLA) or Digital Transducer Array (DTA). The least significant bit will be represented by a single transducer, and the amount will double for the next least significant bit. A n-bits speaker arrays will consist of 2n-1 transducers, and the mth bits of said arrays will contain 2m-1 transducers. The entire array basically function as a thermometer-coded DAC that can decode PCM signal of same number of bits as the array into sound wave. Bit grouping or PWM encoding are potential ways to decode 1-bit delta-sigma modulated signal such as DSD. Problems Although digital speakers can function, there are various problems with this design which make it impractical for any normal uses at present. Size For the number of bits required for high quality sound reproduction, the size of the system becomes impractically large. For example, for a 16-bit system with the same bit depth as the 16-bit audio CD standard, starting with a 0.5 cm¬≤ driver for the least significant bit would require a total area for the driver array of 32,000 cm¬≤, or over 34 square feet (3.2 m¬≤). Ultrasonic output To work properly, all of the individual diaphragm elements would have to operate cleanly at the clock frequency. The natural frequency response of the various elements will vary with their size. This creates a DAC where the various bits have different bandpass characteristics. Large short-term errors can be expected. Since this system is converting digital signal to analog, the effect of aliasing is unavoidable, so that the audio output is \\"reflected\\" at equal amplitude in the frequency domain, on the other side of the sampling frequency. One solution would be to overclock the conversion elements, introduce a digital filter and follow them with an acoustical low pass filter. Even accounting for the vastly lower efficiency of speaker drivers at such high frequencies, the result was to generate an unacceptably high level of ultrasonics accompanying the desired output. In electronic digital to analog conversion, this is addressed by the use of low- pass filters to eliminate the spurious upper frequencies produced. Since these frequencies are eliminated in the electrical signal, they are not passed to the speaker and thus ultrasonic airwaves are not generated. However, electronic filtering is inherently unable to solve this problem with the digital loudspeaker. The speaker elements must operate ultrasonically to avoid introducing (high levels of) audible artifacts, and this means ultrasonic airwaves are inevitable. Electronics can filter electrical signals, but can not remove ultrasonic frequencies already in the air. Efficiency Although amplifier efficiency is good with this system, moving coil speakers operate at relatively low efficiency in the ultrasonic frequency region. Thus the original aim of the method is defeated. Cost The large number of speaker drivers in the array, and the equally large number of amplifier channels to drive them makes for a pricey system. Improvements There are ways to tackle the above issues, but none lead to a competitive or even issue free system. Size System size can be easily made practical by using less than 16 bits. With a 0.5 cm¬≤ LSB, system sizes are: * 8 bit: 128 cm¬≤ total array area, or 11.3 cm x 11.3 cm (apx 4.5 inches x 4.5 inches) * 10 bit: 22.6 cm x 22.6 cm array size. A larger number of bits can be accommodated in a given space by varying the throw of the different elements as well as their area. This can achieve a magnitude or more of area improvement for a given bit depth. One could fit a 13 bit array into a square foot, or a 16 bit array into . Ultrasonics A passive air coupled diaphragm fitted over the array of digital drivers can act as a mechanical low pass filter. However, a sharp frequency cutoff is impossible, so significant ultrasonics would still be present. Multiple passive diaphragms could improve this, but would never remove all ultrasonics, and only add further to the system's already high cost and complexity. Intractable problems The complexity and thus cost are both high compared to standard moving coil speakers. The efficiency of speakers operated at ultrasonic frequencies is low, wiping out any efficiency gain in the amplifier. Practical speakers demand production of fairly high volumes from fairly small cabinets, a combination that is difficult to achieve using ultrasonic speaker drivers. Full removal of ultrasonic output is impractical. The large number of required speaker and amplifier elements reduces system reliability significantly Other more modern approaches to high efficiency, particularly class D amplification, work much better and at much lower cost than digital speakers. Future Development=Microelectromechanical systems In recent years, there had been research on the topic of construction of digital loudspeaker arrays in Digital Sound Reconstruction system using Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). MEMS microspeaker arrays can be manufactured onto a chip using a CMOS process. A single chip system will have less variations between each subunit compare to a multi-chip system. CMOS-MEMS process reduce the size of each subunit to a few hundred Œºm in diameter. Speakers marketed as digital Modern speakers marketed as 'digital' are always analog speakers, in most cases driven by an analog amplifier. The widespread use of the term 'digital' with speakers is a marketing ploy intended to claim better suitability with 'digital' source material (e.g., MP3 recordings), or impute 'higher technology' than some other speaker, and perhaps higher price. If pressed, manufacturers may claim the term means the product is 'ready' for input from digital players; this is true of essentially all speaker systems. There are also a minority of Class D and Class T digital amplifier driven analog speakers, though these are not normally found in separate computer speakers or home stereo systems. These are common in laptops, where their higher cost is justified by battery power savings. The speakers in such equipment are still analog.

Safety oversight was the duty of the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate, while numerous operating companies run trains on the lines; the largest being the state owned passenger company Norges Statsbaner (NSB) and the freight company CargoNet.Norwegian National Rail Administration, 2008a: 12‚Äì16 The administration operated all railways in Norway, except public station areas and freight terminals built before 1997 and private sidings. All track is standard gauge, with a total of , of which is electrified, and is double track.Jernbanestatistikk 2012 page:4 The Norwegian Railway Museum was a subsidiary of the rail administration. On 1 December 1996, NSB was split up; formally NSB and the inspectorate were demerged from the National Rail Administration, and NSB made a limited company. All three became subordinate to the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications. The administration got its own chief executive, Steinar Killi, from 1 July 1999. On 31 December 2016, as a result of the rail reform of the Conservative lead government coalition, the administration was dissolved and all tasks were transferred to Bane NOR or the Norwegian Railway Directorate. Bane NOR took over ownership of the infrastructure from 1 January 2017. History State ownership of railways was initially through partial ownership of the many lines built during the 1860s and 1870s; by 1883, the authorities decided to create the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) that would own and operate most lines. By the 1960s, passenger transport on private railways was abolished, and only a few private lines remained; the last, the Kirkenes‚ÄìBj√∏rnevatn Line, was closed in 1997. Since then the agency has operated all railway lines in the country, except tramways and the Oslo T-bane, that are operated by their respective counties. The National Rail Administration was created on 1 December 1996 when Norges Statsbaner was split into two agencies, the Norwegian National Rail Administration and the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate, and one limited company, NSB BA. Until 1 July 1999, NSB and the administration continued to have the same board and the same director, Osmund Ueland. In 1985, NSB and Televerket agreed to build a national network of optical fiber that would span the entire railway network. This remained part of Jernbaneverket until 2001, when it was transferred to the subsidiary BaneTele. The same year it bought the bankrupt telecom company Enitel, and the whole subsidiary transferred to the Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry in 2002. In 2005, the maintenance division was demerged, and established as the limited company Baneservice, owned directly by the ministry. This was part of a program initiated by the conservative-liberal government to privatize the maintenance of the tracks, by forcing the administration to perform tenders; similar policies were being enforced on the Public Roads Administration and Coastal Administration. The process of privatizing the work of 1,100 employees was discontinued after the 2005 election, following the victory of the socialist coalition government. Operations All track is now standard gauge, with a total of , of which is electrified at , and is double track. The Gardermoen Line, at , is the only high-speed line. The network consists of 716 tunnels, 2,572 bridges and 3,690 level crossings. The railways transported 61,121,000 passengers for 3,202 million passenger kilometers and 30,271,000 tonnes of cargo for 3,489 million tonne kilometers in 2012. The same year there were 20 train-related accidents, with two fatalities. Organization The administration was divided into a directorate and divisions for infrastructure management, infrastructure construction and traffic management; BaneEnergi is subordinate to the traffic management and was responsible for supplying electricity to the railway companies. Main offices was located in Oslo, while regional offices was located in Bergen, Hamar and Trondheim, while train control areas was also located in Drammen, Kristiansand, Stavanger and Narvik. The administration also ran the Norwegian Railway College in Oslo and the Norwegian Railway Museum in Hamar.Norwegian National Rail Administration, 2008a: 51‚Äì52 The agency had about 2,900 employees.Norwegian National Rail Administration, 2008a: 49 In 2007, the administration had a revenue of NOK 5,661 million, of which 1,934 M went to operation, 1,369 M to maintenance, 67 M to the Gardermoen Line and 2,291 M to investments.Norwegian National Rail Administration, 2008a: 47 Of the investments 82% went to new lines, notably the Asker Line (25%), Stavanger‚ÄìSandnes (17%), Lysaker Station (17%) and Ganddal Yard (8%).Norwegian National Rail Administration, 2008a: 48 The administration received most of its income from the ministry, but railway companies had to pay to use the Gardermoen Line. Stations At the time of the demerger, all stations were transferred to NSB, but the administration retained ownership of the platforms. All stations opened after 1996 were owned by the administration; this has caused a complex ownership structure where sections of the stations may have different owners.Norwegian National Rail Administration, 2008b: 3 The operation of all stations was remained at the administration, while the NSB subsidiary Rom Eiendom is responsible for managing the railway unrelated sections of the stations, for instance the shopping center in Oslo Central Station.

It can be defined as: :The ability of network software and hardware to automatically control and configure itself and other network assets across any number of devices on a network. With regards to network hardware, network agility is used when referring to automatic hardware configuration and reconfiguration of network devices e.g. routers, switches, SNMP devices. Network agility, as a software discipline, borrows from many fields, both technical and commercial. On the technical side, network agility solutions leverage techniques from areas such as: * Service-oriented architecture (SOA) * Object-oriented design * Architectural patterns * Loosely coupled data streaming (e.g.: web services) * Iterative design * Artificial intelligence * Inductive scheduling * On- demand computing * Utility computing Commercially, network agility is about solving real-world business problems using existing technology. It forms a three-way bridge between business processes, hardware resources, and software assets. In more detail, it takes, as input: 1 #the business processes ‚Äì i.e. what the network must achieve in real business terms; #the hardware that resides within the network; and #the set of software assets that run on this hardware. Much of this input can be obtained through automatic discovery ‚Äì finding the hardware, its types and locations, software, licenses etc. The business processes can be inferred to a certain degree, but it is these processes that business managers need to be able to control and organize. Software resources discovered on the network can take a variety of forms ‚Äì some assets may be licensed software products, others as blocks of software service code that can be accessed via some service enterprise portal, such as (but not necessarily) web services. These services may reside in-house, or they may be 'on-demand' via an on-line subscription service. Indeed, the primary motivation of network agility is to make the most efficient use of the resources available, wherever they may reside, and to identify areas where business process goals are not being satisfied to some benchmark level (and ideally to offer possible solutions). Network agility tools are then in a position to optimize the existing hardware to run software assets as needed to achieve the business process goals. As network usage is never linear, the hardware/software mix requirements will change dynamically over various time segments (weekly, quarterly, annually etc.), and step changes will be required from time to time when business-process goals change/evolve/are updated (e.g. during/after a company re-organization). The benefits to business of the network agility approach are obvious ‚Äì cost savings in software licensing and higher efficiency of hardware assets ‚Äì leading to better productivity.

Ramsay had been a page at the Scottish court when the so-called Gowrie Conspiracy occurred in 1600. The actual nature of that affair is deeply disputed; the most likely account is that the young Ramsay stabbed the Earl of Gowrie to death with his dagger, helping to frustrate a plot to either kidnap or murder the then King James VI of Scotland. Ramsay was knighted in that year, and was created Viscount of Haddington and Lord Ramsay of Barns in the Scottish peerage on 11 June 1606, and Lord Ramsay of Melrose in 1609, among various other offices that he acquired during his Court career (Gentleman of the Bedchamber to James I, 1603; Joint Constable, Receiver, and Steward of Dunstable, 1604; etc.).Doyle, James William Edmund. The Official Baronage of England. London, Longmans, Green, 1885; p. 202. Prior to his 1608 marriage, Haddington received from James grants of land that yielded an annual income of ¬£1,000. The peak of Haddington's influence may have occurred at his marriage to Lady Elizabeth Radclyffe, daughter of the Earl of Sussex, on 9 February 1608; James himself gave away the bride at the wedding. The marriage was celebrated at Whitehall Palace with the masque The Hue and Cry After Cupid, by Ben Jonson and Inigo Jones.

Later, Haddington was supplanted as James's favourite, first by Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset, and then by George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham. Lady Haddington danced in the masque Tethys' Festival to celebrate the creation of Prince Henry as Prince of Wales on 5 June 1610.Memorials of Affairs of State from the papers of Ralph Winwood, vol. 3 (London, 1725), p. 181.

It was built in 1673 and has undergone many changes through the years. Initially, it was used as a home for the Spanish governor, as a royal winery, as a warehouse, and as both customs and National Bank's headquarters. The new presidential house replaced the old customs offices on January 19, 1885. The remodeling works included the addition of a new room for official events in the upper level, along with other rooms to be used by the president and his family members. A Colombian artist, Epifanio Garay, was in charged of painting the portraits of all presidents since 1855. The current Palacio de las Garzas was officially inaugurated on August 3, 1923. However, it was not until 1938 that it was acquired totally when the National Bank moved to its new headquarters located at Central Avenue. This transaction was in process since 1936 through an exchange with the Panamanian State. Extensive renovations to the building were done around 1922, under the supervision of architect Leonardo Villanueva-Meyer. Works included the Andalusian courtyard, the addition of a third floor and two towers. An elevator was added in 1934 for a State visit by US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt so that he could access the chambers where he was to stay. The building has served as the main office and official residence for all Panamanian presidents though some of them, such as Laurentino Cortizo, the current president, Juan Carlos Varela, Ricardo Martinelli, Mart√≠n Torrijos, Mireya Moscoso, Ernesto Perez Balladares, have chosen to keep their residences elsewhere in the city and commute to the palace. Rooms The Sal√≥n Amarillo (Yellow Room) is the most important room, where most formal events are held. The Sal√≥n de los Tamarindos (Tamarind's Room) is the presidential dining room and receives its name from its murals, where the Panamanian painter Roberto Lewis inspired his ideas on Taboga Island and its famous tamarind trees. This work was asked in 1938 by Juan Dem√≥stenes Arosemena, the president of that period. The Sal√≥n Morisco (Moorish Room) was added during the 1922 renovations by Villanueva-Meyer.

Crime Pays Plot Renko is depressed because his beloved wife Irina is dead due to a misunderstanding through carelessness on the part of a Russian doctor and his nurse. He is in a suicidal state of mind when anonymously summoned to Havana to help an old acquaintance out of some unspecified trouble. By the time he arrives, however, the good Colonel Pribluda, late of the SVR, has apparently died under very mysterious circumstances. The novel begins with Arkady at the tip of Havana Bay as the sun begins to rise on what promises to be a hot day in Cuba. The Cuban militia has what they believe is a dead Russian. Renko being a Senior Investigator from Moscow who knew Pribluda, the Cubans are hoping he can expedite matters by both confirming the liquefying corpse's identity and affirming it as a natural or accidental death. In a decaying Cuba filled with cars and houses that were built in the 1950s and are now falling to pieces, Renko stumbles upon a plot to defraud Russia of $250 million in an underhanded sugar purchase scam. Along the way, there are the gruesome killings, abakua ceremonies and attacks upon his person.

It developed in relation to the lumber industry. Located inland from the Atlantic coast, Mill Village was the site of Canada's first satellite earth station constructed in the 1960s. History Historically developed around logging and lumber, Mill Village lies along the Medway River. It has many old structures related to these industries pre- dating the era of cheap fuel. Many homes in the Mill Village area are well over 180 years old, and trees that were mature before the houses were built. Mill Village has a fire hall, churches, garage, and general store. Mill Village is less than 15 minutes from the town of Liverpool; about 20 minutes from the town of Bridgewater (the largest shopping and commercial center in the region); about 40 minutes from the towns of Lunenburg (designated a World Heritage Site by the United Nations) and Mahone Bay; about an hour and a half from the ferry terminals in Yarmouth and Digby; about an hour and a half from Halifax International Airport; and about an hour from downtown Halifax. Area attractions Mill Village is located in a 20-to-30-mile stretch along the southern coast of Queens County that is known as \\"Coastal Queens\\". The region, which includes the Medway Bay area, is among the most important ecological areas in Nova Scotia. Coastal Queens includes a host of white sandy beaches, bays and inlets, several Nova Scotia and national parks, a federal wilderness park and bird sanctuary, a number of small fishing villages, and several coastal lighthouses. The Seaside Adjunct to Kejimkujik National Park at Port Joli, Queens County is among the major attractions in the region. It is about a 35-minute drive from Mill Village. Closer to Mill Village is Carter's Beach, at Port Mouton, Queens County. The beach is among the most photographed white sandy beaches in the area. This area is among the most popular Nova Scotia sea kayaking routes in Coastal Queens. The Port Medway Lighthouse Park is about a 10-minute drive from Medway Bay. The park was officially opened in November 2002. Other outdoor destinations include Thomas Raddall Park (Port Joli), Fort Point Lighthouse Park (Liverpool), and Summerville Beach Provincial Park, (Summerville Center).

Nicolaas De Bruyne carved the statue in 1442, copying and enlarging an earlier and smaller statue from the 13th century. The polychromy was done by Roelof van Velpen. It has been restored several times: in 1842 by the Goyers workshop and in 1945 by Jos Van Uytvanck. It is located in St Peter's Church in the heart of the city of Leuven, Flanders. It is the symbol of the Catholic University of Leuven, and is depicted in the university's 1909 seal. Nowadays, it serves as the seal of the University of Louvain (UCLouvain) and of the KU Leuven.  Veneration of the image  The worship of the Sedes Sapientiae is evident, among other things, from the fact that the magistrate of Leuven regularly intervened in the costs of renewing the mantle made from gold wire. People came from far to worship her. There are traditions that high-ranking figures such as: Isabella of Portugal, wife of the Duke of Burgundy; Philip the Good; Charlemagne; Margaret of York, ... came to visit the statue.  Destruction  The statue was destroyed during the bombing in 1944 during the Second World War. The collapse of the marble altar led to the statue also falling down. Only a year later they started cleaning up the church. Several large pieces of the Sedes Sapientiae were found and so they could glue everything together again. Only three fingers from Baby Jesus, a small piece of the mantle and here and there some pieces had to be remade. The only change to the image was the removal of a hair curl on the child's temples and the replacement of the Gothic consoles on the pillars of the seat with spherical ends.

This restriction is imposed on the polyhedra because carbon nanotubes are formed of sp2 carbon atoms. Strip Algebra was developed initially for the determination of the structure connecting two arbitrary nanotubes, but has also been extended to the connection of three identical nanotubes Background Graphitic systems are molecules and crystals formed of carbon atoms in sp2 hybridization. Thus, the atoms are arranged on a hexagonal grid. Graphite, nanotubes, and fullerenes are examples of graphitic systems. All of them share the property that cach atom is bonded to three others (3-valent). The relation between the number of vertices, edges and faces of any finite polyhedron is given by Euler's polyhedron formula: : e - f - v = 2 (g -1),\\\\, where e, f and v are the number of edges, faces and vertices, respectively, and g is the genus of the polyhedron, i.e., the number of \\"holes\\" in the surface. For example, a sphere is a surface of genus 0, while a torus is of genus 1. Nomenclature A substrip is identified by a pair of natural numbers measuring the position of the last ring in parentheses, together with the turns induced by the defect ring. The number of edges of the defect can be extracted from these. :(n,m) [T_+,T_-] Elements A Strip is defined as a set of consecutive rings, that is able to be joined with others, by sharing a side of the first or last ring. Numerous complex structures can be formed with strips. As said before, strips have both at the beginning and at the end two connections. With strips only, can be formed two of them. Operators Given the definition of a strip, a set of operations may be defined. These are necessary to find out the combined result of a set of contiguous strips. * Addition of two strips: (upcoming) * Turn Operators: (upcoming) * Inversion of a strip: (upcoming) Applications * Strip Algebra has been applied to the construction of nanotube heterojunctions, and was first implemented in the CoNTub v1.0 software, which makes it possible to find the precise position of all the carbon rings needed to produce a heterojunction with arbitrary indices and chirality from two nanotubes.

After starring for the South Medford High School baseball team, Bechler was selected by the Orioles in the third round of the 1998 MLB draft. Following five seasons in Minor League Baseball, Bechler made his major league debut with the Orioles in 2002. Attending spring training in 2003, he died of heat stroke while participating in conditioning drills. A medical examiner found that Bechler's use of ephedra as a weight-loss supplement contributed to his death. Following this revelation, the Food and Drug Administration opened an inquiry, which resulted in the banning of ephedra products in the United States. Early life Bechler was born on November 18, 1979, in Medford, Oregon, to Ernest and Patricia Bechler. He had three brothers. At the age of seven, he began playing baseball. As a youth, he competed in the Medford American Little League, Babe Ruth League, and American Legion Baseball. He was a member of the 1997 American Legion World Series champions. Bechler suffered from asthma as a child, and endured heatstrokes while in high school. Baseball career Bechler attended South Medford High School in Medford, Oregon. He graduated in 1998. Playing for the school's baseball team, he was named to the All-Oregon third team in his senior year. Heading into the 1998 Major League Baseball draft, Baseball America rated Bechler the best high school prospect from the state of Oregon. The Baltimore Orioles selected him in the third round draft. Bechler signed with the Orioles, receiving a $257,000 signing bonus. He made his professional debut in Minor League Baseball with the Gulf Coast Orioles of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League that year. He pitched for the Delmarva Shorebirds of the Class A South Atlantic League in 1999, and for the Frederick Keys of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League in 2000. In 2001, he pitched for Frederick, and was named a Carolina League All-Star. He did not appear in the All-Star Game, as he was promoted to the Rochester Red Wings of the Class AAA International League. After struggling in two outings for Rochester, he was demoted to the Bowie Baysox of the Class AA Eastern League, where he remained for the rest of the season. After the 2001 season, the Orioles assigned Bechler to the Maryvale Saguaros of the Arizona Fall League. The Orioles added Bechler to their 40-man roster to protect him from being eligible in the Rule 5 draft. In 2002, Bechler pitched for Bowie and Rochester. He had a 2‚Äì1 win‚Äìloss record with a 3.42 earned run average (ERA) with Bowie and 6‚Äì11 record and a 4.09 ERA with Rochester. At the end of the minor league season, the Orioles promoted Bechler to the major leagues. He appeared in three games for the Orioles, pitching innings, in which he allowed six hits, four walks, three home runs, and recorded three strikeouts. He suffered a strained hamstring in his final appearance. Personal life On October 22, 2002, Bechler married Kiley Mae Nixon at Community Bible Church in Central Point, Oregon. The couple were expecting a child at the time of his death.He was a gamer Sports Illustrated. Saturday March 8, 2003 His daughter, Hailie, was born in April 2003. Death On February 16, 2003, towards the beginning of Orioles' spring training camp in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Bechler collapsed while participating in conditioning drills. He was rushed to a nearby hospital, and died the next day. His body temperature had reached . An autopsy performed by Dr. Joshua Perper, a toxicologist serving as the medical examiner for Broward County, concluded that his death was caused by \\"'abnormal liver function and mild hypertension', his weight problem (he weighed 230 pounds and was exercising hard), the fact that he was not used to south Florida's warm weather and the toxicity of ephedra.Death at the ballpark: a comprehensive study of game- related fatalities of ...

Fleckenstein p. 314. and probably had not eaten in two days in an effort to lose weight. At the time of Bechler's death, ephedra was banned by the International Olympic Committee, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, and the National Football League, but not by Major League Baseball. Bud Selig, the Commissioner of Baseball, called for a ban of ephedrine in the wake of Bechler's death. Numerous teams banned the use of ephedra in team clubhouses. Following Bechler's death, the Food and Drug Administration, which had previously chosen not to ban ephedra, re-opened its efforts to regulate ephedra use. The United States Congress dropped its objections to banning ephedra, and Bechler's parents testified in front of Congress. The FDA announced its decision to ban ephedra on December 30. Bechler was cremated following his death. On the six month anniversary of his death, Kiley scattered his ashes on the pitcher's mound of Oriole Park at Camden Yards. She filed a wrongful death claim against Nutraquest, the manufacturers of the supplement, seeking $600 million in damages. The lawsuit against Nutraquest was suspended in October 2003 when the company filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Code.

It ran along a tributary of the river called Paint Creek to Kingston, crossing the Kanawha-Fayette county line about one mile south of Burnwell.

MacCorkle, industrialist Henry Huttleston Rogers, acting on behalf of Charles Pratt and Company, negotiated its lease of the entire line to the C&O.; It later came under ownership of the C&O;, and was later known as the C&O;'s Paint Creek Branch. (EDIT) There is no proof that HH Rogers was involved in this project. Gov. MacCorkle in his book (pp 412) relates that he talked with Rogers about this later and that Rogers thought that it was a blunder by the Pratt interests to sell this property.

It also connected with the C&O; along the Kanawha River, and was run by the C&O; in its early years. However, the Deepwater Railway, headed by mining manager and developer William Nelson Page, and funded by Rogers, was eventually extended east to the West Virginia-Virginia state line, at which point it connected with the new Tidewater Railway, a line which Page and Rogers built to connect all the way east across Virginia to a new coal pier at Sewell's Point in the harbor of Hampton Roads. In 1907, they were combined to form the Virginian Railway, now a portion of the Norfolk Southern Railway.

Generally organised crime groups in Hong Kong keep a low profile and many of its most profitable activities do not attract high levels of public outrage e.g. illegal gambling and copyright piracy. As organised crime does not necessarily equate with street crime, it has been said that Hong Kong society can be lulled into a false sense of security. Without high levels of street crime and no great numbers of Mafia-style organised crime syndicates, it has been suggested that the people of Hong Kong, believe that their society is, in law and order terms, healthy and clean, although this may not be the case.

He then joined Dundee United where he scored in the 1987 UEFA Cup semi final win against Borussia M√∂nchengladbach. He then played for Ipswich Town, St Johnstone and Brechin City (as player manager) before wrapping up his career with two winners medals at Raith Rovers. Background Redford grew up on a farm in Perthshire. He became deaf in one ear as a child and hid this fact during his football career. When Redford was 12 his younger brother, Douglas, died of leukemia. He later described this as a turning point in his life. Playing career=Dundee Redford began his career at Errol Rovers, a youth football team set up by his father. From there he joined and came through the youth system at Dundee and made his first appearance for the senior team as a substitute 11 days after his 17th birthday during season 1976/77. Redford played mostly as a forward during his time at Dundee F.C. and is remembered for scoring the goals that clinched the First Division Championship in the 1978/79 season. He was a consistent goal scorer for Dundee with 35 strikes from his 85 league games. He played only six months with Dundee in the top flight.

He played for them during one of the club's most successful spells in its history and where he played the games for which he is most remembered. United made it to the 1986/87 UEFA Cup Final. En route they defeated Terry Venables' F.C. Barcelona side featuring Gary Lineker and Mark Hughes at home and away in the quarter finals. Redford delivered the free kick headed home by John Clark for the 2nd leg equaliser at Camp Nou. This prompted Lineker to prophetically say to one of the United players, 'this mob'll just chuck it,' before United scored a second goal of the game.\\"The forgotten story of ...

His best-known work is the novel Catch-22, a satire on war and bureaucracy, whose title has become a synonym for an absurd or contradictory choice. Early years Heller was born on May 1, 1923 in Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York,. the son of poor Jewish parents, Lena and Isaac Donald Heller,. from Russia. Even as a child, he loved to write; as a teenager, he wrote a story about the Russian invasion of Finland and sent it to the New York Daily News, which rejected it. After graduating from Abraham Lincoln High School in 1941,Hechinger, Fred M. \\"About education; Personal Touch Helps\\", The New York Times, January 1, 1980. Retrieved 2009-09-20. \\"Lincoln, an ordinary, unselective New York City high school, is proud of a galaxy of prominent alumni, who include the playwright Arthur Miller, Representative Elizabeth Holtzman, the authors Joseph Heller and Ken Auletta, the producer Mel Brooks, the singer Neil Diamond and the songwriter Neil Sedaka.\\" Heller spent the next year working as a blacksmith's apprentice, a messenger boy, and a filing clerk. In 1942, at age 19, he joined the U.S. Army Air Corps. Two years later he was sent to the Italian Front, where he flew 60 combat missions as a B-25 bombardier. His unit was the 488th Bombardment Squadron, 340th Bomb Group, 12th Air Force. Heller later remembered the war as \\"fun in the beginning ... You got the feeling that there was something glorious about it.\\" On his return home he \\"felt like a hero ... People think it quite remarkable that I was in combat in an airplane and I flew sixty missions even though I tell them that the missions were largely milk runs.\\" After the war, Heller studied English at the University of Southern California and then New York University on the G.I. Bill, graduating from the latter institution in 1948. In 1949, he received his M.A. in English from Columbia University. Following his graduation from Columbia, he spent a year as a Fulbright scholar in St Catherine's College, OxfordCatz People before teaching composition at Pennsylvania State University for two years (1950‚Äì52).The Editors of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Last Updated 5-15-2014 He then briefly worked for Time Inc., before taking a job as a copywriter at a small advertising agency,Advertising copywriter for Time (1952‚Äì56) and Look (1956‚Äì58) magazines; promotion manager for McCall's (1958‚Äì61): The Editors of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Last Updated 5-15-2014 where he worked alongside future novelist Mary Higgins Clark. At home, Heller wrote. He was first published in 1948, when The Atlantic ran one of his short stories. The story nearly won the \\"Atlantic First\\". He was married to Shirley Held from 1945 to 1981 and they had two children, Erica (born 1952) and Theodore (born 1956). Career=Catch-22 While sitting at home one morning in 1953, Heller thought of the lines, \\"It was love at first sight. The first time he saw the chaplain, [Yossarian] fell madly in love with him.\\" Within the next day, he began to envision the story that could result from this beginning, and invented the characters, the plot, and the tone that the story would eventually take. Within a week, he had finished the first chapter and sent it to his agent. He did not do any more writing for the next year, as he planned the rest of the story. The initial chapter was published in 1955 as \\"Catch-18\\", in Issue 7 of New World Writing. Although he originally intended the story to be no longer than a novelette, Heller was able to add enough substance to the plot that he felt it could become his first novel. When he was one-third done with the work, his agent, Candida Donadio, sent it to publishers. Heller was not particularly attached to the work, and decided that he would not finish it if publishers were not interested. The work was soon purchased by Simon & Schuster, who gave him US $750 and promised him an additional $750 when the full manuscript was delivered. Heller missed his deadline by four to five years, but, after eight years of thought, delivered the novel to his publisher. The finished novel describes the wartime experiences of Army Air Corps Captain John Yossarian. Yossarian devises multiple strategies to avoid combat missions, but the military bureaucracy is always able to find a way to make him stay. As Heller observed, \\"Everyone in my book accuses everyone else of being crazy. Frankly, I think the whole society is nuts ‚Äì and the question is: What does a sane man do in an insane society?\\" Just before publication, the novel's title was changed to Catch-22 to avoid confusion with Leon Uris' new novel, Mila 18. The novel was published in hardback in 1961 to mixed reviews, with the Chicago Sun-Times calling it \\"the best American novel in years\\", while other critics derided it as \\"disorganized, unreadable, and crass\\". It sold only 30,000 hardback copies in the United States in its first year of publication. Reaction was very different in the UK, where, within one week of its publication, the novel was number one on the bestseller lists. In the years after its release in paperback in October 1962, however, Catch-22 caught the imaginations of many baby boomers, who identified with the novel's anti-war sentiments. The book went on to sell 10 million copies in the United States. The novel's title became a standard term in English and other languages for a dilemma with no easy way out. Now considered a classic, the book was listed at number 7 on Modern Library's list of the top 100 novels of the century. The United States Air Force Academy uses the novel to \\"help prospective officers recognize the dehumanizing aspects of bureaucracy.\\" The movie rights to the novel were purchased in 1962, and, combined with his royalties, made Heller a millionaire. The film, which was directed by Mike Nichols and starred Alan Arkin, Jon Voight and Orson Welles, was not released until 1970. In April 1998, Lewis Pollock wrote to The Sunday Times for clarification as to \\"the amazing similarity of characters, personality traits, eccentricities, physical descriptions, personnel injuries and incidents\\" in Catch-22 and a novel published in England in 1951. The book that spawned the request was written by Louis Falstein and titled The Sky Is a Lonely Place in Britain and Face of a Hero in the United States. Falstein's novel was available two years before Heller wrote the first chapter of Catch-22 (1953). The Times stated: \\"Both have central characters who are using their wits to escape the aerial carnage; both are haunted by an omnipresent injured airman, invisible inside a white body cast\\". Stating he had never read Falstein's novel, or heard of him,(link broken) Heller said: \\"My book came out in 1961[;] I find it funny that nobody else has noticed any similarities, including Falstein himself, who died just last year\\".The Washington Post, April 27, 1998 Other works Other works by Heller are examples of modern satire which center on the lives of members of the middle class. Shortly after Catch-22 was published, Heller thought of an idea for his next novel, which would become Something Happened, but did not act on it for two years. In the meantime he focused on scripts, completing the final screenplay for the movie adaptation of Helen Gurley Brown's Sex and the Single Girl, as well as a television comedy script that eventually aired as part of \\"McHale's Navy\\". In 1967, Heller wrote a play called We Bombed in New Haven. He completed the play in only six weeks, but spent a great deal of time working with the producers as it was brought to the stage. It delivered an anti-war message while discussing the Vietnam War. It was originally produced by the Repertory Company of the Yale Drama School, with Stacy Keach in the starring role. After a slight revision, it was published by Alfred A. Knopf and then debuted on Broadway, starring Jason Robards. Heller's follow-up novel, Something Happened, was finally published in 1974. Critics were enthusiastic about the book, and both its hardcover and paperback editions reached number one on the New York Times bestseller list. Heller wrote another five novels, each of which took him several years to complete. One of them, Closing Time, revisited many of the characters from Catch-22 as they adjusted to post-war New York. All of the novels sold respectably well, but could not duplicate the success of his first novel. Told by an interviewer that he had never produced anything else as good as Catch-22, Heller famously responded, \\"Who has?\\" Work process Heller did not begin work on a story until he had envisioned both a first and last line. The first sentence usually appeared to him \\"independent of any conscious preparation.\\" In most cases, the sentence did not inspire a second sentence. At times, he would be able to write several pages before giving up on that hook. Usually, within an hour or so of receiving his inspiration, Heller would have mapped out a basic plot and characters for the story. When he was ready to begin writing, he focused on one paragraph at a time, until he had three or four handwritten pages, which he then spent several hours reworking. Heller maintained that he did not \\"have a philosophy of life, or a need to organize its progression. My books are not constructed to 'say anything.'\\" Only when he was almost one-third finished with the novel would he gain a clear vision of what it should be about. At that point, with the idea solidified, he would rewrite all that he had finished and then continue to the end of the story. The finished version of the novel would often not begin or end with the sentences he had originally envisioned, although he usually tried to include the original opening sentence somewhere in the text. Later teaching career After the publication of Catch-22, Heller resumed a part-time academic career as an adjunct professor of creative writing at Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania.Muste, John M. \\"Joseph Heller.\\" Magill's Survey of American Literature, Revised Edition (2007): EBSCO. Web. Nov 8, 2010. In the 1970s, Heller taught creative writing as a distinguished professor at the City College of New York. Illness On Sunday, December 13, 1981, Heller was diagnosed with Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome, a debilitating syndrome that was to leave him temporarily paralyzed. He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of Mount Sinai Medical Hospital the same day, and remained there, bedridden, until his condition had improved enough to permit his transfer to the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine on January 26, 1982. His illness and recovery are recounted at great length in the autobiographical No Laughing Matter, which contains alternating chapters by Heller and his good friend Speed Vogel. The book reveals the assistance and companionship Heller received during this period from a number of his prominent friends‚ÄîMel Brooks, Mario Puzo, Dustin Hoffman and George Mandel among them. Heller eventually made a substantial recovery. In 1987 he married Valerie Humphries, formerly one of his nurses. Later years Heller returned to St. Catherine's as a visiting Fellow, for a term, in 1991 and was appointed an Honorary Fellow of the college. In 1998, he released a memoir, Now and Then: From Coney Island to Here, in which he relived his childhood as the son of a deliveryman and offered some details about the inspirations for Catch-22. Heller was an agnostic. He died of a heart attack at his home in East Hampton, on Long Island, in December 1999, shortly after the completion of his final novel, Portrait of an Artist, as an Old Man. On hearing of Heller's death, his friend Kurt Vonnegut said, \\"Oh, God, how terrible.

Early life  Crofts was born in Monmouth, Wales and was the son of John Crofts. At the age of 17 he matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford. The University of Oxford awarded him the degree Bachelor of Arts in February 1743 and the degree Master of Arts in 1746. The Grand Tour In the following 20 years Crofts alternated between the closeted life of a Fellow of an Oxford College and at least three extended tours of Europe.G Macdonald, 'Catalogue of Greek Coins in the Hunterian Collection', 1899, Preface On one such visit (1758‚Äì1759) he accompanied a young Oxford Graduate, Thomas Knight, a cousin and future benefactor of the family of Jane Austen the novelist, on the Grand Tour.Obituary of Knight, The Gentlemans Magazine, 1794, p. 1058 On such visits Crofts brought back many rare books and coins. In 1763 Crofts was installed as Rector of Donyat, Somerset. He then travelled to Aleppo, Syria where he was chaplain to the English Factory in the late 1760s and there continued researching and collecting antiquities.R Chandler, 'Travels in Asia Minor', 1775, p143  Literati  In 1770 Crofts returned to England as Chaplain to the 4th Duke of Leeds and lived in Bury Street in the fashionable district of St. James. He became a member of the literati frequenting the so- called 'Literary Coffee House' at the shop of the bookseller and publisher Thomas Payne. His friends and colleagues included Thomas Tyrwhitt, George Steevens, John Hoole and the anatomist and numismatist William Hunter. His library was now very extensive and books borrowed from it helped Tyrwhitt with 'The Canterbury Tales of Chaucer' (1775) and also Hoole with his translation of 'Orlando Furioso' (1783). Crofts also came to the attention of the Dilettante Society as Lord Seaforth, the Marquis of Carmarthen (Francis Osborne son of the Duke of Leeds) and the naturalist Joseph Banks nominated him for membership in The Royal Society in March 1776. It was also in 1776 that Crofts was involved with the publication of the spoof poems of Thomas Rowley, a medieval monk, which had in fact been written by Thomas Chatterton (1752‚Äì1770).LF Powell 'Thomas Chatterton and the Rowley Poems'. Review of English Studies Vol 7 July 1931 Contemporary correspondence shows that Crofts recommended Tyrwhitt as an expert to George Catcott, who possessed the 'manuscripts', and he also suggested Payne as a publisher. These poems were subsequently edited by Tyrrwhitt and published as genuine in 1777 only for Tyrwhitt to recant and expose them as forgeries.  Health problems and death  During the late 1770s Crofts' health began to deteriorate. He sold his large collection of coins to Hunter in January 1781 and died at the home of the 4th Earl Fitzwilliam at Milton Park, Northamptonshire on 8 Nov that year. A tribute in the 'Biographical Memoirs of William Bowyer'J Nichols ' Literary anecdotes of the eighteenth century comprising biographical memoirs of William Bowyer' 1812 p 481 described Crofts as \\"distinguished for his general attainments as well as antient erudition . . gleaned . . not of reading only but of intelligent travels\\".

The play opened at the old Christiania Theatre on 19 January 1864. The plot revolves around the historical conflict between Norwegian King H√•kon H√•konsson and his father-in-law, Earl Skule B√•rdsson.

In the earlier part of the reign of King H√•kon, much of the royal power was in the hands of Skule B√•rdsson. In 1225, H√•kon married Skule's daughter Margaret Skulesdatter. The relationship between the two became strained as H√•kon asserted his power. In 1239, the conflict between the two erupted into open warfare when Skule had himself proclaimed king. The rebellion ended in 1240 when Skule was put to death.

It was run by the Benedictine sisters for 88 years. Its campus is located at Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu, Philippines. It offers programs in the preparatory, elementary and secondary levels. The school is accredited by the PAASCU. It is the first private school on the island of Mactan founded by the Redemptorist Fathers in 1916. Father Mathew O'Callaghan was considered to be its founder.St. Aphonsus Archives Since 1921, SACS has been under the administration of the Missionary Benedictine Sisters even when the Parish was turned over by the Redemptorists to the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart (MSC) in 1921. In 1991, SACS celebrated its Diamond Jubilee. SACS celebrated its 90th foundation day in August 2005. In August 2016, the school celebrated its 100th year of foundation. History of Saint Alphonsus Catholic School One of the great blessings God bestowed on Opon (Lapu-Lapu) was the establishment of Saint Alphonsus Catholic School (Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu) Inc. popularly known in the community as Saint Alphonsus Catholic School (SACS). Founded in 1916 by Rev. Fr. Mateo O' Callaghan, a Redemptorist Priest, who named it in honor of their founder, St. Alphonsus de Liguori, the school has been faithfully helping the inhabitants of the island. In 1916, the primary course was opened with 250 pupils and in 1918 the intermediate grades were added, thus completing the Elementary Department. Desirous of spreading their educational apostolate over the island, the Redemptorists Fathers opened branch schools in the year 1920. They spread through Mactan, Agus, Babag, Sta. Rosa, Kalawisan, Basak and Pajo. Being mainly supported by parish funds, the schools managed to survive until the 1950s. Gradually, they were phased out due to the newly opened public schools. In 1921, the Missionary Benedictine Sisters were called to administer Saint Alphonsus Catholic School (Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu) Inc. In 1929, the Redemptorist Priests turned over the parish to the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart (MSC) and the Benedictine Sisters continued in administering the school. As early as 1922, the Secondary Department was opened for the first and second year students. Saint Alphonsus Catholic School (Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu) Inc. continued to operate until the outbreak of the Second World War. Because of this, the school was forced to close down. In 1946, however, SACS was reopened. In 1947, Year Three was added; in 1948, Year Four, and in 1949, SACS promoted its first batch of high school graduates. In 1973 a night Secondary Course was offered to Year One and Two. It gradually moved up to five years and produced its first graduates in 1977. However, in 1988, it was phased out. SACS which began with an initial school population of 250, has reached an enrolment of 3,706 (S.Y. 1998-1999) for both Elementary and High School. To meet the demands of the continued increase in enrollment, the school plant has been accordingly expanded. From a one-story building, the school has now maintained a complex of eight buildings. In 1985, the school went through its preliminary survey accreditation. In May 1990, the High School Department was granted an initial accreditation by the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU). In 1991, Saint Alphonsus Catholic School (Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu) Inc. celebrated another momentous event in her history: her diamond jubilee. This is a living manifestation that for 75 years the institution has persistently and unwaveringly committed herself to the program of empowering the young citizens of the community. In April 2002, the Grade School was awarded certificate of accredited status for a period of three years, hence, making both departments accredited. In the year 2005, the Grade School Department was accredited Level II status by the PAASCU. Then on March 16, 2006, the school was granted the permission for recognition to operate a pre-elementary course. In 2009, with the Benedictine Sisters deciding to focus on their own schools and considering other forms of ministry, the school went through the transition stage. The Congregation of the Daughters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart (FDNSC) was invited to work with the Benedictine Sisters. The administration of the school was then under the two Religious Congregations. Sr. M. Reginalda Cortez, OSB acted as the Directress and Principal of the High School Department while the sisters from the Congregation of the Daughters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart took on the other administrative roles. Since 2010, the DOLSH Sisters have taken the responsibility to manage SACS in accordance with the policies and standards set by the Department of Education (DepEd) and the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU). In 2015, the High School Department was granted Level II Re-Accredited status. In 2016, SACS celebrated the most significant milestone in her history: her Centennial Jubilee. This is undoubtedly striking evidence that for 100 years the institution has perseveringly and steadfastly committed herself to provide quality Christian education for social transformation. More so the granting of PAASCU Level II Re-Accredited Status to the Grade School Department and Level III Re-Accredited Status to the High School Department has greatly confirmed the school‚Äôs thrust for academic excellence and character formation of the young Alphonsian in her care. In the same year, Senior High School was opened offering the General Academic Strand comprising four (4) sections with 164 students. In 2017, the Grade School Department was awarded Level III Re- Accredited Status. In 2018, SACS produced the first batch of Senior High School graduates. On June 5, 2018, the application for STEM and HUMSS offerings was approved by the Department of Education. In keeping with the signs of the times, the school continuously evaluates its efforts and updates its master plan in order to make them more useful and relevant and to reflect the changes in the educational needs of the students and community as well. SACS Situation-Vision-Mission (SVM) Situation St. Alphonsus Student Handbook Revised 2019Lapu-Lapu City (formerly Opon), encrusted on the island of Mactan, was once an island paradise, rich in beauty of nature and in wealth of the sea, rich in human spirit that has produced the famous guitars, and rich in history and faith for it was here that Malayan courage withstood the Western power. Lapu-Lapu City is also the sanctuary of the famous Lady of the Rule, Now a national shrine, the Nuestra Se≈Ñora Virgen de Regla Parish is a site for pilgrims. Today, Lapu-Lapu City has become a highly urbanized city with export processing zones, multi-national corporations, world-class beach resort and hotels, and an international airport that ferries people from near and far. Together with this progress are the economic, societal, and environmental concern: unemployment, underemployment, and urban poverty. Urban poverty spawns a multitude of issues like corruption, landlessness, street children and child poor, prostitution, drug addiction, crimes, and violence that have eroded the people's right to development as human beings. Alongside with these are societal concerns like traffic congestion, pollution, lack of water supply, destruction of coral reefs, and other forms of ecological degradation. The young Alphonsian, in effect, is exposed to the negative impacts of modernization and the problems of an urbanized city. Vision As a Catholic school, we envision a Christian Learning Community where every student's * mind is challenged to seek what is true, * heart is nurtured to desire and love what is good, and * body is disciplined to express and create what is beautiful and useful. Mission To attain this vision, we have to: * provide a holistic environment program which fosters total development of students, * provide adequate and well-maintained facilities to enhance the whole teaching-learning process, * offer an integral on-going formation program to teachers, non-teaching personnel, and administration for their personal, professional, psycho-spiritual, and moral development, and * witness to moral and spiritual values that our students become socially aware and actively responsive to the needs of the society, especially the \\"cry of the poor\\" and the challenging of taking care of God's creation.

Nuclear weapons programme During the 1960s and 1980s South Africa had been pursuing research into the development of nuclear weapons as well as biological and chemical weapons. South Africa was able to acquire Uranium from native ore deposits, and used aerodynamic nozzle enrichment techniques to produce weapons-grade Uranium. Six bombs were constructed, with one still under construction before the termination of its nuclear weapons programme. It is alleged that South Africa had been collaborating with Israel to develop nuclear weapons and that it possibly detonated one of its weapons over the Indian Ocean in a nuclear weapons test. South Africa dismantled its nuclear weapons programme in 1989, the first nation in the world to do so, and became a signatory of the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty in 1991.Von Wielligh, N. & von Wielligh-Steyn, L.

South Africa continues to use its surplus of Uranium as part of its nuclear energy programme, supplying the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station and SAFARI-1 research reactors. Government policy Despite government efforts to encourage entrepreneurship in biotechnology, information technology and other high technology fields, not many notable groundbreaking companies have been founded in South Africa. It is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology, based on the realisation that South Africa cannot compete with Far Eastern economies in manufacturing, nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity.

The reasons for the monument The monument bears a plaque which reads: > \\"On this spot at 7.30 am on Thursday 14th November 1918, General von Lettow- > Vorbeck, commanding the German forces in East Africa, heard from Mr Hector > Croad, then District Commissioner Kasama, of the signing of the Armistice by > the German government, which provided for the unconditional evacuation of > all German forces from East Africa\\". A second plaque in the Bemba language ends with the words > Twapela umuchinshi kuli bonse abashipa abalwile mu nkondo iyi which means we honour all brave soldiers in this war. (More Africans than Europeans fought and died on both sides in the East African campaign, thousands more Africans who served as porters (sometimes under force) also died, and the civilian population suffered tremendously).Fred Reid: In Search of Willie Patterson: A Scottish Soldier in the Age of Imperialism Cualann Press, Dunfermaline (2002). p.121. The message given to General von Lettow- Vorbeck was a telegram sent to Croad which read: > \\"Please send the following to General von Lettow-Vorbeck under a white flag > - The English Prime Minister sent notice that on 11th November an Armistice > was signed and that the fighting on all fronts should cease on 11th November > at 11 o'clock. I order my troops to end hostilities as from now and I expect > you to do the same. General van Deventer\\". Hence the Memorial marks the cessation of hostilities, not the surrender itself. Location The location of the Monument is on the north bank of the Chambeshi River, near the northern end of the old Chambeshi Bridge (which was built later, this bridge was destroyed by Rhodesian troops during the Rhodesian Bush War, a new bridge was built further upstream) on the Mpika- Kasama road. Most accounts of the war say that Lettow-Vorbeck surrendered at Abercorn (now Mbala), 250 km to the north, giving the impression that he penetrated just the few kilometres to Abercorn from German East Africa, but that is only because he was instructed by the British imperial commanders in Northern Rhodesia to march his undefeated troops there for the official surrender on 23 November 1918. Historical background The British force had been waiting in the Abercorn area to attack the German forces coming from northern Mozambique, thinking they would make for Lake Tanganyika, but General von Lettow-Vorbeck had evaded them by turning south-west towards Kasama. Its tiny British population evacuated to Mpika,The Northern Rhodesia Journal, Vol IV No 5 (1961) pp440-442. \\"The Evacuation of Kasama in 1918\\". Accessed 7 March 2007. except for nine who set up two Maxim guns at the Chambeshi, but they did not know how to work them. One, Charlie Simpson, had with him about ¬£10,000 which was all the cash from the government offices and businesses in Kasama, which he buried in a goat pen near the rubber factory he ran, thinking that the goats' hoofprints would hide evidence of digging, and that the Germans would probably be more interested in the goats than looking for the money. On arrival at the Chambeshi the Germans machine-gunned the rubber factory before Croad arrived with the telegram. Setting up the monument The Monument was unveiled on 14 November 1953 as a National Monument of Northern Rhodesia (as the country was then) and consists of a large stone platform with the plaques set into a stone pillar, next to a cannon of the era (but not one used by the Germans).Sir Stewart Gore-Browne: \\"The Chambeshi Memorial\\", The Northern Rhodesia Journal, Vol 2 No 5 pp 81-84 (1954).

Rising to 685 ft (209 m), it is the 82nd tallest building in New York. History Prior to the start of construction, building developer Solomon Equities Inc. had signed the law firm Proskauer Rose to a 20-year lease for , a notable deal due to the glut of commercial real estate on the market at the time, with relatively few major tenants seeking space. This also came after News Corporation walked away from their longstanding commitment to lease the balance of the building from the developer, and was further on the heels of News Corp's near financial collapse. In December 1991, the project filed for bankruptcy. A consortium of banks then worked with the developers and agreed to take control of the asset through the bankruptcy process and hired Hines Interests Limited Partnership to manage the property. Morgan Stanley bought the building for $176 million in August 1993 and moved in two years later. Currently, it uses the building as its world headquarters. Management and engineering All of Morgan Stanley's properties are currently managed by Hines Interests. DataComm management is jointly tasked between Morgan Stanley's IT unit referred to as \\"Morgan Stanley - Critical Systems\\" as well as Hines Interests. As of 1994, The building's peak electrical demand was 9,288 kW. This excludes the loads brought on by Morgan Stanley's tenants. Two floors of 1585 Broadway are reserved strictly for building operations, both of which can be observed from the exterior of the building by noticing its lack of windows. * The seventh floor (Referred to as 7M) contains the building's fleet of 7 Mitsubishi 2000 kW generators reserved for building operations, as well as a separate generator manufactured by Caterpillar Inc. which is reserved for the building's life safety system. The 7th floor also houses the building's 3 electric chillers (2) 1,400 ton chillers, as well as (1) 1,200 ton chiller. Morgan Stanley site control is also contained on the 7th floor. This site operations command center monitors conditions of all of Morgan Stanley's properties. * The building contains various UPS systems throughout the facility, strategically located according to the locations of critical loads such as Trading Floors, Data Centers, and DataComm rooms. * Morgan Stanley typically conducts an annual test, as well as preventative maintenance of all the building's mechanical, and electrical components in January.

History The Calvary Cemetery, Greenpoint and Brooklyn Railroad began operating the Calvary Cemetery Line on Greenpoint Avenue, from Greenpoint Ferry in Brooklyn east across the Blissville Bridge over Newtown Creek to Calvary Cemetery in Queens, in the mid-1880s. This route ran along part of the Bushwick Railroad's Bushwick Avenue Line west of Manhattan Avenue. On April 21, 1887, the Brooklyn Crosstown Railroad, which operated on Manhattan Avenue, bought the company, which was not profitable. The Crosstown soon began building the rest of the CCG&B;'s proposed system, from the Crosstown's stables on Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint east on Ash Street, south on McGuinness Boulevard, west on Driggs Avenue, and south on Union Avenue, Broadway, and Throop Avenue to a terminus at Park Avenue. This included some trackage of the Bushwick Railroad's Bushwick Avenue Line and the Crosstown's Crosstown Line on Driggs Avenue. Plans were also made to continue the line south past Park Avenue to Prospect Park, but were not carried through. The Park Avenue Line, a cable car line, ran from Fulton Ferry east to Bushwick, including a stretch of Crosstown trackage on Park Avenue between Navy Street and Washington Avenue. It had been built by the Atlantic Avenue Railroad and leased to a cable company. The line was a failure, and the lessee transferred the lease to the Crosstown in July 1887, giving the Crosstown access to downtown and an outlet for the Union Avenue Line. Horse cars replaced Park Avenue cable cars on July 16, and Union Avenue cars began running to the Brooklyn Bridge around then. The Brooklyn City Rail Road leased the Crosstown on August 1, 1889, and on August 2 it truncated the Union Avenue route to Park Avenue; about a month later the original owner - the Atlantic Avenue Railroad - began operating the Park Avenue Line with horse cars. On April 27, 1890, the Brooklyn City opened new trackage on Flushing Avenue from Graham Avenue east to Metropolitan Avenue, and on Knickerbocker Avenue from Flushing Avenue southeast to Myrtle Avenue. In addition to introducing a new Flushing Avenue Line (the existing line on Flushing Avenue was the Graham Avenue Line), it rerouted the Union Avenue Line to run from Ridgewood to Greenpoint Ferry. This new route used Myrtle Avenue, Knickerbocker Avenue, Flushing Avenue, Throop Avenue, Union Avenue, Driggs Avenue, Manhattan Avenue, and Greenpoint Avenue.

He first appeared as an original character in 1995, before leaving in 1998. In 2004, Mellor reprised his role briefly for a Christmas special episode. The word \\"Jambo\\" comes from a greeting in the Swahili language. Characterisation Jambo is described as having an \\"idiosyncratic approach to life - he disliked convention and had a naturally inquisitive mind, often pondering on life's little mysteries, such as the theory of tumbling toast\\". Liverpool Echo described him as \\"the happy- go-lucky jack-the-lad with an eye for the ladies\\". Storylines Jambo was an individualist, putting his unique stamp on anything that came his way, from his formula for salty vinegar and his devotion to Margaret the cow. Jambo had a penchant for climbing through windows, yet, as he argued, \\"Why walk round to the door when the window is right in front of you?\\". Jambo was good friends with Kurt Benson and Tony Hutchinson and, whilst they were often confused by his odd behaviour, the three formed a strong bond, providing one another with support and, very often, humour needed to get through their rather tumultuous lives. Meanwhile, Kurt was soon paired off with Ruth Osborne and Tony was hopelessly in love with Julie Matthews. Jambo was often left on the sidelines, unlucky in love and unable to act on the feelings he had for Dawn Cunningham. After countless missed opportunities as well as Jambo's brief relationship with Carol Groves‚Äôs sister, Anita and his stepmother Lisa, Dawn and Jambo finally admitted their feelings for each other. The other woman in Jambo‚Äôs life was his Bond Bug Beryl, whom he loved and cherished almost as much as Dawn. Tragically, Jambo's romance with Dawn was short-lived, as she was diagnosed with leukaemia. She eventually lost her battle against the disease, leaving Jambo devastated over the loss of his girl he wanted more than anything else in the world. Jambo never got over the death of Dawn and, although he tried to persevere with his new landscaping business, '‚ÄòDig It!‚Äô, he decided that there were too many memories of Dawn in Hollyoaks and he wanted to move on. However, Jambo certainly left the female population of Hollyoaks with a memory they would cherish, when he was the unwilling stripper at Jude's opening night at the Parkers. Jambo finally bid farewell to Hollyoaks to begin a new life in Anglesey in 1998 but made one final visit to Hollyoaks to put flowers on Dawn's grave and vowed never to return. Jambo reappeared when the gang went to a trip to Anglesey to visit him. At Christmas 2004, Jambo reappeared as a vision to Tony Hutchinson in a unique take on A Christmas Carol. Tony later confirmed that it was just as vision, not a ghost, and that he had contacted Jambo in Anglesey who was very much alive. Jambo hasn't been seen since, although in October 2007, Tina McQueen threw a surprise birthday party for her brother-in-law Tony. She invited all the people in his address book, including Jambo. Tony later told Izzy he had known about the party all along because Jambo had sent him a text saying, \\"Thanks for the invitation to your surprise birthday party, Tony, sorry I can't make it.\\". Reception On the character Sky said \\"Way hey... it's Jambo Bolton, do you remember his earring? He was one of the originals and also one of our faves\\". What's on TV placed him in their list of \\"The Top 100 Soap Hunks of All Time\\".

Mascot was formed in 1927 by film producer Nat Levine. In 1936 it merged with several other companies to form Republic Pictures. Mascot's serial The King of the Kongo (1929) was the first serial to include sound, beating Universal Studios by several months. The company's logo featured a roaring tiger resting on top of a model of the planet Earth. Early years Mascot was created by Nat Levine, a former personal secretary to Marcus Loew, in 1927 after the success of his independent serial The Silent Flyer (1926). In the beginning the company operated out of the upstairs offices of a contractor's business on Santa Monica Boulevard. It rented all of its equipment and facilities. In 1929 the studio made serial history with the production of The King of the Kongo. This was the first serial, from any production company, to be made with sound. Mascot's first all-talking production was The Phantom of the West (1931) Sennett Studios It was from small Mascot Pictures, but Ladies Crave Excitement (1935) still packed \\"Bursting Action, Deep Drama...And Up To Date Romance\\" into its 73 minutes. Supervising editor Joseph H. Lewis would soon become a prolific director of B westerns. His later film noirs, including the independently produced Gun Crazy (1949), would become renowned. By 1933 Mascot was successful enough to rent, and later buy, Sennett Studios after the original owner, silent-film comedy producer-director Mack Sennett, went bankrupt because of the Great Depression. This made the company a true film studio. That studio lot is now CBS Studio Center. Mascot was responsible for the popularity of the concept of the \\"singing cowboy\\" and the \\"musical western\\". In 1935 the studio produced The Phantom Empire with the then untried Gene Autry as the lead. Republic Pictures Mascot's film laboratory was Consolidated Film Industries, known today as CFI Industries. In 1935, under pressure from that company's owner, Herbert Yates, Mascot was merged by CFI with Monogram Pictures, Liberty Pictures, Chesterfield Pictures and Invincible Pictures to form Republic Pictures, a production-distribution company designed by Yates. Levine was designated head of the serial and B-Western arm of the company, and the Mascot studio facilities and contract personnel became Republic assets as part of the merger. Within two years, however, along with most of his colleagues at Republic who had owned other companies, Levine found himself in a disagreeable situation and left Republic. With only the Mascot name and film library remaining in his possession, Levine found employment elsewhere in the motion picture industry and Mascot Pictures survived only through reissues of its sound serials and a single, new feature film edited from the \\"Phantom Empire\\" serial, released in 1940.

It was located at Bankplassen by the Akershus Fortress in central Christiania. It was the first lasting public theatre in Norway and the national stage of Norway and of Oslo during the 19th century. History Christiania Theatre was the first long-term public theatre in Oslo. In November 1771 and February 1772, Martin N√ºrenbach made an unsuccessful attempt to start the first public theatre in Oslo. Aside from this, theatre was performed only by the private amateur society Det Dramatiske Selskap at the Gevaexthuset concert hall, which did not offer public performances, and by travelling foreign theatre companies. The first public theatre, the Christiania Offentlige Theater, was inaugurated by the Swedish theatre director Johan Peter Str√∂mberg in January 1827. This was to be the predecessor and origin of the Christiania Theatre. After the building burnt down on 5 November 1835, it was reinstated with the name Christiania Theatre in October 1837. Over next few years, an avid debate developed with strong criticism of the Danish dominancy of the arts. Christiania Theatre only employed Danish actors during its early period, for which it was criticized. The reason given was that there was not an acting school in Norway and that the Norwegian actors were therefore not good enough. The Norwegian language conflict often centered on Norwegian writers who gradually adopted distinctly Norwegian vocabulary in their work. Henrik Wergeland may have been the first to do so. Art critic Johan Sebastian Welhaven was one of the conservatives who took out against the theories of the extreme nationalists. The Danish troupe was eventually mixed up with Norwegian actors after the employment of Norwegian actress and prima donna Laura Gundersen in 1849. The foundation of the first Norwegian theatre in Oslo, Christiania Norwegian Theatre in 1852, was but a temporary rival, as it was forced to close down in 1862. The theatre was created as a counterpoint to the Danish language-dominated Christiania Theatre. Henrik Ibsen was artistic director of the Christiania Norwegian Theatre from the autumn of 1857, and served as the leading director until its bankruptcy in 1862. From 1856, the Christiania Theatre promised to employ native actors. In 1872, Norwegian became the stage language. Ibsen's famous play Peer Gynt premiered here in 1876, as well as a large number of important Norwegian productions, including productions of Norway's other national bard at the time, Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson. During the continued run of Peer Gynt, a fire started on the performing night of 15 January 1877, which heavily damaged the theatre, but luckily, this was later repaired. Christiania Theatre was seen as Norway's national stage for drama until the Nationaltheatret was opened on 1 September 1899, with Bjorn Bjornson as theatre director and a large part of the ensemble from the Christiania Theatre.

Location of the Osaka Conference of 1875 The leaders present included Okubo Toshimichi, Kido Takayoshi, Itagaki Taisuke, Ito Hirobumi, and Inoue Kaoru. In 1873, Itagaki had withdrawn from the government over the Seikanron issue, and was now loudly agitating for representative democracy as the leader of the Freedom and People's Rights Movement. Likewise, in 1874, Kido had withdrawn from the government due to his opposition to the Taiwan Expedition of 1874. The remaining Meiji oligarchs called for a meeting in Osaka in early 1873 in an attempt to reconcile differences and to persuade Itagaki and Kido to return to the government. As concessions, it was agreed that a Senate (Genr≈çin) would be established, along with an Assembly of Prefectural Governors. A new Supreme Court, called the Great Court of Cassation (Daishin-in) would also be established to separate the judiciary from the legislative branches of government. The decisions reached at the Osaka Conference were officially sanctioned by an Imperial Proclamation in April 1875. Although on the surface, the oligarchs appeared to be creating a form of representative assembly, the Genr≈çin and the Assembly of Prefectural Governors were appointive rather than elective, and were dominated by conservative bureaucrats, and in the same year, the first of the Peace Preservation Laws were enacted to suppress the liberal movement.

While much British legislation applied to the United Kingdom as a whole, Scotland and Northern Ireland often had their own versions of the legislation, with slight differences. United Kingdom legislation before 1922 remained in force in the Irish Free State after its independence in that year.  Legislation from predecessor states  At the time of the creation of the United Kingdom in 1801, England, Scotland, and Great Britain had some legislation already in place dealing with the issues of fire safety.  Kingdom of England  As a result of the Great Fire of London, which started on 2 September 1666,Eyewitness accounts it was soon clear that the wooden construction of London's buildings had added greatly to the spread of the fire. As a result, King Charles II issued a proclamation saying that all buildings were to be built out of stone and roads were to be widened. The English government looked at legislation and introduced laws aimed specifically at fire prevention. The London Cooking Fire Bylaw 1705 specifically prohibited open fires in the attics of thatched buildings.  Kingdom of Scotland  Following several fires in Edinburgh in 1698Fire Net History, (Accessed 21 February 2007) an \\"Act Regulating the Manner of Building within the Town of Edinburgh\\" was passed and required that no buildings were to exceed five storeys. Kingdom of Great BritainThe Fires Prevention (Metropolis) Act 1774= The Fires Prevention (Metropolis) Act placed buildings into seven classes, with the required thicknesses of the external and party walls stipulated for each of the classes. It also included provisions stating a maximum floor area for stores and warehouses. The Act brought into being the first legislation that dealt with human life and escape, rather than just building safety. The Act stated that London boroughs were to appoint surveyors and \\"every parish should provide three or more proper ladders of one, two and three storeys high, for assisting persons in houses on fire to escape therefrom\\". United Kingdom legislation= Explosives Act 1875  Under the Explosives Act, many fire brigades took on the responsibility for the safe storage of explosives. The Explosives Act was partly repealed when the Manufacture and Storage of Explosives Regulations 2005 (SI 2005 No. 1082) was brought into being but the inspection and licensing remained much the same.  Petroleum (Consolidation) Act 1928  Under the 1928 Act, the storage of petroleum and petroleum products, whether in underground/above ground tanks or storage cabinets, required a licence issued by the Licensing Authority. In the metropolitan areas, this was the fire authority. In the county authorities, it was the local authority, but usually this was devolved down to the fire service. The Petroleum (Consolidation) Act 1928, as amended by Dangerous Substances and Explosive Atmospheres Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No. 2776), changed the licensing regime and now requires only that anyone operating a petrol filling station have a licence.  Building byelaws and building regulations  Under the London Building Acts 1930-39 powers were granted to make building byelaws and the first set issued in 1938 covered many of the constructional matters previously contained in the earlier Acts. Special powers in London (Section 20 Buildings) were also granted in respect of means of escape from certain new and existing buildings based on their height and use. Outside of London individual local authorities could make local building byelaws under the Public Health Act 1936. However, these local building byelaws were not entirely satisfactory in that local authorities were not obliged to make or adopt them, and many did not. The Public Health Act 1936 was therefore amended by the Public Health Act 1961 to permit the making of one set of national building regulations to replace the 1,400 sets of local byelaws. The first national building regulations for England and Wales were made in 1965. However, they required physical fire safety only for the structure of all new, altered or extended buildings. In 1974 the fire safety scope (of the building regulations in England and Wales) was extended through use of the then new powers given by the Fire Precautions Act 1971, to include minimum safety provisions for means of escape in case of fire. Thus the first building regulations (for England and Wales) to require general fire precautions for the safe means of escape in case of fire were made in 1974. In practice, these \\"m-o-e\\" building regulations drew in large part upon the design guidance and recommendations of the then rather oddly titled \\"CP3 Chapter 4 \\"Code of Practice for Means of Escape in Buildings\\", issued by the BSI (British Standards Institute) in 1971. Building regulations (England and Wales) were not retrospective in their effect. Therefore, when minimum fire safety measures were improved in revised issues of the building regulations documents, existing buildings were not required to adopt these new minimum standards unless they were being altered or extended. Thus \\"as originally built\\" buildings were exempt from the new rules from 1974 until the advent of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005. This order requires adequate and sufficient general fire precautions suitable for the current users and use, of any given building, to be provided by the responsible person for each building. This did lead to a rather unsatisfactory mishmash of fire safety in the English and Welsh building stock. The Fire Safety Order 2005 now requires the responsible person for each building to carry out or commission from a competent person a fire risk assessment to ensure that the general fire precautions within a particular building are fit for the purposes that that building is being currently put to. The current use of an old building by today's occupiers and users has to be taken into account, in arriving at the appropriate general fire precautions. Thus both proportionate and appropriate remedial \\"fire safety\\" works may be necessary to discharge the responsible persons legal duty, to control or reduce the risk to life from fire in a building.  Factories Act 1937  In 1937 the Factories Act 1901 was extended to cover means of escape in case of fire. The Act required that the factory owner have a plan of escape in case of fire and brought in the first rudimentary fire certificates.  Fire Services Act 1947  Before 1947, issues of fire safety were in the hands of the local authority, and the legal enforcement of issues under the Factories Act and Office Shops and Railway Premises Act were dealt with by the local authority, having usually devolved this down to the fire brigade. The introduction of the Fire Services Act 1947Ministry of Justice: Fire Services Act 1947 c41 (accessed 18 May 07) gave the fire brigade its first responsibilities for fire safety. Section 1 of the Fire Services Act defined the duties of a fire brigade and further went to say under section 1, sub- section 1 paragraph F, commonly referred to as 11(F), that a fire brigade must give advice and assistance on matters of fire prevention if so requested by any person. The Act did not however give any other powers to the fire brigade in terms of inspection and enforcement.  Factories Act 1961  A fire at the Eastwood Mills, Keighley, Yorkshire in February 1956, in which 8 people died, resulted in the Act being further amended in 1959 giving the fire brigades the power to inspect factories for fire safety. Finally in 1961 the Act was re-written to consolidate all the changes. The fire certificates were also updated to include not only means of escape but also provision for fighting fire and structural fire separation.  Licensing Act 1961  On 1 May 1961, a fire occurred at the Top Storey Club in Bolton,Bolton Evening News, 2 May 1961 which resulted in the deaths of nineteen people. Fourteen died in the building, and five were killed attempting to jump out of windows into the canal that ran alongside the building. The Licensing Act 1961 was almost immediately amended to update the requirements for safety in case of fire.  Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act 1963  In June 1960, a fire broke out in the William Henderson & Sons, Liverpool department store. Ten people were trapped in the fourth floor and one man fell to his death whilst assisting others to safety from a window ledge. This fire prompted the Government to amend the Office Shops and Railway Premises Act (OSRA) in line with the Factories Act 1961 and in 1963 a new OSRA was introduced  Fire Precautions Act 1971  (Repealed, for England and Wales, by the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 on 1 October 2006) On Boxing Day 1969, a fire at the Rose and Crown Hotel, Saffron WaldenHotel Fire Safety (Accessed 20 February 2007) killed eleven people whilst seventeen were rescued. The fire prompted the Government to look at the whole structure of fire safety legislation and in 1971, the Fire Precautions ActWarrington Fire Research was passed into law. This act combined the fire sections of the Factories Act and the Office Shops and Railway Premises Act and brought in new premises like hotels. This was an open designating act, and it contained a wide list of premises types from which the Secretary of State could select specific premises types to be covered by statutory instrument. The responsibility for enforcing the Act fell on the fire service, except in civil Crown premises, where Her Majesty's Inspectors of Fire Service (HMIFS) carried out the enforcement. The Fire Precautions Act 1971 came into force in 1972, when hotels and boarding houses were the first class of premises to be designated. Under the Fire Precautions (Hotels and Boarding Houses) Order 1972, Statutory Instrument (SI) 1972 /238) (and an equivalent Order for Scotland), any premises where there was sleeping accommodation for more than six persons (staff or guests), or any sleeping accommodation above the first floor or below the ground floor, required a fire certificate issued by the fire authority. The Fire Precautions (Factories, Offices, Shops and Railways Premises) Order 1976, (revoked in 1989 by SI 1989/76), further designated premises to require fire certificates for factories, offices, shops and railway premises: *Where more than 20 persons are employed *Where more than 10 persons are employed elsewhere than the ground floor *In factories, where explosives or highly flammables are stored or used in or under the premises. The Fire Precautions Act 1971 was amended in 1987 by the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987, by laying down stipulations that the occupier of the premises must take into consideration. These were known as interim arrangements, and the occupier, having made an application for a fire certificate, now had a duty to ensure that *the means of escape can be safely and effectively used at all material times *the means of fire fighting are maintained in efficient working order, and *all people employed to work in the premise should receive instructions and have training in what action to take in the event of a fire. Premises that fell outside of these rules did not have to have a fire certificate but had to provide limited fire safety by virtue of Section 9A of the Act. The 1971 Act gave power to the fire authority to apply to the court to prohibit the use of premises if they were dangerous and there was a serious risk of imminent danger from fire for persons in the premises (prohibition notice). This prohibition power applied widely to all manner of premises but excluded single private dwellings. One of the changes introduced in 1987 was for the fire authority to issue prohibition notices directly, without the need to apply to the court. One major issue with the Act was that fire certification was only ever applied to the designated premises. Places of public entertainment such as cinemas, theatres and nightclubs were never designated so the powers of inspection and enforcement remained with the local authority licensing department. In many areas, the fire brigade carried out the inspections on behalf of the licensing department, but had no powers other than those granted by Section 10 - Prohibition Notice. The Fire Precautions Act 1971 and its \\"Fire Certificates\\" were totally repealed and replaced by the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, which came into full force on 1 October 2006 (in England and Wales).  The Fire Precautions (Factories, Offices, Shops and Railway Premises) Regulations 1976  The Fire Precautions (Factories, Offices, Shops and Railway Premises) Regulations 1976, gave some updates to the FPA and cleared several points about self-employed workers, the numbers of hours worked (part-time workers) and how aggregation of these could be used to bring some \\"grey\\" premises into the scope of requiring a fire certificate. It also brought in exemptions from the requirement to have a fire certificate in certain small premises. (These regulations were revoked in 1989; see below.)  Fire Certificates (Special Premises) Regulations 1976  (Revoked by the RR (Fire Safety) Order 2005 for England and Wales; see below.) Following several small fires in chemical plants and a major explosion and fire at the Nypro plant in Flixborough on 1 June 1974,HSE Flixbourgh Report the Government decided to require fire certificates for major chemical and other risks and to give enforcement to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). It issued the Fire Certificates (Special Premises) Regulations 1976 (SI 1976/2003), enforced by the HSE on a similar line to the Fire Precautions Act 1971. These regulations were brought in to require premises having over a threshold quantity or using certain named hazardous substances to possess a fire certificate. The regulations applied to whole sites rather than the single premise or building approach used in the Fire Precautions Act 1971. These regulations also applied to temporary buildings associated with construction work. Fire certificates were required for some of these buildings, and there were some fire safety obligations generally imposed in respect of those temporary buildings, which did not require a fire certificate. (These regulations were revoked by the RR (Fire Safety) Order 2005 for England and Wales; see below.)  Building Act 1984  In England and Wales, the powers to make building regulations were consolidated and re- enacted in 1984. All building regulations made by the Secretary of State since then have included minimum fire safety measures (for both physical fire resistance and safe means of escape) for all new, extended or altered buildings. The current building regulation's fire safety documents were last revised and issued in 2006. See Approved Document - Part B - Fire Safety Vol 1 & 2 (available to download free from the UK Government's \\"Planning Portal\\" website).bcfiresafetypartb A major simplification and enlargement of the scope of the English and Welsh fire safety laws was implemented by the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (RR (FS)O 2005, in force 1 October 2006). The new Fire Safety Order again amended and extended the scope of fire safety provision within the Building Regulations 2000. Building Regulation (Reg.16B) now require a developer or architect to hand over sufficient fire safety information to the building's future responsible person, so he may commission an appropriate fire risk assessment for the new building and its occupiers and/or users. Note: building regulations and fire safety laws are different, but similar, in Scotland and Northern Ireland.  Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987  (Modified and partially replaced by the RR (Fire Safety) Order 2005; see below.) Following a fire on 11 May 1985 at the Bradford City football groundBBC - On this Day in which 56 people died a committee was set up to examine the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. They recommended that the Act be rewritten as the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act. The Act did not replace the Fire Precautions Act but gave more powers to the local building control authority and fire authority. These powers included the power to charge for the issue of a fire certificate. (Modified and partially replaced by the RR (Fire Safety) Order 2005; see below.)  Fire Precautions (Sub-surface Railway Stations) Regulations 1989  (Repealed and replaced, for England, in 2010 by regulations made under RR (FS)O 2005.) These precautions followed a serious fire at the King's Cross Underground StationFire Tactics on 18 November 1987,BBC - On this day which resulted in the loss of 31 lives, including Station Officer Colin Townsley of the London Fire Brigade. The Fire Precautions (Sub-surface Railway Stations) Regulations 1989 (SI 1989/1401) were made under Section 12 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971 and were brought into effect on 18 September 1989. (Replaced in 2010 by regulations made under RR (FS) O 2005.)  Fire Precautions (Workplace) Regulations 1997  (Revoked by the RR (Fire Safety) Order 2005 for England and Wales; see below.) In the early 1990s, the government was required to implement several European directives including one on fire safety. This was at the height of deregulation and the government, architects, commerce and industry considered that fire brigades were too inflexible and demanded belt and braces solutions. They and the directive called for a new approach to fire safety and demanded a cheaper and more flexible system. They decided the prescriptive method used by the fire service should be replaced by a more flexible fire risk assessment approach and consequently the Fire Precautions (Workplace) Regulations 1997 (SI 1997/1840) was placed on the statute books using section 12 of the 1971 Act. They also wanted the responsibility of implementing the legislation to be removed from the fire service and placed on the employers, but the fire service would be the enforcing authority for the legislation. It was implemented using the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations, 1992 (MHSAW) (replaced in 1999). These regulations differed from the previous fire safety legislation in that they introduced the concept of risk assessment in a style similar to the Health and Safety at Work Etc. Act 1974. The workplace regulations also brought in a new form of enforcement of the legislation. Under the Fire Precautions Act, Section 10 gave the fire brigade the power to close a premises if there was serious danger from fire; however, there was very little they could do to bring a premises up to standard. Section 4 of the Fire Precautions Act did give some limited powers to issue a 'Notice of Steps' to be taken to correct any defects. The workplace regulations brought in a new enforcement method, the 'improvement notice'. This allowed the enforcing authority to serve notice of any defects and give a reasonable time scale as to when the work should be completed; failure to complete the work in that time could result in prosecution. (Revoked by the RR (Fire Safety) Order 2005 for England and Wales; see below.)  The Fire Precautions (Workplace) (Amendment) Regulations 1999  (Repealed and totally replaced by the RR (Fire Safety) Order 2005; see below.) The Fire Precautions (Workplace) (Amendment) Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999/1877) were a result of European Communities Act 1972. They brought the UK legislation up to a standard that met the fire safety requirements of two health and safety European Directives, 89/391/EECCouncil Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work and 89/654/EEC,Council Directive 89/654/EEC of 30 November 1989 concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the workplace (first individual directive within the meaning of Article 16 (1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) adopted in 1989. The amendments were laid before Parliament on 7 July 1999 and became law on 1 December 1999. Unfortunately, they did not revoke sections 5 to 9 of the Fire Precautions Act, which required fire certificates; consequently, the legislation now ran in parallel with the Workplace Regulations but secondary to it. Employers or persons having overall control of the workplace were made responsible under the regulations to implement and conduct fire safety risk assessments, also produce a record if they employ more than five people. The Fire Brigades enforce the regulations and conduct limited inspections to ensure employers are carrying out their responsibilities.  Licensing Act 2003  (Modified by the RR (Fire Safety) Order 2005; see below.) 'Licensed premises' covered a number of types of establishment, including places where alcohol was sold or consumed, theatres, cinemas and places of entertainment. Many of these premises fell outside the scope of the Fire Precautions Act 1971 but had their own legislation, such as the Theatres Act and the Cinemas Act, which contained within them, their own fire regulations. Most of these acts have now been amended or repealed and their fire precautions now fall under the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2006 or Licensing Act 2003. The Licensing Act 2003 introduced a requirement for licences to sell or supply alcohol, provide regulated entertainment or provide late night refreshment with the licence holder serving notice of application directly upon the fire and rescue authority. This amended or repealed much of the old licensing legislation, including Theatres Act 1968, Cinemas Act 1985, Gaming Acts 1968 & 1990 and Licensing Act 1964. Laws such as the Local Government Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1976 were major legislation but contain sections covering fire safety of some outdoors events, private film shows, neon signs and some licensed premises that fell outside the scope of the 2003 Act. There were also numerous local Acts such as the Greater Manchester Act 1981, which give the fire brigade powers to control flammable stacks, night cafes and licence underground car parks. The old acts (repealed by RR (FS) O 2005 1 October 2006) that controlled licensing caused much confusion as there were conflicts in who enforced the various parts of the legislation and where it was to be enforced. Licensed premises (pubs, clubs, cinemas, theatres) were classed as providing a service, not as shops, and so did not normally fall within the designated groups in the FPA, so some never needed fire certificates. However, the local authority who issued the licence usually asked the fire brigade to inspect plans and carry out inspections, which led to confusion even by fire safety officers. Coupled with all this, materials such as celluloid have been recognised as highly flammable since early days of its usage,HSE Fact Sheets and acts such as the Celluloid and Cinematograph Films Act 1922 and the Cinematograph Act 1952 gave the fire brigade powers to take samples of film and test them for flammability even though they were not the enforcing authority. Other licensing legislation such as the licensing of underground car parks by means of a local act such as the Greater Manchester Act applied where local acts existed so one authority licensed and the next one did not. There were also arguments about definitions of shops etc., further confusing the issues.  Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004  The Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 (England and Wales - see below) laid out in Section 6 what the fire service must do in relation to fire safety. It states that a fire and rescue authority must make provision for the purpose of promoting fire safety in its area not only by the enforcement of specific fire safety legislation but also by a proactive strategy targeted at all sections of the community by: * provision of information, publicity and encouragement in respect of the steps to be taken to prevent fires and death or injury by fire * giving of advice on request on how to prevent fires and restrict their spread in buildings and other property and the means of escape from buildings and other property in case of fire. This meant that the service has had to change its fire safety strategies and now include public education as well as legal enforcement. All fire and rescue services today have specialist departments dealing with community fire safety education. The job of these departments is to educate by talking to school children and vulnerable areas of the community and to assist the public, with many FRS running campaigns, offering free smoke detectors as part of the drive to reduce deaths in the home.  Housing Act 2004  This Act reformed (and expanded) the former narrow \\"unfitness standard\\", and gave (in England and Wales) all Environmental Health Officers strong enforcement powers, to inspect any dwelling (rented, leased, owner-occupied, or what ever) for the 23 defined \\"hazards\\". This is known as the \\"Housing Health and Safety Rating System\\" (HHSRS) toolbox. An EHO may order the removal of any of these hazards where it is a \\"Cat 1\\" risk to the dwellings occupier(s). EHOs can enforce non-action and carry out remedial works, and recharge the dwelling with the costs. Owners of dwellings can also be prosecuted for any of the 23 defined hazards. \\"Fire safety\\" is one of the defined hazards. EHOs may use their powers on single- family dwellings independently from the fire authority's powers under the Fire Safety order 2005, to require adequate and sufficient fire safety measures in existing dwellings. This carries on the long British legal tradition, which started with the Housing Act of 1875, that owners and/or occupiers may not put anyone in danger by their actions or inactions, and must act to protect their neighbours. If they fail to so, the local council's EHOs have a duty to consider taking appropriate legal action to protect the community at large. (Womack and Bone LLP)  Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005  In 2000, the Government in the form of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (OPDM) set up a review of the fire safety legislation led by the Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott MP and found that there were some 80 Statement by the Deputy Prime Minister, 19 April 2004 Acts of Parliament or parts of Acts which specified fire safety legislation. In order to revamp the whole thing and bringing it up to date, they decided to place all the odd bits of fire legislation under the umbrella of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005,The Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, England & Wales, SI 2005/1541, Crown copyright, (accessed 23 Feb 07) which became law in October 2006. It applies to England and Wales only. The major change in the legislation was that it brought in the concept of risk assessment rather than prescriptive codes. The Fire Precautions Act had relied on codes and guides for its implementation, and the Fire Precautions (Workplace) Regulations had changed that a little by introducing risk assessment as a way of complying, but because the requirement for a fire certificate was never repealed, the guides and codes were still used as a prescriptive means of applying the law. The RR (FS) O took this one step further and implemented fully a risk assessment based regime. The Fire Safety Order lays out the foundation of the fire risk assessmenthttp://www.lrbconsulting.co.uk/blog/fire-safety-risk- assessment/ by saying that the responsible person (employer, person in control of the building, or the owner) must take into account for the safety of their employees and anyone else who may lawfully be on or near their premises. The following must be provided (to protect their employees and anyone else who may lawfully be on or near the premises): * means of detection and giving warning in case of fire * the provision of means of escape * the provision of emergency lighting to escape routes * means of fighting fire (where necessary) * the training of staff in fire safety * the publication of an \\"emergency plan\\" and the \\"fire safety procedures\\" for a specific building The Fire Safety Order then tells the responsible person (employer, person in control of the building, or owner) how they must assess these items in order to protect their employees and anyone else who may lawfully be on or near their premises. *carry out a fire risk assessment of the workplace and communal areas in blocks of flats or maisonettes *identify the significant findings of the risk assessment and the details of anyone who might be at risk in case of fire; under the Management of Health and Safety Regulations, these must be recorded if more than five persons are employed *provide and maintain such fire precautions as are necessary to safeguard those who use the workplace *provide information, instruction and training to employees about the fire precautions in the workplace The Fire Safety Order 2005 now requires the responsible person for each building to carry out or commission from a competent person a Fire Risk Assessment to ensure that the general fire precautions within a particular building are fit for the purposes that that building is being currently put to. The current use of an old building by today's occupiers and users has to be taken into account, in arriving at the appropriate general fire precautions. Thus, both proportionate and appropriate remedial \\"fire safety\\" works may be necessary to discharge the responsible person's legal duty, to control or reduce the risk to life from fire in a building. (Womack & Bone LLP) = The wider scope of UK fire safety law 1 October 2006 = The Fire Safety Order 2005 applies to most buildings and sites, except for private dwellings, though the FSO does apply to communal areas/escape routes serving dwellings. The fire authority is the principal enforcing authority. However, there are other enforcing authorities - the Health and Safety Executive for most construction sites and on ships under construction, the Defence Fire and Rescue Service for defence premises, the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) for nuclear sites, and the local authority for sports grounds. = Enforcement = The ongoing audit and 'enforcement' of both the required \\"Fire Risk Assessments\\" and the necessary 'General Fire Precautions' in any premise subject to the Fire Safety Order 2005, are the legal duty on the local fire authority. Fire authorities should follow up on their audit and inspection of any premises and they may order additional fire precautions or even issue a prohibition notice, to prevent the use of a very dangerous building. Fire authorities can also issue informal \\"action plans\\" or issue informal \\"notice of fire safety deficiencies\\" letters. Failure of the responsible person to implement a Fire Risk Assessment's recommendations, or to follow (within the time limit specified by the fire authority) up on a fire authority's informal \\"Action Plan\\" or \\"NFSD\\" letter, will usually lead to a formal enforcement order being issued. If the enforcement notice or prohibition notice is ignored, then court action for these criminal offenses will be taken by the local fire authority. Crown Courts may imprison the responsible person for up to two years for each breach of any of the Fire Safety Order's articles, and/or impose fines of up to ¬£10,000 for each breach of any of the Fire Safety Order's articles, on individuals. Crown Courts may impose unlimited fines on any company, breaching the requirements and legal duties imposed by the Fire Safety Order 2005. Fines of ¬£300,000 to ¬£400,000 have already been imposed on two major companies for their corporate fire safety failings under the RR (FS) O 2005. In addition, to these fines, the legal costs of bringing the successful prosecution may also be recovered from the convicted 'fire criminal'. HHSRS - One should not forget the parallel powers of each local council's EHO (Environmental Health Officer) to enforce fire safety within both single dwellings and in blocks of flats and buildings providing 'Housing in Multiple Occupation' (HMO), under their Housing Act 2004 (HHSRS/\\"unfittness\\") powers. \\"Owners of HMOs may need a renewable licence to operate, from the local authority EHO.\\" Enforcement Concordat - A fire authority may and sometimes does pass a fire safety complaint over to the local housing authority. \\"Beds in sheds\\" - English fire authorities have recently started to prosecute owners and operators of illegally built or converted \\"dwellings\\" in non-habitable buildings, such as 'domestic garages in gardens' and disused offices, public houses, factories, under the Fire Safety Order 2005. = \\"Name and shame\\" = Fire authorities in England and Wales are legally required to publish the (responsible person's) name and the premises address, for which they have issued an enforcement notice, an alterations notice, or a prohibition notice, under the powers given to them by the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005. Many fire authorities have put these lists on their websites. Most fire authorities' \\"name and shame\\" lists also indicate which \\"notices\\" are \\"still outstanding\\" or \\"now complied with\\". For example, see the London Fire Brigade website.http://www.london- fire.gov.uk/Notices.asp (Womack & Bone LLP) = Penalties = Enforcement action has been taken by many fire authorities. Several owners, and landlords have been taken to court, and heavily fined. A growing number of landlords have been jailed, for persistent breaches of the Fire Safety Order. Crown Courts may imprison the responsible person for up to two years for each breach of any of the Fire Safety Order's articles, and/or impose fines of up to ¬£10,000 for each breach of any of the Fire Safety Order's articles, on individuals. Crown Courts may impose Unlimited fines on any company, breaching the requirements and legal duties imposed by the Fire Safety Order 2005. Fines of ¬£300,000 to ¬£400,000 have already been imposed on two major companies for their corporate fire safety failings under the RR (FS) O 2005. In addition to these fines, the legal costs of bringing the successful prosecution may also be recovered from the convicted 'fire criminal'. Every \\"real\\" fire is now followed up by the local fire authority's fire safety inspectors. = Case law = The English Court of Appeal, on 16 June 2010, upheld a Crown Court's fine of ¬£400,000 (with additional legal costs of ¬£150,000) against New look Retailers Ltd. Following a major fire in the New Look Oxford Street shop, whilst no one was hurt, the building was lost and Oxford Street was closed for two days. = Scotland and Northern Ireland = The equivalent legislation in Scotland to the Regulatory Reform Order is the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005. Its scope (in Scotland) covers what the RRO and the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 covers in England and Wales.Fire (Scotland) Act 2005, Crown copyright, (accessed 23 Feb 07) Part 3 of the act deals specifically with fire safety. In October 2006, the Fire Safety (Scotland) Regulations 2006 SI 456 also came into effect.The Fire Safety (Scotland) Regulations 2006 SSI 2006/456, Crown copyright, (accessed 23 Feb 07) Legislation in Scotland relating to fire and rescue services and fire safety comes under the auspices of the Scottish Government. In Northern Ireland, the equivalent legislation is the Fire and Rescue Services (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 SI No 1254 (NI9)Fire and Rescue Services (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 SI 2006/1254 (NI9), Crown copyright (accessed 19 Feb 2007) (it is a statutory instrument).

This allowed members of any caste practising marumakkatayam (matriliny) in Malabar to register a sambandham as a marriage. It was permissive rather than restrictive law: whether or not a relationship was registered was entirely the decision of the people involved in that relationship. Initiated by the work of Sir C. Sankaran Nair, the measure was largely a failure, with Panikkar noting that in the 20 years following introduction of the Act only six such relationships were registered and that all of those involved family members of Nair himself. Sambandham and marumakkatayam Sambandham was a form of relationship practiced by the Nair caste. Anthropologist Christopher Fuller has said that, \\"The Nayars' marriage system has made them one of the most famous of all communities in anthropological circles\\". Thomas Nossiter has commented that their system, which included the pre-pubertal thalikettu kalyanam rite and permitted both hypergamy and a form of polyandry, \\"was so loosely arranged as to raise doubts as to whether 'marriage' existed at all.\\" Men and women could both have several partners, and they could both break away from those partners and take other partners with a minimum of effort. The sambandham relationship was not recognised by the British colonial government, who saw it as akin to concubinage. The civil courts refused jurisdiction, principally because the relationship could so easily be dissolved by either party to it and because there were no rights of property connected to it. The dominant position that the Nambudiri Brahmins held over the region, due to their overwhelming control of landholdings, was seen by those outside the caste system as providing a means for Nambudiri men to gain sexual access to women from the lower-ranked Nair community. Marumakkatayam was also a source of angst among the colonial administrators. Movement for change Expressions of dissatisfaction with marumakkatayam became prominent in newspapers of the 1870s and 1880s, and were also voiced by the colonial administrator William Logan in an official report of that period. Matters came to a head in 1890 when Nair introduced a bill seeking legitimisation of the customs in the Madras Legislative Council, causing the administration to establish the Malabar Marriage Commission in 1891. This was to investigate matrilineal customs and was also charged with recommending whether or not legal measures should be used to effect changes to the traditional practices for marriage, family organisation and inheritance.

It marked the first time the Council had referred a situation to the Court, and also compelled a country to co-operate with it. Sudan, which is not a permanent member of the ICC under the Rome Statute, refuses to recognise the court's jurisdiction, stated that \\"the International Criminal Court has no place in this crisis at all.\\" Adoption The resolution was adopted by 11 votes to none against and four abstentions from Algeria, Brazil, China and the United States. The Algerian representative preferred an African Union-devised solution to the problem, Brazil agreed with the resolution but objected to the U.S. view on selective jurisdiction of the Court, the Chinese representative disagreed with some elements of the ICC Statute and argued for the perpetrators to be tried in Sudanese courts, and the United States objected to some provisions of the Court but overall supported humanitarian interests and the fight against impunity. Resolution Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council referred the situation since 1 July 2002 to the ICC and urged all states to co-operate with the Court, whether or not it was party to the Rome Statute. The ICC and African Union were invited to discuss the practicalities of proceedings relating to the conflict, while the ICC was encouraged to promote the rule of law, human rights and combat impunity in Darfur. The resolution also emphasised the importance of reconciliation, through the creation of truth commissions for example. Nationals from a state other than Sudan which did not recognise the jurisdiction of the Court would instead be subject to the jurisdiction of that state for acts related to Sudan.

The lake was developed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in 1969 by impounding the Green River. The dam is an 11-mile drive equidistant from the cities of Campbellsville and Columbia. The lake is located 90 miles southeast of Louisville. Operated and maintained primarily for flood control, the lake has become the major attraction of Green River Lake State Park. Green River Lake Dam The earthen dam (National ID # KY03007, at ), owned and operated by the Corps of Engineers, stands 144 feet high, with a length of 2350 feet at its crest. Its riverine reservoir has a normal surface area of , a maximum capacity of , and normal storage of .

It was the first to feature Frank Thornton as new third man leader Herbert \\"Truly of the Yard\\" Truelove. The episode also marked the final appearance of Foggy. The Trio in this episode was Compo (Bill Owen), Clegg (Peter Sallis) and Truly (Frank Thornton). Synopsis Compo and Clegg are off to a stag night where they encounter Herbert Truelove \\"Truly of the Yard\\" an old school friend, who has retired from the Police force. The men, including the groom, Ronnie, Barry and Foggy have had too much to drink and Truly rings Wesley for a lift. At Clegg's house, Truly recalls his married life to the former Mrs Truelove. The picture being far from rosy puts Ronnie off getting married. The next morning Barry & Ronnie, still suffering from hangovers, are helping Compo, Clegg and Truly by carrying Foggy into the back of Wesley's Landrover still feeling worse for wear from the stag night. They drop off Barry at his & Glenda's house before dropping off Ronnie to get ready for the wedding. But the groom gets frightened when Truly begins his stories of marriage again and does a bunk on a milk float. Foggy, meanwhile, is taken in by the post lady who offers to look after him. Smiler can't work out what to buy for a wedding present and ends up with a vase from Auntie Wainwright's - which he promptly get his hand stuck in. Compo, Clegg and Truly eventually catch up with Ronnie, who's chained himself to a road sign in the hills. They carry him and the sign into Wesley's Land Rover but are stopped by the Police for stealing the sign. Barry's in a panic because he can't find the wedding ring. He remembers giving it to Foggy but he's disappeared. A neighbour tells him the post lady took Foggy away in her car. Collecting Ronnie from the police station, Truly handcuffs Ronnie to himself and they go to Compo's house to show him what a bachelor pad look like in the hope it will encourage him to get married. Ronnie rather likes it! Next they enlist the help of Marina, who poses as a gypsy and warns Ronnie of the bad life he'll have if he doesn't get married. He finally succumbs. As the ceremony is about to begin, Clegg gets a phone call from Foggy saying he is in Blackpool and that he has remembered the ring and has proposed to the post lady. Trivia Originally Truly was meant to be a stand in character for Brian Wilde's character of Foggy Dewhurst as, just before filming began on the 1997 Christmas special, Wilde suffered from a mild infection in his leg which he said he knew would stop him from taking part and recommended Frank Thornton to be the new third man leader. But then, owing to a scheduling problem at the BBC, this meant Wilde (who was by then fully fit), was unable to take part and Thornton ended up becoming Wilde's permanent replacement, as well as doing all the episodes of the 19th series. While Foggy appears in this episode, his face isn't shown and a body double (Colin Harris) was used in far away shots where he is seen being carried out of the stag night celebration and being put into the back of Wesley Pegden's Land Rover to conceal Brian Wilde's absence from the show.

Faulkner is a singer-songwriter, guitarist and keyboardist; he has performed with several bands, but is best known as a member of Hoodoo Gurus. He wrote the band's best known single, 1987 hit \\"What's My Scene?\\", which reached No. 3 on the National charts. As the mainstay member of Hoodoo Gurus, Faulkner gave the acceptance speech when they were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association Hall of Fame on 18 July 2007 at the Plaza Ballroom, Melbourne. Faulkner was one of the new entries in the 2007 edition of Who's Who in Australia. Early life and career Faulkner's father, Martin Faulkner was a World War II veteran who served in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) and survived the sinking of HMAS Canberra I during the Battle of Savo Island. Faulkner's mother Ruth was a tireless community worker and local politician, serving as a councillor for the City of Belmont, a local government district of Perth in which the Faulkner family lived. In 1968, she was the first woman elected to the Shire of Belmont and served as Deputy Shire President. She was instrumental in creation of the City of Belmont's public library, which is named for her, as is the park in which the council offices are located. Faulkner was educated at Perth's Trinity College. Faulkner, aka Dave Flick, along with James Baker and Dave Cardwell (aka Rudolph V) were founding members of punk band The Victims in 1977. Baker and Faulkner co-wrote the band's first single \\"Television Addict\\", which is regarded as one of Australia's great punk rock songs and has featured on several punk compilations. After The Victims split in 1979, Faulkner played keyboards with another Perth band The Manikins, who also performed some of his songs. Hoodoo Gurus Dave Faulkner Apr 2012 at Rottnest in front of the Hoodoo Gurus In 1981, Baker and Faulkner founded Le Hoodoo Gurus in Sydney with Roddy Radalj and Kimble Rendall: their first single was \\"Leilani\\" (1982). As Hoodoo Gurus, the band enjoyed success in many countries without having a major international hit. They released eight original albums and several compilations, and officially split in 1998, but reformed in 2003. Faulkner also wrote original music for films Broken Highway (1993) and The Sum of Us (1994). His song for Hoodoo Gurus \\"Come Anytime\\" (June 1989) is the theme song to the Australian television show Thank God You're Here (2006). The Gurus reworked their hit, \\"What's My Scene?\\" as \\"That's My Team\\" also by Faulkner, the 2003‚Äì2007 promotional theme for the National Rugby League (NRL). Faulkner is a well-known, long-time supporter of NRL team the Cronulla Sharks and appeared in one of their jerseys for the \\"That's My Team\\" promotional song video (a lyrics rewrite of \\"What's My Scene?\\"). Faulkner had also written \\"1000 Miles Away\\" (1991) which was adopted as the 'anthem' for RAN frigate HMAS Canberra II, Hoodoo Gurus played a concert including \\"1000 Miles Away\\" on-board (in front of both Canberra I and II veterans including Faulkner's father) during their last voyage out of Fremantle to Fleet Base West, prior to its decommissioning in 2005. In September 2001, Faulkner, together with fellow Hoodoo Gurus members Rick Grossman, Mark Kingsmill and Brad Shepherd, performed as The Moops (later called Persian Rugs). At Homebake 2001, (8 December) both Hoodoo Gurus and Persian Rugs performed separate sets. Just after Persian Rugs recorded a five- track EP Mr. Tripper (June 2002) Grossman left the band, with Shepherd then recommending bassist Kendall James as his replacement (ex Thurston Howlers, Crusaders). With the addition of James, Persian Rugs recorded their debut album Turkish Delight, which was released in August 2003. Persian Rugs provided the track \\"Be My Guru\\" for the Hoodoo Gurus' tribute album Stoneage Cameos (2005) (see Stoneage Romeos) but by that time Hoodoo Gurus, with Grossman on bass, had already reformed and released Mach Schau (2004).

He was educated at Ebury School, Shoreditch College and Sussex University. He joined the London Oratory School as an Assistant Master for Mathematics at the age of 21 in 1967, was promoted to Deputy Headmaster in 1971 and was appointed Headmaster in 1977. Career A report by the Sutton Trust on university admissions in 2006 reported that of the 100 schools with the highest admission rates to Oxford and Cambridge, 80 were independent schools, 18 grammar schools and 2 comprehensive schools. One of the comprehensive schools was 99th; the other ‚Äì The London Oratory ‚Äì was 21st, comfortably ahead of many highly successful and very well known public schools. The table for state school entries to the 13 highest performing universities put the school at number 2, the first place going to a grammar school. While he was headmaster of The London Oratory School, he established a specialist music course for boys from seven to eighteen, which included a liturgical choir which provided a rigorous choral education, equivalent to that otherwise only available in independent cathedral choir schools. He was elected an additional member of the Headmasters Conference (HMC) in 1986. Throughout his career, McIntosh has lobbied for greater autonomy for maintained schools. This was the theme of the paper he presented at the invitation of the then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, at The State of Our Schools at an Education Seminar at Downing Street in 1986. He went on to chair a group which proposed what were to become grant maintained schools. In 1989 The London Oratory School was in the first tranche of schools to opt for grant maintained status. He has frequently found himself at odds with the Catholic Bishops of England and Wales, most notably in 1989, when the Westminster Diocese tried to browbeat his governors and trustees into abandoning the sixth form. More recently he has been at odds with the Bishops over the issue of whether RE should be included in the English Baccalaureate: McIntosh believes that it should not. He fought tenaciously to retain the right to interview applicants for places at the school, a fight which was vindicated by the High Court in 2004, when Mr Justice Rupert Jackson quashed an order made by the Schools Adjudicator ordering the School not to interview. McIntosh was appointed to the think tank, the Centre for Policy Studies Education Group in 1979. Between 1988 and 1991, he served on the Education Advisory Council of the Institute of Economic Affairs. He served on the Health Education Council between 1985 and 1988, and on the National Curriculum Council between 1990 and 1993; and he was a member of the National Curriculum Review Advisory Group between 2011 and 2013. He was an adviser on education to the Leader of Hammersmith & Fulham Council from 2006 until 2012. In 2007‚Äì08 he was a member of the Fulham Schools Commission, established to develop a detailed and coherent strategy for secondary provision in Fulham, the recommendations of which were accepted in full. In 2007‚Äì09 he was responsible for establishing a bilingual (English & French) primary education course involving a partnership between the local authority, the French government, Westminster Diocese and the governing body of a Catholic primary school; he now chairs the Bilingual Management Committee. In 2005 he was appointed Dean and Education Advisor of The Academy of St. Cecilia, of which he is an honorary fellow. He was a member of the Abbot's Advisory Committee at Ampleforth College from 1997 until 2010. He has been a trustee/governor of the governing bodies of several schools in London, including St Philip's Preparatory School, where he was chairman of governors for six years, and the West London Free School. He is a director of the Hackney New School Trust, the honorary president of the West London Free School Trust and a trustee of the English Schools Orchestra and Choir. He served as Vice Chairman of Council at the University of Buckinghamhttps://www.buckingham.ac.uk from 2015 to 2020. In 2020, he was appointed Chairman of Council of the Buckingham International School of Education.https://www.bise.org He was Chairman of the Commission on Assessment Without Levels, which published its report in September 2015. He has been a member of the Catholic Union of Great Britain since 1978.

In April 2018 he was elected an honorary Professor of Professional Practice in Education at the University of Buckingham.  Controversy  Under his headmastership, the London Oratory School was chosen for the education of the children of the Prime Minister, Tony Blair. In 1999, in a letter to 1000 boys at the school, he asked parents to contribute at least ¬£30 a month to cover a ¬£250,000 deficit in the school's budget that he blamed directly on government policy. This was an embarrassment to the government and led to widely reported criticism from Labour politicians and unions.https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/sep/25/labourconference.labour3 Duplicity claim in PM boys' school row  Politics  The Guardian ReferencesExternal links *Academy of St Cecilia home page *The London Oratory School detailed information *Article and photograph on his retirement from London Oratory Heads of schools in England English Roman Catholics Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Schoolteachers from London 1946 births Living people Alumni of the University of Sussex ","title":"John McIntosh (educator)"},{"id":"9647783","text":"Closer Than Ever is a musical revue in two acts, with words by Richard Maltby, Jr. and music by David Shire. The revue contains no dialogue, and Maltby and Shire have described this show as a \\"bookless book musical.\\" The show was originally conceived by Steven Scott Smith as a one act revue entitled Next Time Now!, which was first given at the nightclub Eighty-Eights. The success of Next Time Now! led to a much expanded production retitled Closer Than Ever that was co-directed by Maltby and Smith. This production began its life at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Massachusetts during the Summer of 1989. It came to New York the following Fall, opening in previews on 17 October 1989, and officially opening on 6 November 1989 at the off-Broadway Cherry Lane Theatre, where it ran for 312 performances. The cast included Brent Barrett, Sally Mayes, Richard Muenz, and Lynne Wintersteller. Closer Than Ever features self-contained songs which deal with such diverse topics as security, aging, mid-life crisis, second marriages, working couples, and unrequited love. Maltby and Shire based many of the songs on real-life experiences of their friends, or stories told to them. The revue won the Outer Critics Circle Award for Best Off-Broadway Musical and Maltby, Shire, and Wintersteller all garnered Drama Desk Award nominations for their respective contributions. The original New York cast recorded an album of the revue for RCA Victor (RCA Victor 60399). Revivals The revue has received a number of revivals at Regional theatres throughout the United States, including a production at the Westport Country Playhouse in January 1991, an April 1996 production at the Fleetwood Stage in Mount Vernon, New York, an August 2002 production at the MetroStage in Washington D.C.,Closer Than Ever: MetroStage a 2005 production at the Porchlight Music Theatre in Chicago,Closer Than Ever: Porchlight Music Theatre and a March 2008 production by Charlotte Shakespeare in Charlotte, North Carolina. In September 2006 the show had its London stage debut at the Bridewell Theatre.Closer Than Ever: Bridewell Theatre The production celebrated its 20th anniversary with runs at Queens Theater in the Park and The Bristol Riverside Theatre in April and May 2010; original cast members Wintersteller and Mayes co-starred with Sal Viviano and George Dvorsky, with Maltby and Kurt Stamm co-directing choreography by Stamm. The Shandaken Theatrical Society launched a production that ran from August 14‚Äì21, 2010 directed by Ricarda O'Conner and starred Janna Cardia, Alex Agard, and Austin Ku, Amy Wallace, and Chuck Sokolowski, and with musical director Eric Thomas Johnson. In 2012, Producers Neil Berg and Adam Friedson, in conjunction with The York Theater, revived the show Off-Broadway. The production was co- directed by Richard Maltby Jr. and Kurt Stamm, with Stamm again choreographing, and featured Jenn Colella, George Dvorsky, Christiane Noll, and Sal Viviano. It ran from June to November and was well received by The New York Times and The New Yorker among other major media. It won the 2012/2013 Off Broadway Alliance Award for Best Musical Revival.\\"Off Broadway Alliance Awards\\" Playbill Closer than Ever New Yorker A new cast recording was expected to be released by Jay Records in 2013. Houston's UpStage Theatre opened their 2015‚Äì16 season with a production staged by John Carmona, musical direction by Lucy Cain Hargis, and starring Ruth Calabrese, Michael C. Shivers, Faith Taylor, and Joe Carl White. Composition history In 1984, Maltby began compiling a series of older songs and new song ideas to form an evening of musical short stories, which he labeled the \\"Urban File\\". In particular, he wanted to make use of one of his favorite songs, \\"The Bear, The Tiger, The Hamster, and The Mole\\", which had been cut from Maltby and Shire's 1983 musical Baby. Maltby assembled other cut songs from earlier musicals such as The River, Love Match and The Sap of Life to go with this particular song. The \\"Urban File\\" also contained lyric fragments, musical ideas, song fragments, rhythmic ideas, philosophical observations, and biographical details of friends and acquaintances as potential material for songs. During this time, Maltby was occupied with Song and Dance, and Shire was busy composing film scores, so that the \\"Urban File\\" was not a primary project at the time.Bill Rosenfield, Closer Than Ever 1990 RCA Victor Album liner notes In 1987, Lynne Meadow, artistic director of the Manhattan Theatre Club, approached Maltby and Shire to ask for a song for a topical revue on urban themes that director John Tillinger was creating. Maltby showed them his \\"Urban File\\", which Tillinger and Meadow found appealing. Tillinger had initially planned on only a small amount of music, but after seeing the file, altered his original concept, with the final product being six songs by Maltby and Shire and one song by Edward Kleban. The work was a critical success with both the public and critics. New songs for this production included \\"There's Nothing Like It\\", \\"Miss Byrd\\" and \\"One of the Good Guys\\". They also wrote \\"Three Friends\\" for the revue, but finally did not use it. The music was interspersed with dramatic sketches on urban themes by various playwrights, including Christopher Durang, A. R. Gurney, Terrence McNally, Arthur Miller, Shel Silverstein, Ted Tally, and Wendy Wasserstein. Titled Urban Blight, the revue premiered in May 1988 and ran for six weeks at the Manhattan Theatre Club. The cast included Larry Fishburne, John Rubinstein, Oliver Platt, Nancy Giles, Faith Prince, Rex Robbins and E. Katherine Kerr. In the Fall of 1988, the playwright and director and pianist Steven Scott Smith, an assistant to Maltby, approached Maltby and Shire for permission to use the \\"Urban File,\\" with some other unused songs of theirs, to assemble a cabaret evening consisting entirely of their music. Maltby and Shire approved this, and Smith began to assemble a review titled Next Time, Now! with director Patrick Scott Brady and choreographer Arthur Faria. One of the songs added into this show was \\"Life Story.\\" The one-hour cabaret show opened in January 1989 at Eighty-Eight's, a nightclub in Greenwich Village, with Brent Barrett, Michael Brian and Lynne Wintersteller as the show's performers. The work was a critical success with both the public and critics, and Maltby and Shire decided to expand this product into a full evening-length show. Maltby and Shire received support to expand the show when producers Janet Brenner, Michael Gill, and Daryl Roth came on board. They wanted to turn the production into a two act evening, which required new songs and additional material from the \\"Urban File.\\" The show also added one more actress, Sally Mayes, to the cast. New songs written for the expansion include the opening number, \\"Doors,\\" \\"You Want To Be My Friend?,\\" \\"Fandango,\\" \\"If I Sing,\\" \\"The March of Time,\\" \\"Back On Base,\\" and the finale, \\"Closer Than Ever.\\" \\"Another Wedding Song,\\" written by Shire and his wife Didi Conn for their wedding, was also added into the show at this time. The full-scale version of the show went through a trial run at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Massachusetts during the summer of 1989. Marcia Milgrom Dodge was hired to choreograph the expanded show and Maltby became Smith's co-director. Well received by audiences, the show headed for New York City.

During his stay in Hamburg from 1833 to 1838, he worked on revising this collection. This herbarium would become the basis for the Flora Capensis (1860‚Äì1865) by his friend, Hamburg botanist Otto Wilhelm Sonder (1812‚Äì1881) in collaboration with the Irish botanist William Henry Harvey (1811‚Äì1866). The herbarium was later sold to Unio Itineraria, a W√ºrttemberg Botanical Society which had been organized by botanist Christian Ferdinand Friedrich Hochstetter (1787‚Äì1860) and physician Ernst Gottlieb von Steudel (1783‚Äì1856). Ecklon received a travel scholarship from the Danish government and in 1829 he went again to the Cape Town where until 1833, together with the German botanist and entomologist, Karl Ludwig Philipp Zeyher (1799‚Äì1858), he collected a sizable herbarium, a large part of which was handed over to the University of Copenhagen and the University of Kiel. From 1833-38, he lived in Hamburg and began the publication of descriptions of South African plants in Enumeratio Plantarum Africae Australis Extratropicae, a descriptive catalogue of South African plants in three parts which appeared (1835-37). In 1838 he traveled again to the Cape where he remained until his death in 1868. Legacy According to IPNI, Ecklon named a total of 1974 different genera or species. The genus Ecklonia, including Ecklon's kelp (Ecklonia biruncinata or E. radiata), as well as Ecklon's Purple Iceplant (Delosperma ecklonis 'Bright Eyes') and Ecklon's Everlasting (Helichrysum ecklonis) were named in his honour. This botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation Eckl. when citing a botanical name. ReferencesOther Sources *William H. Harvey, Otto Wilhelm Sonder, William Turner Thiselton-Dyer (Editor).

History=Merger and creation of INSCOM On 1 January 1977, the United States Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) was organized at Arlington Hall Station, Virginia, to provide the U.S. Army with a single organization for conducting multi-discipline intelligence, security operations, and electronic warfare at the level above corps. The new organization merged the former U.S. Army Security Agency, the signal intelligence and signal security organizations previously located at Arlington Hall, Virginia, the U.S. Army Intelligence Agency, a counterintelligence and human intelligence agency based at Fort Meade, Maryland, and several intelligence production units formerly controlled by the Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence and U.S. Army Forces Command. Brigadier General (later Major General) William I. Rolya, former commanding general of the Army Security Agency, became INSCOM's first commanding general. On 1 October 1977, the former U.S. Army Intelligence Agency headquarters was integrated into INSCOM. The command established a unified intelligence production element, the Intelligence and Threat Analysis Center, on 1 January 1978. Additionally, INSCOM assumed command of three military intelligence groups located overseas: the 66th Military Intelligence Group in Germany, the 470th Military Intelligence Group in Panama, and the 500th Military Intelligence Group in Japan. These groups were transformed into multidisciplinary units by incorporating former Army Security Agency assets into the previously existing elements. A fourth such group, the 501st Military Intelligence Brigade, was soon organized in South Korea. All of these groups were eventually reorganized and re-designated as brigades. Parapsychologic research In association with the Defense Intelligence Agency, and under the leadership of commanding general Albert Stubblebine, INSCOM attempted to use parapsychologic methods such as remote viewing in operation Center Lane. This was done as late as 1981. Other U.S. intelligence services attempted similar projects during the same period, most notably the Stargate Project by the Central Intelligence Agency.

The song declared that all the artists involved would refuse to perform at Sun City, a resort which was located within the bantustan of Bophuthatswana, one of a number of internationally unrecognized states created by the South African government to forcibly relocate its black population. Recording Van Zandt was interested in writing a song about South Africa's Sun City casino resort, to make parallels with the plight of Native Americans. Danny Schechter, at the time a journalist with ABC News' 20/20, suggested that the song should be a different kind of \\"We Are the World\\", or as Schechter explained, \\"a song about change not charity, freedom not famine.\\" As Van Zandt was writing it, Schechter suggested that he include the names of the artists who had played Sun City in defiance of a United Nations-sanctioned cultural boycott. \\"I was probably still thinking of 20/20's expos√© of conservative Africanists 15 years earlier\\", says Schechter. References to specific performers who had played in Sun City appeared in the demo but were omitted from the final version. Paul Simon declined to contribute, as he felt the list of names was inappropriate: \\"You've got to give people a chance to say, 'I shouldn't have done that.'\\" Among the names was Simon's friend Linda Ronstadt. Simon defended Ronstadt, saying: \\"I know that her intention was never to support the government there ... She made a mistake. She's extremely liberal in her political thinking and unquestionably antiapartheid.\\" When Van Zandt was finished writing \\"Sun City\\", he, Baker and Schechter spent the next several months searching for artists to participate in recording it. Van Zandt initially declined to invite Bruce Springsteen, not wanting to take advantage of their friendship, but Schechter had no problem asking himself; Springsteen accepted the invitation. Van Zandt also had reservations about inviting jazz giant Miles Davis, whom Schechter also contacted; with minimal persuasion, Davis also accepted. Eventually, Van Zandt, Baker and Schechter gathered a wide array of artists, including DJ Kool Herc, Grandmaster Melle Mel, The Fat Boys, Rub√©n Blades, Bob Dylan, Herbie Hancock, Ringo Starr and his son Zak Starkey, Lou Reed, Run DMC, Peter Gabriel, David Ruffin, Eddie Kendricks, Darlene Love, Bobby Womack, Afrika Bambaataa, Kurtis Blow, Jackson Browne and Daryl Hannah (his girlfriend at the time), Bono, George Clinton, Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood, Peter Wolf, Bonnie Raitt, Hall & Oates, Jimmy Cliff, Big Youth, Michael Monroe, Peter Garrett, Ron Carter, Ray Barretto, Gil Scott-Heron, Kashif, Nona Hendryx, Pete Townshend, Pat Benatar, Clarence Clemons, Stiv Bators and Joey Ramone. 303 tracks were mixed down to create \\"Sun City\\".  Composition  The song combines elements of hip-hop (which was beginning to achieve mainstream popularity at the time), R&B;, and hard rock. The main hook is multiple successive artists singing \\"I, I, I, I, I, I\\", followed by all the artists together singing \\"ain't gonna play Sun City!\\" A music video directed by Jonathan Demme with Godley and Creme was also produced. Reception Billboard magazine's review of the single stated that it \\"showcases an overwhelming array of all-star voices, keeps up a blistering urban/dance tempo, and pulls no punches on the message.\\" \\"Sun City\\" reached on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in December 1985. Only about half of American radio stations played \\"Sun City\\". Some stations objecting to the lyrics' explicit criticism of US President Ronald Reagan's policy of \\"constructive engagement\\", particularly George Clinton's and Joey Ramone's lines in the song \\"Our government tells us / We're doing all we can / Constructive engagement is / Ronald Reagan's plan.\\" (Ramone also expressed open discontent and criticism towards him with the Ramones song \\"Bonzo Goes to Bitburg\\".) \\"Sun City\\" was banned in Apartheid South Africa itself. The song did somewhat better overseas, reaching on the UK Singles Chart and peaking at in both Australia and New Zealand. It achieved chart action in a number of European countries, becoming a Top 5 hit in Sweden, Belgium and The Netherlands. It was also a top ten single in Canada in December 1985 and January 1986. \\"Sun City\\" was selected as Record of the Year by some of the most influential music critics, because it topped the prestigious international Pazz & Jop Critics Poll for best single of the year. Documentary Van Zandt and Schechter also struggled to get their documentary seen. Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) refused to broadcast the non-profit film The Making of Sun City even though it won the International Documentary Association's top honors in 1986. PBS claimed the featured artists were also involved in making the film and were therefore \\"self-promoting.\\" In 1987, WNYC-TV, the New York City-owned public television station, aired an updated version of the documentary, produced by filmmaker Bill Lichtenstein along with Schechter. The film included updates about the Sun City resort and apartheid as well as the success of the Sun City video. In addition to airing the documentary, WNYC-TV made the film available over the PBS system to public television stations across the country for broadcast. Impact The album and single raised more than US$1 million for anti-apartheid projects, but it paled in comparison to the popular and financial success of \\"We Are the World\\". It premiered at the United Nations, thanks to the Special Committee Against Apartheid and UN officers such as Aracelly Santana. Oliver Tambo and the ANC's school in Tanzania \\"was sure happy when we gave them a big check\\", according to Schechter. In South Africa, \\"Sun City\\" inspired musician Johnny Clegg to create a local organization similar to Van Zandt's. \\"Sun City\\" also became the catalyst for the South Africa Now TV series.

Brush Electrical Machines is a manufacturer of electrical generators typically for gas turbine and steam turbine driven applications. The main office is based at Loughborough in Leicestershire, UK. History Charles Francis Brush, born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1849, founded the Brush Electric Light Company, which stayed in business in the U.S. until 1889 when it was absorbed into the Thomson-Houston Company making Brush a wealthy man. In 1880, the Anglo-American Brush Electric Light Corporation was established in Lambeth, London. Its formation was to exploit the invention of Brush's first electric dynamo in 1876. As the business grew, due to the demand for new electrical apparatus, larger premises were sought, and in 1889 the corporation moved 100 miles north into the newly acquired Falcon Engine and Car Works at Loughborough under the new name, Brush Electrical Engineering Company Limited. In 1914, the company began manufacturing Ljungstrom steam turbines under licence. Over the next sixty years, the business grew by acquisitions, until in 1957, the Brush companies were incorporated into the Hawker Siddeley Group. Within the group, the company manufactured a vast range of electrical products, including turbo generators, salient pole machines, induction motors, traction motors and generators, traction locomotives, switchgear, transformers and fuses. In November 1991 Hawker Siddeley Electric Power Group was subject to a hostile takeover bid of ¬£1.5 billion from BTR plc, the large engineering conglomerate. The bid was successful so the Brush companies then became part of the BTR organisation. In November 1996 the FKI Group of Companies acquired the Hawker Siddeley Electric Power Group from BTR for a price of ¬£182 million. On 1 July 2008, Melrose plc completed the acquisition with FKI, Melrose being a specialist investor in the manufacturing industry, is now registered on the London Stock Exchange. During the last 125 years, various Brush companies (Brush Switchgear, Brush Transformers, Brush Traction and Brush Control Gear) have existed on the Falcon Works site, but throughout this period Brush Electrical Machines Ltd manufacturing generators and motors has always been the largest company. Over 5,000 staff were employed on the site during the 1960s and 70s. The following products are manufactured by Brush: * Air-cooled turbo generators in the range of 20 to 300MVA * Turbomotors from 10 to 100MW * Associated control equipment In 2018, all production moved to the Czech Republic causing the closure of the Loughborough plant. Aircraft manufacture In 1915, Brush Electrical was one of a number of companies outside the established aviation contractors selected by the Royal Navy to receive orders for aircraft to meet the expanding needs of the Royal Naval Air Service. Brush completed 650 aircraft by the end of 1919, including 400 Avro 504s and 142 Short Type 184s. It also built de Havilland Dragon Rapides during the Second World War, taking over production from de Havilland in 1943 and building 346 aircraft (47.5% of the total number produced) by the time production ended in 1945.Robertson 1970, pp. 396‚Äì398.Jackson 1987, p. 366.

It is the second novel in The Dresden Files, which follows the character of Harry Dresden, present-day Chicago's only professional wizard. Plot summary After the events in Storm Front, Kim Delaney, whom Dresden helped to control her magical talents, asks Dresden how to create a set of three magical circles, which could be used to contain powerful entities. Dresden withholds the information, because such circles are generally used to contain demigods and archangels. Lt. Karrin Murphy asks Dresden to consult on a homicide: a henchman of mobster Johnny Marcone was found, savaged, near a group of wolfish paw prints. Without telling Murphy, Dresden magically follows the scent of the murderer's blood that leads him to a confrontation with a gang of teenage werewolves and their pack leader, Tera West. After consultation with his oracular skull, Bob, Dresden informs Murphy of the existence of four different types of lupine theriomorphs: classic werewolves, hexenwolves, loup-garous and lycanthropes. At the police station, Dresden gets a tip from FBI Agent Harris that the Streetwolves biker gang might know something about the murder, and learns that the Streetwolves and their \\"pack leader,\\" Parker, are lycanthropes. Dresden escapes unscathed, but now the Streetwolves want him dead. Marcone offers to hire Dresden for protection, but Dresden refuses. On his way out the door, Marcone says that these killings are connected to a millionaire named Harley MacFinn and his Northwest Passage Project. Dresden summons the demon Chaunzaggoroth in order to get information, exchanging one more part of his name for information about Harley MacFinn. Before Dresden can check on Harley MacFinn, Lt. Murphy arrests him on suspicion of murder: Kim Delaney's shredded body was found in MacFinn's apartment next to a summoning circle. Tera West frees Dresden, telling him that MacFinn, her fianc√©, is a loup-garou, the most dangerous of the four \\"breeds\\" of werewolves. Dresden must draw a containment circle around MacFinn before the next full moon, or more innocent people will die. Dresden is shot during his escape from police custody, and is rescued by Tera. Desperate, he calls his sometime-girlfriend Susan, a reporter, and bums a ride in exchange for an exclusive on the wolf murders. Ignoring Dresden's warnings, Murphy arrests and jails MacFinn in his human form. Dresden races to the station to get to MacFinn, but the moon rises, and MacFinn changes, slaughtering the suspects in the holding cells, the desk sergeant, and Murphy's staff. Dresden drives off MacFinn and goes in search of Marcone. While searching for MacFinn, Dresden is attacked by the Streetwolves. They are interrupted by the FBI agents, and Dresden captures one, learning that the agents are hexenwolves, planning on killing Marcone (who is considered immune from any conventional form of justice) and have been working with the Streetwolves, planning on using MacFinn to kill Marcone. At moonrise, Dresden, Susan, Tera and her pack drive to Marcone's estate to save him from MacFinn. Dresden and his allies are captured by the FBI hexenwolves and are thrown into a pit Marcone had prepared to capture the transformed MacFinn, but Marcone frees them. Dresden and Murphy kill the FBI hexenwolves and MacFinn, and burn the hexenwolves' talismans so they can never be used again. Susan evacuates the Alphas, and the Chicago police arrest Marcone on general principle, though Dresden predicts that no charges will be filed. Tera, revealed to be a wolf that can change into a human, accepts that MacFinn had to be killed before he could cause more deaths, and returns to her family in the Northwest.

Sukuh ( ) is a 15th-century Javanese-Hindu temple (candi) that is located on the western slope of Mount Lawu (elevation ) on the border between Central and East Java provinces. Sukuh temple has a distinctive thematic reliefs from other candi where life before birth and sexual education are its main theme. Its main monument is a simple pyramid structure with reliefs and statues in front of it, including three tortoises with flattened shells and a male figure grasping his penis. A giant 1.82 m (6 ft) high of Shishna with four testes, representing penile incisions, was one of the statues that has been relocated to the National Museum of Indonesia. It is counted among the 5 known terraced megalithic pyramids in Indonesia, all of which are Hindu sites built during Hindu-Buddhist era, other being Candi Kethek, Gunung Padang Megalithic Site, Lebak Cibedug Temple, and Pugung Raharjo.Flame Rozario, Pyramids in Indonesia? It's not just Gunung Padang 30 May 2016. Background Sukuh is one of several temples built on the northwest slopes of Mount Lawu in the 15th century. By this time, Javanese religion and art had diverged from Indian precepts that had been so influential on temples styles during the 8th‚Äì10th centuries. This was the last significant area of temple building in Java before the island's courts were converted to Islam in the 16th century. It is difficult for historians to interpret the significance of these antiquities due to the temple's distinctiveness and the lack of records of Javanese ceremonies and beliefs of the era. The founder of Candi Sukuh thought that the slope of Mount Lawu was a sacred place for worshiping the ancestors and nature spirits and for observance of the fertility cults. The monument was built around 1437, as written as a chronogram date on the western gate, meaning that the area was under the rule of the Majapahit Kingdom during its end (1293‚Äì1500). Some archaeologists believe the founder had cast the fall of Majapahit, based on the reliefs that displaying the feud between two aristocratic houses, symbolizing two internal conflicts in the kingdom. In 1815, Sir Thomas Raffles, the ruler of Java during 1811-1816, visited the temple and found it in bad condition. In his account, many statues had been thrown down on the ground and most of the figures had been decapitated. Raffles also found the giant lingga statue broken into two pieces, which was then glued together. This vandalism of traditional culture (especially where sexuality is not suppressed, as in the statues) is likely to be an effect of the Islamic invasion of Java during the 16th century, based upon the identical patterns found in all other Islamic and monotheistic invasions generally. Architecture A relief of yoni-lingga on the floor of the Candi Sukuh's entrance The central pyramid of the complex sits at the rear of the highest of three terraces. Originally, worshippers would have accessed the complex through a gateway at the western or lowest terrace. To the left of the gate is a carving of a monster eating a man, birds in a tree, and a dog, which is thought to be a chronogram representing 1437 CE, the likely date of the temple's consecration. There is an obvious depiction of sexual intercourse in a relief on the floor at the entrance where it shows a paired lingam which is represented physiologically by the (phallus) and yoni, which is represented bodily by the (vagina). Genitalia are portrayed on several statues from the site, which is unique among Javanese classical monuments. The main structure of Sukuh temple is like no other ancient edifice; it is a truncated pyramid reminiscent of a Maya monument and surrounded by monoliths and meticulously carved life-sized figures. The Sukuh temple does not follow the Hindu architecture Wastu Vidya because it was built after the Hindu religion had weakened. Temples usually have a rectangular or square shape, but Sukuh temple is a trapezium with three terraces, with one terrace higher than the others. A stone stairway rises through the front side of the pyramid to its summit. It is not known what the monument's unique shape was intended to symbolize. One suggestion is that it represents a mountain. There is no evidence that the main building supported a wooden structure. The only object recovered from its summit was a 1.82-metre lingga statue bearing an inscription and it is now in the National Museum of Indonesia). The statue may once have stood on the platform over the stairway. The lingga statue has a dedicated inscription carved from top to bottom representing a vein followed by a chronogram date equivalent to 1440. The inscription translates \\"Consecration of the Holy Ganges sudhi in ... the sign of masculinity is the essence of the world.\\" Reliefs of a kris blade, an eight-pointed sun and a crescent moon decorate the statue. A headless life-sized male figure grasping penis. The wall of the main monument has a relief portraying two men forging a weapon in a smithy with a dancing figure of Ganesha, the most important Tantric deity, having a human body and the head of an elephant. In Hindu-Java mythology, the smith is thought to possess not only the skill to alter metals, but also the key to spiritual transcendence. Smiths drew their powers to forge a kris from the god of fire; and a smithy is considered as a shrine. Hindu-Javanese kingship was sometimes legitimated and empowered by the possession of a kris. The scene in bas relief The scene depicted Bhima as the blacksmith in the left forging the metal, Ganesha in the center, and Arjuna in the right operating the tube blower to pump air into the furnace. The elephant head figure with a crown in the smithy relief depicts Ganesha, the god who removes obstacles in Hinduism. The Ganesha figure, however, differs in some small respects with other usual depictions. Instead of sitting, the Ganesha figure in Candi Sukuh's relief is shown dancing and it has distinctive features including the exposed genitalia, the demonic physiognomy, the strangely awkward dancing posture, the rosary bones on its neck and holding a small animal, probably a dog. The Ganesha relief in Candi Sukuh has a similarity with the Tantric ritual found in the history of Buddhism in Tibet written by Taranatha. The Tantric ritual is associated with several figures, one of whom is described as the \\"King of Dogs\\" (Sanskrit: Kukuraja), who taught his disciples by day, and by night performed Ganacakra in a burial ground or charnel ground. Other statues in Candi Sukuh include a life-sized male figure with his hand grasping his own penis and three flattened shells of tortoises. Two large tortoise statues guard the pyramid entrance and the third one lies at some distance in front of the monument. All of their heads point to the west and their flattened shells may provide altars for purification rituals and ancestor worship. In Hindu mythology, the tortoise symbolizes the base or support of the World and is an avatar of Vishnu, i.e. Kurma refer: Ocean of Milk.

Each minigame explains its controls before play commences. Some titles of the series, however, make use of a steering wheel (Handle Champ), two joysticks (Gachaga Champ), a dance pad (Step Champ), or a spinning button (BishiBashi Channel) for the controls instead of the 3 buttons. The‚òÖBishiBashi uses the yellow button (start button) in most mini-games to finish the mini-game before time runs out or to score additional points. BishiBashi Channel replaces the green button with a larger one that can be rotated, and some mini-games require players to rotate this button.  PlayStation games  Some of the minigames from the arcade games have been ported to the Sony PlayStation and released under the name Bishi Bashi Special („Éì„Ç∑„Éê„Ç∑„Çπ„Éö„Ç∑„É£„É´).

It is the only high school in the Rossford Exempted Village School District. The district mainly serves the city of Rossford and also includes parts of the city of Northwood, Perrysburg Township, and Lake Township within Wood County. History The current high school was built in 1922 with its first class graduating in 1924. The George G. Wolfe Field House opened in 1950 to be used for indoor athletic events. In 1957 and 1958 respectively, Rossford absorbed the students that attended the Glenwood Elementary and Lime City Elementary school districts as a means of eliminating such jurisdictions across Ohio. The final addition to the high school was built in 1981. Starting with the 2018‚Äì19 school year, Rossford students will temporarily be housed at Owens Community College while the high school and middle school complex is upgraded, which is expected to be finished by early 2020. The refurbished building will include technological improvements, areas for grades 6‚Äì8 and 9‚Äì12, and new gymnasiums for both high school and middle school use. It will also retain the original structure from 1922.

Rossford was one of the founding members of the Northern Lakes League in 1956, but joined the Northern Buckeye Conference in 2011. At the high school campus, basketball, volleyball, football, and the occasional soccer game are played. Baseball, softball, track & field, and soccer are played at the Glenwood Elementary complex almost south of the main campus. Rossford's greatest athletic run to date came during the 1960s and 1970s when the Bulldogs secured numerous NLL titles in football, boys basketball, and baseball. Three trips were made to the final four for basketball, which included runner-up finishes in 1966 and 1970.http://www.ohsaa.org/sports/history/BBK/tourn_participation.htm#R The Rossford football team has made nine appearances in the state playoffs, earning their first win with a come-from-behind victory in the first round of the 2015 Division V playoffs over Norwayne High School.

Wembdon is now home to an Anglican church, a small shop (combined with the post office), a pub and a small garage. History Wembdon was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as having \\"5 villagers and 6 smallholders with four ploughs\\". The name Wembdon is believed to mean \\"Huntsman's Hill\\", referring to Wembdon Hill itself where Saxon* burials have been discovered. These are believed to be British burials which date to the Saxon period. Wembdon Hill is also the site of St. Johns Well, which was renowned for its healing powers from the 15th century onwards. In 2002 a northern distributor road for Bridgwater was built to the south of the village to ease traffic congestion in Bridgwater town centre. The road had been part of local town planning since the 1980s, and building proceeded despite some local resistance. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Sedgemoor, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Bridgwater Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Bridgwater and West Somerset county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. Religious sites St George's Church was granted by William Testard, lord of Wembdon Manor, to St John's Hospital, Bridgwater in 1284. The church was badly damaged by fire in March 1868, and as the certificate for fire insurance had expired, had to be rebuilt with significant local aid. Education A Church of England VC Primary school (Wembdon St. Georges) can be found in the village. Culture Wembdon Village Day occurs towards the end of August every year, centred on competitions involving arts and crafts, fruit and vegetables, baking, jam making and wine making and many other events. It takes place on the playing field and nearby Parish centre building. A large car boot sale is also in place on the day and local radio station Quay West 107.4 conduct a live show from a stage during the event. On the Saturday closest to 5 November, Guy Fawkes Night, a bonfire is set up on the playing field, and a fireworks display is shown during the evening. St George's Parish Centre opposite the church is the venue for many village activities. These include Scouts and Guides, a nursery school and the meetings of the Wembdon Community Association.http://www.sgw.org.uk/parishcentre St George's Parish Centre Further reading *Victoria County History, Vol.6, 1992, Wembdon: Manors and other estates, pp. 325-330 References Villages in Sedgemoor Somerset Levels Civil parishes in Somerset ","title":"Wembdon"},{"id":"9648156","text":"I Want One of Those (also referred to as IWOOT) is an online retailer offering a selection of homeware, gadgets, gizmos, toys and office accessories as well as organised adventures.

The village population is included in the civil parish of Stody (This cannot be true as Stody is in North Norfolk!). Its church, St Mary, is one of 124 existing round-tower churches in Norfolk. The best-known former incumbent of Hassingham is the Rev. William Haslam, a nineteenth- Century evangelical, better known as the Vicar who was converted by his own sermon. Haslam held the living, together with that of nearby Buckenham from 1863 to 1871, having been presented to the living by Sir Thomas Beauchamp of Langley Hall. During Haslam's ministry in Hassingham, it was said that most of the population of this small village professed evangelical conversion. (Currently out of print) Haslam was supported by his wife and the preacher Catherine Hooper who they had met in Bath. Rail access The nearest station is Buckenham railway station on the Wherry Line.

They share a common passion for the enrichment of arts and culture. Programmes The grant programmes of IFA respond to demand for assistance, while also giving encouragement to new perspectives and directions in the arts. IFA has made over 450 grants across states. The Arts Research programme supports scholars, researchers, and practitioners to undertake research into the histories and expressions of artistic practices in India. It seeks to foster wider perspectives, understandings, interpretations and engagements in the arts. The Arts Education programme places the school teacher at the centre of its work and supports artists through grants, towards arts-based education in Government Schools in Karnataka. It maintains a continuous dialogue with the National Council of Research Education and Training (NCERT), the Directorate of Public Instruction, Karnataka, the Department of State Education, Research and Training (DSERT), Karnataka, and Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, to intensify its capacity building programme. The Arts Practice programme supports critical practice in the arts. It encourages practitioners working across artistic disciplines to question existing notions through their practice. The programme seeks to establish a culture where arts practice is constantly being shaped and articulated through experimentation, critique and dialogue. The Archival and Museum Fellowships support practitioners and researchers to activate the collections in archives and museums through curatorial and artistic interventions.The Fellowships enable collections to come alive and be made accessible to a large public, with the hope that this engagement will allow museums and archives, to function less as repositories and more as sites that influence discourse, and creativity in the arts.

The town villains confuse him with a lawman named Jim Rawlings whom they had murdered a few years prior, because the two men look very similar. Hefty the bartender and Sheriff Collins used to be friends with Rawlings and come up with a plan to fool the local crooks into thinking Grant really is the man they killed. Even Helen, the dead lawman's widow, thinks her husband's returned from the grave when she first sees him. Grant sees how the woman's ranch hands are mismanaging the ranch her husband left her and are even stealing from her, and decides to help her get the place back to financial solvency.

Biography  Jean Marie Basset is an engineer from the √âcole Sup√©rieure de Chimie Industrielle de Lyon. He is doing a doctoral thesis under the supervision of Professor Marcel Prettre, a corresponding member of the Institute. After a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Toronto in Toronto and Imperial College in London (with Nobel Prize winner Prof. Wilkinson), he joined the CNRS Catalytic Institute, where he became Deputy Director. He was then a founding member, along with Jean Claude Charpentier, of the √âcole de Chimie Physique et √âlectronique de Lyon (CPE Lyon), where he became scientific director. He created the Surface Organometallic Chemistry Laboratory and then the Catalysis and Process Chemistry Laboratory COMS UMR CNRS-CPE-UCB 52, of which he is the director. He then became a founding member and director of the Catalysis Centre at King Abdullah University of Science and technology in 2008. He was President of a European Laboratory of Excellence (NOE) IDECAT, which includes 44 catalyst laboratories in Europe. He has been a member of the board of numerous institutions such as AXELERA (competition pole, chemistry and environment), CPE, the Maison de la Chimie. Research Jean Marie Basset's only scientific objective was to bring together two a priori very different disciplines; homogeneous catalysis on the one hand (governed by the laws of molecular chemistry) and heterogeneous catalysis on the other hand (more oriented towards surface science). Yet catalysis (whether heterogeneous or homogeneous) is a discipline corresponding to the transformation of molecules into other molecules and macromolecules. Therefore, the rules of molecular chemistry should apply to the rationalization, at least partial, of heterogeneous catalysis phenomena. In particular, any heterogeneous catalyst intermediate must involve an organometallic surface fragment.

He studied law at the University of Budapest and was Assistant Hungarian Postmaster General. His sister M√°ria was the mother of the cultural historian Bela Borsody Bevilaqua, Ph.D. Gyula's grandfather was Daniel Szentessy one of the globetrotters that Bela Borsody wrote about in his book entitled Regi Magyar Vilagjrok or Hungarian Old World Travellers. D√°niel Szentessy (1805, Zempl√©nszentes ‚Äì 1895, Nagyv√°rad) was a sword-forging master. His family ruled the city of Szentes from which his surname is derived szentesi. After the early death of his parents, he was adopted by a Nagyv√°rad merchant. He completed the V√°rad Latin school, and studied sword-forging. As a journeyman, he started his wanderings in 1825. The main stations of his fifteen years of travels were the world-famous places of contemporary armoury: Vienna, Innsbruck, Alsace-Lorraine, Flandreau, Sheffield, Bayonne, Cordoba, Toledo, Algiers, Tunis, Damascus, and Istanbul. He returned home to open a workshop in Nagyv√°rad in 1840. He took part in the 1848 Revolution. He was court-martialed and sentenced to two years‚Äô imprisonment in Munk√°cs Castle. Released in 1851, he lived in Nagyv√°rad until his death. Gyula Szentessy's mother was the widow of the mayor of Cluj. She had to become a seamstress and was exposed to the dreary life of prolet√°rian suffering. Gyula felt the beauty of human life, especially in the working lives of women. His poetry promoted socialist reforms for women. His poetry focused on the recognition that love is the only happiness of the human soul. Love makes it possible to achieve the most beautiful dreams. Literary historians consider Gyula Szentessy to be a poet describing social classes of the circles of proletarian and poor petty bourgeois women. Although the theme of a lot of his poems can be related to urban scenes, the linguistic and poetic aspect of his ways of presentation does not seem so stratificated. A typical feature of his poetry is making contrasts between scenes like country and town, or effects like darkness and light, silence and noise, which often carries metaphorical or allegorical meaning. One of his most famous poems was written about his mother.

The king has no political power, but is sought as a counsel or sponsor by Nigerian politicians who seek support from the various residents of Lagos. Among other ceremonial roles, the Oba as well as indulging in tourism advertisements on behalf of the city, often stating, \\"you've gotta go to Lagos‚Äù. History All Obas of Lagos trace their lineage to Ashipa, a war captain of the Oba of Benin. Ashipa was rewarded with title of Oloriogun (or War leader) and received the Oba of Benin's sanction to govern Lagos. Some Benin accounts of history have the Ashipa as son or grandson of the Oba of Benin. Other accounts note that Ashipa is a Yoruba corruption of the Benin name Aisika-hienbore (translated \\"we shall not desert this place\\"). Ashipa received a sword and royal drum as symbols of his authority from the Oba of Benin on his mission to Lagos. Additionally, the Oba of Benin deployed a group of Benin officers charged with preserving Benin's interests in Lagos. These officers, led by Eletu Odibo, were the initial members of the Akarigbere class of Lagos White Cap Chiefs. Prior to the arrival of the British, the Oba of Benin had \\"the undisputed right to crown or confirm the individual whom the people of Lagos elect[ed] to be their King\\". The defeat of Oba Kosoko by British forces on December 28, 1851, in what is now known as the Bombardment of Lagos or Reduction of Lagos, or locally as Ogun Ahoyaya or Ogun Agidingbi (after boiling cannons), put an end to Lagos' s former allegiance to the Oba of Benin. Kosoko was therefore the last Oba of Lagos to remit annual tributes from the people of Lagos to the Oba of Benin. Oba Akitoye, who was re- installed to the throne by the British, \\"seized the opportunity of his restoration under British protection to repudiate his former allegiance\\" to Benin and rebuffed subsequent tribute requests from the Oba of Benin. Previous rulers of Lagos have used the titles of Ologun (derived from Oloriogun), Eleko and, most recently, Oba of Lagos. The current Oba of Lagos, His Highness Oba Rilwan Akiolu, has served in the position since May 2003. The Royal Seat The official residence of the king, since 1630, is Iga Idunganran, a castle constructed by the Portuguese over the course of close to a century.

Reverse T3 is the third-most common iodothyronine the thyroid gland releases into the bloodstream, at 0.9%; tetraiodothyronine (levothyroxine, T4) constitutes 90% and T3 is 9%. However, 95% of rT3 in human blood is made elsewhere in the body, as enzymes remove a particular iodine atom from T4. The production of hormone by the thyroid gland is controlled by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. The physiological activity of thyroid hormone is regulated by a system of enzymes that activate, inactivate or simply discard the prohormone T4 and in turn functionally modify T3 and rT3. These enzymes operate under complex direction of systems including neurotransmitters, hormones, markers of metabolism and immunological signals. The levels of rT3 increase in conditions such as euthyroid sick syndrome because its clearance decreases while its production stays the same. The decreased clearance is possibly from lower Thyroxine 5-deiodinase activity in the peripheral tissue or decreased liver uptake of rT3. In addition, increased rT3 concentrations result from upregulated Thyroxine 5-deiodinase activity in critical illness, starvation and fetal life. Reactions T3 and T2 is also shown.

History  The division was formed in the reorganization and expansion of the Hellenic Army following the Balkan Wars of 1912‚Äì13. It was activated on 23 December (O.S.) 1913 at Kozani, comprising the 31st, 32nd, 33rd Infantry Regiments and the XII Mountain Artillery Battalion. It formed part of III Army Corps. The original formation was disbanded during the National Schism and did not take part in any engagements during World War I. In February 1920, the Xanthi Division (ŒúŒµœÅŒ±œÅœáŒØŒ± ŒûŒ¨ŒΩŒ∏Œ∑œÇ) was formed at Thessaloniki from Thracian recruits, whence its naming after the city of Xanthi. Commanded by Major General Konstantinos Mazarakis-Ainian, it comprised the 13th, 14th, 15th Infantry Regiments, the XII Mountain Artillery Regiment and other divisional units. In May 1920, the division took part in the Greek takeover of Western Thrace, after which it was shipped to Anatolia where it took part in the Greek offensive operations against the Turkish nationalist forces. In July it was withdrawn from the Anatolian front and re-shipped to take part in the operations for the capture of Eastern Thrace. Following the 1920 elections and the victory of the anti- Venizelist royalist coalition, the Xanthi Division was renamed as the 12th Infantry Division. In early 1921, it was reformed under the command of Prince Andrew and, comprising the 14th, 41st and 46th Regiments, was transferred once again to the Anatolian front, landing in Smyrna between 29 May and 6 June 1921. The division took part in the Battle of K√ºtahya‚ÄìEski≈üehir and the Greek advance to Ankara, which ended in the Battle of Sakarya. The division was commanded from 15 July by Colonel Periklis Kallidopoulos. The division remained in Anatolia under I Army Corps until the great Turkish offensive in August 1922. The division was practically destroyed as a fighting force after the Battle of Dumlupƒ±nar; its remnants‚Äî155 officers, 2,240 men, 1,010 animals, 18 guns and 15 machine-guns‚Äîembarked at √áesme for Chios on 31 August. In Greece, its remnants were merged with the Independent Division to form the new 12th Division at Feres as part of the Army of the Evros (October 1922). It remained in Western Thrace after the signature of the Treaty of Lausanne, based at Komotini. Upon the outbreak of the Greco-Italian War in October 1940, the division remained in Thrace, and provided the cadre for several reserve regiments, which were transferred to other divisions. On 6 March 1941, with the expected German invasion of Greece looming, the division was transferred to the Central Macedonia Army Section, and was placed under the British Commonwealth troops holding the Vermion‚ÄìAliakmon line. Coming under German attack at the Battle of Siatista Pass, the division retreated to the southwest and lost much of its force to desertion; finally, with the Greek capitulation on 24 April, the division, by now reduced to some 1,000 men, was disbanded. 12th Infantry Division was reformed on 26 August 1964 at Alexandroupoli, with the 29th, 30th and 31st Regiments and other divisional units. In June 1996 it was converted into a mechanized infantry division, and in 2009 it received the honorific title \\"Evros\\".

History=World War I The 16th Infantry Division was formed for the first time in late 1915 or early 1916, following the Greek mobilization on 10 September 1915, in response to the mobilization of Bulgaria. It comprised the 46th, 47th, and 48th Infantry Regiments, and was part of the V Army Corps. In June 1916, it was transferred to Northern Epirus, with headquarters at Argyrokastron and the regiments based at Korytsa, Argyrokastron, and Premeti respectively. The division was withdrawn south following the Italian occupation of the area in autumn 1916. In April 1917, along with the rest of the Hellenic Army still loyal to the royal government in Athens, it was withdrawn to the Peloponnese at the insistence of the Entente powers. Its final base was at Pyrgos, Elis, where it was disbanded shortly after. World War II At the commencement of the Greco-Italian War in October 1940, it was reactivated in Lamia as a brigade but was quickly expanded to a division-strength by the end of the year and placed under the command of the Western Macedonia Army Section (III Army Corps). The 16th Division took part in operations against Italian forces throughout the campaign, capturing Hill 601 near Tseritsa on 10 February 1941, holding the line against repeated Italian attacks in the Tomoritsa Sector, and capturing Teke Hill on 31 March 1941 by bayonet charge. The division was disbanded in Agrinio, for a second time, in May 1941, after the German invasion of Greece. Post-war period In 1965, the 99th Military Command () was formed in the town of Didymoteicho. It was expanded and renamed in 1975 to the 16th Infantry Division (). The division was reorganized in 2009 as a mechanized infantry division and given the title of \\"Didymoteicho\\" to honor its long association with the garrison town. Emblem and motto The emblem of the 16th Mechanized Infantry Division is the double-headed eagle of the Byzantine Empire, standing guard on the walls of Constantinople. The division's motto is \\"We Shall All Die Willingly\\" (). The phrase is attributed to Constantine XI Palaiologos, the last reigning Byzantine Emperor. According to the historian Doukas, before the beginning of the siege of Constantinople in 1453, the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II made an offer to Constantine XI. In exchange for the surrender of Constantinople, the emperor's life would be spared and he would continue to rule in Mistra. Constantine answered, \\"To surrender the city to you is neither my right, nor any of its inhabitants, because it is our decision that, in its defence, we shall all die willingly and we shall not lament our death\\" ().

XX Œ§ŒòŒú) is the only armoured division of the Hellenic Army. It is headquartered in Kavala, Macedonia. History The Hellenic Army's first attempt to form an armoured/mechanized division was the 19th Mechanized Division in early 1941, which was destroyed during the German invasion of Greece. These efforts were resumed after Liberation, with mechanized units being established in 1945 and fighting in the Greek Civil War of 1946‚Äì49. The same period saw also the arrival of the first true tanks in Greece, the British Centaur tanks, which only began to be employed in 1947. From 1950 on, the Hellenic Army began receiving M24 Chaffee tanks and M18 Hellcat tank destroyers. In 1954, 9th Infantry Division was converted into an armoured division, comprising two Battle Commands (ŒîŒπŒøŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÉŒµŒπœÇ ŒúŒ¨œáŒ∑œÇ, ŒîŒúŒë). Due to the severe lack of tanks and other armoured vehicles, the division was armoured in name only. In 1956 the 9th Armoured Division was converted into the 20th Armoured Division, which was gradually formed over the next four years. With the arrival of the first M47 Patton tanks in 1957, the first Medium Tank Battalions (ŒïœÄŒπŒªŒ±œÅœáŒØŒµœÇ ŒúŒ≠œÉœâŒΩ ŒëœÅŒºŒ¨œÑœâŒΩ, ŒïŒúŒë) of 55 tanks each, were formed. From 1964, the division began receiving the first M48 Patton tanks and M113 armoured personnel carriers, which began replacing older material. By 1971, sufficient numbers of M48 tanks had arrived so that three new Medium Tank Battalions, 24th, 25th, and 26th, could be established so that each Battle Command comprised two Medium Tank Battalions. In 1977‚Äì79, the Battle Commands were formed into independent Armoured Brigades, with 3rd Battle Command forming the 23rd Armoured Brigade, 1st Battle Command forming the 24th Armoured Brigade, and 2nd Battle Command forming the 25th Armoured Brigade. 20th Division remained as an operational headquarters coordinating the latter two brigades. In 1985, 25th Armoured Brigade passed directly under IV Army Corps, and was replaced by 22nd Armoured Brigade.

The two existing divisions were then abolished on 1 August 1900 as part of a general restructuring, and three new divisions were ordered established a month later. 2nd Division, still at Athens, now comprised 3rd Brigade (Athens) with the 1st and 7th Regiments, and 4th Brigade (Chalkis) with the 2nd and 5th Infantry Regiments, as well as the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, the 2nd Artillery Regiment, and the 2nd Evzone Battalion. On 9 September 1904, as part of another reorganization, the 4th Brigade was moved to Nafplio and now comprised the 8th and 11th Regiments, while the 3rd Brigade remained as it was. In addition, the division now comprised the 1st and 2nd Evzone Battalions, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Field Artillery Regiment, 2nd Engineers Battalion, 2nd Train Company and 2nd Nursing Company, and the 2nd Military Music Command. Most of these support units were based at Athens. In January 1912, the brigades were abolished and divisions organized as triangular divisions. The Division remained at Athens, but now comprised 1st and 7th Regiments at Athens and the 3rd Infantry Regiment at Chalkis, plus supporting units. In 1998, the division was directly subordinate to the II Army Corps. It comprised the 33rd and 34th Brigades, both mechanised.

History The business began back in November 1882 when two young Dutch entrepreneurs, Adriaan Pot and Willem Smit established a company called Elektrisch Licht-Machinen Fabriek Willem Smit & Co.. Later, the name changed to Smit Slikkerveer. In the early days, the company manufactured various electrical products including dynamos and lighting equipment. This was followed by direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) electric motors, generators, drives and transformers. In 1962, following a merger between Smit Slikkerveer and the dominant Heemaf Hengelo along with several other companies, the new name of Samenwerkende Elektrotechische Fabrieken Holec N.V. was created. During the 1980s, the company, which was simply known as Holec Machines and Apparaten (HOLEC), was suffering from failing business due to downturns and changes in old industries, such as the shipbuilding industry. The resulting economics required more restructuring to meet the uncertainty. In 1989, the Holec Machines and Appararten business along with associated sister companies were taken over by the Royal Begemann Group, which provided considerable capital investment for the new plants, and equipment required to keep the divisions viable and competitive in a global marketplace. It also allowed Holec to move further into traction electrical machines. In March 1998, the division of what had been the old Smit Slikkerveer was split into two smaller but focussed business units, HMA Power Systems and Traxis BV. Traxis BV focussed on traction control equipment whereas the larger HMA Power Systems concentrated on its core business of medium to large AC generators, DC traction motors, associated control equipment, and service and repair work. Early in 2000, HMA Power Systems was purchased outright by FKI plc which was in turn purchased by private equity company Melrose plc in 2008. It is now part of the larger group Brush Turbo Generators, the Brush HMA element of which currently employs approximately three hundred fifty staff across its range of manufacturing shops, design and development offices. Facilities The Brush HMA manufacturing plant is located adjacent to the river, north of Ridderkerk, near Rotterdam in the Netherlands. The Brush HMA plant at Ridderkerk, not to be confused with the other Holec Ridderkerk enterprise that became part of France's Alstom, has manufactured many different types of electrical machines and associated equipment over the last one hundred twenty years. Today its core business is centred on the manufacture of medium-sized four pole turbo-generators (Brush Turbogenerator Division centre of excellence), AC traction motors and service and repair of electrical machines. In the four pole turbogenerator range, the principal product is the DG range, which is sold globally to all major oil and gas companies.

It is revealed they have both been killed in the last few months and a criminal profiling team has come to the conclusion that the person responsible was someone exactly like Reacher. Reacher realizes that he has no alibi for the places and times that the women were killed, and he requests a lawyer. Reacher's lawyer girlfriend Jodie arrives, and he is released after further questioning. Jodie returns to work, and Reacher drives to his house in upstate New York that he inherited from Leon Garber. He is soon called upon by two members of the FBI team that previously questioned him. A third woman has been killed who was also an ex-soldier who filed for sexual harassment ‚Äì albeit in a different timeframe from the first two. The FBI compels him to assist with the investigation by threatening to hurt him and, possibly, Jodie too. Reacher and Special Agent Lamarr, the lead profiler on the team, drive from New York to the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, whilst discussing information on the case. Lamarr's stepsister, it so happens, is a woman with the same particulars as the three already killed. Lamarr also reveals the killer's M.O., which is killing the victims in an unknown way, with no bruises or injuries, leaving them naked in their bathtub, filled with army-issue camouflage paint. 150pxthumbleftRunning Blind (Lee Child novel) US cover The team holds several meetings at Quantico, and Reacher meets agent Lisa Harper, the woman who has to accompany Reacher wherever he goes. Reacher suggests contacting Colonel John Trent at Fort Dix to inquire about special forces soldiers and the three week rotation (another of Lamarr's misdirects of the investigation). Reacher and Harper head up to New Jersey, but while Harper remains outside the colonel's office due to security clearance reasons, the colonel helps Reacher sneak out the window and arranges a four-hour trip to New York. Once there Jack targets a random pair of criminals collecting protection money and deliberately instigates a turf war between rival racketeers. By taking a certain crime lord out of the picture this effectively removes the leverage that the FBI has had over him and Jodie. He returns to New Jersey with Agent Harper being none the wiser. The team continues the search, and the next victim is Agent Lamarr's stepsister. Local policemen are then put on surveillance of the remaining women on the list. Eventually Reacher and Harper catch the killer. It is none other than FBI Agent Lamarr. She is in the process of killing her fifth victim when Jack intervenes. Reacher and Harper come to the conclusion that Lamarr was utilising her hypnotising techniques to make the victims unwittingly suffocate themselves by swallowing their own tongues. Her motives were a family inheritance and a sociopathic bitterness to her stepsister; the other murders were carried out to muddy the investigative waters. The FBI is unhappy that Reacher has killed one of their agents, murderess or not, but an accord is eventually reached. Jack then meets up with Jodie, and she reveals she is leaving for London in a month's time. Reacher knows he will not want to go with her, since he misses his wandering ways, and the two agree to spend one last month together. Production The Visitor was released in the United Kingdom on 20 April 2000, and the American publication followed on 13 July of the same year. The reason for the story having two different titles is due to how The Visitor‚ÄîChild's original title and ultimately the UK title of the story‚Äîwas seen by Putnam as sounding too much like a science-fiction novel. Reception The Visitor was well received, with Publishers Weekly saying \\"the book harbors two elements that separate it from the pack: a brain-teasing puzzle that gets put together piece by fascinating piece, and a central character with Robin Hood-like integrity and an engagingly eccentric approach to life.\\" American book review journal Kirkus Reviews called it \\"deeply satisfying\\" and the reader should \\"plan to stay up long past bedtime and do some serious hyperventilating toward the end.\\" Booklist also offered a good review, saying \\"This fourth Reacher thriller is easily the best. The plot is a masterpiece.\\" The Visitor was nominated for the 2001 Barry Award for \\"Best Hardcover Novel\\", but ultimately fell short to Deep South by Nevada Barr.

AGUDLP (for \\"account, global, universal, domain local, permission\\") and AGLP (for \\"account, global, local, permission\\") summarize similar RBAC implementation schemes in Active Directory forests and in Windows NT domains, respectively.  Details  Role based access controls (RBAC) simplify routine account management operations and facilitate security audits. System administrators do not assign permissions directly to individual user accounts. Instead, individuals acquire access through their roles within an organization, which eliminates the need to edit a potentially large (and frequently changing) number of resource permissions and user rights assignments when creating, modifying, or deleting user accounts. Unlike traditional access control lists, permissions in RBAC describe meaningful operations within a particular application or system instead of the underlying low-level data object access methods. Storing roles and permissions in a centralized database or directory service simplifies the process of ascertaining and controlling role memberships and role permissions. Auditors can analyze permissions assignments from a single location without having to understand the resource-specific implementation details of a particular access control.  RBAC in a single AD domain  Microsoft's implementation of RBAC leverages the different security group scopes featured in Active Directory: ; Global security groups : Domain security groups with global scope represent business roles or job functions within the domain. These groups may contain accounts and other global groups from the same domain, and they can be used by resources in any domain in the forest. They can be changed frequently without causing global catalog replication. ; Domain local security groups : Domain security groups with domain local scope describe the low-level permissions or user rights to which they are assigned. These groups can only be used by systems in the same domain. Domain local groups may contain accounts, global groups, and universal groups from any domain, as well as domain local groups from the same domain. Global groups that represent business roles should contain only user or computer accounts. Likewise, domain local groups that describe resource permissions or user rights should contain only global groups that represent business roles. Accounts or business roles should never be granted permissions or rights directly, as this complicates subsequent rights analysis.  RBAC in AD forests  In multi-domain environments, the different domains within an AD forest may only be connected by WAN links or VPN connections, so special domain controllers called global catalog servers cache certain directory object classes and attribute types in order to reduce costly or slow inter- domain directory lookups. Objects cached by the global catalog servers include universal groups but not global groups, making membership look-ups of universal groups much faster than similar queries of global groups. However, any change to a universal group triggers (potentially expensive) global catalog replication, and changes to universal groups require forest-wide security rights inappropriate in most large enterprises. These two limitations prevent universal security groups from completely replacing global security groups as the sole representatives of an enterprise's business roles. Instead, RBAC implementations in these environments use universal security groups to represent roles across the enterprise while retaining domain-specific global security groups, as illustrated by the abbreviation AGUDLP.  RBAC in non-AD domains  Domains in Windows NT 4.0 and earlier only have global (domain- level) and local (non-domain) groups and do not support group nesting at the domain level. The abbreviation AGLP refers to these limitations as applied to RBAC implementations in older domains: _G_ lobal groups represent business roles, while _l_ ocal groups (created on the domain member servers themselves) represent permissions or user rights.  Example  Given a shared folder, \\\\\\\\ yc-ex-svr-01\\\\groups\\\\bizdev; a business development group within the organization's marketing department, represented in Active Directory as the (existing) global security group \\"Business Development Team Member\\"; and a requirement that the entire group have read/write access to the shared folder, an administrator following AGDLP might implement the access control as follows: # Create a new domain local security group in Active Directory named \\"Change permission on \\\\\\\\ yc-ex-svr-01\\\\groups\\\\bizdev\\". # Grant that domain local group the NTFS \\"change\\" permission set (read, write, execute/modify, delete) on the \\"bizdev\\" folder. (Note that NTFS permissions are different from share permissions.) # Make the global group \\"Business Development Team Member\\" a member of the domain local group \\"Change permission on \\\\\\\\ yc-ex- svr-01\\\\groups\\\\bizdev\\". To highlight the advantages of RBAC using this example, if the Business Development Team required additional permissions on the \\"bizdev\\" folder, a system administrator would only need to edit a single access control entry (ACE) instead of, in the worst case, editing as many ACEs as there are users with access to the folder.

Incident According to her mother Anthoniya Figerardo, Ida Carmelita at the age of sixteen (16) was coerced into joining the rebel LTTE group as a child soldier for three years. She eventually left the rebel group. She had surrendered to the Sri Lankan police about a month before her murder. On the night of July 12, 1999 five men broke into her mother's house, and, after tying up the occupants, proceeded to gang rape and kill her. The incident happened in the town of Pallimunai, in the Mannar district. In his report, the coroner in Mannar documented evidence of rape and sexual violence, including bites on her breasts and lips. She had been shot through her vagina. Following her death, Ida's two brothers and sisters eventually fled to a refugee camp in India. Her mother initially stayed behind, determined to bring her daughter's killers to justice. However, she also left when Kumar Ponnambalam, the lawyer handling the case, was killed in Colombo in January 2000. Her murder attracted widespread media attention in Sri Lanka and elsewhere. Government investigation Two of the suspects had been recognized by a neighbor and another by the brother of the victim before he fled to India. A corporal and a soldier of the Sri Lankan Army were identified at an identification parade by witnesses and taken into custody. However, after two key witnesses were threatened and subsequently fled to India, the case is no longer proceeding. The suspects have been released on bail. Various witnesses testified at hearings held during the year. During the year, investigations conducted into the case found that the weapons used in the killing belonged to army personnel. Forensic experts have confirmed that the bullets used in Ida‚Äôs murder correspond to those usually used by the army. Related to the incident Napoleon Figerardo, a brother of Carmelita who was about to be deported to Sri Lanka from an Indian refugee camp was given a reprieve because of the actions of Human Rights groups. According to JRS South Asia reports. . His family has a history of violent deaths. Two of the brothers were killed in 1995 by rival Tamil militant groups.

She has written most of her screenplays with her screenwriter partner Karen McCullah. Most of the scripts seem to follow the girl Power movement of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Life and career A native of Port Ludlow, Washington, she moved to Los Angeles in 1988 to attend Occidental College. There, she studied English and Film, and also got an internship at CineTel Films, an independent film company. Initially planning on pursuing poetry and academia as a career, she began working for CineTel reading scripts and writing coverage for them. This led to a full-time job there as a Director of Development in 1995; it was there she began pursuing screenwriting in earnest. One of the scripts she happened to read and cover was written by Karen Lutz, an aspiring writer living in Denver, Colorado. The two women formed a friendship over the phone, and when Lutz came to Los Angeles, they met in person, and began writing their first script on cocktail napkins that night. That script never sold, but it inspired the women to write together again, and they embarked on a teen comedy called 10 Things I Hate About You, inspired by William Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew. Smith got her official start as a screenwriter in 1997 by selling 10 Things I Hate About You as a spec screenplay. Shortly thereafter, the movie was green-lit, starring then-unknowns Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles, and it was shot in Tacoma, Washington, near Smith's hometown. Smith went on to co- write Legally Blonde, which was nominated for two Golden Globes. Costing only $18M to produce, the movie was a surprise hit, grossing $20M in its opening weekend in July 2001, and going on to make over $140M worldwide. It also spawned a sequel and a successful Broadway musical, which was a based on Smith and Lutz‚Äôs screenplay. Smith followed that with Ella Enchanted, starring Anne Hathaway, and She's the Man, a DreamWorks update of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, starring Amanda Bynes. In 2008 she wrote and directed a short film,http://www.glamalert.com/reelmoments/#Scene_4 The Spleenectomy, which starred Anna Faris and was financed and produced by Glamour magazine. She also co-wrote and executive produced The House Bunny, starring Anna Faris, and produced by Adam Sandler‚Äôs Happy Madison Productions. It grossed just shy of $50M domestically. Her latest credit is The Ugly Truth, directed by Legally Blonde collaborator Robert Luketic and starring Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler. Her first film as a non-writing producer, Whip It!, starred Ellen Page and was directed by Drew Barrymore, and she also produced American Virgin in 2009, starring Jenna Dewan and Rob Schneider. Having published more than 40 poems in various literary magazines in the 1990s, Smith published her first novel-in-verse, The Geography of Girlhood, in 2006. The coming-of-age story of a teenage girl growing up in the Pacific Northwest, it contains a smattering of the poems Smith wrote and published in her early twenties.

The site for BRUSH SEM was established in 1859, by Count Wallenstein-Vartenberk who set up a branch of his foundry and engineering works in Plze≈à approximately 100 km south west of Prague in the Czech Republic. In 1869, the plant was taken over by Emil ≈†koda, an industrious engineer and dynamic entrepreneur who was quick to expand the business. In the 1880s, ≈†koda established what was then a very modern steelworks capable of delivering castings weighing dozens of tons. Steel castings and, later, forgings for larger passenger liners and warships went on to rank alongside the sugar mills as the top export branches of ≈†koda's factory. In 1899, the ever-expanding business was transformed into a joint-stock company, and before the First World War the ≈†koda Works became the largest arms manufacturer in Austria-Hungary. It was a main contractor to the army and navy supplying mainly heavy guns and ammunition. The First World War brought a drop in the output of peacetime products but huge sums were invested into expanding production capacities for military products. By that time, ≈†koda Works had acquired a number of companies in the Czech Lands and abroad that were not involved in arms manufacture. In 1917, the company had 35,000 employees in Plze≈à. With the emergence of the Czechoslovakia in 1918, and the complex economic conditions of post-war Europe the company was transformed from what was exclusively an arms manufacturer into a multi-sector concern. In addition to traditional branches, the production programme embraced a number of new concepts, such as steam (and later electric) locomotives. aircraft, ships, machine tools, steam turbines, power-engineering equipment, etc. In 1924, the ≈†koda works manufactured their first turbogenerator with an output of 14MW and their first hydro generator in 1926. The deteriorating political situation in Europe saw arms production rise again in the mid-thirties. The Second World War and the company's forced integration into the German weapons programme led to serious damage at the Works themselves (70% of the company complex was destroyed by Allied bombing in April 1945) and the loss of several foreign markets. In 1945, the company was nationalized. ≈†koda Works was gradually split up into different sections (e.g. the car works in Mlad√° Boleslav, the aircraft plant in Prague, factories in Slovakia, and other plants producing food-industry equipment). The company's main task now was to produce equipment for heavy engineering, capital construction in the industrial sector, public transportation, and power engineering. Most exports were headed towards the Eastern Bloc. In 1989 Czechoslovakia broke away from communism and Soviet control and the country was separated into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Until this transition period the ≈†koda Elektrick√© Stroje works primarily manufactured generators and electrical control equipment products for the eastern European and Soviet markets. Following the change in political climate in 1989, ≈†koda started along the path of privatization, and used this time to come up with an optimal production programme, and look for markets other than those co-ordinated through the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA or COMECON), which operated a Centralised Planning System (CPS). The factory followed instructions and manufacture products that were not subjected to the constraints of the western business model of commercial tendering. After 1989, the ≈†koda Elektrick√© Stroje works retained their design technology and manufacturing capability, and attempted to compete and sell their products on the world markets. However, with little international commercial experience and very few orders the business rapidly fell into financial difficulties and the plant was under the threat of closure.

Established in 1973 under the Second Malaysia Plan to comply with Malaysian New Economic Policy, the school is located about a small hill in Bandar Tun Razak, overlooking the scenic Permaisuri Lake. In 2011, the school was awarded the Sekolah Berprestasi Tinggi or High Performance Schoolhttp://www.mstar.com.my/berita/cerita.asp?file=%2F2011%2F2%2F17%2Fmstar_berita%2F20110217141926&sec;=mstar_berita title, awarded to schools in Malaysia that have met stringent criteria including academic achievement, strength of alumni, international recognition, network, and linkages. In the year 2013, the school managed to produce 84 straight A's students out of 120 with GPS 1.06 to be the best schools in Kuala Lumpur.http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v7/bm/ge/newsgeneral.php?id=1002285 The school continue to strive and produce great results in the public examination in the following years. History Sekolah Menengah Sains Selangor is actually located within the boundaries of the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, despite what its name suggests. It is one of the earlier SM Sains schools in the country, hence its name bearing or representing the State of Selangor, prior to the formation of the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur. SMSS is a co-ed school, with students from all the states in Malaysia. The pioneer batch of students which were made up of Form 1 and 4 started in 1973 temporarily placed for a year at three other different schools in High School Kelang, High School Kajang, Sek. Men. Sultan Abdul Aziz, Kajang for the first formers. Meanwhile, the form four students were temporarily placed in Sekolah Alam Shah and Sek. Men KGV, Taiping. They were reunited at the new school in 1974 as Form 2 and 5 students. Later intakes were mostly from Form 1 based on their UPSR excellence, with a trickle coming in at Form 4 based on their PMR results. After more than 34 years of establishment, SMSS now stands tall and proud alongside other more established SBPs like its own sibling rivals like Sekolah Menengah Sains Tengku Muhammad Faris Petra and Sekolah Menengah Sains Raja Tun Azlan Shah. They find themselves locking horns with each other during yearly competitions such as rugby, hockey, debate, wind orchestra and other events organized by the SBP Sector under MOE. Needless to say, Sekolah Menengah Sains Selangor has won their fair share of these competitions, and they would have given a more than worthy challenge for their opponents. The school have been an off-site team challenge for MasterChef Malaysia season 2.http://www.astrogempak.com.my/masterchef/DetailsPage/tabid/1126/ArticleID/52342/MasterChef- Malaysia-2-Cabaran-Sajian-Luar-Pikat-Selera-Pelajar-Asrama.aspx In 2013, in conjunction with the school 40 years celebration, the school were honoured to host the Fully Residential School Excellence Day, while the school also hosted FRSIS (Fully Residential Schools International Symposium) in 2016. Location Situated strategically on top of a small hill in Bandar Tun Razak, Kuala Lumpur; Sekolah Menengah Sains Selangor has one of the most fascinating views overlooking the scenic Permaisuri lake. Its main arch is directly opposite of the Kuala Lumpur Football Stadium, which is in turn adjacent to the Kuala Lumpur Sports Complex and Kuala Lumpur Swimming Complex. It also enjoys having the company of other schools, such as Sekolah Menengah Sains Alam Shah or ASIS, which have replaced the old site of Sekolah Sultan Alam Shah in 2003, Sekolah Menengah Teknik Kuala Lumpur being the oldest technical school in Malaysia that was founded in 1926, Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Seri Permaisuri and Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Cheras as its immediate neighbours.

Students participating in extemporaneous commentary are given 20 minutes to prepare a five-minute speech (with a 30-second grace period) on a topic relevant to modern politics. Students in commentary deliver their speeches sitting down, usually on the opposite side of a table from the judge(s). Students are score based on oration skills, speech organization, and use of sources and are ranked by the judges in comparison to the other competitors who give speeches in the same room. At the beginning of a tournament, students participating in this event are brought to a holding room, where an order is assigned (usually by picking numbers at random). The first student then draws three topics, chooses one which s/he finds best, and then is given his/her 20 minutes of preparation. The remaining students draw their topics at seven- minute intervals to ensure that no student gets extra time to prepare. After all the students have given a speech, the judges rank the students in order of who they believed performed the best based on the categories above. Originally, extemporaneous commentary topics were more general and more focused on opinions than extemporaneous topics were, making extemp commentary an almost \\"halfway point\\" between impromptu speaking and normal extemp. However, the success of those who integrated more sources into their speeches, plus the trending of the topics to mimic extemp's, has blurred the line between extemporaneous and extemporaneous commentary. In some cases extemp commentary has a shorter prep time, and shorter speeches. The only definitive difference between extemp and extemp commentary is the position in which the speeches are given (standing as opposed to sitting).

Flow-based system design is well-suited to field-programmable gate array design as it is easier to specify the innate parallelism of the architecture.  History The use of flow-based design tools in engineering is a reasonably new trend. Unified Modeling Language is the most widely used example for software design.

Originally the Lorimer Street streetcar line, it is now a bus route operated by MTA New York City Bus. Route description The B48 bus route starts at Lincoln Road and Flatbush Avenue in Flatbush, near Prospect Park Station. From there, buses head north on Classon Avenue and south on Franklin Avenue through Flatbush, Crown Heights, and Bedford- Stuyvesant to Flushing Avenue. Once it reaches Flushing Avenue, the B48 turns onto Wallabout Street and Flushing Avenue and then heads north on Lorimer Street. From there, buses run along the length of Lorimer Street until Nassau Avenue. The route then shifts onto Nassau Avenue, and heads east on that street until it ends at Meeker Avenue and Stewart Avenue in Greenpoint, near the Newtown Creek. History= Trolley service  The Greenpoint and Lorimer Street Railroad was incorporated on November 6, 1884 to operate along the New Williamsburgh and Flatbush Railroad (Nostrand Avenue Line) from the Broadway Ferry in Williamsburg southeast to Lorimer Street, and then north on Lorimer Street, east on Driggs Avenue, north on Manhattan Avenue, west on Meserole Avenue, north on Franklin Street, and west on Greenpoint Avenue to the Greenpoint Ferry; southbound cars would use Nassau Avenue to Lorimer Street. In addition to the NW&F;, this route used the tracks of several other companies: the Brooklyn Crosstown Railroad's Crosstown Line on Driggs Avenue and Manhattan Avenue, the Brooklyn City Rail Road's Greenpoint Line on Franklin Street, and the Bushwick Railroad's Bushwick Avenue Line on Greenpoint Avenue. The franchise was approved on February 26, 1885, and the line was opened by August. The NW&F; soon leased the G&LS;, and Lorimer Street cars were sent south on the Nostrand Avenue Line to Prospect Park. In July 1889 the Brooklyn City Rail Road leased them both, and rerouted all cars but one per day (to preserve the charter) from Meserole Avenue to Greenpoint Avenue. Beginning May 30, 1896, the Lorimer Street Line was extended southeast from Prospect Park along the Flatbush Avenue Line and new Bergen Beach Line to Bergen Beach during the summer season. At some point, the line was extended to Park Circle via Ocean Avenue and Parkside Avenue. When the Franklin Avenue Line was discontinued on October 28, 1945, Lorimer Street cars were rerouted to cut west on the Flushing Avenue Line and south on Franklin Avenue to Prospect Park. The north end was rerouted to absorb the Nassau Avenue Line east of Manhattan Avenue, ending near Newtown Creek, when that line was discontinued the same day. Bus service Buses replaced streetcars on December 14, 1947, then were replaced with trolley buses from March 23, 1949 to July 27, 1960.Brooklyn Trackless Trolleys (NYCBus.org) The route now runs northbound on Classon Avenue rather than Franklin Avenue; the south end was truncated back to the east side of Prospect Park. From 2010 to 2013 it was further truncated to Atlantic Avenue. On January 6, 2019 the B13, B48, B57 and the B60 buses were moved from Grand Avenue Depot in Maspeth, Queens to the Fresh Pond Depot in Fresh Pond, Queens.http://www.mta.info/press-release/nyc- transit/mta-new-york-city-transit-implements-bus-service-enhancements-2013 References Streetcar lines in Brooklyn B048 B048 ","title":"B48 (New York City bus)"},{"id":"9648824","text":"Nationality words link to articles with information on the nation's poetry or literature (for instance, Irish or France).

It was published in 2001 by Putnam in America and Bantam in the United Kingdom. It is written in the third person. Plot summary Jack Reacher breaks a bully's nose and finger after being repeatedly provoked in a Texas saloon, so when the bully turns out to be a local cop and shows up with three of his colleagues the following day to arrest him, Reacher decides it's time to move on. He chooses hitchhiking as the fastest escape and hooks up with a driver of Mexican heritage named Carmen Greer. She says that the only reason she stopped, however, is because she has a problem: Her tax-evading husband, Sloop, is coming out of prison soon, and he will inevitably continue beating her as he did so many times before, especially because he knows she was the one who informed on him. Carmen has been diligently searching for candidates to kill him, and she thinks Reacher's military background may qualify him for the job. Reacher initially refuses and even leaps out of the car and back into the sweltering 110-degree (Fahrenheit) heat, but then he expeditiously changes his mind and agrees to accept a ride back to her ranch. It is there that Carmen, her husband Sloop and the rest of his family live, and Reacher is promising nothing more than to look into the situation and, if necessary, to act as her bodyguard. Carmen and Jack then proceed to pick up her daughter Ellie, who gets on well with Reacher. Meanwhile, two other groups are introduced: a group of watchers, composed of two men and a boy who have been staking out the ranch, and a trio of hitmen (two men and one woman) who subsequently kill the first group on the orders of their mutual employer after murdering Al Eugene, the lawyer who had secured Sloop's release. Carmen and Reacher arrive back at the ranch, but Reacher does not receive a warm welcome from Sloop's bigoted mother, brother, or the two ranchers who work there. Reacher gets the Greers to hire him as a wrangler, and teaches Carmen how to handle a firearm. The family orders the other ranchers to dispose of Reacher; he subdues them and returns unharmed. Sloop then arrives, and claims Jack is trespassing; he is arrested and removed by Texas Rangers. En route, the rangers are called back: Sloop has been shot and killed, and the authorities charge Carmen with the murder after finding a gun. Furthermore, while she is incarcerated, she suddenly confesses to the murder and assiduously denies legal help from Alice Amanda Aaron, the pro bono attorney whom Reacher procures for her. Assisted by Hack Walker, the Pecos County district attorney and an old friend of Sloop's, Jack and Alice discover a cover-up related to the murder of several illegal immigrants by Hack, Sloop, and Eugene. Reacher concludes that Hack orchestrated the murders in order to protect his election chances, and that he is pressuring Carmen to confess by threatening Ellie's life. Reacher kills two of the hitmen in an ambush and confronts Hack at the ranch, whereupon Sloop's mother kills him as a fire breaks out and burns down their house. After tracking down and subduing the third man at a motel, preventing him from killing Ellie, Reacher leaves Carmen to start a new life as he prepares to look for a ride out of Texas. Production Child finished writing Echo Burning in March 2000. The book was released in the United Kingdom and its territories on 2 April 2001, and the American publication followed on 25 June of the same year. The original idea for Echo Burning came from two sources. The first was an idea he had in which he wondered what it would be like for a woman whose husband was returning home from jail, but didn't want him to return. He also took inspiration from seeing the grave of the gunfighter Clay Allison who \\"never killed a man that did not need killing.\\" He wondered what it would be like if Reacher was confronted by a man he had been told needed killing. Child wanted Carmen Greer to appear as a character whom readers would not know whether or not to trust. He has also said how he wanted Alice Amanda Aaron, the Harvard educated, vegetarian, lesbian, attorney Reacher hires, to be a reflection of how diverse America is; he can be quoted as saying \\"she's totally normal in New York, but a freak in Texas.\\"  Reception  Echo Burning was well received by critics. In a starred review, book review journal Kirkus Reviews called it \\"Smashingly suspenseful,\\" and said \\"Child builds tension to unbearable extremes, then blows it out in sharply choreographed violence.\\" The Denver Post called it \\"...a story you can sink your teeth into.\\" Many critics considered this as one of the best books of the year, with the Boston Globe even calling it \\"The best mystery I [the reviewer] have read this year.\\" In the United Kingdom the book was also well received, with the Daily Mail saying: \\"In the space of less than five years, Child has established himself as one of Britain's most successful commercial novelists. [Echo Burning is] Child's breakthrough book into the mega-sellers. He is that good.\\" ReferencesExternal links *['http://www.leechild.com/books/echo-burning.php' Echo Burning information page on Lee Child's Official Website] 2001 British novels Domestic violence in fiction Jack Reacher books Novels set in Texas Pecos County, Texas ","title":"Echo Burning"},{"id":"9648883","text":"Nationality words link to articles with information on the nation's poetry or literature (for instance, Irish or France).

It was published by Putnam in 2002. It is written in the third person. In the novel, retired military police officer Jack Reacher is asked by the Secret Service to help track down assassins who are threatening the Vice- President-Elect. Plot Jack Reacher arrives in Atlantic City after hitching a ride cross-country with a couple of aging blues musicians who dream of playing at B.B. King's club in New York City. He is approached there by Secret Service Agent M.E. Froelich, who had dated Reacher's brother Joe, a fellow Secret Service agent, before his death (Killing Floor). Froelich hires Reacher to conduct a \\"security audit\\" of the Secret Service's protection of Vice President-elect Brook Armstrong, the junior senator from North Dakota. Armstrong attends a meeting and photo-op with prominent bankers on Wall Street, a campaign event in Bismarck with the newly elected senator from North Dakota, and a fundraising event in Washington, D.C. Reacher reveals to Froelich that he hired his old colleague from the military police, Chicago security consultant Frances Neagley, to help with the \\"audit.\\" Working together, Reacher and Neagley say that they could have killed the Vice President three times for sure, and once probably, in three days. Froelich reveals that the Secret Service has been receiving letters from someone threatening to kill Armstrong. She and her supervisor, a man named Stuyvesant, agree to hire Reacher and Neagley to help their investigation. Reacher tries on one of his brother's suits, and Froelich sleeps with him. Froelich asks why Neagley and Reacher never had a relationship, and he tells her that, for reasons she will not disclose, Neagley has a fear of being touched by others. The would-be assassins kill two men, one in Colorado and one in Minnesota, who resemble the Vice President and also have the name \\"B. Armstrong,\\" as a warning message. A killer appears at another event in Bismarck, but Reacher breaks into the church tower where they were hiding out and they flee without a trace. On Thanksgiving Day, Armstrong is scheduled to serve food at a lunch buffet at a homeless shelter. Reacher and Neagley argue that Armstrong should be warned, and that the event should be cancelled. Stuyvesant agrees to bring in the F.B.I. for help; they send Special Agent Bannon, who concludes based on the weapons used in the Colorado and Minnesota homicides that a Secret Service agent is behind the killings. Froelich moves the benefit lunch outside, where the Secret Service can better control who gets close to Armstrong. On Thanksgiving, Froelich meticulously secures the area. Ten agents look over the homeless people as they line up to get food from Armstrong, and snipers are posted on the only rooftop that has a clear shot at the Vice President. An assassin kills a Secret Service sniper named Crosetti, and fires at Armstrong twice. They miss with the first shot, and Froelich covers the Vice President from the second. Fatally struck in the neck, Froelich becomes delirious with blood loss in Reacher's arms. She tells him \\"I love you, Joe,\\" to which Reacher replies \\"I love you too.\\" Against the recommendations of Stuyvesant and Bannon, Armstrong agrees to Reacher's demands that he publicly announce he will attend a funeral for Froelich in her hometown of Grace, Wyoming, to lure the killers out into the open. Armstrong insists that his protection detail be limited to three men, out of respect for Froelich's family. Reacher remembers seeing the Thanksgiving Day shooter running with a badge during the assassination attempt in Bismarck, and concludes that the killers are policemen. Reacher also deduces that the assassins are motivated by some personal feud with Armstrong. The Vice President confesses that, as a teenager in rural Oregon, he stood by as his father brutally beat two local bullies with a baseball bat. Armstrong reveals that he received a broken baseball bat in the mail from the killers, something the Secret Service did not pick up on during their postal screening. Reacher and Neagley fly to Denver and drive to Grace, arriving the day before the funeral. Staking out the church steeple, they watch the assassins arrive and ambush them the morning of the funeral.

The complex has been referred to as \\"the greatest known concentration of mechanical power in the ancient world\\" and the sixteen overshot wheels are considered the biggest ancient mill complex.Kevin Greene, \\"Technological Innovation and Economic Progress in the Ancient World: M.I. Finley Re- Considered\\", The Economic History Review, New Series, Vol. 53, No. 1. (Feb., 2000), pp. 29-59 (39) Their capacity for milling flour fed about 1/4 of Arles. Another similar mill complex existed also on the Janiculum in Rome, and there are suggestions that more such complexes exist at other major Roman sites, such as Amida.  Description  Model of the water mills at Barbegal in Mus√©e de l'Arles antique The Barbegal mills are located 12 kilometers north of Arles near Fontvieille, where the Arles aqueduct arrived at a steep hill. The mills consisted of 16 waterwheels in two parallel sets of eight descending a steep hillside. There are substantial masonry remains of the water channels and foundations of the individual mills, together with a staircase rising up the hill upon which the mills are built. The mills operated from the end of the 1st century until about the end of the 3rd century. The capacity of the mills has been estimated at 4.5 tons of flour per day, enough to supply bread for as many as 10,000Cleere, 2001 of perhaps 30-40,000 inhabitants of Arelate at that time.La meunerie de Barbegal It is thought that the wheels were overshot water wheels with the outflows driving successive wheels to the base of the hill. The Roman aqueducts that fed the mills were also built to supply water to the town of Arles (then called Arelate). The two aqueducts joined just north of the mill complex and a sluice controlled the water supply to the complex. Barbegal mill 06.jpgMill Barbegal aqueduct 04.jpgAqueduct Barbegal mill 05.jpgRemains of the complex Barbegal mill 02.jpgThe sixteen overshot wheels Other mills Vertical water mills were well known to the Romans, being described by Vitruvius in his De architectura of 25 BC,Vitruvius, De Architectura, X, 5 and mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Histori√¶ of 77 AD. There are also later references to floating water mills from Byzantium and to sawmills on the river Moselle by the poet Ausonius. The use of multiple stacked sequences of reverse overshot water-wheels was widespread in Roman mines, especially in Spain and Wales. It is possible that the mills at Barbegal may also have been used for sawing timber and stone when not grinding wheat. The Hierapolis sawmill from the 3rd century AD shows a crank- activated frame saw being used in this way, and another has been excavated at Ephesus. Visiting the site Visitors to Barbegal may park where a minor road crosses the massive remains of the original aqueduct, and walk south about 250 meters along the remains of the aqueduct through the cleft in the ridge to the top of the mill complex. The site is signposted as Roman aqueduct rather than as a mill. The Arles Museum of Antiquity has an informative reconstructed model of the mill. The site is currently overgrown, and care is needed exploring the ruins. Influence The English science historian James Burke examines Roman watermill technology such as that of the Barbegal aqueduct and mill, concluding that it influenced the Cistercians and their waterpower, which in turn influenced the Industrial Revolution, in the fourth of his ten-part Connections, called \\"Faith in Numbers.\\" See also * List of Roman watermills * Janiculum, a hill in western Rome, featuring a similar site * Roman technology * Roman engineering  References  Further reading  * Amouretti, M.-C.: 'Barbegal: de l'histoire des fouilles a l'histoire des moulins', Provence Historique, 167-8 (1992), pp. 135‚Äì49 * Bellamy, R.

Early life and education Cerith is the son of Sulwyn and Myfanwy Evans and was educated at Ysgol Dewi Sant Llanelli and at Llanelli Boys Grammar School. Sulwyn his father was a noted photographer and painter. Cerith is a fluent Welsh speaker. Wyn Evans completed a foundation course at Dyfed College of Art (1976‚Äì77), and later studied at Saint Martin's School of Art (1977‚Äì80), while working as an invigilator at the Tate, and the Royal College of Art (1981‚Äì84). Among his teachers at Saint Martin's was conceptual artist John Stezaker.Innocence and Experience ‚Äì frieze talks to Cerith Wyn Evans , Frieze, Issue 71, November‚ÄìDecember 2002. Wyn Evans then served as an assistant to Derek Jarman, with whom he worked on The Angelic Conversation (1985), Caravaggio (1986), and The Last of England (1987). His early experimental film work in the 1980s often concentrated on dancers including collaborations with Michael Clark. In 1988, his short film Degrees of Blindness, starring Tilda Swinton, was shown at the Chicago International Film Festival. He also collaborated on noted pop videos with bands including The Smiths and Throbbing Gristle. Work Although Wyn Evans moved to sculpture and installation in the early 1990s, the influence of film remained strong on his work.Cerith Wyn Evans Tate. Most of the artist's work stems from his strong interest in language and communication, often using found or remembered texts from film, philosophy or literature combined with a clean aesthetic.Cerith Wyn Evans Ingleby Gallery, Edinburgh. Writing in Frieze, in 1999, Jennifer Higgie said: \\"Wyn Evans‚Äô use of repetition and elliptical meaning indicates endless possible readings his choice of a quote replete with both classical and personal implications placed at the junction of earth and sea nods to Platonic ideas about renewal, while the decaying beach reflects a more negative image of repetition as a kind of dead end, a form of stasis.\\"Jennifer Higgie \\"Cerith Wyn Evans \\" Frieze, June‚ÄìAugust 1999.

In his earlier Cleave installations, he refracted the light signals of Morse code off a rotating mirror ball to create dazzling and intense sensory environments. The artist is also interested in the way that soundtracks form a parallel 'text' for a film or photograph and in the slippage created when these sounds are dislodged, changed or removed.Cerith Wyn Evans: The Curves of the Needle, 20 April ‚Äì 19 May 2006 White Cube, London.

It is written in the first person. Plot Jack Reacher is working unofficially with the DEA to bring down a boy's father, Zachary Beck, who is suspected of smuggling drugs under the pretext of trading in oriental carpets. They stage a kidnap effort on Zachary's son, Richard Beck. A frightened Richard places his trust in Reacher and asks him to take him back home. Reacher gains access to Beck and gradually gains his confidence by working as a hired gun/bodyguard. While working undercover he regrettably has to eliminate a few of Beck's minions to prevent them from exposing him. During this time he figures out that he was not the only undercover agent appointed to keep track of Zachary Beck. The house maid, too, turns out to be a federal agent trying to find evidence of arms smuggling against Zachary. The DEA, on finding that they were mistaken about the nature of the business Zachary was involved in, tries to pull Reacher out. Reacher refuses to step back as his primary motivation in getting involved at all in this off-the-books operation is to have another go at Francis Xavier Quinn, a former Military Intelligence agent who, ten years before, had brutally mutilated and murdered a female military colleague of Reacher's. Reacher had originally presumed Quinn to be dead after their last little encounter but found that assumption to be incorrect after running into Quinn in public. It's ten years later and Quinn somehow just happens to be Zachary Beck's boss in a supremely lucrative, international gun-running enterprise. And it is revealed that Zachary was forced into working for Quinn and his family was tormented by bodyguards appointed by Quinn. As always, it is Reacher's all-consuming obsession with revenge, or at least with his personal interpretation of doling out justice, which pushes him far beyond the normal boundaries of physical endurance and acceptable risk. Critical reception Leslie Doran of The Denver Post said that the novel had a \\"gripping and suspenseful opening\\" and that \\"for returning Reacher fans...beginning scenes will cause extra suspense\\". Patrick Anderson of The Washington Post described it as \\"a skillful blend of sex, violence, sadism, weaponry, spies, smuggling, revenge, deception, suspense and nonstop action\\", though he also notes that the novel has \\"several premises that are hard to swallow\\". After a short description of how quickly he read through the earlier books in the series after reading Persuader, Dale Jones of The Gazette simply stated \\"You might say I liked it\\".

Asprin credits the song \\"Reminder\\" by Buck Coulson as his inspiration for the novel.Dedicated and credited under copyright information The lyrics of the song are printed at the beginning of some editions of the book. Plot summary Bug Wars takes place an unspecified length of time before the present, in an unspecified part of the galaxy. The song \\"Reminder,\\" would suggest that it is at least one million years. Opening with the main character, Rahm, waking from stasis, the book covers his campaigns as part of the Tzen Warrior caste against a coalition of large Insect species; the Wasps, Leapers, and Ants, in that order. After a mission to destroy the Wasp nests and queens on a planet, the Tzen intend to colonize. However, because of Tzen military practices, that a task force leaves after a predicted proportion of units return, assuming that all others are casualties, Rahm's flight group was stranded on the planet. The Tzen would return in a year to eliminate the Leapers, insects not unlike a praying mantis. While stranded, the team made a number of discoveries, chief among which was the fact that the Tzen needed to find a natural predator of the Leapers to defeat them. The standard practice for the Tzen is to kill the next generation of insects before it is born, then return later to kill any remaining adults. The Leapers are immune to this, however, because they are all capable of reproduction, and bury their eggs, making them impossible to eradicate without levying resources unavailable to the Tzen Empire. After the Empire returns as planned to eradicate the leapers, they retreat and begin looking for a creature that eats insect eggs. Rahm is selected to lead a team of Tzen from each caste to find such a creature. When they set up a pre-fabricated building as their base, they soon discover a number of hostile flora and fauna, including a plant with toxic thorns, Spiders, and a colony of Ants near their base. Several of the team are captured by the Ants, and learn that they are intelligent and capable of telepathic communication. When the team discovers a suitable creature, they round up as many as they can, but are hounded by the insects. The mission culminates in a battle between the Tzen and Insects at the base. After the leapers have been defeated, Rahm is selected to lead a campaign against the Ants as a Planetary Commander. The mission is considered almost suicidal, with a casualty estimate of at least seventy percent. In the middle of the battle, Rahm discovers that, while they have eliminated the Ants primary power source, they had a reserve strong enough for one use of a power-consuming device. One colony used theirs for cold-beam lasers, another used it to launch an escape shuttle, which was promptly destroyed. After defeating the Ants, Rahm returned to stasis, to be reawakened whenever the empire needed him.

Set in Paris, it spans eight hours in the life of its protagonist, Dick.John Rodker, Poems & Adolphe 1920, ed. Andrew Crozier (Manchester: Carcanet, 1996) It is similar in many respects to James Joyce's Ulysses and Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway in its use of stream-of-consciousness narration and the limiting of the action to just one day. In this sense it is very much a modernist text. Dick is a manic narrator, and reminiscent of Septimus Smith, the shell-shocked war veteran of Woolf's Mrs.Dalloway. There are several references to the after effects of the First World War, and the novella's fractured nature could be seen as a metaphor for fractured post-war Europe. Plot summary The novella is split into eight sections - each spanning roughly an hour. The narrative is fragmented, often making it difficult to tell who is talking or thinking, or whether events are occurring in the present or being recalled. Section I Dick awakes to find a fair being set up in the street outside. He recalls a visit he took to Bordeaux with his ex-lover Angela. They visited a crypt. He watches a film of a Victorian woman undressing in a mutoscope. Section II He returns to the crowd in the street and becomes nauseous as he is swept up by the mass of people. He meets the Snake-lady and propositions her - she accepts. He becomes lost in the crowd again, then is found by Monica, who is possibly his current girlfriend. Section III They enter a tent with waxwork displays of body parts, and disfigured people with what appear to be war-wounds. Dick picks up a dwarf. He and Monica kiss. He flees and watches another mutoscope film of a head biting a neck. He expresses a desire to rest. Section IV He returns to his bedroom and dreams of Angela. He wakes as Monica enters. He gazes at her, they kiss, then he takes her outside back into the crowd and slips away from her. Section V He leaves the crowd. He becomes confused and begins to daydream about Angela and his regret for love. Section VI He re-enters the fair and sees five wrestlers: a bear, a fat wrestler, a thin wrestler, a large woman, and a \\"flour-white-faced boy\\". They fight and the woman wins. Dick is disgusted by this. He then sees the ghost of Angela in the crowd, and has another daydream in a tent. He watches a projected film in which a face gets larger and larger on the screen. Section VII He collects Monica from his room and they go to a restaurant and then an aquarium. He has a vision of Angela as Undine. Section VIII Angela returns and Monica is forced to leave. Monica returns with an unnamed escort. They pick up the Snake-lady from the fair and all five go to a club. In the club Dick specifically notes the jazz musicians, black waiters, dancers, and a singer. An unidentified black man sits with them and plays with the snake. Dick talks with Angela in an anteroom. He starts to stack glasses on one another: they topple over after Angela tells him to stop. Dick becomes delirious and returns home in a taxi. He goes to sleep. Praise and criticism Ezra Pound, writing for The Dial in November 1928, believed the novel to be one of only two \\"offspring from Ulysses...possessing any value.\\" References 1929 British novels British novellas Novels by John Rodker Novels set in Paris ","title":"Adolphe 1920"},{"id":"9648981","text":"Colonel Henry William Lowry-Corry DL, JP (30 June 1845 ‚Äì 6 May 1927), styled The Honourable from birth, was a British Army officer and Conservative politician.

It is narrated in the first person. Plot summary In the last hours of 1989, Major Gen. Kenneth Kramer dies of a heart attack in a seedy North Carolina motel, apparently while in the company of a prostitute. MP Maj. Jack Reacher investigates and comes to the conclusion that the woman Kramer was with stole his briefcase. Reacher's superior, Col. Leon Garber, orders him to deliver news of the general's death to his wife. Accompanied by a female officer, Lieutenant Summer, Reacher travels to her house in Virginia. When they arrive, however, they find evidence of a break-in, as well as Mrs. Kramer's body. Reacher returns to the bar across the street from the motel in an attempt to identify the alleged prostitute. He gets into a fight with a bouncer, breaking his knee. Afterwards, Reacher is told by the motel's night clerk that he heard a military vehicle leaving after Kramer's death, and Reacher concludes that the woman Kramer was with is a female army officer. He is later confronted by two officers, Col. Coomer and Brigadier Gen. Vassell, members of Kramer's staff, who inquire about the briefcase but leave after Reacher mentions Ms. Kramer's death. Later, a Delta Force soldier, Christopher Carbone, is found murdered in a manner that suggests he was gay. Garber is suddenly transferred to a new command in South Korea and replaced with Col. Willard, a deeply unpleasant bureaucrat who instructs Reacher to write off Carbone's death as an accident. He also reveals that Carbone filed a complaint against Reacher accusing him of assaulting the bouncer, and that he intends to use it as evidence that Reacher killed Carbone unless he closes the investigation quickly. Shortly thereafter, another murder is reported: David Brubaker, Carbone's CO, is shot dead in a Columbia alleyway with money and heroin in his pocket. Believing that the two murders are connected, Reacher and Summer focus on the one thing missing from Kramer's newly recovered briefcase: the printed agenda from a conference he was supposed to attend for members of the armored divisions. Coomer and Vassell deny that such an agenda exists, and Willard begins to turn up the pressure on Reacher, forcing him to rely on his wits, contacts in the military police, and years of experience as he tries to unravel the true reason why Kramer's briefcase was stolen. In the midst of it all, he receives a call from his older brother Joe informing him that his elderly mother Josephine has died from cancer in Paris. Despite having been assured by Josephine earlier that she was ready to die, Reacher feels her loss immensely. After returning to the United States with Summer following his mother's funeral, Reacher secures a meeting with the Chief of Staff, and reveals his findings: with the collapse of the Soviet Union imminent, the army is preparing to downsize its armored units in favor of infantry, and Kramer and his fellow officers, not wanting to lose their prestigious jobs and perks, were preparing to orchestrate an elaborate public relations and lobbying scheme to persuade Congress and the American people to reject the plan. Having foreseen this, the Chief admits that he arranged for twenty of the army's best investigators, including Reacher, to be assigned to specific posts across the world on a specific day, using forged orders from Garber, so that they would be in a position to prevent such manipulations. He provides Reacher with evidence of his claims, and notes that the Secretary of Defense was also working with the plotters. Reacher deduces that Kramer was gay, and that he met Carbone at the motel, who stole his briefcase when he died and informed Brubaker of the contents. He also set up Reacher to be charged with assault to cover his tracks. Coomer and Vassell, eager to recover the briefcase, set up an exchange between Carbone and their gofer Maj. Marshall; Marshall killed Carbone and then murdered Brubaker as well before he could use the information. He also killed Ms. Kramer while searching her house for the case; Reacher realizes that Marshall also had a relationship with Kramer and killed his wife out of anger and jealousy. Reacher travels to California and arrests Vassell and Coomer for conspiracy to commit homicide. He then travels to a firing range in the Mojave Desert where Marshall is conducting firing exercises to arrest him as well. Marshall attempts to commit suicide by maneuvering the tanks into firing on his position, but Reacher shoots him in the shoulder and takes him into custody. The missing agenda is subsequently retrieved from Carbone's billet: it contains a plan to assassinate eighteen prominent infantry officers, including many rising stars, to cripple their modernization efforts. The evidence is turned over to military authorities, and the accused are sentenced to life imprisonment for their crimes. Reacher is informed that, due to the charge filed by Carbone, he will be demoted to captain unless he denies it, which his lawyer encourages him to do. Instead, Reacher accepts the charge to avoid disgracing Carbone's memory further, and looks forward to serving on the front lines again. Before accepting his new command, he tracks down the corrupt Willard and executes him in his own house, planting drugs on the body to hide his involvement. The story ends with Reacher reflecting on the fact that he never saw Summer again despite hearing that she also received a promotion to captain.

This can be when the maker or drawer of a negotiable instrument, such as a promissory note or check, is induced to sign the instrument without a reasonable opportunity to learn of its fraudulent character or essential terms. Determination of whether an act constitutes fraud in the factum depends upon consideration of \\"all relevant factors\\". Fraud in the factum usually voids the instrument under state law and is a real defense against even a holder in due course. Contrast this with the situation where a trusted employee signs a check without permission. The employer must still honor the check despite the fact that the check was a fraudulent negotiable instrument. Here, the employer had a reasonable opportunity to avoid the obligation by restricting access to the checks. Fraud in the factum is often contrasted with fraud in the inducement. * Fraud in the factum is a legal defense, and occurs where A makes/signs an agreement, but either does not realize that it is supposed to be a contract, or does not understand the nature/content of the agreement, because of some false information that B gave to A. For example, suppose John tells his mother that he is taking a college course on Handwriting Analysis, and for his homework he needs her to read and sign a pretend deed. If Mom signs the deed believing what he told her, and John tries to enforce the deed, Mom can plead \\"fraud in the factum\\". * Fraud in the inducement is an equitable defense, and occurs when A enters into an agreement, knowing that it is supposed to be a contract and (at least having a rough idea) what the agreement is about, but the reason A signed/made the agreement was because of some false information that B gave to A. For example, suppose John tells his mother to sign a deed giving him her property, Mom refuses at first, but then John falsely tells her that the bank will foreclose on the property unless she signs it over to him. If Mom signs the deed because of this statement from John, and John tries to enforce the deed, Mom can plead \\"fraud in the inducement\\".

In response to a journalist's shouted comment that the last British amateur world road champion had been Dave Marsh 45 years earlier, Webb retorted: \\"And they'll have to wait another 45 years before another British rider wins.\\"Interview, Procycling March 2007 Not only did no British man win a world road race championship in the following 45 years, but none can now win the amateur championship as the segregation between amateur and professional cycling no longer exists. Biography=Early days Graham Webb was born on 13 January 1944, as the youngest of five children brought up by a war widow in a slum in Birmingham, England. He was given the last rites twice as a child before gaining his health. He got his first bike when he was eight and soon enjoyed going not only on long rides, but rides of such length that they were beyond him. He began riding from Birmingham to Gloucester and back, just because it was a magical round trip, and persisted until he could do it without literally falling into a ditch from exhaustion. He succeeded 'non-stop' only on his third attempt. \\"I just enjoyed doing it,\\" he said. \\"I enjoyed suffering, I suppose. I still do.\\"Cycling Heroes, Les Woodland, Springfield Books UK, 1994 Webb entered his first race aged 17, a time trial. Unaware of what he was supposed to do, shy and not understanding why competitors were starting individually as opposed to together in a bunch, Webb waited until he was called, by which point, he was late for his allocated start time; the time was calculated from the allocated start time instead of his actual start time as a penalty. Wearing a T-shirt and pumps, Webb set off under the impression that he had to catch the riders that had started ahead of him in order to win. He was hampered initially as one of his pumps fell off and he had to wait for cars to pass before being able to return to collect his shoe and continue. Webb later commented that \\"I quickly caught someone and waited for him. And he was telling me 'clear off, clear off' ‚Äì very unsociable, I thought. I rode on, went round the turn in the road, came back; and the chain jumped off between the block and the frame. So I had to get off the bike, and I'd got a whole tool kit with me, spanner, oil can, cloth for cleaning my hands and so on, and this was wrapped round my seat tube with a spare inner tube. I had to undo the back wheel, put the chain on, do up the wheel nuts, put everything behind the seat tube and carry on.\\" The following Thursday evening, Webb went to his club meeting; as usual he stood painfully shy to one side. Eventually he was asked if he was Graham Webb, because if he was, he was the winner of the race. He had ridden the 25 miles in 1 hour 1 minute and 31 seconds. Had it not been for the penalty of the late start and mechanical trouble, Webb would have broken the hour on an ordinary sports bicycle; at a time when to ride 25 miles in less than an hour was still the dream of most experienced cyclists. Racing career Webb spent the next years competing in several time trials and often won mass-start events on the road. Attempts to ride well in the British national track team, according to Webb, were hindered by the team's persistent lack of morale and ambition. On a Monday evening in 1966 at Salford Park, Birmingham, having led his team to win the National Team Pursuit Championships the previous Saturday, Webb set new national track records at 10 miles, 25 miles and 1 hour; on a track which had shallow bankings and bumpy tarmac, and on which it was deemed impossible to set any kind of record. The 10 mile record had never previously been set during an hour record attempt; spectators were shouting at Webb to \\"slow down, you'll not last the distance at that speed!\\". Webb took no notice and went on to beat the old hour record by approximately 400 metres. His new record remained unbeaten for many years. In 1967, Webb and his wife sold all they owned and moved to Hilversum in the Netherlands, where a Dutch journalist and race organiser, Charles Ruys, had offered to find him a club and accommodation. In his first Dutch race, a semi- classic called the Omloop van de Baronie, Webb crashed over a river bank and finished 16th dripping mud and slime. After that he began winning regularly, often lapping the field several times at criteriums. Webb's attempts at the World Track Championship in 1967 came to nothing. He trained between 200 and 300 kilometres a day for the World Road Race Championship which followed a week later. Webb got into the important breakaway in this race but dropped back to help a fellow British rider, Peter Buckley, up to the front, on his return to the front of the race Webb discovered that a handful of riders had broken away. Webb led the chase, dropping Buckley in the process, and took the lead in a corner late in the race, accelerating clear to win alone. Turning professional Webb turned professional in 1968 for the Mercier team which included Raymond Poulidor and another French star, Jean Stablinski, although things started going wrong from the moment a shipping strike stranded him in Sardinia, where he had been training, forcing him to miss the team's first race. On his return home to Belgium, his racing equipment was stolen from his car, which was parked at the time in the center of Turin, Italy. This was only two days before his first professional race, the then classic Omloop Het Volk. Mechanical trouble in the Omloop Het Volk, followed by knee pain in Kuurne- Brussels-Kuurne meant that by the time he was fit to ride Paris-Nice, the team's leaders had abandoned him to the extent that he found himself alone in the rain at the end of the first stage, he left his bike in a bar in Paris and was given a lift home by a spectator. Webb rode a further year as a professional but without success. He opened a bar and had his world champion's rainbow jersey on display; when it became dirty from cigarette smoke, and as depression rose over what could have been, Webb took it down and threw it in the fire. Webb was later employed at a steel works in Ghent, as a crane operator. He never lived in Britain again, saying he was glad to leave as it had too many memories of abuse and poverty. Webb raced successfully as an amateur, especially on the track, but became seriously unwell when he suffered an abdominal aortic aneurysm whilst riding in Ghent. Restored to close to normal health, Webb was a regular figure at bike races in Belgium. His two links with his former country were his willingness to help British riders trying to race in Belgium (although he claimed the British Cycling Federation never replied to his offer to work without pay as its permanent representative there) and his passion for MGB sports cars, which he drove from his home at Wachtebeke north of Ghent. Honours In 2007, Webb was acknowledged by his home town, Birmingham, on the birmingham.gov.uk web site, as a famous 'Brummie'.. birmingham.gov.uk In 2009, he was inducted into the British Cycling Hall of Fame.

It is located 7 km from Sabadell and 11 km from Terrassa, the comarca's two capitals. Other villages near Castellar del Vall√®s are Sant Lloren√ß Savall, Matadepera and Sentmenat. History The first evidence of human presence dates to 7000 BCE, although there is evidence of agricultural activity in the Neolithic, around 5000 BCE. The continuation of human presence is confirmed by twentieth one of funereal urns dated in the 7th century BCE, which were located in the Plan of La Bruguera, in the municipal term with formed posterity, for a small necropolis of the age of the iron. In 2005, the remodelling of the centre of Castellar revealed archaeological finds that confirm the presence of a city of late Roman period, with funereal remains and others related with agricultural activity in the 4th and 5th centuries, later substituted by a Visigothic settlement in the 6th to 13th centuries. A part of the original village of Castellar Vell, excavated between 1995 and 2001, dates to the Carolingian period. A cemetery was located here, with 250 burials of the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries. The people of the village have been traditionally tied to the marquises of Castellar, who now live in Barcelona. From 1968-2006 there were 181 forest fires or attempts at fires, affecting an area of 470.8 hectares. The largest fire during this period took place in July 1983, and burned 75 hectares in the Old Shoemaker region. There have been 23 fires in the last 10 years, affecting 5.7 hectares; these are much smaller than the great forest fire of Sant Lloren√ß de Savall in August 2003, where 2,953.85 hectares burned. The largest snowfalls in this area came in 1962 and 2001, and there was an historic flood in September 1962, which damaged the Tolr√† factory in Can Barba, the bridge over the Brunet and farmland near the Ripoll river. Economy La Pla√ßa Llibertat (Freedom Square) Traditionally the main economical source of Castellar del Vall√®s has been agriculture. It is based on typical Mediterranean crops (wine, olives, wheat, dried fruit and nuts) complemented by products of the vegetable garden. Linen and hemp have been grown on the banks of the Ripoll river since the Middle Ages. From the 19th century an unstoppable process of industrialization being profitable exploited the power of the Ripoll river, first manufacturing wool, then cotton and continuing until the 20th century asindustrial development kept on converting agricultural land into built-up areas or industrial estates, leaving agriculture as a residual economical activity. An increasingly important tertiary sector has converted the economy of Castellar into that typical of a post-industrial society. The industrial development of Castellar del Vall√®s has been a lot joined to that of the textile company Tolr√†, for the number of jobs as well as for the contributions of patronage of this family to the seattown. The town counts on two industrial estates in where 5,000 persons (highlighting the companies of the sector metallurgical and of the wood) work. Another important sector is that of the services. Transport The Castellar's Giants called Sol (Sun) and Lluna (Moon) and their daughter Estel (Star) Castellar has two main roads, the C-1415a, which joins the town to Sentmenat and Matadepera, and the B124, which connects Sabadell and Sant Lloren√ß Savall.

(2003) The term is often used interchangeably with secretary or scribe. Origin and secretarial uses A Mexican evangelista, or letter- writer The word originated in ancient Rome, for a slave at his master's personal service \\"within hand's reach\\", performing any command; later it was specifically applied to an intimately trusted servant (often a freedman) acting as a personal secretary (amanuensis is what he does, not what he is).Suetonius In the Bible, the Apostle Paul is shown as the author of the Book of Romans.Romans 1:1 However, at the end of the book, Tertius of Iconium describes himself as the scribe who wrote the letter.Romans 16:22 A similar semantic evolution occurred at the French royal court, where the secr√©taire de la main du roi, originally a lowly clerk specializing in producing, at royal command, the Sovereign's signature on more documents than he cared to put his pen to, developed into the secr√©taires d'√©tat, the first permanent portfolio ministers, to which the British Secretaries of State would be the counterpart. Academic uses It is also used in a specific sense in some academic contexts, for instance when an injured or disabled person is helped by an amanuensis at a written examination. A notable case in classical music was that of Eric Fenby, who assisted the blind composer Frederick Delius in writing down the notes that Delius dictated.Eric Fenby (1936) Delius as I Knew Him, G. Bell & Sons, Ltd., London In the Netherlands it refers to a (technically schooled) physics, chemistry or biology laboratory assistant responsible for preparing and assisting with or conducting laboratory demonstrations and maintaining the instruments. When employed as such in a school environment s/he will have the title of \\"TOA\\" (\\"technisch- onderwijsassistent\\", i.e. Technical Teaching Assistant). In Norway, amanuensis is an academic rank of a lecturer with a doctorate. F√∏rsteamanuensis (Norwegian for \\"first amanuensis\\") is the equivalent of associate professor. In Sweden, amanuens is used to denote roughly a teaching assistant at university who either continues with his own scientific work, or who works as an administrative assistant at the department where he or she studies. The title can also be used for a civil servant at archives or museums. In Finland, amanuenssi is an administrative employee of a university or a research institution. In universities, amanuenses can be involved with student guidance counseling, organising course activities etc. In Finnish universities' schools of medicine, the title of \\"amanuenssi\\" is reserved for students working under guidance and supervision in hospitals, a mandatory part of medical studies. The term is also used to describe one who assists an organist during a performance, by drawing and retiring stops, and by turning pages, although the more common term is \\"registrant.\\" Modern religious uses Amanuensis is also used in New Thought and mystical religious movements -- such as Church Universal and Triumphant -- to describe the role of a person receiving dictation from one of the Ascended Masters. For example, Mark L. Prophet -- religious leader and founder of the Summit Lighthouse (1958) -- claims to have written down the words of AM El Morya (also embodied as Thomas More) as received through dictation. (\\"Dictation\\" is claimed to be a form of direct communication from a non-incarnate Master to a guru or leader with the capacity to receive such messages). In doing so, Prophet would have served as El Morya's amanuensis. Job titles Certain employers use the term for (generally unskilled) manual labourers at the bottom of the hierarchy, for example as factotum. During the 19th and early 20th century, an amanuensis was the job title for male secretaries who were employed by the railroad or ship to be available for travelers who required services en route. The title is also used for officer positions in some collegiate debate and literary societies, including the Philodemic Society of Georgetown University. The Amanuensis records the official proceedings of these societies. A similar term, handlanger, exists in German and Dutch (nowadays in Germany its negative connotation of an unscrupulous, low person acting as criminal assistant prevails whereas the original use of this term for an unskilled and possibly also illiterate person assisting, in the literal sense of lending a hand at construction works has become rather rareHandlanger, der at duden.de). The term, handlanger, is also used in Afrikaans, but mostly without the criminal undertones; handlanger typically refers to an aide, helper or handyman.

The book title is based on \\"One shot, one kill,\\" the military sniper's creed. The novel was adapted into the 2012 film Jack Reacher, starring Tom Cruise as the title character. This book is written in the third person. Plot In a small Indiana city, a lone gunman in a parking garage calmly fires into a rush-hour crowd in a public plaza, committing a massacre of five apparently random victims with six shots. The shooter leaves a perfect trail behind for the police to quickly track him down. Evidence from the scene, of a shell case and a quarter bearing the same fingerprints, points clearly to James Barr, a former Army infantry sniper. He is arrested, but will only say two things to the police: \\"They got the wrong guy,\\" and \\"Get Jack Reacher for me.\\" Reacher, a former Army military police officer and now a drifter, is 1500 miles away, but sees the news on CNN and gets on a bus to Indiana. Reacher has no job, no home, no car, and a shrinking savings account from his past military pay. Although Reacher has a nomadic existence, what he does have is sharp moral clarity. Instead of clearing Barr, Reacher wants to assist the prosecution in convicting him. Reacher is the last person Barr would want to see for good reason. When Reacher was an investigating military policeman years past, Barr had gone on a killing spree similar to the Indiana shootout, murdering four men during the Gulf War in Kuwait City. Convoluted military politics and a technicality let Barr walk free. Reacher swore he would track the sniper down if he ever tried it again. Reacher believes Barr is guilty, but Barr's sister Rosemary is convinced of her brother's innocence and entreats lawyer Helen Rodin to defend her brother. Helen's father is the district attorney who will prosecute the case. When Reacher arrives in Indiana, Barr has been beaten so badly while in prison that he cannot remember anything about the day of the murders, leaving Reacher to form his own conclusions with the available evidence. The local NBC news reporter, Ann Yanni, is also looking for more information, and Reacher is more than willing to include her in his investigation, in exchange for the use of her car and a guaranteed public expos√© on the Barr case. Reacher knows that 35 yards, the parking garage shooting distance to the victims, is point-blank range for a trained military sniper like Barr. Reacher also knows the shooter missed one shot on purpose, giving Reacher one shot at the truth. Reacher drives to Kentucky to the shooting range where the sniper practiced and learns some interesting facts from Gunny Samuel Cash, the former US Marine who owns the shooting range, which make him doubt the solidity of the presumably airtight case against Barr. Cash is unwilling to reveal information or his records to Reacher, but grudgingly agrees to talk if Reacher is able to hit a paper target dead center at 300 yards with one shot. After he succeeds, Reacher is shown 32 sheets of target paper from three years' worth of Barr's practice shootings at his range, every single sheet with dead-on maximum scores. Reacher, given his expertise with firearms and experience as a military investigator, quickly deduces that the target sheets were faked by using a handgun at point blank range. After the visit to the shooting range, Reacher adds Cash's information to the case evidence. Helen and Rosemary sift through the clues in a riveting analysis and finally get Reacher to conclude that Barr is innocent, which means someone set up Barr as the sniper. Someone is also trying to get Reacher off the case, which formerly seemed a slam-dunk, but is now falling apart. Reacher is teamed with Helen, working against a prosecution team that has an explosive secret of its own. Reacher gets closer to the unseen enemy pulling the strings, leading him to the real perpetrators, a Russian gang masquerading as legitimate businessmen. The gang's 80-year-old capo spent much of his life in one of the infamous Soviet gulags and is known only as the Zec (prisoner). Reacher outwits the mob guards in the Russian gang's fortress, efficiently and brutally dispatching five hoods before confronting the boss and forcing him to come clean on the conspiracy from beginning to end: covering up the murder of the one victim he wants dead with the other four victims. The real killer is shot, the Zec chooses to confess to the authorities who arrive on the scene, Barr goes free, and Reacher moves on. Reviews \\"One Shot is pure adrenaline, from its well-constructed setup to its explosive, unforgettable finale.\\" ‚ÄîMiami Herald \\"Elegant, logically constructed mysteries...Mr. Child's idea of heroism has nihilism around the edges but a fierce, fighting spirit at its core. In marked contrast to the brooding figures who otherwise dominate contemporary detective stories, Reacher is not one for self-doubt. His is a two-fisted decency. But Mr. Child also gives him amazing powers of deduction, a serious conscience and the occasional touch of tenderness. It's a wildly improbable mixture, one that can't be beat.\\" ‚ÄîNew York Times \\"Reacher's heroic origins can be traced to the peripatetic knights of King Arthur's Court up through such self-appointed arbiters of justice as Bulldog Drummond, The Saint and James Bond and his brothers in spydom. There's also more than a shade of the great Sherlock in the way he reads people and situations. [T]he character is convincingly all-American, as hard-boiled as Mike Hammer or Sam Spade. [C]ompelling, furiously paced escapist fiction that doesn't stint on deduction, you should definitely follow murder suspect James Barr's example and \\"Get Jack Reacher.\\" ‚ÄîLos Angeles Times Awards and nominations *2006 Macavity Award nominee, Best Mystery Novel *New York Times Bestseller Film adaptation The novel was adapted into the 2012 film Jack Reacher.

His work directing concert tours for pop stars has grossed over two billion dollars. Early career King started his career in entertainment as a dancer. He went on tour with Michael Jackson on his Dangerous World Tour in 1992. Afterward he worked as a director and choreographer in Prince's Glam Slam West nightclub in Los Angeles. While at Glam Slam West, King created a new show every week using songs that Prince was unable to commercially release due to legal obligations to Warner Bros. Records. It was during this time that King learned staging. After seeing a performance by Prince at the American Music Awards of 1995 (that King directed and choreographed), Madonna called King to talk about the two of them working together. The first time they worked together was when he choreographed her 1995 music video \\"Human Nature\\". Fitness ventures In 2004, King teamed up with Nike to create the Nike Rockstar Workout for use in Crunch Fitness gyms across the United States. In 2007, he released his Rock Your Body fitness DVD which sold 100,000 copies. Cirque du Soleil, Super Bowl, and Q'Viva In 2011 King wrote and directed a touring show by Cirque du Soleil dedicated to Michael Jackson called Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour. In 2012, he co-created the boy band IM5 with Perez Hilton and Simon Fuller and directed Madonna's Super Bowl XLVI halftime performance. This performance marked the third time he appeared at Super Bowl for work. His first appearance was in 1993 as a dancer in Michael Jackson's performance at Super Bowl XXVII. He returned in 1996 as a choreographer for Diana Ross' performance at Super Bowl XXX. Also in 2012, he produced the Latin-themed entertainment show Q'Viva! The Chosen with Simon Fuller, Marc Anthony, and Jennifer Lopez. The show was King's first experience working in television rather than stage; however, the singers, instrumentalists, and dancers scouted from the show did give a one-time sold-out performance at the Mandalay Bay Events Center which King also directed. King was the producer for Madonna's 2012 MDNA Tour which marked the first time since Madonna's 2001 Drowned World Tour that he had not been her tour's creative director. In 2013, King directed another Cirque Du Soleil Michael Jackson-themed show called Michael Jackson: One. Unlike the touring show Immortal, Michael Jackson: One is a resident stage show housed at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. Later in the year, King was the creative director for the third season of The X Factor. In 2014, King directed Bruno Mars' Super Bowl XLVIII halftime performance which marked the fourth time he had appeared at Super Bowl for work.

Found originally formed in 1946 to produce a new bush plane design, the FBA-1, but entered production in 1964 with the Found FBA-2. The original company ceased production of the FBA-2 in 1967. In 1994 the company re-formed and starting in 1997 placed the FBA-2 back in production as the FBA-2C1 Bush Hawk and FBA-2C2 Bush Hawk-XP. In 2008, two new and improved models were developed for the private pilot market. Both were built under their Expedition Aircraft brand, launched in 2007. The two models (the E350 and the E350XC) were planned for both tricycle and conventional gear. The E350 was marketed as a Cessna 206 competitor, featuring higher performance, four doors, and STOL performance. The Expedition E350 was FAA type certified in December 2008. Found Aircraft Company ceased trading in early 2014.  History  In 1946, Found Brothers Aviation was established by Nathan Keith (Bud) Found and his brother Sherman \\"Micky\\" Found, to design and build the FBA-1 aircraft. The design was based on experience gained from bush operations north of Edmonton, and down the McKenzie River to the Arctic coast. It was designed to operate on wheels, tundra tires, skis and floats and to withstand the rugged use encountered in the undeveloped regions of Canada‚Äôs bush country. The FBA-1 first flew in 1949 and was used as a proof of concept aircraft.Found Aircraft, A Brief History Design refinements were started in 1950 for the FBA-2. Due to limited funds, progress was slow and this aircraft, with a tricycle landing gear, first flew in 1959. This flight demonstrated the aircraft‚Äôs excellent handling qualities and, as a result, John David Eaton (of Eaton's Department Stores) purchased two aircraft for Georgian Bay Airways in Parry Sound. Mr. Eaton also ended up being the major investor behind the development of the FBA-2C production model. Certification in Canada and the United States was obtained in 1964, with production starting that year. The company had difficulty producing the hand-made aircraft in a profitable manner and production ceased in 1967, after only twenty-seven examples had been produced. During the following thirty years, the FBA-2C developed a legendary reputation as a safe, rugged, reliable, and economical aircraft. Nine FBA-2C's remain flying in Canada today, some having over 13,000 hours of operation. The Centennial 100 was developed as an improved version of the Found FBA-2 in 1966-67. Only five were built. In 1994, Bud Found regained control to the rights of the aircraft. In 1996, these rights were then transferred to Found Aircraft Development. This company, and its wholly owned manufacturing subsidiary, Found Aircraft Canada, were established to develop and produce the FBA-2C1 Bush Hawk, essentially a minor update to the original in order to comply with new regulations. In 1997, Transport Canada reinstated the FBA-2C's type certificate. After two years of redevelopment work to the design, the Bush Hawk was certified in Canada in March 1999 and the United States in March 2000. Found Aircraft's largest customer was the United States Department of the Interior, which uses the aircraft mainly in its U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service division in Alaska. Found aircraft produced and sold the FBA-2C3 E350, which is an evolution of the 2C2 Bush Hawk, with tricycle landing gear, five seats and a Lycoming IO-580 engine producing .

Agriculture is important to the economy in the district, especially in the valley near Jericho, its capital. Jericho is often considered the oldest continuous settlement in the world; its many historic and archaeological sites attract numerous tourists to the area. Elishia's Park (also called Elisee's Spring and Ein el-Sultan) is an oasis in the Jericho District that is home to orchards, palm groves, banana plantations, and other flora.

Early life Welch was born in London; the daughter of a railway engineer. As a child, Ann (Edmonds) kept a diary listing every aeroplane that flew over the house. She first flew with Alan Cobham in 1930. After she had acquired a motorbike to visit the local aerodrome, she learned to fly, earning her pilot's licence in 1934 one month after her seventeenth birthday. From an early age she excelled in drawing and painting, and was a painter of note. Potrait of Ann Welch Pre-war and World War II Welch started gliding in 1937 and attended an Anglo-German Fellowship Camp at the London Gliding Club meeting Wolf Hirth and Hanna Reitsch followed by a return visit to Germany in 1938. She restarted the Surrey Gliding Club in 1938 at Redhill, Surrey becoming their Chief Flying Instructor and achieving a membership of over 100. When the Second World War broke out she enrolled in the Air Transport Auxiliary, ferrying many types of aircraft including Spitfires, Hurricanes, Blenheims and Wellingtons from the factories to their operational units. She stopped this work shortly before the birth of her first daughter. In 1943, Welch (under the name \\"A. C. Douglas\\") published \\"Cloud Reading for Pilots.\\" The book, quite unique at the time, remains an excellent introduction on the use of cloud observations in assessing the state of the atmosphere. Gliding After the war Welch returned to gliding and with Lorne Welch and Walter Morison (two former prisoners at Colditz Castle) restarted the Surrey Gliding Club, eventually moving it in 1951 to Lasham Airfield. She trained many pilots and instructors while bringing up a young family, sometimes shouting instructions to a family member as she flew past in an open-cockpit glider. For twenty years she was in charge of the British Gliding Association's panel of examiners responsible for British instructor standards and training. She was an avid cross-country pilot and became a member of the British team at World Gliding Championships for many years. Flying from Lezno in Poland in 1961, she broke the British women's distance record with 528 km. Her books on aviation are still widely admired and sought after. She flew over 150 types of aircraft. Administration Welch was an active volunteer to the British Gliding Association as vice chairman. She also managed the British Gliding Team for twenty years, and organised competitions including the World Gliding Championships at South Cerney in 1965. Later, she was elected as delegate to the FAI's International Gliding Commission and acted as jury member at several World Gliding Championships. For many years she and Philip Wills administered British gliding until the members felt that a change was needed. Conscious of the increasing cost of gliding and the need to involve young people, she moved away from gliding and became closely involved in the development of hang gliding and paragliding, and was founder President of the FAI's Hang Gliding Commission and its Paragliding Commission, and was a member of the FAI's Microlight Commission. She became president of the British Hang Gliding Association and when in 1991, the hang-gliders and paragliders joined forces, Welch was appointed president of the British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association. In 1978 she was appointed the president of the British Microlight Aircraft Association, a position she held until her death, working actively for the association including attending as a member of their governing council. Awards and honours Welch was awarded the FAI Bronze Medal (1969), the Lilienthal Gliding Medal (1973) and the FAI Gold Air Medal (1980) in recognition of her devotion to the training and encouragement of young pilots. (With the Gold Medal she joined a group that included Yuri Gagarin and Frank Whittle.) In 1989 she was awarded the FAI's Pelagia Majewska Gliding Medal as an outstanding female glider pilot. She was appointed MBE in 1953 and advanced to OBE in 1966. In 1996 she was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Aero Club. Her love of outdoor included sailing and studied the wind and tides. This was ultimately rewarded when in 1997 she was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of Navigation. In 2005 the Ann Welch Award was instituted for outstanding contributions to instruction in air sports. It was first presented in 2006 at Royal Aero Club's Awards Ceremony. Also in 2006, the FAI created the Ann Welch Diploma which may be awarded each year to the pilot or crew of a microlight or paramotor who made the most meritorious flight which resulted in a world record. Annually, usually in late spring since 2006, the Royal Aeronautical Society holds its Ann Welch named lecture in London, typically on a General Aviation theme. Personal life In 1939 Ann (Edmonds) married Graham Douglas whose family owned Redhill Aerodrome and who had loaned the club the ¬£300 needed to buy the necessary gliders and a winch. This marriage was eventually dissolved and five years later she married Lorne Welch in 1953. Lorne Welch predeceased her but she was survived by her three daughters.

It was published in 2007, and written in the third person. The title is derived from the song lyrics by singer Albert King \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\". Plot summary A man with two broken legs is thrown out of a corporate helicopter from 3,000 feet above the California desert. Seventeen days after that, Reacher is roaming alone with no objectives, no phone, no address, just the clothes he's wearing and his ATM card, when he sees an anonymous deposit to his bank account. Reacher automatically analyses the amount, using his math obsession and investigative skills. Also obsessed with math, Frances Neagley (previously seen in Without Fail) is the sender of $1,030.00, which Reacher recognizes as their old army code, 10‚Äì30, for urgent help needed. He meets up with Neagley in California and they discover the death of Calvin Franz, one of nine members of their elite team of ex‚Äìarmy investigators, who are being hunted down one by one. After getting no reply from anyone else, their suspicions rise and Neagley convinces him to put the old unit back together. Reacher and Neagley find that three of the other five members are missing, while Stan Lowery had a fatal car accident years earlier. They conclude Franz called the others for help with a major problem but left out the remaining four that resided too far away to get to him quickly, apart from Reacher, who is famously untraceable. Reacher and Neagley visit Franz's widow and child, Angela and Charlie. Angela is not surprised to see them and says that Franz told her all about the team, which made her feel like he had been married before, to them. Reacher notes if people were lucky like the team, they became family, but Franz got even luckier with her and Charlie, with Angela replying \\"but his luck ran out\\". The visit produces no useful information about Franz's death, but Angela gives them Franz's office keys, which Reacher and Neagley find gutted and trashed. They realise the perpetrators didn't find what they were looking for and that Franz kept his home life completely separate from his business, leading Franz to mail any dangerous computer data to himself, with triple backup of refreshed computer USB flash drives on rotating days. They find his flash memory sticks in his business post-office box and try unsuccessfully to crack the password. More information on the other team members shows that Franz was unlikely to be the one who called for help. Reacher and Neagley go to Tony Swan's workplace, defense contractor New Age in search of information, but are sent away with basically nothing by the HR manager, Margaret Berenson, except that Swan had been unemployed by them three weeks prior. They meet David O'Donnell at their hotel, confirming three of the team are alive. O'Donnell cracks the password to Franz's flash drives and the team reviews a set of bizarre numbers which they conclude to be scores, and an unfamiliar name \\"Adrian Mount\\" with four aliases. The trio then go to Swan's home for more clues. Following Reacher and his team is an unmarked car, which they trap to discourage the driver. After roughing him up they find out the driver is an LA County Deputy named Thomas Brant, but outside of his jurisdiction in Orange County, CA. The team decides to ditch their rental car for a new one and run into Karla Dixon. With four of the team now confirmed alive, they proceed to source money, cars and weapons. Except for Reacher, all the team members have \\"moved onward and upward\\" from the military, making Reacher reconsider his drifting. He is happy for the others' successes but feels as if he is \\"treading water while the rest are swimming\\". Putting aside conflicting reactions at seeing his team again, Reacher on the three missing members; Manuel Orozco, Jorge Sanchez and Tony Swan, and which one was in a situation so bad they couldn't handle it on their own and called for help. Unsurprised, Reacher is visited by Brant and his boss, Curtis Mauney, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department detective. But Reacher is surprised when Mauney tells him that Reacher and his team are bait, for whoever killed Franz and caused Swan, Sanchez and Orozco to be reported missing. Mauney's LA deputies and Las Vegas police frequently work together and recent information had linked the dead and the missing with Reacher's team. Neagley gets a response regarding Swan's company New Age from Diana Bond, a staffer for a guy on the House Defense Committee, that Reacher and his team distrust, but they pressure Diana for confidential information on New Age and its military contracts. Mauney later contacts the team with information on Jorge Sanchez's death and Vegas police evidence on Adrian Mount with three aliases, one less than Franz had. Sanchez and Orozco were partners in a Las Vegas casino security firm, and the team drives to Las Vegas for clues and answers on Sanchez and the still missing Orozco. Reacher and his team seek out the major casino security directors about the possibility of Sanchez and Orozco being involved in a large scale internal multi-casino thief network and are told about Sanchez's girlfriend, who leads them to Orozco's wife and children. An assassination attempt is made on Reacher and his team but they kill the assassin and take his car, which Reacher recalls from their LA hotel. Reacher uses the cell phone in the car to return-dial the last number on the call list, telling the man who answers that his assassin failed, the team knows he is behind their unit's dead members and they are coming for him. From Las Vegas they are told to meet Mauney at the hospital, leading Reacher to conclude that Sanchez is not dead, just severely injured. O'Donnell and Dixon go to the hospital and Reacher and Neagley go to find Margaret Berenson, after they realise that she has been lying to them. They find that New Age has been producing state of the art surface to air missiles and pretending to destroy the prototypes, while selling them to foreign terrorists. Neagley and Reacher leave Berenson's house after finding out Berenson is being blackmailed by New Age's corrupt director, Allen Lamaison, who has threatened to harm her son if she reveals what she knows. Upon discovering this, Reacher and Neagley arrange a safe hiding place for them. After investigating Lamaison, they also discover that Lamaison used to be a police officer before joining New Age, and his partner was none other than Curtis Mauney. From this, Reacher and Neagley deduce that Lamaison and Mauney are working together. O'Donnell and Dixon are captured by Mauney's men in the hospital and taken to New Age's Director, Allen Lamaison. Reacher and Neagley track Mauney down, take his suitcase containing the terrorists' payment of $65 million, and kill him. At the second New Age complex, Reacher stows away on the same helicopter as Lamaison, where he finds O'Donnell and Dixon tied up and about to be thrown off and killed the same way that Franz, Orozco, Sanchez and Swan were. Reacher confronts Lamaison just in time, kills his assistant and pushes Lamaison out of the helicopter once it is fully one mile above ground level. After the helicopter lands Reacher asks the pilot if he flew for each of the murders and after confirmation, Reacher kills the pilot as well. The last part is the terrorist weapons buyer, who Reacher concludes does not know how to use them. The team finds the one New Age staff engineer capable of teaching the terrorist how to use the weapons, and who is being threatened with his daughter's torture. Reacher poses as the engineer briefly as the terrorist arrives, then he and Neagley tie the terrorist up, leaving him for FBI to find. Later, the four team members agree to set up trust funds for the murdered team members' loved ones, with a donation to PETA for Tony Swan's only family, his dog Maisi, and split the remaining money obtained from the bad guys. After going their separate ways, Reacher receives a deposit for over $100,000 in his account, automatically analyses it, and thinks the amount is just a boring plain number. He feels disappointed and let down by Dixon, the money manager of the group. But the detailed report shows multiple deposits, \\"101810.18. 10012 ... Military police radio code for mission accomplished, twice over. 10‚Äì18, 10‚Äì18 ... second deposit was her zip code: 10012. Greenwich Village. Where she lived.\\" Reacher remembers her inviting him to visit her in New York, and considers a moment, but remembering his words to her that he \\"Doesn't make plans\\", withdraws a $100 and buys a ticket on the first bus available, with no idea where it is going.

He then thought about old colleagues, workmates, buddies, that he went through a lot with, and wondered where they all were, what were they doing, were they doing well or struggling, were they happy, what did they look like, and leading to full nostalgia: feelings that high school, college, old jobs, old towns moved away from, that everyone shares. He decided to make the next Reacher book about a reunion, \\"among a bunch of old colleagues that he hadn't seen for ten years, people that he loved fiercely and respected deeply. Regular Reacher readers will know that he's a pretty self-confident guy, but I wanted him to wobble just a little this time, to compare his choices with theirs, to measure himself against them.\\" When Reacher's old friend tells him in the novel's beginning to \\"put the old unit back together\\", Child notes, \\"It's an irresistible invitation.

It is considered by public safety authorities, medical practice, and emergency services to be a medical emergency, requiring immediate suicide intervention and emergency medical treatment. Suicidal presentations occur when there is an emotional problem or predicament that the individual cannot solve and suicide is a solution to them. Clinicians should re-frame suicidal crises, point out that suicide is not a solution and help the individual identify and solve or tolerate the problems.  Nature Most cases of potential suicide have warning signs.thethreeseas.com.auhealth.umd.edu/node/791 Attempting to kill oneself, talking about or planning suicide, writing a suicide note, talking or thinking frequently about death, exhibiting a death wish by expressing it verbally or by taking potentially deadly risks, or taking steps towards attempting suicide (e.g., obtaining rope and tying it to a ligature point to attempt a hanging or stockpiling pills for an attempted overdose) are all indicators of a suicide crisis. More subtle clues include preparing for death for no apparent reason (such as putting affairs in order, changing a will, etc.), writing goodbye letters, and visiting or calling family members or friends to say farewell. The person may also start giving away previously valued items (because they \\"no longer need them\\"). In other cases, the person who seemed depressed and suicidal may become normal or filled with energy or calmness again; these people particularly need to be watched because the return to normalcy could be because they have come to terms with whatever act is next (e.g., a plan to attempt suicide and \\"escape\\" from their problems). Depression is a major causative factor of suicide, and individuals suffering from depression are considered a high-risk group for suicidal behavior. However, suicidal behaviour is not just restricted to patients diagnosed with some form of depression.Barker, P. (2003). Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing The craft of caring. pp 227. New York, NY: Oxford University Press Inc. More than 90% of all suicides are related to a mood disorder, such as bipolar disorder, Depression, or other psychiatric illnesses, such as schizophrenia. The deeper the depression, the greater the risk, often manifested in feelings or expressions of apathy, helplessness, hopelessness, or worthlessness. Suicide is often committed in response to a cause of depression, such as the cessation of a romantic relationship, serious illness or injury (like the loss of a limb or blindness), the death of a loved one, financial problems or poverty, guilt or fear of getting caught for something the person did, drug abuse, old age, concerns with gender identity, among others. In 2006, WHO conducted a study on suicide around the world. The results in Canada showed that 80-90% of attempts failed (an estimation, due to the complications of predicting attempted suicide). 90% of failed suicides investigated led to hospitalizations. 12% of attempts were in hospitals. Treatments Crisis hotlines, such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, enable people to get immediate emergency telephone counselling Ketamine has been tested for treatment-resistant bipolar depression, major depressive disorder, and people in a suicidal crisis in emergency rooms, and is being used this way off-label. The drug is given by a single intravenous infusion at doses less than those used in anesthesia, and preliminary data have indicated it produces a rapid (within 2 hours) and relatively sustained (about 1‚Äì2 weeks long) significant reduction in symptoms in some patients.ECRI Institute, under contract to AHRQ. December 2013 AHRQ Healthcare Horizon Scanning System ‚Äì Potential High-Impact Interventions Report. Priority Area 05: Depression and Other Mental Health Disorders Initial studies with ketamine have sparked scientific and clinical interest due to its rapid onset, and because it appears to work by blocking NMDA receptors for glutamate, a different mechanism from most modern antidepressants that operate on other targets. Some studies have shown that lithium medication can reduce suicidal ideation within 48 hours of administration.

It was published in 1999 by Putnam in America and Bantam in the United Kingdom. It is written in the third person. In the novel, retired military police officer Jack Reacher becomes embroiled in a mystery involving a Vietnam War veteran who was reported missing in action, but who has resurfaced as a vicious loanshark with a secret he will murder to protect. Plot summary The prologue describes Victor Truman \\"Hook\\" Hobie's carefully planned escape route in the event of somebody discovering his \\"really big, well-guarded secret\\". His \\"early-warning system\\" consists of geographically-located \\"tripwires\\" that will warn him that he has been discovered. The first is eleven thousand miles from his home in the United States and the second is six thousand miles out. His response to their activation would be to tie up loose ends, cash in, transfer his assets, and flee the country. Over thirty years of quiet success have made him feel somewhat secure. But he did not expect both alerts to arrive on the same day. The story then begins with Jack Reacher working two jobs in Key West (digging pools with a shovel by day and working in a bar at night) and bumping into a private investigator, Costello, who happens to be looking for him on behalf of a client named Mrs. Jacob, a name Reacher does not recognise. Later on, while Reacher is working his night job as a bouncer in a strip club, two suspicious-looking large men also make inquiries about his location. Reacher attempts to follow them but instead finds Costello murdered on the sidewalk. Jack then flies to New York to find out why Costello was looking for him and why he was killed for it. After finding Costello's office ransacked, Reacher gets the contact information for Mrs. Jacob and arrives in the middle of a funeral for his old mentor, former commanding officer, and friend, Col. Leon Garber. Garber's now-adult daughter, Jodie Garber-Jacob, turns out to be the mystery client. She has become a successful lawyer. Reacher and Jodie follow Costello's trail, uncovering information on her father's last project, an investigation for the Hobie family on the whereabouts of their son Victor, a helicopter pilot reported missing-in-action decades ago in Vietnam. They discover that the Hobies had been tricked into giving their life savings to a con man and gun runner named Rutter, who poses as a fake military liaison and investigator to families of MIA soldiers. Hobie becomes aware of their investigation, and tries to hunt them down. After forcing Rutter to return the money he stole, Reacher and Jodie visit the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, which leads them to the military Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii, a special facility that identifies the forensic remains of soldiers. They then learn that Hobie served in the war as a helicopter pilot until he was shot down. However, it becomes clear that Hobie died in the crash, and that another soldier named Carl Allen assumed his identity in order to escape prosecution for fragging a superior officer. Severely burned by the crash, Allen left his own dogtags behind to fool investigators and had his right hand, lost in the helicopter crash, replaced with a hook. Under his new identity, Allen amasses a fortune as an illicit \\"moneylender\\", before establishing himself as a legitimate businessman who offers high-interest loans to financially troubled firms unable to borrow from banks. However, his real objective is to seize control of their assets, using threats and torture to force his clients to agree to his terms. Despite being aware that Reacher's investigation could expose his crimes, Allen decides to complete one final job: the takeover of a bankrupt multimillion-dollar company owned by Chester and Marilyn Stone. Allen and his men take the couple hostage, but Marilyn is able to stall them before her husband signs over his company. Jodie is called back to New York by her law firm to handle the Stone deal, but ends up being captured by Allen along with another private investigator posing as the Stone's lawyer, forcing Reacher to come to her rescue. Reacher manages to kill Allen and his men, but sustains a seemingly fatal bullet wound to his chest. At the hospital, however, a doctor discovers that, due to the arduous physical labour he has done digging pools in Key West, his pectoral muscle was so thick the bullet did not make it past his rib cage. Reacher is then visited (while convalescing) by the Hobie family to thank him for restoring their son's good name.  Continuation The bullet wound that Reacher received is mentioned a few times in other Lee Child novels. Most of the women that Reacher sleeps with notice the \\"crater\\" and usually place their pinkie there while asking how it happened. In One Shot Reacher sums up the story by saying it was a wound received by a \\"Mad Man\\" and that most women are curious about it except for the one whom he was saving at the time. Production Lee Child began writing Tripwire in spring 1997. The book was published on 15 June 1999 in the United Kingdom and the American publication followed on 28 June of the same year. The reasoning for the opening of the book taking place in Key West was a vacation Child spent there in 1996. The provisional title for Tripwire was The Hook, but that name was scrapped as Putnam believed the title was not \\"punchy\\" enough. Putnam also believed The Hook would remind people too much of Peter Pan.

History  With the Restoration and additional tourism traffic generated by Colonial Williamsburg beginning in the late 1920s, Merrimack Trail was built in the early 1930s to supplement U.S. Route 60 as part the State Route 168 project which extended all the way east to North Carolina. The Merrimack Trail portion of VA-168 extended on the Virginia Peninsula from Anderson Corner near Toano to a crossing of Hampton Roads to South Hampton Roads by ferry, prior to the opening of the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel on November 1, 1957. The ferry, which connected to Norfolk at the end of 99th Street at Pine Beach, charged a toll of automobile and driver, $1 and $1.25 for each additional passenger. The name originated because the road lead to a ferry landing in Newport News was located near the historic location of the Battle of Hampton Roads between the ironclad warships in March 1862 during the American Civil War. The Confederate ironclad C.S.S. Virginia had been built from the hull of the U.S.S. Merrimack, partially burned by Union troops evacuating the Norfolk Naval Shipyard the previous year.

Geography The source of the river is located in the Serra de Granera, at of elevation, and it discharges in Montcada i Reixac, at . It has a length of , with a total of , once its tributaries are included.Source of information: the City council of Sabadell's website: , It covers the vast majority of the comarca of Vall√®s Occidental, passing through the municipalities of Sant Lloren√ß Savall, Castellar del Vall√®s, Sabadell, Barber√† del Vall√®s, Ripollet and Montcada i Reixac. Throughout the comarca, it crosses alluvial clay terrains, which erodes easily, causing the river to carve a deep path into the soil. History Throughout its history, the river was used by the inhabitants of the surrounding area for irrigation. Irrigation has been in place from at least the mid-10th century, when priests of Sant Lloren√ß built an irrigation system that is still used to work the orchards along the riverside and mills to produce flour. As modernization also reached the area, most of the mills were reconverted to produce paper. However, by the 18th century, the production of paper had ceased to be a dominant industry along the river. During the 19th century, the mills of the riverside were reconverted again, this time into textile factories, which lasted until the late 20th century. Due to the dyes and chemicals used in the textile industry, the water of the river became heavily polluted. More recently, because of the Catalan textile crisis, most of the factories were abandoned or reconverted for other uses, lessening the strain on the river's water quality. Recently, there have been initiatives to recover the Ripoll for community recreation,such as a project initiated by the Sabadell City Council to build the Parc Fluvial del Ripoll (River Park of the Ripoll): by restoring the river, which had deteriorated due not only to industrial pollution but also to the shanty towns made by immigrants who came to work in the mills from Southern Spain during the 1960s. 1962 disaster The Ripoll in Sabadell during a flood, very common in spring, when the Mediterranean climate suffers torrential rains.

It was once considered the third most important in the city after the Duomo and the Basilica di Sant'Ambrogio. It is dedicated to saint Babylas of Antioch. History and Description At the beginning of the 5th century, Marolus, the bishop of Milan, brought from Antioch to Milan relics of saints Babylas of Antioch and Romanus of Caesarea. Marolus founded the Basilica Concilia Sanctorum or church of San Romano, which stood until the 19th century, a few meters south of the church of San Babila, on the site of a Roman temple dedicated to the Sun. The church of San Babila was built on the same site in about 1095. In the 16th century, the church was extended with an additional construction at the front and a new baroque fa√ßade. The church still retains its original medieval fabric, although much was lost due to baroque and modern renovations. The whole complex was renovated in the 19th century with the intent of restoring the appearance of the medieval basilica, and in the early 20th century, Paolo Cesa Bianchi designed the Neo-Romanesque fa√ßade that we now see. Previous to 1927, the church had a Mannerist facade with pilasters and a protruding portal with columns and a roofline surmounted by spherical pinnacles with palm-leaves above. The bell tower is from 1920, and replaced the original tower which fell down in the 16th century. The column in front of the church dates to the 18th-century and has a lion atop, a symbol of the neighborhood. The interior has a nave and two aisles; it ends in typical multilobular semicircular Romanesque apses. There are two side chapels that date from the late Renaissance. The right aisle has an image of the Madonna which is highly venerated by the Milanese population.

Dr. George Lane developed this indicator in the late 1950s. The term stochastic refers to the point of a current price in relation to its price range over a period of time.Murphy, John J. (1999). \\"John Murphy's Ten Laws of Technical Trading \\". This method attempts to predict price turning points by comparing the closing price of a security to its price range. The 5-period stochastic oscillator in a daily timeframe is defined as follows: :\\\\%K = 100*(Price-L5)/(H5-L5) :\\\\%D_N = ((K1+K2+K3)/N) where H5 and L5 are the highest and lowest prices in the last 5 days respectively, while %D is the N-day moving average of %K (the last N values of %K). Usually this is a simple moving average, but can be an exponential moving average for a less standardized weighting for more recent values. There is only one valid signal in working with %D alone ‚Äî a divergence between %D and the analyzed security.Lane, George M.D. (May/June 1984) ‚ÄúLane‚Äôs Stochastics,‚Äù second issue of Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities magazine. pp 87-90.  Definition  The calculation above finds the range between an asset‚Äôs high and low price during a given period of time. The current security's price is then expressed as a percentage of this range with 0% indicating the bottom of the range and 100% indicating the upper limits of the range over the time period covered. The idea behind this indicator is that prices tend to close near the extremes of the recent range before turning points. The Stochastic oscillator is calculated: ::Where :::Price is the last closing price :::LOW_N(Price) is the lowest price over the last N periods :::HIGH_N(Price) is the highest price over the last N periods :::\\\\%D is a 3-period simple moving average of %K, SMA_3(\\\\%K). :::\\\\%D-Slow is a 3-period simple moving average of %D, SMA_3(\\\\%D). A 3-line Stochastics will give an anticipatory signal in %K, a signal in the turnaround of %D at or before a bottom, and a confirmation of the turnaround in %D-Slow.Lane, George C. & Caire (1998) \\"Getting Started With Stochastics\\" pg 3 Typical values for N are 5, 9, or 14 periods. Smoothing the indicator over 3 periods is standard. Dr. George Lane, a financial analyst, is one of the first to publish on the use of stochastic oscillators to forecast prices. According to Lane, the Stochastics indicator is to be used with cycles, Elliott Wave Theory and Fibonacci retracement for timing. In low margin, calendar futures spreads, one might use Wilders parabolic as a trailing stop after a stochastics entry. A centerpiece of his teaching is the divergence and convergence of trendlines drawn on stochastics, as diverging/converging to trendlines drawn on price cycles. Stochastics predicts tops and bottoms.  Interpretation  The signal to act is when there is a divergence-convergence, in an extreme area, with a crossover on the right hand side, of a cycle bottom. As plain crossovers can occur frequently, one typically waits for crossovers occurring together with an extreme pullback, after a peak or trough in the %D line. If price volatility is high, an exponential moving average of the %D indicator may be taken, which tends to smooth out rapid fluctuations in price. Stochastics attempts to predict turning points by comparing the closing price of a security to its price range. Prices tend to close near the extremes of the recent range just before turning points. In the case of an uptrend, prices tend to make higher highs, and the settlement price usually tends to be in the upper end of that time period's trading range. When the momentum starts to slow, the settlement prices will start to retreat from the upper boundaries of the range, causing the stochastic indicator to turn down at or before the final price high. Stochastic divergence. An alert or set-up is present when the %D line is in an extreme area and diverging from the price action. The actual signal takes place when the faster % K line crosses the % D line. Divergence-convergence is an indication that the momentum in the market is waning and a reversal may be in the making. The chart below illustrates an example of where a divergence in stochastics, relative to price, forecasts a reversal in the price's direction. An event known as \\"stochastic pop\\" occurs when prices break out and keep going. This is interpreted as a signal to increase the current position, or liquidate if the direction is against the current position.

Akpoborie also had spells with FC Carl Zeiss Jena, Stuttgart Kickers, for whom he scored 37 goals in one season, and Waldhof Mannheim, before finally joining top-flight F.C. Hansa Rostock in 1995. After spending two years at Hansa, the player moved to their Bundesliga rivals VfB Stuttgart and then VfL Wolfsburg in 1999. Akpoborie finished his playing career at Saarbr√ºcken in 2002.  International career  Akpoborie was part of the Nigeria team that won the first edition of the FIFA U-16 Championship in 1985, scoring in the final against the then West Germany. Two years later, he featured for the Flying Eagles at the 1987 FIFA World Youth Championship in Chile. He attended and played for Brooklyn College. At the senior level, he was selected for the 1992 and 2000 Africa Cup of Nations where he won bronze and silver respectively. His first senior cap was in a 1992 Africa Cup of Nations Third-place match against Cameroon, which the Super Eagles won. He scored his first goal for the Super Eagles against Mexico at the 1995 U.S. Cup on 24 June 1995. He got his second goal ‚Äì a 48th-minute equalizer ‚Äì in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Kenya in a 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification match on 12 January 1997. Akpoborie was surprisingly dropped from Nigeria's squad for 1998 FIFA World Cup by Bora Milutinoviƒá, in spite of the fact that he played in five of the six 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification matches and was the joint second top scorer in the 1997-98 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup tournament. He was also one of the two Nigerian footballers to play in a European Cup final that year, the other being Inter Milan defender Taribo West, who was red-carded in the 1998 UEFA Cup Final, less than a month to the World Cup in France. In 1999, Dutch manager Thijs Libregts recalled him to the national side in a 2000 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier against Senegal. The game ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw, with Akpoborie scoring his third international goal. Nigeria did not play any qualifier after the game as they qualified as hosts of the 2000 AFCON after Zimbabwe ‚Äì the originally designated host ‚Äì failed to get a guarantee from the government. Akpoborie featured in a number of games ahead of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. In the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification ‚Äì CAF First Round, he scored his fourth goal in Nigeria's 4‚Äì0 win over Eritrea in Lagos.  Slave ship allegations  In 2001, Akpoborie made the headlines when a boat, managed by his family, was stopped in Benin after allegations that it was carrying children into slavery in Gabon. The incident led to Akpoborie's suspension from the Wolfsburg team and eventually, after a brief sojourn at Saarbr√ºcken, to his retirement. The story of the ship, her passengers and her owner has been covered by the documentary Das Schiff des Torj√§gers (The Goalgetter's Ship) by Swiss director Heidi Specogna.

LDS poetry (or Mormon poetry) is poetry written by members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints about spiritual topics or themes. Latter-day Saints have composed religious poetry since the Church's beginnings in the early 19th century. For Latter-day Saints, poetry is a form of art that can bring the Holy Spirit to the presented message. For example, the Elder's Journal, published at Far West in 1838 and edited by Joseph and Don Carlos Smith, contained a beautiful poetic tribute to James G. Marsh.ELDERS' JOURNAL OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER DAY SAINTS. Vol. I. No. 3.] Far West, Missouri, July, 1838. Whole No. 3. Poetry was often used in hymns in the foundation period of LDS Literature (1830‚Äì1880). Notable poetry includes the works of Eliza R. Snow, Parley P. Pratt, and W. W. Phelps, along with the published volume of poetry by John Lyon, The Harp of Zion: A Collection of Poems, Etc. (1853). During the \\"home literature\\" period (1880‚Äì1930), a number of poets published or disseminated their works. Poets Josephine Spencer and Augusta Joyce Crocheron published didactic and narrative poems. Charles Walker's Southern Utah folk poetry became popular, and Orson F. Whitney published hymns, lyric poetry, and a book-length poem, Elias, an Epic of the Ages (1904). Another shift in LDS poetry occurred in the 1960s, starting with Clinton F. Larson's poetry. Larson managed to depart both from the \\"didactic and inward-looking provinciality\\" of early poetry and the \\"elitist, patronizing provinciality\\" of his contemporaries in the lost generation (1930‚Äì1970). In the 1950s, he started writing modernist poetry that drew on his Mormon faith. In his review of Larson's poetry collection, Karl Keller wrote that Lason's poetry showed \\"religion succeeding in an esthetic way.\\" The development of this new movement was aided by the development of the first Mormon academic and literary periodicals, including BYU Studies (1959) and Dialogue (1966). Larson founded BYU Studies in 1959, and contributed poetry there and to Dialogue. More recently, poetry has been seen in General Conference talks given by Apostles of the church. For example, in 1972 as part of his address, Elder Bruce R. McConkie read his poem, \\"I Believe In Christ,\\" which later became a much-loved LDS hymn.Bruce R. McConkie, ‚ÄúThe Testimony of Jesus,‚Äù Ensign, Jul 1972, 109 Many years later, Elder Boyd K. Packer shared his faith about the cleansing power of Jesus in his poem \\"Washed Clean\\" as part of his April Conference talk.Boyd K. Packer, ‚ÄúWashed Clean,‚Äù Ensign, May 1997, 9 While those examples are of personally composed pieces, poetry from many authors is often used in General Conference messages. The former President of the Church, Thomas S. Monson, is an avid lover of poetry and has often referenced it in his own talks. Harvest: Contemporary Mormon Poems (1989), edited by Eugene England and Dennis Clark, and Fire in the Pasture: 21st Century Mormon Poets (2011), edited by Tyler Chadwick, are the preeminent collections of contemporary Mormon poetry.\\"Fire in the Pasture: Gleaning After the Harvest\\" by Michael R.

Since many titles are merely the first lines of the texts used, in different sources individual pieces may be referred to by slightly different titles. For example, R20 is known both as \\"Douce dame\\" and \\"Douce dame tant qui vivray\\". Furthermore, some of Machaut's works (most notably the motets) employ simultaneous performance of several different texts. In such cases, the title of the work lists all texts used, starting from the top voice. Machaut was the first composer to concentrate on self-anthologization of his works, supervising the creation of three complete-works manuscripts during his life. In the last manuscript, written c. 1370, the scribe wrote \\"Vesci l'ordinance que G. de Machau wet qu'il ait en son livre\\"‚Äî\\"Here is the order that G. de Machaut wants his book to have.\\"Lawrence Earp, \\"Machaut's Role in the Production of Manuscripts of His Works,\\" Journal of the American Musicological Society 42:3 (Fall 1989), 461.

Thus, occasionally Le Rem√®de de Fortune works are given their own category and catalogued according to the order of their appearance: * RF1 \\"Qui n'aroit autre deport\\" (Lai) * RF2 \\"Tels rit au main\\" (Complainte) * RF3 \\"Joie, plaisence\\" (Chanson Royale) * RF4 \\"En amer a douce vie\\" (Balladele) * RF5 \\"Dame, de qui toute ma joie\\" (Ballade) * RF6 \\"Dame, a vous sans retoller\\" (Chanson Balad√©e) * RF7 \\"Dame, mon cuer\\" (Rondeau) NotesReferences Machaut, Guillaume de ","title":"List of compositions by Guillaume de Machaut"},{"id":"9649483","text":"Baltimore Hotel may refer to: *Baltimore Hotel (Muskogee, Oklahoma), U.S. *Lord Baltimore Hotel, Baltimore, Maryland, U.S. ","title":"Baltimore Hotel"},{"id":"9649521","text":"\\"Keep Each Other Warm\\" is a 1986 single by Bucks Fizz.

It is privately owned by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou. Through its wholly owned subsidiary EasyGroup IP Licensing Ltd, the company licences the Easy brand to other businesses. From 2012 to 2017, Easygroup also licensed the Fastjet brand to the low-cost African airline. The company was established to expand the \\"easy\\" brand following the successful launch of EasyJet in 1995. The first use of \\"easy\\" after EasyJet was to EasyInternetcaf√© established in June 1999. This was followed in 2000 with the establishment of EasyRentacar, later renamed EasyCar. The group is registered in the Cayman Islands, but operates from its office in Kensington, London.  EasyGroup brand values  EasyGroup publishes brand guidelines for all Easy companies to follow, together with the company's brand values: # Great value # Taking on the big boys # For the many not the few # Relentless innovation # Keep it simple, # Entrepreneurial # Making a difference in people's lives # Honest, open, caring and fun  Easy family of brands =EasyJet EasyJet is a low-cost airline which began flying on 10 November 1995. It is one of the two largest budget airlines in Europe, alongside its rival Ryanair. It was the first company owned by EasyGroup to use the \\"easy\\" prefix. EasyJet Airline Company Limited is a separate company which licenses the \\"easyJet\\" name from easyGroup. Fastjet Fastjet is a low-cost airline group established in 2012 that operates in Africa, originally following a similar business model to EasyJet. It was the first non-Easy brand-name licensed by EasyGroup. Fastjet plc acquired ownership of their brand in late 2017.  EasyCar  In April 2000 the company set-up the car rental company easyRentaCar (later renamed easyCar), with the only rental car available being the Mercedes-Benz A-Class. The new easyCar company now operates as an international car rental broker via the Internet. easyCar Club was launched by easyCar in February 2014 as a peer- to-peer rental scheme that allows members to rent under-used private cars from one another. On 1 December 2018, EasyCar Club stopped accepting bookings citing a problem reaching an agreement with an insurer. On 18 December 2018, EasyCar Club informed members that it was ceasing operations to join forces with Turo, and offering incentives for EasyCar Club members to join Turo.  EasyBus  Box office for the Easyjet shuttle bus to London City at London Stansted Airport EasyBus began operating on 30 July 2004. The company currently offers a low-cost express minibus service between Central London and three London airports: Gatwick, Stansted and Luton. Also between Manchester and Liverpool Airports to Chester, Wrexham, Oswestry and Shrewsbury (Until 9 September) Journeys can be booked via the EasyBus website, or customers can purchase, usually at higher prices, from the EasyBus airport sales desks, or by paying the driver if joining in London. Online bookings offer guaranteed seats on specific services.  EasyPizza  A delivery-only pizza company launched in 2004. EasyPizza ceased to operate their independent franchised stores in December 2009, and teamed up with Just Eat, who operate as a third party to local pizza takeaway and delivery companies.  EasyHotel  Typical EasyHotel room EasyHotel is a \\"no frills super budget\\" hotel operator which started with one hotel in 2005, and now has 20 hotels in various locations in London (Victoria, Old St, South Kensington, Paddington and Heathrow) as well as Luton, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Basel, Zurich, Budapest, Sofia, Porto, Berlin, Larnaca, Dubai, Edinburgh, Budapest, The Hague and Glasgow.

Toiletries (except soap/shampoo) are not supplied and the use of the TV and the housekeeping facility is additional. Reservations must be made online, with the less expensive stays given the further in advance of booking. EasyOffice EasyOffice was established by EasyGroup in 2007, and runs low-cost serviced office space in Croydon. EasyProperty EasyProperty was launched by EasyGroup in 2014, and offers low cost letting agency services to landlords across England and Wales. Property owners can list their properties for free on easyProperty, and access the major property portals, Rightmove, Zoopla, Primelocation etc. for a small charge.

EasyGym  EasyGym, North End Road, Fulham, London EasyGroup announced the launch of a chain of no frill gyms called EasyGym in May 2011, with the first two branches in Slough and Wood Green. EasyFoodstore  EasyFoodstore is a new concept of discount supermarket, which has no brands, and only about 100 items such as tinned goods, pasta and rice and cleaning products. First announced in 2013, opened in London in February 2016, located next to easyBus House (the headquarters of easyBus Ltd). The supermarket charged just 25p for essential food items. Just days after opening its doors it was forced to shut temporarily after running out of stock. The store now sells items at 50p each, with 25p returning during promotional periods only.  Other businesses  * Easy.com ‚Äì A free e-mail service began in November 2000. This site also acts as the easyGroup main portal. * EasyVan ‚Äì Like EasyCar, EasyVan.com operates with outside suppliers to provide van rental across the UK. EasyVan provide van hire from more than 120 locations throughout the United Kingdom. * EasyCoffee - Cheap coffee shop branch based in Burnley, London, Blackburn, Hastings and Edinburgh. EasyInternetcaf√© Launched in 1999 as easyEverything, the EasyInternetcaf√© chain was launched in 1998 to offer access to the internet on the high street. The flagship branch in London's Oxford Street was closed in 2004, and the chain closed in 2009. The business lost 96 million in its first five years of operation.  EasyValue EasyValue was an internet shopping comparison site that began trading in November 2000. In 2002 EasyValue was challenged by Ryanair for displaying its flights without their permission.  EasyMoney  On 21 August 2001 the credit card company EasyMoney was set up with Accucard (now part of Lloyds Bank), which was expanded on 14 February 2005 with the announcement that unbundled car insurance products provided by Zurich would be sold later in the year at EasyMoney insurance. In April 2006, EasyGroup linked with Moneysupermarket.com to provide a financial product comparison website. This coincided with the withdrawal of the EasyMoney credit card. In February 2018, easyMoney relaunched under new ownership as a peer-to- peer lending company providing savers with an option to earn higher interest than the high street banks by lending their money to property professionals. This followed the UK government's move in April 2016 to allow peer-to-peer lending products to be held in a new tax-free Individual Savings Account (ISA) wrapper called an \\"Innovative Finance ISA\\".  EasyCinema  On 23 May 2003 the cinema company, EasyCinema at The Point, Milton Keynes was opened at a former UCI site, offering screenings from 20p if booked well in advance. The cinema initially struggled as major distributors were not prepared to release new films to the company using the yield-management model. First run films later became available, but at fixed prices. The cinema also relented on not serving popcorn and drinks, which previously went unsold to save on staffing costs. Towards the end of its life, the cinema site also housed an EasyInternetcaf√© and was a pick-up point for EasyPizza. However, following a dispute over unpaid rent with the landlord, Odeon, which resulted in eviction, the EasyCinema closed in May 2006 and reopened as an Odeon cinema. The closure of the Milton Keynes EasyCinema appears to have curtailed the desired expansion into London's West End. In March 2005 saw the commencement of EasyCinema Online DVD Rental (stylised as easyCinema), first announced in November 2004. This is a partnership with LOVEFiLM, the company operating rental services for several other retail brands. However, unlike many online DVD rental services, there is no monthly subscription but the user purchases rental credits. On 1 August 2012 the easyCinema website and branding ceased and became wholly branded as LOVEFiLM.  Easy4Men On 9 December 2004 the men's toiletries range Easy4Men was launched together with Boots. Originally conceived to challenge Gillette, the product line did not include a razor. After disappointing sales, the partnership with Boots was dissolved in 2006. As of 2011, it is no longer in operation.  EasyMusic  EasyMusic began operation on 22 December 2004 in conjunction with Wippit. It sold copyrighted music downloads offered from 25p, although the minimum transaction value is ¬£1 and there are charges for using credit cards and SMS payment methods. The service stopped selling downloads in January 2008, but began to sells CDs in conjunction with CDwow.  EasyEnergy  EasyEnergy was founded in 2016 by Dutch entrepreneurs Maarten Roelfs and Raymond van Eck and market launched on 28 March 2017. EasyEnergy was acquired by the current owner NieuweStroom on 29 June 2018. EasyEnergy will provide domestic customers access to wholesale energy prices, for a fixed monthly fee. EasyEnergy is only active in the Netherlands.  EasyCruise  A no frills cruise ship called EasyCruise was launched on Friday 6 May 2005, targeting the 18-40 age-group, rather than the traditional retired market. The first vessel was known as EasyCruiseOne. Expansion of the EasyCruise fleet was announced in 2006. A franchise operation using a converted river freighter EasyCruiseTwo operated from 2006 until 17 August 2007. EasyCruise was sold to Hellenic Seaways in August 2009 for ¬£9 million.  EasyMobile  EasyMobile was a mobile virtual network operator, launched in March 2005 (not to be confused with EasyMobile, which was founded in 2003 by Karl Kahn) as a pay as you go service in partnership with TDC. The service closed on 13 December 2006. Rival mobile service, Orange, attempted to sue EasyGroup as it claimed the use of the orange EasyMobile logo breached its trademark and could confuse customers. The EasyMobile service was also launched in the Netherlands, but this service closed at short notice at the end of July 2006.  EasyCoach  EasyCoach is a local bus company started in January 2017 by Andrew Martin and was based in Shrewsbury. The company ran the 436 in Shrewsbury but was re-tendered due to 'high number of passenger complaints relating to the performance of this service' On 27 June 2018, EasyCoach started routes 2 (Wrexham - Oswestry) and 2D (Wrexham - Cefn Mawr) against Arriva Midlands as well as routes 42 (Wrexham Bus Station - Wrexham Industrial Estate) and 44 (Wrexham Bus Station - Snowdon Drive Circular). These services were hit with many delays and breakdowns. The Wrexham services will be withdrawn from 9 September with Mr Martin blaming 'certain individuals had been out to sabotage the business'.  EasyDogwalker  Established in 2018, EasyDogwalker provide dog walking and pet sitting services, backed by the EasyGroup. Legal action In the past EasyGroup has threatened legal action against several businesses using \\"easy\\" as part of their name. In 2002, Easyart.com (now King and McGaw) faced legal allegations from EasyGroup over its use of the easy name, accusing Easyart of \\"passing off\\" on easyGroup's good name. Easyart.com, which launched in September 1999, strenuously denied the charge and vowed to challenge Mr Haji-Ioannou in the high court. Easyart.com won the court battle when EasyGroup discontinued its legal action, saying it had \\"bigger targets to go after\\". Simon Matthews, the chief executive of Easyart.com, said in a statement \\"Stelios has surrendered and we have won. The law states a claimant who discontinues his claim is conceding he has lost or cannot win the case.\\" Before commencing legal action EasyGroup's lawyers bombarded Easyart.com with threatening letters, despite having accepted ¬£2,000 worth of advertising from the art company in its EasyInternet cafes not long after it launched. \\"This was a David and Goliath fight. It is a good day for smaller companies who stand up to bullying tactics from large corporations. We hope this gives hope to many other companies out there who are trading legitimately under the 'Easy' name and who have been threatened by this man,\\" said Mr Matthews. In 2005, EasyGroup threatened legal action against a Welsh company which had been trading as EasyMobile since 2003, two years before the launch of EasyGroup's EasyMobile business. EasyGroup dropped action against London businessman Karl Kahn after it emerged that his EasyPizza business predated EasyGroup's business of the same name by several years. In 2008, a restaurant in Northampton agreed to stop calling itself \\"easyCurry\\" after threats of legal action from EasyGroup. In 2011, the Edmonton-based company Eezy Drive received a letter from EasyGroup's lawyer Clarke Willmott, asking the owner Zeeshan Haniffa to stop using the name of his driving school, Ezee Drive Driving School, accusing him of ‚Äúintellectual property infringement‚Äù and giving him seven days to destroy ¬£1,000-worth of signs, leaflets and posters using the name, and hand over website domain names within two weeks. Zeeshan Haniffa said in a statement: ‚ÄúWhen I received this letter, it seemed more like a threat to scare me off. They are accusing me of passing off on their name and misleading the marketplace. But there is no confusion, no misleading and no passing off. I think they are trying to bully me into doing what they want.‚Äù EasyGroup said it is ‚Äúunfair‚Äù to brand its actions as bullying, adding: ‚ÄúWe expressly encourage the recipient to seek legal advice‚Äù. It added in a statement: ‚ÄúWe protect the ‚Äòeasy‚Äô brand in order to protect consumers. In this way, we ensure that they are not misled into thinking they are dealing with an easyGroup company - on coming across a brand, the logo is not always visible, as is the case with radio advertising or Google ads which contain no specific font.‚Äù In 2012, a Northwich-based gym called Easy Exercise was challenged that it could not use the Easy name, with EasyGroup citing \\"The easy name is synonymous with quality, value for money services and we have a duty to protect the public from its unauthorised use.\\" Pete Landon, managing director of Easy Exercise, which helps older women keep their mobility, said he was given an 80 per cent chance of success by his lawyers when threatened with the High Court action but the potential costs of losing, followed by a ¬£100,000 bill in costs, would have been too much to handle: ‚ÄúIt is a risk we would like to take but one we simply cannot afford. We have spent thousands on arguing our case and cannot accept the easyGroup proposition that the public actually believe that any goods or services marketed under the word ‚Äòeasy‚Äô are done so with Stelios‚Äô consent. The easyGroup makes millions of profit and yet still threatens small businesses like our own in this way and while we would really like to fight on, we know that should we lose, we would not only pick up our own legal bill but also that of the easyGroup. We already face thousands in legal costs, the loss of our domain name and ¬£50,000 for rebranding as Friendly Gym. We are not the first small company to become a casualty of easyGroup and I am sure we will not be the last. The Intellectual Property Office should never have granted the exclusive use of ‚Äòeasy‚Äô to Stelios who now has the monopoly on a word in daily use ‚Äù In July 2010, Sir Stelios criticised the previous chief executive of easyJet's (Andy Harrison) handling of airline punctuality. In a statement he said: \\"I have been receiving many unsolicited complaints from members of the public and even easyJet pilots about the degree that the airline is short of crew to operate the flights it sold to its customers. Unless Mike Rake [the chairman] and Carolyn McCall [the new chief executive] do something to improve the situation for the sake of the travelling public, I am left with no option but to terminate the brand licence.\\" Other differences have emerged concerning travel-associated \\"extras\\" such as hotel bookings under the \\"easyJethotels\\" brand, and car hire under \\"easyJetcarhire\\". EasyGroup contended that it licensed the \\"easyJet\\" brand primarily for airline use, and that using the brand for hotel and car hire interfered with other easyGroup businesses. In September 2018, EasyGroup was taking legal action against Netflix over its comedy series Easy, claiming its use of the name breaches his company's European trademarks. Netflix said in a statement that ‚Äúviewers can tell the difference between a show they watch and a plane they fly in‚Äù.

Her phlegmatic and slightly bemused approach to a series of disastrous situations culminated in her extricating the party from a foreign jail by making advances to the local police chief. In some ways this was a stereotypical Carry On part: a young woman in a uniform who, from time to time, was reduced to a state of semi-undress, as, for example, when the touring party consumed an elixir with pronounced aphrodisiacal qualities.

After graduating high school he joined the Marine Corps until 1955. He served in Korea during 1953. After leaving the Marines he moved to California and eventually had a son with his then-wife Luana. Wantling went to San Quentin State Prison in 1958 convicted of forgery and possession of narcotics. During his imprisonment Luana divorced him and took custody of the child. He was released in 1963, and returned to Peoria. There he married Ruth Ann Bunton, a fellow divorcee, in 1964. In 1966 he enrolled at Illinois State University, where he received both a BA and MA. He taught at the university up until his death on May 2, 1974. Wantling died of heart failure, possibly brought about by his extensive drug use. Wantling's life as a Marine Wantling alleged that he was the youngest Marine Sergeant (at 18) in combat. He also claimed that he spent ten days in a coma and eight weeks in the hospital recovering from burns after the jeep he was riding in hit a landmine, causing a 50-gallon barrel of gasoline on the jeep to ignite. However scholar W.D. Ehrhart had established that Wantling never saw combat and did not receive a purple heart medal, which would have been awarded to any soldier injured as a result of enemy action.Ehrhart, W.D.: \\"Setting the Record Straight on William Wantling\\", http://www.wlajournal.com/12_2/Ehrhart.pdf, p.224-230 Appearance in other writers' work A character based on Wantling has appeared in the poetry of Charles Bukowski, who was an acquaintance. Wantling and his second wife also appeared as characters in Bukowski's 1978 novel Women. Poetry Much of his poetry deals with his time spent in Korea during the war. Pusan Liberty is a first person account of the life of a heroin dealer in Pusan, South Korea. And without laying claim is a short and shocking poem about the indifference with which the American forces treated killing. Initiation is about a couple trying to raise money to sustain their drug (presumably heroin) addiction. Unwilling to rob a stranger, the girlfriend offers to sell her body. Poetry is about the failure of classic poetic devices to capture the reality and brutality of prison life. The three poems mentioned above are included in the collection The Awakening by William Wantling (Rapp & Whiting, London, 1968) and the last two are included in San Quentin's Stranger by William Wantling (Caveman Press, Dunedin, 1973). Obscene & Other Poems (Caveman Press, 14 pages, Dunedin, 1972) contains 5 poems in an edition of 600 copies. Biographical inaccuracies W.D. Ehrhart attempted to reconstruct Wantling's life by looking at military and prison records. He concluded that: > ...what little we know about his life has already become distorted and > mythologized, fiction made fact by constant repetition.\\"Ehrhart, W.D.: > \\"Setting the Record Straight on William Wantling\\", > http://www.wlajournal.com/12_2/Ehrhart.pdf, p.224-230 As a consequence it seems that much of Wantling's biography must be taken with a certain amount of skepticism.

He came to England in 1847, where he established restaurants and an ice importing business. He is credited with first making ice cream available to the general public. He moved into music halls. He returned to Switzerland in 1871, leaving his businesses in the hands of members of his family. He died a millionaire. Gatti originated in Canton Ticino, the main Italian-speaking area of Switzerland. He was probably born in Marogno, a village within the then commune of Dongio, where he also ended his days. He was the youngest of a family of six, his parents being Stefano and Apollonia. In 1839 Carlo was married to Maria Marioni, by his eldest brother Giacomo, the priest at Castro.Kinross, Felicity. Coffee and Ices, the story of Carlo Gatti in London, privately published, 1991.  Success in London  Carlo had moved to London by 1847 at the latest, and lived in the Italian community in Holborn. At first, he ran a stall selling waffles and chestnuts.Biography at the London Canal Museum website In 1849, he began to run a caf√© and restaurant with partners. They specialised in selling chocolate and ice cream. They put a chocolate-making machine in the window to attract business, and took ice for the ice cream from Regent's Canal under a contract with the Regent's Canal Company. Their shop was the first to sell ice cream to the public; previously, ice cream was an expensive treat confined to rich people with access to an ice house. Gatti exhibited his chocolate-making machine, imported from France, at the Great Exhibition in 1851. Also in 1851, Gatti opened a stand in Hungerford Market, near Charing Cross, to sell pastries and ice cream. A portion of ice cream was sold for one penny served in a shell, perhaps the origin of the penny lick. Gatti built a large ice warehouse, capable of storing tons of ice in two large ice wells, in the Battlebridge Basin off the Regent's Canal, near King's Cross. He began importing ice from Norway from around 1860, shipping the ice from Norway, up the Thames, then transferring it to canal barges at the Regent's Canal Dock (today the Limehouse Basin) and via the canal to his ice warehouse. Starting with a single ice well in 1857, he built a second ice well around 1862, and became the largest ice importer in London. Today the ice warehouse houses the London Canal Museum. He began to run a fleet of delivery carts, supplying ice for domestic iceboxes. Hungerford Market was damaged when the adjoining Hungerford Hall burned down in 1854, but Gatti was insured, and used the proceeds to build a music hall, known as Gatti's, which opened in 1857. He sold the music hall to South Eastern Railway in 1862, and the site became Charing Cross railway station. Tomb of Carlo Gatti in the town cemetery of Bellinzona With the proceeds from selling his first music hall, Gatti acquired a restaurant in Westminster Bridge Road, opposite the Canterbury Music Hall. He converted the restaurant into a second Gatti's music hall, known as \\"Gatti's-in-the-Road\\", in 1865. It later became a cinema. The building was badly damaged in the Second World War, and was demolished in 1950. In 1867, he acquired a public house in Villiers Street named \\"The Arches\\", under the arches of the elevated railway line leading to Charing Cross station. He opened it as another music hall, known as \\"Gatti's-in-The- Arches\\". Members of his family were involved in his businesses, and he spent most of his time in Switzerland after 1871. He married a second wife, aged only 23. He is buried in Switzerland. His family continued to operate the music hall, known for a period after Gatti's death the Hungerford or Gatti's Hungerford Palace of Varieties. It became a cinema in 1910, and the Players' Theatre in 1946.

This is accomplished by looking for and analyzing relationships between events. History Event correlation has been used in various fields for many years: * since the 1970s, telecommunications and industrial process control; * since the 1980s, network management and systems management; * since the 1990s, IT service management, publish-subscribe systems (pub/sub), Complex Event Processing (CEP) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM); * since the early 2000s, Distributed Event-Based Systems and Business Activity Monitoring (BAM). Examples and application domains Integrated management is traditionally subdivided into various fields: * layer by layer: network management, system management, service management, etc. * by management function: performance management, security management, etc. Event correlation takes place in different components depending on the field of study: * Within the field of network management, event correlation is performed in a management platform typically known as a Network Management Station or Network Management System (NMS). For example, events may notify that a device has just rebooted or that a network link is currently down. * Within the field of systems management, an event may for instance report that the CPU utilization of an e-business server has been at 100% for over 15 minutes. * Within the field of service management, an event may notify that a Service-Level Objective is not met for a given customer, for example. * Within the field of security management, the management platform is usually known as the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), and event correlation is often performed in a separate correlation engine. That engine may directly receive events in real time, or it may read them from SIEM storage. In this case, examples of monitored events include activity such as authentication, access to services and data, and output from point security tools such as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) or antivirus software. In this article, we focus on event correlation in integrated management and provide links to other fields. Event correlation in integrated management The goal of integrated management is to integrate the management of networks (data, telephone and multimedia), systems (servers, databases and applications) and IT services in a coherent manner. The scope of this discipline notably includes network management, systems management and Service-Level Management. Events and event correlator Event correlation usually takes place inside one or several management platforms. It is implemented by a piece of software known as the event correlator. This component is automatically fed with events originating from managed elements (applications, devices), monitoring tools, the Trouble Ticket System, etc. Each event captures something special (from the event source standpoint) that happened in the domain of interest to the event correlator, which will vary depending upon the type of analysis the correlator is attempting to perform. The event correlator plays a key role in integrated management, for only within it do events from many disparate sources come together and allow for comparison across sources. For instance, this is where the failure of a service can be ascribed to a specific failure in the underlying IT infrastructure, or where the root cause of a potential security attack can be identified. Most event correlators can receive events from trouble ticket systems. However, only some of them are able to notify trouble ticket systems when a problem is solved, which partly explains the difficulty for Service Desks to keep updated with the latest news. In theory, the integration of management in organizations requires the communication between the event correlator and the trouble ticket system to work both ways. An event may convey an alarm or report an incident (which explains why event correlation used to be called alarm correlation), but not necessarily. It may also report that a situation goes back to normal, or simply send some information that it deems relevant (e.g., policy P has been updated on device D). The severity of the event is an indication given by the event source to the event destination of the priority that this event should be given while being processed. Step-by-step decomposition Event correlation can be decomposed into four steps: event filtering, event aggregation, event masking and root cause analysis. A fifth step (action triggering) is often associated with event correlation and therefore briefly mentioned here. =Event filtering= Event filtering consists in discarding events that are deemed to be irrelevant by the event correlator. For instance, a number of bottom-of- the-range devices are difficult to configure and occasionally send events of no interest to the management platform (e.g., printer P needs A4 paper in tray 1). Another example is the filtering of informational or debugging events by an event correlator that is only interested in availability and faults. =Event aggregation= Event aggregation is a technique where multiple events that are very similar (but not necessarily identical) are combined into an aggregate that represents the underlying event data. Its main objective is to summarize a collection of input events into a smaller collection that can be processed using various analytics methods. For example, the aggregate may provide statistical summaries of the underlying events and the resources that are affected by those events. Another example is temporal aggregation, when the same problem is reported over and over again by the event source, until the problem is finally solved. Event de-duplication is a special type of event aggregation that consists in merging exact duplicates of the same event. Such duplicates may be caused by network instability (e.g., the same event is sent twice by the event source because the first instance was not acknowledged sufficiently quickly, but both instances eventually reach the event destination). =Event masking= Event masking (also known as topological masking in network management) consists of ignoring events pertaining to systems that are downstream of a failed system. For example, servers that are downstream of a crashed router will fail availability polling. =Root cause analysis= Root cause analysis is the last and most complex step of event correlation. It consists of analyzing dependencies between events, based for instance on a model of the environment and dependency graphs, to detect whether some events can be explained by others. For example, if database D runs on server S and this server gets durably overloaded (CPU used at 100% for a long time), the event ‚Äúthe SLA for database D is no longer fulfilled‚Äù can be explained by the event ‚ÄúServer S is durably overloaded‚Äù. =Action triggering= At this stage, the event correlator is left with at most a handful of events that need to be acted upon. Strictly speaking, event correlation ends here. However, by language abuse, the event correlators found on the market (e.g., in network management) sometimes also include problem- solving capabilities. For instance, they may trigger corrective actions or further investigations automatically. Event correlation in other fields=Event correlation in ITIL The scope of ITIL (the Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is larger than that of integrated management. However, event correlation in ITIL is quite similar to event correlation in integrated management. In the ITIL version 2 framework, event correlation spans three processes: Incident Management, Problem Management and Service Level Management. In the ITIL version 3 framework, event correlation takes place in the Event Management process. The event correlator is called a correlation engine.

It resulted in the Communists taking the island from the nationalists. Order of battle: *Defenders: nationalist order of battle: **The 17th Army *Attackers: communist order of battle: **The 91st Division of the 31st Army **The 94th Division of the 32nd Army After Zhangzhou-Xiamen Campaign, more than 5000 soldiers of the Nationalist 17th Army retreated to Eastern Mountain (Dongshan, ‰∏úÂ±±) Island off Fujian. Since the Nationalists were using the island as a stepping-stone to launch raids against the mainland, the 91st Division of the 31st Army and the 94th Division of the 32nd Army of the People's Liberation Army launched an assault to take the island on 11 May 1950 with the help of three artillery battalions. After 10 hours of fighting, the Nationalist retreated from the island, having suffered some 2,044 fatalities. The Communist victory was a result of lessons learned in previous battles with the Nationalist troops for control over coastal islands, including the Battle of Kuningtou, the Battle of Denbu Island, and the Battle of Nan'ao Island, each of which illustrated the necessity for massing absolute numerical and technical superiority. As a result, the attackers outnumbered the defenders nearly three to one. While a strategic loss for the Nationalists, the abandonment of the Eastern Mountain (Dongshan, ‰∏úÂ±±) Island did teach valuable lessons. Primarily it resulted in less overstretch and better handling of defence on islands closer to Taiwan proper. The Nationalists also learned from the mistakes used in their defence and battle, as shown three years later during the Dongshan Island Campaign, when they attacked and seized islands they'd previously abandoned.

She was returning from her second voyage East under Captain Fern√£o de Mendon√ßa Furtado when she was captured. Description Built in Lisbon in 1589, she was in length, had a beam of , measured 1,600 tons burthen, and could carry 900 tons of cargo. She had seven decks, thirty-two guns in addition to other arms, 600 to 700 crew members, a gilded superstructure and a hold filled with treasure. Capture In 1592, by virtue of the Iberian Union, the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 was in abeyance, and as the Anglo‚ÄìSpanish War was still ongoing, Portuguese shipping was a fair target for the Royal Navy. On 3 August 1592 (sources vary as to the date) a six-member English naval squadron fitted out by the Earl of Cumberland and Walter Raleigh set out to the Azores to intercept Spanish shipping from the New World when a Portuguese fleet came their way near Corvo Island.The Gulf Stream and the Westerlies converge near the Azores, where ships coming from both areas would pass. The English took her after a fierce day-long battle near Flores Island in which many Portuguese sailors were killed. Among these riches were chests filled with jewels and pearls, gold and silver coins, ambergris, rolls of the highest-quality cloth, fine tapestries, 425 tons of pepper, 45 tons of cloves, 35 tons of cinnamon, 3 tons of mace, 3 tons of nutmeg, 2.5 tons of benjamin (a highly aromatic balsamic resin used for perfumes and medicines), 25 tons of cochineal and 15 tons of ebony.An inventory was taken, and the report produced mentions \\"Gods great favor towards our nation, who by putting this purchase into our hands hath manifestly discovered those secret trades & Indian riches, which hitherto lay strangely hidden, and cunningly concealed from us\\". It also speaks of the following goods aboard, besides jewels: \\"spices, drugs, silks, calicos, quilts, carpets and colors, &c.; The spices were pepper, cloves, maces, nutmegs, cinnamon, greene, ginger: the drugs were benjamin, frankincense, galingale, mirabilis, aloes zocotrina, camphire: the silks, damasks, taffatas, scarceness, alto bassos, that is, counterfeit, cloth of gold, unwrought China silk, sleeved silk, white twisted silk, curled cypresse. The calicos were book-calicos, calico-launes, broad white calicos, fine starched calicoes, course white calicos, brown broad calicos, brown course calicos. There were also canopies, and course diapertowels, quilts of course sarcenet and of calico, carpets like those of Turkey; whereunto are to be added the pearl, muske, civet, and amber-griece. The rest of the wares were many in number, but less in value; as elephants teeth, porcelain vessels of China, coco-nuts, hides, ebenwood as black as jet, bested of the same, cloth of the rind‚Äôs of trees very strange for the matter, and artificial in workmanship\\". There was also a document, printed at Macau in 1590, containing valuable information on the China and Japan trade; Hakluyt observes that it was \\"enclosed in a case of sweet Cedar wood, and lapped up almost an hundredfold in fine Calicut-cloth, as though it had been some incomparable jewel\\". Aftermath The carrack whilst at Dartmouth, England was subject to theft on an industrial scale; it attracted all manner of traders, dealers, cutpurses, and thieves from miles around. By the time Walter Raleigh had restored order, a cargo estimated at half a million pounds (nearly half the size of England's treasury and perhaps the second-largest treasure ever after the Ransom of Atahualpa) had been reduced to ¬£140,000.

The film features Vijay, Shalini and Kaveri in the leading roles, while Raghuvaran, Srividya and Ponvannan play other supporting roles. It was Vijay's 25th film and his first film of the new 2000s millennium.http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movies-cinema-news-14/how-did- the-25th-films-of-ajith-vijay-and-suriya-turn-out.html In 2017, the film was dubbed into Hindi as My Duty by WAM India Movies.  Plot  The film is about a person who suffers from a neurological condition that results in partial retrograde amnesia and delusions due to a head injury and his subsequent recovery thanks to a kind girl and her psychiatrist father. The film opens to Gautham Prabhakar (Vijay) searching all around Pondicherry in vain for a girl named Gayathri. He encounters a group of friends headed by Hema (Shalini) and requests their help in locating Gayathri (Kaveri), who appears to be Gautham's lover. The group members are initially hostile to him but eventually decide to help him after Gautham pursues them aggressively and Hema realizes that he may be suffering from a neurological condition resulting in amnesia and delusions. Hema's father Dr. Rajashekar (Raghuvaran) is a psychiatrist who discovers Gautham's real condition and the dangers it poses. It is revealed that Gautham was actually a musicologist. About six months earlier, he had traveled to a hill resort in Tamil Nadu for his research on musical patterns in the sounds of nature. While in that trip, he encountered three men - Prakash (Shajin), Soundar (Ponvannan), and Shanmugam (Thalaivasal Vijay) - who all hailed from Pondicherry. Gayathri (Kaveri) was a local girl who was teased frequently by the three men. Gayathri regularly ran up to Gautham to seek refuge from the men's pursuits. Then, one day, the three men got drunk and began molesting Gayathri. Hearing her screams, Gautham and his friend Balaji attempted to rescue Gayathri. In the ensuing fight, Balaji's knee was struck with an axe, Gayathri dropped unconscious, and Gautham was hit hard on the head with the blunt end of the axe. The way Gautham remembers it is - the three men had molested and murdered Gayathri and then had left Gautham for dead after striking him on the head. Gautham, in his hypnotic state, swears furiously to Rajashekar that he will avenge Gayathri's murder by capturing and killing the three men responsible. As it is revealed later in the film, Gayathri had not died but had merely passed out. Rajasekhar explains to Hema and her friends the reason why Gautham kept viewing Gayathri as his lover in his delusional state, even though she actually had no relationship with Gautham and he was merely trying to be a Good Samaritan. He also explains that if Gautham was treated and his memories brought back, then it could potentially create a new Gautham, a violent and aggressive one, who goes on a killing spree. Unable to make a decision on the next step forward, on Hema's suggestion, they decide to delay any action until Gautham's mother (Srividya) arrived from Malaysia. It is revealed through intermittent scenes that the mother, having not had contact with her son in all of the previous six months, is already out of her home, searching desperately for her son in India. Until the mother arrived, the kind Hema takes care of Gautham. Gautham, for unknown reasons, becomes fond of Hema and believes deeply that Hema is the only person who can help him, and in return Hema also begins to develop feelings of affection and love towards him. Hema even wonders if it would be possible to bring Gautham back to normal by showing him enough care and affection that he forgets about Gayathri altogether. This strategy fails, as once the mother arrives, Gautham's past memories come flooding back to him and he turns into a reckless revenge-seeker, terrorizing both his mother and Hema, and swearing to kill the three men who had supposedly murdered Gayathri. The remainder of the film is about how Hema and Gautham's mother put up with the new villainous Gautham, while Rajashekar devises and implements an ingenious plan to cure him. Rajashekar manages to contact the three men, who reveal the truth - Gayathri was still alive. The three men are innocent, and the only terrible mistake they had done was drunkenly striking Gautham on the head, resulting in this whole mess. While Gautham manages to capture Prakash and Soundar for his revenge, Rajashekar and Shanmugam manage to trick him successfully into entering Gayathri's current home by giving him a chase. Gautham is initially dumbstruck at seeing Gayathri still alive, but then reality eventually sinks into him, and he is cured completely. He apologizes to his mother, Shanmugam, and Hema for his torturous acts, reveals the location where he held the other two men captive, and profusely thanks Rajashekar and Hema for their efforts. Hema looks on sadly as she wonders if this is the last she would see of him. Rajashekar senses this and gives a non-verbal consent for Gautham to take his daughter with him. Hema is overjoyed and the two, along with Gautham's mother, drive back.

The reviewer added that the film was \\"subtle in scenic presentation and characterisation, suspense without melodrama and spontaneity in reactions are plusses\\", while mentioning that Shalini was \\"flawless\\" in her role. Rediff.com described it as a \\"film worth seeing\\", labelling that \\"the highlight of the film is actor Vijay's power-packed performance\\". The critic described that the \\"actor has shown laudable skill both in the way he has handled this complicated role and in expressing various shades of Gautham's tormented mind. Especially from the moment he becomes aggressive, with the violent streak predominating and eyes blazing with manic fury.\\" K. N. Vijiyan of New Straits Times noted that the film \\"offers something different from usual love stories and should appease Vijay's fans\\".

The stated mission of the ORS is to advance orthopaedic research through education, collaboration, communication and advocacy. The ORS aims to increase resources for research, and awareness of the importance and impact of such research on orthopaedic patients and the public. The Journal of Orthopaedic Research is the official journal of ORS.  History Collaboration has been at the cornerstone of the Orthopaedic Research Society since it was founded in 1954. In 1940, Dr. Alfred R. Shands, who would later become one of the founding members of the ORS served as the chair of the Research Committee of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. The committee conducted a survey of its member which indicated that just over 180 members were conducting some type of research. In the 1950s, several musculoskeletal investigators expressed a desire to have a forum for presenting their work and receiving constructive criticism. Dr. Phillip D. Wilson, a member of the Academy, along with several others, met in San Francisco and proposed the idea of starting an organization focused solely on musculoskeletal research. This idea gained unanimous support from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons at their Annual Meeting in 1951. In 1952, the first meeting of the founding members of the ORS took place. At this first meeting, Dr. Philip D. Wilson created a draft constitution and set of by-laws for the fledgling society. It was determined that the purpose of the society was to ‚Äúencourage and coordinate investigation and research in basic principles or clinical problems related to the special field of Orthopaedic Surgery.‚Äù Due to the unexpected death of Dallas B. Phemister, MD, who had agreed to take on the role of chairman, the formal organization of the society was delayed. 1954 marked the first official meeting of the group at the Palmer House in Chicago under the Chairmanship of Dr. Wilson. At this first meeting there were twenty-nine people in attendance. Cultivating the relationship between clinicians and scientists while providing them with opportunities to come together and share ideas was the driving factor in establishing the society. ‚ÄúThe close relationship of between clinicians and basic scientists would help ensure the prominent role of orthopaedic surgeons in delivering care to patients with injuries and diseases of the musculoskeletal system,‚Äù explained Eugene R. Mindell, MD who served as president of the ORS from 1972 ‚Äì 1973. The ORS continues to grow and evolve. Membership has grown to more than 4,100 members from across the globe. Once a role only held by surgeons, in 1982 the ORS elected Van C. Mow as the first PhD president. Currently, Presidents are elected from each of the three disciplines represented in the membership: clinicians, biologists, and engineers.

The campaign was the last and largest battle between two sides since the Nationalists withdrew to Taiwan. After this defeat, the nationalists realized that it was never practical to launch any large scale counterattack against the mainland on a similar scale again. Instead, the nationalist strikes against the mainland were reduced to limited infiltration and skirmishes. Order of battle *Attackers: nationalist order of battle (more than 10,000 men): **Two army divisions **One paratroop division (with two brigades totaling 2,000 men) **13 naval vessels **30+ motorized junks *Defenders: communist order of battle **The 80th Public Security Regiment and militia (1,200 men) **The 272nd Regiment of the 31st Army **A regiment of the 28th Army **A regiment of the 41st Army **The 91st Division of the 31st Army Prelude Shortly before dawn on 16 July 1953, the nationalist commander Hu Lien (ËÉ°Áêè) commanding his troops, totalling two divisions in 13 naval vessels and more than 30 motorized junks, sailed toward Dongshan Island, Fujian, attempting to retake the island from the communists who took the island from the Nationalists three years earlier in the Battle of Dongshan Island. In addition to the two army divisions, an elite paratroop division totaling 2,000 personnel in two brigades was deployed for the mission, and the total Nationalist force committed was just over 10,000. The Nationalists had hoped to turn the island into another stronghold at near the enemy and use it as a steppingstone to launch strikes against the mainland, but many capable Nationalist commanders included the commander of this operation, Hu Lien, remained highly doubtful this would ever succeed, and after fierce debate, a compromise was reached: a much more moderate objective of striking the island to gain a political and morale boost and then a quick withdraw before the enemy could reinforce the island, and when the situation permitted, turn the island into a stronghold like the original plan. The Communist local defense consisted of the 80th Public Security Regiment and militia totaling 1,200 men, obviously not enough, so the communist commander Ye Fei instructed the local garrison to decide what was best for itself, including withdraw if necessary, and attempt to retake the enemy later. The Communist local commander You Meiyao (Ê∏∏Ê¢ÖËÄÄ), a staff officer of the Chen Yi during the Second Sino-Japanese War, refused to withdraw because that would allow the Nationalists to utilise the Communist fortifications on the island, making future attempts to dislodge the Nationalists from the island very difficult. You Meiyao suggested while the reinforcement was organized as fast as possible, the local garrison would utilise the advantageous landscape and fortifications on the island to slow the enemy down by inflicting as many casualties as possible, and once the attackers were exhausted, the defenders would counterattack with reinforcements. First stage The first shot of the campaign was fired at 5:00 AM on July 16, 1953 when a Nationalist division landed on the island. After three hours of fierce fighting, the enemy's first line of defense was breached, and the Nationalists succeeded in forcing the enemies into their second line of defense. By the end of the day, the Nationalists had successfully taken the largest port on the island and controlled most of the island. Despite taking most of the island, the Communist resistance in the few remaining isolated pockets proved to be much stronger than anticipated. Communist mortar fire badly damaged the port facilities including the pier, but also scored direct hits on three large landing ships. Although the mortar rounds themselves were not powerful enough to completely destroy the landing ships which carried heavy weaponry and ammunition, the secondary explosions triggered by the direct hits by the enemy heavy mortars were enough to sink all three landing ships. Since the motorized junks with shallow draft were not severely effected by the wreckage, Nationalists were still able to transport personnel onto the island via these junks, but ships carrying heavy weaponry were effectively blocked due to greater draft. The Nationalists, however, did not consider the problem to be serious because the enemy was mostly light infantry anyway, a mistake that they would later deeply regret. In addition to failing to realize the problem caused, the nationalists were not able to take the highest point of the island from the enemy and although most of the enemy heavy mortars were knocked out with air support, the surviving ones did not stop shelling the nationalists until the very last round of ammunition had been exhausted. The only Communist stronghold left on the island was in the region of Eight Feet Gate (Ba Chi Men, ÂÖ´Â∞∫Èó®), which faced the mainland, defended by a single company of communist naval infantry. The strongly fortified position included a pier and thus was the critical steppingstone for Communist reinforcement from the mainland. The Nationalists had correctly identified this serious threat and had also correctly decided to eliminate this threat early on, so entire American trained paratroop division which reached the island first was devoted for the mission. However, the lightly armed paratroopers proved to be no match for the enemy in heavily fortified positions on the terrain that strongly favored the defenders. Despite repeated assaults, the elite paratroopers failed to achieve their original objective, but also suffered heavy loss, with several hundred killed and wounded. The lack of heavy weaponry was the main cause of the Nationalist failure to take this very important position, which paved the way for the eventual nationalist defeat in the campaign. Unable to take either of the two remaining enemy strongholds on the island, the battle reached a stalemate. Second stage Communist units on the mainland reacted rapidly by mobilizing all available vehicles to transport troops to the front. The communist 272nd Regiment of the 31st Army at Zhangpu County was first to respond: by 5:50 AM, less than an hour after the first shot of the campaign was fired, the advance guard of the regiment was already on its way to the front in the extremely few military vehicles available, while the rest of the regiment stop every civilian vehicles on the road to have the needed rides. By 9:00 AM, the entire regiment had reached the Eight Feet Gate (Ba Chi Men, ÂÖ´Â∞∫Èó®) pier of the Eastern Mountain (Dongshan, ‰∏úÂ±±) Island, with the help of newly arrived reinforcement, the communist naval infantry company at Eight Feet Gate (Ba Chi Men, ÂÖ´Â∞∫Èó®) managed to force the attacking nationalist paratroopers into retreat. A regiment of the communist the 28th Army and a regiment of the communist the 41st Army soon arrived afterward and the communist commander You Meiyao, riding on the initial success of driving back the attacking nationalist paratroopers, decided to immediately counterattack before the arrival of any other reinforcement so that the nationalists would not have the time needed to regroup, and successfully disrupted the nationalist defense and redeployment. As the Nationalists were forced back by the counterattacking enemy in the ensuing battles, the communist 91st Division of the 31st Army landed on the island under the commander of the 31st Army, Zhou Zhijian (Âë®ÂøóÂùö), the nationalists' fate on the island was thus sealed. The nationalist commander of the operation, Hu Lien, initially did not believed that the enemy could reinforce the island in such large scale in such short time, since the vital bridge, the Nine Dragons Bridge (Jiulongjiang Daqiao, ‰πùÈæôÊ±üÂ§ßÊ°•) was already destroyed by the Nationalist air force. Realizing that his force possessed neither technical nor the numerical advantages, Hu Lien wisely chose to withdraw before anymore enemy reinforcement arrived in order to avoid total annihilation. The enemy, in turn, seeing that what they sent was enough already to drive the attacking nationalists away from the island, did not pursuit and stopped sending further reinforcement. The campaign came to an end on July 18, 1953 after the island was secured by the defenders after the nationalist retreat. Outcome Dongshan Island Campaign was the last large scale nationalist counterattack against the mainland, Nationalist dead recovered by the communists on land and in the coastal waters totaled 2,664, and another 715 were captured, while the number of wounded was uncertain because most of them were successfully evacuated by the nationalists themselves. In addition, two tanks were destroyed, three landing ships sunk and two aircraft were also lost. In order to maintain the secrecy of this surprise attack, the Kuomintang simply went too far in that even their own troops were not informed about the mission until they were already on their way to the island. Many captured Nationalist officers did not feel it was a fair fight because they were not informed, and had they been better informed, they would postpone the attack to better train their troops. The poor Nationalist inter-service communication caused by the overly excessive secrecy also resulted in the nationalist landing ships unloading in the largest port on the island, which was directly within range of the enemy's heavy mortar positions. The slow landing ships loaded with heavy weaponry became sitting ducks as they were being unloaded, and in addition to three being sunk, the pier was also badly damaged by the accurate enemy fire. Another serious blunder committed by the attacking nationalist force included attempts to cut the communication link between the defenders and the mainland. Despite the fact that every single telephone line pole was cut down, nobody bothered to cut the actual line, or to wiretap the enemy's telephone line. As a result, the defenders were able to maintain communications with the mainland and the Communist commanders were much better aware the situation than their Nationalist counterparts. The other serious blunder committed by the attacking nationalist force was the grave underestimation of the Communist strength. Although the Nationalist order of battle included three divisions, none of them were full strength, and the elite paratroop division only included two brigades totaling 2,000 men, which was only the strength of a single brigade. Furthermore, due to the sinking of three landing ships at the port and the destruction of the port by enemy heavy mortar fire, most landing forces became light infantry which did not enjoy superior technical advantage over the enemy. This problem was further compounded by the incorrect use of the paratroopers by ordering them to attack the strongly fortified enemy positions at Eight Feet Gate Pier, resulting in more than 500 paratroopers killed, a staggering 25% of the total paratroop force devoted to the campaign. In addition to the loss of technical superiority due to the lack of heavy weaponry, the Nationalists also lacked the numerical superiority, which inevitably caused the final collapse of the offensive and the eventual failure. In addition to underestimating the enemy strength, the nationalists also underestimated the Communist capacity to repair damages inflicted by the opposing side. The nationalist intelligence calculated that after the air strikes that destroyed the vital Nine Dragons Bridge (Jiulong Jiang Daqiao, ‰πùÈæôÊ±üÂ§ßÊ°•), it would take at least two days for the enemy to repair the bridge, but in reality, the enemy had the bridge repaired in only two hours. As the news reached the surprised nationalists, it was obvious that the mission was over and in order to avoid complete disaster, the Nationalists wisely chose to give up the fighting by withdrawing the surviving forces and abandoned the island.

No. 1 in G minor, Op. 7, FS 16 is the first symphony of Danish composer Carl Nielsen. Written between 1891 and 1892, it was dedicated to his wife, Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen. The work's premi√®re, on 14 March 1894, was performed by Johan Svendsen conducting the Chapel Royal Orchestra (Royal Danish Orchestra), with Nielsen himself among the second violins. It is one of two symphonies by Nielsen without a subtitle (the other being his Symphony No. 5). The symphony is in the standard four movements, with the following tempo markings: # Allegro orgoglioso # Andante # Allegro comodo ‚Äî Andante sostenuto ‚Äî Tempo I # Finale. Allegro con fuoco A typical performance takes approximately 35 minutes. The symphony's melodies have a distinctive Danish flavour and are imbued with Nielsen's personal style. Nielsen scholar Robert Simpson describes the composer's symphonic debut as \\"probably the most highly organized first symphony ever written by a young man of twenty-seven.\\" The work opens in G minor, and closes with a rousing peroration in C major. This tendency to move away from the original key to C major is the basis of the whole symphony's tonal structure, and displays for the first time Nielsen's hallmark compositional device, \\"progressive tonality.\\" (Nielsen at one stage even thought of calling the work \\"Symphony in C\\".) Simpson states \\"it is possibly the first symphony to end in a key other than that in which it started\\".

It was released in November 1975 by Reprise Records in the US and Polydor Records in the UK. It was the second to be produced by Alan Douglas and Tony Bongiovi. The songs consist of post-Jimi Hendrix Experience recordings that originally featured Billy Cox on bass and either Mitch Mitchell or Buddy Miles on drums.  Background  Douglas continued the controversial methods he had adopted on Crash Landing and brought in many of the same session musicians to overdub parts of songs. The only original recording (apart from those by Hendrix) was Mitchell's drumming on \\"Hear My Train\\". In response to the previous outcry from fans and critics, Douglas did not claim co-writer credit for any songs on Midnight Lightning. Despite the fact that the album included reworkings of the popular live songs \\"Hear My Train\\" and \\"Machine Gun\\", the album was not as well received as its predecessor, peaking at numbers 43 in the US and 46 in the UK.  Critical reception  In Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau regarded Midnight Lightning as an improvement by Douglas over Crash Landing because of highlight instrumentals such as \\"Trash Man\\", overdubbed guitar from Jeff Mironov and Lance Quinn, and \\"the blues playing ‚Äî as opposed to singing or writing\\". AllMusic's Joe Viglione later said the enduring quality of Hendrix's music was retained in spite of Douglas's \\"doctoring and musicians jamming with his art after the fact.\\" Track listingPersonnel *Jimi Hendrixguitars, vocals *Mitch Mitchelldrums on track 3 Added in 1975 *Jeff Mironov - guitar on tracks 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 *Lance Quinn - guitar on tracks 2, 4, 6 and 7 *Allan Schwartzberg - drums on tracks 1, 2, 4-8, percussion on tracks 3 and 4 *Bob Babbitt - bass guitar *Jimmy Maelen - percussion on tracks 2 and 8 *Maeretha Stewart - backing vocals on tracks 2, 4 and 7 *Barbara Massey - backing vocals on tracks 2, 4 and 7 *Vivian Cherry - backing vocals on tracks 2, 4 and 7 *Buddy Lucas - harmonica on track 7 Original recording details and wiped backing musicians *Track 1 recorded at Olmstead Studios in New York City, New York on April 3, 1969.

This colourless liquid is one of the four isomeric amines of butane, the others being sec-butylamine, tert-butylamine, and isobutylamine. It is a liquid having the fishy, ammonia-like odor common to amines. The liquid acquires a yellow color upon storage in air. It is soluble in all organic solvents. Synthesis and reactions It is produced by the reaction of ammonia and alcohols over alumina: :CH3(CH2)3OH + NH3 ‚Üí CH3(CH2)3NH2 \\\\+ H2O n-Butylamine exhibits reactions typical of other simple alkyl amines, i.e. protonation, alkylation, acylation, condensation with carbonyls. Like other simple aliphatic amines, n-butylamine is a weak base: the pKa of [CH3(CH2)3NH3]+ is 10.78. n-Butylamine is also a commonly used ligand in coordination chemistry, which can coordinate with metal ions, such as Pt2+, Pd2+ ions, and form tetrabutylamine- or dibutylamine- metal complexes. Uses This compound is used as an ingredient in the manufacture of pesticides (such as thiocarbazides), pharmaceuticals, and emulsifiers. It is also a precursor for the manufacture of N,N‚Ä≤-dibutylthiourea, a rubber vulcanization accelerator, and n-butylbenzenesulfonamide, a plasticizer of nylon.

In 1971, 1973 and 1977, he was invited to the Florin exhibitions. He held his first personal exhibition at the gallery ‚ÄòInquadrature‚Äô in 1974. In 1974, he designed the windows for the Church of San Silvestro in Tobbiana di Prato. After 1975, he began to hold personal exhibitions in numerous Italian cities until, in 1979, he received a prestigious invitation to an ontological exhibition at the Olivetti Cultural Centre in Ivrea. A number of national and international collectives followed. By this time the themes of his work had already developed: landscaper with open skies, trees and isolated farmhouses. In 1979, Carlo Ludovico Ragghianti put him in charge of the drawing course at the International Art University in Florence. 1980s In 1984, he was among the five artists chosen by Leonardo Sciascia for the exhibition ‚ÄòArtists and Writers‚Äô held at the Rotonda of the Besana in Milan.

It held Norwegian officers arrested in 1942 and 1943. Originally most soldiers and officers had been released after the end of the Norwegian campaign, but as resistance activities increased, the officers were rearrested and sent to POW camps. Camp history The camp was originally established in June 1942 near Schokken (now Skoki) north of Pozna≈Ñ, in what had previously been Oflag XXI-A, opened in September 1940 as a camp for Polish officers. In March 1943 it was moved to Schildberg (now Ostrzesz√≥w) south of Ostr√≥w, taking over buildings previously used as a camp for wounded and sick British non-commissioned officers and designated Stalag XXI-A. This camp was unique in that it comprised several buildings in the centre of the small town, from which the remaining Polish inhabitants had been removed. These buildings were not adjacent to each other and were surrounded by barbed-wire fences. In 1944 the Norwegian officers were located as follows: 630 in the Seminary; 290 in the high-school; 100 in the primary school; 80 in the Richter house; 30 in hospital. There was also a sub- camp (Zweiglager), designated Oflag XXI-C/Z established at Grune bei Lissa (now Gron√≥wko, nr. Leszno), between September 1943 and January 1945. Liberation In January 1945 the officers were marched out westward, finally arriving at Oflag III-A in Luckenwalde, south of Berlin. On 21 April 1945 the Red Army liberated the camp. On 5 May 1945 the Norwegians were transported east to a camp near Lignica in Silesia, then travelled for several days by train to Hamburg and Aarhus, Denmark, finally arriving in Oslo on 28 May 1945.

Early history: background In the war of 1808-1809, Russian troops conquered Finland. Finland had been a part of Sweden and was annexed to the Russian empire at the Peace Treaty of Hamina on September 17th, 1809. Finland became an autonomous Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire. The Russian Tsar Alexander I (1801-1825) promised that Finland could uphold the existing religion, the basic laws and privileges of the social order. Finland was allowed to manage its affairs and employment of its own civil servants. A parliament began to assemble from the year 1863 - the same year where Finnish language got official status and became equal with the Swedish language. In 1865, Finland got its own currency - penni and markka - which quickly turned out to be stronger than the Russian Rouble. From the 1860s, trading - import and export - grow rapidly. Population grew from 1 million in 1809 to over 3 million by the end of World War I. Commemorative honoring Leevi Madetoja, 1987 When Alexander III ascended the throne in 1881, a process of making Finland a more integrated part of the empire started - many attacks were made in the Russian public on the special rights of the Finnish people and efforts were undertaken to abolish these special rights granted to them, and by many small steps this led to the Russification of the Finnish Post.

Standby power Standby power, informally called vampire or phantom power, refers to the electricity consumed by many appliances when they are switched off or in standby mode. The typical standby power per appliance is low (typically from less than 1 to 25 W), but, when multiplied by the billions of appliances in houses and in commercial buildings, standby losses represent a significant fraction of total world electricity use.One Watt Initiative : a Global Effort to Reduce Leaking Electricity Alan Meier & Beno√Æt LeBot, 1999 According to Alan Meier, a staff scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, standby power before the One Watt Initiative proposals were implemented as regulations accounted for as much as 10% of household power consumption. A study in France found that standby power accounted for 7% of total residential consumption, and other studies put the proportion of consumption due to standby power at 13%.Pulling the plug on standby power, The Economist Mar 9, 2006, The IEA estimated in 2007 that standby produced 1% of the world's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.Should we ban these bulbs? The Guardian, February 22, 2007 To put the figure into context, total air travel contributes less than 3% of global CO2 emissions.Flying the cleanly skies? Christian Science Monitor, February 12, 2007 Standby power can be reduced by technological means, reducing power used without affecting functionality, and by changing users' operating procedures.  Policy  The One Watt Initiative was launched by the IEA in 1999 to ensure through international cooperation that by 2010 all new appliances sold in the world use only one watt in standby mode. This would reduce CO2 emissions by 50 million tons in the OECD countries alone by 2010; the equivalent to removing 18 million cars from the roads.Global Implication of Standby Power Use, ACEEE Summer Study 2000. Lebot B. & Meier A In 2001 US President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13221, which states that every government agency, ‚Äúwhen it purchases commercially available, off-the-shelf products that use external standby power devices, or that contain an internal standby power function, shall purchase products that use no more than one watt in their standby power consuming mode.‚ÄùPulling the plug on standby power, The Economist, Mar 9 2006 By 2005 South Korea and Australia had introduced the one watt benchmark in all new electrical devices, and according to the IEA other countries, notably Japan and China, had undertaken \\"strong measures\\" to reduce standby power use.Standby power use and the IEA, One Watt Plan ‚Äì Fact Sheet , International Energy Agency 2005 In July 2007 California's 2005 appliance standards came into effect, limiting external power supply standby power to 0.5 watts. On 6 January 2010, the European Commission's EC Regulation 1275/2008 came into force regulating requirements for standby and \\"off mode\\" electric power consumption of electrical and electronic household and office equipment. The regulations mandate that from 6 January 2010 \\"off mode\\" and standby power shall not exceed 1 W, \\"standby-plus\\" power (providing information or status display in addition to possible reactivation function) shall not exceed 2 W (these figures are halved on 6 January 2013).

Historic furnishings may be displayed in a way that reflects their original placement and usage in a home. Historic house museums are held to a variety of standards, including those of the International Council of Museums. The International Council of Museums defines a museum as: \\"A museum as a non profit-making, permanent institution in the service of society and of its development, open to the public, which acquires, conserves, researches, communicates and exhibits, for purpose of study, education and enjoyment, the tangible and intangible evidence of people and their environment.\\" Houses are transformed into museums for a number of different reasons. For example, the homes of famous writers are frequently turned into writer's home museums to support literary tourism. About The Kings Hall at Skokloster Castle, Sweden William II in Huis Doorn in the Netherlands Kitchen in Museum Van Loon in Amsterdam in the Netherlands Residence of in Porvoo, Finland. Interior view of The Duke's Diwan in downtown Amman, Jordan. Also known as a ‚Äòmemory museum‚Äô, which is a term used to suggest that historic house museum contains a collection of the traces of memory of the people who once lived there. It is often made up of the inhabitants‚Äô belongings and objects ‚Äì this approach is mostly concerned with authenticity. Some museums are organised around the person who lived there or the social role the house had. Other historic house museums may be partially or completely reconstructed in order to tell the story of a particular area, social-class or historical period. The ‚Äònarrative‚Äô of the people who lived there guides this approach, and dictates the manner in which it is completed. In each kind of museum visitors learn about the previous inhabitants through an explanation and exploration of Social History. Philosophical/ideological influences The idea of a historic house museum derives from a branch of history called Social History that is solely based on people and their way of living.Social Memory Studies: From ‚ÄúCollective Memory‚Äù to Historical Sociology of Mnemonic Practices, Author(s): Jeffrey K. Olick and Joyce Robbins Source: Annual Review of Sociology, Vol. 24 (1998), pp. 105-140 It became very popular in the mid-twentieth century among scholars who were interested in the history of people, as opposed to political and economical issues. Social history remains an influential branch of history. Philip J. Ethington is a Professor of history and political science, further adds to social history and its relationship to locations by saying ‚Äì :\\"All human action takes and makes place. The past is the set of places made by human action. History is a map of these places.\\" Philip J. Ethington (2007): Placing the past: ‚ÄòGroundwork‚Äô for a spatial theory of history, Rethinking History, 11:4, 465-493 Following this historical movement, the concept of ‚ÄòOpen Air Museums‚Äô became prominent.'Open-Air Museums: Architectural History for the Masses Author(s): Edward A. Chappell Source: Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians', Vol. 58, No. 3, Architectural History 1999/2000 (Sep., 1999), pp. 334-341 These particular types of museums had interpreters in costume re-enact the lives of communities in earlier eras, which would then be performed to modern audiences. They often occupied large wooden architecture buildings or outdoor sites and landscapes, that were true to the era adding to authenticity. Collective memory Collective memory is sometimes used in the resurrection of historic house museums; however, not all historic house museums use this approach. The notion of Collective Memory originated from philosopher and sociologist Maurice Halbwachs, in ‚ÄòLa memoire collective‚Äô (‚ÄòOn Collective Memory‚Äô, 1950). This extended thesis examines the role of people and place, and how collective memory is not only associated with the individual but is a shared experience. It also focused on the way individual memory is influenced by social structures, as a way of continuing socialisation by producing memory as collective experience. :\\"Each aspect, each detail, of this place has a meaning intelligent only to members of the group, for each portion of its space corresponds to various and different aspects of the structure and life of their society, at least of what is stable in it.\\"The Collective Memory 1950, Chapter 4 ‚ÄòSpace and the Collective Memory‚Äô An example of a site that utilizes collective memory is the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park in Japan. It was restored and is based on the dialectics of memory, however it also has the inclusion of joyous festivals to mask the turmoil. The Hiroshima Traces (1999) text takes a look the importance of collective memory and how it is embedded in culture and place. Thus, collective memory does not only reside in a house or building, but it also resonates in outdoor space ‚Äì particularly when a monumental event has occurred, such as war. :\\"The taming of memory that can be observed in the city‚Äôs redevelopment projects reveals local mediations and manifestations of transnational as well as national structural forces.\\"Hiroshima Traces ‚Äì Time, Space, and the Dialectics of Memory, Lisa Yoneyama, University of California Press 1999 Problematic creation of collective memory occurs within historic house museums when the narrative of non-family members is dismissed, ignored, or completely rejected. Within the Southern United States, Plantation Museums (meaning the homes of former enslavers) constitute a significant portion of the museum community and contribute to the racialized collective memory of the United States. Because museums are responsible for ‚Äúthe building of identity, cultural memory and community,‚ÄùRepresentations of Slavery: Race and Ideology in Southern Plantation Museums, Jennifer Eichstedt and Stephen Small, Smithsonian Press 2002 neglecting to include the narrative of ALL people who lived there is dangerous. While some Plantation museum narratives have changed following an outcry from the public and the academy, ‚Äúplantation museums reflect, create, and contribute to racialized ways of understanding and organizing the world,‚ÄùRepresentations of Slavery: Race and Ideology in Southern Plantation Museums, Jennifer Eichstedt and Stephen Small, Smithsonian Press 2002, pp. 6 by eliminating and limiting the narrative of the enslaved inhabitants. Authenticity A degree of authenticity is also to be considered in the restoration and creation of a historic house museum. The space must be authentic in terms of truly replicating and representing the way it once stood in its original form and appear to be untouched and left in time. There are three steps when declaring if a space is authentic:‚ÄòAn Introduction to Authenticity in Preservation‚Äô, Pamela Jerome, APT Bulletin, Vol. 39, No. 2/3 (2008), pp. 3-7 # Proof of identity must be presented and certified by a credible individual # The attributes of the object or person must then be compared to the existing knowledge about it # Documentation and credentials must then be used to support it and thus declare if it is authentic. Organizations There are a number of Organizations around the world that dedicate themselves to the preservation, restoration, resurrection or promotion of historic house museums. They include: * Historic Houses Association (UK) * Historic House Trust of New York City * Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales * Historic Hudson Valley, Tarrytown, New York * Historic New England, Boston, MA * National Trusts of Australia * National Trust for Historic Preservation, Washington, D.C> * Save Our Heritage Organisation (San Diego, California) * The Artist's Studio Museum Network * The National Society of The Colonial Dames of America * Treasure Houses of England References House museums ","title":"Historic house museum"},{"id":"9650176","text":"Zubovo () is the name of several rural localities in Russia.

The motorcycle was powered by a 499.3 cc two stroke engine. Suzuki factory racing team rider Kevin Schwantz rode the RGV500 to its first Grand Prix victory at the 1988 Japanese Grand Prix. It won its first 500 cc world championship in 1993 when Schwantz outscored Wayne Rainey and Mick Doohan to win the title. This was the most successful period in the motorcycle's history. The Suzuki suited Schwantz's riding style, as he often pushed beyond the limit of the machine, which often lead to Schwantz crashing as often as he won. The Suzuki was always slower than its opposition, as both the Yamaha and especially the Honda were much faster in a straight line; to compensate for this, Schwantz set the RGV up so it would compensate in the braking zones, and in the corners, allowing the Suzuki to slipstream the machines in front. This style of riding was famously quoted by Schwantz stating that he would \\"See God, then brake\\". Other riders failed to adapt their style to the Suzuki, talent such as Doug Chandler and Alex Barros. However many did manage the Suzuki well such as Daryl Beattie who finished second overall in 1995 and Niall Mackenzie. Kenny Roberts Jr was another who was successful on the RGV. After finishing second in 1999, Roberts became Suzuki's last 500 cc World Champion in 2000. Didier de Radigu√®s won the 1991 Macau Grand Prix.

It was the accidental result of a selective breeding experiment using black Aberdeen Angus cattle at the Agricultural Research Centre of the Department of Agriculture of New South Wales at Trangie. It is among the smallest breeds of cattle, but is not a dwarf breed.  History  In 1929 the Department of Agriculture of New South Wales started an Aberdeen Angus herd at the Agricultural Research Centre at Trangie with stock imported from Canada. Various additions to the herd were made, from Canada, from the United States, from the United Kingdom and from other herds in Australia, until the herd-book was closed in 1964. From about this time, various research projects were conducted at Trangie. In 1974 an investigation of the correlation between growth rate and profitability, and of whether feed conversion efficiency was higher in large or in small animals fed on grass, was begun. In the study, three separate herds were established: one of animals with a high rate of growth in their first year, one with animals that had shown low growth, and one randomly selected as a control group. These were called the High Line, the Low Line and the Control Line respectively. The Low Line herd started with 85 cows and some young bulls, and was closed to additions of other stock from 1974; it eventually numbered more than 400. To exclude possible effects of climate from the study, some stock was reared at Glen Innes in northern New South Wales and at Hamilton, Victoria. The experiment ran for nineteen years, by the end of which the Low Line animals were on average some 30% smaller than the High Line group. When the experiment ended in the early 1990s, the Lowline stock was auctioned off. A breeders' association, the Australian Lowline Cattle Association, was formed in 1992, and the first herd-book was published in 1993; it listed 150 cows and 36 bulls. Australia is the only country which reports Lowline cattle to DAD-IS; the breeders' association has members in Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States.  Characteristics  The Australian Lowline is among the smallest of cattle breeds, but is not affected by dwarfism. Height is about 60% of that of the normal Aberdeen Angus breed, or about for bulls and for cows. Calves average about at birth, but may weigh as little as . The coat is usually solid black, but may also be solid red; some white colouring in the area of the scrotum or udder is tolerated. The cattle are naturally polled and are quiet-tempered. They adapt well to varying climatic conditions. Cows calve easily and provide plenty of milk to their young. Compared to larger cattle, the Lowline does less damage to pasture land, and does not need such high or strong fencing.  Use  The Australian Lowline is reared for beef. The meat is wellmarbled and tasty; carcass yield is high.

It began as a contest among New Yorkers who submitted stories about their experiences within the New York City Subway. HBO picked ten of the stories and cast mostly well-known or accomplished actors (such as Denis Leary, Bonnie Hunt, Rosie Perez and Bill Irwin), and ten well- respected directors (such as Jonathan Demme, Ted Demme, Abel Ferrara, Craig McKay, Julie Dash, and Bob Balaban).  Plot  Subway Stories is divided according to director into short films, each with their own title, but strung almost seamlessly together. *\\"Subway Car From Hell\\" **Directed by Jonathan Demme, written by Adam Brooks ***A man (Bill Irwin) tries to grab a bite to eat and get on a train during rush hour. He is unable to squeeze into packed cars. Spotting an empty car, he happily jumps in only to find that it's empty because of a bag left on a seat that is emitting a noxious vapor. He's trapped when the doors close before he can leave. Concluded in the final short. *\\"The Red Shoes\\" **Directed by Craig McKay, written by John Guare ***Starring Christine Lahti, Denis Leary, Kevin Corrigan, and N'Bushe Wright. An angry panhandler in a wheelchair enrages a woman by accidentally, then intentionally running over her red shoes while apathetic passengers watch. When she grabs his money and leaves, another woman turns passengers' opinions against him by claiming the two are working as a team to solicit sympathy and donations for him. Another bystander later confronts the second woman, who admits she was lying, but opinion turns against him as well. *\\"The 5:24\\" **Directed by Bob Balaban, written by Lynn Grossman ***Starring Steve Zahn and Jerry Stiller, this short follows the conversations between a wary young financial analyst and a seemingly brilliant, wise, older, and allegedly retired analyst who claims working in an office, though lucrative, would take the fun out his predictive abilities. When the older man proposes an investment that appears too good to be true, will the young analyst set aside his fears and gamble his savings on the older man's lucrative proposal? *\\"Fern's Heart of Darkness\\" **Directed by Patricia Benoit, written by Angela Todd, and based on a story by Kathryn Drury ***Fern (Bonnie Hunt) takes the subway to a friend's home on her first trip to the city, but her overconfidence, unfamiliarity with the system and fears and stereotypes about big city people leads her to become stuck in a locked turnstile in a station that's closed for the weekend. Non-speaking appearance by Mekhi Phifer. *\\"The Listeners\\" **Directed by Seth Rosenfeld, written by Ken Kelsch ***Starring Michael Rapaport and Lili Taylor, this short examines the age-old problem of communication in relationships when Belinda accuses her boyfriend of not listening to her. Her angry shift of location to another car, and brief conversation about politics with a suited older man, who seems at first to just be friendly, reveals that in the city, listening, hearing, and understanding are far more complicated, communal activities than one might have thought. *\\"Underground\\" **Directed by Lucas Platt, written by Albert Innaurato ***Starring Mercedes Ruehl as a sensual older woman with unusual appetites, this short asks and answers the question: what does a young man (Zachary Taylor) dumped by his girlfriend and beat up by her ex-boyfriend (Peter Sarsgaard) and his friends need to soothe his bruised face and ego? *\\"Honey-Getter\\" **Directed by Alison Maclean, written by Danny Hoch ***Nicole Ari Parker and Sarita Choudhury star in this short as Sharon and Humera, attractive law students heading home after a late night out. Tired and boarding the train alone, although it is far from empty, Humera is groped by an offensive young man (Ajay Naidu). His friend (Danny Hoch) chastises him after they run away but when she spots the pair on the platform, she exacts violent revenge on both, resulting in all three of them being arrested. *\\"Sax Cantor Riff\\" **Written and directed by Julie Dash ***Starring Taral Hicks, and with a brief appearance by Sam Rockwell, this short celebrates the unexpected musical gifts which the subway can give. In overlapping duets between a saxophone player (Kenny Garrett), accompanying first a gospel singer, and then a Jewish singer, one finds the subway to be an underground Carnegie Hall - whether the music is born of the grief wrought by experiencing the death of a parent in public, or produced by the heart-rending lament of a Hasidic man's (Dan Rous) unexpected emotional outpouring. *\\"Love on the A Train\\" **Directed by Abel Ferrara, written by Marla Hanson ***Starring Rosie Perez and Gretchen Mol, this humorous short follows a newly married man (Michael McGlone) who develops an utterly silent, distracting, sensual relationship with an attractive woman (Perez) on the subway. Although they never speak, they spend their morning commute lightly rubbing against each other, while appearing to only lean against a pole. He breaks his silence one day and she walks away in disgust. They eventually resume their wordless relationship. *\\"Manhattan Miracle\\" **Directed by Ted Demme, written by Joe Viola ***Gregory Hines as a man watching with growing concern and fear as a distressed pregnant woman (Anne Heche) across the tracks from him seems to consider jumping onto the tracks. Soundtrack of Vivaldi's Concerto for Cello in D Minor provides atmosphere. *\\"Subway Car From Hell\\" (part 2) **The man from the first segment arrives at his destination, adjacent to the 42nd Street Shuttle. He removes a didgeridoo from a case and begins performing with his fellow buskers.  Critical reaction  Subway Stories continues to be acclaimed by prominent critics and viewers alike.

The album is a compilation of songs from their first three albums, Ultravox!, Ha!-Ha!-Ha! and Systems of Romance, and therefore concentrates on the earlier incarnation of the band from the 1970s featuring John Foxx, as opposed to the more recognisable 1980s line-up which featured Midge Ure.

He is credited with creating a multi- faceted ethics-based curriculum now widely used in teaching real estate. Biography Born in Milwaukee in 1933, Graaskamp was the son of Arnold G. and Lillian (Haufe) Graaskamp. His grandfather, Garret William Graaskamp, was born in Sheboygan County, Wisconsin, and his grandmother, Lavina Risseeuw, was born in the Netherlands (Ancestry.com, James A. Graaskamp Family Tree, retrieved January 16, 2015). As happened to too many children of that era, Graaskamp contracted polio at the age of 17. The disease left him quadriplegic, with no sensation or control from the shoulders down. This forced him to abandon a football scholarship to Harvard and seek a warmer climate for a time. He earned a bachelor's degree in creative writing from Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida, then went on to earn a master‚Äôs of business administration in security analysis from Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and a doctorate in urban land economics and risk management from the University of Wisconsin. He began teaching real estate at the University of Wisconsin in 1964 and continued until his death in 1988 at the age of 54, as which time he was chair of the department. He was survived by his long-time companion, Jean Davis. Graaskamp's devotion to students and intellectual oratory earned him legions of loyal student followers. Graaskamp was a world traveler and determined to be as independent as possible. Every school year, he hired several students to live with him at his home on Breese Terrace, near Camp Randall, the University of Wisconsin football stadium. These students assisted Graaskamp with his personal care and traveled with him on his many journeys, including trips to Alaska, Hawaii, Europe and in pursuing his favorite pastime, deep sea fishing, for which he developed his own specialized tackle. Graaskamp was one of the first to discuss the concept of \\"affordable housing\\". He successfully showed that the prevailing government sentiment of the time that commercial properties offered higher tax yields and lower service demands created unnecessary barriers to build housing for those less well-off. His argument was that such housing is needed for both efficiency (workers live near work) and equity (everyone has a right to housing). He also took on the challenges between current residents and new residents and new development, a fight currently attributed to the NIMBY residents--\\"Not In My Back Yard\\". Graaskamp demonstrated that restrictive land use regulations can stagnate communities as new residents, businesses and development are shut out. Although Graaskamp refused to allow his personal health issues to restrict him, and indeed, many of his colleagues, friends and students completely forgot his disability, his limitations of necessity made him a pioneer in accessible real estate, far ahead of the ADA, projects on which he worked with friend and fellow professor, Mike McBurney. Contribution to real estate In the 1970s, he began to advocate for an environmental ethic in real estate proceedings, recognizing that development has considerable and nearly irreversible impacts on the land. He also believed in the need for a social component to real estate deals, appreciating that the rights of private and public property owners are inextricably linked. His theories meant a departure from typical real estate deals of mid-century, based on appraisals that reflected only narrow interests and were not always financially sound. Because any resulting failures hurt communities and small investors, Graaskamp began to advocate a much more comprehensive approach to feasibility analysis. His book, A Guide to Feasibility Analysis, is still used as a standard text today. During the savings & loan collapse of the 1990s, Graaskamp‚Äôs concerns were widely seen as vindicated. By the time of his death, Graaskamp had firmly established the preeminence of the UW Real Estate Department at the University of Wisconsin and nationally. Graaskamp emphasized a multi-disciplinary approach to the curriculum, moving it from a traditional finance emphasis and instead incorporating an eclectic mix of classes in behaviorism, physical science, and business administration. He believed in preparing students to tackle complex, unstructured problems that didn‚Äôt lend themselves to neat academic models. Today, the Graaskamp approach is commonplace in most real estate schools. Graaskamp did not shrink from becoming involved in local politics. In the mid-1980s in his home city of Madison, Wisconsin, he often inserted himself into major city/university discussions over the disposal of large downtown land tracts being vacated by railroad companies. In 1982, James Graaskamp was named a trustee of the Urban Land Institute (ULI), a nonprofit education and research institute that promotes responsible land use. In 2004, James Graaskamp was one of ten ‚Äúreal estate legends‚Äù profiled in a book published by ULI, ‚ÄúLeadership Legacies.‚Äù Of the ten, Graaskamp was the sole academic. The Urban Land Institute's textbook \\"Real Estate Development\\" now in its fifth addition is dedicated to Professor Graaskamp. As the intro states, he was \\"dynamic, insightful, slightly opinionated and one helluva guy\\". Recent developments In April 2007, the University of Wisconsin Center for Real Estate was officially renamed the James A. Graaskamp Center for Real Estate as part of a $20 million alumni-led fundraising campaign. The James Graaskamp Landmark Research Collection at the University of Wisconsin was made public on October 25, 2007. It contains over 165 consulting reports from Landmark completed between the late 1960s to the early 1990s. There are appraisals, market and feasibility studies as well as other types of research and analysis. The City of Madison named a park in Graaskamp's honor, James A. Graaskamp Park.

After only two league appearances he returned to Loughborough United, then signed for Southern League club Dunstable Town, for whom he scored 25 goals, and then Bedford Town, who sold him to Southend United in November 1969, for a fee of ¬£12,000. He scored 47 goals in 111 games for Southend, and was their top scorer and Player of the Season in 1971‚Äì72. After impressing during a League Cup match against Chelsea in 1972, he signed for the west Londoners three days later for ¬£100,000. Garner's time at Chelsea was hindered by the overall decline of the side, culminating in relegation to the Second Division in 1975, as well as his own injury problems and loss of form. He made a total of 119 appearances for Chelsea, scoring 36 goals. He signed for Cambridge United on a free transfer in 1978.
