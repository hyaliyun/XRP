Kemp, Jr. (born Darnell Freeman; December 24, 1956) is an American amateur wrestler who achieved unparalleled success at the high school, collegiate, and international levels. Kemp started wrestling in only the 9th grade at Chardon High School, in Chardon, Ohio and by the end of his high school career had compiled two undefeated seasons while winning two Ohio State titles in his last two seasons. His first state title included wins over the defending state champion and the previous years' state runnerup. Shortly after graduating from high school, Lee was one of only four American Junior wrestlers that recorded a dual meet win against a tough Junior Soviet team on their Ohio stop of an eight city United States tour, which resulted in 80 total matches being contested. Lee also won the prestigious Junior National Freestyle Tournament in July of that same year defeating a future 3-time NCAA Champion in the finals. While competing for the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison Lee Kemp was a four-time NCAA Division I National finalist, winning the championship three times and placing 2nd, on a split referee's decision, as a true freshman at 18 years old. Lee recorded losses to only three wrestlers in his collegiate career losing his last college match in the NCAA finals as a freshman, posting 110 wins and no losses against collegiate competition in his last three years, which included the historic win over the legendary Dan Gable in November of Lee's sophomore year, while he was still 18 years old. March 10, 2010 Inside Wisconsin Sports Article,\\"The Day Lee Kemp Beat the Great Dan Gable\\", by Mike Beacom. Kemp was America's first three-time World Champion, winning his first title in 1978 at age 21, establishing him as the youngest American world champion ever, a distinction he held for 30 years. Lee was a four-time World Cup Champion, 7-time United States Freestyle National Champion and was a heavy favorite for gold earning a berth on the 1980 United States Olympic Freestyle Wrestling Team, but was unable to compete because of the U.S. boycott of the Olympics. Kemp was inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum in 1990. Then at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, where he was one of the freestyle coaches for the U.S., he became just the fifth American to be inducted into the United World Wrestling (formerly known as FILA) Hall of Fame. Kemp is the subject of a film documentary, entitled Wrestled Away: The Lee Kemp Story, on his life scheduled for theatrical release Summer 2019, and is the co-founder and President of LKNutrition (formerly FORZA Technologies), a nutritional supplement company. LKNutrition (formerly FORZA) was the official corporate sponsor of USA Wrestling and its national teams. Early life Kemp was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to a single mother, who eventually put him up for adoption. He was adopted by Leroy Percy Kemp and his wife Jessie. Darnell was their only child and after the adoption they legally changed his name to Leroy P. Kemp, Jr. The Kemps lived in Cleveland until Leroy Jr. finished 6th grade, when they purchased a farm in Chardon, Ohio. Wrestling career=High school= As a freshman at Chardon high school, Kemp got involved in wrestling after being cut from the basketball team. He made the varsity as a sophomore for the 1972 season and finished with an 11-8-3 record. The next two seasons he was an Ohio State high school champion and finished undefeated in his junior and senior years. His first state title included wins over the defending state champion and the previous years' state runnerup. His career record in high school was 78-8-3. Prior to matriculating at the University of Wisconsin, Lee was one of only four American Junior wrestlers that recorded a dual meet win against a tough Junior Soviet team on their Ohio stop of an eight city United States tour (which resulted in 80 total matches being contested). Lee also won the Junior Freestyle Nationals in the summer of 1974. =College= Kemp started for Wisconsin as a true freshman and finished second at the Big Ten tournament at 150 pounds. He also reached the finals of the 1975 NCAA tournament and lost a split referees decision to Chuck Yagla of the University of Iowa. That was the last loss of Kemp's career. Kemp's only losses in his collegiate career were to three wrestlers in his freshman year. The following season, Kemp moved up a weight class to 158 pounds. Kemp won the NCAA title at 158 pounds the next three seasons and the only blemish on his record was a single tie finishing with 110 collegiate wins, which included the historic win over the legendary Dan Gable in November of Lee's sophomore year, while he was still 18 years old. March 10, 2010 Inside Wisconsin Sports Article,\\"The Day Lee Kemp Beat the Great Dan Gable\\", by Mike Beacom. He completed his college career with a record of 143-6-1 and 47 falls.

From 1922, there was a monthly paper for school-age children - √ötƒõcha (Solace), which appeared once per month to begin with, then only ten times per year from 1927 onwards. Production of this paper ceased when the Komensk√Ω association was dissolved in 1941. The Austrian Civil War hit those papers in particular that were close to the social democrats, while the Anschluss had consequences for all Czech and Slovak publications. Vienna‚Äôs Czechs were allowed to broadcast on the Austrian national radio just once during the First Republic. On 9 August 1933, Franti≈°ek Melichar was granted leave to address his countrymen and countrywomen during the programme Fremdenpropaganda (Foreign Propaganda).

Publishers and printers  The Druckerei Melantrich was founded in the Pramergasse in 1897. In 1922, it became a joint stock company. Around the same time, this publisher opened its own bookstore. Between World War I and World War II, the Druckerei Melantrich published works of both fiction and non-fiction; it also printed the newspapers of the Czech bourgeois political factions.K. M. Brousek: Wien und seine Tschechen ‚Äì Integration und Assimilation einer Minderheit im 20. Jahrhundert The Druckerei Melantrich changed its name to ‚ÄúHermes‚Äù, Druck- und Verlagsanstalt Aktiengesellschaft in October 1939, and over time it broadened the scope of its business to include the printing of maps, musical recordings and advertising. The firm existed until 1989.E. Kubu, G. Exner: Tschechen und Tschechinnen, Verm√∂gensentzug und Restitution, page 110 In 1908, politician and author Anton√≠n Mach√°t founded a printing press at Margaretenplatz (number 7) with the title Lidov√° knihtisk√°rna (People‚Äôs Book Printing Press). The associated publishing house V√≠de≈àsk√° knihovna was founded in the same year and published in particular the works of social democrats. 16 different newspapers and periodicals were being published here in 1925. The Danubius printer and publishing house was also controlled by social democrats. There were numerous smaller publishers that printed newspapers. Books published in Vienna were also sold in Czechoslovakia.  Libraries  The following Czech libraries existed in Vienna: (ref?) * Komensk√Ω and 'Svatopluk Cech' jointly owned a library in Landstra√üe * Sokol and the Akademick√Ω spolek (Academic's association) ran a library in Innere Stadt * The Czech social democrats had a library in Rudolfsheim-F√ºnfhaus * The associations Svatopluk Cech and Nova doba had libraries in Brigittenau The holdings of the district branches of the associations Maj, Barak and Komensk√Ω were also open to the public. Several sporting and tourist associations also owned relevant books and maps. The associations bought large quantities of books in Czechoslovakia in order to top up the holdings of these libraries and to keep them up-to-date; in 1930‚Äì31 for example, books to the value of more than 300,000 koruna were bought for this purpose. After the Komensk√Ω association was dissolved on 16 May 1942, its library was formally taken over by the Austrian National Library. The approximately 70,000 books in its holdings survived the war in storage at the National Library and were returned in 1950 after a claim was filed in 1948.E. Kubu, G.

Before that she was a prosecutor for the state for more than 11 years. She was elected to a four-year term as Solicitor (District Attorney) for the Tenth Judicial Circuit, serving 2000 to 2004. She has returned to private practice. Early life and education White earned her undergraduate degree at Furman University, and her J.D. degree at the University of South Carolina School of Law.  Career  After gaining her law degree, White served in the United States Marines Corps as a Judge Advocate General Corps (JAG) officer for a few years. She was hired as a state prosecutor. She served in this position for more than 11 years. In 1999, she was elected as Solicitor [District Attorney] for the Tenth Judicial Circuit, where she served a four-year term (2000‚Äì2004). During her time as prosecutor, White became one of the foremost experts on capital murder cases in the United States. She was invited to testify as an expert witness to the U.S. Senate Judiciary committee on June 10, 2002. She testified in the matter of ‚ÄúReducing the Risk of Executing the Innocent: The Report of the Illinois Governor's Commission on Capital Punishment‚Äù, along with other experts in the field, including author Scott Turow, Donald Hubert, and Professor Larry Marshall (Northwestern University School of Law). White taught the Career Prosecutors Course at the College of the National District Attorneys Association in Alexandria, Virginia, which is attended by prosecutors from around the country. = Stephanie Carter = Among White's notable trials as prosecutor was that known for its victim, Stephanie Carter, a four-year-old girl who died at the hands of her father and stepmother after suffering physical abuse for a year. After Carter's father pleaded guilty, White prosecuted her stepmother and won a conviction. White subsequently co- authored a state bill entitled \\"Stephanie's Law\\", to make it easier for law enforcement to protect children in South Carolina from abuse. Among other provisions, it requires classification of suspected child abuse cases immediately as \\"unfounded\\" or \\"indicated\\", and allows reopening of cases upon the receipt of additional information.  Defense Attorney  After losing a bid for re-election as Tenth Circuit Solicitor to challenger Chrissy Adams, White opened her own law practice. As a defense attorney, White has helped to gain acquittal in two cases of women accused of murder, arguing successfully that they had been acting in self-defense. = April McCullough = McCullough was charged with shooting and killing her 32-year-old boyfriend, Scotty Fowler, in February 2005. She claimed that he had had a history of committing domestic violence against her. The jury acquitted McCullough, convinced by White's argument that Fowler had abused her client and McCullough killed him in self-defense. = Cynthia Marchbanks = On September 8, 2006, 23-year-old Cynthia Marchbanks and 22-year-old Amber Robey, who were childhood friends, argued. Marchbanks fled to her home, and Robey charged in. Afraid, Marchbanks fired her .45 caliber pistol at Robey, killing her with a shot to the chin. Robey was 6 months pregnant and her baby was delivered early by emergency Caesarean section in an attempt to save it. The baby died 40 days later. White defended Marchbanks and won her acquittal of murder in a jury trial. She was believed to have killed her pregnant neighbor in self-defense, after an argument escalated.

Pannur village has contributed one bishop, and many number of priests and nuns to serve to humanity throughout the world in the fields of social work, hospital management and educational institution. Pannur is a 300-year-old village. Telugu-speaking community from Guntur district (Andhra Pradesh), migrated around 1700 AD and settled initially in Kilacheri (around 8 km from the village) and subsequently a group moved to Pannur. The Church of 'Our Lady Of Good Health', 150 years old, is located at the centre of the village. Pannur celebrates the festival of Our Lady Of Health on 31 May. There is an elementary school for boys and girls named after St. Annes, being managed by the Sisters of St. Annes. The Salesians of Don Bosco manage a school which was established as apostolic school and for the welfare of the poor children from nearby localities like anthoniyaar puram, susaipuram, pannur and other local villages which imparts Tamil- and English-medium education for children up to class 12th . Don Bosco higher secondary education school was established in Pannur in 1958, with the help of then village President Shri. Bashyam Jacob Naidu, a great Salesian priest Rev. Fr. Ittyatchan S.D., and the village parish priest Rev. Fr. D. Joseph D.D. The first SSLC batch passed out in 1962. Since 1953 Pannur was a landmark for the traders like groundnut, paddy, and ragi. The first rice mill in Pannur was the Bashyam rice mill, a Bashyam family mill managed by Shri. Bashyam Royappa Naidu, brother of Shri. Bashyam Jacob Naidu. Later, a second rice mill was established by Bashyam Balaiah Naidu along with Malapati Joseph Naidu(Father of Malapati Sebastian Naidu) and another rice mill called St.Joseph Modern Rice mill was established by shri. Malapati Sebastian naidu. These rice mills helped the villagers who had agruculture as their prime source of income. Many landlords such as Tharigopala Jaianna Naidu donated their lands for good cause and the church. In those days it was a very beautiful Telugu village and people all belonged to the same community. There was a relationship between each and everyone in the village where everyone was related to each other. Pannur is included in the list of suburb in Chennai (New Chennai) Pannur is located on the state highway connecting Thiruvallur and Kanchipuram and is 55 km from Chennai city.

Early life Otto Acron was born 12 May 1935 as Alexander James Alsop in Sydney, Australia to Lilly Elizabeth and James Gess Alsop. He had two brothers, Ken his older and Ian his younger brother. His father worked on the railways as a boilermaker. Otto recalls him being a \\"very big man, not all muscle, but with very impressive big arms\\". Otto liked to read Superman and Captain Marvel comics and was interested in the feats of strongmen and wrestlers from an early age. When he was 14 he suffered a severe injury during a friendly boxing match which damaged his brain and took years to heal. He became determined during recovery to train himself to be able to perform extraordinary physical feats.From his autobiography \\"Extraordinary\\", to be published Career as a circus strongman In 1955 he worked as a circus strongman on fairgrounds throughout New South Wales bending iron bars, breaking chains, getting run over by cars. He also worked in Roy Bell's, Jimmy Sharman's and Les McNabb's boxing tents taking on all comers. Otto Acron carrying a horse up the ladders In 1959 he approached Bullens Circus to work as a strongman. To get the job he had to carry a 1,000 lb (450 kg) horse up a 14 ft (4.3 m) ladder (a feat performed earlier by South African strongman William Pagel). This became one of his signature stunts, performed over 2,000 times in his career. He also became known for holding at bay two lorries, one with each arm and for having two elephants attempting to move him from the centre of the ring.Boswell Brother's 1961 press release In 1961 he joined Boswell Brother's Circus in South Africa. In December 1962 he wrestled for Dale Martin Promotions, wrestling all over England. In the summer of 1962 he worked for Circus Arnardo in Norway and returned to England, where he wrestled during the winter season. In the summer of 1963 he went and worked for Circus Toni Boltini in the Netherlands. He was married there and continued working in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany. Career as a modern strongman In August 1971 Otto Acron took on two aeroplanes in a tug of war at Rotterdam Airport. This was the first time he had performed this stunt that he would later perform with increasingly strong planes.Front page news in the 19 August 1971 issue of the Haagsche CourantThe Sydney Morning Herald, 14 June 1976 (a later performance with Piper Twin Comanches)Fraser Coast Chronicle, Saturday, 21 June 1997 (a later performance with Air Fraser Island 300 hp Cessnas) Winning the 1985 Mr. Australia championship In 1984 he entered many physique competitions, winning the masters: Mr. Sydney, Mr. Australia., Mr. Oceania, Mr. Southern Hemisphere. In 1984 and 1985, he entered power lifting competitions in the masters division, and became state champion and Australian champion for the 82.5 kg class. In 1992 he came seventh in the world power lifting contest. Later career In 1995 he left Sydney and took his family to Hervey Bay in Queensland where he started a gym called Otto's Fitness World. In 2005, at the age of seventy he did 1125 push ups in half an hour to raise money for a young boy who needed a motorised wheel chair.The Fraser Coast Chronicle Saturday, 9 April 2005 On 14 November 2000, he was awarded the Australian Sports Medal.

As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye.  Tail formation  A comet's orbit showing the different directions of the gas and dust tails as the comet passes the Sun In the outer Solar System, comets remain frozen and are extremely difficult or impossible to detect from Earth due to their small size. Statistical detections of inactive comet nuclei in the Kuiper belt have been reported from the Hubble Space Telescope observations, but these detections have been questioned, and have not yet been independently confirmed. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. The streams of dust and gas thus released form a huge, extremely tenuous atmosphere around the comet called the coma, and the force exerted on the coma by the Sun's radiation pressure and solar wind cause an enormous tail to form, which points away from the Sun. The streams of dust and gas each form their own distinct tail, pointing in slightly different directions. The tail of dust is left behind in the comet's orbit in such a manner that it often forms a curved tail called the antitail, only when it seems that it is directed towards the Sun. At the same time, the ion tail, made of gases, always points along the streamlines of the solar wind as it is strongly affected by the magnetic field of the plasma of the solar wind. The ion tail follows the magnetic field lines rather than an orbital trajectory. Parallax viewing from the Earth may sometimes mean the tails appear to point in opposite directions.  Size  While the solid nucleus of comets is generally less than 30 km across, the coma may be larger than the Sun, and ion tails have been observed to extend . The Ulysses spacecraft made an unexpected pass through the tail of the comet C/2006 P1 (Comet McNaught), on February 3, 2007. Evidence of the encounter was published in the October 1, 2007, issue of The Astrophysical Journal.  Magnetosphere  The observation of antitails contributed significantly to the discovery of solar wind. The ion tail is the result of ultraviolet radiation ejecting electrons off particles in the coma. Once the particles have been ionised, they form a plasma which in turn induces a magnetosphere around the comet. The comet and its induced magnetic field form an obstacle to outward flowing solar wind particles. The comet is supersonic relative to the solar wind, so a bow shock is formed upstream of the comet (i.e. facing the Sun), in the flow direction of the solar wind. In this bow shock, large concentrations of cometary ions (called \\"pick-up ions\\") congregate and act to \\"load\\" the solar magnetic field with plasma. The field lines \\"drape\\" around the comet forming the ion tail. (This is similar to the formation of planetary magnetospheres.)  Tail loss  Comet Encke loses its tail If the ion tail loading is sufficient, then the magnetic field lines are squeezed together to the point where, at some distance along the ion tail, magnetic reconnection occurs. This leads to a \\"tail disconnection event\\". This has been observed on a number of occasions, notable among which was on the 20th. April 2007 when the ion tail of comet Encke was completely severed as the comet passed through a coronal mass ejection. This event was observed by the STEREO spacecraft. A disconnection event was also seen with C/2009 R1 (McNaught) on May 26, 2010.  Analogues  On January 29, 2013, ESA scientists reported that the ionosphere of the planet Venus streams outwards in a manner similar to \\"the ion tail seen streaming from a comet under similar conditions.\\"  References  External links  Comets page at NASA's Solar System Exploration * International Comet Quarterly at Harvard.edu Comets Articles containing video clips ","title":"Comet tail"},{"id":"23775184","text":"Wild Heather is a 1921 British drama film directed by Cecil Hepworth and starring Chrissie White, Gerald Ames, James Carew and George Dewhurst.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327249/ It was based on the 1917 play Wild Heather by Dorothy Brandon.BFI.org Cast *Chrissie White as \\"Wild Heather\\" Boyd *G.H.

It was built on land within the Port of Richborough but being on the northern edge its site lies mostly within the neighbouring parish of Minster, Kent. It operated from 1962 to 1996; the towers were demolished on 11 March 2012. BFL Management Ltd, the current owners of the site plan to bring it back into use as the ¬£750 million Richborough Energy Park. History The Central Electricity Generating Board started construction of the power station in 1958, with Unit 1 coming online in December 1962, and Unit 2 following in August 1963. It opened as a 336 MW coal-fired station, using coal from East Kent coalfield and elsewhere. The maximum total steam capacity of the station boilers was 2,580,000 lb/hr (325 kg/s). Steam pressure and temperature at the turbine stop valves was 1500 psi (103.4 bar) and 538¬∞C.CEGB Statistical Yearbooks (various years, 1964-87). CEGB, London From 1964-72 Richborough was one of the CEGB‚Äôs twenty stations with the highest thermal efficiencies. The thermal efficiency was 30.88 % (1964); 32.84% (1965); 33.83% (1966); 33.82% (1967); 32.9% (1968); 32.26% (1969); 32.62% (1970); 32.31% (1971); 32.03% (1972). It was converted to burn oil in summer 1971 and further converted in 1989 to burn a proprietary oil and water emulsion called Orimulsion, imported from Venezuela through Port Richborough. The site was also chosen as the site for an experimental 1 MW wind turbine, which was at that time the largest ever installed in the UK, with permission given in 1987, and the turbine becoming live in 1989. After growing concerns over the environmental effects of the Orimulsion fuel in the main power station, court action was taken in two separate actions, with both cases settled out of court. One of the turbo-alternators was decommissioned in 1984, this reduced the output capability to 228 MW.

Demolition The three cooling towers and chimney of Richborough power station, prior to demolition View inside one of the cooling towers Following the plant closure, the majority of the equipment was removed during a strip out programme, which also saw the demolition of a number of the buildings, leaving only a few outbuildings, the office block and the landmark cooling towers and chimney standing. In controlled blasts, the three 97m cooling towers and a single 127m chimney stack were demolished at 9:07am on 11 March 2012. Some locals had campaigned to keep the towers, saying they formed part of the historical landscape and were used as a navigation point by boats wanting to enter the mouth of the River Stour, known to have a narrow channel of useful depth. The turbine hall was the last part of the power station to be demolished in 2016. Future The current owner of the site, BFL Management Ltd, plan to bring the site back into use as a ¬£750 million green energy park. The national grid interconnector from the original power station is still in place, and is now the grid link for the offshore Thanet Wind Farm. There are additional plans to create additional recycling and green energy facilities on site, including an anaerobic digester, a waste processing plant, a biomass combined heat and power generator, a pyrolysis plant and a peak demand 30MW diesel generator. When fully operational, the park could provide up to 1,400MW of power, employing 100 full-time equivalent, with up to 500 jobs in the construction phase. National Grid plans to use part of the site for a new interconnector with Belgium. A 1000MW High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) 130 km undersea link with the Belgium transmission operator, Elia, would allow power to flow in both directions. This would be the third link from the UK National Grid to Europe, the others being the Britned 1000MW link to the Netherlands commissioned in 2011 and the IFA 2000MW link to France commissioned in 1986. The link should be in operation in 2018. In popular culture The power station can be seen in several scenes of the 2008 film Son of Rambow, and was the location for the 2003 Channel 4 television series Full Metal Challenge. More recently a brief clip of the demolition of the cooling towers was used by Alter Bridge in their official music video for 'Addicted to Pain' off their 2013 album Fortress.

A long-time member of the Red Army, Nedelin was a veteran of numerous wars and was honored as a Hero of the Soviet Union for his service during the Second World War. On 8 May 1959, Nedelin was promoted to Chief Marshal of the Artillery, and became an important figure in the development of ICBMs and the Space Race. On 24 October1960, Nedelin was killed in an explosion at Baikonur Cosmodrome during the eponymous Nedelin catastrophe.  Early life  Mitrofan Ivanovich Nedelin was born on November 9, 1902, in Borisoglebsk, Voronezh Governorate, Russian Empire.  Military career  Nedelin joined the Red Army in 1920, aged 18, and fought as a volunteer in the Russian Civil War until its conclusion in 1923. The following year he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and was conscripted back into the Red Army, becoming an artillery commander.Memoirs of Nikita Khrushchev, Volume 2, Reformer 1945-64, by Nikita Sergeevich Khrushchev and Sergeƒ≠ Khrushchev, pub Penn State Press, 2006, , p817. From 1937 to 1939, Nedelin fought in the Spanish Civil War as a foreign volunteer for the Republican Government, and the same year was appointed to command 13th Artillery Regiment in the Soviet Red Army.The Generals of WWII ‚Äì Nedelin In 1940 he was appointed to command the artillery of 160th Rifle Division after returning from Spain, and participated in the Winter War until 1940. In 1941, after the Soviet Union entered World War Two, Nedelin was appointed commander of first 4th Anti-Tank Brigade, then the artillery of 18th Army, and then the artillery of 37th Army where he stayed until 1943, before being moved to command the artillery of 56th Army. In 1943, he was appointed Deputy Commanding Officer of the artillery of the Northern Caucasian Front. From there Nedelin moved to command the V Artillery Corps, and then the artillery of the south-western front, and then the artillery of the 3rd Ukrainian Front where he stayed from 1943 to 1945, playing an especially important part in the capture of Hungary. In 1945, Nedelin became assistant commanding officer and then the commanding officer of the artillery of the Soviet Southern Group of Forces. In 1946, after the end of the Second World War, Nedelin became chief of staff of the chief artillery directorate of the Soviet Army, and then chief of staff of artillery, and then deputy commander in chief of artillery. In 1948, he became head of the chief artillery directorate of the Soviet Army before becoming commander in chief of artillery from 1950 to 1952, and after a brief period as Deputy Minister of War, returned as commander in chief of artillery from 1953 to 1955. From 1955, he was Deputy Minister of Defence, and concurrently from 1959 commander in chief of the Strategic Missile Force.  Space  During the Cold War, Nedelin inadvertently played a key role in ushering in the Space Age by concluding that rockets were the ideal means to deliver a nuclear warhead to the United States instead of bombers, and ordered Sergei Korolev to develop the massive R-7 ICBM capable of carrying a large warhead to the United States. This rocket and its derivatives, while never an effective ICBM, was powerful enough to launch Sputnik, the world's first artificial Earth satellite, and then Vostok manned space vehicles into orbit. These accomplishment allowed the Soviet Union to beat the United States on being the first nation to enter space, and taking a leading position during the early Space Race.  Death  On 24 October 1960, Nedelin, along with approximately 120 other individuals, were killed in a test rocket explosion at Baikonur Cosmodrome. The incident became known as the Nedelin catastrophe, named after Nedelin due to being its most notable victim, and was covered up by the authorities. Nedelin foolishly assured his team that all was safe, and to prove that he purposely sat close to the launch site; this decision cost him his life. Nedelin's death was officially listed as having occurred in a plane crash until the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s uncovered the incident. Nedelin was buried in a tomb in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis at Red Square in Moscow.

It states that, all short-ranged spherically symmetric pair-wise additive attractive potentials are characterised by the same thermodynamics properties if compared at the same reduced density and second virial coefficient Description Johannes Diderik van der Waals's law of corresponding states expresses the fact that there are basic similarities in the thermodynamic properties of all simple gases. Its essential feature is that if we scale the thermodynamic variables that describe an equation of state (temperature, pressure, and volume) with respect to their values at the liquid-gas critical point, all simple fluids obey the same reduced equation of state. Massimo G. Noro and Daan Frenkel formulated an extended law of corresponding states that predicts the phase behaviour of short-ranged potentials on the basis of the effective pair potential alone ‚Äì extending the validity of the van der Waals law to systems interacting through pair potentials with different functional forms. The Noro‚ÄìFrenkel law suggests to condensate the three quantities which are expected to play a role in the thermodynamics behavior of a system (hard-core size, interaction energy and range) into a combination of only two quantities: an effective hard core diameter and the reduced second virial coefficient. Noro and Frenkel suggested to determine the effective hard core diameter following the expression suggested by Barker based on the separation of the potential into attractive Vatt and repulsive Vrep parts used in the Weeks‚ÄìChandler‚Äì Andersen method. The reduced second virial coefficient, i.e., the second virial coefficient B2 divided by the second virial coefficient of hard spheres with the effective diameter can be calculated (or experimentally measured) once the potential is known. B2 is defined as :B_2=2\\\\pi\\\\int_0^\\\\infty r^2\\\\left[ 1-e^{-V(r)/k_\\\\text{B}T} \\\\right] dr Applications The Noro‚ÄìFrenkel law is particularly useful for the description of colloidal and globular protein solutions, for which the range of the potential is indeed significantly smaller than the particle size. For these systems the thermodynamic properties can be re-written as a function of only two parameters, the reduced density (using the effective diameter as length scale) and the reduced second-virial coefficient B. The gas-liquid critical point of all systems satisfying the extended law of corresponding states are characterized by same values of B at the critical point. The Noro-Frenkel law can be generalized to particles with limited valency (i.e. to non spherical interactions). Particles interacting with different potential ranges but identical valence behave again according to the generalized law, but with a different value for each valence of B at the critical point.

It was Australia's first uranium mine, years before the country's next major mines at Rum Jungle in the Northern Territory (opened in 1950), and the Mary Kathleen mine in Queensland (1958). The associated settlement which once housed up to 1,100 people is now a ghost town, largely abandoned and demolished. The former townsite and cemetery were provisionally listed on the South Australian Heritage Register on 24 August 2016. During its main period of production between 1954 and 1961 the mine produced nearly 1 million tonnes of davidite-bearing ore to produce about 860 tons of U3O8. History The site was first pegged for mining in 1906 after prospector Arthur John Smith inadvertently discovered a radioactive material at a location approximately East South East of Olary. Smith mistook the dark coloured ore he found for tin oxide or wolfram (tungsten). His samples were sent to Adelaide University where young Sydney geologist and future Antarctic explorer, Douglas Mawson found the ore to contain radium and uranium. It also had traces of ilmenite, rutile, magnetite, hematite, pyrite, chalcopyrite intergrown with quartz and biotite, chromium, vanadium, and molybdenum. Mawson named the uranium-bearing mineral davidite after geologist and Antarctic explorer, Sir Edgeworth David. The mine was initially called \\"Smith's Carnotite Mine\\" (a similar uranium- bearing mineral) and in September 1906 Mawson proposed the name \\"Radium Hill\\".Transactions of the Royal Society of South Australia, V.30 1906 Smith worked the mine for the next two years before allowing the lease to lapse. Adjoining leases stretched for along the lode, with one being half-owned by Mawson. Share certificate dated 1913 issued by the Radium Hill Company The Radium Hill Company took over the lease in 1908 and more shafts were sunk. Ore concentrate was transferred to refineries in New South Wales and Victoria. Radium had reached a price of ¬£13,000 per gram in 1911,Radium was discovered in 1898 by Marie Curie and she extracted the first pure metallic form of the element in 1908. and in the same year, at a cost of ¬£15,000 the company built a refinery at Hunter's Hill in New South Wales to produce radium compounds. 350 milligrams of radium bromide (RaBr2) and 150 kg of uranium were produced. The radium bromide was used for research in the emerging fields of radiation and radioactivity and some of the Hunter's Hill radium was sold to pioneering nuclear researchers Ernest Rutherford and Marie Curie. Mining ceased in 1914 and the Hunters Hill refinery closed the following year. The mine's second phase of operations started in 1923 when it was operated by the Radium and Rare Earth Treatment Company N.L. which continued operations there until 1931. The company also built a treatment plant in 1923 at Dry Creek near Adelaide to produce radium bromide for medical applications from the Radium Hill ore, however this proved to be uneconomic and both sites had ceased operations by 1932. Activity recommenced after World War II, with a Department of Mines geological survey in 1944 and exploration and drilling work done in 1946‚Äì1947. In March 1952 the Commonwealth and the South Australian governments signed a cost plus uranium supply contract with the UK-USA Combined Development Agency, initially for defence purposes, for delivery over seven years. A section of Maldorkey Station was annexed and proclaimed a \\"Uranium mining reserve\\" in 1954 and the mine was officially opened by the Governor General of Australia, Field Marshal Sir William Slim on 10 November the same year. The state government operated the mine and installed various infrastructure to support the operations. An spur line connecting the site to the main Broken Hill railway line at Cutana Siding was built in 1954. An aerodrome was constructed and roads improved in the same period. The town to house mine workers and their families was built also. This included 145 houses: in 1961 a population of 867 was recorded. Other town facilities included a hospital, school, government retail store, canteens, swimming pool, a bus service to Broken Hill and recreation and commercial facilities. The main shaft of the mine was deep with a headframe. Ore was crushed at a ball mill and treated on site at a surface concentrate mill using a heavy media separation and flotation process. It was then rail-freighted to the purpose-built Port Pirie Uranium Treatment Complex which processed ore from Radium Hill and Myponga (Wild Dog Hill), south of Adelaide. The Port Pirie complex was also operated by the state government. The mine output was 970,000 tonnes of 0.09-0.13% ore and the ore concentrate produced a mix of about 150,000 tonnes of yellowcake which was then processed at Port Pirie where it was subjected to hot acid leaching, producing about 860 tons of U3O8 worth more than ¬£15 million. After seven years of operations, the contract was filled and the plant officially decommissioned on 21 December 1961. Site rehabilitation Restoration works on the site were undertaken in 1962 and again in 1981 when the tailings impoundment was covered with about 75,000 m3 of material from four adjacent borrow pits. Backfilling of old mine openings was also undertaken. Radioactive waste repository From 1981 an area of the site was gazetted as a low-level radioactive waste repository. Approximately 16 separate consignments of waste, including contaminated soil from Thebarton in the Adelaide metropolitan area was deposited there. The last deposit was made in 1998. A New South Wales government study in 1979 found the incidence of cancer-related deaths by former Radium Hill workers to be four times the national average. According to the report, 59% of underground miners who had worked there for a period of two years or more had died of cancer. The site has been inactive since 1998. The Resources Division of Minerals and Energy at the Department of Primary Industry and Resources maintains management responsibility including a radiological watch on the site.

He was born in Oradea (Nagyv√°rad), Romania and his mother tongue is Hungarian.  Literary scholarship  In his doctoral dissertation (Sussex University, 1971) Tsur developed an approach which he later called \\"Cognitive Poetics\\". This is an interdisciplinary approach that combines literary theory, linguistics, psychology, and philosophy. It explores the relationship between the structure of the text and the human qualities perceived in it, and the mediating processes that take place in the reader's mind. He applied Cognitive Poetics to rhyme, sound symbolism, poetic rhythm, metaphor, poetry and altered states of consciousness, period style, genre, archetypal patterns, translation theory, the implied critic's decision style, critical competence and literary history. In his books and articles he applied his theories to English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Spanish, and Hebrew poetry, ranging from the Bible, through the eleventh, sixteenth and seventeenth century, to the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth century. His theory of metaphor has two facets: the creation and understanding of novel meanings (based on the \\"controversion\\" and \\"feature deletion\\" theories), and perceived qualities. In his criticism of George Lakoff's claim that a road mentioned in a poem must be interpreted in light of the \\"life is a journey\\" conceptual metaphor he argued that in various works \\"road\\" may assume an indefinite number of unforeseen meanings (one of which may be \\"life is a journey\\").See \\"Lakoff's Roads not Taken\\" in Bibliography. In his study of poetic rhythm he argues that no rules of metre have yet been devised that have not been violated by John Milton and Percy Bysshe Shelley, who are usually regarded as exceptionally musical poets. This required to shift the focus of investigation from what deviations are permissible in metrics to the question whether a performance can be imagined or secured in which the conflicting patterns of language and versification can be perceived at the same time. He has developed a theory that enables him to investigate the auditory information that affects the reader's or listener's impression (\\"what our ears tell our mind\\"). This theory includes a theory of rhythmical performance, submitting recorded readings to an instrumental analysis. For his work in Cognitive Poetics and poetic rhythm Tsur was awarded the 2009 Israel Prize in general literature. In its reasons, the Prize committee states that \\"he is one of the outstanding, internationally renowned scholars of literature in Israel, who has the reputation of an exceptionally original researcher and theoretician of literature\\".

He represents the 10th Senatorial District, which includes the Queens neighborhoods of Richmond Hill, South Ozone Park, Jamaica, Rochdale Village, Rosedale and parts of Far Rockaway. Early life and education Sanders was born at the Hammel Houses in Far Rockaway. He attended public schools throughout the Rockaways then attended Brooklyn College. Sanders served as a Marine. Career In 2002, Sanders won his seat in an underdog win against powerful candidates James Blake and Charlotte Jefferson. Blake had received the support of incumbent councilwoman Juanita Watkins. On the council, Sanders was the first African-American to sit as Chair of the Economic Development Committee'. In July 2009, Sanders was reported to have shown up for only 61% of City Council meetings for fiscal year 2009, the second-fewest on the list. However, he has attributed this to the near fatal car crash that he had in the fall of 2008 which also injured his staffers, Donovan Richards and Mike Duvall. In 2009, he was challenged for reelection from candidates Michael Duncan, Jacques Leandre, and Frederick Lewis.. boropolitics.com He was re-elected with 40% of the vote, with his next leading opponent, Jacques Leandre, receiving 19%.NY1 Online: 2009 New York City Primary Returns . NY1.com. Retrieved on 2012-05-15. His council seat is now held by his former District Manager Donovan Richards. In early 2007, Sanders endorsed then-Senator Barack Obama for President and traveled to Pennsylvania, Ohio, and South Carolina to campaign for him. He became an Obama delegate and represented his district at the Democratic National Convention in Denver. In 2015, Sanders endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for President of the United States in the 2016 Democratic primaries and the 2016 general election. He endorsed Bernie Sanders again for the 2020 Primary. = New York Senate = In 2012, Sanders, who would have been term-limited in the City Council and unable to run again in 2013, opted to primary Senator Shirley Huntley, who was facing corruption charges. He would go on to win with 56% of the vote, winning the general election unopposed. He has been unopposed in the general election ever since. In December 2015, Sanders filed papers to challenge Congressman Gregory Meeks in the Democratic primary for New York's 5th congressional district. However, he dropped out of the race in March 2016, accusing Meeks of leaking information to the New York Post about a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into Sanders' use of slush funds and alleged solicitation of a $250,000 kickback from a non-profit. Sanders was never charged with any wrongdoing, and he successfully ran for reelection to his Senate seat despite the Queens Democratic Party backing an opponent, Adrienne Adams. When Democrats took control of the state Senate in 2019, Sanders was named Chairman on the Committee on Banks. In 2019, Sanders introduced a resolution to recognize October 1, the National Day of the People's Republic of China, as \\"China Day\\" in New York State. The resolution in the state senate was attended by China's counsel general for New York State, Huang Ping, who praised it. Personal life In 2005, he married his former chief of staff. He has two children from a previous marriage.

Massa is a 1626 painting by Frans Hals that is in the collection of the Art Gallery of Ontario. It depicts Isaac Massa, a prosperous merchant and a close friend of Hals. Massa was the subject of an earlier work by Hals ‚Äì Isaak Abrahamsz Massa and Beatrix van der Lean ‚Äì which also featured his wife. Massa would commission another portrait by Hals in 1635. The painting is inscribed with the date 1626, but there is no mention of the identity of the sitter. For many years this led to debate, and it was often assumed to be a self-portrait. Wilhelm Valentiner was a noted proponent of this theory. Other scholars, such as Numa S. Trivas, did advance the idea that it was a portrait of Massa, and this was confirmed by the discovery of an inscription on a 17th-century engraving. The 1626 portrait is noted for its informality and vitality. Massa appears leaning over the back of a chair, a significant departure from standard formal portrait poses of the period. Hals would later use similar poses in a number of other paintings, and it would also be employed by other artists in later centuries.Francis Russell \\"Addenda to Wright of Derby: Two Boston Sitters and an Eton Leaving Portrait.\\" The Burlington Magazine. Vol. 143, No. 1181 (Aug., 2001)pg. 490 Massa's expression is candid, distracted. He is relaxed and engaged in his own affairs. Hals's brush strokes too are quick and free instead of smooth and controlled, which not only contributes to Hals's distinct style but also allowed him to complete an entire painting in one sitting, which accounts for the high volume he produced in his lifetime. Many of Hals's contemporaries were students of Caravaggio, influenced by his strong chiaroscuro. Though Hals may also have looked to Caravaggio his use of light is even, but Hals still manages to create bold highlights of Massa's facial features ‚Äì the right side of his face is illuminated while the left falls into a natural shadow. Massa had made his fortune as a silk merchant in Russia, and was a noted expert on the country. The view through the window of large coniferous trees may be intended to reflect this, it being a scene of Muscovy where much of Massa's trading was conducted. The landscape in the background may have not been painted by Hals, perhaps being the work of noted landscape artist Pieter de Molijn.Art Gallery of Ontario: Selected Works. Art Gallery of Ontario, 1990 pg. 88 In Massa's hand he holds a sprig of holly. In traditional symbolism this represents friendship and constancy, and may reflect the close relationship between the artist and subject. It has also been interpreted as Massa's pledge to be faithful to his wife during his long absences. For many years the painting was part of the collection of the Earls of Spencer. The 1822 Bibliotheca Spenceriana, a catalogue of the Spencer collection, describes it as hanging in one of the bedrooms of the estate.Thomas Frognall Dibdin and George John Spencer Spencer. Bibliotheca Spenceriana Printed for the author, by W. Bulmer and Co., Shakspeare Preee, and published by Longman, Hurst, Rees, and Co., T. Payne, White and Cochrane, John Murray, and J. & A. Arch, 1822. pg. 274 In 1924 the 7th Earl Spencer was forced to sell off part of the family collection to pay down debts. He sold the Hals, along with other works to art merchant Joseph Duveen. The next year Duveen sold the painting to Canadian businessman Frank P. Wood.Meryle Secrest. Duveen: a Life in Art. University of Chicago Press, 2004 Upon Wood's death in 1955 his collection was given to the Art Gallery of Ontario, which is where the portrait still resides. In 1959 the painting was stolen from the gallery, along with five other masterworks. The insurance company agreed to pay a ransom for the stolen pictures, and three weeks after disappearing the painting was recovered from a storage room in Parkdale. It had sustained only slight damage.Hugh McLeave Rogues in the Gallery: The Modern Plague of Art Thefts C&M; Online Media, Inc.

Slaughter has written a note to her readers about her decision, which is posted on her website.  Book summary  The Heartsdale Children's Clinic is closed. Sara spends all day being deposed in a malpractice lawsuit filed by the parents of Jimmy Powell, now dead from leukemia, and a deep-pockets-picking lawyer, over a ridiculous technicality. Everything she's built up for the last 16 years is crumbling away as greedy townspeople line up to get in on the action, not realizing their betrayal of her is only going to result in higher healthcare costs for everyone or that the nearest pediatrician is 100 miles away. Sara's parents are gone on a cross-country RV trip and her sister is counseling the homeless in Atlanta, only old/new husband Jeffrey is there for support. When he's called away to the town of Reese, it's almost a relief to get to go with him...except that they're going because Lena lies in a hospital with smoke inhalation, under arrest and suspected of being involved in murder. She was found beaten badly, watching a torched SUV burn with a body inside it, on the 50-yard line of the high school football field, foot propped on an empty gas can. And she won't say a word to anyone. Reese is Lena's home town, and she came back to check on her Uncle Hank, the ex-addict who raised her and her twin sister. She found him mixed up with some very unsavory characters and hooked on drugs again after being clean for three decades. And major events from her past are now in question, events that shaped who she is. One of the few things of which she is certain is that Jeffrey and Sara are in terrible danger, and she must stop at nothing to get them out of town.

It was on the Weedon to Leamington Spa branch line. The station opened on 1 March 1888 when a branch from the main line at Weedon reached the town. This line was extended in 1895 to reach Leamington Spa. The station was located to the east of the town centre, and was made mostly from wood. It was on a passing loop and had two platforms linked by a footbridge. The main station building was located on the down (westbound) platform, with a small waiting room on the up platform. The station was closed to passengers on 15 September 1958, however the line remained open for freight until 2 December 1963. Nothing now remains of the station. It was demolished in January 1968, and the A425 Daventry bypass built over the site. However some of the former trackbed to the north of the station remains in use as a footpath and cycleway.

Description The Soap Myth dramatizes the powerful confrontation between survivor memory and historical memory and depicts the insidiousness of anti-Semitism masquerading as Holocaust denial. More than a half century after World War II, a friendship develops between a young journalist and a cantankerous Holocaust survivor on a crusade to have the Nazi atrocity of \\"soap\\" displayed in Holocaust museums - did the Nazis make soap from the corpses of their murdered Jewish victims? This critically acclaimed play grapples with several provocative themes including Who has the right to write history?and How does a survivor survive surviving? Although The Soap Myth is a work of fiction, it is, in the words of the program, \\"inspired by real people and real events as well as an article written by Josh Rolnick in Moment magazine profiling Holocaust survivor Morris Spitzer.\\"Program, Dog Run Rep, South Street Seaport Foremost among the play's historical inspirations is the evidence that the Nazi regime had a program at the Danzig Anatomic Institute in 1944 to develop a process for the mass-production of soap from the fat of Jews being slaughtered in Nazi extermination camps, and produced soap in small quantities at a nearby concentration camp. In a dramatic moment, the players re-enact testimony from the Nuremberg Trials, including this recipe: > 5 kilos of human fat are mixed with 10 liters of water and 500 or 1,000 > grams of caustic soda. All this is boiled 2 or 3 hours and then cooled. The > soap floats to the surface while the water and other sediment remain at the > bottom. A bit of salt and soda is added to this mixture. Then fresh water is > added and the mixture again boiled 2 or 3 hours. After having cooled, the > soap is poured into molds.\\" The play's central character, is an elderly Holocaust survivor called Milton Saltzman, worked doggedly to establish as fact the idea that the Nazis produced and used soap made from human corpses, even handing bars of such soap to Jews on their way into the sealed chambers that functioned alternately as gas chambers and as shower rooms in the Nazi concentration camps.False Witness; A play examines the notion that Nazis made soap from Jewish flesh, MARISSA BROSTOFF, July 21, 2009, Tablet Magazine The second character is a young journalist called Annie Blumberg assigned to write a story about Saltzman. She is soon caught between her sympathies for Saltzman and the adamant stand of a number of distinguished scholars of the Holocaust who refuse to publish the Nazi manufacture of soap as fact despite a large amount of eyewitness testimony, including the eyewitness testimony of both Nazis and British prisoners of war at the Nuremberg trial who worked in the experimental soap manufacturing facility at Danzig in 1944, because contemporary documentation is lacking. The scholars in the play fear that without proof beyond the eyewitness testimony, the story of the manufacture of soap from human bodies will become ammunition in the hands of Holocaust deniers. Two characters representing historians of the Holocaust argue strongly that although a large number of eyewitnesses including former British POWs, Nazis, and Holocaust survivors have testified about the soap production, because no actual laboratory or production records survive as physical documents, any publication about the production of soap will be used by Holocaust deniers to discredit the reality of the Holocaust itself and, therefore, that no assertions that any soap production took place should be published. A character called Brenda Goodsen, an amalgam of a number of Holocaust deniers including David Irving, appears in the play to demonstrate the evil of anti- Semitism in the form of Holocaust Denial. This character delivers a speech for minimizing the Holocaust and concluding that the Jews brought it on themselves. Historical references Holocaust historian Robert Melvin Spector concludes that the Nazis \\"did indeed use human fat for the making of soap at Stutthof,\\" albeit in limited quantity.World without civilization: mass murder and the Holocaust, history and analysis, Robert Melvin Spector, University Press of America, 2004, p. 392. The material in the Nuremberg Trial scenes in the play use as dialogue actual testimony given by British prisoners of war and by Nazis at the historical trials about the development of an industrial process for producing soap from human bodies at the Danzig Anatomic Institute, the production of such soap on a small-scale basis at Stutthof concentration camp, and the actual use of this soap by Nazi personnel.Justice at Nuremberg, Robert E.

The first received a workshop production at South Street Seaport in July 2009. The New York Times called the play a \\"pointed investigation of the politics of history.\\"Where Political Agendas and History Intersect, New York Times, Jason Zinoman, July 21, 2009 Time Out New York wrote that the play \\"touches on a host of compelling issues: irrefutable versus empirical evidence, the subjective shaping of history, institutional agendas and, in its most effective scene, the potential seduction of anti-Semitism.\\" But criticized the play's faulty dramaturgy.The Soap Myth, Time Out New York NYTheater.com, praised its \\"...dazzling objectivity and even-handedness\\" and \\"real moral heft...\\"The Soap Myth, Martin Denton ¬∑ July 11, 2009 The Villager found it compelling, \\"There are certain movies, plays, books that one wishes would never end. For me, The Soap Myth is one of those extraordinary plays.\\" Following the workshop production, the play was substantially rewritten and subsequently produced in March, 2012 by the National Jewish Theater Foundation Off Broadway at the Roundabout Theater's Harold & Mimi Steinberg Center Black Box Theater. This production, directed by Arnold Mittelman, featured Greg Mullavey, Andi Potamkin, Donald Corren and Dee Pelletier. Reviews of this production were uniformly positive. The New York Times called the revised play \\"A revelation... frightening... thought-provoking... genuinely moving.\\" History News Network called it \\"An eye-opening history lesson... gut- wrenching... unforgettable.\\" The Philadelphia Jewish Voice said \\"Continues to haunt me... this is the theatre of witness at its best - provocative and morally ambiguous.\\" Perhaps most importantly, the play has been championed by Michael Berenbaum, one of the world's foremost Holocaust historians and co- Founder and Project Director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Mr. Berenbaum has written \\"As the scholar specifically named in Jeff Cohen's play \\"The Soap Myth,\\" I recognize in each of the characters people that I have encountered in my professional career from passionate survivors to stodgy Museum officials, from na√Øve and innocent reporters to pernicious Holocaust deniers. The play portrays them all powerfully.\\" Film A film, directed by Ron Kopp and Mr. Mittelman, was made of the National Jewish Theater production. That film will be broadcast nationally through American Public Television on PBS stations across the country. The sponsoring station, WPBT2 in Miami, broadcast the premiere on January 27, 2014. In addition, the film will be the first American offering on Britain's prestigious Digital Theatre website. Ron Kopp also directed \\"I Will Refuse to Bubble: History and Theater as Defiance,\\" a documentary about the making of \\"The Soap Myth\\" that examines the question of who has the right to write history, highlighting the importance of theater in understanding the world's most incomprehensible events. Featuring Holocaust survivor Irving Roth and scholars Michael Berenbaum, David Marwell and Bonnie Gurewitsch, it also is distributed online by Digital Theatre.

Life He was born at Bala, Merionethshire, in 1637, son of Edward Lloyd, a clerk there. After spending two years at Ruthin School, he was admitted, on 23 February 1655, sizar at St. John's College, Cambridge, graduated B.A. and M.A., and was in 1670 created D.D. by royal letters. For some time, shortly after taking his master's degree, he was chaplain to the English Merchants' Factory in Portugal, and vicar of Battersea, Surrey. He was Archdeacon of Merioneth from 1668 to 1672. He subsequently became chaplain to Thomas Clifford, 1st Baron Clifford of Chudleigh and was prebendary of Caddington Minor in St Paul's Cathedral from 4 May 1672 to March 1676. On 6 April 1675 he was elected bishop of Landaff, in succession to Francis Davies. He was transferred, 10 April 1679, to Peterborough, and on 11 June 1685 to Norwich. He wanted to sign the petition for which the Seven Bishops were tried in 1688, but his letter was delayed; he helped them in preparing their defence, which led to a threat that he should yet 'keep company with them'. At the Glorious Revolution Lloyd, although attending one meeting of the Convention parliament, did not come in to take the oaths by the date fixed. He subsequently absolutely declined to take them, but remained in the possession of his preferments until 1 August 1690, when he was suspended from the performance of his ecclesiastical functions until 1 February. 1691. He then was formally deprived. In 1692 William Sancroft, the deprived archbishop, formally delegated to Lloyd, as his proxy, the exercise of his archiepiscopal powers in spiritual matters. Lloyd signed two published letters, one A Vindication of the [nonjuring] Bishops, 1690, and another appealing to all Christian people for assistance to the suffering nonjuring clergy, July 1695. When a list of the nonjuring clergy was taken over to James II at the Ch√¢teau de Saint- Germain-en-Laye, the exiled king directed Sancroft and Lloyd each to nominate one of the suspended clergymen for the episcopate. Lloyd nominated Thomas Wagstaffe as suffragan bishop of Ipswich, and performed the consecration 24 February 1693 in a private house, assisted by the deprived bishops of Peterborough and Ely. Lloyd retired to Hammersmith, where he continued though with caution to exercise his episcopal functions. He died 1 January 1710, and was buried in the belfry of Hammersmith parish church, in accordance with his own wish. He had outlived all the deprived bishops except Thomas Ken. His death was followed by the return of Henry Dodwell, Robert Nelson, Brokesby and others to the national church, Ken having expressly declared his wish that the schism should be ended. Family He left a widow, Hannah, and a son John (B.A. 1694 and M.A. 1698, of St John's College, Cambridge), who died in 1706, a fortnight after he had married a daughter of Dr Humphrey Humphreys.

Seal of Saint Bernardino of Siena at the outer wall. The Eremo delle Carceri is a hermitage complex located above sea level in a steep forest gorge upon Monte Subasio, in Umbria, in central Italy, four kilometers above Assisi. The name Carceri derives from the Latin carceres, meaning \\"isolated places\\" or \\"prisons\\". The steps and bows of the gorge arch over a quatrefoil-shaped hole in the smooth pink stone, a natural grotto (the so- called \\"Hole of the Devil\\"). In the 13th century, Saint Francis of Assisi would often come to this place to pray and contemplate, as did other hermits before him. When he first came in 1205, the only building here was a tiny 12th-century oratory. Soon, other men followed him to the mountain, finding their own isolated caves nearby in which to pray. The oratory became known as Santa Maria delle Carceri after the small \\"prisons\\" occupied by friars in the area. The site and the oratory was probably given by the Benedictines to St. Francis in 1215, at the same time they gave him the Porziuncola in the valley below. Francis dedicated himself to a life of preaching and missions, but throughout his life he would frequently withdraw to the Carceri to pray. Around 1400, Saint Bernardino of Siena built a small friary, which includes a little choir and a simple refectory. The original wooden stalls of the choir and the tables of the refectory, which date from the 15th century, can still be seen on site. St. Bernardino also extended the earlier chapel by building a small church, which was also named Santa Maria delle Carceri. It contains a notable altarpiece fresco of the Virgin and Child. In the centuries that followed, various buildings were added around St. Francis' cave and the original oratory, forming the sizable complex that exists today. Today some Franciscan friars live there and visitors are welcome. Near the hermitage is a stone bridge and an ancient oak. According to legend, it was here that Saint Francis preached to the birds as they perched in the oak's branches. Buildings A variety of buildings were added around the cave and the original oratory, creating a large complex. * ‚Äò‚Äô‚ÄôEntrance‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äì From the gate and short tunnel leads into a courtyard and a well, said to have yielded water after a prayer of St. Francis.

The Sud Aviation Caravelle aircraft crashed that day at 21:09 GMT near a place called Douar Doum 8.4 km from the threshold of runway 04 and 1.4 km to the left of the extended centreline at a height of 87.5m above sea level, killing all 77 people on board, including 6 crew members. The weather was foggy and unfavourable for landing. Flight history The aircraft left Paris (ORY) at 18:26 GMT for the first leg to Rabat with passengers and load within limits and fuel for four hours. The flight was uneventful until approaching Rabat/Sal√® airport. At 21:09 GMT the aircraft hit the ground before reaching the runway and aside from the airport. It was completely destroyed. Investigation The investigation concluded that there was no evidence of technical failure, neither for physical failure of the personnel nor of air traffic control. Weather conditions were very unfavourable for landing at Rabat/Sal√© and fast changing and deteriorating shortly before the accident. The pilot took advice from the Air France operations agent in Casablanca and considered proceeding directly to Casablanca because of the weather. During the flight the crew reviewed the weather several times with the air traffic control and finally decided to land at Rabat, using the non-directional beacon (NDB). Air traffic control warned the pilot that the NDB was not aligned with the runway, but this message received no response. The investigation reported an \\"Error in instrument reading\\" as probable cause.

Description Performance scene from the 2009 documentary SING*ularity about OperaWorks, directed by Brad Mays, produced by Lorenda Starfeld OperaWorks is a training program for singers and instructors working in the field of classical music. Accepting a limited number of students selected each year from up to eight cities across the United States, the program operates from the beginning of June and runs through the end of July, annually. OperaWorks was founded in 1987 by classical pianist Ann Baltz as a response to what she saw as the myopic tendencies of conventional operatic training. Baltz envisioned a new approach to the training of vocalists, in which the \\"total instrument\\" would be addressed, not just the voice itself. Over the years, her program has expanded to include instruction in movement, Yoga, acting, visualization, conducting, improvisation and the Alexander technique, as well as career management. http://www.anderson.edu/academics/music/classical-improv/ Borrowing to some degree from teaching techniques long utilized in contemporary theatrical training, OperaWorks strives to free the individual vocal artist in such a manner that the physical conventions and artifice of opera performance can fall away, hopefully revealing something altogether truer to life itself. Recognizing the uniqueness of each individual artist, OperaWorks endeavors to develop singers from the inside out, thus enabling them to trust their own instincts ‚Äì musically, emotionally, dramatically. In 2006, Baltz invited independent filmmaker Brad Mays to spend an entire summer filming the various classes and events at OperaWorks.

Only one example was constructed (with registration SP-1220). Development The SZD-6x Nietoperz (Bat) was designed and built to research tail-less aircraft, and the control of them. Main designers were W≈Çadys≈Çaw Nowakowski and Justyn Sandauer. Built in a conventional fashion using wood throughout, fabric covering and steel for highly stressed parts and fittings the SZD-6x was a cantilever monoplane with the cranked wing attached to a short fuselage pod at the mid position. The inner portion of each wing was markedly swept forward out to approx. quarter-span, where the swept-back outer wing panels were attached. This is arrangement allowed for maximum distance between the centre of gravity and the vertical stabilizer, and placed the pilot at the centre of gravity, so that differing pilot weights had little impact on stability. The first 'hop' was made on 5 January 1951 at Bielsko to test control effectiveness and stability. For more comprehensive trials the glider was transported to Katowice airfield which suffered less turbulence from high ground. On 12 January 1951, the pilot Adam Zientek took an exploratory aero- tow behind a PWS-26 piloted by T. Hill, which nearly ended in disaster. The SZD-6x suffered PIOs (pilot induced oscillations) while still at low altitude over the airfield, hit the ground hard and was damaged. The first \\"real\\" flight took place on 2 February 1951, flown by A. Zientek. Later flights were completed successfully, but all the pilots agreed that the aircraft was not suitable for production due to inherent control problems. The control system of the SZD-6x was designed to allow the aircraft to be flown with several different control configurations. The trailing edges of the wings carried three surfaces each, all of which could be linked to form elevons or operated individually as ailerons, elevators or flaps. The metal-skinned split ailerons, (the outboard control surfaces), also formed the airbrakes, opening out to give increased drag. The ailerons/airbrakes could be connected to the rudder pedals to be used as drag rudders, similar to the drag rudders used on the Northrop flying wings. The inboard control surfaces on the swept ford section of trailing edge were typically used for trimming purposes deflecting 10¬∞ up or down. The controls were tested in three configurations: #With pitch control provided by all four elevons, roll by the split ailerons (operating together), speed / approach control by split ailerons / airbrakes and yaw controlled by the rudder. In this configuration the aircraft proved to be stable in pitch, being able to be flown hands-off during aero-tow, and pitch could be controlled simply by the pilot leaning forwards or backwards to adjust the centre of gravity. Lateral stability was noted to be poor to fair but acceptable and the aircraft was safe and capable of flying simple aerobatics. #As above for pitch and roll, but with the rudder locked and the pedals operating the ailerons / airbrakes differentially for yaw, lateral control prove barely adequate. #As in 2 but with the rudder removed. This configuration was inherently dangerous as any application of ailerons gave instant adverse yaw, and pitch and roll in the opposite direction to that intended. The prototype was used in the SZD for experimental purpose between 18 April 1952 and 26 February 1964, and it also took part in several air shows, even performing aerobatics.

This search mode is the default search system implemented in most operating systems, word processing systems, many online full-text search interfaces.  Incremental Search  The contrary of delimited search is incremental search in which a user gets instant feedback as he/she types a query based on what may exist in the content searched, thereby allowing him/her to adjust the query based on actual coverage of the target content instead of waiting for the system to compute results and possibly returning a \\"not found\\" error.  Critique  The renowned interface design guru, Jef Raskin, defined delimited search and compared it to his more favorite search interface (incremental search). Here are his own words in his famous work, \\"The Human Interface\\": > \\"With a delimited search, the computer waits for the user to type a pattern > and delimit it, after which it is the user who waits while the computer does > the search.

It provides intelligence support to Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC). Mission The 25 IS is a uniquely tasked unit, chartered to provide specialized intelligence across the spectrum of conflict. Squadron personnel are trained and qualified to operate as aircrew on board almost every combat aircraft within the AFSOC inventory. By integrating all-source intelligence and electronic combat capability for special operations forces (SOF), the 25 IS has made their unique intelligence resources integral to SOF mission planning, rehearsal, and execution. History=Origin= The 25 IS originated as the 6th Photo Laboratory Section on 28 January 1944 when it activated at Fort Campbell Army Airfield, Kentucky. The unit had two other designations: the 6th Photographic Technical Unit on 30 November 1944 and the 55th Reconnaissance Technical Squadron on 4 March 1949 through its inactivation on 16 June 1952. In that period, the unit also accomplished its specialized intelligence mission at DeRidder Army Air Base (AAB), Louisiana; Stuttgart AAB, Arkansas; Brooks Field, Texas; MacDill Field, Florida; Wright Field (now Wright-Patterson AFB), Ohio; Topeka AFB (later Forbes), Kansas; Ramey AFB, Puerto Rico; and finally Eglin AFB Auxiliary Field #9 (now Hurlburt), Florida. On 1 October 1993, the Air Force activated and redesignated the unit as the 25th Intelligence Squadron at Hurlburt. That renewed life can be traced to events that occurred during Operation Just Cause in Panama in 1989 and emerging AFSOC requirements after Operation Desert Storm in 1991. The manpower and resources that later formed the 25 IS came from an Air Force Intelligence Command (AFIC) Liaison Office (OL-MH) at AFSOC and from a 693rd Intelligence Wing detachment (Det 7) that provided the first airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) support to AFSOC operations. As a result of an Air Force reorganization, AFIC became the Air Intelligence Agency (AIA) on 1 October 1993. That reorganization included the activation of the 25 IS. Subsequently, the Air Force changed its name to the 25th Information Operations Squadron on 1 October 2000 and back to the 25 IS on 4 May 2008. =Operations today= The 25 IS trains and equips airborne ISR operators to fly on all AFSOC platforms to provide real-time threat warning, enhanced situational awareness, and advanced technical intelligence exploitation to AFSOC aircrews and joint special operations forces. Additionally, the 25 IS also employs a wide range of intelligence analysts, technical maintenance, and support personnel that are critical to global SOF missions.

It provides competency-based education in an open-entry, open-exit environment which prepares over 6,000 high school and adult students with career and technical skills. Generally, students may start or end at any time during the year and progress at a rate suited to individual learning style. Training is provided at the Kaysville, Utah campus, in local high schools, and at Davis Tech Freeport in Clearfield, Utah. The college is accredited by the Commission of the Council on Occupational Education. History DATC Campus LifeDavis Technical College had its genesis in the early 1970s. To meet the demands of training immigrants in English and vocational skills, Davis School District started the Davis Vocational Center. It was located in a former elementary school in Layton, Utah. The Davis Vocational Center began by offering classes in English as a Second Language (ESL), Basic English, Basic Math, and business classes. The classes were open to both adults and high school students. Agencies such as departments of rehabilitation and other division in the Department of Labor requested additional training. The Utah State Board of Education realized the need for a larger vocational training facility in the future and purchased east of Davis High School in Kaysville, Utah. On this site, two buildings were constructed to house expanding technical programs. ESL and business classes remained at the Layton site. In 1978, Davis School District officials were successful in their request to make the Center a state vocational school under the jurisdiction of the Utah State Board of Education. The Davis Area Vocational Center was established to serve Davis and Morgan counties. For the first five years, the Center operated out of the two original existing buildings and temporary classrooms as well as leased, rented and borrowed space. Beginning in 1983, the State constructed an additional . of space in three phases which were completed in 1987. In 1991, the Davis Area Vocational Center‚Äôs name changed to Davis Applied Technology Center. This change signaled the importance of technological applications in the workplace and technology training through applied principles. In 1998, the Center expanded its current facility by to accommodate new health programs and open additional space for existing programs. In June 2001, a special session of the Legislature passed House Bill 1003, creating the Utah College of Applied Technology (UCAT), the state's 10th newest institution of higher education. The new legislation changed the institution‚Äôs name from Davis Applied Technology Center to Davis Applied Technology College. With a $2.2 million gift from the Roy and Elizabeth Simmons Family Foundation and other donations, Davis Tech opened an entrepreneurship center on the school‚Äôs main campus in 2006. The . facility houses the Davis Business Alliance, a small business development office, the Davis Chamber of Commerce, Service Corp of Retired Executives (SCORE), Utah Bid Development Solutions (UBiDS), and Grow Utah Ventures. In 2009, Davis Tech added a . building to its campus. Named after the founder of technical education, the Haven J. and Bonnie Rae Barlow Technology Building houses the manufacturing, information technology, and transportation programs. Davis Tech Foundation Founded in 1993, the Davis Tech Foundation assists DTC financially by providing scholarships, equipment, and other support for technical education.

Early life and training She was born in York, Pennsylvania, as Lois Harriet Marcus. She began singing while in elementary school and began a professional career after working with opera coaches in Philadelphia. She had been singing professionally for three years when a Metropolitan Opera assistant manager who had seen her sing in a performance in Colorado of Ludwig van Beethoven's only opera, Fidelio, convinced her to head to New York City. There she earned a contract with the Met after her participation in the opera company's 1949 Auditions of the Air competition.Grimes, William. \\"Lois Hunt, Half of Popular Operatic Duo, Dies at 84\\", The New York Times, July 28, 2009.

Accessed July 28, 2009. She sang the role of Adele in a 1953 presentation of a 90-minute version of Die Fledermaus on television, the first created by the Met for the new medium. She appeared on Earl Wrightson At Home in the early 1950s, having been a listener of the host's radio show when she was a teenager. She became a frequent performer on the show and developed an intimate personal relationship with Earl Wrightson that lasted for decades. The two appeared on television in the mid-1950s on The Robert Q. Lewis Show, a variety program. They went on tour around the United States, performing musical numbers and operettas at nightclubs and concert venues. They recorded musical selections on several albums for Columbia Records, including numbers by Jerome Kern and Sigmund Romberg recorded with the Percy Faith orchestra. Their final performances together were in a 97-city tour over six months in 1979 and 1980 of The Sound of Music, in which Hunt proudly stated that they \\"were the only two members of the cast whose understudies never went on\\", reflecting their \\"great pride in our professionalism and integrity\\". While performing at the Shoreham Hotel in Washington, D.C. in the early 1960s, they received an invitation sent on behalf of Lady Bird Johnson to perform at her home for the wives of a group of Japanese government officials who would be attending meetings at the White House. While visiting the Johnsons' residence the evening before their performance, Hunt and Wrightson were invited upstairs to meet the vice president. Lyndon Johnson, suffering from a cold, greeted them \\"in his green silk pajamas with his initials, LBJ, embroidered from just below his shoulder to just above his ankle\\". She later joked about their having met the future president for the first time while he was in his pajamas.

This is an annual herb producing a slender, erect stem up to 80 centimeters in maximum height. It is woolly toward the ends of the stems, less so toward the base of the plant. The leaves are narrow and sometimes toothed, the lowest approaching 11 centimeters long and the uppermost reduced in size. The inflorescence is made up of a single flower head at the tip of the slender stem. The flower head is lined with tiny lance-shaped phyllaries with purplish pointed tips and sometimes a coat of woolly fibers. The head is discoid, lacking ray florets but bearing several funnel-shaped lavender disc florets with raylike lobes. The fruit is an achene with a very hairy hard body 2 or 3 millimeters long and a small, bristly pappus on top.

She seems to be exactly what Vianne herself used to be: a benevolent force and a free spirit, helping people wherever she goes. But Zozie is a thief of identities, maybe even a collector of souls. She has her eye on Vianne's life, and begins to insinuate herself into the family. She is soon working at the chocolaterie, helping and understanding everyone as Vianne used to do. She helps Anouk to deal with the bullies who torment her at school. The shop begins to prosper under her guidance, much to Thierry's displeasure. When Roux, ignorant that he is Rosette's father, arrives at their shop, Zozie helps Vianne to decide between a stable life with Thierry and a romance with the man she loves. But as Vianne's life begins to improve little by little under Zozie's influence, it becomes clear that all this must come at a terrible price. Finally, Vianne is forced to confront Zozie on her own ground, to reclaim her magic and her identity and to fight back - but is it too late? Characters * Vianne Rocher is a mother, a witch, a traveller and a chocolate-maker with a troubled soul. She has travelled all her life, and is impelled to move on \\"with the wind\\", being unable to settle down. She has great powers of empathy, and is able to help people in trouble. She lives for her daughters, but is secretly afraid of other relationships, preferring to flee rather than settle down and face the possibility of rejection. She has spent most of her life on the run from the various embodiments of her fears; \\"the Black Man\\", who represents the Church, and \\"The Kindly Ones\\", which symbolize her fear of losing her children. * Anouk is now 11 and entering adolescence. She is unhappy and confused, disliking the way her mother has changed. She is bullied at school and hates the fact that her mother is contemplating marriage. *Rosette is a child, age 4, with a mature sense of humour. She has never talked but she can sign and read, and she loves to draw. One doctor diagnosed her with cri-du-chat (a rare genetic disorder). She's very perceptive to magic. Zozie observes that she has no sense of danger, that's she's accident-prone, and she gets violent when she has a tantrum. She has an imaginary friend called \\"Bam\\", which Vianne can sometimes see. * Zozie de L'Alba is a shadowy figure. She has many personas, but the one she uses to seduce Vianne and Anouk is charming, bohemian and free-spirited. She loves shoes, which she uses to read character (just as Vianne uses chocolate). However, underneath the charm, her ruthlessness and greed emerge. She is unusual among Harris' characters in that her motives are never made entirely clear - she remains a mystery until the end. *Thierry le Tresset is described by Vianne as tall and heavy, with \\"an open face\\", \\"working hands\\", and \\"best suited to building walls\\". He is 51, divorced and rich. He has a very simple, enthusiastic personality - \\"cheery, determined and impervious to any argument\\", but he is also patronizing and slightly mysoginistc. He is very much in love with Yanne (Vianne), viewing her as a sort of Cinderella, but he knows nothing of her true identity. *Madame Poussard is a family friend of Thierry's, the former owner of the chocolate-shop. She died near Halloween of a stroke. *Jean-Loup Rimbault is a pupil at Anouk's school. Age 12, he's been held back a year because of a heart condition, which caused him to stay in the hospital for four months. His parents are divorced and he lives with his mother. He's an amateur photographer, his favourite word is 'lame' and his ambition is to see and photograph a ghost. Anouk got to know him when she tried the new attitude Zozie taught her, as a personal dare, and they became friends almost immediately. His favourite chocolate is bitter almond crisp, \\"Rather an adult taste\\", thinks Vianne. He's Anouk's first real friend at school. *Roux is a character who first appeared in Chocolat. A traveller, one of the \\"river-rats\\", he is still in contact with Vianne through letters, although they haven't seen each other for four years. He is Rosette's father, following a brief liaison with Vianne, but Vianne has never told him this. He's been in love with Vianne without her knowledge since they met, but she considers him too volatile and free-spirited to be husband or father material. He lives on a boat, takes occasional work to make a living, and trusts hardly anyone. He is stubborn, honest and direct, but living as he does on the fringes of society, Vianne thinks he can never settle down. *Laurent Pinson is the owner of a cafe in the same square as the chocolaterie. *Nico is one of the people Zozie helps; a very fat young man who has issues about his weight, women and his mother. He likes Alice. *Alice the florist's daughter. A borderline anorexic, she is very shy and childlike. With Zozie's help, she finds love with Nico. *Chantal one of Anouk's schoolmates. A snobby, gossiping rich girl who enjoys the advantages of having a powerful father. *Suzanne once a friend of Anouk, she abandoned her to be part of the popular crowd, and is now one of Anouk's principal tormentors. *Madame Luzeron is an old lady, the owner of a fluffy, peach-coloured dog. She buys chocolates regularly from Vianne, but only warms to her when Zozie finds out the secret of her prickly disposition. Magical motifs *Dia de los Muertos (Death 1, p. 16) is the Mexican festival of the ‚ÄúDay of the Dead‚Äù on November 1. *The Flayed One (Death 1, p. 16) is a reference to the Aztec god Xipe or Totec, who was in the habit of wearing the skin of a flayed man over his own. At his rather bloody festival, the Aztecs killed all the prisoners that they had taken in war, and these would also be subject to flaying. *Pan de muerto (Death 1, p. 17) is the ‚Äòbread of the dead‚Äô, bread that is formed into the shape of a skull or bones. *Mictecacihuatl (Death 1, p. 17) was the Queen of the Underworld, who is supposed to keep watch over the bones of the dead. She presides over the festivals of the dead (which have now become the modern Day of the Dead). She is also known as the Lady of the Dead, and it is reputed that she was born, and then sacrificed as an infant. *‚ÄúTezcatlipoca or The Smoking Mirror‚Äù (One Jaguar 5, p. 75) is another Aztec god, who had a nagual (i.e. familiar) that was a jaguar, which is probably why this part of the book is called ‚ÄúOne Jaguar‚Äù. *Odinists (One Jaguar 5, p. 75) are the members of a New Age movement who do not only worship Odin. According to the Odinist Fellowship, ‚ÄúOdinists value and esteem everything that sustains, promotes, enhances and enriches life‚Äù. They celebrate Nature, and feast rather than fast. *I Ching (One Jaguar 5, p. 76), the famous ‚ÄòBook of Changes‚Äô, is the oldest of Chinese classic texts. It is a symbol system that is designed to identify order in what seem like chance events. Western society has often regarded it as akin to divination, hence its mention here. *The Golden Dawn (One Jaguar 5, p. 76) was a magical order of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which formed a huge influence on twentieth-century western occultism. *Crowley (One Jaguar 5, p. 76) refers to Aleister Crowley, an influential member of the Golden Dawn. *Liber Null (One Jaguar 5, p. 76), a book on chaos magic by Peter J. Carroll. *Necronomicon (One Jaguar 5, p. 76) is a fictitious book that author H.P. Lovecraft referred to in his works. *Xochipilli (One Jaguar 8, p. 95) is the Aztec god of love, games, beauty, dance, flowers, maize, and song. His name contains the words xochitl (\\"flower\\") and pilli (\\"prince\\"), and so he is often called \\"flower prince\\". *Two Rabbit (p. 99) is a reference to Ometochtli, the Aztec god of drunkenness, and leader of the four hundred rabbit gods of drunkenness (which was the amusing Aztec way of referring to units of alcohol). *Theobroma cacao (Two Rabbit 3, p. 120) is the biological name for the chocolate plant and is derived from the Greek expression for ‚Äòfood of the gods‚Äô. *Hurakan (Two Rabbit 3, p. 121) is a Mayan god. *Scrying (Change 7, p. 178) i.e. divining the future using a crystal ball. *‚ÄòHubble bubble, toil and‚Ä¶‚Äô (Change 7, p. 179) ‚Äì the voice in Zozie‚Äôs head is referring to the three witches in William Shakespeare‚Äôs Macbeth. *Magi (Advent 5, p. 230), that is to say the ‚ÄòThree Wise Men‚Äô from the Bible are believed to have come from Persia (Iran). The word ‚Äòmagic‚Äô is derived from ‚Äòmagi‚Äô. The Magus is also a tarot card. *Seven Macaw (Advent 12, p. 264) or Vucub Caquix was a Mayan god who would often claim to be the sun or the moon to his worshippers. *Totem (The Kindly Ones 1, p. 273) ‚Äì referring to a spirit animal helper as a ‚Äòtotem‚Äô is a rather New Age term. *Saturnalia (The Kindly Ones 1, p. 278) is a Roman festival celebrating the dedication of the temple of Saturn in late December. *The Oak King and the Holly King (The Kindly Ones 1, p. 278), in Celtic mythology, battle each other at Yule and midsummer to see who will rule over the next half of the year. The Oak King wins at Yule, and the Holly King wins at midsummer. *Mischief Night (The Kindly Ones 2, p. 283) is observed on different dates throughout the UK just before Halloween, although it has merged into Halloween‚Äôs trick or treating. *The Tower (p. 343) is a Tarot card that also featured heavily in Joanne Harris‚Äôs Holy Fools. It is usually read as a blow that forces the subject to re-examine all the pretences that they have been living under, so is quite appropriate for Vianne. *Santa Muerte (The Tower 7, p. 383), literally the ‚ÄòSaint Death‚Äô of Mexican tradition, can be depicted as either male or female. *Eater of Hearts (The Tower 7, p. 383) is a reference to Ammit, a female figure from Egyptian mythology who was the personification of divine retribution for all the wrongs a person had done in his or her life. *Coatlicue (Yule 17, p. 447), the Aztec goddess who gave birth to the moon and stars, is the patron of women who die during childbirth. She is the Mother Earth that gives birth to and consumes everything. *Quetzalcoatl (Yule 17, p. 447) is the most famous Aztec god. Themes=Fear= A recurring theme is that of Vianne's fears. There are three; the Wind, the Black Man, and The Kindly Ones (A euphemism used for the Furies, the Greek personification of vengeance). The Kindly Ones are explicitly shown to be those who mean good but actually cause pain; to Vianne these are usually social workers, priests, and doctors. To Zozie, the Kindly Ones are the cost of the lives she leads; the authorities after her for fraud, theft and possibly murder. The Black Man are those who cannot live with the happiness of others, but this is never explained completely and The Black Man could be childish monsters. In this novel, Zozie is the Black Man. The Wind quite simply represents destiny, something which tells Vianne to leave a place even though she never wants to, and this is why she fears it. To Zozie, the wind is the force that drives her to travel, the wanderlust that moves her to travel. In Chocolat, Vianne confronts her fear of the Black Man, by opposing Reynaud. Here, in this novel, Vianne confronts the Wind - one way or another, by choosing to stay. =Magic= The magic in this book is a mix between the power of an open mind and a sort of strong intuition or powerful perception that nearly cross into the fantastic. The print of the Magical realism style is ever-present. =Free Will versus Fate= All the books reflect the combat against a predestined will. Vianne feels the force of the wind, and is driven by it, yet as she struggles to settle. =Chocolate= Just as in Chocolat, the power of chocolate, as a symbol for love and tolerance, is shown again in The Lollipop Shoes.

Zamorano used it to print books, letterheads and proclamations, but not a newspaper. When Commodore Robert F. Stockton arrived in Monterey with the American naval invasion in July 1846, he found the printing press stored in the Custom House and notified Colton.San Francisco chronology 1846-1849 from sfmuseum.org/hist/chron1.html accessed October 10, 2018.

The single- sheet publication was printed on a series of sheets, with English on one side and Spanish on the other. The biggest news item in the first edition was the United States declaring war on Mexico. On October 3, 1846, The Californian printed the first poem published in a California periodical, entitled \\"On Leaving the United States for California\\". The next issue carried the poetical rejoinder \\"On Leaving California for the United States\\". Both poems were unsigned, but were probably the same author.Historical Society of Southern California, Los Angeles County Pioneers of Southern California. Southern California Quarterly, Volume 5, p. 215. Historical Society of Southern California, 1901. The Californian moved to Yerba Buena, as San Francisco was then called, in mid-1847. The city was about to undergo rapid changes as the California gold rush got underway. The newspaper did not report about the discovery of gold because word spread so quickly from person to person. The Californian was forced to shut down May 29, 1848, because its entire staff had departed for the gold fields. Its rival newspaper, the California Star run by Mormon Samuel Brannan and Edward C. Kemble, suspended publication for the same reason on June 14. Both The Californian and the California Star were bought in 1848 and their printing equipment was combined into one publication, the Alta Californian. Finding that one printing press was sufficient, the older press from Monterey was moved by Kemble to Sacramento to print the Placer Times beginning in April 1849. Kemble wished to preserve the press in a museum, but sold it to an Englishman, H. H. Radcliffe, who used it in Stockton to print the Stockton Times and Tuolumne City Intelligencer from mid-1850 to April 1851. Radcliffe also used the old press to print the Sonora Herald for Dr. Gunn beginning in July 1850. Gunn eventually bought out Radcliffe. In October 1851, Gunn sold the press to George Washington Gore who brought the equipment to Columbia, California to print the Columbia Star. Gunn regained possession in November when Gore was unable to pay the balance of the purchase price. The old press was brought to Sonora, California to be displayed as a museum piece, and was soon lost there to one of the many fires that destroyed the town before 1858.

He was educated at Crewkerne School, and entered Wadham College, Oxford, where he was first fellow, and eventually became warden in 1719. He was successively rector of St. Ebbes, of Padworth, and of Blaydon, all in the diocese of Oxford.

It is unusual in its combination of an austere fortress with a comfortable residence. The original fortifications at Carrouges were besieged and destroyed by English forces during the Hundred Years War. After the war, the ch√¢teau was rebuilt by Jean Blosset, grand seneschal of Normandy, in the 15th century. In the 16th century, the family of Le Veneur de Tilli√®res came into possession of the ch√¢teau. It was extended several times until the 17th century, with notable additions including a gatehouse, the western bastion, and the grand apartments. The interior was remodelled in the 18th century, when the music room was built. The last Le Veneur sold the ch√¢teau to the French state, and from 1944 it was restored. It is now managed by the Centre des monuments nationaux and is open to the public. History Originally an oppidum, or defensive hill town, located at the southernmost border of the Norman duchy of William the Conqueror, Carrouges was vainly besieged by the Plantagenets in 1136. It was destroyed by the English in 1367, at the beginning of the Hundred Years War. Jean de Carrouges a vassal of Pierre II, Count of Alen√ßon, became famous as one of the combatants in the last judicial duel to be permitted in France, in 1386. Following his victory, he was appointed a knight of honor to Charles VI. The heiress of Jean de Carrouges married Guillaume Blosset, and their son Jean Blosset was appointed grand seneschal of Normandy. He made advantageous marriages with two wealthy heiresses from Brittany, first, Marguerite de Derval, and second, Francoise of Chastel, vicomtesse de Dinan et de La Belli√®re. These alliances gave Blosset the means of restoring and expanding the ch√¢teau, which had suffered great damage following its confiscation by Henry VI of England after the battle of Verneuil in 1424. Blosset built the north-eastern wing of the ch√¢teau, in which King Louis XI lodged on 11 August 1473. =Le Veneur de Tilli√®res = Blosset died without heir, and the ch√¢teau passed to his nephew Jean Le Veneur, Bishop of Lisieux, who became a Cardinal in 1533, and who constructed the Renaissance ch√¢telet, known as the pavillon du cardinal Jean Le Veneur. At the time of the French Wars of Religion (1562‚Äì98), the ch√¢teau was again strengthened, with the construction of the western bastion, but during the following century the sumptuous grand apartments were built. In the 17th century, Tanneguy II Le Veneur, comte de Tilli√®res (d.1652), was dispatched to England to negotiate the marriage of Henrietta Maria of France, sister of Louis XIII, to the future King Charles I. Tanneguy II lived on his estates at Tilli√®res and left Carrouges to his brother Jacques, abbot of Silly. In 1637, Jacques Le Veneur resigned his abbacy to devote himself entirely to Carrouges. He decorated the chateau and the park, starting from plans and drawings prepared by Maurice Gabriel, an architect from Argentan. At the end of the 18th century, Alexis Le Veneur, vicomte de Tilli√®res (1746‚Äì1833), a soldier and progressive, was one of the supporters of the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He was elected mayor of Carrouges and administrator of the Orne department, then first president of the Conseil g√©n√©ral de l'Orne, and finally represented Orne in the Corps l√©gislatif. He was made a Count of the Empire by Napoleon Bonaparte. In total, the ch√¢teau remained in the La Veneur family for five centuries, until 23 April 1936, on which date Marie Gaston Tanneguy IX, comte Le Veneur de Tilli√®res, sold the ch√¢teau into state ownership, for F200,000. It has been classed as a monument historique since 1927, Ch√¢teau de Carrouges and is now in the care of the Centre des monuments nationaux. Ch√¢teau de Carrouges Architecture The Ch√¢teau de Carrouges is rectangular in plan, surrounded by a moat. The central courtyard opens on to a terrace to the south-west. Although elements survive from the 15th and 16th centuries, the majority of the architecture is in the Henri IV and Louis XIII styles. The frontage is constructed of red brick and granite, the roofs are of blue slates. The ch√¢teau also has a keep of the 14th century, two storeys high and topped by machicolations. The 16th century ch√¢telet, or gatehouse, comprises four circular turrets, and was probably built by Jean Le Veneur. It is constructed of red and black bricks. =Interiors= The ground floor of the east wing contains the service areas, while the first floor contains the state apartments. The apartments are decorated in Renaissance and traditional styles. The \\"Louis XI room\\" contains a bed with fabric imitating Hungarian point stitch. The chimney breast in the antichambre d'honneur is decorated with a hunting scene. The dining room is furnished with a granite chimney piece, with Corinthian capitals. Furniture is of the Louis XIV and Restoration styles. The Salon des Portraits contains portraits of the lords and owners of Carrouges. The Grand Salon occupies one corner of the building, the straw- coloured woodwork dates from the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th century. The main staircase, with its pink brick vaults, rests on four piles laid out in a square. =Gardens = The current park and gardens extend to , and are currently undergoing restoration.

The islands are on eastern side of the Atlantic Ocean on the south-west approaches to the island of Great Britain and are renowned for the numerous shipwrecks in the area and the nearby Bishop Rock lighthouse. All the uninhabited islands are owned by the Duchy of Cornwall and are managed by the Isles of Scilly Wildlife Trust, which looks after the archaeological and historical remains on the islands, as well as the flora and fauna. Landing is not allowed on the island. Geography Rosevear is the largest of the Western Rocks and has a relatively flat top to . The island is situated within a group of rocks which stretches from the Round Rock of Crebawethan in the north to Pednathise Head in the south. History The island was used as a base camp, during 1709 and 1710, for the Herbert salvage expedition, which worked the wrecks of the Association and the other naval vessels in 1707. The ghost of opera singer and actress Ann Cargill, who died when the British East India Company packet ship Nancy sank near Rosevear on 24 February 1784, is said to haunt the island. Her body, still clutching her 18-month-old son, was originally buried on Rosevear, although she was later moved to Old Town Church on St Mary's, along with her child and Halden, the captain. In the 1840s and 1850s the island was again inhabited by workmen, this time building the Bishop Rock lighthouse. It was said that they heard mysterious music and were troubled by ghosts. Following a decision to build a lighthouse on the Bishop Rock in April 1847, Trinity House decided to make Rosevear the base because it was the nearest island (3.2 km) with a relatively flat area. The island was used as a base from 1847 to 1850, for the unsuccessful first attempt and for the successful construction from 1851 to 1858. Four main elements of the base remain. Two buildings, one a workers' lodge and mess and the other a workshop, are to the north-west of the complex, a slab-built platform by the east coast and a smiths hearth between the lodgings and workshop. Another building can be seen further south on the east coast. The surviving walls are from 0.4 m to 0.7 m high, with the best preserved are up to 3.0 m A ship's funnel lies amongst the rocks of Rosevear; this comes from the Cit√© de Verdun, which was wrecked on Rosevear in 1925.Glynis Cooper, Rosevear: A Desert Island Story, Historic Occasions, 2002. p4. . Natural history Landing on the uninhabited islands is both difficult and discouraged, and there are few published records of visits by naturalists. In 1971, the rocks and islands were designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest for their breeding sea birds. A visit by Geoffrey Grigson, in or around 1947, found a few Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica), scores of razorbill (Alca torda), European shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) and great black-backed gull (Larus marinus). A heavy fall of migrants was seen on a visit by Rosemary Parslow in October 1990 with dozens of European robin (Erithacus rubecula) and goldcrest (Regulus regulus), and several yellow‚Äìbrowed warbler (Phylloscopus inornatus); all feeding amongst the vegetation. The island has replaced Melledgan as the site of the third largest colony of European storm petrel (Hydrobates pelagicus) in England with fifty- seven occupied sites recorded during the Seabird 2000 survey, increasing to 129 occupied sites in the repeat survey in 2006. The colony of shag on Rosevear and the rest of the Western Rocks is of national importance. During storms the sea can wash over the island, and there is a shingle community of plants with tree mallow (Lavatera arborea), sea curled dock (Rumex crispus littoreus) and Atriplex sp. The only other species recorded are sea beet (Beta vulgaris subsp. maritima), common scurvygrass (Cochlearia officinalis), orache sp, and rock sea-spurry (Spergularia rupicola).

He was also awarded the Gouden Ganzenveer, given to people who have significantly contributed to Dutch literary culture, in 2002. Zeeman died in July 2009 at the age of 50, of a brain tumor. Biography Zeeman was born in Marken, a small, mainly Protestant town north of Amsterdam, in a pastor's family. His father wanted him to study theology, but Zeeman left faith and family behind to study philosophy in Utrecht and Groningen, though he never got his degree. He worked in a bookstore in Leeuwarden and began reviewing literature. Literary career and criticism From 1991, Zeeman wrote columns and essays for the Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant, on poetry, prose fiction and non-fiction, music, theater, and visual arts. He also published a number of poetry and short story collections. For two years he was the editor of the arts section of de Volkskrant, but lost that position because he was notoriously difficult to work with; afterward, he worked freelance, and for a while was the paper's cultural correspondent in Rome. His knowledge of literature was immense and his work as a critic influential. He has been compared to Kees Fens, the most widely recognized Dutch critic). Especially notable was his feud with Joost Zwagerman, one of the most prominent Dutch writers from the late 1980s onwards, whose novel was \\"publicly executed\\" in Zeeman's television program. Television career Starting in the mid-1990s, Zeeman presented two literary programs for VPRO television which gained national recognition, Kamer met Uitzicht and Zeeman met Boeken (1995‚Äì2002), for which he interviewed writers such as Jeanette Winterson, Edward Said, and Philip Roth.

His recordings of Navajo and Comanche music led to the establishment of the World Music Archives at the University. Biography He was born on 6 August 1916 in Everett, Massachusetts. He graduated from Harvard College in 1938 and entered the Juilliard School. However, he was doing anthropological field work during the summers at the same time and in 1940 decided not to pursue a career in music, instead enrolling in a Ph.D. program in anthropology at Columbia University. While in Manhattan, New York City, he joined the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), and remained a member for his entire life. In the Second World War, as a conscientious objector, he applied for and received exemption from military draft, and worked with the Civilian Public Service. After the war, he returned to Columbia. He accepted a teaching position at Wesleyan University in Connecticut in 1947, while still working on his degree. He was awarded the Ph.D. in 1950. Along with Alan Merriam, Willard Rhodes, and Charles Seeger, he founded the Society for Ethnomusicology in 1955.

The explored part of this karst cave is almost , making it one of the longest caves in Sweden. It is created by the drainage water from the Martebo mire. The water forms a stream with its outlet in the Baltic Sea. In the 15th to 19th centuries, mills and an ironwork were set up by the stream. Although the entrance of the cave has been known for centuries, the main part of it was discovered by three teenage boys during the 1940s‚Äì50s. It is visited by around 100,000 people every year and is one of the major tourist attractions on Gotland.  History  The cave was most likely formed before the last ice age. The water that creates it is drainage from the Martebo mire which is approximately east of Lummelunda. Most of the water runs as a stream, the Lummelunds√•n, through the north part of the cave system, exiting the limestone cliffs (known as the Klint) a few hundred meters from the coastline. The stream was much larger and more forceful before the mire, once the largest on Gotland, was drained at the end of the 19th century. The remaining drainage is led through an underground canal, dropping from Martebo mire to Lummelunda, at 400 liters/second. The stream has been used for industry since the Middle Ages. According to an undocumented litigation in 1778, a mill was built at Lummelunda in 1418. The oldest reliable record is from 1594, where three mills are listed at the stream. In the 1620s, six mills were in use at the Lummelunds√•n. The cave itself has been known as long as the stream has been used. Carl Linnaeus wrote about the cave during his journey to Gotland in the summer of 1741. The part of the cave where the stream has its outlet, the Linn√©'s Cave, is named after him. The Linn√©'s Cave is wide, high and about long. The bottom of it is filled with water. The Lummelunda Cave is mentioned in the 1917 cave investigation made by geologist and Gotlander Henrik Munthe, where it is called Kytt-Janns k√§llare (\\"Kytt-Jann's cellar\\"). The first documented attempt to explore the cave was made in 1924 by zoologist Torsten Gisl√©n, but he never got further than into the cave despite several later attempts. = The Three Boys = The breakthrough in finding the cave system happened in 1948, when three teenage boys, Lars Olsson, √ñrjan H√•kansson and Percy Nilsson, known as \\"The Three Boys\\" (De tre pojkarna), found an entrance to the rest of the cave. For seven years they explored the cave on Sundays using matches, candles, planks and a small boat to get deeper into the system. After having explored the first hall of the cave for two years, a large block of stone fell from one of the walls, widening a small opening in the cliff. This led to a long passage (later called \\"The Boys' Passage\\", Pojkarnas g√•ng) into the first large cave hall, \\"The Mountain King's Hall\\" (Bergakungens sal). From 1959 onwards, this hall became the location for the start of the guided tours. A bit further in is \\"The Chapel\\" (Kapellet), named thus by the boys who thought it looked like a church, where their exploration was hindered by a lake. It was not until 1955, that they managed to get another further in, using an inflatable boat. On 21January 2011, \\"The Three Boys\\" were honored in a ceremony at the Campus Gotland. Lars Olsson died on 19 October 2011, and Percy Nilsson died in December 2013. All three were made honorary members of the Swedish Speleology Society (Sveriges Speleologf√∂rbund, SSF). = Further explorations = In 1959, a long tunnel was made from the surface to \\"The Mountain King's Hall\\" to make the cave more accessible to visitors. Another of tunnels and the largest hall so far, was discovered by cave divers in September 1985, after they had passed four underwater passages (or \\"traps\\").  Geology and geography  The Lummelunda Cave is situated in Lummelunda, about north of Visby. Its opening is behind the Lummelunda Manor at the old mill √ñverstekvarn (\\"The Topmost Mill). The cave is a karst cave, formed by surface water trickling down through cracks in the limestone. When the surface water meets the groundwater, it starts to dissolve the limestone and widen the cracks into passages and halls. It is one of the longest caves in Sweden; the explored part of it is almost long. 33 sinkholes have been found in the main canal leading the water from Martebo mire to the cave. In the area west of the cliff there are five springs. After the draining of the mire the flow of water in the canal have decreased significantly, from in 1948, to in 1977. This has caused some of the sinkholes to disappear. During dry summers there is an impending danger that the cave is completely drained. The cave is roughly divided into two parts: one dry, also called the fossil system, and a wet, active part. A large number of fossils and stalactite formations can be found in the dry part. The cave has a relatively stable climate with a humidity of 95‚Äì100%. According to a source from 1989, the temperature is on average and points out that fluctuations in temperature have been noticed as a result of the many visitors. A source from 2011, states that the temperature is . = Nature reserve = A nature reserve to protect the Lummelunda Cave, was established on 20March 1989. The reserve is ; it includes the cave and the corresponding area above the ground and is called the Lummelunda Cave Nature Reserve (Naturreservatet Lummelundagrottan).  Biology  At least 83 different species of animals including worms, spiders, centipedes, crayfish, beetles, butterflies, fish, mice and bats, have been found in the cave. Plants grow near the artificial lights in the outer parts of the cave. Since the plants are not a natural part of it, they are removed to keep the environment as original as possible. The many visitors also have a negative effect on the biology of the cave. The landscape above the cave, which is also part of the nature reserve, is characterized by the karstification of the area. It is bisected by a steep cliff running in a north‚Äìsouth direction through the reserve. The eastern part on top of the cliff, is covered in pine forest, and the western part between the cliff and the shore is grassland with deciduous trees.  Tourism and tours  The Lummelunda Cave has been open to the public since 1959. It is visited by about 100,000 people each year, making it the most visited cave in Sweden, and one of the major tourist attractions on Gotland. \\"The Mountain King's Hall\\" and \\"The Chapel\\" (these combined are called the Visitors' Cave) are included in the regular tours. It is also possible to go another into the cave system with the special tours. These tours require a trained guide and visitors have to wear special gear and use small boats.

Township of Wayne is a ruling of the Illinois Supreme court made in 1998, where it was held that municipalities are not liable for the damage cyclists suffer on the poorly maintained roads. The cyclists were ruled \\"permitted, but not intended, users of the roads\\" in the state of Illinois. Under the state law, municipalities have a duty to maintain local roads in a safe condition. However they are liable for damages only if the use of a road was both permitted and intended. The justices were sharply divided on the issue‚Äîfour of them voted for the decision and three against. The dissenters called the decision \\"absurd and dangerous\\". The case originated from an incident on September 8, 1992 in which the cyclist Jon Boub was riding over a bridge in Township of Wayne. The bridge was being renovated at the time, and the asphalt had been partially removed from the road bed, revealing gaps between the wooden planks. When the front wheel of the Boub's bike \\"became stuck between two of the planks\\", he was thrown off the bike, hit the steel railing of the bridge, and received severe injuries. Boub sued the Township of Wayne on September 23, 1993 claiming negligence on the part of the municipality. The lawsuit was dismissed by the lower courts and subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court of Illinois. Effect The decision created a disincentive for Illinois municipalities to declare roads safe for cyclists. Over a seven-year period, the Illinois General Assembly tried several times to change the law, without success.

He served as Bishop of Burlington from 1899 until his death in 1908. Biography Michaud was born in Burlington, Vermont, to Stephen and Catherine (n√©e Rogan) Michaud. He attended the school run by Rev. Jeremiah O'Callaghan, the first resident priest of Vermont, and served as an altar boy to the new bishop, Louis De Goesbriand. Following his father's death in 1847, he worked in various Burlington lumber industries and later graduated from Bryant and Stratton Commercial College. In September 1865 he entered the Sulpician-run Montreal College in Quebec, Canada, followed by studies at Holy Cross College in Worcester, Massachusetts (earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1870) and at St. Joseph's Seminary in Troy, New York. Michaud was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Edgar Wadhams on June 7, 1873. He then served in Newport, Albany, Barton and Lowell, where he established the first Catholic churches, including st. Mary Star of the Sea in Newport. After being briefly felled by smallpox and given further pastoral responsibilities, Michaud was recalled to Burlington in 1879 to handle the construction of St. Joseph's Orphanage, completed in 1883. He concurrently did pastoral work in Bennington, North Bennington, Fairfield, Underhill and Charlotte. He was later named pastor of St. Stephen's ChurchSt. Stephen's Church in Winooski and, after a period of rest spent in Europe, of St. Frances de Sales ChurchSt. Frances de Sales Church in Bennington (October 1885). On May 4, 1892, Michaud was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Burlington and Titular Bishop of Modra by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following June 29 from Archbishop John Joseph Williams, with Bishops Denis Mary Bradley and Henry Gabriels serving as co-consecrators. He succeeded the late Bishop De Goesbriand as the second Bishop of Burlington upon the latter's death on November 3, 1899. During his tenure, Michaud completed the Cathedral Church, built the Fanny Allen Hospital and staffed it with the Religious Hospitalers of St. Joseph. The Sisters of Charity of Providence operated another new hospital in St. Johnsbury; the Loretto Home for the Aged in Rutland was served by the Sisters of St. Joseph. In 1904, the Bishop invited the dedicated Society of Saint Edmund to establish St. Michael's College at Winooski Park. In 1905, the Daughters of Charity of the Sacred Heart of Jesus came to Newport where they opened a mission to serve as teachers, nurses and catechists for the Northeast Kingdom. During his tenure, Michaud expanded the number of churches in Vermont from 72 to 94. There were 75,000 Catholics, 102 priests, 286 religious sisters, and 20 parochial schools serving some 7000 students. Michaud later died in New York, aged 63. He is buried at Resurrection Park in South Burlington.

Along with his accomplice, Michael Corbett, Glenn was found guilty of murdering three people in 1975. Glenn and Corbett were responsible for a total of five deaths in and around Colorado Springs, Colorado. One of Glenn's most famous victim was Karen Grammer, the younger sister of actor Kelsey Grammer.  Murders  The killings began on June 19, 1975, when Glenn, a civilian employee at Fort Carson, Corbett, a soldier, and another soldier kidnapped Daniel Van Lone, a 29-year-old cook just getting off work from the Four Seasons hotel, to rob him. They later drove Van Lone to a remote area, made him lie on the ground, and shot him in the head. They got 50 cents from him. Eight days later, the pair met Winfred Proffitt, 19, another Fort Carson soldier, at Prospect Lake, ostensibly to sell him some marijuana. Training with bayonets, Corbett stabbed Proffitt with one to see what it was like. The murdering duo committed their final and most publicized killing on July 1, 1975. Glenn, Corbett, and two other men decided to rob the Red Lobster restaurant on South Academy Boulevard. They left without any money, but on their way out they grabbed Karen Grammer, an 18-year-old who worked there and was waiting for her boyfriend to get off work, because they feared she could identify them. After robbing a convenience store, the men took her to the apartment they shared, where they raped her repeatedly. They promised to take Karen home, then sat her in the car, put a cloth over her head and let her out in a mobile home park on South Wahsatch Avenue. Then Glenn, who, according to court testimony, had taken LSD, stabbed her in the throat, back and hand, and left her to die. In a desperate attempt to save herself, she ran toward the back porch of a nearby home where there was a light, but the homeowners were out. She died there, leaving bloody hand prints and fingerprints where she tried to reach the doorbell for help. Police photographs show a bloody hand print on the wall, inches from the doorbell. Police did not know her name for a week, until her brother, Kelsey, arrived to identify the body.  Trial and conviction  Glenn was convicted in 1976 for the murders of Van Lone, Profitt, and Karen Grammer. Judge Hunter Hardeman, noting \\"there was no rhyme or reason for what happened,\\" sentenced Glenn to the gas chamber for Grammer's murder. Two years later, the Colorado Supreme Court overturned the state's death penalty. When Glenn was sentenced, the law allowed parole after a convict served 10 years, so he became eligible. Because two of his sentences were to be served consecutively, Corbett became eligible in 1996.  Parole denial  In 2006, as recommended by his case manager, Matt Sylvia, Glenn waived his first parole hearing so he could enroll in several programs at the prison that would help his chances. In 2009, Glenn was denied parole after the Colorado Parole Board received a letter from actor Kelsey Grammer, who described him as a \\"butcher\\" and a \\"monster\\". The board also heard from other relatives of the victims and from detectives before deciding not to release Glenn. Grammer himself had originally planned to attend the hearing at the state's Limon Correctional Facility, but a rain delay at New York City's JFK International Airport caused him to miss a connecting flight to Denver. Instead, Grammer decided to send a letter to Robert Russel, the retired El Paso County, Colorado District Attorney who successfully prosecuted Glenn. During the hearing, Glenn told the board: \\"I apologize for my participation in something so terrible. I am sincerely and truly remorseful,\\" According to his letter to Russel, Grammer has said that his sister had graduated from high school and later decided to take a year off after attending a semester of college. Grammer also said his sister may have moved to Colorado Springs because of a boy that she liked. \\"She was so smart and good and decent. She wrote poetry... We could laugh for hours together\\", Grammer wrote; \\"I was supposed to protect her -- I could not. I have never gotten over it. I was supposed to save her. I could not. It very nearly destroyed me... When we heard this man might be paroled, the suffering began anew\\".Findagrave.com (2009-07-27) Kelsey Grammer's Letter to the Colorado Parole Board to Keep Sister's Killer Behind Bars Glenn was eligible for parole in 2014, but was denied twice with his request deferred for three more years. In his emotional testimony given via video conference at the parole board hearing, Kelsey Grammer offered forgiveness after being convinced that Glenn was remorseful for killing his sister. However, Grammer said that Glenn should stay behind bars for the remainder of his life sentence.Nicholson, Kieran (2014-07-30). \\"Parole denied to convict who killed actor Kelsey Grammer's sister\\".

Before 2009 election protests Authorities first made plans for the Kahrizak detention center in 2001. The center's cells, located underground, were apparently built without free access to fresh air and toilet facilities. With the appointment of Ahmad-Reza Radan to the post of Tehran police chief, the center became a key site for carrying out the \\"Public Security Plan\\" targeting drug addicts and so-called \\"thugs and louts\\" endangering public morality. Reports of inhumane treatment of the prisoners at Kahrizak were released, with some comparing the conditions there unfavorably to even the notorious political ward 209 of Evin prison. Opposition groups have published unverified reports of human rights abuses and as many as 6,000 deaths inside the prison during the years 2007 and 2008. 2009 election protests Several thousand civilians and activists were arrested after the disputed presidential election in 2009. The head of the national security forces, Esmail Ahmadi- Moghaddam, stated in an interview with state television on August 5, 2009 that only the most dangerous offenders involved in the election protests were to be delivered to the Kahrizak center, which has a 50 prisoner capacity. The rest were to be taken to Evin prison. Tehran riot police and Basij members used other official and unofficial sites to detain suspects charged with endangering national security and public safety during the protests, including the Level -4 detention center in the Interior Ministry building. Ahmadi- Moghaddam further admitted in his television interview that many of the 140 prisoners he claimed to be housed at Kahrizak were low priority suspects. Mohsen Ruholamini, the son of a conservative politician who had supported pragmatic presidential candidate Mohsen Rezaei, was among the Kahrizak prisoners. On August 9, 2009, in a letter to the Chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council of Iran, Mehdi Karroubi demanded investigation of Iranian prisons for possible tortures and in particular sexual harassment of men and women. On August 19, he wrote to parliament speaker Ali Larijani, asking to meet with him, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, judiciary chief Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani, former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and the state prosecutor to \\"personally present my documents and evidence over the cases of sexual abuse in some prisons specially Kahrizak.\\" Ali Larijani and Sadeq Larijani (Judiciary committee) both officially rejected his claims and Ali Khamenei's representatives, and Vice Chairman of National Security Commission of the parliament demanded Karroubi's arrest.dead link Detainee abuse The release of some prisoners from Kahrizak on July 28, 2009 was followed by a number of testimonials in the foreign and opposition press on conditions inside the prison. Various news articles have reported on cramped and squalid cells where prisoners were routinely verbally abused and beaten by guards, some to death. Ahmad-Reza Radan, according to one account, daily took part in these beatings. Ahmadi-Moghaddam has since denied these reports about Radan as unfounded rumors. Mohsen Ruholamini and Amir Javadifar were two of the prisoners reported to have died from torture at Kahrizak. The medical report on Ruholamini's death originally stated that Ruholomini died of \\"physical stress, the effects of being held in bad conditions, multiple blows and severe injuries to the body.\\" The physician who wrote this report, Ramin Pourandarjani, subsequently died in mysterious circumstances in police headquarters. The autopsy report for Javadifar stated that his death was caused by blunt trauma injury from severe beating. National reactions Following massive arrests of civilians and reformist activists by Iranian police, a number of Iranian intellectuals and reformist activists condemned the detentions, and called for the release of the imprisoned protesters. In an exceptionally strong and critical speech, the Iranian opposition leader, Mir- Hossein Mousavi spoke out on July 17, 2009 against the arrests and killings of protesters. Erstwhile prime minister Moussavi said, \\"How can it be that the leaders of our country do not cry out and shed tears about these tragedies? ... Can they not see it, feel it? These things are blackening our country, blackening all our hearts. If we remain silent, it will destroy us all and take us to hell.\\" Grand Ayatollah Hosein-Ali Montazeri on 29 July demanded prosecution of anybody responsible for abuses. \\"Can the government deceive people by closing a detention center and blaming all the faults on a building?\\" he said. \\"What benefit does the government gain from the crisis, except angering the majority of the people and weakening the Islamic republic?\\" He added \\"Was the regime of the Shah able to resist the wave of dissatisfaction by using terror, oppression, censorship, torture, forced confessions and lying propaganda?\\" Grand Ayatollah Asadollah Bayat-Zanjani said: \\"We are witnessing sorrowful acts committed in the name of the regime and under the banner of God that bring pain to the heart of all supporters of the Islamic republic.\\" Closure and investigations Despite numerous reports of death and torture of arrested protesters in Iranian prisons, neither Iranian leader nor the Head of Judicial System took any measure to stop the crimes. The crimes were so grave that even several well known conservative politicians like Ali Motahhari expressed concerns about them. It was only after the death of the son of one of the conservative politicians, that the Iranian leader Ali Khamenei and head of Judicial System, Hashemi Shahroudi stepped in and ordered the closure of Kahrizak detention center. An official announcement was made on August 5, 2009 that three prison wardens were arrested in connection with the torture of detainees at Kahrizak. On December 19, 2009, Iranian authorities acknowledged that at least three protesters had been beaten to death in the Kahrizak jail. Twelve prison officials were charged with crimes, including murder. The Iranian parliament assigned a committee to investigate the incidents. The committee released a report in January 2010 that implicated former Tehran prosecutor-general Saeed Mortazavi as being behind the abuses. Days before the report was issued, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad appointed Mortazavi as his special advisor on smuggling, which in effect was an attempt to shield Mortazavi from prosecution. On August 19, 2015, Mortazavi was acquitted on charges connected to the torture and deaths of three young men at Kahrizak in 2009, but the court's decision was appealed. On September 2016, Mortazavi issued a public apology for the prisoner killings. Re-opening of Kahrizak detention center Ahmadi-Moghaddam on August 5, 2009 stated that the security forces were re- building the Kahrizak facility to meet national prison standards and would re- open its doors in one month.

He is infamously known for causing divisiveness within the revolutionary movement, and for insulting and maligning Andres Bonifacio for not being a lawyer and being the Director of Interior in the Convention of Tejeros. . Biography=Early life= Tirona was born in the town of Cavite el Viejo (modern Kawit) in Cavite province. He had an elder brother, Candido Tria Tirona. He was married four times, widowed thrice and had three children. He worked as a schoolteacher. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Colegio de San Juan de Letran and studied law in the University of Santo Tomas. =Katipunan= He and his elder brother Candido were members of the Katipunan, a secret society founded in 1892 by Andr√©s Bonifacio and others. The Katipunan sought independence from Spain through armed revolt. The Tironas were leading members of the Magdalo, one of two chapters of the Katipunan in Cavite, the other being the Magdiwang. They were close associates of Emilio Aguinaldo, mayor of Cavite el Viejo and the most prominent Magdalo leader. =Military career= After the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution in the last days of August 1896, Tirona ceased his law studies. With several provinces in open revolt, the rebels of Cavite enjoyed the most success. and they controlled virtually the entire province by September‚ÄìOctober 1896.. After the Spanish forces retook Imus, Cavite on March 25, Governor-General Camilo de Polavieja offered amnesty to surrendering rebels.. Tirona took advantage of the amnesty offer.. However, Tirona returned to Aguinaldo sometime later. Aguinaldo had been exiled to Hong Kong in December 1897 in accordance with the Pact of Biak-na-Bato which officially ended the revolution. In May 1898, the Philippines was embroiled in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Aguinaldo returned to the Philippines and officially resumed the revolution as an unofficial ally to the United States. Tirona was a witness and signatory of the Philippine Declaration of Independence on June 12. Commissioned as a colonel, Tirona headed a military expedition sent by Aguinaldo to Cagayan in August. He was subsequently appointed military governor of Cagayan and Isabela and held the rank of brigadier-general. Tirona represented the province of Batanes in the Malolos Congress in 1898-1899. =Humiliating Surrender= The Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War broke out in February 1899 and Tirona and his troops were in Cagayan. > \\"Having the best and well equipped troops among Aguinaldo's forces, he > surrendered in January 1900 without firing a single shot.\\" It was reported to Aguinaldo that Tirona became the servant of the American officer to whom he had surrendered for a time, cleaning his shoes and serving his meals. =Later life= Tirona supported the American colonial government after Aguinaldo's capture in March 1901. He was one of the representatives of Cavite el Viejo that met with the Taft Commission during their visit to Cavite on June 6.Report of the United States Philippine Commission to the Secretary of War for the period from December 1, 1900, to October 15, 1901 (1901). In the same year he held the position of provincial secretary of Cavite. He afterward served as provincial assessor and treasurer of Tarlac. Tirona lived to see the establishment of the Commonwealth of the Philippines in 1935. He died in 1939 just after the start of World War II. Controversy As the revolution progressed, the Magdalo and Magdiwang clashed over authority and jurisdiction and did not help each other in the face of Spanish counterattacks. Bonifacio was called to Cavite as the Supremo (supreme leader) or Presidente Supremo (Supreme President) of the Katipunan to mediate between the factions and unify their efforts. Meanwhile, Tirona's brother Candido was killed in battle on November 10 and he succeeded him as Magdalo secretary of war four days later. When Bonifacio arrived in Cavite in late November, Tirona was part of the welcoming party. Within Cavite, friction grew between Bonifacio and the Magdalo leaders. Earlier in October, Aguinaldo had issued a manifesto in the name of the Magdalo ruling council which proclaimed an insurgent government. This was done despite the existence of the Katipunan, which Bonifacio had already converted into an insurgent government with him as president just before the outbreak of hostilities... Once Bonifacio was in Cavite the Magdalo leaders made overtures about replacing the Katipunan with an insurgent government of their design. Bonifacio and the Magdiwang maintained they already had a government in the Katipunan.. After Bonifacio was acclaimed as the \\"ruler of the Philippines\\" by townsfolk, unflattering rumors about him began to spread. It was rumored that Bonifacio had stolen Katipunan funds, his sister was the mistress of a priest, and he was an agent provocateur paid by Spanish friars to foment unrest. Also circulated were anonymous letters which told the people of Cavite not to idolize Bonifacio because he was (allegedly) a Freemason, a mere warehouseman, an atheist, and uneducated. These letters also said Bonifacio did not deserve the title of Supremo since only God was supreme. Tirona was widely suspected to be responsible for the rumor-mongering. When confronted by Bonifacio, Tirona dismissed his accusations in such a manner that provoked him to anger. He drew a gun and would have shot Tirona if others had not intervened.. Tirona was present at the Tejeros Convention on March 22, 1897, wherein Bonifacio and leaders of the Magdalo and Magdiwang met to settle the issue of leadership of the revolution. Bonifacio presided over the elections that followed, despite his misgivings over the lack of representation by other provinces. Tirona helped distribute the ballots. Emilio Aguinaldo was elected President in absentia while Bonifacio was elected Director of the Interior.. Tirona loudly protested Bonifacio's election to Director of the Interior because he lacked a lawyer's diploma (the implicit message being that he lacked the education for the position). Tirona repeatedly suggested a prominent Cavite lawyer, Jos√© del Rosario, for the position. Since it had been agreed beforehand to respect the election results, Bonifacio demanded an apology. Instead, Tirona made to leave the assembly room. Angered, Bonifacio again drew his gun and was again restrained from shooting Tirona. Bonifacio invoked his position as chairman of the convention and leader of the Katipunan to declare the proceedings null and void. In the following days, Bonifacio refused to recognize Aguinaldo's government and alleged the elections were fraudulent. This allegation is supported by the revolutionaries Santiago √Ålvarez, Gregoria de Jes√∫s and Guillermo Masangkay... Bonifacio was eventually arrested, tried and executed for treason by Aguinaldo's government...

The first version was completed around 1767 and is today owned by the Barber Institute of Fine Arts, in Birmingham, England. The second version was painted around 1784 and is now part of the collection of the Art Gallery of Ontario. The Toronto version is the better known of the two. It was donated to the AGO by Frank P Wood in 1941,AGO: The Harvest Waggon and is one of the most prominent pieces in the gallery‚Äôs collection.John Bentley Mays. \\"Back to the land with Turner and Gainsborough.\\" The Globe and Mail. Toronto, Ont.: Jul 29, 1995. pg. C.16 Description Both paintings depict a group of peasants riding inside a simple wagon through a rural landscape with a collection of nearby animals. A young boy leads the wagon, while a man helps lift a young woman aboard. The painting is set in the area around Gainsborough's adopted city of Bath, where he lived for 14 years of his life. In 1995 the two museums collaborated on a joint show that displayed the two versions side by side, first on display in England and then in Canada. The two paintings of a similar subject done some seventeen years apart show the evolution of Gainsborough as an artist. The later painting is more sedate, the figures more composed and less excited. The Gainsborough scholar Hugh Besley sees landscape, people, and animals as more unified in the later work. He also sees more influence of Rubens on Gainsborough's style and technique, particularly of Rubens's The Descent from the Cross. The woman ascending to the wagon shows a motion opposite to Christ's. Christina Payne has commented on some of the symbolism in the 1784 work, noting that the broken pitcher placed in front of the pregnant passenger may be a symbol of virginity.Hugh Besley. \\"Gainsborough's Harvest Wagons: Toronto and Birmingham.\\" The Burlington Magazine Vol. 137, No. 1109 (Aug., 1995), pp. 574-575. The earlier painting is also far more intimate to the artist as the women in the wagon are portraits of Gainsborough's own daughters, Mary and Margaret.Meryle Secrest. Duveen: A Life in Art. University of Chicago Press, 2004 pg. 297 Provenance The first work could not find a buyer, perhaps being too ribald for the art market of the time.Brian Short The English Rural Community: Image and Analysis. CUP Archive, 1992 It was given to Gainsborough's friend Wiltshire, a mover who transported Gainsborough's paintings from Bath to exhibitions in London. Wiltshire's horses had also served as the model of the animals in the picture. The painting remained in Wiltshire's family until his grandson sold it in 1867. The second painting, done at the height of Gainsborough's fame, was sold to the Prince of Wales, later to become King George IV. It later became part of the collection of American steel magnate Elbert Henry Gary. Upon Gary's death in 1927 his collection was auctioned off, and The Harvest Wagon was one of the most sought-after works.\\"Art: Gary's Gainsborough\\" Time Apr. 30, 1928 After a competitive auction it was purchased by art dealer Joseph Duveen for $360,000, then the highest price ever paid at auction for a painting in the United States.

Set in the modern era, the story follows the path to romance of fourteen-year-old Kajika Burnsworth, daughter of powerful industrialist Harry Burnsworth, owner of the Burnsworth international conglomerate giant. Kajika agrees to participate in a \\"marriage game\\" with her father, in which she must select her future husband out of three men that her father has supposedly preselected for her. Despite its sh≈çjo-romance undertones, the story itself evolves as a power political mystery involving a small, southeast Asian country called Raginei (purportedly near Malaysia). Raginei as a country is only 1,000 years old, but became extremely wealthy within the last 50 years or so due to a change in ideals implemented by past King Machaty that allowed the international export of oil. While Kajika searches for her suitors and puzzles over the concept of love, the country is thrown into political turmoil and Kajika's friendship with Prince Rumatti Ivan, as well as the Burnsworth relationship with Raginei, lands her right in the middle of it all. Plot Fourteen-year-old Kajika Burnsworth, daughter of powerful industrialist Harry Burnsworth, has spent the first part of her life living on an island in the Caribbean with a snow leopard named Mustafa. She is finally sent off to school in Japan, but is called away to her father's home in New York very soon after. While there, Kajika gets talked into the \\"marriage game\\" by her father. In this game, she has to meet and choose a possible future husband out of three males that her father has supposedly handpicked. He does not, however, tell her details regarding their identities and leaves it to Kajika to discover the bachelors on her own. According to the rules, if she picks one of the three men, Harry will tell Kajika her true destiny. Her childhood friend, Li Ren Huang, is charged with helping her on her mission while protecting her as her guardian. As leader of the powerful Huang family, Li Ren is most qualified for the task, though whether Li Ren is comfortable with helping Kajika find a husband remains to be seen. She first meets Eugene Alexandre De Volkan, a beautiful man whom she calls Mustafa because of his uncanny resemblance to the now dead snow leopard she once loved. Second is Prince Rumaty Ivan of Raginei, though Kajika takes a while to decide whether Rumaty is, in fact, one of the men her father selected for her. The third bachelor Kajika meets is Carl Rosenthal of the Rosenthal family and corporation, a Burnsworth competitor. Carl's father hates Harry Burnsworth, to the point where he becomes obsessed with discrediting him. Carl, on the other hand, finds room to be more forgiving, especially with the developing friendship between himself and the gentle, understanding Kajika Burnsworth. All three men are unique in their own ways and Kajika ends up liking each of them very much. As such, she does her best to make all of them a part of her life. Meanwhile, nearly a year after meeting Prince Rumaty, his country plummets into political turmoil and the King dies. Prince Rumaty is blamed for the King's death, despite his presence in another country during the event and he is banned from returning Raginei under the threat of death. Harry Burnsworth shelters Rumaty, leaving him in the care of Li Leng, who becomes somewhat of a tutor of diplomacy to him. The Prince grows up during his two years at the Burnsworth estate and eventually makes his move to re-enter the country and bring things back under control. Kajika, Li Ren, Eugene, and Carl Rosenthal get caught up in the country's troubles and all four of them are trapped within its borders when chaos breaks out. Li Ren is injured during a coup d'√©tat battle at the airport and he and Kajika are both sheltered by a Rumaty-supporting faction led by Isaac Noei, once a high- ranking officer in the Royal guard. No one is safe from danger. Officials are murdered, elite families are arrested, priests are framed, and even Noei's hideout is raided. Two pivotal events occur in Raginei that bring the story to climax. It is during the events in Raginei that Kajika realizes which man she loves most. Also, by the time Prince Rumaty reaches Raginei, Kajika's destiny is revealed to her and the \\"marriage game\\" is thus over.

Written by American attorney Francis L. Wellman, the book was first published in 1903 by The Macmillan Company, and was still in print more than 100 years later.  Author  Francis L. Wellman was a practicing attorney in New York State as well as an assistant district attorney in New York City. He dedicated the book to his two sons, hoping to encourage them to enter the legal profession. Wellmann compiled many examples of cross-examination techniques from colleagues and notable attorneys on celebrated cases. Notable references include such legal giants as Abraham Lincoln \\"in his twenty-three years\\" of trial practice prior to his political career (chapter IV), then-Judge Benjamin Cardozo (later a ground-breaking U.S. Supreme Court justice), U.S. Attorney General Benjamin Butler, the Vanderbilt family, and others. Well-known trial attorneys and their cross examination techniques are highlighted and interwoven with the stories of the day along with the prominent members of the legal profession, from New York City and also England. The book gives colorful, interesting facts on the trial participants; provides insights into various claims, disputes, marriage scandals; etc. The New York Times contrasted it with other, boring legal texts, and recommended it to both trial lawyers and non-lawyers for its entertainment value. It is filled with suspense regarding the outcomes of the compelling trials within the book. Equally suspenseful are the legal outcomes from the attempts of the attorneys to sway the juries with their erudition, wit, and charm.  Cross-Examination Topics  Some of the key topics covered include the following: * Cross-Examination of the Perjured Witness‚Äîchapter IV * Cross-Examination of Experts‚Äîchapter V * Silent Cross- Examination‚Äîchapter VII * Methods of Famous Cross-Examiners‚Äîchapter XIII * Dangers That Confront a Cross-Examiner‚Äîchapter XI * Fallacies of Testimony‚Äîchapter VIII In chapter VIII, Wellman reflects on the inconsistencies of statements during trials and also the basis for developing strong cross examination skills to uncover truths. He states: * \\"No one can frequent our courts of justice for any length of time without finding himself aghast at the daily spectacle presented by seemingly honest and intelligent men and women who array themselves upon opposite sides of a case and testify under oath to what appear to be absolutely contradictory statements of fact. It will be my endeavor in what follows to deal with this subject from its psychological point of few and to trace some of the causes of these unconscious mistakes of witnesses, so far as it is possible. The inquiry is most germane to what has preceded, for unless the advocate comprehends something of the sources of the fallacies of testimony, it surely would become a hopeless task for him to try to illuminate them by his cross-examinations.\\" * \\"It has been aptly said that 'Knowledge is only the impression of one's mind and not the fact itself, which may present itself to many minds in many different aspects.'\\" * \\"The unconscious sense impressions - sight, sound or touch - would be the same to every human mind; but once you awaken the mind to consciousness, then the original impression takes on all the color of motive, past experience, and character of the individual mind that receives it. The sensation by itself will always be the same. The variance arises when the sensation is interpreted by the individual and becomes a perception of his own mind.\\" The author thus indicates the challenging questions that should be put to a witness, questioning not merely their statement of facts, but motives, perceptions, misimpressions etc.  Trials  Some of the trials with cross- examination highlights in the book include the following: The cross- examination of Mrs. Reginald Vanderbilt by Herbert C. Smyth in the trial of Vanderbilt vs. Mrs. Harry Payne Whitney- to recover child custody. Leonard Kip Rhinelander vs. Alice Jones Fhinelander - for annulment action against his wife spurred by racial prejudice. Marie S. Livingston vs. Cecil Barret of Spencer Trask & Co. Cross examination by Lloyd Paul Stryker of the Barrets for nondisclosure that Ms. Livingston, a widow with five children, placed her stock in the hands of a broker she met at a social gathering. She was unwittingly allowing the firm to sell her stocks and then invest in a company owned by the firm. Though no damages were found, the plaintiff prevailed in having transactions reversed. There followed Wendt v. Fischer, 243 N. Y. 439, p. 443, where Judge Benjamin Cardozo is quoted as stating, \\"If dual interests are to be served, the disclosure to be effective must lay bare the truth, without any ambiguity or reservation, in all its stark significance.\\" The cross-examination of Ada and Phoebe Brush by George W. Whiteside - in their suit against two prominent Huntington, Long Island physicians, to recover damages for their ten-year incarceration in Kings Park State Hospital as insane patients. The cross-examination of Miss Martinez by the Hon. Joseph H. Choate for the defense, in the breach of promise case Martinez v. Del Valle. The cross-examination of Richard Pigott by Sir Charles Russell before the Parnell Commission. The cross-examination by Henry W. Taft of Dr. Charles Dana, Dr. Frederick Peterson and Dr. Smith Ely Jelliffe, expert witnesses in the litigation over the will of Andrew F. Kennedy.

The pre-Hispanic peoples that lived in actual Honduras were primarily polytheistic Maya and other native groups. In the 16th century, Roman Catholicism was introduced by the Spanish Empire. History=Ancient Religion= Mayan God Chaac in Copan sculture museum. The ancient Maya religion was an important religion in Copan (Honduras), between the fourth and seventh century AD. Other ancient religion is the Lenca religion that was still practiced by only few people during the XX century, the Lenca people religion was similar to the mayan one, with a large list of gods that the people workship. =Post-Colonial Religion= The first Roman Catholic mass celebrated in the continental New World was on August 14, 1502 in Punta Caxinas, which was two weeks after the supposed \\"discovery\\" of Honduras by Christopher Columbus. Since then, the Spanish began a process of converting and baptizing Honduran natives to the Catholic faith. Honduras holds a small part of the former Mosquito Coast which came under British influence‚Äînow in the extreme southeast of the state. Protestant churches gained following in that sparsely populated area on the Caribbean coast, especially Anglicanism and the Moravian Church. =20th century= Cathedral of saint Michael Archangel In recent years, the principal religious groups are Roman Catholic, Episcopal, Lutheran, Jehovah's Witness, Mennonite, approximately 300 evangelical Protestant groups, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon). The Catholic Church in Honduras is composed of eight dioceses: Tegucigalpa, Comayagua, Choluteca, Olancho, Yoro, San Pedro Sula, Trujillo and Cop√°n which are a part of the Conference Episcopal of Honduras. The Protestant churches are structured by three confederacies: The Pastors' Association of Honduras, the Evangelical Brotherhood of Honduras and the Apostolic Network of Honduras. Both the Roman Catholic Church as well as the Protestant churches, especially the Pentecostal denominations, have experienced growth thanks in large part to modern forms of mass communication in recent decades. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints built a temple in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, making it one of the six LDS temples in Central America. The most prominent evangelical churches in the country include the \\"Abundant Life\\", the \\"Living Love\\", and the Great Commission Churches. A growing number of evangelical churches have no denominational affiliation. The National Association of Evangelical Pastors represents the evangelical leadership. There are small numbers of Muslims and Jews. San Pedro Sula has a mosque and a synagogue, and Tegucigalpa has a synagogue. Statistics There are no reliable government statistics on religious affiliation in Honduras.International Religious Freedom Report 2008: Honduras. U.S. Department of State (2008). In a 2007 nationwide survey, CID- Gallup reported that: 47 percent of respondents identify themselves as Roman Catholic, 36 percent as evangelical Protestant, and 17 percent either provide no answer or consider themselves \\"other\\". Religious freedom Colonial Roman Catholic church in Duyure, Honduras Roman catholic church of San Juan in alt= The constitution of Honduras establishes the freedom of religion. The National Congress of Honduras has the power to legally recognize religious groups, which confers to them tax-exempt status and other privileges. The Catholic Church is the only organization legally recognized as a religious group, although other religious groups can register with the government as NGOs. Some religious groups have criticized this as constituting preferential treatment for the Catholic Church at the expense of other groups.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Honduras, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. The constitution prohibits religious leaders from holding elected office or publicly making political statements. Despite this, some Protestant pastors have been elected to government positions and serve on government advisory bodies. The government also frequently includes Catholic or Protestant prayers as part of official events and ceremonies, which has been criticized by representatives of other religious groups. Clergy are provided exemptions from being required to testify in court about information acquired from religious confessions. Vicars, bishops, and archbishops of the Catholic Church, as well as similarly high ranking members of other religions, are not required to appear in court if subpoenaed. Public schools are required to teach secular curricula. Private religious schools also operate in Honduras. Foreign missionaries must register with the government. Some religious groups have reached agreements with the government to expedite this process. Conscientious objection to military service is protected by law, including objection on religious grounds. Some politicians, generally from opposition parties, have regularly used antisemitism rhetoric in their political statements.

On 5 November 2019 President Ram Nath Kovind given his assent. Introduction And Presidential Assent The bill was drawn on the lines of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (for Maharashtra) and Karnataka Control of Organised Crime Act (for Karnataka). It was then sent to the office of the President of India for assent. In 2003 But The Then President Dr.A.P.J. Abdul Kalam didn't Give His Assent Because of Few Controversial Points Which Are Listed Below. # Delete Clause 16 - Clause 16 relates to the confession made before a police officer being admissible in court # Substitute the word \\"may\\" for \\"shall\\" after the words Special Court occurring in clause 20(2) and bring the proviso in line with the proviso to Section 43 D (2) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act(Amendment), 2008, - Clause 20 (2) deals with the extension of the detention period # Amend Clause 20(4) to bring it in conformity with Section 43 D (5) of the UAP (Amendment) Act - Clause 20 (4) deals with the powers of the court to grant bail. In July 2009, the bill was re-introduced in the state legislature without the changes suggested by the President So it failed To Get Passed.But in 2019 The Gujarat Control of Terrorism and Organised Crime (GCTOC) Bill passed by the Gujarat State Assembly has received President Ram Nath Kovind's assent. The Bill which was formulated in 2003 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was Chief Minister of the State had been sent for presidential clearance three times. Each time it was rejected over a few controversial provisions. The Bill found success in its fourth attempt, when President Kovind gave his assent on 7 November 2019, almost 16 years after it was first introduced. It was termed controversial for two key features: intercepted telephone conversations would be considered legitimate evidence and a confession made before a police officer would also be considered documented evidence. President Ram Nath Kovind has passed both provisions. The law provides for the constitution of a special court along with the appointment of special public prosecutors to handle organised crime cases. Furthermore, assets acquired through organised crime can be auctioned and the transfer of assets can be cancelled. The new law states that any act intended to disrupt law and order, public order or endanger the unity, integrity and security of the State or to spread terror in the minds of sections of people will fall into the category of terrorism. The new law is formulated to deal with terrorism and organised crime such as contract killing, ponzi schemes, the narcotics trade, extortion rackets, cybercrime, land-grabbing and human trafficking. According to the Ministry, the new law has a provision that allows up to life imprisonment for cases involving crimes listed above. Additionally, if a death occurs in these crimes, capital punishment could apply.  Human Rights Issue  The Bill got an outright rejection from President A.P.J Abdul Kalam.

Various minority religious groups are also present on the island. The constitution of Dominica establishes the freedom of religion, which is broadly respected by both the government and general society.  Demographics  According to the 2001 population and housing census, approximately 61 percent of Dominica's population is Roman Catholic.International Religious Freedom Report 2008: Dominica. U.S. Department of State (2008). Followers of evangelical churches represent 18 percent of the population, Seventh-day Adventists 6 percent, and Methodists 3.7 percent.

Sodium peroxide (Na2O2) is used to oxidize the sample that becomes soluble in a diluted acid solution. This method allows complete dissolution of numerous refractory compounds like chromite, magnetite, ilmenite, rutile, and even silicon, carbides, alloys, noble metals and materials with high sulfide contents. Peroxide fusion can be performed either manually or with automated systems. The latter have the advantage of increasing productivity, improving safety, maintaining repeatable preparation conditions, and avoiding spattering as well as cross- contamination. Peroxide fusion vs. other dissolution methods Acid digestion is the most common dissolution method used for many types of samples. Unfortunately, acid digestion involves numerous manipulations of concentrated acids. Some types of samples even require the use of perchloric acid (HClO4) that is explosive when it comes into contact with any organic materials. It can be readily combined with hydrofluoric acid (HF) and brought to a fumic state to drive off this volatile acid that is extremely dangerous to human health, not to mention it will dissolve the walls of any glass container it is being processed within. Moreover, it is often difficult to get full dissolution of the sample, even when using these hazardous chemicals. References * Enzweiler,J., Potts,P. and Jarvis,K. 1995.

Sadowski batted left- handed, threw right-handed, stood tall and weighed during his active career. Nicknamed \\"Bo\\", Sadowski's big league career coincided somewhat with a namesake, pitcher Robert Sadowski (no relation). Bo Sadowski signed with his hometown St. Louis Cardinals (the team that first signed pitcher Sadowski as well) in 1955 and made his debut (and only) appearance for the Redbirds on September 16, 1960, when he grounded out and walked against Stu Miller of the San Francisco Giants during a 6‚Äì2 defeat at Busch Stadium. Following the 1960 campaign, he was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies, who recalled him from the Buffalo Bisons of the Triple-A International League for a more extended 16-game trial during 1961. But Sadowski batted only .130 in 54 at bats, and was traded again the following off-season, this time in a multiple-player transaction to the Chicago White Sox. Sadowski spent the full 1962‚Äì63 seasons in the American League. With the 1962 White Sox, he batted .231 with six home runs and 24 runs batted in in 130 at bats, but was outrighted to the ChiSox' Indianapolis Indians affiliate at season's end. Selected during the Rule 5 draft that November, he spent the 1963 season with the Los Angeles Angels, where he hit .250 with a home run and 22 RBI. Sadowski returned to the minor leagues in 1964, and played six more years, almost exclusively at the Triple-A level, for several organizations. As a major leaguer, Sadowski batted .222 with seven homers and 46 RBI, but he was a solid .267 hitter in almost 1,400 games played as a minor leaguer. Following his playing career, he spent one season, 1972, as a manager at the Class A level in the Minnesota Twins' farm system. Sadowski died in January 2017 at the age of 79.

Interior of Japan-market Toyota Crown Athlete with G-Book touchscreen capability One of the features offered exclusively on G-Book mX is Probe Communication Traffic Information. According to the press release from Toyota dated April 10, 2007, \\"This unique Toyota traffic information service gathers driving data ‚Äì such as speed and position ‚Äì from vehicles equipped with G-Book mX to provide drivers with alternate routes for avoiding traffic congestion. Because it makes use of the on-board DCM (data communications module), the information gathering capability of this service is superior to similar systems, which rely solely on cell phones, and efficiently stores information about traffic congestion in real time at the G-Book Center. In this way the Probe Communication Traffic Information service supplements Vehicle Information and Communication System (VICS) information with updates on traffic congestion, providing drivers with highly accurate predictions about the current traffic situation and suggestions for the best alternate routes to take.\\" This feature is being marketed as an ability to drive eco-friendly, by helping to avoid pollution created by cars idling in traffic and allowing the driver to reach their destination sooner, and affording the opportunity to turn the car off, limiting emissions being added to the atmosphere. The wireless communications for Japan-market cars are handled by the DCM and transmits and receives information on the wireless network owned by Japanese telecommunications provider KDDI Corporation headquartered in Okinawa. The cellular platform used is the CDMA2000 1x (CDMA 1X) method, and it is possible to receive up to 144kbit/s data. The same DCM is used for China-market models, thus the network provider for China-market G-Book services is China Telecom. Map updates and music downloads are not available for China-market G-Book-enabled cars, and traffic information is only available in Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. G-Book Alpha Pro, mX Pro DCM-only, and CDMA2000 1xEV-DO (CDMA 1X WIN) can send up to 2.4Mbit/s of data, and the DCM supports hands-free calls. The DCM model is also equipped with its own GPS receiver and features, to track a stolen vehicle, and it also has an emergency notification ability to transmit the location of airbag deployment. =Secure Digital (SD) card-compatible terminal= According to a press release from Toyota dated August 28, 2002 \\"Navigational maps and the on-board terminal's basic software are stored in a Secure Digital (SD) card. The card can be inserted into \\"E-TOWER\\" terminals at convenience stores and other locations to download local or new maps or to upgrade the on-board terminal's basic software. Music and games can also be downloaded, and the SD card is compatible with commercially available audio players, digital cameras and PDAs that use SD cards, making it possible to share content such as music files, images and games.\\" E-Tower locations can be found at numerous locations, including Circle K of Japan. G-Link Japanese- market Lexus GS 450h with G-Link equipped touchscreen system. Offered at Lexus' Japanese domestic market launch in 2005, G-Link is the proprietary Lexus telematics system for the Japanese market. G-Link has a different software configuration versus G-Book, particularly in its link to the 24-hour Lexus Owner's Desk hotline, and is offered standard for the first three years of ownership. Other aspects of the system at its 2005 launch were based on G-Book Alpha capabilities. The G-Link software runs off of the vehicle's hard disc drive navigation system and song library, and includes traffic updates, HelpNet compatibility, and the G-Security service. The G-Security service includes cellphone notification of vehicle lock and position status. A G-Sound music distribution service offers samples and downloading to the vehicle's hard disc drive of MP3s from different genres. A U.S. equivalent of the G-Link system with similar but not identical functionality, called Lexus Enform with Safety Connect, was launched in 2009. In 2006, Japanese media reported that a Lexus-branded cellphone was also being produced with compatibility for the G-Link system. This cellphone service would be produced in conjunction with the KDDI telecommunications service provider, and is called \\"au\\", using Apple and Sony products. Related versions Toyota is working with other Japanese car manufacturers, such as Mitsubishi, Subaru and Daihatsu to provide the service in the Japanese language. Mazda has also agreed to offer the service in Japan, with an intent to install the service starting with the 2005 model. Competing services are called \\"Nissan Car Wings\\", and Internavi \\"Internavi Premium Club (Japanese)\\" by Honda. In the U.S., the Safety Connect system was produced based on the G-Book system architecture, with similar functionality, along with an expanded Lexus Enform service. The G-Book feature is similar to \\"W44T\\" offered in Japan by Toshiba, and \\"Pipit\\" in an agreement with Toyota and Willcom in Japan.

His regular singing partner was the soprano Lois Hunt. Early life and career Wrightson was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of a Methodist minister. He studied voice at a local conservatory and then moved to New York City in the 1930s to study voice with baritone Robert Weede, who sang with the Metropolitan Opera. Wrightson's first job in New York was as a page for NBC. He married Alta Markey, and the pair had a daughter, Wendy. Wrightson separated from his wife, although they never divorced.Collins, Glenn. \\"Earl Wrightson, 77; Baritone Sang Leads In Touring Musicals\\", The New York Times, March 9, 1993 Wrightson with Beverly Tyler in The Firebrand of Florence Wrightson lent his deep baritone voice to the radio, singing regularly on such series as The Prudential Family Hour and The Coca-Cola Hour, often for conductor Andre Kostelanetz. In 1944, he played Robert on Broadway in The New Moon. The following year, he had his only starring role on Broadway in The Firebrand of Florence.\\"Earl Wrightson\\" at the IBDB database Unfortunately, the Kurt Weill and Ira Gershwin musical was a flop, lasting only 43 performances.

By the late 1940s, Wrightson performed on television variety shows, including Girl About Town and hosted his own 15-minute variety show, Earl Wrightson at Home on CBS Television.\\"Earl Wrightson\\" at the Internet Accuracy Project, accessed July 28, 2009 Beginning in 1951, Wrightson's regular singing partner was opera soprano Lois Hunt, with whom he developed an intimate relationship. She had listened to his radio shows as a teenager and became a frequent performer on his television variety show. He won an Emmy Award as the host, for three years in the 1950s, of a CBS Sunday afternoon television show, The American Musical Theater. He also performed on other variety shows, such as Paul Whiteman's Goodyear Revue, and he was heard on shows hosted by Robert Q. Lewis, Jack Paar, Merv Griffin, Mike Douglas and Johnny Carson. Later years In the 1960s, Wrightson made several appearances on The Bell Telephone Hour, especially on their annual Christmas programs. Wrightson and Hunt continued to perform Broadway show tunes with symphony orchestras in concerts throughout the U.S., including appearances at Carnegie Hall. While performing at the Shoreham Hotel in Washington, D.C. in the early 1960s, they received an invitation sent on behalf of Lady Bird Johnson to perform at her home for the wives of a group of Japanese government officials who would be attending meetings at the White House. While visiting the Johnsons' residence the evening before their performance, the singers were invited upstairs to meet the vice president. According to Hunt, Lyndon Johnson, suffering from a cold, greeted them \\"in his green silk pajamas with his initials, LBJ, embroidered from just below his shoulder to just above his ankle\\".DeNicola, Linda. \\"An uncommon woman, an uncommon life: Opera singer Lois Hunt now lives a quiet life in Roosevelt\\" , Tri-Town News, January 22, 2004.

The amount of dopant necessary to cause changes is typically very low. When doped into crystalline substances, the dopant's atoms get incorporated into its crystal lattice. The crystalline materials are frequently either crystals of a semiconductor such as silicon and germanium for use in solid-state electronics, or transparent crystals for use in the production of various laser types; however, in some cases of the latter, noncrystalline substances such as glass can also be doped with impurities. In solid-state electronics using the proper types and amounts of dopants in semiconductors is what produces the p-type semiconductors and n-type semiconductors that are essential for making transistors and diodes. Transparent crystals= Lasing media = The procedure of doping tiny amounts of the metals chromium (Cr), neodymium (Nd), erbium (Er), thulium (Tm), ytterbium (Yb), and a few others, into transparent crystals, ceramics, or glasses is used to produce the active medium for solid-state lasers. It is in the electrons of the dopant atoms that a population inversion can be produced, and this population inversion is essential for the stimulated emission of photons in the operation of all lasers. In the case of the natural ruby, what has occurred is that a tiny amount of chromium dopant has been naturally distributed through a crystal of aluminium oxide (corundum). This chromium both gives a ruby its red color, and also enables a ruby to undergo a population inversion and act as a laser. The aluminium and oxygen atoms in the transparent crystal of aluminium oxide served simply to support the chromium atoms in a good spatial distribution, and otherwise, they do not have anything to do with the laser action. In other cases, such as in the neodymium YAG laser, the crystal is synthetically made and does not occur in nature. The man-made yttrium aluminium garnet crystal contains millions of yttrium atoms in it, and due to its physical size, chemical valence, etc., it works well to take the place of a small minority of yttrium atoms in its lattice, and to replace them with atoms from the rare-earth series of elements, such as neodymium. Then, these dopant atoms actually carry out the lasing process in the crystal. The rest of the atoms in the crystal consist of yttrium, aluminium, and oxygen atoms, but just as above, these other three elements function to simply support the neodymium atoms. In addition, the rare-earth element erbium can readily be used as the dopant rather than neodymium, giving a different wavelength of its output. In many optically-transparent hosts, such active centers may keep their excitation for a time on the order of milliseconds, and relax with stimulated emission, providing the laser action. The amount of dopant is usually measured in atomic percent. Usually the relative atomic percent is assumed in the calculations, taking into account that the dopant ion can substitute in only part of a site in a crystalline lattice. The doping can be also used to change the refraction index in optical fibers, especially in the double-clad fibers. The optical dopants are characterized with lifetime of excitation and the effective absorption and emission cross-sections, which are main parameters of an active dopant. Usually, the concentration of optical dopant is of order of few percent or even lower. At large density of excitation, the cooperative quenching (cross- relaxation) reduces the efficiency of the laser action. = Examples = The medical field has some use for erbium-doped laser crystals for the laser scalpels that are used in laser surgery. Europium, neodymium, and other rare- earth elements are used to dope glasses for lasers. Holmium-doped and neodymium yttrium aluminium garnets (YAGs) are used as the active laser medium in some laser scalpels. Phosphors and scintillators In context of phosphors and scintillators, dopants are better known as activators, and are used to enhance the luminescence process.  Semiconductors  The addition of a dopant to a semiconductor, known as doping, has the effect of shifting the Fermi levels within the material. This results in a material with predominantly negative (n-type) or positive (p-type) charge carriers depending on the dopant variety. Pure semiconductors that have been altered by the presence of dopants are known as extrinsic semiconductors (see intrinsic semiconductor). Dopants are introduced into semiconductors in a variety of techniques: solid sources, gases, spin on liquid, and ion implanting. See ion implantation, surface diffusion, and solid sources footnote.  Others  The color of some gemstones is caused by dopants. For example, ruby and sapphire are both aluminium oxide, the former getting its red color from chromium atoms, and the latter doped with any of several elements, giving a variety of colors.

Hacker conferences CTF competition at DEF CON 17 A hacker conference, also known as a hacker con, is a convention for hackers. These serve as meeting places for phreakers, hackers, and security professionals. The actual events, time-spans, and details of various themes of these conventions not only depends on the specific convention attended but also its perceived reputation. Typically the actual details of any given convention are couched in mild secrecy due to the legality of certain panels, as well as the willingness of attendees to explain themselves to law enforcement and less computer-savvy individuals (see hacker definition controversy). Common topics include wardriving, lockpicking, corporate and network security, personal rights and freedoms, new technologies, as well as general 'geek' motifs. Some may also have contests and general collaborative events such as hackathons. A variety of electronic and non-electronic hacker conference badges One facet of Hacker conferences that tends to differentiate many \\"HackerCons\\" from general computer security conferences, is the evolution of the conference badge. While many conferences use a fairly standard paper/plastic badge to identify attendees by name, many hacker con's have evolved to use more non-traditional badges, such as electronic PCB's with LED's, LCD screens, and can include wifi and advanced, often hidden functionality, to include games, that do not identify the individual, sometimes promoting a group identity or regional/local group affiliation. This has spurred the creation of so-called \\"badgelife\\" where different individuals and organizations (such as local hacker groups) may design, create, and sell or otherwise distribute a separate badge attendees wear in addition to their conference badge. These badges may be purchased, but some may have to be earned by completing a challenge at the conference. One of the rarest and most desirable badges is the DefCon Black Badge.

Luk√°cs quotes Novalis at the top of the essay, \\"Philosophy is really homesickness‚Äîthe desire to be everywhere at home.\\" The essay unfolds closely related to this notion of Novalis‚Äîthat modern philosophy \\"mourns the absence of a pre-subjective, pre-reflexive anchoring of reason\\" and is searching to be grounded but cannot achieve this aim due to philsophy's modern discursive nature. In Theory of the Novel, with regards to literature, Luk√°cs suggests that the era of Homerian epics, was characterized by a \\"closed totality\\" where the pre-reflexive hero is connected to a cosmic destiny (a home of the soul) so that loneliness is transformed into a solid position in the universe. In the modern novel, however, the subject is without ties to the eternal and thus loneliness is more pronounced‚Äîthe loneliness of a soul that cannot find a cosmic (transcendental) home.

Recently the government has expanded the road facilities connecting Ulagampatti to the National Highways. About Nagarathars Nagarathar business people are Hindus, predominantly originating in the Chettinad region of Tamil Nadu. They have been trading with Southeast Asia since the heyday of the Chola empire, but in the 19th Century they migrated to countries throughout Southeast Asia. (See Tamil diaspora) Nagarathars, (also known as Chettiars), were an important trading class of 19th and 20th century South East Asia and spread to Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Malaysia, Singapore, Java, Sumatra, and Ho Chi Minh City. Changing political and economic situations since that time have caused many of these communities to disappear as their members returned to India or sought other, more hospitable homes. Chettiars were traditionally involved in occupations like moneylending and wholesale trading. Banks established by Chettiars include the now defunct Bank of Chettinad, and the now ICICI merged Bank of Madura founded by Karumuttu Thiagarajan Chettiar (an architect par excellence, textile don, highly principled educationist and philanthropist), Indian Overseas Bank founded by Shri. M. Ct. M. Chidambaram Chettiar, and Indian Bank founded by Raja Annamalai Chettiar. Nagarathars are known for their philanthropy; building temples, and schools and maintaining them throughout Asia.

The P.74 was unsuccessful and it and the Oryx were cancelled. Design and development The engine was developed by the Aero Gas Turbine Division of Napier in conjunction with Percival, later Hunting Percival. Funding came from the Ministry of Supply. The Percival P.74 was a design for a tipjet-powered helicopter. The jet power was to be supplied from engines within the helicopter and piped to the rotor tips. Napier developed the Oryx specifically to power the P.74. The output gas temperature from the engines had to be below 400 ¬∞C for the helicopter's stainless steel rotor ducts, so a bypass design was used. This also blew \\"cold\\" air from the compressor, rather than purely hot turbine exhaust gas. In order to give a compact installation, rather than using an oversized compressor with a bypass around the turbine (as commonly used in the turbofan engine), the Oryx used an auxiliary compressor coupled to the turbine. This was mounted behind the turbine, with its gas flow in the opposite direction to the main engine core. The two gas streams were deflected through 90¬∞ in a collector chamber, then exited vertically upwards. Gas flow through this collector was arranged so that each stream remained separate, the cold air from the auxiliary compressor passing through a bifurcated duct, so as to wrap around the hotter turbine outlet. By this means, the duct was further protected from the hot exhaust. Separator plates inside each duct split the stream into a number of flows and deflected each one separately, thus preserving the flows approximately constant across the whole duct. When the flows finally merged, they were flowing parallel and at approximately the same velocity, thus reducing turbulence and energy loss. A starting valve, consisting of a Corliss non-throttling rotating valve in combination with a butterfly valve (closed in flight),A typical \\"butterfly\\" valve restricts flow somewhat, even when completely open could divert individual engine output to the outside of the aircraft, permitting engine starting and ground running with the rotor stationary. Without the valve, back pressure in the duct and rotor system would prevent the starting of the engine. In the P.74 the two Oryx engines fed their outputs to a common duct that took the thrust to the rotor head. Development of the engine began in 1951. The engine was designed with a 12-stage axial flow compressor less than nine inches (19 cm) in diameter and a set of nine tie rods around the periphery of the compressor discs linking them together. Air from the compressor was fed to an array of five tubular combustion chambers, with the resulting hot gas driving a two- stage turbine connected to the four-stage auxiliary compressor via geared couplings. The first Oryx prototype engine was started for the first time in November 1953 and about 1,400 hours of test running had been achieved by the end of July 1955. The Oryx was expected to be used for the planned commercial P.105 development of the P.74. In the P.105 the two engines would have been fitted back to front on either side of the rotor mast, feeding their outputs to the rotor hub. It was anticipated that 900 \\"gas horsepower\\" could be produced in its developed form.

Esarhaddon then entered northern Egypt but was repulsed by Taharqa's forces. The second battle of 671 BC saw Taharqa retreat with his army to Memphis; Memphis was taken with Taharqa then fleeing to the Kingdom of Kush.

Early attempts at human-powered flight were unsuccessful because of the difficulty of achieving the high power-to-weight ratio. Prototypes often used ornithopter principles which were not only too heavy to meet this requirement but aerodynamically unsatisfactory. Human-powered aircraft have been successfully flown over considerable distances. However, they are still primarily constructed as engineering challenges rather than for any kind of recreational or utilitarian purpose. First attempts In 1904, Scientific American published an article and a photograph of a bicycle plane built by Steward Winslow of Riparia, Washington. He attempted to fly his plane on 30 July 1904, but one of the wheels failed.Camas Prairie Chronicle (Cottonwood, Idaho), August 5, 1904 An early human-powered aircraft was the Gerhardt Cycleplane, developed by W. Frederick Gerhardt at McCook Field in Dayton, Ohio in 1923. The aircraft had seven wings stacked nearly high. The pilot pedaled a bicycle gear that turned the propeller. In early tests the craft was towed into the air by an automobile, and released. With Gerhardt as the pilot, the Cycleplane was able to maintain stable, level flight for short durations.Cornelisse (2002) Its only human-powered takeoff was a short hop of with the craft rising . Zaschka's Human-Power Aircraft, Berlin 1934 In 1934, Engelbert Zaschka from Germany completed a large human-powered aircraft, the Zaschka Human-Power Aircraft. On 11 July 1934, the Zaschka-HPA flew about 20 meters on the Berlin Tempelhof Airport; the HPA took off without assisted takeoff.Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum Washington: Zaschka Human- Power Aircraft (1934)Lange, Bruno (1970). Das Buch der deutschen Luftfahrttechnik. Verlag Dieter Hoffmann, p. 361. A craft called HV-1 Mufli (de) (Muskelkraft-Flugzeug) built by Helmut H√§ssler and Franz Villinger (de) first flew on 30 August 1935: a distance of 235 metres at Halle an der Saale. 120 flights were made, the longest being 712 metres in 1937. However, it was launched using a tensioned cable and so was not strictly human- powered.\\"Airplane Flown by Man Power is Pedaled Like a Bicycle\\" Popular Mechanics, December 1935 bottom pg. 855 In March 1937, a team of Enea Bossi (designer), Vittorio Bonomi (builder), and Emilio Casco (pilot) met a challenge by the Italian government for a flight of one kilometre using their Pedaliante. The aircraft apparently flew short distances fully under human power, but the distances were not significant enough to win the competition's prize. Furthermore, there has been much dispute whether it ever took off under the pedal-power of the pilot alone, in particular because there is no record of official observation of it having done so. Some arguments for and against the validity of Bossi's claim to have done so are presented by Sherwin (1976). At the time the fully human-powered flights were deemed to be a result of the pilot's significant strength and endurance; and ultimately not attainable by a typical human. As with the HV-1 Mufli, additional attempts were therefore made using a catapult system. By being catapulted to a height of 9 metres (30 ft), the aircraft met the distance requirement of but was declined the prize due to the launch method.Pedaliante First flights right The first officially authenticated take-off and landing of a man-powered aircraft (one capable of powered take-offs, unlike a glider) was made on 9 November 1961 by Derek Piggott in Southampton University's Man Powered Aircraft (SUMPAC) at Lasham Airfield. 1962 video document on the subject, filmed by British Path√© The best flight out of 40 attempts was 650 metres. The SUMPAC was substantially rebuilt by Imperial College with a new transmission system but was damaged beyond repair in November 1965. The Hatfield Puffin first flew on 16 November 1961, one week after SUMPAC. The Hatfield Man Powered Aircraft Club was formed of employees of de Havilland Aircraft Company and had access to company support. Eventually its best distance was .Taylor 1962, p. 151. John Wimpenny said he was very pleased with the performance of the Puffin, which handled beautifully during the flight.The Guardian, 5 May 1962, front page His record stood for 10 years. Puffin 2 was a new fuselage and wing around the transmission recovered from the original Puffin. It flew on 27 August 1965 and made several flights over a half-mile, including a climb to 5.2 metres. After Puffin 2 was damaged, it was handed over to Liverpool University who used it to build the Liverpuffin. After this date several less successful aircraft flew, until 1972 when the Woodford Essex Aircraft Group's Jupiter, designed and built by Chris Roper, piloted by John Potter flew 1,070 metres and 1,239 metres in June 1972. Due to Roper's ill health, the project was later continued at RAF Halton - Potter was a serving Royal Air Force (RAF) officer at the time. In early 1977, a Japanese aircraft Stork completed three-quarters of the figure eight course before grounding a wingtip.  Royal Aeronautical Society Human Powered Flight Group  The Royal Aeronautical Society's \\"Man Powered Aircraft Group\\" was formed in 1959 by the members of the Man Powered Group of the College of Aeronautics at Cranfield when they were invited to join the Society. Its title was changed from \\"Man\\" to \\"Human\\" in 1988 because of the many successful flights made by female pilots. Under the auspices of the Society, in 1959 the industrialist Henry Kremer offered the first Kremer Prizes of ¬£5,000 for the first human-powered aircraft to fly a figure-of-eight course round two markers half-a-mile apart. It was conditional that the designer, entrant pilot, place of construction and flight must all be British. In 1973 Kremer increased the prize to ¬£50,000 and opened it to all nationalities, to stimulate interest. Kremer Prize successes by Gossamer Condor and Albatross In 1973, Kremer increased his prize money tenfold to ¬£50,000. At that time, the human-powered aircraft had flown only in straight (or nearly straight) line courses, and no- one had yet even attempted his more challenging figure-eight course, which required a fully controllable aircraft. He also opened the competition to all nationalities; previously it was restricted to British entries only. On 23 August 1977, the Gossamer Condor 2 flew the first figure-eight, a distance of 2.172 km winning the first Kremer prize. It was built by Dr Paul B. MacCready and piloted by amateur cyclist and hang-glider pilot Bryan Allen. Although slow, cruising at only , it achieved that speed with only .Flight International 1977 p1254 The second Kremer prize of ¬£100,000 was won on June 12, 1979, again by Paul MacCready, when Bryan Allen flew MacCready's Gossamer Albatross from England to France: a straight distance of 35.82 km (22 miles 453 yards) in 2 hours, 49 minutes.

Further prizes of ¬£5,000 are awarded to each subsequent entrant improving the speed by at least five percent. Over the next four years, the MIT group continued to evolve their designs, with the Monarch and Monarch-B aircraft succeeded by three follow-on designs, the Light Eagle and two MIT Daedalus aircraft, the Daedalus-87 and Daedalus-88.

The first cup was won by Airglow, designed by John and Mark McIntyre. The Icarus Cup is different from the Kremer Prize in that it doesn't aim to simply break speed and distance records, but making human powered flying into a popular sport. Therefore, the competition includes challenges such as a slalom course, an unaided starting task and a landing accuracy test. The Icarus Cup is held annually at Lasham Airfield, Great Britain, the site of the first human- powered flight. Airships Inventors have built human-powered airships.

It was one of the most popular classical rhetoric topics,Ernst Robert Curtius, European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages, trans. W.R.

Consolatio as a literary genre The Consolatio literary tradition (\\"consolation\\" in English) is a broad literary genre encompassing various forms of consolatory speeches, essays, poems, and personal letters. This literary tradition flourished in antiquity, and its origins date back to the fifth century BC. Orators in antiquity often delivered consolatory speeches to comfort mourners at funerals or in cases of public mourning. Friends wrote personal letters consoling each other on the loss of a loved one. These were often highly personal and emotional. In addition to personal offerings of solace, Consolatio works also include philosophical treatises on grief. These works are usually more detached in tone, and many are written in essay format. Many ancient poets even wrote verse in this distinct Consolatio style. These consolatory works are all called Consolatio because of their similar arguments, topoi, and distinctive rhetorical appeals. Only fragments of early Consolatio works survive, and it is not until Cicero's Tusculan Disputations, Seneca's Ad Marciam, and Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy that a unified character appears. Scholars often view these works as the bedrock of the formal Consolatio tradition. (Fournier, introduction) Defining characteristics All Consolatio works draw from a relatively narrow range of arguments aimed at offering solace, to allay the distress caused by the death of a loved one, a matter of ill fortuna. The conventional opening of a Consolatio was All must die. The most typical arguments characterizing the Consolatio genre were: \\"All must die; even the oldest must die; the youngest too must die, and this is as one with the death of the old.\\"Scourfield, JHD. \\"Consolation.\\" Oxford Classical Dictionary. N.d. Print. Path: Consolatio; Kassel quote: \\"Death brings release from the miseries of life; time heals all griefs; future ills should be prepared for; the deceased was only ‚Äòlent‚Äô--be grateful for having possessed him. Normally grief is regarded as natural and legitimate, though not to be indulged in.\\" In the post-classical period, an additional Christian consolation was developed. Consolatio works are united by their treatment of bereavement, by unique rhetorical structure and topoi, and by their use of universal themes to offer solace. Ancient history Some scholars claim the genre arose from the Sophist belief in the healing power of discourse. Others believe it arose as a response to passages of grief found in the works of the Greek poet Homer. Although several ancient writings contain elements of the Consolatio tradition, it was the Academic Crantor of Soli (c. 325- c. 275BC), a member of Plato‚Äôs Academy, who first constructed his works in a distinct Consolatio Tradition. Although only fragments of his essays have survived, his influence is noted in the works of later writers, particularly Cicero‚Äôs Tusculan Disputations and Plutarch‚Äôs Consolation to Apollonius. Crantor advocated metriopatheia, a tactic for dealing with strong emotions.Baltussen, Han. \\"Personal grief and public mourning in Plutarch's consolation to his wife\\", American Journal of Philology 130 (2009): 67-67. July-Aug. 2009. :\\" Introduction: Beginnings of consolation.\\" Cicero‚Äôs Consolatio is widely accepted as the distinct work that transmitted the earlier Consolatio literary tradition to the Romans of the late Republic. In the Early Imperial Age, most Consolatio works were constructed within the framework of Stoicism. Seneca the Younger produced the most recognizable examples of Consolatio in his three Consolations, Ad Marciam, Ad Polybium, and Ad Helviam Matrem. The most recognizable example of Consolatio in verse form was written by the pseudo- Ovidian, Consolatio ad Liviam. In Boethius‚Äô Consolation of Philosophy, Philosophy herself consoles the author in his sore straits. Other notable examples of the Consolatio tradition from Antiquity: Pontus 4.11 in Ovid's Letters from the Black Sea, Statius‚Äô poem consoling Abascantus on his wife‚Äôs death, Apollonius of Tyana, the Emperor Julian, and Libanius. Libanius was also the author of the funeral orations consoling mourners after the death of the Emperor Julian. The Plutarchian Corpus includes three works constructed in the Consolatio tradition: De exilio, Consolatio ad uxorem, Consolatio ad Apollonium. Reception and influence The Consolatio genre, particularly its distinct tone and topoi, widely influenced other literary genres. Elements of the Consolatio tradition can be found in a plethora of later works, and the tradition continued through the Middle Ages and into the early modern era.Kierdorf, Wilhelm (K√∂ln); \\"Consolatio as a literary genre.\\" Brill's New Pauly. Antiquity volumes edited by: Hubert Cancik and Helmuth Schneider . Brill, 2009. Brill Online. University of California UC Berkeley CDL. 20 July 2009 Consolatio tradition In the Middle Ages Christian ideology taught that the distress, and death itself, were punishments for Adam's fall, while conceding that the tribulations of life could be vehicles of divine correction. A return to the ancient view commenced with Petrarch, though the Quattrocento humanist Coluccio Salutati could only offer the solace of friendships and a sense of duty. The 'art of mourning' 's general revival was expressed in many consolatory letters that circulated in manuscript and were soon printed. Among them Gianozzo Manetti's \\"bitter dialogue\\" Antonini, dilectissimi filii sui, morte consolatorius (1438) took the new intimate view of grieving, and Francesco Filelfo offered an extensive compendium of Christian and Classical consolations in his consolatory oration for Antonio Marcello on the death of his son (1461). Marilyn Aronberg Lavin reads Piero della Francesca's gnomic Flagellation of Christ (c 1455-60) as a consolatio of two friends (portrayed) who had each recently lost a son. Laurence Sterne parodied Consolatio and solemn authors in his comic novel Tristram Shandy.

Hidehito's empress aunt was expected to occupy the throne until her nephew would be able to take on the burden of responsibility.

Emperor Go-Momozono became deathly ill in 1779, and having no heir to the throne this created a potential succession crisis. Go- Sakuramachi consulted with the senior courtiers and imperial guards, and planned to accept Prince Sadayoshi of Fushimi-no-miya as an adopted son. For one reason or another the choice went instead to Prince Morohito, who was a member of the Kanin branch of the Imperial family. Morohito was the sixth son of Prince Kan'in-no-miya Sukehito (ÈñëÈô¢ÂÆÆÂÖ∏‰ªÅ), and was supported by the Emperor's chief advisor (aka the Kampaku). Go-Momozono hastily adopted Prince Morohito, who became Emperor K≈çkaku upon his death. After the throne had switched to that branch of the imperial line, Go-Sakuramachi came to be referred to as the Guardian of the Young Lord, referred to the Emperor. The largest event that took place before her death occurred in 1789, when she admonished K≈çkaku for his role in a scandal involving his father's honorary title.

She is also credited with creating a book called , which consists of poems Imperial letters and Imperial chronicles. Although there were seven other reigning empresses, their successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal Imperial bloodline. For this reason, scholars have shown that these reigns were temporary, and argued that the male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century.\\"Life in the Cloudy Imperial Fishbowl,\\" Japan Times. 27 March 2007.

His sister was married to PrinceTurki bin Abdul Aziz, one of the brothers of Saudi King Fahd al Saud. Al Fassi's notoriety stems largely from his 1978 purchase (for $2.4 million in cash) of the 38-room white-stucco Whittier Mansion on Sunset Blvd., Beverly Hills, which, soon after its acquisition, he had painted an unpopular shade of green. He further decorated the grounds of his new home by having the publicly visible statuary around the property painted in flesh tones, with pubic hair also colorfully painted, raising the ire of many of his neighbors.Ruth Ryon, Article in LA Times, June 2, 1985 In 1979 the mansion was used as a filming location for The Jerk starring Steve Martin.Frank W. Martin, Article in \\"People\\" Jan 1980 Within two years of its purchase, just after midnight on 1/2/81, the house was completely destroyed by a fire which was set by individuals burglarizing the house. The crowd that gathered to watch the spectacular fire, was characterized by amazement at how the inside wood, under the copper roof installed by the so- called Sheik, did not allow the Beverly Hills Firefighters to enter from above. Afterward, when the fire was put down, the mansion was gutted. No one there cheered but may have been relieved that the awful edifice, which had exerted such a poor, kitch influence on the other owners of the nearby homes along Sunset Boulevard, was gone. Eventually in 2010, the home was replaced by two new homes, reflecting the other attractive homes in the area. Al Fassi soon relocated to Miami, joining other members of the Saudi royal family already there, and already provoking notoriety with helicopter commuting and large and unusual charitable contributions. Among his exploits there were disputes over fencing he erected on city property, the hiring of city police officers to serve as security guards, a lawsuit from a contractor for unpaid bills, and a dust-up over a proposed Big Ben-style clock to be built on Star Island in Biscayne Bay.Gregory Jaynes, Article in New York Times, May 27, 1982 Al Fassi had mixed success as an animal lover; he was known to have adopted scores of stray cats, and to have purchased live birds, fish, and even lobsters in order to set them free, but he was also charged with animal cruelty when investigators from the Greater Miami Humane Society found evidence of neglect.Noaki Schwartz, Article in Broward County Sun-Sentinel Jan. 3, 2003 In 1991 Al Fassi was arrested in Jordan and hastily extradited to Saudi Arabia, where he was held without charges until his release to house arrest. His arrest stemmed from his having taken the side of Iraq in the Persian Gulf War. He made broadcasts from Baghdad denouncing Saudi Arabia for its participation in the war, for its human rights policies, and calling for democracy.Dennis McLellan,Article in LA Times, Dec 21, 2002 Al Fassi died Dec. 24, 2002 in Cairo. According to Marvin Mitchelson, the divorce lawyer for his first wife, Sheika Dena al Fassi, he died of an infected hernia, and was survived by four grown children.

The play is a courtroom drama, suspense, and psychological drama ‚Äî and explores sexual abuse issues, family and social power dynamics, and aspects of the criminal court system. It was adapted into a film of the same name in 1987, starring Barbra Streisand and Richard Dreyfuss. Plot When strong-willed, high-class call girl Claudia Draper is indicted for manslaughter in the first degree after killing a client in self- defense, her mother Rose and stepfather Arthur attempt to have her declared mentally incompetent, which would prevent a trial and cause Claudia to be institutionalized. Public defender Aaron Levinsky is assigned to her case, but Claudia is angry and distrustful of everybody, and she resists his help, disrupting both her examinations by psychiatrist Herbert Rosenthal and her court hearings. As findings progress, new insights into Claudia's entire life experience, including sexual abuse by her stepfather, begin to surface. Background Nuts takes place in the courtroom in the psychiatric wing of Bellevue Hospital in New York City. Tom Torpor used his years of experience as a journalist covering New York City police stations, courtrooms, hospitals, and psychiatric wards in crafting the play.Nickens, Christopher and Karen Swenson. The Films of Barbra Streisand. Citadel Press, 2001. , p. 174. He derived the mental illness plot from a true-life incident he had reported in the early 1970s, and he also questioned his wife about her incestuous childhood, which provided the lead character's motivation to become a prostitute.Kimbrell, James. Barbra: An Actress Who Sings. Boston: Branden Publishing Company, 1989. , pp. 9-17. Production Nuts was produced in an early draft form at the Off-Off Broadway WPA Theater in 1979. Universal Studios purchased the film rights and financed the play's move to Broadway. Following eight previews, it opened at the Biltmore Theatre on April 28, 1980, where it ran for 96 performances and closed on July 20. Directed by Stephen Zuckerman, who had directed the original production, it starred Anne Twomey as Claudia, Richard Zobel as Aaron Levinsky, Hansford Rowe as Arthur Kirk, Lenka Peterson as Rose Kirk, Paul Stolarsky as Dr. Rosenthal, and Ed Van Nuys as Judge Murdoch. Anne Twomey won the Theatre World Award and was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play, and Hansford Rowe was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Play. Film adaptation Tom Topor, Darryl Ponicsan, and Alvin Sargent adapted the play for the 1987 film of the same title, directed by Martin Ritt and starring Barbra Streisand and Richard Dreyfuss.

The film is based on the true story of Cindy Fralick, the first female firefighter of the Los Angeles County Fire Department.Review summary The New York Times  Plot  Situated in the early 1980s, the plot focuses on Cindy Fralick, a parking enforcement officer who is uninspired by her job. One day, she witnesses the injuries of an accident and decides she wants to help people. She considers applying at the fire department, but feels discouraged because there are no female firefighters in Los Angeles. She passes the written exams, but the people at the oral exams have no confidence she will be strong enough to pass the physical tests. When her husband suddenly files for divorce, she initially changes her mind about her career ambitions, until her best friend Sharon encourages her not to give up. The fire department staff doesn't take her training seriously, but she proves to be one of the best during physical tests. Cindy soon becomes the talk of the town, earning the respect of all her co-trainees. After the training, she becomes the first woman in sixty years to pass the tests. She enters the Academy, but is required to cut her hair short. She is treated horribly and considers dropping out. Her Chief encourages her to allow herself to get used to the military treatment, assuring her it will only take nine weeks. After finally becoming an official firefighter, she gets a lot of media attention. This upsets her because all she wanted was a job, not to be anyone's hero. Her colleagues are initially annoyed by her, because they feel they can't be themselves in the presence of a woman. However, she is soon one of the guys and wins the heart of fellow firefighter Mike. On her first real job, she wins the respect of her bosses by not showing any fear of the fire. She starts going out with Mike, but he soon irritates her. She thinks it's because he isn't romantic enough, but Cindy feels that it's too soon after the divorce for her to be involved with someone. Meanwhile, she decides to become a paramedic, but still has to deal with prejudice. In the end, she saves a heroin addict who overdoses. She decides not to end her relationship with Mike.

With English help, he ruled parts of the kingdom from 1332 to 1356. Life Seal of Edward Balliol, King of Scotland He was the eldest son of John Balliol, erstwhile King of Scots, and Isabella de Warenne, daughter of John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey, and Alice de Lusignan. Alice was daughter of Hugh X de Lusignan and Isabella of Angoul√™me, widow of John, King of England. The death of King Robert I weakened Scotland considerably, since his son and successor David II was still a child and the two most able lieutenants, the Black Douglas and Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray, both died shortly afterwards. Taking advantage of this, Edward Balliol, backed by Edward III of England, defeated the Regent, the Earl of Mar, at the Battle of Dupplin Moor in Perthshire. He was crowned at Scone in September 1332, but three months later he was forced to flee half-naked back to England, following a surprise attack by nobles loyal to David II at the Battle of Annan. On his retreat from Scotland, Balliol sought refuge with the Clifford family, land owners in Westmorland, and stayed in their castles at Appleby, Brougham, Brough, and Pendragon. He was back put into power by the English in 1333, following the siege of Berwick and the Battle of Halidon Hill. Balliol then ceded the whole of the district formerly known as Lothian to Edward and paid homage to him as liege lord while staying in Black friars church in Newcastle upon Tyne [Church of St Nicholas, John McQuillen ISBN 32044081224222]. With no serious support in Scotland, he was defeated again in 1334, fleeing Scotland once more. In November 1334, Edward III invaded again, but unable to bring the Scots to battle, he retreated in February 1335. He and Edward Balliol returned again in July 1336 with a large English army and advanced through Scotland, first to Glasgow and then to Perth, Edward III destroying the surrounding countryside as they went. By late 1336, the Scots had regained control over virtually all of Scotland and by 1338 the tide had turned against the usurper. The final blow was the English defeat on 30 November 1335 at the Battle of Culblean which was the effective end of Balliol's attempt to overthrow the King of Scots. He returned to Scotland after the defeat of David II at Battle of Neville's Cross in 1346 and with a small force raised an insurrection in Galloway in a final attempt to gain the crown of Scotland. He only succeeded in gaining control of some of Galloway, with his power diminishing there until 1355. On 20 January 1356, Balliol surrendered his claim to the Scottish throne to Edward III in exchange for an English pension. He spent the rest of his life living in obscurity. He died childless in 1367, at Wheatley, Doncaster, Yorkshire, England. The location of his grave is believed to be under a Doncaster Post Office.

He introduced Renaissance architecture to France with the assistance of Pierre Lescot, Philibert Delorme and Jean Bullant. Though he was referred to by contemporaries as architecte and was even appointed architecte du roi, he is remembered especially for his suites of engravings produced from 1549 (beginning with a suite of Triumphal arches) from his printshop in Orl√©ans. Androuet was born in Paris, but worked in Orl√©ans until 1559, when he returned to Paris, where he produced his notable Livre d'architecture (dedicated to Henri II). In 1569, under the pressures of the French Wars of Religion, Jacques I Androuet du Cerceau fled to the Huguenot stronghold of Montargis, the seat of Ren√©e de France, duchess of Ferrara, daughter of Louis XII; the ch√¢teau featured strongly in his best-known work, the folio volumes of Les plus excellents bastiments de France (1576, second volume 1579). He died in Annecy. Engraved design for a cabinet, by Jacques I Androuet du Cerceau, ca. 1550s: such a cabinet would have been executed in contrasting walnut and ebony, its top a low plinth for sculpture or a display of silver His fine engravings of French ch√¢teaux and the perspective views of their gardens‚Äî which he documented but did not design‚Äî and his extravagantly fanciful suites of engravings of decorative architectural elements and furniture, heavily loaded with sculptural ornament, were especially influential for the designers and luxury craftsmen of Antwerp, working in the style broadly called Northern Mannerism. In the 1570s he was back in Paris, working for Charles IX and Catherine de' Medici. Though documentation is lacking, and attribution to the author of a widely used patternbook is generally risky, he is credited with the designs of the ch√¢teaux of Verneuil, in Verneuil-en-Halatte, which was later purchased by Henri IV in 1600, and Charles IX's ch√¢teau of Charleval (demolished), where he was assisted by his son Baptiste. The nickname \\"Cerceau\\" comes from the emblem of a ring that appears in lieu of a signature on engravings by Jacques Androuet. Answering the pressure of demand for authentic \\"Henri II\\" furniture designs in the 1880s, suites of designs by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau for chimneypieces, furniture and arabesque ornament were reproduced by the new technique of heliogravure.Baldus 1884. In the years after 1906, the detailed bird's-eye-view perspective engravings of Jacques Androuet enabled the patterned parterres of the Ch√¢teau de Villandry to be restored to their 16th-century appearance.

He became a royal architect during the reign of Henry III. In 1594, during the reign of Henry IV, Louis M√©tezeau was also appointed royal architect, a designation opposed by Androuet du Cerceau on the grounds that only one architect could hold the position at any given time. Androuet du Cerceau's claims were rejected in 1599, when the crown asserted its right to name as many royal architects as it wished.Ballon 1991, p. 39. It is considered unlikely that the two architects collaborated during their dispute. Androuet du Cerceau is traditionally credited with the design of the western section of the Louvre's Grande Galerie (1595-1610), which extended along the right bank of the Seine as part of Henry IV's grand project to link the Louvre to the Tuileries Palace, while the eastern section, in a very different style, is traditionally credited to Louis M√©tezeau. The project was abruptly halted after the assassination of the king in 1610, but the Grande Galerie and the Gros Pavilion des Tuileries (begun in 1595, now known as the Pavillon de Flore), that formed the junction between the Grande Galerie and the south end of the Tuileries, were completed, but in the 1860s Androuet du Cerceau's work was entirely demolished and rebuilt in a different design by the Louvre's architect Hector Lefuel.Ballon 1991, pp. 55‚Äì56.

The 2009 Turks and Caicos Islands migrant shipwreck was the loss of a motorless boat carrying Haitian migrants near the British Turks and Caicos Islands in the northern West Indies, late on the night of 26 July 2009. Sixty-five persons went missing; earlier figures of 79 missing migrants were reduced as bodies were recovered. After 2 days at least fifteen corpses had been located. The boat had spent three days at sea before it capsized. One survivor said the craft ended up on a reef while attempting to escape a patrolling police vessel. A Turks and Caicos police sergeant confirmed that the boat hit Molasses Reef near West Caicos. Of the 124 people who were rescued, 102 were male; 22 were female. Several severely injured migrants were helicoptered to a hospital in Providenciales. Many were brought ashore aboard small boats, whilst five migrants were located alive and well after seemingly having swum to safety. The incident was reported to the United States Coast Guard by authorities from Turks and Caicos. A spokesperson for the Coast Guard said they rescued 113 migrants and were assisting in the search for those who were still missing. He said they were \\"hopeful\\" of finding more missing migrants alive but that \\"it has been a night and we have not located any additional people\\". A helicopter and a cutter were also sent by the United States. An investigation was started to determine the cause. The boat had no motor. Hubert Hughes, Turks and Caicos Deputy Police Commissioner, claimed police had not been chasing the boat and only assisted when it became apparent that it had gotten into trouble. Haitians were immediately repatriated. The incident followed the interception of 124 Haitian migrants from what was described as a \\"grossly overloaded\\" boat travelling southwest of this shipwreck.

The term is also used among Protestants to refer to different denominations of the same religious tradition.  Use in the 12th century The expression, allegedly in use among the Orthodox since the fifth century among the \\"patriarchal sister Churches\\", appeared in written form in two letters of the Metropolitan Nicetas of Nicomedia (1136) and the Patriarch John Camaterus (in office from 1198 to 1206), in which they protested that Rome, by presenting herself as mother and teacher, would annul their authority. In their view, Rome was only the first among sister churches of equal dignity, see first among equals. According to this idea of Pentarchy, there are five Patriarchs at the head of the Church, with the Church of Rome having the first place of honor among these patriarchal sister churches. According to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, however, no Roman pontiff ever recognised this Orthodox equalization of the sees or accepted that only a primacy of honor be accorded to the See of Rome. Second Vatican Council In modern times, the expression \\"sister Churches\\" first appeared in John XXIII's letters to the Orthodox Patriarch of Constantinople, Athenagoras I. In his letters, the pope expressed the hope of seeing the unity between the sister churches re-established in the near future. Later the term appeared in a \\"Joint Declaration\\" between Pope Paul VI and Patriarch Athenagoras in 1965, representing their respective sees, Rome and Constantinople, respectively. The Second Vatican Council adopted the expression \\"sister Churches\\" to describe the relationship between particular Churches: \\"in the East there flourish many particular local Churches; among them the patriarchal Churches hold first place, and of these, many glory in taking their origins from the apostles themselves. Therefore, there prevailed and still prevails among Eastern Christians an eager desire to perpetuate in a communion of faith and charity those family ties which ought to exist between local Churches, as between sisters.\\" The first papal document in which the term \\"sister churches\\" is applied to the Churches is the apostolic brief, \\"Anno ineunte,\\" of Paul VI to the Patriarch Athenagoras I. After having indicated his willingness to do everything possible to \\"re-establish full communion between the Church of the West and that of the East\\", the Pope asked: \\"Since this mystery of divine love is at work in every local Church, is not this the reason for the traditional expression 'sister Churches', which the Churches of various places used for one another?\\" John Paul II Recently, John Paul II often used the term, especially in three principal documents: # The encyclical Slavorum Apostoli, in which he states the following: \\"For us they [Cyril and Methodius] are the champions and also the patrons of the ecumenical endeavour of the sister Churches of East and West, for the rediscovery through prayer and dialogue of visible unity in perfect and total communion\\"; # In a letter (dated 1999) to the bishops of Europe: \\"Hence, with these Churches [the Orthodox Churches] the relations are to be fostered as between sister Churches, to use the expression of Pope Paul VI in his brief to the Patriarch of Constantinople, Athenagoras I\\";http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/letters/1999/documents/hf_jp- ii_let_19910531_relationships-catholics-orthodox.html and # In the encyclical Ut Unum Sint in which he says: \\"Following the Second Vatican Council and in the light of earlier tradition, it has again become usual to refer to the particular or local Churches gathered around their bishop as 'sister Churches'. In addition, the lifting of mutual excommunications, by eliminating a painful canonical and psychological obstacle, was a very significant step on the way toward full communion.\\" In number 60 of the encyclical, he states: \\"More recently, the joint international commission took a significant step forward with regard to the very sensitive question of the method to be followed in re-establishing full communion between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church, an issue which has frequently embittered relations between Catholics and Orthodox. The commission has laid the doctrinal foundations for a positive solution to this problem on the basis of the doctrine of sister Churches.\\" Ecclesiastical directives A 2000 document of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith gave the following directives on the use of the expression \\"sister churches\\":  Usage with regards to the Anglican communion  Pope Paul VI was a good friend of the Anglican Church, which he described as \\"our beloved sister Church\\" in ecumenical meetings with Anglican leaders. However, the use of this term to describe the Anglican Church, even unofficially, was later rejected by Pope John Paul II and Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger in the document Dominus Iesus,Responses to Some Questions Regarding Certain Aspects of the Doctrine on the Church because of lingering doubts regarding the validity of Anglican orders and the consequent apostolic succession of Anglican bishops and ministers, among other things.These \\"other things\\" were spelled out in an address Cardinal Walter Kasper, President of the Pontifical Council for the Promotion of Christian Unity, delivered to a conference of Anglican bishops at St.Albans, UK, in 2003 In a speech to Anglican bishops, Cardinal Walter Kasper noted that \\"a final solution [to recognition of Anglican orders] can be found only in the larger context of full communion in faith, sacramental life and shared apostolic vision.\\" He specifically mentioned obstacles like \\"lay presidency, the ordination of women, and ethical problems such as abortion and homosexual partnerships.\\" See Paul Handley, \\"Churches' goal is unity, not uniformity spokesman for Vatican declares,\\".Church Times, 27 May 2003, 2 This position seems to be in line with the posture of Orthodoxy towards Anglicanism. Kallistos Ware notes: \\"For Orthodoxy, the validity of ordinations does not depend simply on the fulfillment of certain technical conditions (external possession of the apostolic succession; correct form, matter and intention).See Timothy Ware, The Orthodox Church London: Penguin Books, 1993) 320 The Catholic Church seems to be of the same mind concerning broader and \\"more substantive\\" criteria (not merely \\"the fulfillment of technical conditions\\") necessary for recognition of Anglican orders. Even Pope Paul VI, given his openness to Anglicans, did not revoke Apostolicae curae, which declares Anglican orders to be \\"absolutely null and utterly void.\\" According to Rosemary Radford Ruether, it unhappily suggests that the \\"only ecumenism\\" that \\"counts\\" is \\"between Rome and Constantinople,\\" though Anglicans, a second millennium church, \\"yearn to get into the 'old boys' club' of patriarchs.\\"Rosemary Radford Ruether, \\"Uppity women and authentic ecumenism,\\" The Witness, April, 1989. In Protestantism Different denominations of the same religious tradition are often said to have \\"sister church\\" relationships, especially if they are in different countries. For example, a sister church relationship exists between the Free Reformed Churches of Australia, the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands (Liberated), the Canadian and American Reformed Churches and the Free Reformed Churches of South Africa. This relationship includes mutual recognition of the eligibility of ministers. The Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod has a policy of closed communion, which means the Eucharist ordinarily shared only with those who are baptized and confirmed members of one of the congregations of LCMS or of a congregation of one of her sister churches with whom she has formally declared altar and pulpit fellowship (i.e., agreement in all articles of doctrine). Most members of the International Lutheran Council are LCMS sister churches.

It lies to the east of East Cowes and is from the entrance to the River Medina. Its shoreline is in length and is gently curving. It stretches from Old Castle Point in the west to Barton Point to the east. It is named for the neighbouring Osborne House estate on the shore, which owns the land facing the bay. The bay has a beach, which is privately owned, is open to the public. It is around 300 yards long, and predominantly consists of shingle and sand. The seabed is a mixture of mud and sand, and is shallow up to around a of a nautical mile out. In the summer, the bay is popular for yacht anchorage, being sheltered from the prevailing south- westerly winds, and can become very crowded. History left In 1845 Osborne House was bought by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and became a popular retreat for them and the Royal Family to holiday. It was where her children learned to swim, and it the first place the Queen swam in the sea. As was popular at the time, she used an ornate Bathing machine to change and enter the water. After her death in 1901, the bathing machine was removed and the estate, including the bay, was gifted to the nation in 1902 by her successor, Edward VII. The Royal Naval College, Osborne was later established on the estate. The beach was used for troop training before the D-Day landings; during these exercises, severe damage was done to the pavilion and piers on the bay. The beach was first open to the public in summer 2012, and its owners, English Heritage, have a marine licence allowing there to be a marked swimming area for visitors.

It was established in April 1889, when the German Imperial Admiralty was abolished and its duties divided among three new entities: the Imperial Naval High Command (Kaiserliches Oberkommando der Marine), the Imperial Naval Cabinet (Kaiserliches Marinekabinett) and the Imperial Naval Office performing the functions of a ministry for the Imperial German Navy. Structure and tasks Admiral Tirpitz used the office for promotion of his ambitious naval expansion plans According to the 1871 Constitution of the German Empire, the federal states were responsible for the German land forces and the imperial government for the navy. So while there were Prussian, Bavarian, Saxon and W√ºrttemberg armies, there was a single Imperial Navy, the only formation under the direct authority of the German Reich beside the colonial Schutztruppe forces. The head of the Naval Office was a Secretary of State who reported directly to the Imperial Chancellor (Reichskanzler). While the operational management of the Navy was the responsibility of the Imperial Naval High Command and under the direct command of Emperor Wilhelm II from 1899, the tasks of the Office were mainly administrative, such as planning naval construction and maintenance programs, directing the procurement of naval supplies, and advising the Reichstag parliament on naval matters.Gottschall, Terrell D. By order of the Kaiser: Otto von Diederichs and the rise of the Imperial German Navy, 1865-1902 ( Institute Press, 2003) p.112. It also ran the Imperial shipyards in Danzig, Kiel and Wilhelmshaven, several educational institutions, and the Seewarte meteorological institute in Hamburg. History Bendlerblock office building When in 1897 Konteradmiral Alfred von Tirpitz succeeded State Secretary Friedrich von Hollmann, who had resigned in a dispute on the naval budget, he made the Naval Office the power base in his campaign to build a great German High Seas Fleet to encounter Britain's Royal Navy. According to the theories of US admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan and his book The Influence of Sea Power upon History, the \\"Tirpitz Plan\\" was established jointly with Foreign State Secretary Bernhard von B√ºlow and, in interaction with the British Naval Defence Act 1889, fuelled the Anglo-German naval arms race. Tirpitz had urged for the dissolution of the Imperial Naval High Command in 1899, which gave him even more power but proved as fatal in World War I. In 1898, the Naval Office also took over the administration of the Chinese Kiautschou Bay territory. During World War I, it gave out the casualty list of the Imperial Navy. State Secretary Tirpitz finally resigned in 1916, when Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg strove for a balance with the British and Tirpitz' requests for full powers as fleet commander modelled on a First Sea Lord were denied. After the war, the Imperial Naval Office was disestablished on 15 July 1919, when by decree of Reich President Friedrich Ebert its responsibilities were assigned to the Admiralty Staff, which was transformed into the Marineleitung agency of the German Reichswehr Ministry in 1920.

Mesa and Garcia sold the southern half of their rancho to Colonel Jonathan D. Stevenson in 1849, and the northern half to James Walsh, Michael Murray, and Ellen Fallon in 1850. There was confusion about the orientation of the grant, and in 1851 Stevenson arranged an exchange of deeds, whereby he got the west half of the rancho, and Walsh, Murray, and Fallon got the east half.James Walsh v J.P.

Stevenson and others laid out a site for a town they called \\"New York of the Pacific\\", and Rancho Los Medanos is sometimes known as the \\"New York Ranch\\". The name of the settlement was changed to Pittsburg in 1911. Stevenson sold the rancho to the San Francisco banking firm of Louis Pioche, who in turn sold it in 1872 to L. L. Robinson.

It was released on December 16, 2009 by Ariola Japan, marking Misia's first album release under the label. The album yielded seven singles, \\"Yes Forever\\" and \\"Yakusoku no Tsubasa\\", released in 2008, the digital exclusive \\"Sukoshi Zutsu Taisetsu ni\\", the double A-side single \\"Ginga\\" / \\"Itsumademo\\", \\"Aitakute Ima\\", and lastly \\"Hoshi no Y≈ç ni...\\", released on the same day as the album. Just Ballade was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. Background and release Fresh off The Tour of Misia Discotheque Asia, where the musical emphasis was on lively, uptempo dance music, Misia wanted a change of pace with the next album. She was inspired by the positive feedback she received from concert audiences in relation to the ballad section of her Discotheque Asia setlist, and set out to make an album that could recreate the same \\"well-filled quiet\\" that garnered such a favorable reception. As the title of the album suggests, Just Ballade consists predominantly of ballads, however not all tracks on the record are slow-tempo songs. In an interview with Excite, Misia explained the varied tempo and sound of the album by stating that, while people might have a general preconception of what a ballad will sound like, it's not as clear cut. She remarks that, to her, what makes a song a ballad isn't the piano or the orchestra, but whether the song can move her to tears. Just Ballade is Misia's first studio album in close two years, since Eighth World. It was issued in Blu-spec CD format and released in three different versions, a standard CD- only edition, and two limited editions. Limited edition \\"A\\" comes packaged in a CD sleeve with a different cover art and includes a DVD featuring six music videos, while limited edition \\"B\\" is packaged in a pop-up case, also with an alternate cover art, housed in a clear sleeve and comes with a 28-page color booklet. In addition to the singles, several album tracks were also used in promotional campaigns leading up to their release. \\"Chiheisen no Muk≈çgawa e\\" served as ending theme to the TX news program World Business Satellite, \\"Boku no Kimochi\\" as ending theme to the AX variety show Himitsu no Kenmin Show, and \\"Work It Out\\" as ending theme to the AX news program J≈çh≈ç Live Miyaneya. Critical reception CDJournal critics remarked that the listener should not take the title of the album too literally, as the album includes many styles of ballads. They noted that the sound on the record is \\"perfected to the last detail\\". Misia was praised for her powerful vocal performance, with critics describing it as \\"transportive\\". Adam Greenberg of AllMusic, pronounced Misia's voice to be the \\"star of the show\\", but also noted that she can sometimes go overboard and overpower the sensibility of the ballad. Writing for Bounce, Aokinoko described Just Ballade as a \\"love song collection\\" basking in the \\"essence of many different styles.\\" Aokinoko praised the record as \\"stimulating\\", singled out \\"Aitakute Ima\\", \\"Ginga\\" and \\"Call Me Love Me\\" as the standout tracks, and called it the \\"perfect lovers' soundtrack\\". Commercial performance Just Ballade entered the daily Oricon Albums Chart at number 3, selling 18,000 copies on its first day. It slid to number 4 the following day, where it stayed for the rest of the week. The album debuted at number 4 on the weekly Oricon Albums Chart, selling 57,000 copies. It also debuted at number 4 on the Billboard Japan Top Albums Sales chart. The album fell to number 8 on its second week on the Oricon chart, logging sales of 33,000 copies. Just Ballade charted for twenty-one non-consecutive weeks on the Oricon Albums Chart, selling a reported total of 143,000 copies during its run.

Proft (born April 29, 1972) is an attorney, political advocate, former Republican candidate for Illinois governor, and radio talk show host with AM 560 The Answer (WIND) in Chicago where he co-hosts the morning drive show. He voices a political commentary, \\"Sixty Seconds of Sanity\\" on the Salem Radio Network. He is also the president of Local Government Information Systems, an entity controlling sites like Kendall County Times and Will County Gazette. Early life and education Proft was born in 1972 in Oak Park, Illinois. He was raised in Wheaton, Illinois, and attended Benet Academy in Lisle. He graduated from Northwestern University with a B.A. and attended Loyola University Chicago School of Law at night and earned Juris Doctor degree. At Northwestern, Proft co-founded the Northwestern Chronicle, an independent campus newspaper. He also ran a conservative speakers bureau. Professional life= Media = Proft is a radio talk show host with AM 560 The Answer in Chicago where he co-hosts the morning drive show with Amy Jacobson. He voices a political commentary, \\"Sixty Seconds of Sanity\\" on the Salem Radio Network. Dan Proft co-hosts the morning drive show from 5 to 9 a.m. Monday through Friday on AM 560 The Answer in Chicago. Recent guests in 2018 on \\"Chicago‚Äôs Morning Answer\\" (AM-560) were Joe Trippi, the former campaign manager for Howard Dean, and Alan Dershowitz, a professor at Harvard Law School. From 2011 to 2015, Proft was a political commentator for WLS-AM 890 radio in Chicago. From 2014-2015, he shared a weekday show from 5 to 9 a.m. with Bruce Wolf. After his contract expired, he moved to AM 560 WIND. He has also appeared on Chicago television including ABC 7 Chicago and Fox Chicago and his commentary has been featured on national outlets including Fox News Channel, MSNBC, and CNBC. Additionally, Proft runs Upstream Ideas, a media group that runs a series of web and radio-based programs where Proft discusses regional and national politics and policy. On August 8, 2018, Proft interviewed former White House Communication Director and Press Secretary Sean Spicer about his \\"tempestuous time in President Trump‚Äôs White House.\\" The interview was filmed for Proft's interview series Against the Current on the digital platform Upstream Ideas. = Politics and policy = Proft is a co- founder of the Illinois Opportunity Project, a 501(c)(4) organization that promotes free-market public policy solutions. According to a 2008 Chicago Tribune article criticizing Proft, after helping Cicero's town president win a close election, Proft received no-bid contracts worth $578,000 a year to serve as the spokesman for the town and two local school districts. The town also agreed to pay the company another $308,000 a year to promote the new Municipal Complex. Cicero spent nearly double what even much larger suburban communities spend on public relations. Proft serves as the Chairman and Treasurer for Illinois Liberty Principles PAC, an independent expenditure, Super PAC organized \\"to make independent expenditures in support of liberty oriented policies and candidates.\\" The PAC received criticism after it sent political mailings in newspaper form to voters ahead of the 2016 primary elections, publishing eight separate periodic mailings. Illinois's State Board of Elections rejected claims against Liberty PAC for alleged violations of campaign finance law. He is also on the board of Truth in Accounting, a nonprofit dedicated to accurate public sector accounting and budgeting. Prior to his campaign for Governor, Proft was a Republican consultant working on numerous political campaigns and served in various leadership capacities in state and municipal government. Proft has faced criticism for emails he sent to Tea Party groups in Illinois. On July 11, 2016, the Chicago Tribune published an op-ed written by Proft concerning the 2016 shooting of Dallas police officers. In the article, he criticized the media's coverage of both the Dallas shootings and the shootings of black men by police officers. He wrote that \\"There is plenty of intellectual room between 'cops can do no wrong' and 'cops are all racists waging war against minorities.' The reasoned room in between is occupied by most of the Americans who are not on television, radio or Twitter.\\" Proft supported the candidacy of Jeanne Ives in her primary campaign against incumbent Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner. At a campaign appearance in January 2018, Ives thanked Proft and said, \\"By far, Dan is one of the most engaging radio host, providing a daily dose of morning entertainment.\\" In February 2018, Ives ran a controversial TV ad called \\"Thank you, Bruce Rauner\\" that \\"created a firestorm in the March Republican Primary for governor.\\" In the ad, she attacked Governor Bruce Rauner over his policy decisions on abortion, transgender rights, and immigration. Proft defended the TV ad, saying, \\"Not everybody's tone or sensibility is the same, so people are going to take things differently. But in terms of the veracity of the statements in the ad and the representations, the characterizations of issues and issue positions the governor has taken, that's all factual.\\" Proft also serves on the board of directors for USO of Illinois, a nonprofit that provides assistance to Illinois military families; Envision Unlimited, a nonprofit in Chicago that serves developmentally disabled persons; and Aid for Women, a Catholic pregnancy center in Chicago. He is also on the Advisory Board of the Center for Civic Leadership at Benedictine University; 2010 Illinois gubernatorial campaign On June 23, 2009, Proft announced his candidacy for Governor of Illinois on the \\"Don Wade & Roma Show\\" on WLS (AM). The tagline of Proft's campaign was \\"Illinois isn't broken. It's fixed,\\" signifying Illinois' government is set up to serve the politicians in power, not the people. He called for \\"policy revolution\\" to slice state personal and corporate income taxes in half and abolish the estate tax, to freeze spending and only allow it to increase based on inflation and population growth, and to implement a statewide opportunity scholarship program. Proft earned 7.78% of the vote, coming in sixth in a seven-way Republican primary race. He later told Chicago Magazine that the worst part of running for office was raising money. He self-financed his campaign for $125,285.  Personal life  Proft is a practicing Catholic and lives in the Streeterville neighborhood of Chicago.

The winner of an Oscar at the 9th Academy Awards for Best Animated Short Film, the film was produced by Walt Disney, directed by Wilfred Jackson, and animated by Art Babbitt and Les Clark. As is true for most cartoons in the Silly Symphonies series, The Country Cousin was built around a musical score, which was written by Leigh Harline. The film's story was based on one of Aesop's Fables, The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse. It was accompanied by a storybook for young children, which was common for many of the Silly Symphonies. Plot The Country Cousin tells the story of a mouse from \\"Podunk\\" (an American English name denoting a place \\"in the middle of nowhere\\") coming to visit his relative in the city. The opening shot/title card is of the mouse in question, Abner, staring up at the city skyscrapers, with the sign directing him to Podunk facing the opposite way. He receives a telegram (titled a \\"Mouse-O-Gram\\") from his cousin, Monty, telling him to \\"Stop being a hick\\" and come live with him in the city. Without specifying the location of Abner or Monty, the film sets out to contrast the lifestyles of the archetypal country and city inhabitants. Abner is shown walking along a railroad towards the city, and when he arrives, the differences between the two become clear. Abner is wearing overalls and is portrayed as bumbling and oblivious to the dangers of the city, whilst Monty sports a top-hat and is acutely aware of the problems they face (as exemplified whenever he tells Abner to shush, which is also the only sign of dialogue here). Monty leads Abner to a meal that the human residents of the household have set out. The two mice begin by dining on cheese, but Abner lacks any sense of etiquette, and soon begins gorging himself on celery, cream, and mustard, the latter of which generates a reaction to the excessive heat. Cooling himself with Champagne, Abner finds himself partial to the taste, and becomes drunk, provoking the disdain of Monty. Abner begins seeing in double vision, and creates more noise by bringing down a pile of bread (causing the double visions of Monty to hide behind the real one). Abner then assesses his reflection (which, in his intoxicated state, he thinks is someone else) in a block of jelly . As he walks away, he slips on a piece of butter lying on a saucer. The saucer, spinning and flying across the table, catches Monty on the way, and breaks several pieces of dishware too. Monty is infuriated, and as the pair are now on the floor, he attempts to find a secluded spot, safe from the sleeping pet cat. The inebriated Abner, with a great sense of bravado, kicks the cat's behind, whilst his cousin rushes back to his home (and is never seen again from that point onwards). The cat bares its teeth at Abner, which only leads him to inspect the inside of its mouth, thus bringing Abner back to his senses. He is then chased by the cat, first receiving an electric shock by jumping inside a socket (the cat receives a shock as well), and then ending up on the city street when he jumps out of the window. Abner is faced with escaping from the footsteps of the people, a bike, an electric tram, and other vehicles. He finds himself at the city limits again, and flees back to his home town deciding that the city life just isn't for him. LP version In the early 1960s, Disneyland Records released an LP version of the story, narrated by Sterling Holloway, with music by Camarata. Because the running time of the LP was about thirty minutes, more than twice the length of the original cartoon's running time, much additional material was added to the plotline of the story. On the LP cover, the story was humorously billed as being after Aesop - way after. Also, the mice on the cover are patterned after the mice from the 1950 Disney film Cinderella, with Lucifer as the cat.https://www.amazon.com/Story-Of-The-Country-Cousins/dp/B004JJM0XI Home media The short was released on the 2001 Walt Disney Treasures DVD box set Silly Symphonies.

After achieving her goal of statewide women's suffrage, she went on to become a member of the Arizona Senate more than five years before ratification of the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution granted the vote to all American women. Early life Munds was born Frances Lillian Willard in Franklin, California, on June 10, 1866, the eighth child of Joel and Mary Grace Vinyard Willard and a granddaughter of Alexander Hamilton Willard. Her family were ranchers who moved to Nevada before moving on to the Arizona Territory. Willard was educated at the Central Institute in Pittsfield, Maine, graduating in 1885. After graduation, Willard joined her family in the Arizona Territory, where her four brothers operated a ranch in the Verde Valley with her father's former business partner, William Munds (Joel Willard had died in 1879). She worked as a school teacher in the communities of Pine, Payson, and Mayer before marrying John Lee Munds, youngest son of Willard Munds, in 1890. The couple moved to Prescott in 1893 where John Munds was elected Yavapai County sheriff for two terms beginning in 1899. The couple had one son and two daughters. Suffrage efforts In 1898, Munds was elected secretary for the Territory of Arizona Women Suffrage Organization. Together with organization president Pauline O'Neill, she reached out to Mormon women within the territory. This marked a change from the practices of earlier suffrage leaders, such as Josephine Brawley Hughes, who had shunned the Mormon community. This outreach enabled the organization to lobby Mormon members of the territorial legislature to support legislation supporting women. Munds also attended legislative sessions personally to lobby for women's issues. After several years' effort, the 1903 territorial legislature passed a bill granting women the vote. This legislation was later vetoed by Territorial Governor Alexander Brodie. A similar bill would later be vetoed by Governor Kibbey. In 1909, with statehood appearing imminent, Munds struck a deal with the Western Federation of Miners in which the labor union would support women's suffrage in exchange for the women's organization's support in labor issues. The next year, during Arizona's constitutional convention, a proposal granting women's suffrage was introduced. The proposed plank was defeated before it could be added to the constitution. Following Arizona's admission to the Union on February 14, 1912, a meeting of the State of Arizona Women Suffrage Organization unanimously elected Munds the organization's president. She initially refused to accept the position, but acquiesced on the condition the position be renamed chairman, and that she be allowed to reorganize the state organization. During the summer of 1912, Munds helped organize a petition drive to collect the 3,342 signatures needed for a ballot initiative. After gathering the needed signatures, Munds then proceeded to get the support of 95% of the state's labor unions. When the Progressive party came out in favor of the suffrage issue, Munds was able to force the Democratic and Republican parties to reevaluate their positions by threatening to throw support from women to the third party. When the election results were counted, the suffrage initiative had passed by a three-to-one margin in every county. Political career In 1913, Governor George Hunt appointed Munds to represent Arizona at the International Woman Suffrage Alliance in Budapest, Hungary. The next year, she, along with Rachel Berry of Apache County, became the first women elected to the Arizona Legislature (representing Yavapai County). Upon her entry to the state legislature in 1915, Munds said, \\"true blue conservatives will be shocked to think of a grandmother sitting in the State Senate.\\" During her time in office, she chaired the Committee on Education and Public Institutions, and also served on the Land Committee. Sen. Munds also introduced legislation doubling the widow's tax exemption. She chose not to run for a second term in the legislature, but in 1918 was persuaded to run for Secretary of State, a run which was unsuccessful. After leaving office, Munds remained active in politics for the rest of her life. She died at home on December 16, 1948, and was buried at the Mountain View cemetery in Prescott, Arizona. In 1982, she was inducted into the Arizona Women's Hall of Fame.

The system formed on June 7, 1997, about 460 kilometers (285 mi) to the north of Tokelau. The depression gradually developed over the next few days while moving southwestward. It was designated as Tropical Cyclone Keli early the next day. Cyclone Keli intensified, slowly reaching its 10-minute peak wind speeds of 150 km/h, (90 mph), which made it a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale. As it came under the influence of strong mid latitude westerlies and moved into an area of strong vertical wind shear, the cyclone started to weaken and was declared as extratropical on June 15. Cyclone Keli struck the islands of Tuvalu on June 12 and 13, with extensive damage reported throughout the Islands with trees uprooted by wind and waves. On Nivalakita, all buildings except for the church were flattened; an estimated cost to rebuild all of the houses as they were before the cyclone hit was estimated at A$ (US$), while it was estimated that the cost of rebuilding the houses with an improved, cyclone-resistant design would be about A$ (US$). The whole of Tepuka Savilivili was left uninhabitable, as coconut trees and other vegetation were swept away with no more than an area of jagged coral left behind. In Fiji, strong winds and rough seas were reported from the cyclone as it was moving to the north of Fiji, and while the cyclone was weakening it dropped 3.76 inches (95.5mm) of rain on American Samoa. Meteorological history Severe Tropical Cyclone Keli was first noted as a depression, to the northeast of the New Zealand territory of Tokelau during June 7, 1997. Over the next couple of days the system moved towards the south-west and gradually developed further, with the United States Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Center (NPMOC) issuing a tropical cyclone formation alert for the system during June 9. The NPMOC subsequently designated the system as Tropical Cyclone 38P and initiated advisories on the system early on June 10, while the system was located about to the east of Funafuti, Tuvalu. The system was subsequently named Keli by the Fiji Meteorological Service, after it had developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. During that day the system continued to move south-westwards, towards the island nation of Tuvalu and passed near or over the island of Niulakita during June 11. After it the system had passed over Niulakita, Keli rapidly intensified in an area of light vertical wind shear, as it moved slowly and performed a small cyclonic loop. Early on June 12, the FMS reported that Keli had peaked as a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, with 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 150 km/h (90 mph). During that day the system started to weaken and came to within of making a second landfall on Niulakita, before it accelerated south- eastwards as it interacted with the Westerlies. The NPMOC also reported during that day that Keli had peaked with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 215 km/h (130 mph), which made it equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir- Simpson hurricane wind scale. During June 13, the system continued to move south-eastwards and passed about to the southeast of Mata-Utu in the island nation of Wallis and Futuna. Later that day Keli started to transition into an extratropical cyclone, during the following day the system passed within of Apia, Samoa. During June 15, the FMS reported that Keli had weakened into a tropical depression, while the NPMOC reported that it had degenerated into an extratropical cyclone. The system was subsequently last noted during June 17, while it was located about to the southeast of Adamstown in the Pitcairn Islands. Impact and aftermath Heavy rain was reported in American Samoa with a rainfall total, of reported at Afono in American Samoa. The name Keli was retired after this usage of the name and was replaced with the name Kofi. =Tuvalu= Image of Keli at peak intensity on June 12, 1997 Keli was the third and final tropical cyclone to impact Tuvalu during the 1996‚Äì97 season, after Severe Tropical Cyclone's Gavin and Hina affected the island nation during March 1997. Ahead of the system impacting Tuvalu, storm and gale-force wind warnings were issued for the islands of Niulakita and Nukulaelae, while a strong wind warning was issued for the rest of the group during June 10. During that day the system moved south-westwards and passed near or over Niulakita later that day, before it performed a cyclonic loop and passed within of Niulakita during June 12. As Cyclone Keli struck the islands of Tuvalu on June 12 and 13, peak wind gusts of 165 km/h, (105 mph) were reported, with extensive damage also reported throughout the Islands with trees uprooted by wind and waves. On Nivalakita all buildings except for the church were flattened with an estimated cost to rebuild the houses exactly as they were was estimated at A$12,000 (US$10,000 1997), while it was estimated that the cost of rebuilding the houses with an improved, cyclone-resistant design would be about A$84,000 (US$63,000 1997). Also on Nivalakita communications were cut with the telephone operator having to resort to sending a Morse code message, however as the storm re-curved and re-hit Tuvalu on June 14, it silenced the weak radio telegraph system. In Tepuka Savilivili the whole island was left uninhabitable as coconut trees and other vegetation were swept away with no more than an area of jagged coral left behind. With effect from June 12, a state of public emergency was declared for the whole of Tuvalu, by the then Governor-General of Tuvalu, Sir Tulaga Manuella. This was because there was only a limited amount of food available on Funafuti to cater for the whole of the island nation, while providing Niulakita with immediate relief supplies. This enabled the Tuvaluan embassy in Suva, Fiji to appeal to various overseas countries and organisations including Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United Nations Development Programme to provide aid and assistance to the island nation. During June 14, the Royal New Zealand Air Force deployed a transport plane carrying some relief materials including tarpaulins and water from New Zealand. The plane subsequently stopped in Noumea, New Caledonia and Nadi, Fiji to pick up further relief supplies that had been donated by Australia, Fiji and France. The crew of the plane subsequently conducted an aerial assessment of the damage on Niulakita, and reported seeing widespread damage, before they arrived at Funafuti Airport during June 15. =Wallis and Futuna= Cyclone Keli was the third out of four tropical cyclones to impact the French Territory of Wallis and Futuna during a ten-month period, after Cyclones Gavin and Hina had affected the island during March 1997. There was almost no damage recorded in the archipeligo from Keli, while rainfall totals of and were recorded at Hihifo and Aka'aka on Wallis during June 11. Wind gusts of up to were recorded at Maopoopo on Futuna island during July 13. =Tonga= Keli was the second of three tropical cyclones to affect Tonga during a ten-month period, with Cyclones Hina and Ron affecting the island nation during March 1997 and January 1998. Ahead of the system impacting Tonga, the FMS issued cyclone warnings for the Niuas and strong wind warnings for the rest of Tonga. As a result of the warnings a vessel that was heading to the island group had to be recalled, which was predicted to affect supplies on the islands when it was likely to be most needed. During June 13, Keli caused some damage to the islands with plantations, breadfruit trees and other large trees devastated. The strong winds also destroyed several residences while causing damage to public buildings.

Otherwise, the Archbishop was certain that the remains of the Saint would have been subjected to desecration. After Lenin's stroke in 1922, Petrograd CPSU boss Grigory Zinoviev was determined to rid his district of organized Catholicism. With the support of a majority of the Politburo, a political show trial was arranged which was to be prosecuted by Deputy Commissar of Justice Nikolai Krylenko. The Cieplak Trial During the spring of 1923, Archbishop Cieplak, his Vicar General Monsignor Konstantin Budkevich, Byzantine Catholic Exarch Leonid Feodorov, fourteen other priests and one layman, were summoned to attend a trial in Moscow. According to Father Christopher Lawrence Zugger, > The Bolsheviks had already orchestrated several 'show trials.' The Cheka had > staged the 'Trial of the St. Petersburg Combat Organization'; its successor, > the new GPU, the 'Trial of the Socialist Revolutionaries.' In these and > other such farces, defendants were inevitably sentenced to death or to long > prison terms in the north. The Cieplak show trial is a prime example of > Bolshevik revolutionary justice at this time. Normal judicial procedures did > not restrict revolutionary tribunals at all; in fact, the prosecutor N.V. > Krylenko, stated that the courts could trample upon the rights of classes > other than the proletariat. Appeals from the courts went not to a higher > court, but to political committees. Western observers found the setting -- > the grand ballroom of a former Noblemen's Club, with painted cherubs on the > ceiling -- singularly inappropriate for such a solemn event. Neither judges > nor prosecutors were required to have a legal background, only a proper > 'revolutionary' one. That the prominent 'No Smoking' signs were ignored by > the judges themselves did not bode well for legalities.Father Christopher > Lawrence Zugger, \\"The Forgotten: Catholics in the Soviet Empire from Lenin > through Stalin,\\" University of Syracuse Press, 2001. Page 182. New York Herald correspondent Francis MacCullagh, who was present at the trial, later described its fourth day as follows: Archbishop Cieplak and Monsignor Budkevich were sentenced to the death penalty, all the other defendants received long sentences in the GULAG. The news of the sentences touched off enraged demonstrations throughout the Western world. According to Father Zugger, > The Vatican, Germany, Poland, Great Britain, and the United States undertook > frantic efforts to save the Archbishop and his chancellor. In Moscow, the > ministers from the Polish, British, Czechoslovak, and Italian missions > appealed 'on the grounds of humanity,' and Poland offered to exchange any > prisoner to save the archbishop and the monsignor. Finally, on March 29, the > Archbishop's sentence was commuted to ten years in prison, ... but the > Monsignor was not to be spared. Again, there were appeals from foreign > powers, from Western Socialists and Church leaders alike. These appeals were > for naught: Pravda editorialized on March 30 that the tribunal was defending > the rights of the workers, who had been oppressed by the bourgeois system > for centuries with the aid of priests. Pro-Communist foreigners who > intervened for the two men were also condemned as 'compromisers with the > priestly servants of the bourgeoisie.' ...Father Rutkowski recorded later > that Budkiewicz surrendered himself over to the will of God without > reservation. On Easter Sunday, the world was told that the Monsignor was > still alive, and Pope Pius XI publicly prayed at St. Peter's that the > Soviets would spare his life. Moscow officials told foreign ministers and > reporters that the Monsignor's sentence was just, and that the Soviet Union > was a sovereign nation that would accept no interference. In reply to an > appeal from the rabbis of New York City to spare Budkiewicz's life, Pravda > wrote a blistering editorial against 'Jewish bankers who rule the world' and > bluntly warned that the Soviets would kill Jewish opponents of the > Revolution as well. Only on April 4 did the truth finally emerge: the > Monsignor had already been in the grave for three days. When the news came > to Rome, Pope Pius fell to his knees and wept as he prayed for the priest's > soul. To make matters worse, Cardinal Gasparri had just finished reading a > note from the Soviets saying that 'everything was proceeding satisfactorily' > when he was handed the telegram announcing the execution. On 31 March 1923, > Holy Saturday, at 11:30 PM, after a week of fervent prayers and a firm > declaration that he was ready to be sacrificed for his sins, Monsignor > Constantine Budkiewicz had been taken from his cell and, sometime before the > dawn of Easter Sunday, shot in the back of the head on the steps of the > Lubyanka prison.Father Christopher Lawrence Zugger, \\"The Forgotten: > Catholics in the Soviet Empire from Lenin through Stalin,\\" University of > Syracuse Press, 2001. Pages 187-188 Release and later life Under international pressure, Cieplak was released from prison and taken to Poland in 1924. After reaching Poland, he left for Rome, and then to the United States, where he visited with Chicago's Polish Community at St. Hyacinth Basilica. On 10 November 1925 he arrived in Passaic, New Jersey. He died of an illness in DƒÖbrowa G√≥rnicza a few months later. In 1925 Archbishop Cieplak was nominated to serve as the Archbishop of Wilno (Vilnius) but he died before he was able to assume the position. He was interred in the Vilnius Cathedral. Legacy Since 1952 the Church is considering beatification of Archbishop Cieplak.

First developed in 2009, bioactive paper research has been ongoing and in 2011 was awarded a 5-year grant totalling $7.5 million CAD. It has been developed at the biosensor stage level, which means it can detect pesticides but is not yet able to repel and deactivate toxins. However, its ability to detect potential hazards has applications for human health and safety. The benefits of bioactive paper are that it is simple, portable, disposable, and inexpensive.  Development  Bioactive paper was developed by Canada‚Äôs Sentinel Bioactive Paper Network, a consortium of researchers, industrial and university, partners, and students. The Network is hosted by McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario and is led by Dr. Robert Pelton, scientific director and Dr. George Rosenberg, managing director. John Brennan and his research team at McMaster University developed the method to create bioactive paper by printing contaminant-detecting biosensors that are based on combinations of antibodies, enzymes, aptamers or bacteriophages, onto the structure of the paper. These combinations then attach themselves to pathogens and other contaminants resulting in a detectable response. The biologically active chemicals are in the form of an ‚Äòink‚Äô that can be printed, coated or impregnated onto or into paper using existing paper-making and high-speed printing processes. This ink is coated in different layers. The ink is similar to that found in a regular computer print cartridge, but it has special additives that make it biocompatible. It is made up of biocompatible silica nanoparticles that are deposited onto the paper first, then another ink containing the enzyme is applied. The bio-ink result forms a thin film of enzyme that is trapped in the silica on the paper. When the paper is exposed to a toxin, molecules in the ink change colour based on the amount of toxins in the sample. While bioactive paper is not available to the public yet, it is getting closer to commercialization. Bioactive paper also has a good shelf life. Researchers said the strip could still be used effectively for at least two months when stored properly.  Applications  One current application of bioactive paper can be applied to bioterrorism and food safety, as it can detect acetylcholinesterase, or a nerve agent. With this advancement, bioactive paper has become a product of interest for the military and the packaging industry. While efforts are underway to develop more applications of bioactive paper, there are currently four major areas of bioactive paper usage and research: paper-based bioassay or paper-based analytical devices for sample conditioning;pathogen detection for food and water quality monitoring; counterfeiting and countertempering in the packaging and construction industries; and deactivation of pathogenic bacteria using antimicrobial paper. = Food-borne illness = Approximately 76-million food-borne illnesses occur each in the United States, accounting for more than 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths [Mead et al., 1999]. Most of these illnesses are caused by Campylobacter, Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes. As a result, annual medical expenditures related to these pathogens currently exceed $7 billion US. Consumer education coupled with reliable and simple pathogen detection in food products offers the best method for dramatically reducing the frequency of occurrence of these illnesses. The most recent development involved being able to detect pesticides on food even after they‚Äôve been washed. This innovation is a benefit to developing countries that may use banned pesticides on their food because they‚Äôre cheaper. = Water contamination = In the developing world, the water is often of questionable quality, forcing the local population to try rudimentary filtration systems, such as the use of unsanitary cloth in a vain attempt to create potable water. This method is obviously not reliable and the results are rarely safe for consumption, particularly after floods and other natural disasters. Think of the benefits of a bioactive paper strip which, when dipped in small containers of water, can remove pathogens and give the user a colour indication that the water is safe to use. = Health care = Another potential use of bioactive paper includes the creation of face masks that protect health care workers by actively binding viruses and anchoring them to the filter surface which would prevent them from passing through the filter‚Äôs pores. = Packaging = Because it can easily test for certain components, there is interest for bioactive paper to be used in the packaging industry. Specifically, companies are considering bioactive paper as a way to detect counterfeit items or tampering. Other uses include microbial detection or possible antimicrobial properties.

Dick short story \\"Adjustment Team\\". Starring Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Anthony Mackie, John Slattery, and Terence Stamp, the film tells the story of a United States congressman who discovers that what appear to be chance events in his life are controlled by a mysterious, powerful group. After an event not planned by these controllers occurs ‚Äì a romantic encounter with a dancer ‚Äì he struggles against their manipulation despite their promise of a great future for him. The film was released on April 3, 2011. It was premiered at the Ziegfeld Theatre on February 14, 2011, and received positive reviews from critics, who praised Damon's performance and his chemistry with Blunt. It grossed $127 million against a production budget of $50 million.  Plot  In 2006, Brooklyn Congressman David Norris unsuccessfully runs for the United States Senate. While rehearsing his concession speech, David meets Elise Sellas. They share a passionate kiss, though he does not get her name. Inspired by her, David delivers an unusually candid speech that is well- received, making him a favorite for the next campaign. A month later, David prepares for a new job. At Madison Square Park, near David's home, a man named Harry Mitchell receives an assignment from his superior Richardson. Harry is to spill coffee on David's shirt by 7:05 AM so that David will miss his bus. However, Harry falls asleep; David boards the bus, happens to meet Elise again and gets her phone number. David arrives at work early and finds everyone in the building frozen and being examined by unfamiliar men. David attempts to escape, but is incapacitated and taken to a warehouse. Richardson reluctantly reveals to David the existence of the \\"Adjustment Bureau.\\" As its staff, Richardson and his men ensure people's lives proceed following \\"the Plan,\\" a complex document Richardson attributes to \\"the Chairman.\\" The Bureau confiscates and destroys the card with Elise's phone number, and David is warned that if he reveals the existence of the Bureau to anyone else, he will be \\"reset\\"‚Äîhis memory and personality erased. He is not to meet Elise again. Three years later, David again encounters Elise after coincidentally seeing her from a bus window; he tells her he has ridden that bus for three years, hoping to see her. He learns that she dances for Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet. The Bureau tries to prevent them from starting a relationship by altering their schedules and preventing them from meeting. David races across town, fighting the Bureau's efforts to \\"control his choices\\" and stop him from meeting Elise. During the chase the Bureau uses ordinary doorways to travel instantly to distant locations. Senior official Thompson takes over David's case and takes him to the warehouse, where David argues he has the right to choose his own path. Thompson says humanity received free will after the height of the Roman Empire, but then brought the Dark Ages upon itself. The Bureau took control after five centuries of barbarism, and created the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the scientific revolution. When free will was restored in 1910, it resulted in World War I, the Great Depression, Fascism, the Holocaust, and the Cuban Missile Crisis, forcing the Bureau to retake control. Thompson strongly implies that without Elise's influence David can become President of the United States, while Elise can become a world- famous dancer and choreographer, and that being together will ruin both of their futures. Thompson causes Elise to sprain her ankle at a performance to demonstrate his power, and David abandons her at the hospital to avoid ruining their futures as Thompson described. Eleven months later, as David campaigns again, Charlie, his campaign manager and lifelong best friend, tells David of Elise's imminent wedding. Harry contacts David via secret meetings in the rain or near water, which prevents the Bureau from tracking them. Harry reveals that Thompson exaggerated the negative consequences of David and Elise's relationship, and teaches David how to use doors to teleport and evade the Bureau. Just before the wedding David reaches Elise, reveals the Bureau's existence to her, and shows her how he travels through doors. As the Bureau pursues them across New York City, David decides to ask the Chairman to end the conflict and Elise chooses to accompany him. They enter the Bureau's offices with agents in pursuit. After a chase through the building, David and Elise find themselves surrounded on the observation deck of the GE Building. They declare their love and kiss before David can be caught. When they let go of each other, the Bureau members are gone. Thompson appears, but is interrupted by Harry, who shows him, and then David and Elise, their revised Plan from the Chairman: one that is blank starting from the current moment. Harry commends them for their devotion to each other, and says they are free to leave. As David and Elise walk away, Harry speculates that the Chairman may be preparing humanity to \\"one day\\" write its own Plan.  Cast  * Matt Damon as David Norris * Emily Blunt as Elise Sellas * Anthony Mackie as Harry Mitchell * John Slattery as Richardson * Michael Kelly as Charlie Traynor * Terence Stamp as Thompson, senior official of the Bureau * Donnie Keshawarz as Donaldson * Anthony Ruivivar as McCrady  Production  In early drafts, the character Norris was changed from a real-estate salesman, as in the short story, to an up-and-coming U.S. Congressman. = Financing = Media Rights Capital funded the film and then auctioned it to distributors, with Universal Studios putting in the winning bid for $62 million. Variety reported Damon's involvement on February 24, 2009, and Blunt's on July 14, 2009. The film was released on March 4, 2011. = Filming = Nolfi worked with John Toll as his cinematographer. Shots were planned in advance with storyboards, but changed often during shooting to fit the conditions of the day. The visual plan for the film was to keep the camerawork smooth using a dolly or crane and have controlled formal shots when the Adjustment Bureau was in full control, with things becoming more loose and using hand-held cameras when the story becomes less controlled. The final scene on the \\"Top of the Rock\\" rooftop observation deck of the GE Building in Rockefeller Center was filmed four months after the rest of the film had completed shooting and has a different ending from the original. = Music = The score was composed by Thomas Newman, with two songs by Richard Ashcroft (\\"Future's Bright\\" for the opening sequence; \\"Are You Ready?\\" for the closing credits). =Original ending= According to Nolfi there was an alternate ending, later revealed as featuring actress Shohreh Aghdashloo as the Chairman: > [I]nitially I was going to show the Chairman. The Chairman was going to be > in female form, too. Ultimately, while making the movie, I realized how > important it was going to be for people to put their own beliefs in the end > and not foreclose that. I don‚Äôt think the scene would have foreclosed > [people's] beliefs, but the more I could hint at it and the less explicit I > could be about it, it wasn‚Äôt enough to hint about it in the dialog and have > an actual person there acting it. I just had to not show the Chairman, so I > ended up not going that way. In her 2013 memoir, Aghdashloo said Nolfi gave her a different explanation. He blamed Universal Pictures for the change to the ending:  Religious themes  Some reviewers identified Abrahamic theological implications, such as an omnipotent and omniscient God, the concepts of free will and predestination, and elements from the descent to the underworld (a mytheme dating back at least to the story of Eurydice and Orpheus). Moreover, Cathleen Falsani said that the Chairman represents God, while his caseworkers are angels. The director of the film, George Nolfi, stated that the \\"intention of this film is to raise questions.\\"  Release  The film had its world premiere on February 14, 2011, at the Ziegfeld Theatre on 141 West 54th Street in New York City. Writer/director George Nolfi was in attendance along with the cast, including Matt Damon and Emily Blunt. = Box office = In its opening weekend in the United States (March 4‚Äì6, 2011), The Adjustment Bureau grossed $21,157,730, which was the second most of any film that weekend, behind Rango. Its total worldwide gross is $127,869,379 . = Critical response = The review- aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 71% based on reviews from 259 critics, and a weighted average of 6.6/10. The website's critical consensus states, \\"First-time writer/director George Nolfi struggles to maintain a consistent tone, but The Adjustment Bureau rises on the strong, believable chemistry of its stars.\\" At Metacritic, the film has a score of 60 out of 100 based on 41 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three out of four stars, describing it as \\"a smart and good movie that could have been a great one, if it had been a little more daring. I suspect the filmmakers were reluctant to follow its implications too far.\\" The New York Times called the film \\"a fast, sure film about finding and keeping love across time and space... [that] has brightened the season with a witty mix of science-fiction metaphysics and old- fashioned romance.\\" For the 2011 White House Correspondents' Dinner, United States President Barack Obama, while making humorous remarks about his sagging approval rating, said, \\"I've even let down my key core constituency: movie stars. Just the other day, Matt Damon...said he was disappointed in my performance. Well, Matt, I just saw The Adjustment Bureau, so right back atcha, buddy.\\" = Home media = The Adjustment Bureau was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on June 21, 2011. The film was the top selling release for its opening week.

Title page of David's Harp Strung and Tuned by William Nicholson Life The son of Christopher Nicholson, a rich clothier, he was born at Stratford St. Mary, Suffolk, on 1 November 1591. He became a chorister of Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1598, and received his education in the grammar school attached to the college. He graduated B.A. in 1611, and M.A. 1615.Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714, Nabbes-Nykke He was a bible clerk of the college from 1612 to 1615. In 1614 he was appointed to the college living of New Shoreham, Sussex. He held the office of chaplain at Magdalen from 1616 to 1618. He was also chaplain to Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland, during his imprisonment in the Tower of London, from 1606 to 1621, and was tutor to his son, Lord Percy. In 1616 he was appointed master of the free school at Croydon. He held the post till 1629, when he went to Wales, having been presented to the rectory of Llandilo-Vawr, in Carmarthenshire, in 1626. In 1644 he was made archdeacon of Brecon. The year before he had been nominated a member of the Westminster Assembly of divines, probably through the interest of the Earl of Northumberland, but he speedily withdrew, together with the most of the rest of the episcopalian clergy. When deprived of his preferments by the parliament he maintained himself by keeping a private school, which he carried on in partnership with Jeremy Taylor and William Wyatt at Newton Hall ('Collegium Newtoniense'), in the parish of Llanfihangel Aberbythych, in Carmarthenshire. One of his pupils was Judge John Powell. With Taylor, he wrote in the defence of the doctrine and discipline of the church of England, and in illustration of her teaching. His Exposition of the Apostles' Creed and Exposition of the Church Catechism were both written for the instruction of his former parishioners at Llandilo. At the Restoration Nicholson returned to his parish, and resumed his former preferments, to which was added a residentiary canonry at St. Davids. In 1661 he was consecrated bishop of Gloucester by Gilbert Sheldon and Accepted Frewen on 6 January, in Henry VII's Chapel. He was allowed to hold his archdeaconry and canonry together with the living of Bishops Cleeve in commendam. He preached in Westminster Abbey on 20 December 1661, at the funeral of Bishop Nicolas Monk, who had been consecrated with him in the preceding January. He was appointed to the sinecure rectory of Llansantfraid-yn-Mechan in Montgomeryshire in 1663. According to Richard Baxter, though not a commissioner, he attended the meetings of the Savoy Conference, and spoke once or twice. His treatment of the nonconformists in his diocese was conciliatory; he connived at the preaching of those whom he had reason to respect, and offered a living to one of them if he would conform. He was the patron of George Bull, who at his request was presented by Lord Clarendon to a living in his diocese. In 1663 he caused a new font to be erected in Gloucester Cathedral, and dedicated it; for this he was attacked in a pamphlet, entitled More News from Rome. He died on 5 February 1672, aged 72, and was buried in a side chantry of the lady-chapel at Gloucester, in which his wife Elizabeth, who predeceased him on 20 April 1663, had also been interred. A monument was erected by his grandson, Owen Brigstocke, of Lechdenny, Carmarthenshire, with an epitaph by his friend George Bull, describing him as 'legenda scribens, faciens scribenda.' Works He published: * A plain Exposition of the Church Catechism, 1655 (re-issued in the Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology). * Apology for the Discipline of the Ancient Church, 1659. * Plain Exposition of the Apostles' Creed (dedicated to Gilbert Sheldon), 1661. * David's Harp Strung and Tuned: Or, An Easy Analysis of the Whole Book of Psalms, 1662. Nicholson's name has been quoted as an authority in the controversy as to the authorship of Eikon Basilike. After her husband's death in 1662 the widow of John Gauden settled in Gloucester; on the occasion of her receiving communion, the bishop put the question to her, and she affirmed that it was written by her husband.

The student of Tadeusz Kotarbi≈Ñski and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, he specialized in logic and philosophy of language. Skolimowski earned a doctorate at the University of Oxford, where he also taught before he began his professorships at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, and then at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where he was for many years a professor of philosophy, and then held the position of professor emeritus. He was considered to be the leading thinker in the field of eco-philosophy. Skolimowski's work was targeted at overcoming human angst and disconnection caused in part by the overwhelming preponderance of modern technology, which had its seeds in the Industrial Revolution. Our accelerating dependence on technology at the expense of a right relationship with Nature and the planet is a prime concern within Skolimowski's work, as is the increasing inability of organized patriarchal religions to provide a meaningful spiritual platform from which modern human beings may appropriately evolve. During decades of travel and involvement with leading thinkers across the globe, Skolimowski had become familiar a great variety of cultures, and included winning precepts from them into his works. He was the author of over 50 books and hundreds of scientific and academic papers. He was also a poet. He wrote in English.

From this central assumption immediately follows reverence for life and for all there is, responsibility for the world and society, altruism and sharing as the basis for ethics, and ecological spirituality, which maintains that the ecological and the spiritual are one. * Swimming against the current of the disengaged academic philosophy, Skolimowski insisted, for the last four decades, that philosophy must be committed to life, must be living philosophy, helping life to unfold and to flourish. More recently, he proposed a new cosmology of light, according to which Light is the source of it all; it is truly a Great Mother; if we have the eyes to see and the mind to bear its greatness. Light is the source of all spiritualities and religions. * Skolimowski's passions were: hiking in the mountains - the higher the better; watching the sunrise over the Himalayas - it has been his sublime experience; also watching the stars in the mountains on moonless nights...and sometimes dialoguing with the stars. * creator of a new department of philosophy - eco-philosophy, Poland 1993 * Founder of the Eco-Philosophy Center based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA. 1981 * member of the President's Council for Environmental in Poland 1994/97 Awards and distinctions: * Gold Medal of Merit, Ministry of the Environment, Poland 1999 * Medal of the City of Wroclaw 1997 (for activities in the field of environmental protection in Poland) * Zielone Serce Przyrodzie, Warsaw 2001 Bibliography Books * 2011.

He was born in Glengarry County, Ontario, the son of Malcolm McNab and Margaret McCrimmon, and moved to Winnipeg in 1882 with his twin brother before establishing a homestead in Virden, Manitoba. Years of drought forced him to give up farming and in 1887 he became a grain buyer for Ogilvie Flour Mills. In 1892, McNab married Edith Wilson Todd. In 1902, the company transferred him to Rosthern, Saskatchewan where he invested in two grain elevators. After selling them, he moved to Saskatoon with his wife and children and established the Dominion Elevator Company. He also helped found the Saskatchewan Central Railway Company and the Saskatchewan Power Company. He entered politics and was elected to the Saskatchewan legislature in the 1908 general election as a Liberal MLA representing Saskatoon City. In government, he was appointed commissioner of municipal affairs and became Minister of Public Works in 1912. One of his accomplishments was helping acquire the University of Saskatchewan for Saskatoon. In 1922, he was also named Minister of Telephones. McNab retired from the legislature when he was appointed to the local government board in 1926 but was forced to resign in 1930 due to allegations of impropriety. In 1936, he was appointed lieutenant-governor. As provincial viceroy he hosted King George VI and Queen Elizabeth at Government House during their 1939 royal visit to Canada.

The structure was originally believed to have been a frontier blockhouse built by early settler James Swaggerty in 1787. Recent archaeological evidence suggests, however, that the structure was actually a cantilever barn built by a farmer named Jacob Stephens around 1860.David Mann, The Dendroarchaeology of the Swaggerty Blockhouse, Cocke County, Tennessee, p. iv. May 2002. Retrieved: 28 July 2009. PDF file. In the late 18th-century, blockhouses dotted East Tennessee and the Trans-Appalachian frontier, as attacks from hostile Cherokee and other Native Americans were a constant threat. While the Swaggerty Blockhouse bears some resemblance to historical blockhouse descriptions, it lacks common blockhouse characteristics such as gun portals. The Swaggerty Blockhouse's degree of cantilever (i.e., the degree to which the upper story extends outward beyond the lower story) is also greater than typical frontier blockhouses. Analysis of the tree rings in the Swaggerty Blockhouse's logs indicated a cutting date of 1860, well after the region's frontier period. Location The Swaggerty Blockhouse is located just east of Parrottsville along a stretch of U.S. Route 321/U.S. Route 411 known as Newport Highway. Clear Creek, a tributary of the French Broad River, passes a few yards west of the blockhouse. The creek slices a narrow, but fertile valley amidst the foothills of the Bald Mountains, which rise a few miles to the southeast. The farm on which the blockhouse stands is currently owned by the Gillespie family. Design Swaggerty Blockhouse, front view (from Newport Highway) The Swaggerty Blockhouse consists of three stories, with the first story being the smallest and the top story being the largest. The first story consists of a stone-and-mortar springhouse built around a natural spring which empties into Clear Creek a few yards away. A wellhouse adjacent to the first story was built in the middle 20th-century. The second level consists of hewn oak timbers notched with half-dovetail joints. While the hewing of the second story logs is relatively crude, its notching is very precise, giving it the strength to support the larger third story. Pegs and shelving on the second story indicate that it was once used for storage.Mann, pp. 3, 39-41. The third level consists of a poplar timber frame notched with mortise and tenon. This most notable feature of this level is its cantilever, or outward extension over the second story.Steve Rogers, Swaggerty Blockhouse. Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002. Retrieved: 28 July 2009. The walls have pane windows facing three directions. Wainscoting along the lower walls and the presence of a front-facing door indicate that this level was once used as a granary. A wooden staircase allows access to the third story. The third-story frame was later extended downward across the front of the second story. History THC marker on east end of the Swaggerty Blockhouse (20th-century wellhouse below) Frederick Swaggerty, a German immigrant, arrived in the Clear Creek area from Pennsylvania sometime around 1783.Mann, pp. 65-67. According to local sources, Swaggerty's son James built the Swaggerty Blockhouse in 1787, presumably to protect his family from hostile Cherokee attacks. If true, this would make the Swaggerty Blockhouse the only surviving blockhouse at its original site in the state of Tennessee.Robbie Jones, The Historic Architecture of Sevier County, Tennessee (Sevierville, Tenn.: Smoky Mountain Historical Society, 1997), pp. 183-184. In 1824, ownership of the Swaggerty property was passed to James Swaggerty who in turn sold it to Jacob Stephens in 1850. Over subsequent decades, Stephens established a fairly sizeable farm. At one point, Stephens owned 75 hogs and his farm was valued at $4,500. One-third of the farm's production consisted of pork products or corn. The Stephens family retained ownership of the farm until 1921, when it was sold to the Gillespie family. The Gillespies have since preserved the blockhouse. In 1973, the blockhouse was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Archaeological investigation In 2001, David Mann of the University of Tennessee conducted both a dendrochronological and standard archaeological study of the Swaggerty Blockhouse and adjacent grounds to determine the structure's age. The dendrochronological investigation, which essentially analyzed the tree rings of a structure's logs, determined that the Swaggerty Blockhouse's logs were cut sometime around 1860, and thus could not have been used in a late 18th- century blockhouse. Excavations around the blockhouse turned up cut nails and glass and ceramic artifacts, most all of which dated to the period between 1852 and 1864. Swine bones and ashes discovered on the north side of the blockhouse indicate that this area may have once been used for butchering hogs. Excavations also uncovered the remnants of a wagon road once leading to the door of the blockhouse.Mann, pp. 70, 80-90. =Blockhouse vs. cantilever barn= Mann concluded that the Swaggerty Blockhouse was likely a cantilever barn built around 1860 by Jacob Stephens, rather than a frontier blockhouse built by James Swaggerty in 1787. The Swaggerty Blockhouse lacks certain characteristics typical of a frontier blockhouse, such as gun portals and a short degree of cantilever (2 feet or less). The mortise-and-tenon notching and frame design of the third story are more indicative of a 19th-century cantilever barn. The cutting date of the structure's logs (ca. 1860) and the artifacts assembled from excavations on adjacent grounds provide the most compelling evidence for the later construction date. Most of the artifacts dated to the middle 19th-century, while there was an absence of artifacts (such as creamware and hand-wrought nails) typically found at 18th-century frontier sites. Mann surmises that the first story was likely a springhouse used for the storage of perishable foods (rather than a protected water supply), the second story used for storage of tools, and the third used for grain storage. Jacob Stephens, who was an active hog farmer, likely used the north side of the structure as a butchering area.

While the exact reason for such prolonged construction time is not known, it is believed that reduction of the French Navy's budget after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì71 and out-of-date work practices in French dockyards were likely causes.Ropp, pp. 31, 55‚Äì58 The ship was completed on 1 November 1878 and became the flagship of the second-in-command of the Mediterranean Squadron the following month.

History Carhouse (left) and powerhouse in 1905 The Groton and Stonington Street Railway was chartered on August 17, 1903, with permission to build two lines. The loop line in Groton was never constructed, but work began on the line from Groton to Stonington in early 1904. The G&S; opened from Groton to Mystic on December 19, 1904, to Stonington on April 8, 1905, and finally to the state line at Westerly on May 6, 1905. The trolley line started at Thames Street in Groton, passing through Poquonnock and Noank, and ending in Mystic. The company was headquartered in Mystic, and the powerhouse was located in between Water Street and the west bank of the Mystic River.

Native Americans of the West Indies discovered extracts from the tree could sedate fish, allowing them to be caught by hand. This practice led to the tree's common names‚Äîfishpoison and fishfuddle. The tree has medicinal value as an analgesic and sedative.Auxence, Elena G. 1953. A pharmacognostic study of Piscidia erythrina. Economic Botany 7(3): 270-284 The generic name is Latin for \\"fish killer\\", and the specific epithet is Latin for \\"little fish\\".Nellis, David N. 1994. Seashore plants of South Florida and the Caribbean: A guide to identification and propagation of xeriscape plants. Pineapple Press. 160 p. Habitat The Florida fishpoison tree grows in coastal zones. It prefers well-drained, sandy soils, with a top layer of humus.Institute for Regional Conservation: Jamaica-dogwood The tree has some tolerance to short-term storm surges of brackish water or seawater. Although it grows in coastal conditions, the tree is usually protected from direct salt spray by adjoining vegetation. Established trees are highly tolerant of drought. Its sensitivity to the cold limits Florida fishpoison tree to areas no colder than plant hardiness zone 11.  Description  The Florida fishpoison tree attains medium size with heights of 12 to 15 m and bole diameters of 46 to 118 cm. An irregular, open crown develops with stout, erect branches. Its deciduous leaves (9 to 23 cm long) are alternate and pinnately compound. Five to 11 leaflets (each 4 to 8 cm long) are present in an opposite arrangement. Leaflets are dark green above and distinctly paler grayish-green below with pubescence.Nelson, Gill. 1994. Trees of Florida: a reference and field guide. Pineapple Press. 338 p. Its white flowers are tinged with red or pink. They appear in pea-like clusters in May and are attractive to bees. Trees potentially bloom when about 4 m tall and 4 years old. Flowers develop into a light brown, bean-like pod (8 to 10 cm long) with four papery wings. Ripening in July and August, the pods contain red-brown seeds with oval shapes. Stem bark is thin and olive gray in color with irregular dark patches and many smaller scales. The bark has an unpleasant odor and a distinctly acrid and bitter taste, causing a burning sensation in the mouth. After removal from the ripe pod, seeds germinate in 8 to 10 days when sown about 6 mm deep in moist soil. Until seedlings become well established, they should be fertilized and watered. Cuttings placed in moist soil quickly sprout roots. In fact, rooting has been observed to occur so readily, posts made from fresh timber occasionally take root unintentionally. Ecology The Florida fishpoison tree is a larval host plant for several butterfly species, including: the native cassius blue butterfly (Leptotes cassius) and hammock skipper (Polygonus leo) and the introduced fulvous hairstreak (Electrostrymon angelia). Uses=Cultivation= In areas with a suitable climate and soils, Florida fishpoison tree makes a hardy, medium- sized shade tree with attractive seasonal flowers. It is ideal for yards and along fence rows. The species is shade intolerant, requiring full sunlight for maximum development. =Lumber= The yellow-brown wood of fishpoison tree is resistant to decay, making its timber suitable for outdoor usage, such as boat building, fence posts, and poles. The dense, tight-grained wood is also used as a fuel, to make charcoal, and as a good carving material. =Fishing= Indigenous peoples all over the world used local poisonous plants to aid in catching fish, and because of this many plants bear common names descriptive of this use.Kritzon, Chuck. Fishing with poisons. Primitive Ways. Within its natural range, Native Americans used an extract from the bark, roots, twigs, and leaves of Florida fishpoison tree to sedate fish, making them easier to catch. A number of chemicals present in the tree's tissues are toxic to fish, the principal one being the well-known rotenone. =Herbal medicine= P. piscipula can be toxic and should only be used under direction of a doctor.University of Maryland Medical Center. Jamaica dogwood. Dosage must be individually determined It has been used in herbal medicine for treating nervous conditions and pain. Recent scientific studies in animals suggest that bark extracts may have potential for their anti-inflammatory, sedative, and antispasmodic effects.

Writing career and awards Before publishing her first novel, Russell's career started in a variety of writing fields, beginning as a newspaper columnist in college. Upon graduation, she worked as a broadcast journalist, newspaper reporter, magazine columnist, technical writer and editor and instructional designer. Russell's first award was the Romance Writers of America Golden Heart in 1998 for her paranormal romance, Remember Me. She won another Golden Heart in 2002 in the short historical category with The Warrior Trainer. The same book won the American Title II contest, sponsored by Romantic Times Bookreviews magazine and Dorchester Publishing in 2006. Russell began writing when her daughter was three years old. Prior to selling The Warrior Trainer to Dorchester Publishing, Russell wrote seven novels, several partials and sought publication for thirteen years. For the November 2009 issue of RT Book Reviews Magazine (issue #309), Russell interviewed Diana Gabaldon about her seventh book in the Outlander series, An Echo in the Bone. Personal life and interests A history buff from a young age, Russell's novels are based on real-life historic people from the early 14th century. Her goal is to not leave footprints on history while writing. Russell's fascination with history extended to her spare time where she often worked for one weekend each summer as a living history re-enactor at the Shrewsbury Reinaissance Faire in Kings Valley, Oregon. The Warrior Trainer Scotia, the heroine in Russell's first novel, The Warrior Trainer, is based on a real-life female from Scotland's history. Russell first learned of Scotia while at a demonstration by the Seattle Knights. Her research involved finding a first source reference that linked Scotia to Scotland's past. Russell discovered evidence of Scotia's existence in a book detailing the lineage of Scottish kings.

It is endemic to California, where it is known from four populations in the Presidio of San Francisco and one occurrence on San Bruno Mountain south of San Francisco.California Native Plant Society Rare Plant Profile It is a state and federally listed endangered species. The already rare plant is endangered by many processes, including invasive species, development, sand mining, off-road vehicles and bulldozers, habitat fragmentation, trampling, and pollution, as well as stochastic events.US Fish & Wildlife Service. Endangered status for the plant Lessingia germanorum (San Francisco Lessingia) from California. Federal Register 62:118. June 19, 1997. This is an annual herb producing a decumbent to erect, reddish stem no more than 30 centimeters long. The deeply lobed leaves are up to 3 or 4 centimeters long. Some leaves and new stem parts are coated in woolly fibers. The inflorescence is a solitary flower head or cluster of heads at the tip of the stem. The bell-shaped involucre is lined with pointed phyllaries that curl back as the head matures. The head is discoid, with no ray florets but several tubular golden disc florets with raylike lobes. The plant blooms in July through November.Golden Gate National Recreation Area: 2008 Endangered Species Big Year The fruit is an achene with a whitish pappus. This plant grows in beach sand dunes and scrub and similar sandy habitat. It is native to the tip of the San Francisco Peninsula, a land mass which is intensely developed and urbanized. The single population known on San Bruno Mountain near Daly City was discovered in 1989 and is threatened by the construction of houses in the immediate vicinity. The largest population of the plants is in the dunes at the mouth of Lobos Creek in the San Francisco Presidio. Habitat in the area is infested with non-native species such as ice plant (Carpobrotus sp.), which produces mats of herbage over the sand dunes, stabilizing the sand; the lessingia requires shifting, windblown sand habitat. Introduced trees have also altered the habitat of the lessingia. Old Monterey cypress (Cupressus macrocarpa) and Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) planted many decades ago remain in the Presidio dunes; these native California trees are not native to this particular ecosystem, and have become detrimental.Schwartz, K.

Early life Thelma was born in Richmond, Virginia on 14 October 1891. She was the daughter of Frederick Dallas Cudlipp and Annie (n√©e Ericsson) Cudlipp. Her mother died in Bermuda on 24 June 1915. After her father died in Virginia in 1903, then in her teens, she came to New York City to study art. Her mother was an assistant editor on The Delineator in 1909 when Theodore Dreiser was managing editor. Dreiser became infatuated with Thelma, but her mother was strongly opposed to Dreiser's involvement with her daughter, which was platonic, because Dreiser was married and 20 years her senior. Thelma's mother succeeded in breaking up the relationship by sending Thelma to England and by reporting it to the directors of the Butterick Publishing Company, which cost Dreiser his job. Artistic career \\"Mme. Geraldine Farrar in Greek Costume as Tha√Øs\\" / Thelma Cudlipp frontispiece Woman as Decoration / Emily Burbank (New York: Dodd, Mead and Company, 1917) In England, Cudlipp continued her training in art, winning but not accepting a Royal Academy scholarship. When she returned to the U.S., she took lessons from Kenneth Hayes Miller, one of Dreiser's friends. She became well known as an illustrator for various newspapers and magazines, such as Harper's, The Century Magazine, McClure's, and The Saturday Evening Post. In addition to her own work, she developed an interest in pre-Columbian sculpture, which she collected and promoted through lectures. She later developed a friendship with Dreiser, but it was not of a romantic nature. They exchanged letters with each other until Dreiser's death. In 1932, Thelma had an exhibition of her paintings at the Marie Sterner Galleries. In 1933, she was \\"declared the winner of the popular prize of $25\\" for her painting, entitled Victorian Place, in the annual exhibition of the Newport Art Association. Personal life In 1918, she married Edwin Prescott Grosvenor (1875‚Äì1930), a successful attorney with Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, and cousin of former president William Howard Taft. Edwin was the son of Edwin A. Grosvenor and brother of Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor, who married Elsie May Bell (daughter of Alexander Graham Bell). Together, they were the parents of two daughters: * Anne Somerville Grosvenor (1919‚Äì2001), who married Dwight Edwards Robinson Jr. in 1945. * Louise Taft Grosvenor (1921‚Äì1987), who married Sumner Gerard in 1945. They divorced in 1966, and he later served as the U.S. Ambassador to Jamaica. After her husband's death in 1930, she married Charles Seymour Whitman in 1933. Whitman had been governor of New York from 1915 to 1918. He died in 1947.Time Magazine, 17 April 1933 She died on 2 April 1983 in Greenwich, Connecticut.

Campbell, 1 U.S. 10 (1764) is a decision of a Pennsylvania provincial court, issued when Pennsylvania was still an English colony. It is among the first decisions that appear in the first volume of United States Reports, and is among the earliest surviving reports of judicial proceedings in North America. It is also one of the first applications of the Statute of Frauds, then an established principle of English law, in the English colonies that later became the first thirteen states of the United States of America. Colonial and Early State Court Cases in the United States Reports None of the decisions appearing in the first volume and most of the second volume of the United States Reports are actually decisions of the United States Supreme Court. Instead, they are decisions from various Pennsylvania courts, dating from the colonial period and the first decade after Independence. Alexander Dallas, a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania lawyer and journalist, had been in the business of reporting these cases for newspapers and periodicals. He subsequently began compiling his case reports in a bound volume, which he called \\"Reports of cases ruled and adjudged in the courts of Pennsylvania, before and since the Revolution\\".Cohen, Morris and O'Connor, Sharon H. A Guide to the Early Reports of the Supreme Court of the United States, (Fred B. Rothman & Co, Littleton Colorado, 1995) This would come to be known as the first volume of \\"Dallas Reports.\\" When the United States Supreme Court, along with the rest of the new Federal Government, moved in 1791 to the nation's temporary capital in Philadelphia, Dallas was appointed the Supreme Court's first unofficial and unpaid Supreme Court Reporter. (Court reporters in that age received no salary, but were expected to profit from the publication and sale of their compiled decisions.) Dallas continued to collect and publish Pennsylvania decisions in a second volume of his Reports, and when the Supreme Court began hearing cases, he added those cases to his reports, starting towards the end of the second volume, \\"2 Dallas Reports\\". Dallas would go on to publish a total of 4 volumes of decisions during his tenure as Reporter. In 1874, the U.S. government created the United States Reports, and numbered the volumes previously published privately as part of that series, starting from the first volume of Dallas Reports. The four volumes Dallas published were retitled volumes 1 - 4 of United States Reports.Hall, Kermit, ed. Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States (Oxford 1992), p 215, 727 As a result, decisions appearing in these early reports have dual citation forms; one for the volume number of the United States Reports, and one for the set of reports named for the reporter (called nominative reports). For example, the complete citation to Lessee of Richardson v. Campbell is 1 U.S. 10 (1 Dallas 10) (1764). The Decision Dallas's report of this case, as with many of his early decisions, does not include the actual language of the court's decision, but only describes the proceedings in the incomplete and general terms that has evoked criticism from later generations.Raymond J. Walters, Jr. Alexander James Dallas: Lawyer - Politician -- Financier (New York: Da Capo Press 1969) p. 102. As with many of the first cases reported by Dallas, this case involved a dispute over title to land in the Pennsylvania colony. The unnamed plaintiff, a tenant (lessee) of landowner Richardson, and whose right to possession of the leased land depended on Richardson's good title to the land, thus found himself defending Richardson's title to the land. The tenant sued Campbell, an opposing claimant to the same real property. The plaintiff offered a patent dated 1762, which granted title in the disputed land to Richardson, or Richardson's predecessor in title. The defendant Campbell offered receipts showing payments made to the Secretary of the Land Office, one Mr. Peters, several years prior to Richardson's patent. The plaintiff argued that those payments were for an adjacent tract of land. The defendant Campbell then offered a witness who was prepared to testify that Thomas Penn, the son of Pennsylvania colony founder William Penn, and who had been Proprietor of the Colony of Pennsylvania during the relevant times, had verbally stated that the land in dispute had been sold to Campbell. The plaintiff objected to this testimony, and the Court refused to allow the witness to testify. The Statute of Frauds in Colonial Courts Though not mentioned by name, this case appears to be one of the first applications of the Statute of Frauds in the colonies. That rule, enacted by the British Parliament over eighty years before this decision was rendered, required (and in versions passed in every state in the UnionLouisiana, with its civil law tradition, has enacted a partial version of the Statute of Frauds. still requires today) that certain transactions, including transactions involving interests in land, must be in writing, signed by the party against whom the transaction is sought to be enforced. The Court specifically ruled that the evidence of Thomas Penn's parol (verbal) transaction would not be admitted at the trial of this case. Precedential Effect The principle that transactions involving interests in land had to be in writing, signed by the \\"party to be charged\\" was well established by the Revolution, and appears in numerous colonial and early state court decisions. Infrequently, this decision was cited in support of that proposition. This decision was last known to be cited in or by a court of record in 1872, by a litigant in Kraut's Appeal, 71 Pa. 64, (Pa. 1872) who cited it before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court for the premise that the right to pass through defendants' house could not be shown by parol (that is, verbal evidence).

It was designated March 30, 2009, as part of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009. Located near the town of Hildale in southeastern Washington County, it borders Zion National Park to the north, Kane County to the east, and the state of Arizona to the south.Map of Canaan Mountain Wilderness - Bureau of Land Management Topography Canaan Mountain is the namesake of the wilderness. It is a large promontory surrounded on three sides by the high White Cliffs composed of Navajo Sandstone. The Vermilion Cliffs, composed of the Moenave Formation, lie at the base of the White Cliffs. The two formations are separated by a wide bench of the Kayenta Formation's soft mudstones. The Navajo Sandstone surface of Canaan Mountain has been carved into ridges, hummocks, hollows, and passageways. Vegetation Canaan Mountain Wilderness scarlet monkeyflower Most of the area is dominated by ponderosa pine and Douglas fir scattered among large areas of slickrock. Pinyon pine, manzanita, Gambel oak, and Indian ricegrass are found on the pockets of soil amid the slickrock. The lower slopes on the eastern side of the wilderness and at the base of the White Cliffs support pinyon-juniper with serviceberry, manzanita, and various grasses. Riparian areas are found along South Creek, Water Canyon Creek, Squirrel Creek and several other drainages; maidenhair fern, shooting star, scarlet monkeyflower, and columbine grow in hanging gardens by cliff- side springs and seeps.Canaan Mountain Wilderness - Wilderness.net Wildlife The western half of Canaan Mountain Wilderness is home to a number of peregrine falcons. South Creek and the northwest side are important winter range for mule deer. Bighorn sheep were reintroduced in Zion National Park in 1977 and can now occasionally be found in the wilderness. Other animals include mountain lion, coyote, bobcat, Gambel's quail, mourning dove, several species of nesting raptor, and a number of sensitive animals including the desert shrew, spotted bat, Lewis's woodpecker, and golden eagle. Human history Hunting camps of the Virgin River Ancestral Puebloans and Southern Paiutes are likely to be present, but are as yet unidentified. A pulley system and collapsed buildings are remnants of logging on Canaan Mountain between 1915 and 1928.

The character first appeared on-screen on 25 November 2008, during the first series of the Hollyoaks spin-off, Hollyoaks Later, as the former love interest of Malachy Fisher. She made her first appearance in main Hollyoaks episodes in July 2009, introduced to the serial by series producer, Lucy Allan. In 2010 when Paul Marquess began producing the serial, he felt that Cheryl was being used in the wrong way, subsequently making her a central character to the show. It was announced on 1 February 2013 that Waugh quit her role. Cheryl departed Hollyoaks on 22 March 2013, after four years on the show. Character creation=Background= The character of Cheryl was created to help correctly show a cross-section of young people in British society. Cheryl was given immediate links to Malachy Fisher (Glen Wallace), being his ex- girlfriend and Kris Fisher (Gerard McCarthy) who also knew her from his time living in Belfast. When Cheryl was introduced to the main cast she had already established links with character Zak Ramsey (Kent Riley), who she had previously shared a fling with. Series producer Lucy Allan also stated she had big plans for the character. Bronagh Waugh and Ricky Whittle (Calvin Valentine) discussed why they believed the character was introduced into the main series stating: \\"I think they brought me in to lighten it [Hollyoaks] up.\\" and \\"They have brought Cheryl in to introduce a bit of comedy, a bit more fun.\\" =Casting= Actress Bronagh Waugh received a call to audition for the part of Cheryl in 2008. At first Waugh thought it was a mistake because she did not see herself fitting in with the typical stereotype of the female cast. Waugh went on to get the part, which was initially a short term stint in spin- off series, Hollyoaks Later. After Waugh had impressed series producer Lucy Allan, Waugh was called back and offered a one-year contract to appear in the main series. On hearing the news Waugh jumped up and down screaming, claiming she didn't think she would get the call back. Initially the casting department were looking for an actress that weighed far more, but couldn't find anyone and decided to find someone of normal size with curves. Of the part she said: \\"I think it's good to see someone with flaws. I feel an enormous responsibility to younger viewers who may be watching and going 'oh my God, the girls in Hollyoaks are so skinny and gorgeous' and I really want to stand up for ordinary girls.\\" Waugh also credited actor Gerard McCarthy who plays Kris Fisher in the series for helping her secure the role. In January 2010, Waugh announced she was staying with Hollyoaks until at least April 2011 after signing an 18-month contract. Speaking to PA, Waugh explained: \\"It is quite long actually. Most people are six months or a year. But I'm glad they've let me know longer term because at least you're not going 'Should I look for another job?'. I can really put my head down and concentrate and enjoy the next couple of years.\\" She also admitted she was \\"happy\\" to stick with the show for another two years, but believes it will be \\"time to go\\" after that. She continued: \\"It's such a big character that I wouldn't want to get pigeon- holed in just that type of thing.\\" Development=Characterisation= Cheryl has an outlandish personality, she is loud and a larger than life character, speaking on in conjunction with this series producer Lucy Allan made a comment stating \\"You can't have anything but big with Cheryl, can you?\\" Waugh has also compared her to a popular cartoon character stating: \\"She's like the Tasmanian devil, just a whirlwind hurricane leaving carnage in her wake and then totters off as if that's completely normal and goes and buys a loaf of bread.\\" She has also spoke about her character's softer side stating: \\"She's like a bulldozer, she just storms in and goes nuts, and she's a real maneater. But at the same time what I love is that they let me show her vulnerability. If you're a big two-dimensional comedy character, it's good fun for a couple of weeks but then that's it. I think someone who's as brash and brazen as her needs to show a flip-side, there's a reason why she acts the way she does and we get to see that too.\\" The official E4 publicity describes her as 'the bubbly tart with a heart‚Äô and states that she spells out trouble for the males and causes a ruckus for the females. During an interview on loose Women Waugh spoke about her character stating: \\"I play the maneater of the village that tries to get them all but it doesn't really work.\\" Cheryl is often seen in many outlandish outfits consisting of hot pants and items of many bright colours. Waugh was stated that she doesn't mind the outfits because they remain true to her larger-than-life personality. She also said that Cheryl has a lot of confidence in order to dress the way she does. =Malachy Fisher= Cheryl's only long term relationship with a fellow character was with Malachy Fisher (Glen Wallace), their relationship happened off-screen. The characters have often been shown recalling how good they were together, although it was Malachy who left her. She has shown a keen interest in a strew on male characters since her first appearance but always seems to be unlucky in love. Speaking of Malachy and other men Waugh spoke about their special connection saying:\\"I think Cheryl is kinda after everyone, she'll be eternally after Malachy he'll always hold a very special place in his heart for her, shes after a lot of other boys, but I think there will always be a connection between Malachy and Cheryl throughout all the time they stay on the show.\\" She was later paired with the character Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan) for a few months, but their relationship was ruined after Cheryl found out he was actually in love with Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson). =Departure= On 1 February 2013, it was announced that Waugh had decided to leave Hollyoaks. Her last scenes as Cheryl will air in March and will see her depart during the same week as Emmett Scanlan, who plays Cheryl's brother Brendan. Of her decision to leave, Waugh stated \\"Deciding to leave Hollyoaks was tough - I have had the most incredible four years on the show and the cast and crew really are like my family - but it just feels like the right time for me and for Cheryl.\\" Waugh revealed that she was keen to pursue new acting role in Ireland and the UK. Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly reported that Cheryl and Brendan's departures will occur during an \\"explosive week\\" of Hollyoaks. Cheryl leaves with her boyfriend Nate to start married life. Storylines Cheryl first appeared in Hollyoaks Later when Malachy and Kris returned home for their father's funeral. She then continually clashed with Malachy's fianc√©e Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe). She eventually convinced Malachy to go ahead with the wedding despite her still present feelings for him.

She first appeared in the Hollyoaks village in the back of a taxi and visited Malachy at the McQueen's, claiming she was looking for Zak Ramsey, whom she had shared a kiss with. On learning Zak was attending the funeral of Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas), she and Malachy went to find him. Michaela McQueen (Hollie-Jay Bowes) displayed her dislike for Cheryl and was jealous. Sasha Valentine (Nathalie Emmanuel) ordered a noisy Cheryl to leave the church and, on her exit, she walked into Mercedes. The pair ended up in a fight and were restrained by Calvin and Malachy. Cheryl revealed to Malachy and Kris that the reason she is in Hollyoaks village was because a man had died whilst having sex with her and she was scared the police might arrest her, however Kris later informed her that the police were not looking for her. Steph gave Cheryl a job at MOBs and she moved into the Halls. Cheryl began looking after Spencer Gray (Darren John Langford) in an attempt to get closer to Calvin, but showed genuine guilt when she allowed Calvin to refer Spencer to a care home as he couldn't cope with him.

Cheryl later tells the police that she believes Mercedes is involved in Calvin's death, Malachy tells the police it was him. Cheryl wins ¬£250,000 on the lottery. After her lottery win Cheryl's brother Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan) turns up and convinces her to buy The Loft, which she renames \\"Chez Chez\\". Cheryl's best friend Lynsey also arrives in the village. Cheryl's old friend, Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan), turns up, and Cheryl is delighted to see her. Cheryl informs her she fancies Malachy, and Lynsey is too afraid to admit she does too.

One reported source stated that during 2011 Derrick Thomas Academy administration and governance did not report to its sponsor (University of Missouri at Kansas City) that they would part its ways from Edison Learning. Due to the lack of communication, the University of Missouri at Kansas City put the school on probation in its ten-year charter with the school. Before the probation, during the 2008 - 2009 school year, when the school faced new administration and fired almost half of the faculty due to unforeseen issues, is when Derrick Thomas Academy encountered its reasons for closure. These include factors such as low test scores, lack of financial stability, and lack of governance. Even though Derrick Thomas Academy received many signs of possible closure, the school continued to do poorly. Finally an executive decision was made by the University of Missouri at Kansas City Charter School Center in May 2013, not to renew nor continue its remaining charter with Derrick Thomas Academy. During its last year the school was in crisis and didn't have its own administrator on site so the board asked another principal from a charter school in Kansas City to be an on site administrator for the school. After the school closed many of the faculty did not receive a final paycheck and the school board filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a $10 million lawsuit that is currently pending. Partnerships The Derrick Thomas Academy worked in partnership with the Kansas City Chiefs Football Association for whom the late football great Derrick Thomas played, the Derrick Thomas Third and Long Foundation, and the University of Missouri at Kansas City (UMKC).

The saying that An engineer can do for a dollar what any fool can do for two is attributed to him. He was involved in the design and construction of new railways in Mexico. He was chief engineer of the Toledo and Canada Southern Railroad. He was the editor of the Engineering News. The pioneering effort of Wellington in engineering economics in the 1870s was continued by John Charles Lounsbury Fish with the publication of Engineering Economics: First Principles in 1923 and the first publication of the Principles of Engineering Economy in 1930 by Eugene L. Grant. Early Life and Works He was born on December 25, 1847, in Waltham, Massachusetts. In 1878, he married Agnes Bates, and they had two children. Wellington was a descendant of Roger Wellington, an early settler of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1636 and Benjamin Wellington. In 1863, Wellington graduated from the Boston Latin School and then studied engineering with John Benjamin Henck, a prominent civil engineer practicing in Boston. While his work with Henck took place during the American civil war, he studied mechanical engineering and passed the examination for an assistant engineer in the United States Navy but with the end of the War, never received an appointment. Buffalo, New York & Philadelphia railroad pass issued by Albert Fink Surveyor and locating engineer Wellington left Henck's office in 1866 to work as a surveyor in the engineers corps at the Brooklyn Parks department on the Prospect Park project under Frederick Law Olmsted. In 1868, he took a position as a surveyor on a locating party for the Blue Ridge railroad in South Carolina in charge of a series of explorations to find possible routes for the railroad. Wellington left the South Carolina road and went on to practice location engineering for the Dutchess & Columbia railroad in New York state. He left that road in 1870 to work on the Buffalo, New York & Philadelphia railroad as a division engineer for the next three years. He continued in this position until the financial panic of 1873 put a sudden stop to railway construction. He was appointed as Chief Engineer of the Toledo and Canada Southern Railway in 1872. He then went to work for the Buffalo and Erie Railroad, the West Farms Railway and the Canadian Great Western Railway. He was made engineer in charge of the Mexican National Railway in March 1881, and afterward, he became the Assistant General Manager of the Mexican Central Railway. He returned to Manhattan, New York City and became one of the editors of The Railroad Gazette in 1884.  Honors  He then became editor and part owner of The Engineering News. In 1891, Wellington was elected a member of the Canadian Society of Civil Engineers. Death  Wellington died on May 17, 1895, from heart failure following surgery in Manhattan, New York City, at age 47. He was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City.

The 5th edition had the subtitle An analysis of the conditions controlling the laying out of railways to effect the most judicious expenditure of capital.

But with Dean moving on it just feels like the right time.\\" In August 2011 Margolis confirmed he had decided to stay on at Hollyoaks after he had been offered a new storyline. In May 2012, Margolis revealed via his Twitter account that was leaving again, but this time his exit storyline had already been written. He will film his final scenes as Ricky in June 2012. Character development E4 publicity describe Ricky as being permanently attached to his skateboard, they also brand him \\"an abundance of energy\\". They describe his appearance as typical \\"boyish good looks\\" and as having a \\"cheeky sense of humour\\". Ricky's first main storyline was being the sole carer to his father Martin Campbell (Grant Masters), who is suffering from multiple sclerosis. Margolis said he was grateful for the storyline and revealed he put extensive research into the storyline. Speaking of the storyline during an interview with the Press Association, Margolis stated: \\"I was so grateful I was given the opportunity to do it. Having done research on it, about what young carers have to go through every day, [you realise] it's a hard life. It's brilliant what they do and hopefully this storyline will get people to realise, 'That's what I'm going through'.\\" Margolis also revealed he found it hard to lift Masters in scenes he was caring for him adding that it tired him out and sympathised with those who go through it in real life. It was later revealed that charity Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain had been helping with the storyline, they released a statement reading: \\"The MS Society understands this is likely to be a dramatic portrayal of MS and its symptoms. While we have advised script writers on how best to progress the storyline the ultimate character interpretation is in the hands of the soaps' producers.\\" Storylines=Backstory= Ricky, an only child, was born to Martin, who later develops multiple sclerosis. He had to become the full-time carer of his father after his grandmother could no longer help out, often finding it hard to adapt his social life whilst trying to cope with the daily household jobs. =2009‚Äì12= He first arrived to meet Anita for a date, however because she was using Theresa McQueen's (Jorgie Porter) picture, he appeared looking for a blonde girl. He is 14 although was using a picture of someone else and claimed to be 20. He arrived with flowers for Anita but seen Theresa, who he thought was Anita, kissing Newt (Nico Mirallegro). He confronted Theresa, who assumed he was crazy as she had never seen him before. Meanwhile, a stood up Anita with Lauren passed Ricky outside Il Gnosh, they glanced at each other for a second but neither of them knew that the other was in fact the person they were meeting for the date. He recorded Theresa and Newt acting more than friends on his phone and showed it to Anita. She went to kiss him until Ash kicked Ricky out. He appeared a few weeks later when Anita and her friends went camping in a nearby field. However things did not turn out like Ricky had expected as Anita discovered his camper bag was full of condoms. Despite this, he apologised for his behaviour. During his paper round at Drive 'n' Buy, Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan) and Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) found marijuana in Ricky's bag. They confronted him, with Anita. Anita was shocked and when he was asked to pick between his job and not getting to keep the marijuana or keeping the marijuana and losing his job, Ricky ran out with the bag. Anita followed him refusing to believe he would take drugs. Ricky continued seeing Anita, and in September 2009, went to a cottage with Anita, Newt and Lauren Valentine (Dominique Jackson), although their break was ruined when Gaz Bennett (Joel Goonan) arrived and started causing trouble. Gaz punched Ricky after he tried to stand up for Anita, and tried to convince the others to run away. Gaz was hit over the head by one of the gang, eventually revealed to be Anita, although Lauren believed the culprit was Ricky. Ricky continued to support Anita as she went through difficulties with her family after discovering she was adopted, and also stood by her despite knowing what she did to Gaz. Ricky struck a friendship with Duncan, who pressured him into having sex with Anita. Ricky, however, decided to wait, and was jealous when Anita decided that she wanted to lose her virginity to Dave Colburn (Elliot James Langridge). Ricky began disappearing for long periods of time and it turned out Ricky was caring for his father Martin Campbell (Grant Masters) who is suffering with multiple sclerosis and that Ricky often had to get cannabis for Martin to relieve his pain. On different occasions Martin tells Ricky to go out and enjoy himself, often injuring himself whilst Ricky is not present and calling him to come back home for help. This begins to affect Ricky's school work. Whilst Ricky is offered support, Kris Fisher (Gerard McCarthy) accidentally assaults him. Ricky tells Martin he does not want to go to hospital in case his arm is broken meaning he can no longer look after him. Soon though, after going to Ricky's home, Kris finds out about Martin's MS, and when Martin suddenly takes ill, Kris has to phone a hospital, where Ricky is terrified of being find out, however eventually he gets to take his father home. Things took a sinister tone though when Ricky told Kris that if he were to tell social services about his father's problems and condition, he would tell the school about what happened to his arm, Kris reluctantly agreed to keep the secret. Kris began to help Ricky and Martin and would often stay the night and help with the daily routine. When Kris rang the paramedics, Ricky was angry and worried that he would be put into care however the Ashworths agreed to let him stay and Ricky realised Martin was in the best place whilst in hospital. Ricky was last seen living with the Ashworths however he did not appear when they left. Ricky is later seen again in December, when he becomes part of Lee Hunter's Boy Band Guy Candy, also becomes friends with Duncan's sister Ruby Button (Anna Shaffer) when she arrives in January. Ricky left Hollyoaks in August 2012 on results day after messing up his exams. Reception When Ricky dumped Ruby via text message a Sunday Mail critic said that it was \\"not a smart move on his part\\" because he risked the wrath of three best friends.

Plot Relatives and friends came to Lord Warbeck's family castle for Christmas. Suddenly, right during dinner, Robert Warbeck, the only son and heir of the old Lord, dies in front of the guests. Then Lord Warbeck himself. And then ‚Äî one of the guests in the house ladies... Because of snow drifts to arrive at the police can not; the only police present ‚Äî not an investigator, and the Minister's guard. Foreigner doctor Batfink ‚Äî historian, invited by Lord Warbeck to work in his old library ‚Äî is the only one who is able to understand what had happened. However, the investigation is very complicated by the fact that almost all those present are connected with each other by strange, not the most pleasant and sometimes very unexpected relationships‚Ä¶  Changes from the novel  Overall, the film closely follows the novel. The introduction is compressed. The excursion undertaken by Sir Julius to a nearby village (Chapter XIV in the novel) has been completely removed from the film. Noticeable changes have been made to soften the political conflict depicted in the novel. * In the novel, Doctor Wenceslaus Bottwink, Ph.D., professor of History, is said to be born in Hungary, having Jewish and Russian blood in his make-up. Fortunate to escape a Nazi concentration camp, he found himself on the shores of Great Britain. In the film, neither the first name nor ethnicity of Doctor Bottwink is revealed, and it is only said that he was a citizen of Austria, then Czechoslovakia, then Germany as the Second World War progressed. * In the novel, the League of Liberty and Justice, organized by Robert Warbeck, is a fascist organization. In the film the League is described as merely extremist. * In the novel, Robert Warbeck is clearly antisemitic, unable to contain his political leanings even when talking to Lady Camilla, bursting, \\"Has your new Jew friend asked you to go back to Palestine with him yet?\\" In the film this dialogue has been removed, although the nationalistic character of Robert's organization is established. * In the novel, sergeant Rogers inquires Doctor Bottwink whether the Doctor was in Vienna during Dolfuss r√©gime, and Doctor Bottwink clarifies that he was anti-Dolfuss, anti- clerical, and anti-Fascist. This dialog is removed from the film. * In the novel, Sir Julius identifies himself as socialist. When thinking back about the murders that occurred in Warbeck Hall, he comes to a conclusion that it was him who was targeted, and only by chance he was spared. \\"Who are the real enemies of communism today? Why, we are ‚Äî the democratic socialists of Western Europe!\\" exclaims Sir Julius, blaming Doctor Bottwink in the murders. This exchange is removed from the film, and Sir Julius is never called a socialist. * Like the novel, the film reveals that Doctor Bottwink is a communist sympathizer, but omits to mention his anti-Stalinist stance. * In the novel, Sir Julius and Mrs. Carstairs argue about the looting of the Winter Palace at Pekin and the suppression of the Boxer revolt by Eight Nation Alliance. This argument is removed from the film.

It was released as the third single from the album in September 1966, reaching number 36 on the Billboard Hot 100, but failing to chart in the United Kingdom. Upon its release as a single, the music press coined the term \\"space-rock\\" to describe it, although since then, this term has come to refer to a genre of rock music originating from 1970s progressive and psychedelic music. Composition and release Written in early 1966 by Byrds member Jim McGuinn, the song was‚Äîalong with \\"5D (Fifth Dimension)\\"‚Äîone of two science fiction-themed songs on the Fifth Dimension album. Initially conceived as a \\"melodramatic screenplay\\", the song soon evolved into a whimsical meditation on the existence of extraterrestrial life. Musically, \\"Mr. Spaceman\\" has a country-style backing, albeit with touches of psychedelia, and can clearly be seen as a precursor to the band's later exploration of country music on Sweetheart of the Rodeo. As such, the song has been cited by critics as one of the earliest examples of country rock. The title also recalled that of the Byrds' earlier worldwide smash hit and debut single, \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\". The single release of the song was accompanied by a spoof press announcement from the Byrds' co-manager, Eddie Tickner, stating that he had taken out a $1,000,000 insurance policy with Lloyd's of London against his clients being kidnapped by extraterrestrial visitors. Despite Tickner's statement being an obvious publicity stunt and the deliberately tongue-in-cheek nature of the song's lyrics, both McGuinn and fellow band member David Crosby felt hopeful about communicating with alien life forms through the medium of AM radio broadcast. In a later interview with Pete Frame for ZigZag magazine, McGuinn explained how he believed that this would have been possible: \\"I was interested in astronomy and the possibility of connecting with extraterrestrial life and I thought that it might work the other way round, if we tried to contact them. I thought that the song being played on the air might be a way of getting through to them. But even if there had been anybody up there listening, they wouldn't have heard because I found out later that AM airwaves diffuse in space too rapidly.\\" Post-release During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Byrds performed the song on the television programs The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, Where the Girls Are, and The David Frost Show among others. Additionally, the song would go on to become a staple of the Byrds' live concert repertoire, until their final disbandment in 1973. The song was also performed live by a reformed line-up of the Byrds featuring McGuinn, Crosby, and Chris Hillman in January 1989. In addition to its appearance on the Fifth Dimension album, \\"Mr. Spaceman\\" also appears on several Byrds' compilations, including The Byrds' Greatest Hits, History of The Byrds, The Original Singles: 1965‚Äì1967, Volume 1, The Byrds, The Very Best of The Byrds, The Essential Byrds, and There Is a Season. Live performances of the song are included on the live portion of the Byrds' (Untitled) album as well as on Live at Royal Albert Hall 1971. \\"Mr. Spaceman\\" was broadcast as a wake-up call to the astronauts aboard the NASA space shuttle mission STS-41-D (the first mission of Space Shuttle Discovery) on September 2, 1984. The song \\"Mr. Spaceman\\" written by Jim McGuinn (a.k.a. Roger McGuinn) should not be confused with the Steve Weber song \\"Mister Spaceman\\", found on the Holy Modal Rounders' self-titled debut album. Cover versions \\"Mr. Spaceman\\" has been covered by a number of artists, including the Flying Burrito Brothers on their 1985 live album, Cabin Fever, Velvet Crush on their 2001 compilation album, A Single Odessey, Limbeck on their 2006 Tour EP, and Miracle Legion on the Byrds' tribute album, Time Between ‚Äì A Tribute to The Byrds, In 1994, Jimmy Buffett, Gonzo, and Rizzo the Rat covered \\"Mr. Spaceman\\" on The Muppets' album Kermit Unpigged. In 1998, Alvin and the Chipmunks covered the song on the album The A-Files: Alien Songs. \\"Mr. Spaceman\\" is also one of the songs featured in the Jukebox musical, Return to the Forbidden Planet.

It originally aired on the UPN network in the United States on April 26, 1999. In the episode, eight-year-old Brendon Small discovers that his mother, Paula, is set to have a date with Brendon's soccer coach, the lazy, profane alcoholic John McGuirk. Brendon resents McGuirk for this and expresses his outrage throughout the episode. The date goes terribly and McGuirk and Paula decide to not pursue a relationship. Meanwhile, Brendon and his friends Melissa and Jason film a new movie about a rogue police officer. The episode used retroscripting, a process by which the actors completely improvised all their dialogue lines, the first time this technique was used for an animated television production. Certain script material, however, was provided by series co-founder Loren Bouchard, who also directed the episode. The pilot also utilized the \\"Squigglevision\\" style of animation which was used to produce the show for the entirety of its first season. In its original broadcast, \\"Get Away From My Mom\\" received a 1.4/2 Nielsen Rating, the lowest UPN had ever received in that time slot. The episode received mixed reviews from television critics, particularly pertaining to its employment of improvisation. Plot After soccer practice, eight-year-old aspiring filmmaker Brendon Small shows his mother Paula a self-made trailer for his upcoming film, The Dark Side of the Law, a crime film about a rogue police detective. Paula expresses indifference to the production. At breakfast the next morning, Paula informs Brendon she plans to go on a date that night with Brendon's soccer coach, John McGuirk, much to Brendon's chagrin. Brendon seeks advice from his friend Melissa and her father Erik, but they are unable to advise him as they are late for a violin recital. When McGuirk shows up at Brendon's house for the date that night, Brendon tries to scare him off by acting as if he is his son, but it proves unsuccessful. During the date, Paula becomes agitated at McGuirk's inappropriate, boring subject matter, and she becomes drunk in order to entertain herself. Meanwhile, Brendon, Melissa, and their friend Jason film a scene from The Dark Side of the Law in Brendon's basement, where Brendon's character is in a French prison, confronted by his mother, played by Melissa. They stop filming when Jason's nose starts running, and he demonstrates how he can move the mucus up and down to their disgust. At soccer practice the next day, Brendon‚Äîstill upset with his mother's decision to date his coach‚Äîis uncooperative and chastises McGuirk for dating his mother, accusing him of desires to engage in a relationship with all the soccer players' mothers. While being driven home by Erik, Brendon asks Erik to fight McGuirk as revenge, but Erik denies his request and suggests he take his mind off the topic by playing a car game. Eventually, Brendon decides to apologize to McGuirk for his behavior, and the two reconcile. Later, McGuirk and Paula decide over the phone to end their relationship, a decision Brendon overhears using three-way calling. At the next soccer game, Brendon's team plays poorly, and an opposing player injures Brendon, which causes McGuirk to yell at the referee. While sitting out, Brendon spots Erik and Paula engaging in meaningless and casual flirtation in the bleachers, which Brendon interprets as another possible relationship. Production alt=A man playing a guitar, while the symbol of his band is viewable behind him. \\"Get Away From My Mom\\" was the first episode of Home Movies, which was created by Brendon Small and Loren Bouchard. The episode, as with the four subsequent episodes, demonstrated a writing style known as \\"retroscripting,\\" in which the cast completely improvised their lines. Main cast members Small, H. Jon Benjamin, Paula Poundstone and Melissa Bardin Galsky wrote the episodes, while Bouchard also contributed to certain dialogue material. The episode marked the first animated television production without a script. Bouchard directed this first episode and the entire series. Along with the rest of the first season, the episode was animated using \\"squigglevision,\\" a technique pioneered by the show's executive producer, Tom Snyder. The animation style consists of eight frames of looped \\"zigzagged\\" lines that stimulate the character's mouth movement. This style was used to produce the series on its incredibly low budget and allow for the actors to improvise. The style was eventually changed during the second season to Flash animation, which was believed to be a more conventional style. To make the young characters sound like children, instead of adults, recordings of the actors' performances were electronically altered. Galsky was cast to play Melissa despite having no prior experience in voice acting. Galsky considers Bouchard the biggest benefactor to her career based on that decision. After recording sessions for \\"Get Away From My Mom\\" concluded, Small (who voices Brendon) and Benjamin (who plays McGuirk) went out to drink beers before going to see a concert. According to Small, the experience contributed to their understanding of the unique dynamic between the characters. \\"Get Away From My Mom\\" is available on the DVD \\"Home Movies: The Complete First Season,\\" which was released on November 16, 2004. A bonus feature on the DVD enables an audio commentary track, recorded by Small, Bouchard, and Benjamin, to play over the episode. Though generally intended to be humorous and entertaining, the track also details actual information on the episode's production. Reception \\"Get Away From My Mom\\" was originally broadcast on April 26, 1999 on UPN at 8 p.m. The episode received a 1.4/2 Nielsen rating, positioning it at 133 in total viewership for 1999's May sweeps. This marked the lowest rated telecast the network had ever aired in its timeslot at the time. The episode received generally mixed reviews from television critics. Writing for The Cincinnati Enquirer, John Kiesewetter criticized the show's use of improvised dialogue: \\"The uneven plot and sophomoric bodily function jokes sound like these people were making it up as they went along. And they were.\\" Rob Owen, television critic for the Post- Gazette, paralleled Kiesewetter and said that the episode was a \\"pitfall\\" of the improvisation process: \\"The half-hour seems like a collection of scenes rather than a cohesive episode.\\" Owen called it \\"so lackadaisical, it's hard to imagine UPN's most recently announced target audience - young males - having any patience for the program. The entertainment value is low\\", but did note that McGuirk's scenes in the episode were \\"the closest to ha-ha funny the show gets.\\" Conversely, John Levesque called the show a \\"keeper\\" in his review for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and applauded the series subtle, improvised style. Chicago Sun-Times journalist Phil Rosenthal commended the episode. In his review, he wrote, \\"Rather than big laughs, it's more likely to elicit the grin of bemused recognition. It's not about sight gags or clever puns. It's not about parodying the sitcom form. This sweet ass series[...]is not always subtle - unless a child showing another how to have fun with a runny nose is intellectual - but it nicely plays off the inherent absurdities and weirdness of everyday modern life.\\" Dennis Landmann of DVD Freak wrote that the episode \\"sets up the tone quite well, for it develops the aspirations of Brendon becoming a filmmaker,\\" and praised the confrontational scenes that occur between McGuirk and Brendon.

The campaign involved several events, and the first of these was the premiere of the documentary about LGBT Christians ‚ÄòFish Cannot Fly‚Äô, attended by nearly 80 people. The movie was followed by debates on faith, religion, Christianity, Protestantism and fundamental churches. As a result of the campaign, the Belarusian party \\"The Greens\\" (BPG) officially announced the establishment of the Commission on the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) rights. The Greens was the first Belarusian party to have such a commission in their structure. The announcement of the LGBT-subdivision establishment in the party was timed to the campaign \\"Month against Homophobia in Belarus\\". The Belarusian online media highly praised the Belarusian LGBT activists work carried out in the period from 17 April to 17 May within the \\"Month against Homophobia in Belarus\\", and called it the second most important cultural project in 2009,–í –ë–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å–∏ –∫–∞–º–ø–∞–Ω–∏—è ¬´–ú–µ—Å—è—Ü –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤ –≥–æ–º–æ—Ñ–æ–±–∏–∏¬ª –Ω–∞–∑–≤–∞–Ω–∞ –æ–¥–Ω–∏–º –∏–∑ –ª—É—á—à–∏—Ö –ø—Ä–æ–µ–∫—Ç–æ–≤ 2009 –≥–æ–¥–∞ which was designed to inform Belarusians about the life and problems of the LGBT community. Day of Silence In April 2009, the human rights activists of the LGBT Human Rights Project \\"GayBelarus\\", the Belarusian Initiative for Sexual and Gender Equality, with the support of the public association \\"Young Social Democrats - Young Gramada\\" held in Minsk a public action Day of Silence, in the form of a \\"silent\\" flashmob. With their mouths taped, the participants of the action handed out leaflets with information about what homophobia is and why society needs to deal with this problem. Not without incident, while handing out the leaflets the flash mob participants were approached by two police officers with a request to show them the flyers. However, looking through the anti-homophobia leaflets for a few minutes, the policemen came to conclusion that the action might be continued but the protesters should peel the tape off their mouths. 5th National Belarusian LGBT Conference On 26 September in Minsk was held the conference \\"LGBT - movement and non-governmental institutions. Prospects of cooperation with the NGO sector and the active civil society to overcome homophobia in Belarus\\". The event was initiated by the LGBT Human Rights Project \\"GayBelarus\\" together with the project \\"GayRussia.Ru\\". The conference was attended by representatives of some political parties, as well as a wide range of NGOs and civil initiatives, including some anarchists. In total, there were about 100 participants from more than 30 organizations to take part in the event. Homophobia in Belarus, ways to overcome the problem, the peculiar features of East European LGBT- movement, male and female activists‚Äô interactions and other issues were raised in the various presentations, projects and reports within the conference. Siarhei Androsenka Among the speakers at the conference were the following participants: President of IDAHO ‚Äì Louis Georges Tin, head of the LGBT Human Rights Project \\"GayBelarus\\" - Siarhei Androsenka, head of the project \\"GayRussiav\\" - Nikolai Alexeyev, head of the European Commission in Belarus - Jean-Eric Holzapfel, deputy chairman of the Belarusian Helsinki Committee - Tatiana Gotsura, a representative of the Viasna Human Rights Centre - Tatiana Revyaka, head of the Core Values Commission of the Belarusian Social Democratic Party Narodnaya Hramada (BSDP NH) - Igor Borisov, head of the \\"Greens\\" - Oleg Novikov, head of the national NGO \\"Vstrecha\\" (\\"Meeting\\") - Oleg Eremin, the First Musical Channel VJ - Katsiaryna Pytleva, head of the portal ¬´Gay.By¬ª - Alexander Polujan. At the end of the conference, the participants were proposed to vote for a resolution demanding that the President and the Government should amend the Belarusian legislation. The resolution pointed out that Belarus decriminalized homosexuality in 1994, while the World Health Organization removed homosexuality from the list of mental illnesses in 1990. The participants called on the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, the Government and the Parliament of Belarus to add the concepts of sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of illegal grounds for discrimination, to make amendments to the criminal law in order to legally prohibit incitement to hatred and hostility on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity, and to equal the human rights of the same-sex and opposite-sex couples. Also, the conference was attended by several observers - diplomats from Sweden, France and Hungary, as well as a representative of the Swedish human rights organization Civil Rights Defenders. Action in defense of Iranian gay convicts sentenced to death On 16 December 2009 in Minsk there was an action organized by the LGBT Human Rights Project \\"GayBelarus\\" in defense of the Iranian gay convicts who were sentenced to death for sodomy. The protest action in the form of picketing took place by the Iranian Embassy and lasted only 15 minutes. Nevertheless, the participants managed to pass their petition directly to the Ambassador of Iran in Belarus.

The recommendations, developed for the authorities of the Republic of Belarus and Belarusian NGOs, were aimed to suggest the measures to be taken in order to reduce the homophobia level in Belarus as well as to increase the efficiency of state guarantees in respect of the rights and freedoms of all the citizens, regardless their sexual orientation and gender identity. Gay-lesbian magazine ‚ÄòGay‚Äô presentation On the night from 27 to 28 February 2010 there was an evening presentation dedicated to the first edition of the new LGBT magazine \\"GAY: GoodAsYou\\" in Belarus. The presentation was held in one of the clubs in Minsk and was attended by more than 200 people. \\"GAY: GoodaAsYou\\" was not the first Belarusian LGBT magazine. It aimed to reveal the entire spectrum of gay people's lives, to show the diversity as well as the richness of the Belarusian human rights and cultural gay and lesbian life. At that time the chief editor of the magazine was one of the \\"GayBelarus\\" activists Sergei Praded. LGBT Human Rights Project \\"GayBelarus\\" activists‚Äô meeting with the BSU students On 9 April 2010 the representatives of the LGBT Human Rights Project \\"GayBelarus\\" and the organizers of the \\"Slavic Gay Pride\\" in Minsk held a meeting with the Belarusian State University students from the Departments of Psychology and Journalism.

The Day of Silence took place simultaneously with the elections to the local councils of the Republic of Belarus, which increased the probability of protesters‚Äô arrests. However, there were no incidents and the participants handed out all the flyers. The whole event lasted 1,5hrs. All along there were no obstacles either from the authorities or any other side. \\"Sexual Revolution in Minsk\\" On 11 October 2010 in Minsk there was held an action, dedicated to the International Coming-Out Day.

Besides, the agenda of the debates included a series of questions about the life of gays in Belarus. Also, stereotypes about gay activists within the gay community, the role of activists for the community, and the work that activist do and should do were discussed. First authorized picket against homophobia On February 14, 2011, a group of activists of the Belarusian LGBT community held the first authorized anti-homophobia rally in Belarus to support LGBT rights. Around ten people gathered near the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Belarus. Due to the cold weather, the event took 10‚Äì15 minutes. The participants were holding posters which said \\"To love a person you want is a human right,\\" \\"Equal rights without a compromise,\\" \\"Homophobia is a disgrace to the country,\\" \\"Belarus without homophobes,\\" etc. The event was scrutinized by the police and journalists. East Bloc Love In March 2011, Logan Mucha, an Australian film director, was shooting a documentary East Bloc Love which featured Human Rights Project \\"GayBelarus\\" and Sergey Yenin, a gay activist. The film premiered in 2011 at the Frameline LGBT Film Festival in San Francisco, and later it was screened at a number of other film festivals such as Movies That Matter, Amnesty International, and it won the nomination \\"Best Documentary\\" at the Merlinka Film Festival [53] in Belgrade. Film screenings in Vitebsk Since April 2011, regular LGBT film screenings in Vitebsk were arranged by a GayBelarus coordinator of the Vitebsk Region[54]. Subsequently, the coordinator was subjected to pressure by the local authorities. He was charged with organizing of the so-called silent protests in Vitebsk, which was one of the reasons why he had to stop his weekly film screenings. Information campaign in support of LGBT On May 17, activists from the LGBT Human Rights Group \\"GayBelarus\\" and the MSA \\"Young social democrats‚ÄîMaladaya Hramada\\" intended to hold an information event where they wanted to disseminate leaflets about legalizing gay love in Belarus. The event was to begin near the House of Officers close to the Executive Office of the President of the Republic of Belarus‚Äîa traditional meeting point for gays and lesbians in Minsk. As the group of young people gathered and went towards the Nezalezhnasti Ave., it was surrounded by the police officers in civilian clothes, special forces were called for who, having arrived 2‚Äì3 minutes later, detained 15 people.–í –ú–∏–Ω—Å–∫–µ –û–ú–û–ù —Ä–∞–∑–æ–≥–Ω–∞–ª –∞–∫—Ü–∏—é –≥–µ–µ–≤ .

GayBelarus Foundation Meeting :(The first attempt to get registered) On October 15, members of the LGBT Human Rights Group \\"GayBelarus\\" held the foundation meeting in Minsk and signed the charter of their human rights organization, chose its chair, counselors, and members of the utilization review committee. Since words \\"Belarus\\" or \\"Belarusian\\" can‚Äôt be used in the name of the organization unless legally endorsed, the name was decided to be \\"Human Rights Centre Alternative Plus\\". In late December, the registration was rejected due to formal reasons.

The action was dedicated to the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. About 10 activists were handing out stickers and information materials against racism, xenophobia and the death penalty. At the end of the sprint flash mob, right before disappearing the participants left two toys and a bag with some glued on stickers against racism, xenophobia and the death penalty. The reason for this rapidity of the action as well as the poor format was the fact that the Minsk local authorities once again banned a peaceful LGBT campaign. The very action was timed to coincide with the European Week against Racism and Xenophobia, as well as the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. In addition to the public action and within the European Week against Racism and Xenophobia, the human rights activists of ‚ÄòGayBelarus‚Äô handed out leaflets in the subway, arranged a film screening and debates on the death penalty. Rainbow column on \\"Free Will Day\\" and the Chernobyl Path On 25 March 2012, 15 human rights activists of ‚ÄòGayBelarus‚Äô appeared with rainbow flags, the world‚Äôs symbol of the movement for the rights of the LGBT community, at the procession of the Belarusian democratic opposition in Minsk, dedicated to the Free Will Day. The organizers did not hamper the LGBT column procession. Later, on 26 April 2012, the activists of the human rights project took part in the annual procession of the Belarusian opposition ‚Äì the Chernobyl Path. The LGBT activists were holding rainbow flags and passing alongside with the rest of the participants. However, there was an incident when a young man tried to pull out two rainbow flags out of the gay activists‚Äô hands. Later on, the Orthodox media tried to blacken the event due to the fact that gay activists took part in the action. The Month Against Homophobia and Transphobia May 2012 was the month against homophobia and transphobia. During the period were held several major events, including the round table ‚ÄòLGBT and Education‚Äô and a number of film screenings. In addition, the project activists pasted up stickers calling for tolerance. Minsk City Executive Committee did not allow conducting any public actions in support of tolerant attitude to the LGBT community. [83] Nevertheless, the human rights activists of ‚ÄòGayBelarus‚Äô together with the Society of Belarusian Students held a public action in Minsk. During the event the participants were handing out cards with information on equality and diversity of Belarusian society. Founding Congress \\"GayBelarus\\" :(second attempt of registration) On 8 December 2012 in Minsk was held the founding congress of the National Youth Public Association ‚ÄòHuman Rights Center ‚ÄòLambda‚Äô. This was the name, under which the human rights project ‚ÄòGayBelarus‚Äô wanted to legalize their activities in 2012. Sergey Androsenko was elected President and Maxim Dmitriev - his deputy. The congress was attended by 72 delegates from all the regions of the Republic of Belarus and Minsk. They adopted the articles of the association and elected its governing bodies. The organization mainly aimed at providing various kinds of legal assistance for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people. Subsequently, an application was filed to the Ministry of Justice with a request to register the organization. Other activities in brief * At the beginning of the year the \\"GayBelarus\\" activists delivered a lecture on the Belarusian LGBT movement to the students-politologists of the Dutch University of Radboud.

Amnesty International called on the Belarusian Government to respect the right for freedom of LGBT associations and give them the opportunity to register the ‚ÄòHuman Rights Center ‚ÄòLambda‚Äô. The numerous facts related to the persecution of LGBT representatives, as well as their organizations and activists, by the authorities were included in the report on the human rights situation in Belarus regarding the rights for freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association. The report was published by Amnesty International in 2013. The cases of persecution and intimidation were also stated by Ian Kelly, the chairman of the U.S. Mission to the OSCE, in his report ‚ÄòStatement of harassment in regards to the LGBT people and political prisoners in Belarus‚Äô to the Permanent Council in Vienna on 14 February 2013. Within the period from January to April 2013 there were 7 police raids committed on the activities of the human rights project ‚ÄòGayBelarus‚Äô and the parties of the LGBT community. The first incident occurred on the night from 11 to 12 January in the Minsk club ‚Äò6_A‚Äô. The police entered the club, blocked the way out and copied the personal data of all the visitors. According to the witnesses, there were about 100 people at the club at the time of the raid. In the night from 12 to 13 January a similar case occurred in the Vitebsk club ‚ÄòXXI Century‚Äô. At around 1 a.m. the police broke into the club and immediately ordered everyone to stand against the walls: the males ‚Äì on one side, the females ‚Äì on the other side. The police officers copied all the personal data of the visitors, asking them for their names, place of residence and employment.

Consequently, the owner of the club ‚Äò6_A‚Äô started having problems with the city authorities, which finally made him hurriedly and unexpectedly close down the club.

Vitaly was persecuted by an organized group of ‚Äòhunters of pedophiles‚Äô called ‚ÄòLeather Microphone‚Äô. Subsequently, two of the hunters were sentenced for insulting and distribution of the victim‚Äôs personal information, two more were announced wanted by the Criminal Investigation Department. \\"GayBelarus\\" together with the other LGBT initiatives in Belarus collectively condemned the statements by the Ambassador of France to Belarus Michel Raineri in which he stated that ‚Äòas a functionary he is for the same- sex marriage, but as a true believer he speaks in favour of the union of a man and a woman.–ü–æ—Å–æ–ª –§—Ä–∞–Ω—Ü–∏–∏ –ú–∏—à–µ–ª—å –†–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∏: ¬´–ú—ã –±—É–¥–µ–º —Ä–∞–¥—ã, –µ—Å–ª–∏ –±–µ–ª–æ—Ä—É—Å—ã –ø—Ä–∏–µ–¥—É—Ç –≤–æ –§—Ä–∞–Ω—Ü–∏—é —Å –¥–µ–Ω—å–≥–∞–º–∏, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –∏—Ö –ø–æ—Ç—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å¬ª Consequently, a joint letter was sent to a number of the government agencies of the French Republic with the request to admit the inadmissibility of such statements from the sidelines of diplomats as this discriminates against LGBT rights. After that, on the initiative of the Ambassador Michel Raineri, a meeting was held in the Embassy of France. The meeting was attended by the representatives of the human rights project ‚ÄòGayBelarus‚Äô Natalia Mankovskaya and the project ‚ÄòGay Alliance of Belarus‚Äô Alexander Poluian. In 2013, the delegation of the human rights project \\"GayBelarus\\" also took part in the \\"KyivPride2013\\".

It is located in Montego Bay, Jamaica with a panoramic view of the coast. Thought to be one of the country's most impressive plantation great houses, it had fallen into ruins by the 1960s, but was then restored. The museum showcases the slave history of the estate and the legend of the White Witch of Rose Hall. Description Rose Hall House, Jamaica The ground plan of Rose Hall Rose Hall is widely regarded to be a visually impressive house and the most famous in Jamaica. It is a mansion in Jamaican Georgian style with a stone base and a plastered upper storey, high on the hillside, with a panorama view over the coast. The architect James Hakewill visited the building and wrote: Rose Hall was restored in the 1960s to its former splendor, with mahogany floors, interior windows and doorways, paneling and wooden ceilings. It is decorated with silk wallpaper printed with palms and birds, ornamented with chandeliers and furnished with mostly European antiques. There is a bar downstairs and a restaurant. History Engraving from James Hakewill's A Picturesque Tour of the island of Jamaica, from drawings made in the years 1820 and 1821 (1825) The land, 290 acres of caneland, was bought by Henry Fanning for ¬£3,000 in 1742. It was previously called \\"True Friendship\\" and had belonged to Richard Lawrence. Henry married Rosa Kelly on July 16th, 1746, but died soon afterwards. His widow inherited the estate and married George Ash, a local plantation owner who realised Fanning's plan to build Rose Hall. It cost ¬£30,000 to build and was lavishly decorated with carved mahogany and stone. However Ash died in 1752. Rosa married for a third time, to Norwood Witter in May 1753, who lived until 20 May, 1765, managing to consume a significant amount of her fortune. In May 1767 she married John Palmer, a widower who owned the adjoining plantation, \\"Palmyra\\". Tomb said to be that of Annie Palmer at Rose Hall Rosa died in 1790, leaving her property to her husband. When Palmer died in 1797, he left the property in trust to his two sons John and James Palmer. However, they both died childless, and in 1818 the two estates were passed down to John Rose Palmer, his grandnephew. John Rose Palmer came to Jamaica from England to claim the estate, and on 28 March 1820 he married Anne Mary Patterson from Lucea, Hanover Parish. John Rose Palmer died in November 1827. Rose Hall estate had about 650 acres divided among sugar cane, grass, and pasture for over 270 head of cattle. About 250 enslaved Africans were housed on Palmyra estate, which comprised about 1,250 acres.Hakewill J. (1825), A Picturesque Tour of the island of Jamaica, from drawings made in the years 1820 and 1821 (1825). Refurbishment Rose Hall before the reconstruction Rose Hall was bought in 1977 by former Miss USA Michele Rollins and her entrepreneur husband John Rollins. They refurbished it at great personal expense and conceptualised a tour and museum that showcase Rose Hall's slave history, antique splendor and original fittings. Rose Hall also offers night tours that focus on the \\"Annie Palmer\\" legend: supposed locations of tunnels, bloodstains, hauntings and murders. Seances are also held on the property in an attempt to conjure Annie's spirit. Legend According to legend, a \\"white witch\\" called \\"Annie Palmer\\" who murdered three husbands haunts the property. An investigation of the legend in 2007 concluded that the story was fictionalized.Jim Stefko, \\"The White Witch of Rose Hall\\", Suite101.com (site blocked) See also * List of plantations in Jamaica * List of plantation great houses in Jamaica ReferencesExternal links * Aerial view * Annie Patterson, the white witch of Rose Hall between Reality and Legend * Official Webpage * Description and photo of the house as a modern tourist site * History of the house and modern tourist site Georgian architecture Great Houses in Jamaica Historic house museums in Jamaica Montego Bay Buildings and structures in Saint James Parish, Jamaica Tourist attractions in Saint James Parish, Jamaica ","title":"Rose Hall, Montego Bay"},{"id":"23779967","text":"Dam√´s () is a village in and the seat of the former Fratar municipality, Fier County, Albania.

It has since been abandoned and destroyed. History Sterlingville was founded in 1854 when two miners named James Sterling and Aaron Davis discovered gold in nearby Sterling Creek. Word leaked out that gold had been found, and within two years Sterlingville was home to over 800 people. Buildings in the town included general stores, a warehouse, boarding houses, a bakery, a casino, a dance hall, saloons, a blacksmith shop, a barber shop, and many houses. At its peak Sterlingville had a population of over 1,500. The Sterlingville School District was created in 1869. In 1877, the newly founded Sterling Mine Company built the Sterling Ditch, diverting water from Little Applegate River for hydraulic mining of gold and chromite. Sterling Mine quickly became the largest hydraulic mine in Oregon, and possibly the entire western United States. As the source of Sterling Ditch was above the mine, it used gravity to propel water through three 5-inch (13 cm) nozzles. Captain A. P. Ankeny, owner of the Sterling Mine Company, collected over $64,000 from gold. The Sterlingville post office was built in 1879, but as the gold ran out, the population of the town declined. In 1883, the post office closed, by 1910, hydraulic mining had stopped, and in 1937, the school district closed down. During the Great Depression, Sterlingville saw a revival of hydraulic mining. The mines operated from 1933 to 1957. The mines devastated the surrounding landscape, washing away nearly all the soil, and moving piles of rocks downstream. After the mines closed, the town was abandoned and destroyed.

The pump was used to deliver basal insulin continuously, and bolus insulin at meal times by pressing the buttons. The Deltec Cozmo used a 300 unit cartridge to store the insulin compared to the 200 unit cartridge of the current Animas Ping. The CozMore is a pump-meter combination consisting of a normal Cozmo insulin pump and a thin black meter that was placed over the back. The two devices connected through infrared signals. The two devices had separate power sources, but the meter could not function on its own as it displayed the information on the screen of the insulin pump. Unlike the Animas Ping which has a locking feature that is undone by pressing both the up and down arrow buttons, the Deltec Cozmo had a number locking feature. The purpose of this feature was somewhat defeated by pump trainers encouraging the use of 14 as the code number. The Deltec Cozmo also used a different scrolling mechanism than the Animas Ping. On the Ping pump holding down the up or down button causes a change in one number then increments by five and on the Ping meter the numbers slowly climb to 5 then abruptly change speed, going from 5 to 110 in the same time it took to go from 0-5; on the Cozmo the scrolling speed slowly accelerated the longer the button was held down. This allowed the pumper to get to high values relatively fast and then still get to the exact value they wanted. While it was still being sold, the Cozmo was marketed heavily towards young people, and included many features that made it easy for teenagers and preteens to use.

The club sometimes traded players with the Reforma Athletic Club a day before a match in order to fill each club's rosters.

The software has been updated a number of times during its life. =DOS Versions= LinSig was first written in the mid-1980s as a DOS-based tool for analysing and optimising single traffic signal junctions. The use of the software spread mainly by word of mouth within the traffic signals profession becoming widely used by signal engineers. The LinSig traffic modelling was based on standard 'Y' value hand calculationsBangladesh Roads and Highways Department  Paragraph 5.30 http://www.rhd.gov.bd/Documents/ExternalPublications/Trl/Calculation%20of%20traffic%20signal%20timings- Webster's%20method%20Note13.pdf http://www.rhd.gov.bd/Documents/ExternalPublications/Trl/Calculation%20of%20traffic%20signal%20timings- Webster's%20method%20Note13.pdf which were widely used at the time for manually calculating traffic signal capacities and delays.

Signal Optimisation LinSig optimises signal timings either to maximise traffic capacity or minimise delay at a junction. Network Modelling LinSig can model and optimise networks of several junctions as well as individual junctions. It is designed to model small groups of junctions in detail rather than larger networks covering entire towns. =Delay Based Assignment= LinSig uses a traditional user equilibrium assignment to assign traffic to routes through the network based on delays calculated by the network model. =Matrix Estimation= LinSig provides a matrix estimation facility to generate a network wide trip matrix from junction turning counts. This uses a combination of traditional entropy- based estimation methods together with customisations targeted at estimating matrices in smaller networks.

It is notable for its denunciation of the extermination of people on the basis of race, and followed the commencement of the Nazi Final Solution program to exterminate the Jews of Europe. The significance of the denunciation is a matter of scholarly debate. Background The 1942 Christmas Address by Pope Pius XII was made shortly after the war had turned decisively against Nazi Germany. Hitler had broken his alliance with Stalin and advanced into the Soviet Union, although his army in Stalingrad had been surrounded, decimated, starved and was about to surrender, precipitating disaster on the Eastern Front. Following decisive victories in North Africa, the Pacific and the air war in Northern Europe, the war had turned in favour of the Allies. From May 1942, the Nazis had commenced their industrialized slaughter of the Jews of Europe ‚Äì the Final Solution.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica : \\"World War Two - German-occupied Europe\\" The brutalization of the Catholic Church in Poland had been underway for three years. The Catholic Church had offered condemnations of Nazi racism since the earliest days of the Nazi movement. The 1942 Christmas address is significant for the light it throws on the ongoing scholarly debate around the war time policies of Pius XII in response to what would later be termed The Holocaust (the systematic murder of Europe's Jews by the Nazis). Pius' cautious approach has been a subject of controversy. According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, his \\"strongest statement against genocide was regarded as inadequate by the Allies, though in Germany he was regarded as an Allied sympathizer who had violated his own policy of neutrality\\".Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: \\"Roman Catholicism - the period of the world wars\\". According to concentration camp prisoner, Father Jean Bernard of Luxembourg, treatment of clergy imprisoned in the Priest Barracks of Dachau Concentration Camp worsened when Pope Pius or the German bishops were critical of Hitler or the Nazis.The Priests of Dachau by Ronald Rychlak; InsideCatholic.com; 8 October 2007. Two Popes served through the Nazi period: Pope Pius XI (1922-1939) and Pope Pius XII (1939-1958). In 1933, Pius signed a Concordat with Germany ‚Äì hoping to protect the rights of Catholics under the Nazi government. The terms of the Treaty were not kept by Hitler. According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: \\"From 1933 to 1936 [Pius XI] wrote several protests against the Third Reich, and his attitude toward fascist Italy changed dramatically after Nazi racial policies were introduced into Italy in 1938.\\" Pius XI delivered three papal encyclicals challenging the new totalitarian creeds from a Catholic perspective: against Italian Fascism Non abbiamo bisogno (1931; \\"We Do Not Need to Acquaint You\\"); against Nazism Mit brennender Sorge (1937; \\"With Deep Anxiety\\") and against atheistic Communism Divini redemptoris (1937; \\"Divine Redeemer\\"). He also challenged the extremist nationalism of the Action Francaise movement and anti-Semitism in the United States.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica : Pius XI Pius XI's Secretary of State, Cardinal Pacelli (future Pius XII), made some 55 protests against Nazi policies, including its \\"ideology of race\\". As Cardinal Pacelli, Pope Pius XII had assisted Pius XI draft the Mit Brennender Sorge encyclical, a powerful critique of Nazi ideology. Pius XI also commissioned an encyclical demonstrating the incompatibility of Catholicism and racism: Humani generis unitas (\\"The Unity of the Human Race\\"). Following his death however, the less confrontational Pius XII did not issue the encyclical, fearing it would antagonize Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany at a time when he hoped to act as an impartial peace broker. With Europe on the brink of war, Pius XI died on 10 February 1939 and Cardinal Pacelli was elected to succeed him as Pope Pius XII. As Vatican Secretary of State, Pacelli had been a critic of Nazism and the Nazi government was exceptional in not sending a representative to his coronation. Pius, a cautious diplomat, pursued the course of diplomacy to attempt to convince European leaders to avoid war.http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20684.pdf Following the outbreak of war, Pius followed Vatican precedent and pursued a policy of \\"impartiality\\". Despite this official policy, Pius passed intelligence to the Allies and made a series of general condemnations of racism and genocide through the course of the war, and chose diplomacy to assist the persecuted during the war. For this he was scorned by Hitler as a \\"Jew lover\\"Vatican hopes secret files exonerate 'Hitler's pope'; Dalya Alberge; The Observer; 9 February 2013 and a blackmailer on his back, whom he believed constricted his ally Mussolini and leaked confidential German correspondence to the world.Hitler's Table Talk 1941-1944: \\"Religion in Eastern Territories\\", Cameron & Stevens, Enigma Books pp. 269, 671 Largely posthumously (and controversially), Pius has been criticized for not \\"doing enough\\" to prevent the Holocaust ‚Äì and by others of being \\"silent\\" in the face of it. According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, depictions of the Pope as anti-Semitic or indifferent to the Nazi Holocaust lack \\"credible substantiation\\". Upon the death of Pius XII in 1958, he was praised by world leaders for his wartime leadership, with the Israeli Foreign Minister Golda Meir saying: \\"When fearful martyrdom came to our people in the decade of Nazi terror, the voice of the Pope was raised for the victims. The life of our times was enriched by a voice speaking out on the great moral truths above the tumult of daily conflict. We mourn a great servant of peace.\\"http://www.britannica.com/holocaust/article-236599 One scholarly critic of the legacy of Pius XII has been Michael Phayer (author of The Church and the Holocaust, 1930‚Äì1965 (2000)). He has written that the Catholic Church possessed a specific knowledge of the Holocaust that rivaled that of the Allied governments.Phayer, 2008, pp. 44-45. The Vatican possessed information on the systematic nature of deportations and atrocities, compiled from its own diplomatic corps in Eastern Europe, from Catholic bishops in Germany, the Netherlands, and Eastern Europe, from ordinary Catholics, priests, and laity, from the Polish government-in-exile, the foreign diplomats to the Holy See, and various Jews and Jewish organizations. A variety of historians have comprehensively examined the data received by the Vatican, which \\"covered not just the activity of mobile killing squads but every aspect of the Nazis' murdering process\\". However, according to Phayer, until 1942, Cardinal Secretary of State Luigi Maglione had repeatedly and publicly stated that the Vatican was \\"unable to confirm atrocity reports\\".Phayer, 2008, p. 46. Phayer wrote: \\"regarding Maglione's oft-repeated rejoinder to the effect that something could not be confirmed, he never took steps to confirm the many reports of atrocities that flowed to his office. Had Pope Pius wished to do so, he could have assembled a comprehensive picture of the genocidal crimes of the Nazis.\\"Phayer, 2008, p. 47. Messages to the effect that the pope was losing his \\"moral authority\\" due to the failure to condemn Nazi atrocities poured in from diplomats accredited to the Vatican from the United States, Great Britain, Switzerland, Brazil, Uruguay, Peru, Cuba, Belgium, and Poland.Phayer, 2008, pp. 48-49. Moreover, the Allies condemned the genocide of the Jews on 17 December 1942 in the Joint Declaration by Members of the United Nations, which ‚Äì according to Phayer ‚Äì \\"must have sent the Holy See scurrying to play catch-up\\".Phayer, 2008, p. 50. Pius XII refused to endorse the Joint Declaration, as urged by Harold Tittmann, his US ambassador, and indeed, his own speech would be \\"not as bluntly stated as the United Nations' declaration earlier that month\\".Phayer, 2008, pp. 51, 53. A defender of Pius, the eminent historian of the Holocaust, Martin Gilbert portrays Vatican policy in the lead up to the 1942 Christmas message with a very different emphasis: \\"In his first encyclical as Pope, Pius XII specifically rejected Nazism and expressly mentioned the Jews, noting that in the Catholic Church there is \\"neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision.\\"Galatians 3,28. The head of the Gestapo, Heinrich Mueller, commented that the encyclical was \\"directed exclusively against Germany.\\" So outspoken was it that the Royal Air Force and the French air force dropped 88,000 copies of it over Germany. One strong piece of evidence that Dalin produces against the concept of \\"Hitler's Pope\\" is the audience granted by Pius XII in March 1940 to the German Foreign Minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, the only senior Nazi official to visit the Vatican during his papacy. After Ribbentrop rebuked the Pope for \\"siding\\" with the Allies, the Pope responded by reading from a long list of German atrocities and religious persecution against Christians and Jews, in Germany and in Poland which Germany had occupied six months earlier. The New York Times, under the headline \\"JEWS' RIGHTS DEFENDED,\\" wrote on 14 March 1940: \\"The Pontiff, in the burning words he spoke to Herr Ribbentrop about religious persecution, also came to the defense of the Jews in Germany and Poland.\\"Hitler's Pope? by Martin Gilbert; The American Spectator; 18.8.06 Content The 1942 Christmas address was 26 pages and over 5000 words long and took more than 45 minutes to deliver. The majority of the speech spoke generally about human rights and civil society. According to Rittner and Roth, \\"always one to choose words carefully, Pius wrote several drafts before he had crafted exactly what he wanted to say on that particular Christmas Eve\\".Rittner and Roth, 2002, p. 3. Phayer wrote that the speech was \\"crafted to fit the circumstances as he saw them ‚Äì that is to say, he addressed principles and omitted particulars\\".Phayer, 2008, p. 53. Speaking on the 50th anniversary of Pius' death in 2008, the German Pope Benedict XVI recalled that the Pope's voice had been \\"broken by emotion\\" as he \\"deplored the situation\\" with a \\"clear reference to the deportation and extermination of the Jews.\\"Vatican Archive - Homily by Pope Benedict XVI; 9 October 2008 The Pope addressed the issues of racial persecutions in the following terms: > Humanity owes this vow to those hundreds of thousands who, without any fault > on their part, sometimes only because of their nationality or race, have > been consigned to death or to a slow decline [also translated: \\"marked down > for death or gradual extinction\\"]. Rittner and Roth described these as the \\"pivotal words that remain one of the key flashpoints in the Holocaust-related controversy that continues to swirl around him\\", and came near the end of the speech. Phayer, Rittner and Roth see it as significant that Pius XII did not address the perpetrators or victims by name.Phayer, 2008, pp. 52-53. Nor did he mention Jews or antisemitism.  Contemporary reception  The immediate reaction to the speech was generally positive, with the exception of the Nazis and Jewish victims in Poland.Phayer, 2008, p. 56. Diplomatic criticism of the Vatican's \\"moral authority\\" essentially ceased for an entire year, until the deportations of the Italian Jews began in 1943.Phayer, 2008, pp. 56-57. A New York Times editorial called Pius XII a \\"lonely voice crying out of the silence of a continent\\".New York Times. 25 December 1942. \\"The Pope's Verdict.\\" p. 16. Phayer's survey of global news sources notes that every paper that covered the speech did so in a positive light, although none of them considered it front-page news.Phayer, 2008, p. 58. Tittmann pressured Pius XII in their diplomatic meetings to go further in his public statements, but privately wired the State Department that \\"taken as a whole, the message may be regarded as an arraignment of totalitarianism. Furthermore, the reference to the persecution of the Jews and mass deportations is unmistakeable.\\"Phayer, 2008, p. 57. The speech elicited the strongest reaction in the Dutch Catholic Church.Phayer, 2008, p. 59. Archbishop of Utrecht, Johannes de Jong, saw the address as a signal for Catholics to publicly confront Nazism.Phayer, 2008, p. 60. A later pastoral letter from the Dutch bishops claimed to be \\"following a path indicated by our Holy Father, the Pope\\" and quoted the address: \\"The Church would be untrue to herself, ceasing to be a mother, if she turned a deaf ear to children's anguished cries.\\" However, unlike the Christmas address, the Dutch letter went farther and \\"named names\\". Others were more guarded in their reactions. Bishop Konrad von Preysing of Berlin agreed that the address referred to Jews, but considered it not specific enough. Catholic Poles believed that the address referred to them alone and wished that the pope had identified the Germans as the perpetrators.Phayer, 2008, pp. 58-59. The Polish government-in-exile in London remained dissatisfied with the address, wishing for a \\"more trenchant papal condemnation\\" that named the perpetrators.Phayer, 2008, p. 63. The German government expressed displeasure at the Christmas address and boycotted the pope's Christmas eve liturgy. According to Pinchas Lapide's Three Popes and the Jews, on 27 December 1942 the Prague department of the RSHA reported the following about the Christmas broadcast, that \\"the Pope has repudiated the National-Socialist New European Order. ...He is virtually accusing the German people of injustice toward the Jews and makes himself the mouthpiece of the Jewish war criminals.\\"Lapide, 1980, p. 137. However, Phayer claims he attempted to assuage the German ambassador, Diego von Bergen, by pulling him aside and assuring him that his remarks were intended for the Soviets and Stalin rather than the Germans. Phayer argues that contemporaries and scholars have viewed the speech differently because \\"we know that the pope would not take up the matter again, but contemporaries did not know that this would be the case. In fact, to assert that Pope Pius himself intended this to be his one and only statement is incorrect.\\" Scholarly interpretation According to Rittner and Roth, the speech remains a \\"lightning rod in debates about Pius XII and the Holocaust\\", and its interpretation remains \\"unsettled and unsettling\\".Rittner and Roth, 2002, p. 4. To the eminent Holocaust historian, Sir Martin Gilbert, the Reich Security Main Office calling Pius a \\"mouthpiece\\" of the Jews in response to his Christmas address, is clear evidence that Pius was one who raised his voice for the victims of Nazi terror.Hitler's Pope? by Martin Gilbert; The American Spectator; 18.8.06 This is a view shared by scholars such as David Dalin (author of The Myth of Hitler's Pope: How Pope Pius XII Rescued Jews From the Nazis). Phayer agrees that the 1942 speech did denounce genocide, but argues that \\"it is still not clear whose genocide or which genocide he was referring to, and we can do no more than speculate as to why he spoke out\\".Phayer, 2008, p. xii. Phayer states that \\"although the word genocide would not be coined until 1944, Pius XII denounced what we now commonly understand as genocide\\". In 2000, Phayer wrote that \\"Pope Pius's radio talk contained twenty-seven words about the Holocaust out of twenty-six pages of text\\".Phayer, 2000, p. 49. While Phayer's views of the speech changed between 2000 and 2008 (\\"Pius did speak out\\"), his dismal assessment of the \\"Vatican's essential passivity in collecting and disseminating genocide information\\" did not.Phayer, 2008, p. 42.Phayer, 2008, p. 252. Phayer states that his change of views came after he was invited by Michael Marrus to participate in a University of Toronto conference about the Holocaust and the Netherlands. Phayer cites the address as evidence of the \\"adaptability rather than uniform rigidity at the Vatican in the middle of the Holocaust years. The Holy See was in search of a new path for papal policy\\".Phayer, 2008, p. 43. He argues that historians (himself included) have been \\"too dismissive of the 1942 address\\" although he agrees that \\"Pius never spoke out again\\".

The screenplay concerns three men who have their lives turned over by the existence of a tattooed Ouija Board, which opens the gateways to other dimensions. Hagen keeps the corpse of his lover in his house, hoping that one day she will come back from the dead as promised. When he meets a man named Travis, he learns that maybe he could venture into hell and bring her back from the dead himself. Plot Travis cares for his mentally disabled younger brother and works as a torturer for hire. He is also addicted to heroin; it is ketamine, however, that catapults him into the realm of a black-eyed demon called Morbius. Morbius informs Travis that his brother has been taken by another demonic troublemaker called Mister Skinny. Mister Skinny appears as a diaper-wearing fat caucasian butcher in a pig mask who first entices the boy to eviscerate his slumbering baby-sitter. If Travis helps Morbius exact vengeance then Morbius will allegedly help Travis find his dead brother. Morbius instructs Travis to find Hagen and extract an agreement to use him as a gateway to Hell. Travis does this by assuring the desperate Hagen that the process will allow Hagen to enter the next realm and possibly retrieve the soul of his decomposing lover. Travis proceeds to carve demonic symbols into Hagen's back and sends him straight into Hell, where he is gruesomely mutilated by a monstrous eyeless beast before ever setting out in search of his lover. Travis follows in search of his own brother and is disabled and dragged into the darkness by the hideous beast. Morbius is then shown as being the beast and being controlled by another entity who looks like a gray-skinned adult man in a gas mask. It is then discovered that Morbius was a mute who worked as a bartender and dabbled in the occult. Morbius' girlfriend Elizabeth ultimately grew bored with her relationship, working with her lover Hagen to poison Morbius. When Morbius fails to expire on schedule, however, Hagen inadvertently becomes a murderer by killing the mute with a folding chair after Morbius manages to choke the life out of his treacherous girlfriend. Morbius abruptly finds himself in Hell and facing the gas-masked entity, who reveals himself to be a visage of Elizabeth's unborn son. Morbius pleads for revenge and the entity agrees on the condition that Morbius will then belong to the entity, as the act of revenge will ensure that Morbius will be lost to the darkness forever. Morbius agrees, then collapses to the floor, where he slowly is shown becoming his demonic form, with paper white skin and hair, and solid black eyes. He then continues to transform further until eventual becoming the large mutilated demon, who was seen exacting its revenge against Hagen, and dragging Travis away.

When patterns of use and delineation of program can no longer be mapped, how should the ‚Äòsymbol‚Äô and ‚Äòshelter‚Äô of Architecture engage each other to redefine functionalism? Enveloping such spaces with an electronic ‚Äòsign‚Äô that simply charts these shifting uses, assuming such a charting could be performed cogently, demotes architecture to a mimetic device, which is ultimately unfulfilling in its capacity as an agent for social commentary. While technology has significantly affected our approach to building surfaces, we have yet to study its ramifications on traditional architectural elements and how the two may merge to update our design vocabulary. The curtain wall system is one element explored in our study ‚Äì generally understood as an amalgamation of the age-old elements of wall and window. However, could it function flexibly both as a component of the shed and its symbol, to negotiate the tenuous private/public boundary? In an era easily seduced by de(con)structive forms and superficial takes on materials and textures, we propose using new communication and engineering technologies to initiate an evolved architectural language ‚Äì one through which buildings can react to shifting paradigms in contemporary ‚Äòcontext‚Äô to better perform their dual function of ‚Äòsymbol‚Äô and ‚Äòshelter.‚Äô\\"Song, Steven Phillip and Sun-Young Park, ‚ÄúShifting Paradigms: Renovating the Decorated Shed,‚Äù The International Journal of the Humanities, Volume 5, Issue 4, pp.77-98 In July 2007, the article was presented at The 5th International Conference on New Directions in the Humanities held at The American University of Paris.

While the Lutheran Confessions specifically did not define a canon, it is widely regarded as the canon of the Lutheran Church. It differs from the 1546 Roman Catholic canon of the Council of Trent in that it rejects the deuterocanonical books and questions the seven New Testament books, called \\"Luther's Antilegomena\\", four of which are still ordered last in German-language Luther Bibles to this day. note order: ‚Ä¶Hebr√§er, Jakobus, Judas, Offenbarung Deuterocanonical books Luther included the deuterocanonical books in his translation of the German Bible, but he did relocate them to after the Old Testament, calling them \\"Apocrypha, that are books which are not considered equal to the Holy Scriptures, but are useful and good to read.\\"Kitto, John (Editor), (1845). A Cyclopedia of Biblical Literature, Vol 1, (p556). Mark H Newman, NY He also considered the relocation of the Book of Esther from the canon to the Apocrypha, because without the deuterocanonical additions to the Book of Esther, the text of Esther never mentions God. Hebrews, James, Jude and Revelation Some Catholic sources state and certain historians contend that until the definition of the Council of Trent issued on April 8, 1546, the Roman Catholic Church had not yet dogmatically defined the contents of the biblical canon for Catholics and thus settled the matter. though in the 4th century the Council of Rome had outlined the books which now appear in the Catholic Canon, Luther considered Hebrews, James, Jude, and the Revelation to be \\"disputed books\\", which he included in his translation but placed separately at the end in his New Testament published in 1522. This group of books begins with the book of Hebrews, and in its preface Luther states, \\"Up to this point we have had to do with the true and certain chief books of the New Testament. The four which follow have from ancient times had a different reputation.\\" Some opine that Luther's low view of these books was due more to his theological reservations than to any historical basis regarding them. In his book Basic Theology, Charles Caldwell Ryrie countered the claim that Luther rejected the Book of James as being non- canonical. In his preface to the New Testament, Luther ascribed to several books of the New Testament different degrees of doctrinal value: Thus Luther was comparing (in his opinion) doctrinal value, not canonical validity. However, Ryrie's theory is countered by other biblical scholars, including William Barclay, who note that Luther stated plainly, if not bluntly: \\"I think highly of the epistle of James, and regard it as valuable although it was rejected in early days. It does not expound human doctrines, but lays much emphasis on God's law. ‚Ä¶I do not hold it to be of apostolic authorship.\\"Martin Luther, as quoted by William Barclay, The Daily Study Bible. The Letters of James and Peter (1976), revised edition, Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox Press, p. 7. Sola fide doctrine In The Protestant Spirit of Luther‚Äôs Version, Philip Schaff asserts that: Martin Luther's description of the Epistle of James changes. In some cases, Luther argues that it was not written by an apostle; but in other cases, he describes James as the work of an apostle.Die deutsche Bibel 41:578-90 He even cites it as authoritative teaching from GodLuther's Large Catechism, IV 122-24 and describes James as \\"a good book, because it sets up no doctrines of men but vigorously promulgates the law of God.\\"Luther's Works (American Edition) 35:395 Lutherans hold that the Epistle is rightly part of the New Testament, citing its authority in the Book of Concord,The Lutheran Study Bible, Concordia Publishing House, 2009, p2132 however it remains part of the Lutheran antilegomena. Lutheran teachings resolve James' and Paul's verbal conflict regarding faith and works in alternate ways from the Catholics and Orthodox: Similar canons of the time In his book Canon of the New Testament, Bruce Metzger notes that in 1596 Jacob Lucius published a Bible at Hamburg which labeled as \\"Apocrypha\\" Luther's four Antilegomena: Hebrews, James, Jude and Revelation; Lucius explained this category of \\"Apocrypha\\" as 'That is, books that are not held equal to the other holy Scripture'. David Wolder, the pastor of Hamburg's Church of St. Peter, published in the same year a triglot Bible which labeled them as \\"non canonical\\". J. Vogt published a Bible at Goslar in 1614 similar to Lucius'. In Sweden, Gustavus Adolphus published in 1618 the Gustavus Adolphus Bible with those four books labeled as \\"Apocr(yphal) New Testament.\\" Metzger considers thoses decisions a \\"startling deviation among Lutheran editions of the Scriptures\\" Protestant laity and clergy There is some evidence that the first decision to omit these books entirely from the Bible was made by Protestant laity rather than clergy. Bibles dating from shortly after the Reformation have been found whose tables of contents included the entire Roman Catholic canon, but which did not actually contain the disputed books, leading some historians to think that the workers at the printing presses took it upon themselves to omit them. However, Anglican and Lutheran Bibles usually still contained these books until the 20th century, while Calvinist Bibles did not. Several reasons are proposed for the omission of these books from the canon. One is the support for Catholic doctrines such as Purgatory and Prayer for the dead found in 2 Maccabees. Another is that the Westminster Confession of Faith of 1646, during the English Civil War, actually excluded them from the canon. Luther himself said he was following Jerome's teaching about the Veritas Hebraica. Modern Evangelical use Evangelicals tend not to accept the Septuagint as the inspired Hebrew Bible, though many of them recognize its wide use by Greek-speaking Jews in the first century. Many modern Protestants point to four \\"Criteria for Canonicity\\" to justify the books that have been included in the Old and New Testament, which are judged to have satisfied the following: #Apostolic Origin ‚Äì attributed to and based on the preaching/teaching of the first-generation apostles (or their close companions). #Universal Acceptance ‚Äì acknowledged by all major Christian communities in the ancient world (by the end of the fourth century). #Liturgical Use ‚Äì read publicly when early Christian communities gathered for the Lord's Supper (their weekly worship services). #Consistent Message ‚Äì containing a theological outlook similar or complementary to other accepted Christian writings.

The boathouse is a two-story frame structure, clad in clapboard, on concrete piers. Between 1935 and 1940, to save the boathouse from demolition when the Spaulding estate was acquired in order to become Beaver Island State Park, neighboring property owner Frank St. John Sidway, a grandson of Spaulding, moved it about 270 feet northwest to his land.

Although its name, the Communist Party of Western Belarus, could suggest a desire for independence of Belarus, wrote historian Sergiusz ≈Åukasiewicz, in reality the party advocated transfer of eastern provinces of Poland to the Soviet Union, which constituted high treason.

The party worked undercover; in 1925-1927 it masked its illegal activities under the legal Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union in Poland. It received support from the Soviet Union with leadership brought in secretly from across the border (see Vera Kharuzhaya). In 1938, following a decision by the Comintern on the orders of Joseph Stalin, the KPZB along with the Communist Party of Poland and the Communist Party of Western Ukraine were delegalized by the USSR under the charge of affiliation with the Polish bourgeoisie. Following the Soviet invasion of Poland and the annexation of Western Belarus to the Soviet Union in 1939, many former members of the KPZB were repressed, others joined the Communist Party of Byelorussia, the East Belarusian branch of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Biography Stover was born in Riegelsville, Pennsylvania, on July 14, 1861. He attended Lafayette College and graduated in 1881. He studied to become a Presbyterian minister at the Union Theological Seminary and graduated in 1884. He also took classes at the University of Berlin, before moving to Manhattan's Lower East Side. In 1886, Stover founded the Neighborhood Guild on Forsyth Street, the first settlement house in the United States. In 1898, he and Lillian Wald, director of the nearby Henry Street Settlement, founded the Outdoor Recreation League (ORL), whose mission was to provide play spaces and organize games for the children of the densely populated Lower East Side. The ORL opened nine privately sponsored playgrounds and advocated that the City itself build and operate playgrounds. In 1902 the City assumed the operation of the ORL playgrounds, and in 1903 opened what is presumed to be the first municipally built playground in the nation, Seward Park in Manhattan's Lower East Side; the ORL had opened an outdoor gymnasium there in May 1899, on city-owned land. In January 1910, Stover was named parks commissioner for Manhattan by New York City's newly-elected mayor, William Jay Gaynor. Stover's tenure was controversial; in July 1911 The New York Times reported that he was being asked to hand in his resignation. He did not resign and was not fired; in August 1911 he announced major plans were underway for Central Park and Riverside Drive Park. In April 1913 Stover said \\"I do not believe in the policy that the parks are merely places people to walk through and look at the trees and gaze at the landscape from a distance, nor do I believe that any one should be permitted to destroy anything, but I take the position that certain parks of the asphalt and the lawns should be open most liberally to the young people for amusement, proper athletics, and recreation, under proper circumstances.\\" Disappearance and reappearance In October 1913, Stover told his staff and coworkers that he was going out for lunch then he disappeared. In mid-November he was erroneously thought to have died in Delaware when a body resembling him was found. A week later, he was seen in Washington, D.C., by a former city official. In late November, a nationwide search began, which included sending a short film clip to 10,000 moving- picture places across the United States. Shortly thereafter, Stover mailed his letter of resignation from Cincinnati, and Ardolph Loges Kline, the Mayor of New York City, replaced Stover with Louis F. La Roche, Stover's deputy. On January 28, 1914, Stover returned to the University Settlement House. Later life and death Stover spent the rest of his life developing a summer camp at Beacon, New York, operated by the University Settlement House. He died at the University Settlement House on April 24, 1929, at the age of 67, leaving an estate valued at only $500.

The right-hand column notes whether the verb is weak or strong and whether it belongs to a subclass, and links to descriptions elsewhere. Information about the development of these verbs generally can be found at English irregular verbs; details of the etymology and usage of specific verbs can be found by consulting Wiktionary. In some cases, there are two or more possibilities for a given form. In the table, the preferred or more common usage is generally listed first, though for some words the usage is nearly equal for the two choices. Sometimes the usage depends on the dialect. In many cases, such as spell (spelt vs. spelled), learn (learnt vs. learned), and spill (spilt vs. spilled), American English normally uses the regular form, while British English tends to favor the irregular. In other cases, such as dive (dived vs. dove) and sneak (sneaked vs. snuck), the opposite is true. Australian, New Zealand and South African English tend to follow the British practice, while Canadian English often sides with the American usage. It is also worth noting that the irregular form tends to indicate duration, whereas the regular form often describes a short- term action (The fire burned for weeks. vs. He burnt his finger.), and in American English, the regular form is associated with the literal sense of a verb, while the irregular form with a figurative one. The preterite and past participle forms of irregular verbs follow certain patterns. These include ending in -t (e.g. build, bend, send), stem changes (whether it is a vowel, such as in sit, win or hold, or a consonant, such as in teach and seek, that changes), or adding the [n] suffix to the past participle form (e.g. drive, show, rise). English irregular verbs are now a closed group, which means that newly formed verbs are always regular and do not adopt any of the irregular patterns. This list only contains verb forms which are listed in the major dictionaries as being standard usage in modern English. There are also many thousands of archaic, non-standard and dialect variants. Modern English still has remnants of formerly irregular verbs in other parts of speech. Most obviously, adjectives like clean-shaven, beholden, or forlorn fossilize what are originally the past participles of the verbs shave and behold, and Old English forleosan. However, forleosan has fallen out of use and shave is now regular, so these verbs are not listed, and behold, while still irregular, can no longer be listed this participle form. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" !

Life James Joseph Thomas was born March 26, 1946 in Spokane, Washington. He majored in mathematics at Eastern Washington University, and received a master's degree from Washington State University in computer science. His professional career started at General Motors, where he worked in the area of computer-aided graphics and design soon after graduate school in early 1970s. He later returned to his home state to join the Pacific Northwest Laboratory (later renamed Pacific Northwest National Laboratory) as a computer scientist in 1976. He rose through the ranks from senior scientist, staff scientist, chief scientist, to laboratory fellow. In the 1980s, he was a member of the founding team who conceptualized and developed the core concepts for what is today‚Äôs William R. Wiley Environmental and Molecular Sciences Laboratory, a DOE scientific user facility located at PNNL. In the early 1990s, to address the problem of information overload, Thomas headed a team of information technology researchers to develop the SPIRE document Visualization (computer graphics) visualization and analytics system. The successor to this system, IN-SPIRE, is still in use today. In the early 2000s, Thomas led and coordinated a team to formally define a new research area, visual analytics. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) established the National Visualization and Analytics Center (NVAC) at PNNL in 2004, naming Thomas as its founding director. On July 31, 2009, Thomas retired from his position at PNNL after 33 years. He died on August 6, 2010. Professional Societies Thomas organized the SIGGRAPH conference in 1987, founded and organized the first ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST) gathering in 1989, chaired ACM SIGGRAPH from 1989 to 1992, served as editor-in-chief of IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications from 2002 to 2006. He chaired the IEEE Visualization conference in 2003. He helped found the IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST) Symposium that began in 2006. Thomas has also served on industry, government, and international advisory boards.

Its history exemplifies the single Battle Honour of the Royal Artillery - \\"Ubique\\" (Everywhere), serving in the major battles of both world wars. In more recent times Battery members have seen active service in Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan.  Artillery Volunteers 1859-1908 In 1859 the Volunteer Force was created as a result of rising tensions on the European continent. An appeal was made to citizens to form Artillery Volunteer Corps (AVCs) in maritime towns. In the County of Durham this appeal resulted in the formation of four Corps in 1860:Beckett, Appendix VIII. * 1st Durham AVC (Sunderland) * 2nd (Seaham) Durham Artillery Volunteer Corps (Seaham) * 3rd Durham AVC (South Shields) * 4th Durham AVC (Hartlepool) Some of the batteries within the 1st and 3rd Corps were part of the Northumberland Artillery Volunteers.Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 59-60. In 1893 the War Office Mobilisation Scheme had allocated the 3rd Durham Artillery Volunteers to the Tyne fixed defences.Mobilization Tables for Home Defence, List of Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteer Units, HMSO, London, 1893 In 1899, the 3rd Durham Volunteer Artillery were retitled the 3rd Durham Royal Garrison Artillery (Volunteers). Territorial Army Territorial shoulder title worn by the Northumbrian (County of Durham) Brigades RFA. On the formation of the Territorial Force in 1908, the 3rd Durham RGA re-roled as Royal Field Artillery and provided the 4th Durham (Howitzer) Battery and 4th Northumbrian Ammunition Column of the 4th Northumbrian (County of Durham) Howitzer Brigade RFA (T).Litchfield, pp. 55‚Äì6.  First World War  The Brigade mobilised in August 1914 and deployed to France in April 1915. In early May, the Brigade were the first Territorial field gunners to engage in the Ypres fighting in the Second Battle of Ypres. A reorganisation of Field brigades in 1916 saw the 4th Durham Battery transferred to 250 (Northumbrian Brigade) as D/250 Battery, the 5th Durhams going to 251 Brigade, D/251 Battery. These units would go on to take part in the Battles of the Somme, Arras and Passchendaele, before the final battles of 1918.  Inter-War  On the re-forming of the Territorial Army in 1921, the brigade became the 3rd (Northumbrian) Field Brigade RA (TA), which was then re-designated as the 74th Field Brigade RA (TA). A re- organisation of Artillery Field Brigades in 1938 resulted in the formation of the 74th (Northumbrian) Field Regiment RA (TA) together with a duplicate unit, 125th (Northumbrian) Field Regiment RA (TA).  Second World War  The 74th Regiment mobilised as divisional Artillery within the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, supporting 151st Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom), The Durham Light Infantry Brigade, with whom it served from 1939 to 1944. The Regiment deployed to France in 1940 as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). It returned to the UK in the Dunkirk evacuation.Dildy, p.22 In 1941 it embarked with the 8th Army for the Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre. Initially the Regiment took part in the Jock column actions to harass the enemy. Supporting 151 (DLI) Brigade, it was engaged in the Battle of Gazala, breaking out through Mersa Matruh to avoid capture, (although suffering many casualties). Following re-fitting and re-equipment, the Regiment was engaged in the Second Battle of El Alamein, followed by the assault on the Mareth Line. Joining the Italian Campaign, it landed in the Allied invasion of Sicily where it was engaged in the battle of Primosole Bridge (Operation Fustian) and the barrage across the Straits of Messina as part of the invasion of Italy. The Regiments' next major action was D-Day and the Invasion of Normandy, landing on Gold Beach with the 50th Northumbrian (Infantry) Division. It was subsequently involved in the breakout from Normandy in Operation Perch. Later service through Northwest Europe saw the Regiment involved in the liberation of Brussels and the battle of the Gheil bridgehead on the Albert Canal. In September 1944 it formed part of Operation Market Garden. When the rest of the 50th Division returned to England in November, 74 Regiment was attached to 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, being engaged on the Grebbe line. Following the German surrender in May 1945, the Regiment remained in the Army of Occupation, returning to South Shields in 1946. 74 (Northumbrian) Field Regiment fought with distinction in some of the most decisive battles of the Second World War, winning three DSOs, seven MCs and eight MMs. 125 (Northumbrian) Field Regiment re-roled as 125 Anti-Tank Regiment in 1940. It deployed to the Far East and was captured in 1942. Many of the Regiment became Prisoners of War.  1947-1967  In 1947 the Territorial Army was reconstituted, 74 Regiment was re-formed as 274 (Northumbrian) Field Regiment RA (TA), with 125 Regiment converted to 325 (Durham) LAA (Light Anti-Aircraft) Regiment RA (TA). Following subsequent amalgamations, 325 Regiment was absorbed by 463 (Durham Light Infantry) Light Air Defence Regiment RA (TA). On the disbandment of Anti-Aircraft Command in 1955, 274 Regiment absorbed 487 HAA (Heavy Anti-Aircraft) Regiment RA (Durham) (TA) and 377 (Durham) Observation Regiment RA (TA).  101 (Northumbrian) Regiment RA (V)  In 1967 the TA became the Territorial Army and Volunteer Reserve (TAVR). As part of this re-structuring, 101 (Northumbrian) Medium Regiment RA (V) was formed. 205 Medium Battery was constituted from 274 Field and 463 LAA Regiments. In 1974 the honour title 3rd Durham Volunteer Artillery was adopted by the Battery. Initially equipped with the 5.5 inch gun, the Battery converted to the 105mm Light Gun in 1980 and to FH-70 in 1991. The Battery was the last to fire 101 Regiment's guns during the prestigious Queens Cup which it won for the second year running. The following year, in 1997, 205 Battery converted to a missile Battery equipped with M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System and became the first TA Battery to fire that weapon system.

Early life and education He was born in Manchester, Connecticut to Chester and Mary Smith Lyman. Chester is the descendant of Richard Lyman, a settler who arrived in America in 1631. Chester's early education was in a country school, but at an early age he showed a strong interest in astronomy and the sciences. By 1833 he had gained admittance to Yale, and graduated in 1837. In his junior year he became editor of the Yale Literary Magazine and he was a member of Skull and Bones. \\"This list is compiled from material from the Order of Skull and Bones membership books at Sterling Library, Yale University and other public records.

The last year the members were published in the Yale Banner is 1969.\\" He served for two years as Superintendent of Ellington School, then studied theology at the Union and Yale seminaries. For health reasons he then began to travel. In 1846 he sailed to Hawaii and remained for a year. While in Hawaii, he visited missionaries, including his distant cousin David Belden Lyman. In 1847 he sailed to California. There he became a surveyor, mapping ranches and towns. For a few months he joined in the California Gold Rush, then returned to his surveying work. In 1850 he was married to Delia W. Wood, and settled in New Haven. The couple would have six children, with four surviving to adulthood. Career He became a professor of Industrial Mechanics and Physics at Yale's Sheffield Scientific School, and was considered an eminent scholar. He invented the combined transit instrument and zenith telescope that was used to determine latitude, including that of Hawaii. He was on the board of managers for the Yale Observatory, and in December 1866 he was the first to observe the delicate ring of light surrounding Venus when the planet is in inferior conjunction. This observation helped confirm the presence of an atmosphere around the planet. He patented a design for a wave machine in 1867. In 1871 he became a professor of astronomy and physics at the same institution, then exclusively of astronomy in 1884 as his health began to fail. He retired as professor emeritus in 1889. He became the director of the Yale Observatory and held that post until his death. He died in 1890 as the result of a stroke, which had kept him home-bound for the last two years of his life. Chester Lyman was a member of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences and an honorary member of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He served as president of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences for 20 years. His son, Chester W. Lyman, established the Chester S. Lyman Lecture Series at Yale in memory of his father.

CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (or CpG ODN) are short single-stranded synthetic DNA molecules that contain a cytosine triphosphate deoxynucleotide (\\"C\\") followed by a guanine triphosphate deoxynucleotide (\\"G\\"). The \\"p\\" refers to the phosphodiester link between consecutive nucleotides, although some ODN have a modified phosphorothioate (PS) backbone instead. When these CpG motifs are unmethylated, they act as immunostimulants. CpG motifs are considered pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) due to their abundance in microbial genomes but their rarity in vertebrate genomes. The CpG PAMP is recognized by the pattern recognition receptor (PRR) Toll-Like Receptor 9 (TLR9), which is constitutively expressed only in B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in humans and other higher primates. History Since 1893, it has been recognized that Coley's toxin, a mixture of bacterial cell lysate, has immunostimulatory properties that could reduce the progression of some carcinomas, but it was not until 1983 that Tokunaga et al. specifically identified bacterial DNA as the underlying component of the lysate that elicited the response. Then, in 1995 Krieg et al. demonstrated that the CpG motif within bacterial DNA was responsible for the immunostimulatory effects and developed synthetic CpG ODN. Since then, synthetic CpG ODN have been the focus of intense research due to the Type I pro-inflammatory response they elicit and their successful use as vaccine adjuvants. Structural features Synthetic CpG ODN differ from microbial DNA in that they have a partially or completely phosphorothioated (PS) backbone instead of the typical phosphodiester backbone and a poly G tail at the 3' end, 5' end, or both. PS modification protects the ODN from being degraded by nucleases such as DNase in the body and poly G tail enhances cellular uptake. The poly G tails form intermolecular tetrads that result in high molecular weight aggregates. These aggregates are responsible for the increased activity the poly G sequence impart; not the sequence itself. Numerous sequences have been shown to stimulate TLR9 with variations in the number and location of CpG dimers, as well as the precise base sequences flanking the CpG dimers. This led to the creation of five unofficial classes or categories of CpG ODN based on their sequence, secondary structures, and effect on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The five classes are Class A (Type D), Class B (Type K), Class C, Class P, and Class S. It is important to note that during the discovery process, the \\"Classes\\" were not defined until much later when it became evident that ODN with certain characteristics elicited specific responses. Because of this, most ODN referred to in the literature use numbers (i.e., ODN 2006, ODN 2007, ODN 2216, ODN D35, ODN K3, etc.). The numbers are arbitrary and come from testing large numbers of ODN with slight variations in attempts to find the optimal sequence. In addition, some papers will give different names to previously described ODN, complicating the naming convention even more. Class A One of the first Class A ODN, ODN 2216, was described in 2001 by Krug et al. This class of ODN was distinctly different from the previously described Class B ODN (i.e., ODN 2006) in that it stimulated the production of large amounts of Type I interferons, the most important one being IFNŒ±, and induced the maturation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Class A ODN are also strong activators of NK cells through indirect cytokine signaling. Structural features defining Class A ODN: *The presences of a poly G sequence at the 5' end, the 3' end, or both *An internal palindrome sequence *GC dinucleotides contained within the internal palindrome *A partially PS-modified backbone Class A ODN typically contain 7 to 10 PS- modified bases at one or both ends that resist degradation by nucleases and increase the longevity of the ODN. The above rules strictly define the class, but variability of the sequence within these \\"rules\\" is possible. It should also be noted that changes to the sequence will affect the magnitude of the response. For example, the internal palindrome sequence can be 4 to 8 base pairs in length and vary in the order of bases, however the pattern, 5'-Pu Pu CG Pu Py CG Py Py-3', was found to be the most active when compared to several other sequences. The poly G tail found at either end of the DNA strand can vary in length and even number (Type D only have a poly G sequence on the 3'end), but its presence is critical to the activity of the molecule. Class B Krieg et al. was the first to describe Class B ODN in 1995. Class B ODN (i.e. ODN 2007) are strong stimulators of human B cell and monocyte maturation. They also stimulate the maturation of pDC but to a lesser extent than Class A ODN and very small amounts of IFNŒ±. Structural features defining Class B ODN: *One or more 6mer CpG motif 5'-Pu Py C G Py Pu-3' *A fully phosphorothioated (PS-modified) backbone *Generally 18 to 28 nucleotides in length The strongest ODN in this class have three 6mer sequences. B ODN have been studied extensively as therapeutic agents because of their ability to induce a strong humoral immune response, making them ideal as a vaccine adjuvant.

The park is managed as a \\"conservation park\\" with minimal improvements and facilities. The park is popular with anglers seeking steelhead during the fall, winter and spring, and also includes space for picnicking and hiking. In 2014, local residents began petitioning for state and local support to install the \\"Springville Whitewater Park\\" at the site, which would include dedicated access and space for whitewater rafting activities. Proposed dam lowering Concerns over the dam's structural integrity and the desire to remove a barrier to stream-running steelhead has led to a proposal to lower the currently- Scoby Dam by about . The $6.6 million (USD) proposal was put forth by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 2014, and if approved the work could happen within three years of the proposal's passage. In addition to lowering the dam, a fish ladder would also be installed to allow migratory fish to access an additional of Cattaraugus Creek and its tributaries above the dam. By allowing steelhead access beyond the dam, anglers would be able to seek these fish by utilizing an additional of public stream access. Currently, only of the stream below the dam is publicly accessible for fishing. Appropriate habitats for steelhead spawning exist above the dam, and its removal could allow for steelhead populations to become more self-sustaining. Currently, the steelhead fishery is maintained primarily through annual stocking of fish, however up to 25% of the creek's steelhead may be the result of natural reproduction. Critics of the project have raised concerns about impacts on resident brown and rainbow trout populations above the dam, and the possibility of introducing invasive species such as the sea lamprey into stretches of the creek currently free of such organisms. The USACE proposal includes barriers that are intended to restrict the movement of sea lamprey beyond the dam.

It was founded by Don Steen in 1998. USPI currently is active in 28 states. USPI currently operates over 400 ambulatory facilities serving 9,000 physicians and 3.4 million patients annually. The company had partnerships with over 4,000 physicians and over 50 health systems in the United States, with over 19,000 employees. The company went public in 2001 and was taken private again in 2007. In April 2015, USPI and Tenet Healthcare entered into an agreement to create the nation's largest ambulatory surgery platform. The transaction was finalized in June 2015. History United Surgical Partners International was founded in 1998 by Don Steen along with the primary stockholder Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe. The first USPI outpatient surgery facility was Dexeus Hospital in Barcelona, Spain. It was acquired in April 1998. The first US facilities were acquired with an acquisition in July 1998. They were in Tennessee, Missouri, and Alabama. The first hospital joint venture followed shortly in June 1999 with Baylor Health Care System. Business Strategy The company has developed a three-way-joint-venture model which involves the connection of hospital partner + physician + management company. USPI enters a targeted market by acquiring or developing surgical facilities in partnership with local physicians and, wherever possible, with a local hospital or health system. USPI approaches potential hospital partners to joint venture their outpatient surgical operations with those of USPI or to jointly develop a network of ASCs throughout the health system's service area.

However his official military career was cut short by an accident incurred when he was riding a horse. His left leg was paralyzedMarek Jan Chodkiewicz, \\"The Dialectics of Pain: The Interrogation Methods of the Communist Secret Police in Poland, 1944-1955\\", Glaukopis, vol 2/3, 2004-2005, pg. 48, [www.projectinposterum.org/docs/Torture.pdf] and he was released from the army. He married Jadwiga Oksiut√≥wna and settled in Mƒô≈ºenin on the Bug River where he had three children. Until the outbreak of World War II he served as the deputy W√≥jt (mayor) of Sarnaki and ran the village store. Some historians have speculated that he was involved in Polish military intelligence services at the time, in particular, gathering intelligence on the Polish communist Wanda Wasilewska, whom he knew personally. Against the Nazis Because of his injury he did not take part in the Invasion of Poland; however, he soon joined the anti-Nazi underground as part of the ZWZ and AK. He took part in the recovery of the German V2 rockets which were being tested in Poland, and their shipment to Great Britain.Kazimierz Krajewski, Tomasz ≈Åabuszewski, \\"Okres okupacji niemieckiej w ≈ºyciu W≈Çadys≈Çawa ≈Åukasiuka\\" (W≈Çadys≈Çaw ≈Åukasiuk's life during the German occupation), Ciechanowiec Online, His unit also took part in several skirmishes with the Germans and other military actions, including the blowing up of the rail bridge on the Siedlce- Czeremha rail line However, as far as it is known, ≈Åukasiuk did not participate in Operation Tempest because the front moved past the region he was operating in.Kazimierz Krajewski, Tomasz ≈Åabuszewski,\\" W walce z nowym okupantem\\" (In struggle against the new occupation), Ciechanowiec Online, Subsequently a plan was formed to unite all the local AK groupings and march to Warsaw to help in the Warsaw Uprising. Due to arrests and persecution of AK members by the Soviets however, the plan was not realized. After the NKVD carried out arrests and repression against the local population (including the arrest and deportation to the gulags of W≈Çadys≈Çaw's brother-in-law) he decided to join the anti-communist resistance and formed a partisan unit. Against the communists During the first few months in the new underground, M≈Çot's unit included four or five regular members, as well as part-time demobilized AK soldiers who remained under his orders. Few specifics are known about his actions during this period but it is known that the unit managed to stock pile an impressive arsenal of weapons out of what they brought with them from AK, from Allies' drops to the partisans and from arms left over after the front passed. In the Winter of 1944/45, still as a corporal he established contact with the Bialystok region AK command. In January 1945 he enlarged his partisan unit to a few dozen soldiers. Soon after, his group in their first skirmish with the Soviets defeated and broke up a NKVD operational group near Mƒô≈ºenin. Subsequently his partisans were incorporated into the much larger partisan unit of Teodor ≈ömia≈Çkowski, \\"Szumny\\". His platoon distinguished itself with its battle readiness and courage. During this time, ≈Åukasiuk took part in an underground military courses and was advanced to the rank of first lieutenant, and eventually captain.Kazimierz Krajewski, Tomasz ≈Åabuszewski, \\" W oddziale ppor. \\"Szumnego\\"\\" (In the unit of lieutenant \\"Szumny\\"), Ciechanowiec Online, In September 1945 \\"Szumny\\" was killed and his unit disbanded. The platoon headed by ≈Åukasiuk decided to continue fighting against the new communist authority joined the 5th Vilnian Home Army brigade and fought several skirmishes at Skiory, Zalesie, and Miodusy Pokrzywne. After the demobilization of the brigade, still wishing to continue fighting, he came under the command of Zygmunt Szendzielarz \\"≈Åupaszka\\". Soon the Szendzielarz brigade moved from the left bank of the Bug river to the region of Soko≈Ç√≥w Podlaski where, in October 1945 \\"M≈Çot\\" was made the commander of the 6th Vilnian Brigade. He was to lead it for the next three years, ably leading it in the field, escaping numerous attempts at capture by the communists authorities and carrying it through even the most difficult of circumstances. At one point a reward of 100,000 zlotych was established by the UB for information leading to his capture.Marian Pietrzak, \\"Szlakiem M≈Çota i ≈Åupaszki\\", Gazeta Sokolowksa, 26.09.2007, During this time the UB arrested ≈Åukasiuk's sister, Maria Sobolewska, after she was reported to the communist authorities by a neighbor. While arrested, she was tortured and beaten for three months but did not reveal any information about the whereabouts of her brother and refused to cooperate with the communist secret police. In 1945 she was tried for \\"treason against the People's Republic of Poland\\" and sentenced to ten years in prison, of which she served six.\\"HISTORIA \\"M≈ÅOTA\\" CZYLI DWIE POLSKI\\" (\\"Mlot\\"'s History, or the two Polands\\"), Documentary Film, 2002, Because the UB knew that ≈Åukasiuk was lame in the left leg, they resorted to arresting and torturing random people with the same handicap in the region in the hopes of catching him by accident. Death The official version of the communist government was that W≈Çadys≈Çaw ≈Åukasiuk \\"M≈Çot\\" died during a short vacation from fighting in the village of Czaje-W√≥lka in June 1947. He was shot by one of his deputies, Czes≈Çaw Dybowski, \\"Rejtan\\", because ≈Åukasiuk had just executed Czes≈Çaw's younger brother Leopold for disobeying orders (Leopold did not carry out the execution of an alleged member of the communists Polish secret police). After Czes≈Çaw shot Lukasiuk he took his younger brother to the doctor. Leopold died soon, due to gangrene. The communist secret police dug up Lukasiuk's and Leopold's body and moved them to an unknown location. Character and legacy W≈Çadys≈Çaw ≈Åukasiuk was respected by his men for his personal courage and partisan skills.Kazimierz Krajewski, Tomasz ≈Åabuszewski, \\"Sylwetki dow√≥dc√≥w partyzanckich. Ppor./kpt. W≈Çadys≈Çaw ≈Åukasiuk ‚ÄûM≈Çot\\"\\" (Portraits of partisan commanders), Ciechanowiec Online, Even though he had trouble moving about due of his paralyzed leg, he would always march at the head of his unit, using his SWT-40 carbine as a crutch (even though the unit possessed several wagons for transport). He was characterized by his careful and respectful approach to the civilian population of the area, regardless of their ethnicity, class or religion and on many occasions responded to appeals from locals to combat common bandits and thieves who were plentiful in the post-war chaos. This, in addition to his continued struggle against first the Nazis and then the repressive communist authorities, made \\"M≈Çot\\" a legend of Podlasie in his lifetime. During the communist era in Poland, however, he was officially vilified and defamed.

He served as Bishop of Saint Cloud from 1953 to 1968. Biography Peter Bartholome was born in Bellechester, Minnesota, the youngest son of Nicholas and Catherine (n√©e Jacobs) Bartholome, who were Luxembourgian immigrants. His mother, who died at age 103, was the first woman named Catholic Mother of the Year by the National Catholic Conference on Family Life in 1942 and received the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice medal in 1952. He received his early education at St. Mary's Grade School in Bellechester (1898-1905) before attending public school in Goodhue from 1906 to 1908. He studied at Campion College in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1914. He then returned to Minnesota and continued his studies at St. Paul Seminary in St. Paul. Bartholome was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Patrick Heffron on June 17, 1917. His first assignment was as a curate at St. John the Evangelist Church in Rochester, where he remained for two years. In 1919, he was appointed to the faculty of St. Mary's College in Winona, where he taught Latin, Greek, and philosophy. From 1928 to 1930, he studied canon law at the Apollinare University in Rome. Returning to Minnesota, Bartholome served as chaplain at the motherhouse of the Sisters of Saint Francis in Rochester for three years. He was pastor of St. John the Baptist Church in Caledonia from 1933 to 1936. He was then named diocesan director of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith and of the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine.

The plant ceased operation in 1993.See Kerr-McGee article for citations The plant was operated under Kerr-McGee Nuclear Corporation.Although exact date of KMNC formation is unknown to author, it was at least the early 1970s, and before that would have been simply KMC. In 1983 KMNC split into Quivira Mining Corporation and Sequoyah Fuels Corporation. The latter was given control of the plant. In 1988 Sequoyah Fuels Corporation was sold to General Atomics. In 2008 a company named International Isotopes said it would buy equipment and intellectual property from the Sequoyah Fuels Corp plant. The equipment would be used in a new location. It would be used for converting depleted uranium hexafluoride to depleted uranium tetrafluoride.  The 1986 Sequoyah Corporation Fuels Release in Oklahoma  Photograph of the rupture in the uranium hexafluoride container On January 4, 1986, Sequoyah Fuels Corporation experienced a rupture which killed 26-year-old worker, James Harrison and the hospitalized of 37 of the 42 onsite workers. The American Journal of Public Health describes the plant as having \\"never fully recovered\\" from the accident.Doug Brugge, et al, \\"The Sequoyah Corporation Fuels Release and the Church Rock Spill\\", American Journal of Public Health, September 2007, Vol, 97, No. 9, pp. 1596‚Äì1597.

The programme was presented by Gay Byrne, and aired Monday to Friday for two hours each day. It was a favourite of Irish housewives. Before Byrne's retirement in 1998, he was helped by Gareth O'Callaghan (who left for RT√â 2fm) and then Des Cahill. Future Labour Party face Alex White edited the show for four years. History The Gay Byrne Hour began broadcasting on 2 February 1973. It featured many Irish taboo subjects, with forums and discussions. In 1979, because of an extended air time, the programme was retitled The Gay Byrne Show. The show's reporter was Joe Duffy. In 1976, Byrne won a Jacob's Award for his programme.The Irish Times, \\"Critics honour 'Olives' and 'Riordans'\\", 16 May 1977 Duffy also won a Jacob's Award in 1992.The Irish Times, \\"Winners of radio and TV awards\\", 16 November 1992 In 1984, the show received letters in response to a report by Kevin O'Connor on the death of schoolgirl Ann Lovett from childbirth. Byrne and two actors read on air stories of rape, abortion and sexual abuse. Christine Buckley was invited with her father onto the show in 1992 to discuss her experiences at St. Vincent's Industrial School, Goldenbridge, receiving what she later described as an \\"overwhelming response\\". End Speculation that Byrne would leave his show began in January 1998. In August of that year, a spokeswoman for the Director of Radio confirmed the show would end. On 16 December 1998, while presenting his programme in Studio 5, Mike Murphy interrupted the programme and escorted a surprised Byrne into Studio 1. An audience of 150 celebrities and guests greeted Byrne. The then-Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and President Mary McAleese were among the guests. The final show was broadcast on Grafton Street, on Christmas Eve (24 December) 1998. Byrne later spoke of his regret at not having retired from presenting the show five years earlier. He also claimed that the craziest thing he had ever done was present the show live for so long.

He was a member of a well-educated family with close ties to eleventh Twelver Imam Hasan al‚ÄêAskari and a scholar of the Islamic sect known as the Alawites or Nusayris, which is now present in Syria, Southern Turkey and Northern Lebanon. A manuscript copy of a work by al‚ÄêKhasibi, copied in 1508, Egypt. Adilnor Collection, Sweden. For a time, al-Kha·π£ƒ´bƒ´ was imprisoned in Baghdad, due to accusations of being a Qarmatian. According to the Alawites, after settling in Aleppo, under the rule of the Shia Hamdanid dynasty, he gained the support and aid of its ruler, Sayf al-Dawla, in spreading his teachings. He later dedicated his book Kitab al‚ÄêHidaya al‚ÄêKubra to his patron. He died in Aleppo and his tomb, which became a holy shrine, is inscribed with the name Shaykh Yabraq. He taught several unique beliefs. One such belief was that Jesus was every one of the prophets from Adam to Muhammad, as well as other figures such as Socrates, Plato and some ancestors of Muhammad. Similarly, other historical figures were the incarnations of Ali and Salman al‚ÄêFarisi. He and his works were praised by the influential Iranian Shi øite scholar Muhammad Baqir Majlisi. Exposure to Nusayri Doctrine Al-Khasibi's first exposure to the teachings of Ibn Nusayr was through  øAbdallƒÅh al-JannƒÅn, who was a student of Mu·∏•ammad ibn Jundab, who was a student of Nusayr himself. Having been initiated into the doctrine through al-JannƒÅn, Khasibi was now al-JannƒÅn's \\"spiritual son\\". With the death of al-JannƒÅn, however, al-Khasibi had no means of continuing practice and study of the doctrine. This period of dryness ended later when he encountered an  øAlƒ´ ibn A·∏•mad, who claimed to be a direct disciple of Nusayr. In this manner, al-Khasibi received transmission from both al-JannƒÅn and  øAlƒ´ ibn A·∏•mad, thus continuing transmission of the Nusayri doctrine. Khasibi did not necessarily believe he was representative of a splinter, rebel group of the Shias, but rather believed he held the true doctrine of the Shias. During his reign, the founder of the Alawite sect, al- Khasibi, benefited from Sayf al-Dawla's patronage. Al-Khasibi turned Aleppo into the stable centre of his new sect, and sent preachers from there as far as Persia and Egypt with his teachings. His main theological work, Kitab al- Hidaya al-Kubra, was dedicated to his Hamdanid patron.

The Nechako (/n…ôÀàt É√¶ko ä/) River was once the greatest tributary of the Fraser River, and the watershed was used by the Carrier people. For centuries the Cheslatta T'en hunted, fished and trapped there and were part of an ancient trade network called the Grease Trail. The grease was actually eulachon oil.In the opening session of the Goldthorpe Inquiry into abuses in the Indian health system, in March 1980 in Alert Bay, seven elders ranging in age from 69 to 91 spoke at length of the healing qualities of traditional foods and herbs. In particular they \\"owed their survival to drinking oolachan oil\\" from the oolichan, or candlefish, a fatty Pacific coast smelt. The oil was a highly prized commodity grease trail and was carried in bentwood boxes that would often leak. It was named the Alexander Mackenzie Voyageur Route, then renamed the Nuxalk-Carrier Grease Trail to honour the guides. with the Nuxalk and Chilcotin. The Cheslatta village and Cheslatta Lake (Tsetl'adak Bunk'ut - ‚Ä≥Peak Rock Lake‚Ä≥) flooded due to the construction of the Kenney Dam. which created Nechako Reservoir, in 1952. Most members now live on a dozen small scattered reserves just south of Francois Lake. In 2013 the Cheslatta Carrier Nation (CCN) \\"are based at Southbank, on the south shore of Francois Lake, 23 kilometres south of Burns Lake (Tselhk'azbunk'ut - ‚Ä≥hone lake‚Ä≥). They have eight reserves on 1,400 hectares, with all reserves located at least five kilometres apart. They have 340 members, with 125 members living on reserve, although there is no central community. The band office and other community buildings are located on a reserve about two km south of the Southbank ferry dock.\\" The population on reserve is 167 and the population off reserve is 163, with a total of 330 according to the CNN INAC Active Band list reported in the 2011-2012 Language Needs Assessment report.  Language  Cheslatta, locally called Dakelh, is a dialect of the Carrier language of the Dene (Athabaskan) family of languages. \\"Carrier is the general term for a complex of Athabaskan dialects in central British Columbia, adjoining (but clearly distinct from) Babine on the northwest and Chilcotin on the south.\\" Of the 330 members of the CCN, 8 are fluent Cheslatta speakers, 18 understand or speak it somewhat and 100 are learning speakers. Dakelh/Carrier is traditionally divided into Upper and Lower Carrier. Upper Carrier includes communities to the north of Fort St. James, around Stuart and Trembleur Lakes. Lower Carrier is spoken in communities in the south. Linguists argue that Lower Carrier should be split into two dialect groups, the Fraser/Nechako and the Blackwater. The Fraser/Nechako would include Prince George, Cheslatta, Stoney Creek, Nautley, and Stellakoh. The Blackwater group would include the Ulkatcho, Kluskus, Nazko, Red Bluff, and Anahim Lake.  Chief and Councillors  Corrina Leween is Chief, and Hazel Burt and Ted Jack are Councillors (2015-2018). The Cheslatta Carrier Nation is represented by the British Columbia Assembly of First Nations (BCAFN), a Political Territorial Organization (PTO), a branch of the Assembly of First Nations. The BCAFN represents the 203 First Nations in British Columbia.  Treaty process  The community, which is negotiating independently, has reached Stage 3 in the BC Treaty Process.  History  \\"For centuries the Cheslatta T'en hunted, fished and trapped in the Nechako River (Nechakoh - ‚Ä≥Blackwater People's River‚Ä≥) area at the headwaters of the Fraser River (Lhtakoh - ‚Ä≥rivers within one another‚Ä≥), West Road River (Blackwater River) (Tanilhtl'uz - ‚Ä≥muddy water‚Ä≥), and Bulkley Rivers (Wet'sinkwha - \\"blue and green river\\", name of the Wet ºsuwet ºen, another branch of the Carrier people) as well as areas around Stuart (Nak'albun - ‚Ä≥Mount Pope Lake‚Ä≥) Babine lakes (Na-taw-bun-kut - \\"Long Lake\\") up to the borders of Bear Lake (Sustoobunk'ut, ·ôê·îÜ·óú·ó™·ê£·óΩ·ê™ - \\"black bear water lake\\", or Sustootibunk'ut, ·ôê·îÜ·óú·ó†·ó™·ê£·óΩ·ê™ - \\"black bear water trail lake\\"). To the east, Carrier traditional territory extended as far as the Rocky Mountains.‚Ä≥ Long before contact with Europeans, they fished for trout, char, kokanee and whitefish in the freshwater lakes and traded with neighbouring villages for sockeye and chinook salmon. In later years many Cheslatta people had large vegetable gardens and herds of cattle and horses for which they grew fields of timothy and clover. Some worked for local sawmills or ranchers and ran traplines to earn cash to buy supplies they could not produce themselves.\\" In 1792-93 Nuxalk-Carrier guides led Alexander Mackenzie along the grease trail, a network of trails that were thousands of years old from the Fraser River to Bella Coola. = Flooding of traditional lands = In a major multi-authored interdisciplinary and multi-institution report entitled \\"Threats to Water Availability in Canada\\" published by Environment Canada and researched by National Water Research Institute, an entire section focused on the Nechako - Kemano Diversion as case study. In 1950 the B.C. government and the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan; Rio Tinto Alcan since 2008) through then-director Ray Edwin Powell entered into an agreement to facilitate the develop of a hydroelectric project that would support Alcan's new aluminum smelting industry at Kitimat, British Columbia. The $500-million project at Kitimat, British Columbia, was the largest public-private partnership ever introduced in Canada in 1951. British Columbia \\"signed over in perpetuity and at a nominal charge a huge area and much of its resource wealth-agricultural and park lands, water, forests and fish. All waters covered by the licence were to be diverted before the year 2000.\\" Phase I \\"redirected flows of 115 cubic metres per second on average from the Nechako River (Fraser basin) to spill westward by tunnel through the Coast Mountains, a vertical drop 16 times higher than Niagara Falls, into the Kemano River basin.\\" While the Kenney Dam was under construction and the Nechako Reservoir was filled, there was a 100% loss of flow in the upper Nechako River. In October 1952 the Nechako Reservoir started to fill. In 1954 the Kenney Dam was completed, creating a body 145 miles long that covered 339 square miles. Alcan sent in a crew to build a stone cairn on the highest ground at the site of the village on Ootsa Lake just before it was flooded, and eventually a plaque was attached. Then Alcan restored 60% to 70% of the flow of the Nechako River \\"via a spillway that discharged, not from Kenney Dam but down the Cheslatta, a tributary of the Nechako. The comparatively large discharge down this small tributary scoured a deep channel in the unconsolidated sediments and deposited huge volumes of sediment in the upper Nechako. Due to a smaller dam constructed near the mouth of the Cheslatta, homes and a graveyard of the local Indian community were flooded. The community was forced to relocate on short notice to a new area and unfamiliar way of life, which led eventually to demands for redress of their losses.\\" In 1993, the Government of Canada paid the CCN $7.4 million in a settlement for inadequate compensation in 1952.

He served as Bishop of Newark from 1881 until his death in 1901. Early life and education Winand Wigger was born in New York City to John Joseph and Elizabeth (n√©e Strucke) Wigger, who immigrated to the United States from Westphalia in the late 1830s. The second of four children, he had three brothers: Joseph John, Robert, and Theodore. He was a sickly child and the family returned to Germany in December 1843 in the hope that a sea voyage might better his health. In August 1845, the family moved back to New York, where his father became successful and prosperous. Wigger attended the parochial school of St. Francis of Assisi Church and in September 1853 entered St. Francis Xavier's College, where he studied the classics and distinguished himself as an accomplished student and skilled musician. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in July 1860. Deciding to follow a vocation to the priesthood, he then applied to St. Joseph's Seminary in Fordham but was rejected due to poor health. Wigger was instead accepted at Seton Hall Seminary in the Diocese of Newark, New Jersey. In 1862, he went to further his studies at the seminary of Brignole-Sale in Genoa, Italy, where he was ordained a priest by Archbishop Andreas Charvaz on June 10, 1865. Before returning home, he spent several months in Rome and Westphalia. Priesthood During Wigger's voyage back to the United States in 1866, his steamship suffered an outbreak of cholera among the passengers in steerage; after docking at the Bay of New York, the young priest remained on board for two weeks to administer to the sick and dying. After arriving in Newark, he was assigned as an assistant priest at St. Patrick's Cathedral. U.S. Senator James Smith (D-New Jersey) later described his years at St. Patrick's by saying, \\"Other young priests found time for social diversion, but Dr. Wigger knew only one pleasure--to do his duty. He not only gave wise counsel to those who sought it, but from his own means he gave alms to the needy; he was ever ready to aid the suffering and to offer the consolations of religion to the sick and the dying. Young as he was, he was regarded by the poor and the simple as a true father.\\" In 1869 he returned to Rome and there earned a doctorate in sacred theology from the University of the Sapienza. Following his return to the Newark Diocese, Wigger was appointed pastor of St. Vincent's Church at Madison in April 1869. His financial abilities caught the attention of Bishop Michael Corrigan, who transferred him in May 1873 to St. John's Church in Orange, which was then over a quarter million dollars in debt. Wigger lessened the debt to some degree (raising about $2,000 every month), but his hard work caused his health to suffer. He was the founding pastor of St. Teresa's Church in Summit from 1874 until 1876, when he returned to St. Vincent's in Madison. He constructed a new rectory for St. Vincent's in 1877. Episcopal ministry Following Bishop Corrigan's promotion to Coadjutor Archbishop of New York in October 1880, Wigger was appointed the third Bishop of Newark by Pope Leo XIII on July 11, 1881. He received his episcopal consecration on the following October 18 from Archbishop Corrigan, with Bishops John Loughlin and Bernard John McQuaid serving as co- consecrators, at St. Patrick's Cathedral. In August of that year, the Diocese of Trenton was carved out of the Diocese of Newark, consisting of the southern part of the state. Shortly afterwards, Wigger declared, \\"In the Church of God there is no distinction of race, color or tongue.\\" At the time of his consecration as a bishop, there were 121 priests, 83 churches, 18,396 students enrolled in diocesan schools, and 145,000 Catholics in the diocese; by the time of his death nearly twenty years later, there were 256 priests, 153 churches, 34,817 students, and 300,000 Catholics. After making a survey of all the church property in the Newark Diocese, the Bishop negotiated a loan of $2 million at a low interest rate to cover the mortgages on many churches. He also made Seton Hall Seminary one of the chief objects of his solicitude, and even established his residence there. In 1883, he removed the Catholic Protectory to Mount Arlington and established the Sacred Heart Union to aid in its maintenance. Wigger was fiercely hostile to alcohol abuse, and even ordered in 1884 that the last rites of the Church be denied to those who sold alcohol to minors or drunkards. Given the drinking habits among the Irish in New Jersey, some viewed Wigger's hostility to drink as an anti-Irish bias. He also met conflict with the German-speaking immigrant population who were attracted to non-Catholic societies and religions; the Bishop was committed to preserve the faith of the German immigrants. A central figure in the Cahensly controversy, he also insisted on German parishes, with their own schools, and the preservation of German culture. Wigger appointed his first vicar general in 1885, attended the Third Council of Baltimore, and held the fifth diocesan synod in November 1886, at which strict regulations were enacted in regard to funerals and attendance at parochial and public schools. He even threatened excommunication against Catholic parents who sent their children to non- Catholic schools, and unsuccessfully attempted to introduce state legislation to secure the state's support for Catholic schools. One of Wigger's greatest achievements was the construction of the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart. The City of Newark wanted to buy the site for the new Newark High School in 1896, but the Bishop rejected the idea. He broke ground in January 1898, and laid the cornerstone in June 1899. =Later life and death= After celebrating Christmas Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral in 1900, Wigger was stricken with pneumonia and went abroad in search of rest and health. On his return he resumed his duties but later died in his bedroom at Seton Hall, aged 59. His funeral Mass was celebrated by Archbishop Corrigan, and his remains were buried in the priests' plot in the Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in East Orange.

Pesticides are used predominantly by the agricultural sector. In 2016, 20% of reported pesticide sales were non-agricultural sector products (including forestry, aquaculture and assorted industrial uses), and just under 5% were domestic sector products.  History  The importation and sale of pesticide products has been regulated in Canada since 1927, originally under the federal Act to Regulate the Sale and Inspection of Agricultural Economic Poisons. This Act was replaced in 1939 by the Pest Control Products Act (PCPA) and Regulations. Up until the 1940s, pesticides were primarily organic or inorganic substances (such as sodium chlorate and sulphuric acid) derived from natural sources. However these natural products had drawbacks such as their high rates of application, lack of selectivity and high phytotoxicity. In the 1930s, a concern grew about the use of these pesticides; particularly against the use of arsenic insecticides that had resulted in deaths during the 1920s and 1930s. This growing concern and the discovery of newer more effective and inexpensive products such as DDT, BHC, aldrin, chlordane, parathion, captan and 2,4-D led to an increase in the use of synthetic pesticides in the 1940s. Prior to the 1950s, most consumers and policy makers were not overly concerned or aware about the potential health and environmental risks associated with the use of pesticides. As research into pesticides continued government policies shifted to better address these potential risks. In 1954, the Pest Control Products Regulations were revised to require applicants to provide evidence of the safety as well as the efficacy of their products prior to its registration. In 1968, the PCPA was further revised so that its main focus shifted from efficacy to public safety. From the 1970s to 1990s, researchers focused on developing products that required lower rates of application and that had a single mode of action allowing the use of pesticides to be more selective. This time period also saw the rise of resistance issues and management strategies such as integrated pest management (IPM) were introduced to combat this problem. Prior to the creation of the Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) in 1995, the Pest Control Products Act was administered by the Department of Agriculture. In addition to the Department of Agriculture, other federal departments had key roles in the Canadian regulatory process of pesticides. The prevention of the contamination of the environment was regulated by the Department of Fisheries and Ocean and the Department of Environment, who focused on the effects of pesticides on fisheries and aquatic ecosystems and the effects on wildlife respectively. The Department of Health and Welfare concentrated on the effects pesticides had on human health, particularly the health of those involved in the manufacturing, handling and application of pesticides and the health of others who may have been exposed indirectly such as through residues on food. Other departments that played a regulatory role included the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, regarding Artic water pollution, and the Department of Transport, which regulated the transportation of dangerous goods. The Canadian Association of Pesticide Control Officials (CAPCO) was responsible to facilitate the information flow between both the departments and levels of government to aid in the coordination of federal and provincial regulatory efforts. The committee was made up of representatives from each of the provinces and territories and the federal departments Agriculture Canada, Environment Canada, and Health and Welfare Canada. The PMRA was created on April 1, 1995 as part of an ongoing government effort to reform the pesticide regulatory regime in Canada. Staff and resources were consolidated from several federal departments into a single branch under Health Canada. Subsequently, the administration of the Pest Control Products Act was transferred from the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food to the Minister of Health. Regulation In Canada, pesticide regulation is under the shared authority of the federal, provincial, territorial governments as well as municipal entities. The use, manufacture, storage, distribution, application, sale, and labeling of pest control products is governed by various Acts, regulations, guidelines, directives and by-laws. Pesticides are carefully regulated in Canada through a program of pre-market scientific assessment, enforcement, education, and information dissemination. All levels of government work together to help protect Canadians and the environment from any risks posed by pesticides and to ensure that pest control products do what they claim to on the label. =Federal= The Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) is responsible for pesticide regulation in Canada. Their roles include administering the Pest Control Products Act and Regulations, registering pest control products, re-evaluating registered products and setting maximum residue limits under the Food and Drugs Act. Prior to registration, all pest control products undergo a pre-market assessment to ensure the products are safe when used according to use directions. Applications also undergo efficacy assessments to ensure the products work. Once it is approved by PMRA, the product is registered and given a Pest Control Product (PCP) registration number which can be found on the product label. The pesticide is re-evaluated if it has been more than 15 years since the last major regulatory decision to ensure they meet the latest Canada's health and environmental standards. The PMRA applies science-based decision making to premarket and post market reviews. These reviews incorporate human health and environmental risk assessments, as well as value and product chemistry evaluations. The evaluations consist of a risk-based approach which assesses hazardous properties and possible exposure. Health Canada is responsible to promote, monitor, and enforce pesticide compliance activities under the Pest Control Products Act (PCPA) and Regulations. Health Canada also responds to incidents, complaints and situations of non-compliance. Compliance officers are located across Canada and inspectors conduct regular, planned inspections to verify compliance of activities regulated under the PCPA. The National Pesticides Compliance Program (NPCP) is administered jointly by two branches of Health Canada, the Pest Management Regulatory Agency and the Regulatory Operations and Enforcement Branch (ROEB). = Provincial and Territorial = Provinces and territories may regulate the application, sale, storage of pest control products in their individual jurisdictions but only as long as the measures they adopt are consistent with any conditions, directions and limitations imposed under the PCPA or other federal legislation. These are regulated via a system of permits and licenses for business to sell products, for applicators to apply products (including mandatory training), and facilities to store products. Provinces and territories also carry out enforcement and compliance monitoring, and response to spills or accidents in cooperation with Health Canada‚Äôs regional offices. = Municipal = Cities, towns, and municipalities can be given the power by provinces and territories to regulate how pesticides are used locally, including creating bylaws to restrict pesticide use. The 2001 Spraytech v Hudson case set the precedent in the Supreme Court of Canada as regards the enforcement of municipal by-laws against pesticides. The 2005 CropLife v Toronto case further cemented the law regarding municipal pesticide bans. = Cosmetic pesticide bans = The ban on cosmetic lawn pesticides started from municipalities regulating their use, which then spread across the province and onwards. The Quebec government was the first province to regulate the use and sale of cosmetic pesticides in April 2003, when it introduced the Quebec Pesticides Management Code. The code was phased in over the course of 3 years and by April 2006 the use and sale of lawn pesticides was banned province-wide. The Ontario provincial government promised on September 24, 2007 to also implement a province-wide ban on the cosmetic use of lawn pesticides, for protecting the public.Latest News Medical and environmental groups support such a ban.http://cela.ca/uploads/f0803f62de5d2a1f673df7aaaca0e77b/ONPesticideBanStatement.pdf On April 22, 2008, the Provincial Government of Ontario announced an intention to prohibit, province-wide, the cosmetic use and sale of lawn and garden pesticides. The Ontario province-wide pesticide ban on lawn pesticides came into effect with the Ontario Cosmetic Pesticides Ban Act on Earth Day, April 22, 2009.http://www.ene.gov.on.ca/en/news/2009/030401.php Over 250 products are banned for sale and more than 95 pesticide ingredients are banned for cosmetic uses.http://www.ene.gov.on.ca/en/land/pesticides/class-pesticides.php The Ontario legislation would also echo Massachusetts law requiring pesticide manufacturers to reduce the toxins they use in production. New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island adopted legislation in 2009 and 2010 respectively, banning just one lawn pesticide - the herbicide 2,4-D.http://www.gnb.ca/cnb/news/env/2009e0865ev.htmhttp://www.producer.com/2012/02/when- bans-become-banes%E2%80%A9/ As of April 2015, seven provinces (Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario and Alberta) have legislation in place banning the use of some or all chemical pesticides for cosmetic use. Issues Placard against pesticides on a window. =Pesticide residue in foodsEffects on biota= There is a concern that pesticides may negatively impact non-target species. In 1999 at Montague on Prince Edward Island, nine fish kills happened in one year: every fish, snake, and snail was killed in a river called Sutherland's Hole near potato farms from which herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides ran off after heavy rains.Toughill K (1999), \\"The summer the rivers died: Toxic runoff from potato farms is poisoning P.E.I.\\" Originally published in Toronto Star Atlantic Canada Bureau. Retrieved on September 17, 2007. In the 2003 PEI State of the Environment Report reported an increasing trend towards the numbers of pesticide-related fish kills. The PEI Department of Fisheries, Aquaculture and Environment concluded that the fish kills were the result of heavy rainfall occurring shortly after spraying; contaminating water runs off fields into streams that were not adequately protected. In response the Government of PEI restricted the use of azinphos-methyl, an insecticide implicated in many of the fish kills. During that same time period, the Pest Management Regulatory Agency announced that all uses of this pesticide were to be phased out by the end of 2006. PEI also established agricultural buffer zone for watercourses under the Environmental Protection Act and increased the level of enforcement while substantially raising the fines for violations. By 2010, recent years showed a considerable decrease in fish kills. A 1998 laboratory study conducted at Trent University showed that exposing tadpoles to endosulfan, an organochloride pesticide at levels that are likely to be found in habitats near fields sprayed with the chemical kills the tadpoles and causes behavioral and growth abnormalities.Raloff, J (September 5, 1998) \\"Common pesticide clobbers amphibians\\".

Opinion On April 3, 2008, the Canadian Cancer Society released opinion poll results conducted by Ipsos Reid, which established that a clear majority of residents in the provinces of British Columbia and Saskatchewan want province-wide cosmetic lawn pesticide bans, and that the majority of respondents believe that cosmetic pesticides are a threat to their health.greenactioncentre.ca: \\"Why We Support a Province-wide Ban on Cosmetic Pesticides\\", July 2011 A survey conducted Canada-wide by Ipsos Public Affairs in March 2017 found that respondents generally associated pesticides with negative connotations. Respondents were found to be most critical of pesticide use on food imported into Canada and on fruits and vegetables. Despite their negative outlook on pesticide use, most respondents felt that the Canadian government was doing a good job at regulating pesticide products. Furthermore, the majority of respondents agreed that pesticides are necessary and serve a purpose. Lobbying The Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment, a non-profitable organization dedicated to environmental issues especially as they relate to human health, have campaigned on the hazards of lawn pesticides.

Background Stacelita is a dark bay or black mare who was bred in France by Jean-Pierre Joseph Dubois. By leading German sire Monsun, she was out of the stakes-winning mare Soign√©e by Dashing Blade. Martin Schwartz bought a share in the mare from her breeder in May 2009 and then assumed full ownership in 2010. She was originally trained by Jean-Claude Rouget, and later by Chad Brown. Racing career Stacelita began her career with six straight wins including the Group I Prix Saint-Alary, Prix de Diane and Prix Vermeille, the latter as a result of the disqualification of Dar Re Mi. She finished her three-year-old campaign with a seventh-place finish in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe behind Sea the Stars after setting the early pace. She began 2010 by finishing fourth in the Prix d'Ispahan behind Goldikova. She then won La Coupe at Longchamps before finishing second to Midday in the Nassau Stakes at Goodwood in her first trip outside of France. On 22 August, she won the Group I Prix Jean Romanet by a head over Antara but then finished second in the Prix de l'Op√©ra to stablemate Lily of the Valley. She finished the year by finishing eighth in the Hong Kong Cup behind Snow Fairy. Stacelita began her five-year-old campaign in France by finishing third in La Coupe on 13 June 2011. She was then shipped to America for the Grade I United Nations Stakes on 2 July, but finished third behind Teaks North. Moved to the barn of trainer Chad Brown, she won the Beverly D. Stakes on 13 August by lengths over Dubawi Heights. \\"I had an absolutely wonderful trip\\", said jockey Ramon Dom√≠nguez. \\"I was able to sit right off the leader. Nice and relaxed, comfortable fractions. Turning for home, once I found a seam on the rail, I had to go for it and she reached for it great.\\" Stacelita returned to win the Flower Bowl Invitational on 1 October before finishing a disappointing tenth in the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf in the final race of her career. Despite that loss, Stacelita was named the 2011 Eclipse Award winner as champion female turf horse, winning 158 of 211 votes. Retirement Stacelita was retired to broodmare duty and was bred in 2012 to Smart Strike. The resulting filly, foaled in 2013, was named Southern Stars and became a winner in Great Britain. Stacelita was then sold to Shadai Farm and bred to Frankel. The resultant filly, produced in 2014, was named Soul Stirring and became Frankel's first Grade/Group One winner when she won the Hanshin Juvenile Fillies in December 2016. Soul Stirring went on to win the Yushun Himba (Japanese Oaks) in 2017. Pedigree Stacelita was sired by Monsun, who won the Europa Preis twice as a racehorse and became the leading sire in Germany four times. Monsun was at the forefront of a \\"renaissance\\" for German breeding, helped by the fact that his pedigree represented an outcross for the \\"ever-increasing saturation of Northern Dancer\\" in European bloodlines. Known for their stamina and soundness, German-breds made their first major impact in Europe through Urban Sea who was out of the German-bred mare Allegreta. Urban Sea won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and became the dam of leading sire Galileo and his half-brother Sea the Stars. At the time of his death in 2012, Monsun was the sire of 108 stakes winners around the world, including Breeders' Cup Turf winner Shirocco. Stacelita's dam Soignee was sired by Dashing Blade, a descendant of Mill Reef. Soignee's dam Suivez descended from Northern Dancer on her sire's side and from the influential German mare Schwartzgold on the dam's side. This family has produced multiple stakes winners around the world including American champion turf male Steinlen, Irish Derby winner Zagreb and French champion Sagace.
