Synopsis The novel's central character is Joe Cashin, a Melbourne homicide detective. Following serious physical injuries he is posted to his hometown Port Munro, where he begins the process of rebuilding the old family mansion and his physical and mental strength. Against a background of family tragedy, politics, police corruption and racism, he investigates the death of a wealthy local man, Charles Burgoyne. His closest friend and police superior is Villani, who is the central character in Truth. Style Written by the award-winning author Peter Temple, the book continues with his trademark stark, staccato dialog, where superfluous words are removed and the meaning of each sentence must be dug out. In a typical example of Temple's flourish he describes a nearby derelict town as ‚Äúhardcore [where] ‚Äì the unemployed, under-employed, unemployable, the drunk and doped, the old-age pensioners, people on all kinds of welfare, the halt, the lame\\".

It is widely harvested in Japan where it is known as and eaten as sushi. Like other members of its order it has a powerful spear, which it uses to hunt invertebrates and small fish. It grows to a length of , and lives at depths of .  Coloring  The overall color of the Japanese mantis shrimp is light grey to light brown with dark red grooves running down the thorax and abdomen; The color of its posterior tips is dark green.Ahyong, Shane T. The Marine Fauna of New Zealand: Mantis Shrimps (Crustacea:Stomatopoda). National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA), 2012.  Habitat  Japanese mantis shrimp typically reside in a wide variety of habitats including the shore, coral reefs, and level substrates. It is native to the Northwestern Pacific in the oceans near Korea, Japan, Taiwan, China, and Vietnam. In recent years the Japanese mantis shrimp has been artificially introduced to oceans near Australia and New Zealand where it has become an invasive species. It occupies long U shaped burrows in soft sediments which it excavates with its maxillipeds. It stays tucked away within these burrows in the daylight hours for refuge and rarely emerges except in the night. These burrows are also used to spawn and lay eggs in. If the burrow is not of compatible size, egg laying is inhibited and as a result if the burrow becomes too small, the Japanese mantis shrimp will expand its burrow or create a more suitably sized one.  Hunting and Diet  The Japanese mantis shrimp is a predator that actively hunts and kills its prey. At night it emerges from its burrow to hunt prey which it then brings back to their burrow in order to feed. It is considered to be a type in between spearer types, which use their claws to pierce soft bodied prey, and smasher types, which use a club to smash hard bodied prey. It feeds on an assortment of organisms varying with habitat including crustaceans, mollusks, small rays, small fishes, worms and algae. It has also been observed to cannibalize smaller members of their species in times of food scarcity.  Reproduction and Life Cycle  Reproduction for Japanese mantis shrimp occurs between mature inter molt pairs. Female Japanese mantis shrimp achieve reproductive maturity by late spring to early summer lasting until fall while males have year round reproductive maturity. There are several behavioral components in its courtship. One mating behavior that it demonstrates is attenuation between male and female where they face each other and mutually stroke antennas for several seconds. They have also been found to engage in pair walking, where mates walk closely together side by side, and engage in brushing where the male brushes the female with its appendages. After fertilization the females spawn in the burrow and the female subsequently nurses the eggs until they hatch. Females devote significant periods of time to nursing their eggs and as a result rarely leave their burrows unless to feed. When emerging from their burrow the female carries her eggs in her maxillipeds for safekeeping. In the period shortly before the eggs hatch the female has been observed to neglect the eggs and feed more frequently. The typical embryonic life of an egg is about 14 days. The larvae of the Japanese mantis shrimp follows 11 larval stages with active swimming and feeding beginning in the third larval stage. The larval stage ends in around 32 to 51 days and the juvenile stage begins.  In cuisine  The consumption of the Japanese mantis shrimp can for the most part be only found in Japan as the price and availability of it limits its popularity abroad. It is most tasty during the period of spring as it is their breeding season and is occasionally also eaten with its roe. Its texture and flavor is said to be somewhere in between eel and shrimp. The appearance of shako in the form of sushi began in the 1950s where it was commonly brushed with nitsume and presented as nigiri. Shako was originally prepared by boiling it in a sugar syrup, but is now typically prepared through a slow simmer allowing its freshness to last longer.

The competition was run on a regional basis, with 17 regional associations holding separate qualification rounds. The winners of each of these qualification tournaments, along with the second-placed team from Auckland, qualified for the competition proper. In all, 95 teams took part in the competition, 32 from the South Island and 63 from the North Island. Note: Different sources record different numbers for the rounds of this competition, with some confusion caused by differing numbers of rounds in regional qualification. The 1967 final North Shore United returned to the final, this time with former international Ken Armstrong as coach. In the final they met Christchurch City - soon to change its name to Christchurch United, a recently amalgamated team featuring players who had previously been with several strong southern sides, among them future internationals Terry Haydon and Tony Gowans. The game was an exciting one. The Christchurch side dominated for the entire first half, but a combination of missed chances, the woodwork, a disallowed goal, and heroics from Shore keeper Dennis Mack kept the first half scoreless. In the second spell, Billy Rimmer scored for the Aucklanders early but the lead was soon cancelled out by a strike from Haydon. A late penalty for City was missed by Gowans, and Shore made the most of their chance by stealing a late winner through Ian Campbell. pp. 74-5 Results Third round * Won by Suburbs on toss of coin ‚Ä† Won by North Shore on corners ¬∂ Won by Western Suburbs on corners Fourth round Fifth round Quarter-finals Semi-finals * some sources give the result as 2-1 aet Final References *Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation New Zealand 1967 page *ultimatenzsoccer.com 1967 Chatham Cup page Chatham Cup Chatham Cup Chatham Cup ","title":"1967 Chatham Cup"},{"id":"19124047","text":"Outside The Nine is the official fan club of American metal band Slipknot, and was launched in 2005.

It was a conventional, high-wing, strut-braced monoplane with a fully enclosed cabin and cockpit, and followed the general pattern developed by Kalinin in his earlier designs, though on a larger scale.  Development  Kalinin had first considered an airliner for 10-12 passengers as early as 1926, but it was not until Ukrvozduhput expressed interest in such a machine late the following year that work on the design began in earnest. The prototype was ready by mid-autumn 1929, and first flew on October 18 with Mikhail Artemevich Snegirev at the controls. Safety trials for the State Commission commenced on 30 May 1930, and were passed successfully. Ongoing problems with the aircraft's Gnome et Rh√¥ne-built Bristol Jupiter engine resulted in the second prototype being powered by a Pratt & Whitney Hornet instead. This machine undertook further testing and a number of promotional flights before series production of the K-5 commenced. Early production examples were used on trial services between Kharkiv and Moscow, Mineralnye Vody, and Baku. Problems with the Bessonov M-15 engines became quickly apparent, with frequent failures and operational lifespans measured in only dozens of hours. K-5 operations were suspended by the Inspectorate of Civil Aviation until the issues were resolved. Kalinin turned to the Shvetsov M-22 as an alternative powerplant. While reliability increased, this engine installation also created more drag than the M-15 had, and performance decreased accordingly. State Acceptance trials carried out in May‚ÄìJune 1932 confirmed the reliability of the engine with 550 takeoffs and landings and 2,000 steep turns, but found that the payload capacity was now unacceptably low. By this time, however, the M-15 had become reliable enough for restrictions to be lifted and K-5 production resumed, and eventually about 100 K-5s were fitted with this engine. The reliability of the revised M-15 design was vindicated by a gruelling flight through the Caucasus on 25 June 1933. Eventually, the Mikulin M-17F provided the definitive powerplant for the K-5, offering an increase in power and performance over the M-15, but decreasing the aircraft's payload and range due to its greater weight. The new engine also required strengthening of the wing design; the first K-5 fitted with this engine suffered structural damage during flight tests due to the increase in engine power.  Operational history  The K-5 was widely used by Aeroflot, displacing German-built Junkers F 13s and Dornier Komets in regular service. The first scheduled route flown by K-5s was Moscow-Kharkov, followed by services between Moscow and Sverdlovsk, Tashkent, and Arkhangelsk. They remained in service until 1940, becoming the backbone of Aeroflot's domestic operations. The K-5 was also used by the Soviet Air Force as a transport aircraft, operating in this capacity until 1943.

It was the first hanging monorail in North America. It existed solely for entertainment, not transportation, as it had only one station. It offered views not only of the Seaquarium exhibits and buildings, but also of the Miami skyline. There were six cars, though only five were run at a time, and the cars had names after fish. The cars had unique styling until they were redesigned in 1978 to be rectangular and their names were removed. The cars operated around the loop counterclockwise, and had an Automatic Block Signal system. In 1991, the Seaquarium was to be expanded. By that time, the monorail ridership was low, due to a loss of novelty. Furthermore, it was obsolete and labor-intensive. There was some consideration to turn the monorail into a parking lot, but in the end, the monorail was demolished, because the expanded park crowded out the views from the ride, although this may not have been an issue if the monorail had been built to operate in the opposite direction. The cars are now used as storage sheds, although there are some calls to preserve them.

Founded in 1954 by Elmer Iseler as the Festival Singers of Toronto, the choir was first heard on CBC radio in a 1955 Good Friday broadcast of Bach's Christ lag in Todesbanden. Initially consisting of only 25 voices, the choir expanded to 32 voices and attracted international attention for their work in the early 1960s with Igor Stravinsky. Their recording of Symphony of Psalms, conducted by Stravinsky, was nominated in 1965 for a Grammy Award. Tenor Gordon Wry was one of the founding singers of the chorus. The choir made its US debut in December 1967 at the White House. In 1968 the choir changed its name to the Festival Singers of Canada and became the first Canadian choir to develop professional status. At this time, the chorus became the core of the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir. Expanding to 36 voices, the ensemble toured Europe in 1971, and again in 1972 with the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir. Further US appearances included concerts at Lincoln Center (1972), the Kennedy Center (1976), and the Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul in Philadelphia (1977). In 1977 the choir toured England, West Germany, and the USSR. In Canada the ensemble toured the west in 1974 and 1977 and the east in 1975 and appeared at the Stratford Festival during the summers of 1955, 1956, 1958, 1963-7 and 1974, the Guelph Spring Festival 1968, 1973, and 1975-7, the winter seasons of the Shaw Festival at Niagara-on-the-Lake 1973-6, and the 1976 Olympics in Montreal. Annual concert series were given in Toronto, and at the height of their fame the singers gave about 25 concerts each year on the CBC. Excepting a period of about a year and a half (late 1960 to early 1962) when ill health forced his temporary resignation, Iseler was the Festival Singers' regular conductor until 1978. In Iseler's absence, Lloyd Bradshaw conducted several concerts, and Walter Susskind and Rowland Pack each conducted one. Iseler himself - as a guest - conducted the final concert in the 1961-2 series prior to returning as artistic director in August 1962, and he retained the position for the ensuing 16 years. Ruth Watson Henderson served as the choir's accompanist from 1968-1979. By the mid-1970s there was dissatisfaction about the Festival Singers' objectives and policies among its constituent components - choir members, artistic director, management, and board. Furthermore, concern about the levels and sources of its funding prompted the Canada Council to commission a review of the choir's affairs in 1976. In 1978 these contentious issues resulted in the board announcement on 12 May that Iseler's contract would not be renewed. Giles Bryant was named music director in June 1978, and Peter McCoppin, Jon Washburn, Brian Law, and John Barnum appeared as guest conductors during the 1978-9 season. The season was not a financial success, due in part to decreased use of the choir by the CBC. The Festival Singers announced suspension of activities in April 1979 and filed an assignment of bankruptcy 30 Jul 1979.

In the , Gregory had a population of 72 people.  Geography  The town is situated on the banks of the perennial Gregory River. The Gregory River was named by explorer William Landsborough on 19 November 1861, after explorer Augustus Charles Gregory, the first Surveyor General of Queensland. Gregory Downs is a pastoral station which breeds cattle on of native grazing land. It carries approximately 30,000 Brahman cattle, a breed suitable for the Gulf Country. It has an frontage to the Gregory River. It was one of the first pastoral stations established in the Gulf Country.  History  Gregory Post Office opened on 2 May 1878 and closed in 1894. The Gregory Downs pastoral station was established in 1876 by the Watson brothers (Harry F. Watson, Sidney Grandison Watson and Robert McGregor Watson) who travelled overland with approximately 900 cattle. They liked the clear running water in the Gregory River and settled at a crossing point of the river with their cattle on the western bank and their homestead on the eastern bank. In the late 1800s they built the Gregory Downs Hotel and Store near the homestead (), but eventually decided that they found the travellers too much of a nuisance and so they relocated their homestead onto the western bank of the river (). There was a coach service from the hotel to Burketown. The hotel also served as a post for the mounted police. The town had a population of 40 people in 2008. In 2013, the town was renamed from Gregory Downs to Gregory.  Amenities  The Gregory branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association meets at various locations in the district.

Holmes of the Movies: The Screen Career of Sherlock Holmes. Bramhall House; 1st edition (1978). . Page 28. is a 1922 American silent mystery drama film starring John Barrymore as Sherlock Holmes and Roland Young as Dr. John Watson.The AFI Catalog of Feature Films: Sherlock Holmes The movie, which features the screen debuts of both William Powell (credited as William H. Powell) and Roland Young, was directed by Albert Parker. It was written by Earle Browne and Marion Fairfax from the 1899 play by William Gillette and Arthur Conan Doyle based upon Doyle's characters, and was produced by Goldwyn Pictures Corporation.Original first Broadway performance of William Gillette's play version, Sherlock Holmes , on which the 1916 Gillette and 1922 Barrymore films are based. The play produced by Charles Frohman opened at the Garrick Theatre on November 6, 1899 and ran to June 1900. Gillette revived the play numerous times over the years, according to the IBDb.com database The film was considered lost for decades, but was rediscovered in the mid-1970s and restored by George Eastman House. Plot Cambridge student Prince Alexis (Reginald Denny) is accused of stealing the athletic funds. Friend and fellow student Watson recommends he seek the assistance of classmate Sherlock Holmes. Meanwhile, while honing his observational skills out in the countryside, Holmes falls and is knocked unconscious. A young woman passerby, Alice Faulkner (Carol Dempster), comes to his aid, much to his delight. Holmes accepts the case, and soon has a suspect, Forman Wells (William H. Powell). Wells eventually confesses he took the money to try to get away from Moriarty (Gustav von Seyffertitz); Wells is actually the son of a crook being groomed by the criminal mastermind for some later scheme. Fascinated, Holmes meets Moriarty face to face, impudently asking to study him, but of course Moriarty refuses to cooperate. Holmes informs Watson he has found his mission in life: to stop Moriarty. Meanwhile, Alexis's uncle, Count von Stalburg (David Torrence), arrives with important news: both his brothers have been killed in a \\"motor accident\\". He is now the Crown Prince, and as such, cannot marry Rose Faulkner, Alice's sister. Heartbroken, Rose commits suicide. Years pass. Holmes is praised in a newspaper for solving a mystery that baffled Scotland Yard. His investigative skills have failed to locate Alice Faulkner, but their paths do cross again. Moriarty is after Rose Faulkner's love letters from the Prince for blackmail. He has had her destitute sister Alice hired as a secretary by \\"G. Neville Chetwood\\", actually a henchman named James Larrabee (Anders Randolf). When the Prince asks Holmes to take the case, he initially refuses, as he holds the Prince responsible for Rose's death, but changes his mind when he learns that Alice is involved. Holmes has Forman Wells infiltrate the Larrabee household as the new butler. Through trickery, Holmes gets Alice to reveal where she has hidden the letters, but oddly, once he has them in his hands, returns them to her, even though she intends to publish them to avenge her sister. He informs Watson that the letters will be the bait to lure Moriarty out of his lair. For his part, Moriarty has become frustrated at being driven further and further underground by Holmes' relentless pursuit of him. He has Alice brought to a \\"gas chamber\\" (where he has disposed of others). Holmes walks knowingly into the trap, but manages to rescue Alice anyway. Moriarty then sets his entire vast organization in motion to try to kill his nemesis. Holmes is up to the challenge, however. Most of Moriarty's henchmen are captured by the police, and when Moriarty comes in person (in disguise) to do the job, Holmes nabs him too. Holmes then plans his honeymoon with Alice.

Everson (aided in the early stages by director Albert Parker himself, then in his late 80s), with a second reconstruction (incorporating newly found elements) undertaken by Eastman House itself in 2001. Describing the first reconstruction attempt in 1975, Everson made it clear that reassembling the available material into a viewable form was a far from trivial task: \\"A few years ago all that existed of this film were rolls and rolls of negative sections, in which every take-- not every sequence, but every take--were [sic] jumbled out of order, with only a few flash titles\\"When the titles were made locally, the films were exported with flash titles, titles of just a few frames, and the distributor could insert the (local language) titles on the place where the flash title appeared.\\" Restoration of Motion Picture Film, ed.

It was first performed in France under that name at the Theatre Antione. An English version was staged on Broadway in 1961‚Äì62 with the title A Shot in the Dark, adapted by Harry Kurnitz and directed by Harold Clurman. The cast included Julie Harris, Walter Matthau, and William Shatner as an incompetent Examining Magistrate. Matthau's performance earned him a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play. When adapted to film in 1964, it was extensively rewritten in order to replace the Examining Magistrate with the inept police Inspector Clouseau, played by Peter Sellers, who had earlier originated the character in The Pink Panther.Blake Edwards DVD director's commentary, The Pink Panther (1964), MGM Movie Legends DVD release 2007 Plot The plot concerns a free- spirited, guileless and amoral young woman, Josefa (Julie Harris in the original Broadway production), who works as a maid in the home of one of the most prominent and influential families in France. She was discovered in her bedroom, naked and unconscious, with the body of her Spanish lover Miguel across the room and the gun that killed him by her side. As the play begins, she is being brought before the Examining Magistrate to determine if there is enough evidence to take her to trial where, under the French legal system she will be considered guilty unless proven innocent. The Examining Magistrate, Paul Sevigne (William Shatner), is handling his first case since being promoted to Paris from the provinces. Before the case begins we learn he has an ambitious wife who adores living in Paris; she wants Paul to go along with whatever his bosses want him to do so they don't get sent back to the boondocks. Paul also gets a visit from his boss who advises him to \\"get a quick confession\\" and bundle Josefa off to prison to avoid inconveniencing her wealthy banker boss, Benjamin Beaurevers (Walter Matthau). When he interviews Josefa, she tries to confess to the crime, changing her story every time Paul brings up evidence that contradicts her statements. By the end of the first act, Paul realizes Josefa is lying to protect someone else. He confides to his clerk Morestan (Gene Saks) the disastrous news: Josefa is innocent. There is an amusing bit in Act One in which Paul tells Josefa he wants to re-enact the crime \\"exactly as it happened\\". Josefa starts taking off her clothes, since she was naked when the shooting occurred, thinking that's what Paul means by \\"exactly\\". She is amused by the shocked reaction of Paul and Morestan when they notice her undressing. The rest of the play involves Paul unraveling the mystery while ruffling the feathers of his superiors, incurring the wrath of his wife, and dealing with Josefa's obstinate attempts to protect her other lover (besides Miguel). Eventually, Paul learns the mystery lover is none other than her employer Beaurevers. A running comic bit involves the fact that Josefa seldom wears underpants and tends to trip over things, exposing her bare derri√®re; she relates that this is how her affairs with both men began. When Beaurevers learns Paul knows about Josefa not wearing panties he quips, \\"I must say, your examinations are extremely thorough.\\" Eventually the mystery is solved, the murderer revealed and Paul is considered a hero for fighting for the underdog. Josefa offers Paul her favors for helping her, but he thanks her and declines. The play ends with Paul sending Josefa back out into the world with instructions to find a nice guy and settle down.

Raised in Wisconsin, he was the first major abstract painter to gain notoriety from the state. Harold Rosenberg described Holty as \\"a figure of our art history,\\" known for his use of color, shape and form. Personal life and education Carl Holty was born in 1900 in Freiburg, Germany. His parents, Americans, lived in Freiburg while his father, a doctor, studied specialty medicine since 1899. His father was German, gaining citizenship in the United States in 1906. Shortly after his birth the family moved back to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where they lived in the German district with his grandparents. The Holty family then moved to the countryside near Green Bay where his father practiced medicine, before returning to Milwaukee around 1906. Holty's grandfather introduced him to art by taking him to visit local art galleries. Around the age of twelve, Holty began taking lessons with a local German painter. As a teenager he started drawing cartoons and became interested in poster art. He attended Milwaukee University School, graduating high school within two and a half years. In 1919 he went to Marquette University, then joining the Reserve Officers' Training Corps during World War I, with the program ending within the same year. Back in college, he experimented with medicine only to tell his father on a visit home that he wanted to attend art school. That summer he enrolled at the Art Institute of Chicago, eventually attending classes at the Parsons School of Design. He returned to Milwaukee in 1923 and opened a portrait painting studio. In 1925 Holty married and honeymooned in Europe, living there for the next ten years, first in Munich and then Switzerland. In Switzerland Mrs. Holty sought treatment for her tuberculosis, dying in 1930. He moved to Paris that year, before returning to the United States in 1935 and living in New York City. In New York he remarried Elizabeth and they had a daughter Antonia. He taught at Brooklyn College from 1950 until 1970. During that time he also was a visiting instructor at the Art Students League, Washington University in St. Louis, and University of Louisville. Upon his retirement from Brooklyn College he was awarded the title of Professor Emeritus. Holty died on March 22, 1973, in New York City. Artistic career Bread and Fruit, oil on Masonite painting by Carl Holty, 1948, private collection In 1926, while living in Munich, Holty originally planned to attend the Royal Academy, only to train under Hans Hofmann. Hofmann's ideas about space, color, and shape would transform Holty's work, with Holty's work becoming more abstract as time went on. > \\"No one had ever talked to me about conceptual drawing, about knowing what > I'm looking at from the point of view of my tactile knowledge as well as my > visual knowledge. Hofmann did. And the world opened up just like that.\\" >  Carl Holty on Hans Hofmann's influence From 1930 to 1935 he lived in Paris, exhibiting his work to good reception. There he met Robert Delaunay and joined Delaunay's group Abstration-Cr√©ation. His work was published in the group's magazine and became associated with Cubism and Neo-Plasticism. His Paris works have been compared to the paintings of Juan Gris and Pablo Picasso's Synthetic Cubism. Upon returning to the United States, he found artist representation in New York City and became involved, once again, with Hans Hofmann and Vaclav Vytlacil as well as Stuart Davis, whom he had known in Paris. Vytlacil invited Holty to participate in discussions which led to the formation of the American Abstract Artists, which Holty would eventually come to chair, retaining his membership until 1944. During this time, he moved away from Cubism and started to experiment with Biomorphism. In the 1930s he used tape to give strong edges to forms, also reworking and overpainting sections, as seen in his work Gridiron (1943‚Äì1944). Between 1945 and 1948 he was represented by the Samuel M. Kootz Gallery. He continued to explore shapes and form, and by the 1960s contours had disappeared from his work, being replaced with subtle toned-down colors. Holty served as artist in residence at Georgia State University, University of Florida, University of California at Berkeley, University of Wisconsin and the Corcoran School of Art. He also wrote a book, with Romare Bearden, titled The Painter's Mind, published in 1969. Legacy and reception Untitled, oil on Masonite painting by Carl Holty, c.1942, private collection In 1977 the Carl Holty Papers were donated to the Archives of American Art by Charles Byrne. On his role as a Wisconsin artist, Andrew Stevens stated in 1995 that \\"Holty's zeal for non-objective art was more closely identified with the younger group of American painters in the East. His artworks including his prints are among the first by a Wisconsin artist to come to grips with the tide of abstract art that spread from Europe to America at the beginning of the 20th century.\\" Selected works *Gridiron, 1943‚Äì1944; Smithsonian American Art Museum *Untitled, 1939; Amon Carter Museum *Untitled, 1950; Kemper Art Museum *Untitled, series, 1951; Brooklyn Museum Notable exhibitions *Carl Holty: The World Seen and Sensed, 1980‚Äì81; Milwaukee Art Museum *Annual Exhibition of Contemporary Painting, 1945; Whitney Museum of American Art *American Painting Today, 1950; Metropolitan Museum of Art *Abstract Painting and Sculpture in America, 1951; Museum of Modern Art *Contemporary American Painting and Sculpture, 1963; Krannert Art Museum References Further reading *Kaplan, Patricia.

Sphenacanthus probably hunts small fishes and, unlike their modern-day relatives, its inhabited fresh water lagoons. Sphenacanthus had seven fins, two in the upper part and five in the underside, and it have a heterodont dentition and mandibles relatively long and deeper. Sphenacanthus serrulatus is still only known from incomplete neurocranial remains and associated dermal material. These suggest that it was a relatively large shark,probably well over one meter in length when fully grown. Its body form was probably similar to that of other phalacanthous sharks.JOHN R. F.

Another findings, like those of the Puertollano Bason in Spain suggests that also it lived in zones of marine influence, in brackish waters. It shared its environment with other primitive sharks, including to Xenacanthus of one meter in length and the similar species, Tristychius arcuatus. It is possible that Sphenacanthus may have preyed on its smaller relatives.  References   Further reading  * Chahud, A.; Fairchild, T.R. & Petri, S. 2010.

Construction Interdictor (YAGR-13) was laid down on 18 May 1945, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 3142, as the Liberty Ship Edwin H. Duff, by J.A. Jones Construction, Panama City, Florida. She was launched 29 June 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Edwin S. Duff; and delivered 27 July 1945, to the McCormack Steamship Co.. Service history She carried aircraft until entering the James River Reserve Fleet, Lee Hall, Virginia, 17 October 1945. Except for brief cargo service, she remained there until being acquired by the US Navy, 10 May 1957. She was converted to a radar picket ship at the Charleston Navy Yard, Charleston, South Carolina, and commissioned Interdictor (YAGR-13), 7 April 1958, Lieutenant Commander Joseph Palmer Dordahl, USNR, in command. Fitted with the latest and best electronic search and tracking equipment, Interdictor sailed 2 May 1958, for shakedown training in the Caribbean. She departed Charleston, 18 July 1958, and sailed to her new home port, San Francisco, California. Arriving 13 August, the ship assumed her role as an ocean radar station ship, part of America's vast early warning defense system. Operating with search aircraft, Interdictor could detect, track, and report enemy aircraft at great distances, supplementing land-based radar stations, and controlling high-speed interceptor aircraft in case of attack. She also carried out weather reporting duties during her three to four week cruises in the Pacific Ocean. Interdictors hull classification was changed 28 September 1958, to AGR-13. She continued on radar picket patrols for the Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD) out of San Francisco, until decommissioned 5 August 1965.

It is used primarily in the treatment of urinary tract infections, and has also been used to treat typhoid and paratyphoid fever. Because mecillinam has very low oral bioavailability, an orally active prodrug was developed: pivmecillinam. Medical uses Mecillinam is used in the treatment of infections due to susceptible gram- negative bacteria, especially urinary tract infections which are most commonly caused by Escherichia coli. Mecillinam is active against most pathogenic Gram- negative bacteria, except Pseudomonas aeruginosa and some species of Proteus. Retrieved on August 31, 2008. Freely available with registration. Several studies have also found it to be as effective as other antibiotics for treating Staphylococcus saprophyticus infection, though it is Gram-positive, possibly because mecillinam reaches very high concentrations in urine. Worldwide resistance to mecillinam in bacteria causing urinary tract infection has remained very low since its introduction; a 2003 study conducted in 16 European countries and Canada found resistance to range from 1.2% (Escherichia coli) to 5.2% (Proteus mirabilis). Another large study conducted in Europe and Brazil obtained similar results ‚Äî 95.9% of E. coli strains, for instance, were sensitive to mecillinam. Adverse effects The adverse effect profile of mecillinam is similar to that of other penicillins. Its most common side effects are rash and gastrointestinal upset, including nausea and vomiting.

If the user later visits the target website and completes a qualifying transaction (such as making a purchase), the cookie stuffer is paid a commission by the target. Because the stuffer has not actually encouraged the user to visit the target, this technique is considered illegitimate by many affiliate schemes. Process Websites that run an affiliate program pay a commission to affiliates for introducing visitors who then complete one or more qualifying transactions. Other website owners often join affiliate programs to earn the commission, usually by simply sending visitors to the site running the affiliate program via a special link or advertisement. When the user clicks this special link, a single cookie is usually placed on a user's computer. This is considered normal practice; it's the way that affiliate marketers generate genuine income. By definition, cookies can only be considered to be stuffed when one or more is placed on a user's computer purely as a result of viewing a page, or more than one is added at a time as a result of a single click. Taken to the extreme dozens of cookies can be stuffed in a scattergun approach in the hope that the user will visit one of the several target affiliate sites and complete a qualifying transaction. Cookie stuffing is often referred to as a blackhat online marketing technique. This not only has the potential to generate fraudulent affiliate income for the cookie stuffer, but may also overwrite legitimate affiliate cookies, essentially stealing the commission from another affiliate. It is perfectly normal for a user to visit a website, click on a link and be directed to a target affiliate site but not complete a qualifying transaction at that time. That user may revisit the target affiliate website at some later time and complete a qualifying transaction. The original referring affiliate would be credited with the transaction and make a commission. However, many affiliate programs award the commission to the most recent referring affiliate, not the original referring affiliate. The problem occurs when a cookie stuffing site stuffs all its visitors with a batch of cookies in a scattergun approach. The genuine affiliate cookie may get overwritten and when the user visits the target affiliate site and completes a qualifying transaction, the cookie stuffer gets the credit instead of the original affiliate who had brought about the first genuine visit to the target site. User-generated content Operators of websites that allow user- generated content, such as forums that allow users to post content, should be aware of the various cookie stuffing techniques, and how to combat them, in order to protect their visitors from this type of activity. Cookie stuffing can be accomplished with something as simple as including an image in a forum post or signature. The image link is compromised on purpose by the cookie stuffer and made to simulate a click by forum visitors on an affiliate link. Techniques Techniques used to accomplish cookie stuffing are very similar to those used in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. Pop-ups Pop- ups are actually a method of cookie stuffing accepted by most affiliate networks. The pop-up gets the website visitor to visit your site and of course gives them an affiliate cookie. The most common place to find this happening is on review sites where the affiliate ‚Äúreviews‚Äù a product. Companies pay a commission for customers that were interested in their product, but still wanted more information before purchasing. This is probably the most innocent form of cookie stuffing, but is still stuffing none-the-less. This method can be defeated by utilizing pop-up blocking software. Frames and iframes Iframes are a way of embedding a page within a page. A webmaster embeds a web page with one simple line of code. The affiliate embeds an iframe onto their page that loads their affiliate URL. Frames work in a similar fashion. Frames have been deprecated in modern browsers, so such techniques are no longer prevalent. Images The \`\` HTML tag suggests to a browser to attempt to retrieve an image at any URL. It doesn't matter if the URL supplied doesn't have an extension like \\".jpg\\", \\".gif\\", or \\".png\\" at the end. For instance, \`![](http://google.com)\` would actually get anyone that visits that page to send a visit to Google. Affiliate links can be put in directly or by creating a redirect in their .htaccess. JavaScript JavaScript can be used to force a user to visit any URL where the end result is visiting the affiliate URL. Stylesheets Cascading Style Sheets define how a web page will be displayed. They are retrieved just like an image would be ‚Äì the browser is instructed to visit a URL. The affiliate could put the direct affiliate URL into the style sheet as an image and have it loaded that way. This is one of the harder methods to detect. Flash Adobe Flash is commonly used to create interactive media on the web, and contains functionality which allows developers to force a website user to visit an affiliate link while removing or spoofing the referrer information so that the affiliate network won't know where the traffic came from. A common tactic is to have the spoofed referring site be a legitimate or white hat affiliate site to mask the fact that cookie stuffing is being carried out. Legal issues In 2008, eBay sued four successful affiliate marketers on their platform who had used cookie stuffing techniques. Brian Dunning, host of the Skeptoid podcast was sentenced to fifteen months in prison and a $100 fine, the other to five months in prison and a $25,000 fine after pleading guilty to wire fraud.

Several weeks later, she visits Dev's apartment to discuss business matters on her father's behalf. It is evident that there was an attraction between the pair. They are interrupted by a jealous Nina who warns Dev to stay away from her daughter. After Nina leaves, Tara tries to kiss Dev but he rejects her, leaving Tara embarrassed. Tara invites Dev to her house after asking for Prem's consent to the relationship. The two ware about to share a kiss when Prem and Nina walk in. Dev is forced to end his relationship with Tara after he admits to Prem that he had been sleeping with Nina, as Prem and Dev agreed that Tara would not know of the affair. However, Tara reconciles with Dev and they resume their relationship. Tara later discovers that her ex- boyfriend had been having a fling with her mother while they were together. Further heartbreak follows when Dev's daughter Amber (Nikki Patel) exposes Dev and Nina's affair, which results in the end of their relationship. On Boxing Day 2008, Amber sets Dev and Tara up on a date in The Rovers Return Inn, Amber tells Tara she has relationship problems with Darryl Morton (Jonathan Dixon) and that she wants advice, whilst telling Dev she wants a drink. Dev sells Tara the corner shop flat, as it is empty and Tara needs accommodation. She gladly accepts. Tara gives Amber a car as a belated birthday present. However, Dev is against this. Amber is offered a job by Darryl, so she can pay for driving lessons. In March 2009, Dev refits one of his shops as a new art gallery for Tara and she launches it with the name No Oil Painting. Dev's uncle Umed (Harish Patel) voices concern that Tara is taking advantage of Dev's money and even suspects her of having a fling with Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas), who is working on the refit. Tara begins to be dismayed when it becomes apparent that there is little interest in her new venture as nobody is buying her painting. Keen to please her, Dev has Minnie Chandra (Poppy Jhakra) to pose as a London art dealer who is interested in purchasing some work. Tara discovers Dev that has purchased the art after Minnie brings the art into the shop and she leaves, humiliated that Dev had made a fool of her. After her departure, Dev has a one-night stand with old flame Lisa Dalton (Ruth Alexander Rubin). To Dev's horror, Tara returns to the flat the following day to say how sorry she was, not knowing that Lisa was in the bedroom. Dev and Lisa's night of passion is revealed to Tara by Poppy Morales (Sophiya Haque). Tara, disgusted, plans her revenge, tricking Dev into posing naked at a photoshoot. Tara unveils to the whole of Weatherfield the nude picture of Dev with the word 'LIAR' censoring him. Dev, who planned to propose to her that same day, argues with Tara in the flat before she packs her bags and leaves. Tara attempts to apologise to Amber, whom she is very fond of, but Amber refuses to listen.

The General Problem Solver (GPS) is a particular computer program created in 1957 by Herbert Simon, J. C. Shaw, and Allen Newell intended to work as a universal problem solver, that theoretically can be used to solve every possible problem that can be formalized in a symbolic system, given the right input configuration. It was the first computer program which separated its knowledge of problems (in the form of domain rules) from its strategy of how to solve problems (as a general search engine). General solvers typically use an architecture similar to the GPS to decouple a problem's definition from the strategy used to solve it. The advantage in this decoupling is that the solver doesn't depend on the details of any particular problem instance. The strategy utilized by general solvers was based on a general algorithm (generally based on backtracking) with the only goal of completeness. This induces an exponential computational time that dramatically limits their usability. Modern solvers use a more specialized approach, which takes advantage of the structure of the problems that the solver aims to spend as little time as possible backtracking. For problems of a particular class (e.g., systems of non-linear equations) there are usually a wide range of different algorithms available; sometimes a solver implements multiple algorithms, but sometimes just one.

Morley, ed., The Plays and Poems of William Heminge, Madison, NJ, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2006.William Heminges, The Fatal Contract, Anne Elizabeth Chard Hargrove, ed., Kalamazoo, MI, Medieval Institute Publications, University of Michigan Press, 1978. The play has been regarded as one of the most extreme of the revenge tragedies or \\"tragedies of blood,\\" like The Spanish Tragedy and Titus Andronicus, that constitute a distinctive subgenre of English Renaissance theatre. In this \\"most graphic Caroline revenge tragedy...Heminges tops his predecessors' grotesque art by creating a female character, Chrotilda, who disguises herself as a black Moorish eunuch\\" and \\"instigates most of the play's murder and mayhem.\\"Virginia Mason, Performing Blackness on English Stages, 1500‚Äì1800,Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2005; pp. 121‚Äì2. Performance and publication The Fatal Contract was most likely written in the 1638‚Äì39 period, and was acted, probably in the latter year, by Queen Henrietta's Men at the Salisbury Court Theatre. Heminges's primary source for plot materials was the General Inventory of the History of France by Jean de Serres, published in English in 1607.Mason, p. 121. The play was first printed in 1653, in a quarto issued by the actor turned stationer Andrew Pennycuicke. (The edition's preface is co- signed by \\"A. T.,\\" thought to be Anthony Turner.) The booksellers dedicated the play to the Earl and Countess of Nottingham. The prefatory matter in that edition indicates that Heminges was deceased by 1653. A second edition followed in 1661 from bookseller Richard Gammon. During the Restoration, Elkanah Settle adapted Heminges's play into his Love and Revenge (1675). The original 1653 text was reprinted in 1687 under the alternative title The Eunuch. Shakespearean influence Among the writers of the later Jacobean and the Caroline eras, Heminges was perhaps the one most deeply influenced by the works of Shakespeare. The Fatal Contract is thick with borrowings from Shakespeare's works.Joseph Quincy Adams, Jr., \\"William Heminges and Shakespeare,\\" Modern Philology, Vol. 12 No. 1 (May 1914), pp. 51‚Äì64. The play shows particularly intense linkages with Hamlet, Othello, and King Lear, and commonalities with other works in Shakespeare's canon. The play's verbal echoes of Shakespeare are too numerous to detail. One example may stand for the rest: for Clotair's \\"And rise black vengeance from the depth of hell,\\" compare Othello's \\"Arise, black vengeance, from the hollow hell!\\" in Othello, III,3,447. For Fredigond stabbing her portrait, compare Lucrece attacking a portrait with her nails in The Rape of Lucrece, lines 1562‚Äì68; rage and a rape context are common to both. Stabbed portraits also can be found in the plays The Noble Spanish Soldier (printed 1634) and James Shirley's The Traitor (acted 1631, printed 1635).Fredson Bowers, \\"The Stabbing of a Portrait in Elizabethan Tragedy,\\" Modern Language Notes, Vol. 47 No. 6 (June 1932), pp. 378‚Äì85. Blackface \\"By 1638 the disguised Moor had become a theatrical convention.\\"Mason, p. 122. Richard Brome's The English Moor (c. 1637), almost contemporaneous with Heminges's play, is a noteworthy example. Synopsis The Fatal Contract is set in the earliest period of the French monarchy. Childerick is king; Fredigond, his wife and queen, is the play's villainess; Clotair and Clovis are their sons. In the play's backstory, Clotair raped Chrotilda, the sister of two young noblemen named Lamot and Dumain (the play's virtuous characters). One of their relatives mistakenly killed the queen's brother Clodimer in revenge, thinking him the rapist; Fredigond is now quietly and systematically exterminating the members of Chrotilda's family. In a macabre touch, the queen maintains a group portrait of the family; she paints in the members ‚Äì grandmother, parents, infant child ‚Äì as she kills them off. (In a sudden frenzy of rage, Fredigond stabs the painting.) The queen is assisted in her villainy by a Moorish eunuch called, with brutal literateness, Castrato. Childerick is poisoned by Fredigond; Lamot and Dumain are blamed for the death, but manage to escape. The prince Clovis is in love with Aphelia, and she with him; but his elder brother, and now king, Clotair is envious. Castrato helps Clotair plan Aphelia's rape. Clovis intercepts his brother; as they fight, Castrato raises an alarm and their mother Fredigond arrives. Rather than trying to stop the fight, she eggs them on. Clotair stabs Clovis, who is carried off, presumably dead. Ferdigond and her lover Landrey are in her chamber; Castrato sets the room on fire, but the queen disguises her lover as the ghost of Clovis. Fredigond plans to rule the kingdom with Landrey once Clotair, Clovis, and Aphelia are dead. She wants Clotair to execute Aphelia, to placate Clovis's \\"ghost.\\" Clotair initially falls for the trick, but Castrato, who is busily manipulating the other characters (\\"on all sides the eunuch will play foul\\"), informs him of the queen's intentions. Clotair responds by marrying Aphelia instead of killing her. Lamot, disguised as a surgeon, has discovered that the wounded Clovis is still alive. Clovis masquerades as the ghost of his father Childerick, and terrifies the queen into admitting that she poisoned her husband. Clovis turns Fredigond and Landrey over to Castrato, who starves the imprisoned queen and her paramour, then poisons them. Landrey tries to escape with a concealed dagger; but in his weakened state he is unable to evade Castrato, who trips him, sits on him, and stabs him. Castrato has convinced Clotair that Aphelia has been unfaithful to him; Clotair binds his wife and Castrato tortures her (he \\"sears her breast\\"). Castrato displays the corpses of Fredigond and Landrey, and Clotair understands that Aphelia is innocent and that he has been abused. Clotair stabs Castrato, who, dying, reveals her true identity as Chrotilda. Lamot and Dumain break into the castle with a party of supporters. The play's conclusion indicates that Clotair, Aphelia, and Chrotilda will die and that Clovis will inherit the throne.

Jackson, USN, History of the Advanced Base (May 15, 1913) and The Naval Advanced Base (May 29, 1915); Subject File 408, Records of the General Board. * General Board to SecNav, \\"Letter to the Secretary of the Navy (LSSN)\\"; August 13, 1906. * General Board memo; May 29, 1915. Established in the beginning of the 20th century, the Advanced Base Force was the United States' first combined task force built on the concept of the Marine Corps' traditional role in expeditionary warfare. The slow development of the advanced base force played a significant role in the controversy over the removal of the ships' guards (Marines on Navy ships) in 1908‚Äì1909.Millett, Allan R., Semper Fidelis: The History of the United States Marine Corps, (New York: The Free Press, 1991). Relying on the full projection capabilities of their naval counterparts, the Advanced Base Force enabled the United States Navy to meet all the demands for its use of naval services within its own sphere of maritime operations. It also allowed operational independence, without the cooperation of the United States Army for troops and military supplies, as such a force might not be available. The General Board had concluded that one or two regiments of the Advanced Base Force were more than adequate to defend naval bases against cruiser raids, and were also able to land with thirty emplaced naval guns, high-angle field artillery, machine guns, infantry, and water and land minefields. The Advanced Base Force is the ancestor of today's Fleet Marine Force. Background Before the creation of the Advanced Base Force, the victory over Spain in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War had greatly influenced the expansion of the United States. By the time the Treaty of Paris was ratified in 1898 the United States had annexed the Philippines in the western Pacific to influence foreign relations in China and Korea; primarily through the presence of the Asiatic Squadron. United States territories under the administration of President William McKinley included GuamPaul Carano and Pedro C. Sanchez, A Complete History of Guam, (Rutland, VT: C. E. Tuttle Co., 1964). and the Hawaiian Islands, also extending to the south Pacific insular areas of Samoa. Also, Congress approved the Foraker Act for the annexation of Puerto Rico for the defense and protection of the newly independent Cuba from any possible foreign attack. The government also negotiated with Nicaragua and Colombia for the right to build an isthmian canal, eventually through Panama. Due to the new, vast expansion of territory, the Navy began to assume strategic duties unimagined before 1898. In 1900, the \\"General Board of the Navy\\" was established to foresee and make recommendations on naval policy, assuming the tasks of the nation's naval expeditionary and strategic challenges.William M. McBride, Technological Change and the United States Navy, 1865‚Äì1945, (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000). The General Board developed some potential war plans for possible events that might occur if attacks were to be made against the continental east coast, the Antilles of the Caribbean, or the Panama Canal. The most dangerous likely foe that the United States Navy faced was the British Royal Navy, which had been included in War Plan Red;Floyd W. Rudmin, Bordering on Aggression: Evidence of U.S. Military Preparations Against Canada, (Nashville, TN: Voyageur Publishing Co., May 1993). however, relations had improved and both already committed to a growing rapprochement. The Board instead agreed that the most likely foe would be Germany's Imperial Navy, a burgeoning force of warships that were at the disposal of Emperor Wilhelm II. In response to possible German naval invasion of the Caribbean or attacks on the east coast, the United States devised War Plan Black.Michael Lind, The American Way of Strategy: US Foreign Policy and the American Way of Life, (Oxford, NY: Oxford University Press, 2006) This plan also dealt with Germany having purchased Spain's remaining Central Pacific island colonies, with the Mariana Islands and the Caroline Islands, and its establishment of a naval base in China in 1900. Also, after the Russo-Japanese War, victorious Imperial Japan had serious plans of expanding its influence south and east in the Pacific. The United States Navy solely relied on the Pacific islands as refueling stations for the coal-powered navy ships; the lifeline to the naval bases in the Philippines and Guam. If such an attack was initiated by the Japanese, a system of Pacific naval bases needed to be built in order to put War Plan Orange (a response to a Japanese attack on the Philippines) into effect.Seward W. Livermore, \\"American Naval Base Policy in the Far East\\", Pacific Historical Review; 13, pgs. 113‚Äì135. To sum it up, the Navy's war planning after 1900 assumed that maritime attacks on the United States and its interests were possible in both the Pacific and the Caribbean. Given the thousands of miles the fleet would have to steam to provide security to the outermost bases of Guam, the Philippines, etc., the General Board was convinced that it would require hastily developed advanced bases, and it could not depend on the small and overextended United States Army to defend the bases in short order. Definitive history In late 1901 a four-company battalion was formed at Annapolis and Newport by then-Commandant of the Marine Corps Major General Charles Heywood for expeditionary and advanced base training. General Heywood had been pressured by both the General Board and Secretary of the Navy, John D. Long, to create such a force that was to be placed on naval transport and well-drilled and equipped for duties given at short notice in any of the territories annexed by the United States, without relying on the slower and more demanding process of deploying the Army.Commandant Col. Charles Heywood to Representative E. Foss, December 12, 1898, HQMC, \\"Letters Sent, 1884‚Äì1911\\"; Record Group 127, National Archives and Administration. Organization The Advanced Base Force was \\"officially\\" created on 23 December 1913 by Commandant William P. Biddle and was designated as the 1st Advanced Base Brigade, the lineal forebearer of the 1st Marine Division.1st Marine Division: Lineage http://www.1stmardiv.marines.mil/About/Lineage/ Retrieved May 6, 2017 Briefly, two regiments were designated as the Fixed Defense Regiment and the Mobile Defense Regiment. They both are forebears of Marine regiments that exist today; the 1st Regiment of the Advanced Base Force subsequently became the 2nd Marine Regiment, whereas the 2nd Regiment became the 1st Marine Regiment. An aviation detachment had been established a few years before in 1911, under command of the United States' sixth naval aviator, Lieutenant Bernard L. Smith. This detachment is not to be confused with the 1917 \\"permanent\\" Aviation Company, which was under command of the United States' fifth naval (and the Marine Corps' first) aviator, Marine officer Alfred A. Cunningham. =Fixed Defense Regiment= On 19 June 1913, the Fixed Defense Regiment, under command of Lieutenant Colonel Charles G. Long, was formed at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. The Fixed Defense Regiment was the forerunner of the Marine Defense Battalions that were responsible for coastal defense of various naval bases throughout the Pacific during World War II.Simmons, Edwin H., The United States Marines: A History, (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 1974). On 3 January 1914, the Fixed Defense Regiment at Culebra Island, Puerto Rico, along with the Mobile Defense Force, formed the Advanced Base Force Brigade, under the command of Colonel George Barnett, who had commanded the Marine Barracks at the Philadelphia Navy Yard and the Advanced Base School. By 18 February 1914, it was redesignated as the 1st Regiment, Advanced Base Brigade. For the next two months, the regiment operated on board ship off New Orleans and Algiers, Louisiana. In 1915, the regiment consisted of: * Headquarters company * C Company, the minelaying company trained to handle harbor defense mines. * E Company, the signal company trained in radio, telephone, telegraph, buzzers, and visual signalling. * F and I Companies were responsible for the fixed batteries to be mounted in harbor defense. * H Company which was trained both as a combat engineer company and as a heavy automatic weapons company * a field artillery battery which manned field pieces The Aviation Company was established by Alfred A. Cunningham at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 26 February 1917. The company's strength consisted of ten officers and forty men in billets as aviators and as staff personnel. The Advanced Base Force's aviation company became the first permanent aviation element in the Marine Corps. =Mobile Defense Regiment= Commandant Biddle assembled the Mobile Defense Regiment at the Pensacola Navy Yard from the expeditionary battalions that had been stationed abroad in Mexican territorial waters; Commandant Biddle assigned Lieutenant Colonel John A. Lejeune as the commanding officer. The regiment was composed of four rifle companies, a machine gun company, and a field gun battery. These were divided into mobile infantry/artillery battalion landing forces, the predecessors to the Marine Regimental (RLT) and Battalion Landing Teams (BLT) that performed numerous landing operations from the Pacific Theater of World War II, to the Korean War, Vietnam War, and later years. Between 2‚Äì3 January 1914, the Mobile Defense Regiment sailed aboard USS Prairie and rendezvoused with the Fixed Base Regiment at Culebra Island, Puerto Rico, forming the Advanced Base Force Brigade, the first operational unit of this size and type. Institution =1900‚Äì1905= A brilliant intelligence officer, U.S. Marine Captain Dion Williams, who was serving in the Office of Naval Intelligence, wrote an extensive thesis in 1902 stressing that U.S. safety rested on the U.S. Navy's ability to coal its vessels in time of war. He endorsed that any war the United States will enter in the future should first be conceived as a \\"naval war\\". Williams, however, differentiated between fixed and mobile defense forces. He announced that the fixed defense force should be a permanent regiment of 1,312 Marines to man artillery and establish necessary minefields and barriers; the mobile defense force should be a regiment of two infantry battalions and one field artillery battery, which could be formed quickly from Marine naval base detachments. He urged stockpiling equipment and weapons, assigning transport permanently to the force, and holding annual maneuvers.Williams, Dion, Report on Men, Material, and Drills Required for Establishing a Naval Advanced Base, November 2, 1909; GB File 408. In the summer of 1902, Secretary of the Navy William H. Moody ordered an advanced base force battalion to be prepared for an upcoming fleet exercises that winter in the Caribbean Islands. This exercise proved to the Marine Corps the necessity of naval gun emplacement and setting up base defenses. Also, the expeditionary battalion that was stationed in Cavite, Philippines had already been exercising in Subic Bay and had employed eight heavy guns at the bay's entrance.Captain G. C. Thorpe to Major H. C. Haines, April 25, 1902, \\"Historical Division Letters Received\\", Record Group 127, National Archives and Administration.Report of the Secretary of the Navy 1903, Miscellaneous Reports, Bureau of Navigation, pp. 651-660 Even though the battalion in the Philippines was not formally part of the advanced base force concept, it was marking a new ideal for the Marine Corps. The first advanced base exercises had taken place on Culebra, Puerto Rico in 1903, proving to the General Board how well the Marines could perform the ideals and concepts that were conceived. It opened many new perspectives for the future of the Marines; and it sparked a harsh chapter of interservice rivalry. The captain of USS Panther demanded that the Marines perform their duties as a ship's guard, including ship security and acting as a provost marshal to provide deterrence against mutiny. This act forcibly neglected the advanced base force battalion's training schedule and defense planning.Commander J. C. Wilson, to William H. Moody, Secretary of the Navy, \\"Letter to the Secretary of the Navy, dtd 5 March 1903.\\" GB File 432. Even ashore the naval officers had little understanding of the problems of moving heavy weaponry and equipment across broken terrain,Brigadier General George F. Elliot, Commandant of the Marine Corps, to William H. Moody, Secretary of the Navy, \\"Letter to the Secretary of the Navy, dtd 4 December 1903, HQMC.\\"; Report Group 127, National Archives. and the advanced base force languished by 1903 due to the large number of east coast Marines deployed to Panama and Cuba. Only then were the Marines in the Philippines included in the General Board's advanced base force concept. =1905‚Äì1910= In an exercise in 1907 at Subic Bay, a battalion commanded by Major Eli K. Cole emplaced forty-four heavy guns in a ten-week period due to the Eight-eight fleet war scare with Japan in 1907, which convinced the Navy Department that it should organize the mat√©riel for an advanced base force to be available in the Philippines, along with a well-prepared and trained force in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Marine Corps at the time recorded a strength increase of two thousand men since 1903, and the General Board considered it a favorable quota to proceed in organizing a \\"permanent\\" advanced base force; thus making further cooperation with the Army unnecessary. The General Board in 1909 reviewed the scant progress since 1900 and concluded that neither the Navy Department nor the Marine Corps had done much to make the advanced base force a reality. Commandant George F. Elliott and his staff were criticized by the Navy officers for not implementing former Commandant Charles Heywood's agreements. Admiral George Dewey expressed disappointment and Navy Commander William F. Fullam, a known opponent to the Marine Corps, took it upon himself to denounce Elliott for failure to use additional Marines for expeditionary duty, which was the only hope for naval reformers in creating the advanced base force.William F. Fullam's memos, 1909: * \\"The Executive Order Withdrawing Marines from Cruising Ships.\\" * \\"Summary of Evidence Concerning Withdrawal of Marines from Cruising Ships.\\" Several factors helped renew interest in the advanced base force. The most significant factor was the appointment in 1909 of a new Secretary of the Navy, George von L. Meyer, who created the Naval Aide system. Meyer's aides were four line officers with direct responsibilities for policy in four functional areas: operations, inspections, personnel, and mat√©riel. Secretary Meyer appointed Bradley A. Fiske as Aide for Operations and William Fullam as Aide for Inspections, the Marine Corps' own rival and nemesis, to staff these posts. The aides and the General Board improved policy matters and were very influential on behalf of war preparedness and establishing a balanced naval fleet. The Aide for Operations subsequently became the Chief of Naval Operations in 1915. Another factor was an increased number of men available for advanced base training due to the conflicts of the Nicaraguan Expedition of 1912 and the Veracruz landing in 1914. Importantly, Colonel William P. Biddle replaced General Elliott as the Commandant of the Marine Corps, who in turn approved three important reforms that strengthened the Corps' ability to respond to advanced base missions; one of which was the establishment of an assistant to the Commandant. The Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps was responsible for the military training and preparedness of the Marines. Lieutenant Colonel Eli K. Cole was the first to hold this office. Secondly, the creation of permanent expeditionary companies at each Marine Barracks. And thirdly, the institution of mandatory three months' recruit training for all Marine recruits. In addition, Biddle continued Elliott's policy of assigning a few Marine officers to Navy and Army advanced officer schools for further training in large unit maneuvers, artillery, communications, and contingency planning. =1910‚Äì1915= In March 1910 Assistant Secretary of the Navy Beekman Winthrop sent Commandant Biddle a direct order to take custody of the advanced base materiel and take the necessary steps to instruct officers and enlisted men in the use of this materiel. Assessing the related experiences through 1911, Marine Major Henry C. Davis argued that the advanced base force was the Corps' \\"true\\" mission and it should be embraced as such.Davis, Henry C., Advanced Base Training, (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 1911); U.S. Secretaries and Treasurers Philip R. Alger and W. B. Wells, Proceedings of the United States Naval Institute, Volume 37 (Baltimore, MD: The Lord Baltimore Press, 1911); pp. 95‚Äì99. By next summer, the Advanced Base School was transferred to the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Two new revolutions in the Marine Corps also helped established the legitimacy of the Advanced Base Force; the first was the formation of the Marine Corps Association (MCA) and the Marine Corps Gazette, founded by John A. Lejeune in 1911, and second, the new avenues for innovation of Marine and Naval Aviation.Craven, Thomas T., History of Aviation in the United States Navy, (1920); File ZGU, Subject File, 1911‚Äì1927, RG 45.

Smith, the Marine Corps' second aviator, both learned to fly planes from civilian instructors, and both later reported to the Advanced Base Force in 1913, to create an aviation section within the force. In June 1913 the Advanced Base Force brigade was formed, composed of two permanently organized regiments, the Fixed Defense Regiment and the Mobile Defense Regiment. Each regiment was tailored to its specific part in the advanced base force concept. At the same time, numerical designations for companies were adopted to alleviate the problem of having more than one company A, for example, in any units of an expeditionary force. On 23 December 1913, the brigade was redesignated as the 1st Advance Force Brigade, and again on 1 April 1914, as the 1st Brigade. The 1st Brigade was deactivated on 15 August 1934, after participating in the Occupation of Haiti from August 1915 until August 1934.1st Marine Division: Lineage. http://www.1stmardiv.marines.mil/About/Lineage/. Retrieved June 8, 2017. Despite the efforts in the creation of the Advanced Base School, too much energy had been spent on academic arguments over the advanced base concept; it was time to fully test the concept in fleet maneuvers. By December 1913, the Marine Corps had done more to make the advanced base force a reality in one year than it had in the last twelve years.William F. Biddle, Letter to the Secretary of the Navy (LSSN), (December 18, 1918); GB File 432. By 1914, the advanced base force included reconnaissance seaplanes. The fortunes of Marine aviation from its infancy were associated with advanced base operations.Edward C. Johnson and Graham A. Cosmas, A Short History of Marine Aviation, (HQMC, Washington, D.C.: History and Museums Division, 1976); pgs. 1‚Äì10. In July 1914, a Marine Colonel, Joseph Pendleton, encamped his Marines at the fairgrounds in Balboa Park in San Diego, CA. On 19 December 1914, he established a Marine Barracks in San Diego to house the advanced base/expeditionary forces. However, the status of a permanent base was debated in the federal government. In January 1915, about the time the Panama‚ÄìCalifornia Exposition opened at Balboa Park in San Diego, California, the Marine Corps received funding to develop its new bases on the west coast in San Diego, with a similar training base at Quantico, Virginia on the east coast. Also, the funding provided the necessary materiel to establish an aviation company of ten officers and forty men, which grew proportionally larger shortly thereafter, due to a reorganization allowing increased personnel strength ordered through the General Board and the Navy Department. After George Barnett became Commandant, Headquarters Marine Corps transferred the Advanced Base School [again] to Newport, Rhode Island, adding it to the Naval War College curriculum. This move became the fulcrum of the advanced base force's successful future, although it was not apparent at the time. The earliest scholars and missionaries of this concept at the Naval War College were Dion Williams, Eli K. Cole, John H. Russell, and Robert H. Dunlap, all of whom pioneered the advanced base force concept since the very beginning. A brilliant and well-decorated Marine intelligence officer, Lieutenant Colonel Earl H. Ellis, a fellow patron of the Navy War College in 1912‚Äì1913, was influenced by the advanced base operations concept. In his tenure as a student, and later as an instructor, he created a curriculum for and instrumented war plans and procedures that became vital to the success of the United States' Pacific island-hopping campaign that would occur 25 years later in World War II. He also plotted accurate charts, based on his ability in hydrographic surveying and topography; pointing out that seizing a well- defended island rested upon the integral advanced base force, and that the Marine Corps' future fully relied on the advanced base force, for both defense and assault. Ellis' brilliance even impressed John A. Lejeune, who soon became Ellis' patron as well as a coadvocate of the advanced base force concept. Ellis participated in drafting war plans against Japan that later became the vital major thesis on which the island-hopping campaign in the Pacific Theater during World War II was based. Ellis covertly spied on the Japanese, disguised as a civilian seeking business in Micronesia and surrounding islands. Also in 1915, Colonel Eli K. Cole continued his own advocacy the moment he was appointed as the Commandant of the Advanced Base School and the commander of the 1st Regiment (Fixed Defense), (ending his tenure as the first Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps, 1911‚Äî1915), by emphasizing the procurement of new weapons and equipment, plus the necessary technical training.Eli K. Cole, Advanced Base Force, lecture, (Philadelphia, PA: Marine Barracks, 19 June 1915); File 1975-10, HQMC, General Correspondence, 1911‚Äì1938, RG 127. Next to serve as the assistant to Commandant George Barnett was Colonel John A. Lejeune. During his tenure of 1915‚Äì1917, he spoke for the Commandant, stressing the missions of the Advanced Base Force. He argued that the Marine Corps' organization needed reconstructing, urging that the Marine Corps as a whole, not just particular regiments, be assigned to advanced base duty; this reorganization should be the Marine Corps' primary function in the United States' naval services. Col. Lejeune also supported the article printed in the Marine Corps Gazette by John H. Russell, who drafted one of the earliest advanced base force studies.Russell, John H., \\"A Plea for a Mission and Doctrine\\", Marine Corps Gazette (June 1916); pp. 109‚Äì122. The expeditionary duties in the Caribbean were among the main events that conflicted with the formation of a legitimate advanced base force that could be retained permanently to serve abroad at navy bases. In August 1914 World War I broke out in Europe, pitting the German, Austrian, and Turkish armies against the coalition of Great Britain, France, and Russia. After the American entry into World War I in April 1917, two Marine regiments, the 5th and 6th Marines with other units, were raised and trained to serve in France as half of the Army's 2nd Division. The Marines' battles of World War I in 1917‚Äì1919 would prove and test the Marine Corps' new creed of maritime combat. From 1900 through 1916, much had changed to evolve the old principle of \\"ship-only\\" duty as security guards, and the occasional landing force participants. Insomuch, the \\"advanced base force concept\\" had emplaced itself as the father of modern amphibious warfare, another concept that would revolutionize the Marine Corps in the years to follow. Operation =Veracruz, 1914= The Marine Corps's Advanced Base Force, and its Navy cooperatives, participated in the United States's next intervention when the late-President of Mexico Francisco Madero was executed by Victoriano Huerta's Porfirista military conspirators on 22 February 1913. 500 Marines of the 2nd Advanced Base Regiment were among the first to land at Veracruz, Mexico in April 1914 after the Tampico Affair. The aviation company with the Advanced Base Force, however, missed its first chance at expeditionary duty during this operation because it had not yet discovered a way to get its two aircraft, both seaplanes, to the objective area in flying condition. Training Advanced Base School The Advanced Base School was established at New London, Connecticut by the Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC) in April 1910.William Biddle, Commandant of the Marine Corps, to Beekman Winthrop, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Advanced Base Force; appendix C. GB File 432 (April 18, 1910). The General Board asked the Secretary of the Navy, George Meyer, to order the newly appointed Commandant of the Marine Corps, Colonel William P. Biddle, to assume responsibilities for the advanced base equipment assembled at Philadelphia and Subic Bay, Philippines. More or less, the Commandant was in charge of ensuring that all the officers and enlisted were adequately trained in the formal study of the advanced base force.William Biddle, Commandant of the Marine Corps, to George von Lengerke Meyer, Secretary of the Navy, \\"Report of Board of Inspection of Navy Yard, Philadelphia, March 25‚Äì28, 1918\\"; File 1979-10 (HQMC: April 19, 1913). The Marines found the training more demanding than any they had encountered before. Marines in the past were restricted only to sea duty; the advanced base concept opened new revolutionary methods never thought of before in United States naval history. Working by day and studying by night, the regiment's officers trained their men to assemble and aim a melange of 3-inch and naval guns, army field artillery, land mines, searchlights, and automatic weapons.Wise, Frederic M., A Marine Tells It to You, (New York City, NY: J. H. Sears, 1929); pg. 119. By March 1910, Assistant Secretary of the Navy Beekman Winthrop, acting for the Secretary, sent the order to the Commandant. The school assembled a handful of officers and men to begin the formal study of advanced base defenses.William Biddle, Commandant of the Marine Corps, to George von Lengerke Meyer, Secretary of the Navy, \\"General Correspondence, 1913‚Äì1938\\"; RG 127 The next summer, the school was moved to the Philadelphia Navy Yard in order to work more closely with the actual equipment that was to be used by the Advanced Base Force. However, training had little continuity, mostly due to various expeditionary duties that took place in the Caribbean. \\"You will prepare for the care and custody of advanced base materiel and take necessary steps to instruct the officers and men under your command in the use of this materiel.\\" ‚Äî Assistant Sec. of the Navy Beekman Winthrop to Commandant William Biddle, March 1910. Fleet exercises The Advanced Base Force Brigade, commanded by Colonel George Barnett, landed on Culebra Island off Puerto Rico on 3 January 1914, with the landing forces of the Atlantic Fleet, and spent a week preparing coastal defenses for their upcoming \\"first\\" advanced base exercise.Charles G. Long, CO 1st Regiment to George Barnett, CO 1st Adv Base Force Brigade, \\"Report on Maneuvers and Operations of First Advanced Base Brigade\\"; 30 January 1914, 'File 1975-80 (HQMC: General Correspondence, 1911-1938). The Culebra exercises became the first of many fleet landing exercises to come over the years, consisting of the occupation and defense of the island by the advanced base force brigade. The brigade emplaced batteries of field guns on each side of the entrance to Culebra's harbor and laid controlled mines offshore; the aggressor forces were simulated by a detached Marine battalion landing force with the Atlantic Fleet. The signal company, in addition to laying mines, provided communications (telegraph and telephone) for the brigade, established radio stations, and operated day and night visual stations. The engineers assisted the fixed gun companies in the preparation of gun emplacements, built docks, and established machine gun positions on certain parts of the harbor shore line. The first artillery battery emplaced guns in permanent positions, holding its field pieces in reserve. However, they found many discrepancies during the off- loading of equipment; mainly the landing craft, both experimental lighters and ships' boats, were almost to the point of being unsuitable. Once ashore, they discovered shortages of engineering tools and transportation, even with the use of the portable Decauville track system. Nonetheless, the Marines moved into position, manning the guns, their infantry entrenched. A counterattack force hidden in the hills as the \\"attacking\\" force conducted simulated raids by cruisers and large beach landing teams.John A. Lejeune, CO 2nd Regiment to George Barnett, CO 1st Adv Base Force Brigade, \\"Report on Maneuvers and Operations of First Advanced Base Brigade\\"; 30 January 1914, File 1975-80; RG 127 (HQMC: General Correspondence, 1911-1938). The chief umpire, then-Captain William S. Sims, and the Navy observers (mostly from the Naval War College) offered recommendations to the Marine artillery crews in different naval gunfire techniques. They thought that the Marines shouldn't engage the \\"enemy\\" warships in an artillery duel, risking exposure; they agreed instead that high-angle artillery and flat-trajectory naval gunfire would make the fixed defenses the absolute choice in engagements. CAPT Sims concluded that the Marines, making up the \\"mock\\" landing force of 1,200 sailors and Marines, could not breach the island's defenses.William S. Sims, report to the Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet; January 21, 1914, Lejeune Papers. However, amidst the smoke and the barrage of blanks, and an array of searchlights scanning the beaches, the Advanced Base Force successfully defended Culebra. The Navy umpires officially agreed that the Marine Corps had finally refined the advanced base concepts and were able to organize the operational units required by the General Board's war plans.John A. Lejeune, report to the Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet, \\"Report on Maneuvers and Operations of First Advanced Base Brigade\\"; 3 March 1914, GB File 432.

It has bright green leaves and unusually coloured green, gold and blackish inflorescences. Taxonomy It was described by Robert Brown in 1811 after he collected the type specimen near Cape Townsend in Queensland in August 1802. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin venustus \\"charming, lovely or graceful\\". Description Grevillea venusta is a spreading shrub which may reach 5 m (15 ft) high and wide. The branchlets are brownish and hairy, and the bright green leaves are up to 19 cm (7.5 in) long. They may be simple and 1‚Äì2 cm wide, or forked into two or more lobes. Flowering occurs from autumn to spring, the unusually coloured cylindrical inflorescences are 5‚Äì9 cm (2-3.5 in) high and terminal (appearing at the end of branchlets). Each blooms is made up of 12-20 individual flowers, which are green at the base, with gold and then purple-black styles covered with short white hairs. The seedpods which follow are greenish and measure 1.6-1.9 x 0.8 cm. Distribution and habitat It is restricted to Central Queensland in the vicinity of Byfield National Park and Shoalwater Bay, and is classified as vulnerable by the Australian government. It grows on sandy soils on ridges and in dry eucalypt forests. Cultivation This has been cultivated since the early 1970s and is suitable for use in small gardens, where it grows readily in a sunny position with good drainage. It is frost hardy and tolerates humidity. It is a parent of two commonly seen cultivars, Grevillea 'Orange Marmalade', after being bred with Grevillea glossadenia, and of Grevillea 'Firesprite', after being bred with Grevillea longistyla.

Anatomically, the rump corresponds to the sacrum. The tailhead or dock is the beginning of the tail, where the tail joins the rump. It is known also as the base or root of the tail, and corresponds to the human sacrococcygeal symphysis. In some mammals the tail may be said to consist of the tailbone (meaning the bony column, muscles, and skin) and the skirt (meaning the long hairs growing from the tailbone). In birds, similarly, the tail consists of tailbone and tailfan (tail fan). Anatomy of the horse, rear view Some animals are subjected to docking, the amputation of the tailbone at or near the dock. These include dogs, cats, sheep, pigs, and horses. Humans have a remnant tail, the coccyx, and the human equivalent of docking is coccygectomy. Usage Usage varies from animal to animal.

Horses Parts of the horse Quarter marks in checkerboard pattern on a horse's croup In horse anatomy, the croup refers specifically to the topline of the horse's hindquarters and surrounding musculature, beginning at the hip, extending proximate to the sacral vertebrae and stopping at the dock of the tail (where the coccygeal vertebrae begin). Below the croup is the thigh or haunch. Behind the thigh is the buttock. On horses appearing in parades and other public ceremonies, the croup may be decorated with a pattern in the horse's hair, formed by applying hair gel or spray, then brushing patches of hair in opposite directions. \\"Long\\" dock (i.e., skirt not covering the entire tail) of a Przewalski horse Applied to horses, the term \\"dock\\" has two additional uses.

The Reptile Database. www.reptile-database.org. Common Names of Australian Reptiles is a species of venomous snake in the family Elapidae. The species is endemic to Australia, where it is found from New South Wales to South Queensland. Elapidae Snake Tracks Species List While closely related to Australian sea snakes, P. dwyeri is a terrestrial reptile. Elapid Land Snakes (Family Elapidae, Subfamily Elapinae): South-east Queensland Etymology The specific name, dwyeri, is in honor of Australian herpetologist John Dwyer.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Suta dwyeri, p. 79). Taxonomy There has been a great amount of instability of the nomenclature of many Australian snake taxa, particularly concerning the generic classification of the smaller Elapidae, some of which have been placed in several different genera in the span of just a few decades. The good, the bad and the ugly: Australian snake taxonomists and a history of the taxonomy of Australia‚Äôs venomous snakes Accordingly, Dwyer's snake, which was originally named Denisonia dwyeri by Worrell in 1956, has been variously called Unechis dwyeri by Cogger in 1983, Suta dwyeri by Valentic in 1998, Suta spectabilis dwyeri by Cogger in 2000, and Parasuta dwyeri by Greer in 2006. Description Adult S. dwyeri males average 31 cm (12 inches) in length from the tip of the snout to the uro-genital vent. Females are slightly smaller at around 29 cm (11 inches) in snout-to-vent length (SVL). Size and Breeding Information for Australian Snakes S. dwyeri has a cylindrical brown body with a slender to medium build. The head is short and somewhat widened so as to be distinct from the neck. The tail is short as well, and the dorsal scales are smooth. The eye is medium-sized, with a vertically elliptical pupil. Clinical Toxinology Resources Reproduction Breeders of exotic reptiles advise letting pairs of S. dwyeri mate when they reach a length of about for males and for females. This species is viviparous rather than egg laying and successfully births about three offspring per brood. Newborn S. dwyeri young are about long. Defense mechanisms Like other snakes in the family Elapidae, S. dwyeri is venomous and has hollow fangs fixed at the front of the upper jaw. These fangs are connected via ducts to venom glands near the eyes. Like the majority of Australian elapids, Dwyer's snake is inoffensive and mostly harmless. Herpetologists at the Queensland Museum describe Dwyer's snake as \\"weakly venomous\\", and do not include it among their list of eight snake species in the Brisbane area considered capable of inflicting potentially fatal bites. A 25-year-old man in Western Sydney mildly describes a snakebite from this species by saying that he was: > ... bitten on the finger by a Suta dwyeri once. The bite did not hurt at > all. But little did I know he had left his fang in my finger. A couple of > days later it got a tiny bit infected and hurt for a couple of days ... > nothing major though. Aussie Pythons & Snakes (aussiepythons.com) When threatened P. dwyeri prefers to coil into a tight ball as a defense mechanism for protection from larger predators. This enables the snake to protect its head and more vulnerable areas of its body. Behaviour and habitat S. dwyeri is a secretive, nocturnal snake that seeks shelter under rocks, debris, and ground litter, and may make its home in burrows made and abandoned by other creatures. Open woodland, grassland, and rocky areas are its preferred natural habitats. Diet S. dwyeri feeds mainly on small lizards such as geckos and skinks.

Several associates who fought alongside Armitage and other politicians (including Ted Shackley)Mann, James 2004. Rise of the Vulcans Viking Press , page 42 have since claimed that Armitage was associated with the CIA's clandestine Phoenix Program. Armitage has denied a role in Phoenix and has stated that at most, CIA officers would occasionally ask him for intelligence reports.James Mann, 2004. Rise of the Vulcans Viking Press ; p. 43 In 1973, Armitage left active duty and joined the Defense Attach√© Office, Saigon. Immediately prior to the fall of Saigon, he organized and led the removal of South Vietnamese naval assets and personnel from the country and out of the hands of the approaching North Vietnamese. Armitage told South Vietnamese naval officers to take their ships to a designated place in the ocean where they would be rescued by U.S. forces and their ships destroyed. When Armitage arrived at the designated location he found 30 South Vietnamese Navy ships and dozens of fishing boats and cargo ships with as many as 30,000 Vietnamese refugees.Mann, James 2004. Rise of the Vulcans Viking Press . p. 52. With transportation options limited for removing the floating city, Armitage, aboard the destroyer escort USS Kirk, personally decided to lead the flotilla of ships over 1000 miles to shelter in Subic Bay, Philippines. This went against the wishes of both the Philippine and American governments. Nevertheless, Armitage personally arranged for food and water to be delivered by the U.S. Defense Department before negotiating with both governments for permission to dock in Subic Bay. Armitage is the recipient of several military decorations, including a Bronze Star with Combat V, Navy Commendation Medal with Combat V and Navy Achievement Medal with Combat V. Public service career Armitage served as an aide to Republican Senator Bob Dole. During the Reagan administration, he served from 1981 to 1983 as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Security Affairs for East Asia and the Pacific and became Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs on June 9, 1983, serving in that position for the next eight and a half years. Armitage was nominated by President George H. W. Bush in April 1989 to serve as Secretary of the Army under Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, but the nomination with withdrawn the following month at the request of Armitage's request, who cited a desire to spent more time with large family. During the Persian Gulf War, Bush appointed Armitage as a special emissary to King Hussein of Jordan. From March 1992 to May 1993, Armitage was posted to Europe to lead U.S. foreign aid efforts to the newly independent post-Soviet states, and held the personal rank of ambassador. After leaving the government, Armitage joined the private sector as director of US data aggregation firm ChoicePoint. Christic Institute and Khun Sa allegations In 1986, Armitage was named in an affidavit filed in a civil lawsuit by the Christic Institute as part of a conspiracy responsible for the La Penca bombing, and a number of other covert operations. The affidavit, by Christic's lead attorney Daniel Sheehan, alleged that Armitage was involved with heroin smuggling from southeast Asia to fund covert activities in South America. He and Ted Shackley were reported to be directly responsible for the Iran Contra Scandal. Similar charges were made in a 1987 letter from the Burmese warlord Khun Sa to the U.S. Justice Department. The letter, which was transmitted by James \\"Bo\\" Gritz, accused Armitage of organizing heroin smuggling from the Golden Triangle in the 1960s and 70s. Upon returning to the United States with this information, a key witness was held by the CIA in Oklahoma for a period of time.House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs, Hearings of July 30 and July 15, 1987 Armitage rebutted the charges from Sheehan and Khun Sa, observing that at dates he was said to be in Thailand, he was living in Washington D.C., working as an assistant to Senator Robert Dole. In 1988, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida dismissed the Christic suit, after finding it to be frivolous and ordered the Institute to pay $955,000 in attorneys fees and $79,500 in court costs. The ruling was subsequently upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and the Supreme Court of the United States. Bush administration Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage and NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson meet in 2002 In 1998, Armitage signed a letter to President Bill Clinton urging Clinton to target the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime from power in Iraq. It stated that Saddam's massive violations of the cease-fire that had ended the First Gulf War has caused erosion of the Gulf War Coalition's containment policy. It also raised the possibility that Iraq, emboldened by Western inaction, might re-develop weapons of mass destruction. During the 2000 Presidential election campaign, he served as a foreign policy advisor to George W. Bush as part of a group led by Condoleezza Rice that called itself The Vulcans.Richard N. Haass, War of Necessity, War of Choice Simon & Schuster, New York, 2009, p. 170 The United States Senate confirmed him as Deputy Secretary of State on March 23, 2001; he was sworn in three days later. A close associate of Secretary of State Colin Powell, Armitage was regarded, along with Powell, as a moderate within the presidential administration of George W. Bush. According to President Musharraf of Pakistan, shortly after 9/11, Armitage presented him with demands for assistance in the campaign against Al-Qaeda and the Taliban which were non- negotiable. Should Pakistan accept, it would be considered a United States ally. Should it decline, Pakistan would be considered an enemy. According to Musharraf, Armitage further averred that, should Pakistan decline, the United States would bomb it \\"back to the Stone Age\\". Armitage denies having used those words. Armitage tendered his resignation on November 16, 2004 to accompany Powell, who announced his resignation as Secretary of State the day before. He left the post on February 22, 2005, when Robert Zoellick succeeded to the office. Role in Plame affair \\"The Plame Affair\\" is a name assigned by the press to a journalistic and governmental uproar over the outing of Valerie Plame as a covert intelligence operative during the administration of President George W. Bush in 2003. An American syndicated columnist, Robert Novak, had learned of her employment by the CIA from Armitage, who was then working for the State Department, and Novak had publicly identified her as the source of a recommendation given to the President in the course of her duties. Plame had to resign from the CIA because her identity was no longer secret. A criminal investigation into the revelation produced no charges against Armitage but several charges against Scooter Libby, an assistant to Vice President Dick Cheney, for lying to the investigators about the matter. Libby was convicted but his jail sentence was ultimately commuted by Bush, and he was subsequently pardoned by President Donald Trump on April 13, 2018. Armitage with President George W. Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell, August 6, 2003 Armitage's defense that he had inadvertently made an off-hand remark during a probing interview with Novak, coupled with his candor and cooperation, was accepted, although the decision not to prosecute was not made until 2006. Meanwhile, the long and slow investigation played out in the press as a scandal, \\"the Plame Affair\\" or \\"Plamegate\\". On November 15, 2005, journalist Bob Woodward of The Washington Post revealed in an article that \\"a government official with no axe to grind\\" leaked to him the identity of outed CIA officer Valerie Plame in mid-June 2003. According to an April 2006 Vanity Fair article (published March 14, 2006), former Washington Post executive editor Ben Bradlee said in an interview \\"that Armitage is the likely source is a fair assumption\\", though Bradlee later told the Post that he \\"[did] not recall making that precise statement\\" in the interview. The following year, on March 2, 2006, bloggers discovered that \\"Richard Armitage\\" fit the spacing on a redacted court document, suggesting he was a source for the Plame leak. In August 2006, the Associated Press published a story that revealed Armitage met with Bob Woodward in mid-June 2003. The information came from official State Department calendars provided to the Associated Press under the Freedom of Information Act. Robert Novak, in an August 27, 2006 appearance on Meet the Press, stated that although he still would not release the name of his source, he felt it was long overdue that the source reveal himself. He had reason to think that the source might do that. Armitage had reportedly been a cooperative and key witness in the investigation. According to The Washington Note, Armitage had testified before the grand jury three times. Press reports continued to mount and pressure to build. On August 29, 2006, Neil A. Lewis of The New York Times reported that Armitage was the \\"initial and primary source\\" for columnist Robert Novak's July 14, 2003 article, which named Plame as a CIA \\"operative\\" and which triggered the CIA leak investigation. On August 30, 2006, CNN reported that Armitage had been confirmed \\"by sources\\" as leaking Wilson's CIA role in a \\"casual conversation\\" with Robert Novak. The New York Times, quoting \\"people familiar with his actions\\", reported that Armitage was unaware of Wilson's undercover status when he spoke to Novak. In the September 4, 2006 issue of Newsweek magazine, in an article titled \\"The Man Who Said Too Much\\", journalist Michael Isikoff, quoting a source \\"directly familiar with the conversation who asked not to be identified because of legal sensitivities\\", reported that Armitage was the \\"primary\\" source for Novak's piece outing Plame. Armitage allegedly mentioned Wilson's CIA role to Novak in a July 8, 2003 interview after learning about her status from a State Department memo which made no reference to her undercover status. Isikoff also reported that Armitage had also told Bob Woodward of Plame's identity in June 2003, and that special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald investigated Armitage's role \\"aggressively\\", but did not charge Armitage with a crime because he \\"found no evidence that Armitage knew of Plame's covert CIA status when he talked to Novak and Woodward\\". On September 7, 2006, Armitage admitted to being the source in the CIA leak. Armitage claims that Fitzgerald had originally asked him not to discuss publicly his role in the matter, but that on September 5 Armitage asked Fitzgerald if he could reveal his role to the public, and Fitzgerald consented. The Times claims that White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales was informed that Armitage was involved on October 2, 2003, but asked not to be told details. Fitzgerald began his grand jury investigation three months later knowing Armitage was a leaker (as did Attorney General John Ashcroft before turning over the investigation). On March 6, 2007, a jury convicted Lewis \\"Scooter\\" Libby, Chief of Staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, of \\"obstruction of justice, giving false statements to the FBI and perjuring himself, charges embodied in four of the five counts of the indictment\\". On July 2, 2007, President Bush issued a grant of executive clemency that commuted the prison term imposed on Lewis Libby. In a review of Hubris: The Inside Story of Spin, Scandal, and the Selling of the Iraq War, by Michael Isikoff and David Corn, which hit bookstores in early September 2006, Novak wrote: \\"I don't know precisely how Isikoff flushed out Armitage [as Novak's original source], but Hubris clearly points to two sources: Washington lobbyist Kenneth Duberstein, Armitage's political adviser, and William Taft IV, who was the State Department legal adviser when Armitage was deputy secretary\\". Pakistan and the fight against terrorism Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, in an interview with CBS News 60 Minutes on September 21, 2006, alleged that Armitage called an Inter-Services Intelligence general immediately after the September 11, 2001 attacks and threatened to \\"bomb the country [Pakistan] back to the stone age\\" unless they supported the U.S.-led fight against Islamic terrorism. Presently, Musharraf has refused to provide details, commenting that he is unable to provide details due to restrictions by the publisher (Simon & Schuster) of his book In the Line of Fire: A Memoir. President Bush, on the other hand, has mentioned that he only became aware of these comments as late as September 2006, when he read them in the newspapers. Armitage confirmed he had held a conversation with the Pakistani general to whom Musharraf had sourced the comments, but stated he had not used a threat of military action couched in such terms, as he was not authorized to do so. Life after public service There was some media speculation that President Bush would appoint him to a key security position such as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Director of National Intelligence or Defense Secretary. Notwithstanding this, Armitage has not re-entered public service. In October 2006, Armitage lobbied‚Äîon behalf of the L-3 Communications Corporation, a company providing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance products‚Äîsome key people in Taiwanese political circles regarding the possible sale of P-3C marine patrol aircraft to the ROC military. Those who received his personal letter included Premier Su Tseng- chang, President of the Legislative Yuan Wang Jin-pyng, and opposition People First Party leader James Soong. Armitage stated in the letter that he wished the Taiwan government would reconsider the purchase from Lockheed Martin, the dealer the United States government had designated. Instead, he hoped that the right to negotiate the purchase should be made through an open and fair bidding process. The letter was made public by PFP Legislators on October 24, 2006, in a Legislative Yuan session discussing the military purchases. In a 2009 interview, Armitage said that waterboarding, a tactic used by the CIA during the George W. Bush administration on suspected terrorists in 2002 and 2003, was torture, but that he did not believe CIA officials should be prosecuted for ordering its use. Armitage said that he did not know about the CIA torture program while he was Deputy Secretary of State, and that \\"I hope, had I known about it at the time I was serving, I would've had the courage to resign.\\"Pamela Hess, Ex-Bush official says waterboarding is torture, Associated Press (April 15, 2009).Armitage denounces harsh tactics, Associated Press (April 16, 2009). Armitage has served on a number of boards for corporations and nonprofits.

It was launched in Columbus, Ohio, on December 1, 1977. Highly publicized as a revolutionary advancement,Alford, Bernard. \\"Columbus Goes Bananaz: The QUBE Experiment in Ohio,\\" The Great Lakes Review, vol. 5, no. 1, 1978, pp. 19‚Äì27. the QUBE experiment introduced viewers to several concepts that became central to the future development of TV technology: pay-per-view programs, special-interest cable television networks, and interactive services.Interactive Television, Museum of Broadcast Communications History A closed-circuit television system at the Otani Hotel in Tokyo, Japan inspired Steve Ross, Chairman of Warner Communications, to wonder what could be done to improve the performance of Warner's tiny cable television division. Ross was intrigued by the potential of delivering Warner Bros. movies directly to home subscribers.\\"When Cable Went Qubist,\\" by Ken Freed. At the time, Warner Cable was a small division of Warner Communications, run by a former Western Union telecommunications executive and attorney, Gus Hauser. Ross surrounded Hauser with entertainment industry executives, including Jac Holzman, who had sold his Elektra Records to Ross in 1967; Mike Dann, the CBS programming wizard responsible for The Beverly Hillbillies and Green Acres; former CBS general counsel Spencer Harrison, an executive involved in the launch of My Fair Lady on Broadway; and super-agent Ted Ashley, whose talent agency was Ross's first show-biz acquisition. Ross created Dimension Pictures, a second Warner Communications film studio that was founded in 1970 and closed in 1981. Pioneer Electronics was hired to \\"build the box\\" that would transform the cable TV service in a few hundred thousand households into a device that was intended to change the entire entertainment landscape. The service was first launched in Columbus, Ohio, amidst considerable national and international press coverage.Talking Back to Television, The Washington Post, September 3, 1978. Hauser dispatched young New York City executive Nyhl Henson to oversee and direct the Columbus interactive channel plan. The initial QUBE service debuted with 30 channels (a large number of cable channels at the time), including 10 pay-per-view movie channels (a then-new feature for cable TV); 10 broadcast channels (from Columbus, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Canton, Akron, and Cleveland); and 10 community channels.Mrozinski, R. V. Home/Urban Communications‚ÄîInformation Systems. Published in: Manassah, J. T. Innovations in Telecommunications, Part B. New York: Academic Press, 1982, p. 1051-1052. These community channels included one dedicated to a single show: Pinwheel, which would go on to air on Nickelodeon from the latter's launch in 1979; Sight on Sound, a predecessor to MTV; a weather channel; a learning channel; and a channel filled with locally produced programs that showed off QUBE's interactivity. The first QUBE box was issued as a test for 4 months to the family of Mr. and Mrs. Walter B. Kesler, in Hilliard, Ohio. The Kesler family watched the broadcasts that were intended for a larger audience, and caused the eventual push in programming that would affect how cable formatted shows would be put together based on their viewing habits. The Keslers' children, Lori A. and Kurt W., are regarded to be the first product of the \\"cable generation.\\" The successes of QUBE To 30,000 homes scattered around the city and its suburbs, the goal of QUBE was rather simple: \\"To create a faster method for groups to communicate and interact, across distance.\\" Warner used the QUBE system to acquire valuable cable franchises, with which it would build and create cable monopolies in several large markets throughout the country. Warner QUBE was \\"awarded\\" cable franchises in cities such as Houston, Milwaukee, Dallas, Cincinnati, St. Louis and Pittsburgh. Many of the fundamental aspects of QUBE became important parts of television: Pay-Per-View and TV On Demand, MTV and Nickelodeon. QUBE itself was successfully installed and used in half the homes in Columbus, and the interactive results showed a high volume of participation from viewers who had the QUBE box and remote. The later remotes added five additional buttons for a total of ten options, and became wireless. After launching a few other systems beyond Columbus, QUBE created an interactive network in Columbus, which sent live, interactive programming to each of the QUBE systems for two hours per night during weeknights. One of the most popular programs on QUBE, Soap Scoop, wrapped up the daily events on each of the national soap operas. Guests on the show included producers and actors from the various programs; the show frequently polled viewers on their opinions regarding characters and plots. The failures of QUBE By 1982, Warner Cable was running at a $99 million loss, and by 1983, their total debt was $875 million. Warner Cable brought in American Express as an investor, and the two companies formed Warner-Amex Cable Communications with a widely-recognized board of directors, including American Express chairman Jim Robinson and President Lou Gerstner, and the former head of Shearson/American Express, Sanford Weill. Warner bought out American Express after the latter made an offer to buy Warner's position, leading to conflicts between the two companies. By this time, MTV and Nickelodeon became meaningful endeavors in their own right under the leadership of Bob Pittman and Geraldine Laybourne respectively. Through the early 1980s, QUBE was either up and running or already built in Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Dallas, Houston, and St. Louis. Warner Cable now had 200,000 subscribers instead of 2; the new figure accounted for roughly 1 in 10 U.S. cable television subscribers. Pittman led an unsuccessful effort to buy MTV; there was also an unsuccessful attempt at a public offering. Gus Hauser was gone; taking his place would be President Reagan's Transportation Secretary, Drew Lewis. Lewis renegotiated with municipalities to ease the burden to Warner of some of the cable franchise deals. However, in order to keep the cable operation going, Warner Cable went out to sell MTV and Nickelodeon to Viacom, and the QUBE systems were gradually phased out. The last QUBE boxes were phased out in 1984. In addition to financial issues,John Carey. Interactive Television Trials and Marketplace Experiences. In: Zhang, Shifu, Dimitris Anastassiou, Alexandros Eleftheriadis, and John V. Pavlik (eds.). Video on Demand Systems: Technology, Interoperability and Trials. Boston: Springer, 1997, pp. 93-102. privacy concerns increased among subscribers to QUBE. Personal information about a family's specific interests, political views and other personal information could be stored in a database after it was processed during an interactive QUBE session. For example, a program could ask viewers to identify their favorite political candidates as part of a national survey, but this information could potentially be traced directly back to the respondents. Although Warner-Amex assured subscribers that their personal information would be kept private, such data was valuable to merchandisers, political groups and other organizations. Even if subscribers trusted Warner-Amex's commitment to privacy, there were still concerns regarding the ability for computer hackers to potentially steal information collected via QUBE. Consequently, non-renewals became more numerous, ultimately contributing to the demise of the QUBE experiment.Barnouw, E. Tube of Plenty: The Evolution of American Television. New York: Oxford University Press, 1990. QUBE channels Initially, there were thirty analog video channels that were arranged in three clusters: ten broadcast TV channels, ten pay-per-view channels (billed monthly), and ten channels that included interactive services:Jens J.

It aired on Nickelodeon when it launched in April 1979 and continued until 1984, with reruns airing until 1990. *Flippo's Magic Circus was a children's series, hosted by the locally- known Flippo the Clown, that featured in-studio and play-at-home interactive games. *How Do You Like Your Eggs?, a four-episode game show hosted by Bill Cullen, involved two couples predicting how the home audience responded to questions. *QUBE promised an interactive gaming channel, a forefront to video games, that was supposed to award prizes, such as free service credits. This never materialized. *Columbus Goes Bananaz was a show aimed at teens, hosted by Michael Young and later Randy Hamilton. It later moved to Nickelodeon with new episodes as America Goes Bananaz, airing from 1979 to 1980. QUBE remote from 1980 (updated for 60-channel service) QUBE remote The QUBE remote was a book-size box with 18 buttons on it that sent signals across a long tether cable to a box with no display, but otherwise similar in size and function to modern cable set-top boxes. The remote had feet for tabletop use, but could be hand-held (probably two hands) and passed around the room, which was significant since many TVs at the time had no remotes for changing channels. The buttons were split up on the remote, with ten buttons numbered 1 - 10 down the left-hand side, five larger buttons down the right hand side, each with a corresponding red LED indicator, and three buttons across the bottom of the remote. The three big buttons across the bottom chose which category of channel the viewer would watch: pay-per-view, broadcast, or community broadcasting. The ten buttons down the left accessed each of the ten channels in that category. The 5 buttons down the right-hand side corresponded with the interactive aspect of the QUBE. They allowed a television program to ask viewers a question with five possible answers. Answers to polls taken via the QUBE box could be collected from the set-top boxes in six seconds. A computer would record the information and then display the results on the television screen for everyone to see. In the middle of these three rows of buttons was a clear plastic window that held a channel card with station names and logos arranged in a grid corresponding to the ten \\"row\\" buttons on the left and the three \\"column\\" buttons along the bottom. Channel cards were mailed to customers with each change in the channel line-up. Customers would remove the old guides and slide in the new ones. On the top of the remote was a hole in which a \\"key\\" (really just a magnet in a proprietary plastic holder) was inserted to unlock viewing of pay-per-view programming, which could be billed in much the same way as modern cable pay-per-view programs are. Without the key inserted, restricted channels displayed a default access denial screen. Though the service launched with thirty channels, the remote actually supported up to sixty (twenty in each category) and this capability was eventually used in some markets. Pressing one of the 1-10 buttons would select the first channel in that slot; pressing the same button again would toggle to the second channel. Stickers were provided to customers to update their remote, and new channel cards listed two channels per slot.Special report: Warner Cable's QUBE, The Videocassette and CAT&V; Newsletter, May 1978. Archived Post-QUBE Although QUBE had a short lifespan of seven years and multiple shortcomings, it occupies a unique place in media history since it was a venture that led to other innovations in television industry. Among others, it triggered the birth of several innovative cable television networks, such as MTV and Nickelodeon, contributed to the growth of infomercials, and introduced instant television ratings. According to Everett Rogers, it also became the first media enterprise that raised serious concerns about large-scale user privacy issues.Rogers, Everett M. Communication Technology: The New Media in Society. New York: Free Press, 1986, p. 63. QUBE served as an incubator for a large number of media innovators. Some examples of people who worked on QUBE, moving on to other technological and media innovations, are: * Scott Kurnit founded About.com, after a senior role at the pioneering online service, Prodigy. * Ron Castell became a senior executive at Blockbuster. * Howard Blumenthal, creator-producer of How Do You Like Your Eggs?, later developed MTV's Remote Control and PBS' Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?, then shifted to executive roles. * Steve Bornstein, producer for Ohio State Buckeyes football programming on QUBE, became an executive with ESPN and the president of NFL Network. * Burt Dubrow, whose career in talk shows brought about the success of Jerry Springer and Sally Jessy Raphael * Ken Papagan, who continued his innovative work in interactive media as an executive with design and consulting firm iXL and as President of Rentrak. * Robert Morton, whose executive producer credits include Late Night with David Letterman, Mind of Mencia, and Lopez Tonight. * Jim Jinkins, who played Minus on Pinwheel, created and produced the Nickelodeon (and later Disney) series, Doug, and other animated series * Dick Liberatore hosted a game show pilot titled Pass or Play, which was directed by Robert Morton. Shortly after taping, \\"Dick\\" moved to San Diego and changed his name to Mark Richards. In 1982, Mark was chosen by Ted Turner to host Starcade, cable television's very first original game show, which aired on superstation WTBS. * Ron Giles, co- host and producer of Columbus Alive, who developed the QVC television operation, first in the U.S., then internationally * Nancy Gould Chuda became producer of ABC's annual An Evening With Friends for the Environment celebrity special.Kent Gibbons.

It is the main company of the Laurent-Perrier Group, whose other flagship brands include the houses of Salon, De Castellane and Delamotte. Laurent-Perrier Group also acquired Chateau Malakoff as of 2004. With over 1,200 grape growers with supply contracts, Laurent-Perrier exports to more than 120 countries. Laurent- Perrier rose to become the world's third best selling champagne brand as of 2005, behind Mo√´t et Chandon and Veuve Clicquot. History Ros√© Champagne from Laurent Perrier In 1812 a former cooper and bottler, Alphonse Pierlot, purchased two parcels of land named \\"Plaisances\\" and \\"La Tour Glorieux\\" in Tours-sur-Marne. Pierlot willed his company to his cellar master, Eugene Laurent, who ran it with his wife, Mathilde Emilie Perrier. After Eugene Laurent died in 1887 his widow, Mathilde, took control and attached her name to the company, changing it to Veuve Laurent-Perrier (veuve means \\"widow\\"). Veuve Mathilde led the company to great success, producing 50,000 cases of Champagne. This success was short-lived, due to the outbreak of World War I. Following the War, Veuve Mathilde hired Alexander Fletcher Keith Mackenzie to introduce and market Laurent-Perrier in the United Kingdom. In 1925 Veuve Mathilde died, leaving the company to Eugenie Hortense Laurent. Due to the setbacks from World War I and the imminent outbreak of World War II, Eugenie sold the company to Mary-Louise Lanson de Nonancourt in 1939. Marie-Louise invested all she could in the company, keeping it afloat through the turmoils of war, at one point mortgaging 1,000 cases of Champagne she had hidden in a wall. Her eldest son, Maurice, died during the war in the concentration camp at Oranienburg, leaving his younger brother, Bernard de Nonancourt, as the heir apparent. Upon Bernard's return from war, his mother began set about educating him on every aspect of Champagne making at the Houses of Lanson and Delamotte. In 1949 Bernard de Nonancourt became the owner of the company and saw it become one of the largest family-owned Champagne houses. The de Nonancourt family still retains majority ownership of the company to this day. Subsidiaries and partnerships Beginning in the late 1970s, Laurent-Perrier established a series of wholly owned subsidiaries, starting in U.K. in 1978, and followed by Switzerland (1992), U.S. (1998), and Belgium (1999). Relais et Chateau is an international organization which promotes particularly unique hotel and restaurant establishments of which Laurent-Perrier became an official Champagne partner in 2001. In 2003 JEROBOAM Co., Ltd was created after Laurent-Perrier, Hugel and Perrin banded together with several other private French and Japanese partners.

He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2011 in the Natural Sciences category. Research ;Brain complexity One of the core areas of research being conducted by Dr. Sporns is in the area of complexity of the brain. One aspect in particular is how small-world network effects are seen in the neural connections which are decentralized in the brain. Research in collaboration with scientists across the world has revealed that there are pathways in the brain that are very well connected. This is insightful for understanding how the architecture of the brain may relate to schizophrenia, autism, and Alzheimer's disease. Dr. Sporns is also interested in understanding the relationship between statistical properties of neuronal populations and perceptual data. How does an organism use and structure its environment in such a way as to achieve (statistically) complex input? To this end, he has run statistical analysis on movement patterns and input within simulations, videos, and robotic devices. ;Reward systems Dr. Sporns also has a research interest in reward models of the brain utilizing robots.

It has an average population of almost 10,000 students from Junior and Senior High School and 250 teachers. MHPNHS is one of the oldest secondary schools in the Philippines established in 1905. It offers the five curricula endorsed by the Department of Education: the Engineering and Science Education Program, the Basic Education Curriculum, the Special Program for Sports, the Special Program for Journalism and the Special Program for Foreign Language. The academic year 2010‚Äì2011 pioneers the revised curriculum of the Basic Education Curriculum and changed to Secondary Education Curriculum for freshman students. Bulacan High School Bulacan High School had its beginning in the progressive town of Baliuag, where it was temporarily located early in 1902. Here a number of students, mostly boys, representing but a few towns of the province, together with a class of twenty who had made some progress in Spanish schools, were placed in a room of a private dwelling under the charge of two American teachers. It was called High School in order to induce the attendance of those pupils who had made some instruction in the instruction in Spanish \\"Colegios\\" and were unwilling to attend an elementary school under its true name. These young men being only eighty-seven members. During its short period of existence, it had accomplished much, for it had sent forth many young teachers to the province. In 1903, there were two hundred fifty pupils, and the number of teachers was increased to seven. Among the activities of the school was the organization of a literary society. In 1904, there were two hundred twenty-seven pupils, and six teachers. Two literary societies were organized and for the next three years were an important factor i building up the school and creating an interest in English. The pupils were classified as sections A, B, C, D, E, and F, and the work corresponded to our present fourth, fifth and sixth grades. This year plans and specifications for a new P32,000.00 High School at Malolos, Bulacan were completed and the money for the building was appropriated from the provincial funds. In 1905, the enrollment reached two hundred sixty-six. The school was reorganized as to give the full intermediate course and the first year of the secondary course. This marks the beginning of the High School proper. The first chorus work was done this year, and physical training and athletics were introduced in accordance with the plan of the Bureau of Education. A tennis court was made and a baseball team was organized; also the first instruction in sewing was given this year, the girls furnishing their own materials. The Engineering and Science Education Program (ESEP) *History The Engineering and Science Education Program (ESEP), formerly the Special Science Class, is a brainchild of the former Department of Education Culture and Sports Superintendent Bienvenido F. Yap. The Special Science Class formally opened in the school year 1986‚Äì1987 within three provincial high schools in Bulacan‚ÄîMarcelo H. del Pilar High School, Mariano Ponce High School and San Miguel High School. The retirement of Superintendent Bienvenido Yap also signaled the end of the implementation of the Special Science Class. Its abolition paved way for the now Engineering and Science Education Program, a new and revised science-oriented curriculum for several chosen schools. Our School became one of the 110 ESEP networks of secondary schools nationwide selected by the Science Education Institute and the Department of Science and Technology (SEI-DOST) in coordination with the Bureau of Secondary Education, Department of Education, Culture and Sports. The Engineering and Science Education Program (ESEP) is a science and mathematics-oriented curriculum devised for a special secondary education. It was created with the purpose of giving an education highly enriched in science and mathematics to exceptionally bright students. The MHPNHS-ESEP, with its competent faculty and staff, continues to produce competent professionals in the sciences, engineering, and mathematics and other fields. (from the student's handbook of the ESEP curriculum written by Dr. Ma. Victoria C. Vivo) *Mission The MHPNHS-ESEP offers an education that is humanistic in spirit, global in perspective, and patriotic in orientation. It is based on an enhanced, challenging and innovative curriculum that provides an educational plan with emphasis on math, science and technology. The MHPNHS-ESEP engenders in a student a passion for learning and shapes him to be an independent, responsible, educated and self-directed individual, working towards the realization of his dreams and so becoming a productive citizen of our country.(from the student's handbook of the ESEP curriculum written by Dr. Ma. Victoria C. Vivo) Implementing Policies and Guidelines *Admission The students shall be admitted to the program based on the following requirements: Elementary pupils who belong to the top ten (10) of the graduating class for schools with one hundred or less pupils and ten percent (10%) of the graduating class for schools with more than one hundred (100) graduating pupils. These pupils should present a certification from the Principal that they belong to this group. *Retention in the Program To remain in the program, the student should obtain a general average of 85% in Science, Mathematics and English and 83% in the rest of the subjects without grade lower than 80% in any grading period. Failure to meet the grade requirements shall be a cause of transfer to the regular class. Selection shall be done in two (2) stages to be conducted by the school as follows: Stage 1 ‚Äì Preliminary elimination by the school including the interview process. Stage 2- Written examination prepared by BSE. * Transferring in the Program Students enrolled in these schools are allowed to transfer laterally, at any curriculum year level (except in the fourth year) to another S & T Oriented (ESEP) High Schools, as long as the grade requirement is maintained.

Foundation  The word Qarauna derived from the Mongolian word Kara meaning black in Turkish. At first they were subjects of the Great Khan and served as tamnas or tamachis in Afghanistan. The Great Khan appointed their leaders from non-Chingisid generals such as Dayir and Mungudei. In 1238, they settled near India to face the military forces of the Delhi Sultanate. In the 1250s their leader was Sali Noyan who was of Tatar origin. M√∂ngke Khan ordered Sali Noyan and his tamna soldiers to join Hulegu's army in 1253. In 1260, Jochid Baval, the father of Nogai Khan, was executed on the orders of Hulegu Khan after gaining permission from Berke who was the khan of the Golden Horde. Soon after that, Kuli and Tutar, also Golden Horde princes, died under suspicious circumstances. Golden Horde soldiers who served Hulgeu feared for their lives and began to move to the Kipchak Steppes via Derbent while others moved through Syria to Egypt. Angered, Hulegu punished many soldiers of the Golden Horde for the defeat of Ain Jalut. The Mongol general Baiju was executed as well. To the east, the flight of Jochid troops into Afghanistan in significant numbers led to the creation of the Negudari (Nikudari) Mongols or Qara'unas in 1262. Berke ordered general Neguder to carry out raids in the eastern part of the Ilkhanate. Some historians refer to the Qara'unas as Neguderis. This term was derived from the name of Negudar.  Qara'unas in Mongol Empire  Although some scholars claim that the Qara'unas did not owe allegiance to any khanate in the 1290s, it is also claimed that the Qara'unas were largely brought under the Chagatai Khanate during the reign of Alghu in 1262. As a result of wars between the Mongol khanates, the Qara'unas deserted Hulegu and captured Sali bahadur. While a majority of Qara'unas were ruled by Chagatai princes, there was another group in Khorasan which formed the eastern border for Abagha Khan. He appointed former Chagatai Khan Mubarak Shah their leader. Duwa recalled his cousin Abdullah and appointed his son Qutlugh Khwaja a governor there in 1299. The descendants of Duwa ruled the Qara'unas after that. Oljeitu reasserted his ancestors' claim on Afghanistan and repelled the Qara'unas in 1314. Another Chagatai prince Yasa'ur was given lands in Afghanistan by the latter Ilkhan. Thanks to his complaisance towards both the Buyantu Ayurbawda Khan of the Yuan and the Ilkhan Oljeitu, Kebek reoccupied the territory peacefully. Esenbuqa and Tarmashirin were all military governors of the Qara'unas who later became Chagatai Khans. This military group had participated in all Mongol invasions of India after 1241.  Rise to power and decline  Serving under the Khans, they gained confidence from them. Qaraunas were the main force for the campaigns in Persia and India. Neguderis wintered around Ghazna and summered in Ghur and Garchistan. According to Marco Polo, they were mixed with Indians and Turks, because these soldiers were unable to reach Mongolia to find Mongol wives. After the death of Qazan Khan, the Chagatai Khanate split into two parts until it was temporarily reunited under Tughlugh Timur (1347‚Äì1363). Chagatai Mongol fell under the control of semi-nomadic oboghs: the Arlat in the west, the Barlas in the center, and the Jalayir in the north, and two non- tribal military groups, the Qaraunas and the Qa'uchin. While the Mongols in Moghulistan, the eastern part of the Chagatai Khanate, called their western counterparts in Transaxonia Qara'unas (blacks or mixed breed), the western Chagatayid called the Mongols of Moghulistan Jete (bandits). The western part of the khanate was under the control of Qara'unas such as amir Qazaghan and his son ‚ÄòAbdullah. But Suldus and Barlas nobles revolted against their rule in 1359. With the Mongol (Moghul) invasion in 1360, the Qarauna ascendancy failed. In 1362 Tamerlane (Temur, Timur) rejoined the Qaraunas under Qazaghan's grandson, Husayn. They freed Transaxonia from the Mongols of Moghulistan, whom they considered unruly bandits in the next year. But in 1365 the Moghuls invaded again. The Qarauna and Barlas forces were defeated. Quickly after the Khan's fail, Timur and Husayn recovered. They co-ruled Maweranhar and installed a puppet khan. Husayn decided to build himself a permanent capital and urban base on the site of Balkh in Afghanistan and Turkestan, ruined since the time of Chingis, but now to be developed as an anti Samarkand. When the ambitious Temur finally revolted in 1370 at the head of his coalition, Husayn had little support left and was easily defeated and killed. Temur fully subjugated the Qara'unas in the 1380s. During the reign of Temur (d.1405), Qara'unas formed a huge part of his army. Babur noted that they still spoke Mongolian in the late 15th century.  Modern descendants  The Nikudari are (or were; Weiers notes that his informants were not aware of this term anymore) a population group of Afghanistan of Mongolic origin. They are distinct from them in that the Hazara don‚Äôt exhibit any Mongolic linguistic peculiarities. The Nikudari, on the other hand, used to speak Moghol which is probably extinct now. Their tribal name hails from their former military leader, Negudar, who according to Morgan was a general of the Golden Horde,Morgan, David (2007 [1986]): The Mongols. Malden: Blackwell Publishing: 95 but according to the research of Weiers that Morgan fails to quote was a leader of rebels against Abaqa Khan.

Essentially, it is a self-imposed rule to limit jurisdiction in respect of actions relating to: * Title to Foreign Land * Possession to Foreign Land * Damages of Trespass to Foreign Land In Hesperides Hotels v Muftizade Lord Wilberforce referred to the ruling in Mozambique in the following terms: \\"Subject to exceptions hereafter mentioned, the court has no jurisdiction to entertain an action for (1) the determination of title to, or the right to the possession of, any immovable situate out of England (foreign land); or (2) the recovery of damages for trespass to such immovable\\".Hesperides Hotels Ltd v Muftizade [1979] 508. Although, under section 30(1) of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 \\"the jurisdiction of any court in England and Wales or Northern Ireland to entertain proceedings for trespass to, or any other tort affecting, immovable property shall extend to cases in which the property in question is situated outside that part of the United Kingdom unless the proceedings are principally concerned with a question of the title to, or the right to possession of, that property.\\" This rule was subject to much criticism and later became abolished by the above section (section 30(1) of the 1893 Act). History of the Rule The decision in British South Africa Co v Companhia de Mo√ßambique was based exclusively on the historical development of the circumstances in which, and reasons for which, a court in England would take jurisdiction to hear any matter. In the 12th and early 13th centuries, the jury in both civil and criminal matters performed a role that resembles the modern day witness rather than as judges of fact. In particular, there was a requirement that the jury had to be drawn from the particular locality (e.g. village) from which the cause of action had arisen. This was based on the assumption that people from that locality are acquainted with the facts in the case from their personal knowledge. Therefore, it was important for the parties to the action to specify the venue or place at which the event occurred so that the Sheriff can summon the jury from that place. Law of Henry I (1100‚Äì1135) for instance, declared that juries from other than the venue stated were not to be permitted in any circumstances. At the end of the 13th century or the beginning of the 14th century, due to the increasing sophistication of transactions and dispositions, this rule caused considerable inconvenience. This was especially so when the facts alleged occurred partly in one locality and partly in another. To resolve this problem, courts at that time began to differentiate between \\"local\\" and \\"transitory\\" actions. Local actions were one in which the facts relied on by the plaintiff had a necessary connection with a particular place (e.g. action for ejectment from land). Transitory actions (such as breach of contract or trespass to the person) had no such necessary connection. In the early development of the law relating to transitory actions, the rule was loosened so that the plaintiff may specify the venue in any county he/she desired. However, this led to abuses and in the 15th century, the statutes of Richard II and Henry IV reimposed strict requirements of laying the correct venue. However, the effects of these statutes was diminished by the use of a legal fiction (e.g. allegation that the \\"foreign place\\" was situated in the London parish of St. Marylebone). This legal fiction was developed as the courts realised the advantages of taking jurisdiction over mercantile matters which might have arisen outside England. This development led to a distinction between local and transitory actions. With transitory actions, venue remained only a limitation on the verbal formula by which the plaintiff might frame a cause of action. However, with local actions, the requirement of the plaintiff laying the correct venue remained. This strict distinction remained despite the fact that by the 16th century, the role of juries was changed. Juries had become triers of fact and the practice of laying sworn testimony of witnesses had become general. The juries, however, still had to be drawn from the county in which the venue was laid. If the matter had arisen outside England (i.e. a foreign locality), the legal fictions employed in transitory actions were not applicable, and so jury could be summoned to try the facts in issue. The matter could not be heard. For example, in Skinner v East India Co 6 St Tr 710, the House of Lords in 1666, held that actions relating to ships and trespass to the person could be determined in courts in England because they were transitory in nature. But actions for dispossession of house and island, was not relievable in courts of England because they are local in nature. In 1873, the Judicature Act abolished r 28 of the Rules of the Court. This meant that there was no need for a local venue to be laid. However, this change raised some issues. In particular, R H Collins argued that the legislative change might remove the disability of the English courts in relation to local actions, especially where the parties were domiciled in England. In the Court of Appeal in the Mozambique case, a majority (Fry and Lopes LJJ, Lord Esher dissenting) took a similar view of the effect of that Act. Fry LJ considered that the issue of jurisdiction in actions relating to land outside England could be resolved in two parts: Firstly, if the matter were requiring adjudication as to title, the court could not take jurisdiction, since it would have no power to ensure the execution of its order. Secondly, if the issue related to no more than trespass to foreign land, and judgment might be given by way of an award of damages against the defendant, the only bar to the exercise by the English court of jurisdiction was the technical one that the action was a local one for which a local venue was required to be laid. Therefore, Fry LJ concluded that due to the abolition of local venues by the Act, there was nothing to prevent the court from taking jurisdiction. But this argument was rejected by Lord Hershell LC in the House of Lords. Lord Hershell LC said: \\"The grounds upon which the courts have refused to exercise jurisdiction in actions of trespass to land situate abroad were substantial and not technical, and that the rules of procedure under the Judicature Acts have not conferred a jurisdiction which did not exist before\\". Even though the courts have many opportunities to overturn the rule, they have refused to do so. Vinelott J in Tyburn Productions v Conan DoyleTyburn Productions v Conan Doyle [1991] Ch 75; [1990] 185. reasoned that it was too late for the courts to overturn the distinctions between local and transitory actions because it is settled. Vinelott J also reasoned that the grounds to which the courts have hitherto refused to exercise jurisdiction in actions of trespass to land situated abroad was substantial and not technical, and that the distinction was not accordingly affected by the Judicature Acts.

There are two distinct subgenres of Japanese cyberpunk: live-action Japanese cyberpunk films, and cyberpunk manga and anime works. Japanese cyberpunk cinema refers to a genre of underground film produced in Japan starting in the 1980s. It bears some resemblance to the 'low life high-tech' cyberpunk as understood in the West, however differs in its representation of industrial and metallic imagery and an incomprehensible narrative. The origins of the genre can be traced back to the 1982 film Burst City, before the genre was primarily defined by the 1989 film Tetsuo: The Iron Man. It has roots in the Japanese punk subculture that arose from the Japanese punk music scene in the 1970s, with Sogo Ishii's punk films of the late 1970s to early 1980s introducing this subculture to Japanese cinema and paving the way for Japanese cyberpunk. Japanese cyberpunk also refers to a subgenre of manga and anime works with cyberpunk themes. This subgenre began in 1982 with the debut of Katsuhiro Otomo's manga series Akira, with its 1988 anime film adaptation (which Otomo directed) later popularizing the subgenre. Akira inspired a wave of Japanese cyberpunk works, including manga and anime series such as Ghost in the Shell, Battle Angel Alita, Cowboy Bebop, and Serial Experiments Lain. Cyberpunk anime and manga have been influential on global popular culture, inspiring numerous works in animation, comics, film, music, television and video games. Japanese cyberpunk films Style Japanese Cyberpunk generally involves the characters, especially the protagonist, going through monstrous, incomprehensible metamorphoses in an industrial setting. Many of these films have scenes that fall into the experimental film genre; they often involve purely abstract or visual sequences that may or may not relate to the characters and plot. Recurring themes include: mutation, technology, dehumanization, repression and sexual deviance. Precursors In contrast to Western cyberpunk which has roots in New Wave science fiction literature, Japanese cyberpunk has roots in underground music culture, specifically the Japanese punk subculture that arose from the Japanese punk music scene in the 1970s. The filmmaker Sogo Ishii introduced this subculture to Japanese cinema with his punk films Panic High School (1978) and Crazy Thunder Road (1980), which portrayed the rebellion and anarchy associated with punk, and went on to become highly influential in underground film circles. Crazy Thunder Road in particular was an influential biker film, with a punk biker gang aesthetic that paved the way for Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira. Ishii's next film was the frenetic Shuffle (1981), an unofficial short film adaptation of a manga comic strip by Otomo. Ishii's most influential film was Burst City (1982). Since its release, it has had a strong effect on the underground Japanese film scene. It starred Shigeru Izumiya, who would, four years later, go on to direct his own cyberpunk film, Death Powder, in 1986. The Phantom of Regular Size, a 1986 short by Shinya Tsukamoto, was a precursor to Tetsuo: The Iron Man (1989). Tsukamoto later expanded The Phantom of Regular Size to a feature-length film three years later, in 1989. Core films Some defining films in the genre include: *Death Powder (1986) *Akira (1988) *Tetsuo: The Iron Man (1989) *964 Pinocchio (1991) *Tetsuo II: Body Hammer (1992) *Rubber's Lover (1996) Peripheral films Related films include: *Guinea Pig 5: Android of Notre Dame (1988) *Anatomia Extinction (1995) *I.K.U. (2001) *Electric Dragon 80.000 V (2001) *Hellevator: The Bottled Fools (2004) *Tsuburo no gara (2004) *Meatball Machine (2005) *Tokyo Gore Police (2008) Western influences *Eraserhead (1977) *Blade Runner (1982) *Videodrome (1983) Western films inspired by Japanese cyberpunk *Dandy Dust (1998) *Ultra-Toxic (2005) *Zoetrope (1999) *Automatons (2006) *Hikikomori: Tokyo Plastic (2004) *Flesh Computer (2014) *Computer Hearts (2015) (with direct quote from Tetsuo: The Iron Man) *Difficulty Breathing (2017) Cyberpunk manga and anime Japanese cyberpunk also refers to a subgenre of manga and anime works with cyberpunk themes. This subgenre began in 1982 with the debut of the manga series Akira, with its 1988 anime film adaptation later popularizing the subgenre. Akira inspired a wave of Japanese cyberpunk works, including manga and anime series such as Ghost in the Shell, Battle Angel Alita, Cowboy Bebop, and Serial Experiments Lain. Cyberpunk themes are widely visible in anime and manga. In Japan, where cosplay is popular and not only teenagers display such fashion styles, cyberpunk has been accepted and its influence is widespread. William Gibson's Neuromancer, whose influence dominated the early cyberpunk movement, was also set in Chiba, one of Japan's largest industrial areas. Cyberpunk anime and manga draw upon a futuristic vision which has elements in common with western science fiction and therefore have received wide international acceptance outside Japan. \\"The conceptualization involved in cyberpunk is more of forging ahead, looking at the new global culture. It is a culture that does not exist right now, so the Japanese concept of a cyberpunk future, seems just as valid as a Western one, especially as Western cyberpunk often incorporates many Japanese elements.\\"Ruh, Brian (2000), \\"Liberating Cels: Forms of the Female in Japanese Cyberpunk Animation .\\" AnimeResearch.com December 2000. William Gibson is now a frequent visitor to Japan, and he came to see that many of his visions of Japan have become a reality: > Modern Japan simply was cyberpunk. The Japanese themselves knew it and > delighted in it. I remember my first glimpse of Shibuya, when one of the > young Tokyo journalists who had taken me there, his face drenched with the > light of a thousand media-suns‚Äîall that towering, animated crawl of > commercial information‚Äîsaid, \\"You see?

Akira has been cited as a major influence on Hollywood films such as The Matrix, Dark City,Proyas, Alex. . Mystery Clock Forum. Retrieved 2006-07-29. Chronicle, Looper, Midnight Special, and Inception, television shows such as Stranger Things,Inside ‚ÄòStranger Things‚Äô: The Duffer Bros. on How They Made the TV Hit of the Summer, The Daily Beast, August 7, 2016 and video games such as Hideo Kojima's Snatcher and Metal Gear Solid, Valve's Half-Life series and Dontnod Entertainment's Remember Me. John Gaeta cited Akira as artistic inspiration for the bullet time effect in The Matrix films. Akira has also been credited with influencing the Star Wars franchise, including the prequel film trilogy and the Clone Wars film and television series. Akira has also influenced the work of musicians such as Kanye West, who paid homage to Akira in the \\"Stronger\\" music video, and Lupe Fiasco, whose album Tetsuo & Youth is named after Tetsuo Shima. The popular bike from the film, Kaneda's Motorbike, appears in Steven Spielberg's film Ready Player One, and CD Projekt's video game Cyberpunk 2077. Deus Ex: Mankind Divided video game developer Eidos Montr√©al also paid homage to the film's poster. Ghost in the Shell (1989) influenced a number of prominent filmmakers. The Wachowskis, creators of The Matrix (1999) and its sequels, showed the 1995 anime film adaptation of Ghost in the Shell to producer Joel Silver, saying, \\"We wanna do that for real.\\"Joel Silver, interviewed in \\"Making The Matrix\\" featurette on The Matrix DVD. The Matrix series took several concepts from the film, including the Matrix digital rain, which was inspired by the opening credits of Ghost in the Shell, and the way characters access the Matrix through holes in the back of their necks. Other parallels have been drawn to James Cameron's Avatar, Steven Spielberg's A.I. Artificial Intelligence, and Jonathan Mostow's Surrogates; Cameron cited Ghost in the Shell as an influence on Avatar. Ghost in the Shell also influenced video games such as the Metal Gear Solid series, Deus Ex, Oni, and Cyberpunk 2077. The original video animation Megazone 23 (1985), with its concept of a simulated reality, has a number of similarities to The Matrix, Dark City, and Existenz. Battle Angel Alita (1990) has had a notable influence on filmmaker James Cameron, who was planning to adapt it into a film since 2000. It was an influence on his TV series Dark Angel, and he is the producer of the 2018 film adaptation Alita: Battle Angel. Comic book artist Andr√© Lima Ara√∫jo cited cyberpunk manga and anime such as Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Evangelion and Cowboy Bebop as a major influence on his work, which includes Marvel comics such as Age of Ultron, Avengers A.I., Spider- Verse and The Inhumans.

Early years Weindorfer was born in Spittal an der Drau, Carinthia, an alpine province of Austria-Hungary. His father was a senior civil servant before becoming involved in the management of large agricultural estates in African colonies. Gustav was well educated, training at an agricultural college with the aim to also enter the field of agricultural management. He had some formal botany training in Austria. Weindorfer tried several and varied positions, eventually deciding to emigrate to Australia. Arrival in Australia He arrived in Melbourne on 13 June 1900. Gustav obtained a clerical position with the Austrian Lloyd Steamship Company. A desk job never fully satisfied Gustav. In 1901, his social standing was somewhat elevated when he became Honorary Chancellor of the Austro-Hungarian Consulate. During that year and the next, almost every weekend Weindorfer would stroll through the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne, or go walking in the nearby bushland with friends. On 9 September 1901, Gustav went to a meeting of the Victorian Field Naturalists Club and immediately became an enthusiastic member. One outcome of his extensive involvement with the club was the discovery of a new pea plant, now named for him, Pultenaea weindorferi.A Man and a Mountain, p12 Another was his meeting with Kate Cowle. Kate had recently moved from Tasmania, where her family had a farm at Kindred, near Devonport. Their shared enthusiasm for botany led to their marriage. The wedding occurred in Stowport on 1 February 1906. A large part of their honeymoon was spent camped on Mount Roland with the aim of making an extensive botany collection. This would have been the first time Gustav would have had a clear view of Cradle Mountain. Kate and Gustav purchased a farm at Kindred and Gustav proved to be a capable farmer. Waldheim Chalet Weindorfer's first trip to Cradle Mountain was in January 1909, with his friend and botanist mentor, Dr Sutton. A local guide led them on the last roadless stretch into the valley. Their provisions included six plant presses. Two days were spent exploring the Cradle Mountain environment. This included an attempt on the summit, but time had been used up in plant collecting and thick fog turned them back from the final climb. Over the next year, Gustav enthused about the Cradle area, describing it as a \\"veritable Eldorado for the botanist\\" and likening it to his Carinthian homeland. He returned the following summer with his wife Kate and Mr (later Major) R E Smith. On 4 January 1910, the party were graced with fine weather for their climb of the mountain. It was here that Smith later quoted Weindorfer as saying:A Man and a Mountain, p31 Weindorfer's chalet Waldheim (rebuilt) While in the valley Kate and Gustav selected a site for them to build a chalet that would allow tourists to stay in the valley. Some hundreds of acres were purchased, and in March 1912, Gustav commenced work on the building he was to call Waldheim, or \\"home in the forest\\". It was built of King Billy pine, harvested from the adjacent forest. By Christmas 1912, stage one was ready for the first visitors, with a living and dining room and two bedrooms. Despite early tourists having to walk up to to reach Waldheim, it was a success. Eventually, a rough track allowed a horse and cart to reach the valley entrance: the government was slow in responding to Weindorfer's repeated requests for a proper road. Weindorfer continued to work on his tourism dream, enlarging the chalet, naming features in the valley and clearing and marking tracks to the best spots. Death of Kate 1916 was a year of disaster for Weindorfer. His mother died in January; Kate who had been ill for some time died in April. One of his brothers died in June and then his father in October. He sold the farm at Kindred and became a full-time resident at Waldheim. His unhappiness and isolation were enhanced due to World War I and his Austrian heritage. Gustav had become an Australian citizen before his marriage, but despite this, some local groups ostracised him and people spread the foolish rumour that he was a spy. Promotion of the Area In 1921, Weindorfer set out on a tour of Tasmania to promote both Waldheim and the concept of a national park for Cradle Mountain. The following year, a scenic reserve and wildlife sanctuary was declared, stretching from Cradle Mountain to Lake St Clair. His reputation as a great host spread, but visitors came mainly in summer. Dorfer, as he became known, enjoyed company so in the many quiet times, he felt great loneliness. As the years went by, the national economic situation deteriorated, resulting in a drop in visitor numbers. Gustav had to sell timber and furs of local animals to make ends meet. Dorfer mostly cared for visitors single-handedly. This, along with the extra jobs and the cold winters, strained his health. His heart had shown a weakness in the early 1920s, and towards the end of the decade he commented in his diary \\"Strange experience. My heart acted strangely. Had to lie down in bed. I do not smoke any more. I have to give up tea...\\" Death and Remembrance Weindorfer's Tomb In April 1931 he bought a motor cycle to make travel out of the valley easier. On 5 May 1932, while trying to start the cycle, his heart gave out. He was found dead the next day, near the present Ronny Creek car park. Weindorfer had died within sight of his beloved mountain. Following his wishes, he was buried in the valley, the ceremony being conducted on 10 May 1932. In November 1932, Gustav's sister sent a bunch of everlasting flowers and four candles, asking that they be placed on his grave on New Year's Day, as was the custom in Carinthia. This simple ceremony was continued until the outbreak of World War II and subsequently revived in 1954. The current format of a memorial service on New Year's Day, along with the placing of flowers and lighting of candles, was instituted by the North West Walking Club in the early 1970s and organised by the Weindorfer Memorial Service Committee. It became necessary to use local flowers, but candles are still sent from Austria. The final service organised by the Weindorfer Memorial Service Committee was held on New Year's Day 2017. Weindorfer Service, 1 Jan 2011 In 2013, Crescendo Choir, a Tasmanian Education Department choir, commissioned Paul Jarman to compose the choral work, The Mountain, about the lives of Gustav and Kate Weindorfer. The work was premiered at the Cradle Mountain Interpretation Centre on 26 June 2016.

The museum was established in 1993, in response to efforts by local officials and volunteers to revive the shipyard area after operations at Fore River ended in 1986. Several exhibits are on board Salem relating to United States naval history and shipbuilding. Before being moved to a different pier, the museum featured dockside fixtures and a miniature golf course. History In 1986, General Dynamics Corporation shut down its shipbuilding facility at Weymouth Fore River in Quincy, signaling the end of a 102 year history of shipbuilding operations along the Fore River and 85 years at the site in Quincy Point. Various plans were offered at the time for use of the shipyard, but in 1992, a group of volunteers came up with one partial solution: the purchase and relocation of a ship built at the shipyard to be reborn as a museum celebrating the history of the yard. With help from local officials, the museum was established in 1993 by an act of the Massachusetts General Court to \\"acquire, refurbish and maintain United States naval ships and the adjacent physical complex in order that it will [serve] as a major attraction for local citizens and tourists.\\"State Library of Massachusetts Archives, 1993. After earlier attempts to obtain use of USS Lexington (CV-16), in 1994 the city and the volunteer group successfully negotiated the relocation of Salem from Philadelphia with the Naval Sea Systems Command. On 30 October 1994, Salem returned to Quincy to be permanently docked where she was built nearly five decades before. Exhibits and attractions With a length of , Salem provides a large amount of space for museum exhibits and casual exploration by visitors. The Admiral's and Captain's Bridge, Number Three Turret, Second Deck (crew quarters) and Main Deck of Salem are features of the ship proper which are open to visitors. There are also individual exhibits within the ship including the Cruiser Sailor Museum and a substantial model ship collection. The history of large cruisers like Salem is also addressed. Exhibits honoring USS Newport News (CA-148), the last of the Des Moines class cruisers, and USS Saint Paul (CA-73), a Baltimore class cruiser also built at Fore River, are on board. A portion of the museum is devoted to a display of Navy SEAL history. Researchers can request access to extensive military archives and a collection of naval armaments and memorabilia. Outside the realm of military history, the museum takes advantage of the history of the city which gave the ship its name, Salem, Massachusetts, famous for the witch trials of the late 17th century, by offering holiday themed tours and overnight stays during Halloween. Overnight stays are also available throughout the year for those interested in life aboard a Navy ship. Adjacent to the ship there was an eighteen hole miniature golf course. Operated by the museum, \\"Kilroy's Mini Golf\\" was named in honor of James J. Kilroy, a worker at the shipyard who is often cited as the origin of the famous \\"Kilroy was here\\" graffiti.

In 1987, the United States agreed to Kuwaiti requests to provide naval escorts for its tankers on the condition that the civilian ships be reflagged under U.S. flag and al-Rekkah was perforce renamed Bridgeton. On July 24, 1987, Bridgeton was part of the first Earnest Will convoy when it struck an Iranian mine near Farsi Island. The explosion breached the outer hull and the forward cargo tanks, spilling oily residue. The ship sailed to Dubai Drydock Shipyard for repairs. The mining prompted Operation Prime Chance, a secret effort to stop more minelaying. In September 1987, Iran Ajr was discovered laying mines, captured and scuttled by U.S. forces.

He made an unrivalled contribution to the development of opera-conducting in Australia and was, in Roger Covell's words, the 'first Australian-born musician to excel in this genre'. As an orchestral conductor, he was judged a 'good all-round man': he was well regarded for his enthusiasm, clarity and economy of gesture, but he was not associated with inspiring or challenging musicianship. Nonetheless, his ability to take over conducting assignments at very short notice became legendary and he was often greeted with 'rave' reviews. Early years Joseph Post was born on 10 April 1906 at Erskineville, Sydney, the eldest child of Australian-born parents. His mother was a chorister, and his father an conductor who involved himself with church choirs and suburban musical societies. He and his brothers were given the surnames of famous composers for their middle names; he was Joseph Mozart, and his brothers were John Verdi and Noel Schumann. Joseph regarded his father as his most important mentor and severest critic. Although the family had Jewish connections, Post was raised as a Roman Catholic; he later became an atheist. He attended the Christian Brothers' parish school at Waverley (now Waverley College), won a scholarship, and at age 9 was among the first students at the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music, of which he was later to become the director (1966‚Äì71). Post studied piano and oboe, and from the age of 15 he played oboe with the New South Wales State Orchestra until it was disbanded in 1922. Career Post first toured with theatre orchestras, visiting New Zealand in 1924 with one of J.C. Williamson Ltd's musical-comedy companies. By 1926 Post was teaching oboe and cor anglais at the conservatorium; later, he also offered tuition in piano. He graduated in 1927 with diplomas in performance and teaching (pianoforte). Despite such auspicious beginnings, he did not see his vocation as a teacher nor as an orchestral musician, but chose to build a career as a conductor. The elder Post gave his son extensive informal training in the conductor's art. In 1932 Post seized an opportunity to organize a 350-voice choir for the Imperial Opera Company (a touring Italian troupe) to perform in the Williamson Imperial Grand Opera Season. When the regular conductor became indisposed, Post conducted a performance of Verdi‚Äôs Aida at only a few hours' notice, which led to regular conducting appearances with the company. The establishment of the Australian Broadcasting Commission in 1932 introduced a powerful new force to the Australian music scene. Post recognized the potential of radio and accepted an offer from the ABC to form a wireless chorus in Sydney. He severed his connection with the conservatorium, did some conducting with Sir Benjamin Fuller's Royal Grand Opera Company and visited Europe in 1935. Returning to Australia, he moved to Melbourne. From 1936 to 1947 he worked for the ABC as a conductor of the Victorian Symphony Orchestra and the city's ABC wireless chorus. Whilst driving through Bairnsdale on a roadtrip from Melbourne to Sydney in 1937, Post was involved in a car crash and sustained slight injuries. Post served in World War II as a lieutenant, acting major, and commandant of the transshipment centre at Terowie, South Australia, an important staging point on the overland supply route to Darwin. He relinquished command in February 1945 and was placed on the Reserve List of Officers in March. After the war, Post continued as one of the ABC's main conductors. From 1947 to 1957 he was Associate Conductor with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, during Sir Eugene Goossens's tenure as Chief Conductor. Post made many guest appearances with ABC orchestras across Australia. He conducted the first performance of the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra on 25 May 1948; the soloist was the pianist Eileen Joyce. In 1950 he went to Britain on exchange with Charles Groves, conductor of the British Broadcasting Corporation's Northern Orchestra (now the BBC Philharmonic). At his debut at the Royal Albert Hall, Post became the first Australian to conduct at a Promenade Concert; he included a piece by the Australian composer Clive Douglas. He also conducted the Hall√© Orchestra and other British orchestras. Despite such successes, Post's career with the ABC was marred by disappointment. In 1945 he had submitted a proposal to the ABC to establish the Victorian Symphony Orchestra on a full-time basis, but he was twice overlooked for the position of principal conductor. He made no secret of his chagrin when he was not appointed director of music in 1957. Throughout his long tenure with the ABC, he never relinquished his involvement with his first love, opera. He was musical director (1947‚Äì54) of Gertrude Johnson's National Theatre Movement and principal conductor (from 1949) for its opera. In addition, Post also conducted seasons with the New South Wales National Opera in Sydney, and joint seasons of the combined opera companies in 1952. Granted leave from the ABC, he was appointed Musical Director of the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust (now Opera Australia) in 1955. He conducted the trust's first opera production, Mozart‚Äôs The Marriage of Figaro, in 1956, but resigned next year to return to the ABC as assistant director of music. Heavier administrative responsibilities did not significantly curtail the number of Post's performances. In 1963 he established the Sydney Little Symphony Orchestra and conducted its debut series of four concerts. He also continued his long association with school concerts. The advent of television broadcasting created new audiences for him. He made television appearances with the Sydney Symphony and conducted numerous operas on television. In 1962 he travelled to Europe and the USA to investigate methods of presenting music on television. At a time when most Australian classical musicians depended on success abroad, Post built a public career in Australia. He and Sir Bernard Heinze represented the first generation of native-born conductors to rise to prominence under the ABC. Post conducted when an Australian was required to support visiting celebrity musicians. The role suited his talents admirably. He was proud of his efforts to promote 'Australian' composers, releasing recordings of Raymond Hanson's Concerto for Trumpet and Orchestra (1948) and Robert Hughes's Xanadu (1954). Nor was he averse to the performance of 'new music', though his tastes could hardly be regarded as avant garde. In 1966 Post was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). That year he succeeded Heinze as director of the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music. He was the first of its former students to fill the position. He eventually put considerable effort into the conservatorium's opera school, but limited his wider involvement to consolidating initiatives begun by Heinze. Increasingly dogged by ill health, Post resigned from the conservatorium in late 1971 and moved to the Gold Coast, Queensland. He died of myocardial disease on 27 December 1972 at Broadbeach and was cremated. At St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne, on 12 May 1943 he had married Nancye Lille Tucker, a 28-year-old stenographer. His wife and their daughter Nola survived him. He had actively discouraged Nola from any sort of musical training.

Also known as the Kapa Kapa-Jaure Track, the trail runs parallel to but southeast of the more well-known and more accessible Kokoda Track. The Kapa Kapa Track is more than twice as long as the Kokoda Track and at its highest point, , is more than higher. Total ascent and descent is around . Because the track is very steep, difficult, and unimproved, it has been hiked by very few non-native individuals. During World War II, more than 900 members of the United States 126th Infantry Regiment, 32nd Infantry Division trekked across it in 42 days in an attempt to flank the Japanese on the Kokoda Track. They endured an extraordinarily difficult march, and the majority of the men became ill with malaria, dengue fever, bush typhus, and tropical dysentery. It was \\"one of the most harrowing marches in American military history.\\" They never saw a Japanese soldier during their nearly month-long trek. After only a week of recuperation, the Battalion was immediately put on the front line against battle-hardened Japanese troops and in the ensuing battle soon ran short of weapons, medicine and even food.  Name origin  The name \\"Kapa Kapa\\" is an English mispronunciation of Gabagaba, the coastal village where the route begins on south coast of Papua New Guinea.  32nd Infantry Division march  Japanese thrust along the Kokoda Trail 22 July - 16 September 1942 During the early stages of World War II, Australian Army units in the Kokoda Track campaign were under increasing pressure from Japanese forces that had advanced to within of Port Moresby. On 9 September, the Australian 6th Division's 16th Infantry Brigade was ordered from Australia to Port Moresby. The 25th Brigade, which had just arrived in Port Moresby, was immediately pushed to the front. General Sydney Rowell felt he could contain the Japanese with the extra troops, but MacArthur was anxious to flank the Japanese. He asked his staff to plan a flanking maneuver that would push the Japanese off the mountains more quickly. Other Japanese units were routed to seize Samarai, an island south of Milne Bay, from which they would launch a seaborne invasion of Port Moresby. When they found that the Allies were building up Milne Bay at the southernmost tip of New Guinea, they chose to attack it instead. This effort was blunted by a vigorous Allied defense, and the Japanese withdrew on the night of 4‚Äì5 September 1942.  Decision to flank the Japanese  Since the 32nd Infantry Division had to move to another camp in any event, General Douglas MacArthur felt they should be the first to move to New Guinea. The 32nd Division's commanding General Edwin Harding told MacArthur he didn't believe the division was ready, as it had received limited training and virtually no jungle warfare training. At that time, divisions were expected to train as a unit for one year before entering combat. MacArthur nonetheless pressed Harding for a unit that could be moved to the front. Harding told MacArthur that the 126th Infantry Regiment commanded by Col. Lawrence A. Quinn was the best-trained and best-led, and it was selected for the task. The unit was ordered to prepare to move immediately, and a Brisbane cleaning establishment was given the task of dyeing the men's khaki battle fatigues a mottled green to prepare for jungle action. Only later did the troops learn that the dye used did not allow the fabric to breathe, causing sores to the skin of the men.  First route impractical  Brigadier General Hanford MacNider, in charge of the G-4 (Logistics) unit in MacArthur's headquarters group, learned almost immediately upon his arrival in Port Moresby that the previously chosen route to Wairopi across the peninsula, proposed by headquarters staff, was not practical. It traversed the Australian's rear area and a region where the soldiers could be cut off by the Japanese. It was also so mountainous that the only way they could receive supplies would be by air. Two alternative routes were considered, from Kapa Kapa to Jaure, and from Abau to Jaure. From Jaure other minor trails would lead the soldiers to Wairopi and Buna.  New route surveyed  General MacNider dispatched two groups to reconnoiter the routes. He assigned the Southwest Pacific Area chief of the Construction Section, Colonel Leif Sverdrup, to survey the route from Abau on the coast of southern New Guinea. Sverdrup set out for Jaure with a party of one American, two Australians from the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit, ten native police from the Royal Papuan Constabulary and 26 native carriers. After eight days on the trail, scaling heights of , Sverdrup concluded that it would not be practical for troops to traverse the route and turned back, reaching Abau on 3 October. Sverdrup soon reported that the trail starting from Abau was difficult for marching and impossible for pack animals. The Allies canceled plans to send the 127th Infantry Regiment over this route. Closer to Port Moresby, Captain William F. Boice (Division S-2) and Lieutenant Bernard Howes took a detachment to survey the Kapa Kapa Trail, beginning in Kapa Kapa (a mispronunciation of Gabagaba, the coastal village where the route begins). From Kapa Kapa, the trail reaches Kalikodobu, Arapara, Laruni, and then Jaure. The route was roughly parallel to but about south of the Kokoda Trail. They, along with six men from Company E of the 126th, and some forty native porters, begun the survey of the trail in October 1942. The men soon learned that the dye applied to their uniforms in Australia caused the material to trap heat. There was extremely little intelligence available about the route. The natives avoided it as they thought it was haunted, especially at the crest. No white man had used the route since 1917. The troops could be supported logistically by land and sea for about a third of the distance, after which they would depend on air drops. But the trail was barely a goat path. The untamed jungle terrain was extremely steep, cut by razor-sharp hogback ridges and required the men to cross a mountain divide. The Australians didn't think it was practical for men to cross on foot. Boice nonetheless reported back that the route was feasible, and the 2nd Battalion, 126th Infantry Regiment was committed to the trail.  March started  Members of the 2nd Battalion, 126th Infantry Regiment, U.S. 32nd Division, in an Army Bantam Jeep crossing a river on the southern portion of the Kapa Kapa Trail in Papua New Guinea during October 1942. Though poorly equipped and unprepared for the task, engineers and soldiers had managed to build a road from Port Moresby along the coast to Kapa Kapa (Gabagaba). From Kapa Kapa, the engineers carved out a road first to Kalikodobu, nicknamed \\"Kalamazoo\\" by the GIs who had a hard time pronouncing the local name. At Kalamazoo, Major Baetcke was in charge of completing a forward supply base at Arapara, inland another by trail. The 32nd Division established a Command Post at Kalamazoo in early October. After Kalikodobu the road was much rougher, reaching a total of inland to Nepeana. Parts of it were unfinished, although four-wheel drive Bantam Jeeps could complete the route. Parts were so steep and rough that natives were recruited to carry supplies inland. Most of the 2nd Battalion, 126th Infantry, was moved to Nepeana, and on 6 October 250 men from the Antitank and Cannon companies along with 100 porters left under the command of Captain Alfred Mendendorp. They were expected to march two miles per day. Their job was to establish locations for dropzones where the troops could be resupplied. They discovered that Boice's description of the track as \\"feasible\\" was misleading. The trail was a slow, exhausting march through the thick jungles and up to the cold, dense forests on the shoulder of Ghost Mountain, known locally as Suwemalla' or more officially as 'Mt. Obree'. Mendendorp arrived at the mountain top village of Larum on 13 October and established an air supply point. He then left for Jaure away, but taking another week to complete the trek. Beginning on 14 October, the remaining 900 troops of the 2nd Battalion, 126th Infantry, along with the 114th Engineer Battalion, 19th Portable Hospital, commanded by Capt Bernard Friedenthal M.D. and the 107th Quartermaster Company, commanded by Lt. Col. Henry A. Geerds, left Kalamazoo over several days on foot, assisted by several hundred native porters and guides. So rough was the journey ahead that they became the only Americans to trek over divide over the extremely rugged Owen Stanley Mountains on foot. Allied advance across Owen Stanley Range 26 September - 15 November 1942. They were charged with making an extremely difficult trek inland over the Kapa Kapa Trail toward Jaure, where they were to flank the Japanese on the Kokoda Trail. The total distance over the mountains to the Japanese positions was over , and most of the trail was barely a goat path. The men carried only six days rations, expecting to be resupplied en route. The food however was very poor, including hardtack, rice and bully beef, some of which had become rancid and sickening many men. They had leather toilet seats but no machetes, insect repellent, waterproof containers for medicine or personal effects, and it rained heavily every day. When they received quinine pills, water chlorination tablets, vitamin pills, or salt tablets, usually a few days supply, they began to disintegrate almost as soon as the men put them in their pockets or packs.  Difficult terrain  Dense forest jungle on mountain spurs of the Owen Stanley Range, Bulldog Track, Papua New Guinea The men found themselves utterly unprepared for the extremely harsh conditions found in the jungle. The Kapa Kapa trail across the Owen Stanley divide was a \\"dank and eerie place, rougher and more precipitous\\" than the Kokoda Track on which the Australians and Japanese were then fighting. Chiggers, fleas, sand flies, leeches, and mosquitoes found every inch of exposed skin. They rapidly began to discard anything they didn't absolutely need, including raincoats, helmets, blankets, even ammunition. Members of the mortar company first left their base plates behind, then the tubes, and finally all of the ammunition. One group lost its footing and slid downhill in 40 minutes; it took them eight hours to climb back to where they began.  Nicknamed The Ghost Battalion  Their field craft showed the lack of training, and malaria, dengue fever, bush typhus, amoebic dysentery, bacillary, along with jungle rot, dobie itch, trench foot, athlete's foot and ringworm quickly struck hundreds of men. Their rate of advance compared to the Australian soldiers was considerably slower. It rained hard every afternoon at about three o'clock, and beginning on 15 October they were drenched by five days of steady rain. Constant tropical downpours, searing heat, and dripping humidity left the soldiers constantly wet. At night in the higher altitudes, temperatures dropped rapidly, leaving the men chilled. Lead elements of the 126th finally crossed the pass in the extremely rugged Owen Stanley Mountains near Mount Obree, which they nicknamed Ghost Mountain. To avoid becoming illegal combatants in the League of Nations mandate trust territory of New Guinea, the remaining Australian Papuan native porters would not cross the border at the top of the range. The Americans were left to shoulder their own packs weighing up to . They finally crossed the last ridge and after 29 days the initial units reached Jaure on 25 October 1942. Captain Boice, scouting ahead, had reached this village on 4 October. They began to depart from Jaure on 28 October. Captain Boice could not find a single good place for aircraft to drop supplies between Jaure and Natunga in the steep foothills northeast of Jaure, leading to the Buna area. During their five-day trek to Natunga, most of the troops' rations dropped between those two points were lost. The men were reduced to eating bananas and papayas or whatever else they could find or had gone hungry. They finally reached the Natunga area on 2 November. There, they spent more than a week drawing rations, helmets, boots, and other equipment before pushing on to Gora and Bofu, which they reached on 12 November. On 20 November 1942, after almost 42 days trekking across exceedingly difficult terrain, including hogback ridges, jungle, and mountainous high-altitude passes, E Company of the 128th was the first to reach Soputa near the front. The remainder of the Battalion trickled in over the next few days. As a result of the extremely difficult march and the decimated ranks of the unit, the battalion earned the nickname of The Ghost Battalion. By the time the troops reached Soputa, they were in such bad shape they weren't fit for combat. Their new commanding officer, Major Herbert Smith said, \\"They were even lucky to be alive.\\" Smith had replaced Major Garnet J. Burlingame as Battalion Commander due to Burlingame suffering a fractured spine from a fall along the trail. Smith arrived and replaced Burlingame on 30 October 1942, after 2nd Battalion had crossed over the Owen Stanley mountains. No other troops were tasked with making the same trek.  128th airlifted  Midway through their march, Cecil Abel, a local missionary arrived in Port Moresby with information that usable airfield sites were available on the far side of the Owen Stanley Range at Fasari in the Musa River valley and at Pongani. By 2 November Blamey persuaded MacArthur to transport the remainder of the 32nd Division by air. In a first for World War II, the rest of the 128th Infantry was flown from Australia to New Guinea, the greatest distance the Army Air Force had airlifted men up to that time. Battery A of the 129th Field Artillery, 32nd Division had been sent to New Guinea, while the remaining batteries remained at Camp Cable in Australia. In another first, the four gun sections were the first howitzers flown into a war, first landing at Port Moresby. Then one-half of Battery A, 129th Field Artillery, was air- lifted over the Owen Stanley Range to Buna, becoming the first U.S. Army artillery flown into combat in the Pacific in World War II.  Aftermath  The attempt to flank the Japanese failed. The troops never encountered a single Japanese troop on their trek and were unable due to the terrain to offer any support to the Australians on the Kokoda Track. The Australians were by then preparing to attack the Japanese who had retreated all the way to the fortified Buna coast. By the time the 2/126th Infantry Regiment completed their trek, they were considerably under strength. Seventy percent of the 900 men had contracted malaria. Meanwhile, on 14‚Äì18 October, the U.S. 128th Infantry Regiment had been flown from Port Moresby to Wanigela, where they began to hike north the short-distance overland towards Buna. The U.S. 1st Battalion, 126th Infantry Regiment were flown on 8 November to Fasari, where an airfield had been located, and they began moving towards the coast and Pongani. The U.S. 1/126th, 128th, with the Australian 2/10th Battalion engaged the Japanese on 18 November at Buna-Gona. Despite the extremely poor condition of the 2/126th, General MacArthur was desperate for men to put on the line, and after only a week of recuperation, he ordered them to the Buna-Gona to face battle-hardened Japanese troops on 20 November. The division had never received adequate equipment, training, and preparation for the task they were given and were chronically short of basic supplies. Harding requested tanks and artillery support but MacArthur was persuaded by General Kenney that the Army Air Force could replace the role of artillery. The Battalion soon ran short of weapons, medicine and even food. General Harding was relieved of command after only 13 days because MacArthur thought the men were unwilling to fight.

He was an older contemporary of Dante Alighieri and active in Florence. He may have been a Proven√ßal- or Auvergnat- speaker from Maillane (the birthplace of Fr√©d√©ric Mistral), but more probably he was from the Tuscan village of Maiano near Fiesole. In 1882 Adolfo Borgognoni argued that he was an invention of Renaissance philology, but met with the opposition of F. Novati in 1883 and Giovanni Bertacchi in 1896. Bertacchi argued that Dante da Maiano was the same person as the Dante Magalante, son of ser Ugo da Maiano, who appears in a public record of 1301. At the time this Dante was living in the monastery of San Benedetto in Alpe and was requested in mundualdum by a relative of his, Lapa, widow of Vanni di Chello Davizzi, to be her tutor. That a Dante da Maiano existed during the lifetime of Dante Alighieri and that he was capable of \\"tutoring\\" was thus established, but the identification with the poet could not be made certain. Santorre Debenedetti finally disproved Borgognoni's thesis in 1907.Michael Papio (2004), \\"Dante da Maiano\\", Medieval Italy: An Encyclopedia, Christopher Kleinhenz and John W. Barker, edd. (London: Routledge), p. 290. He discovered two Occitan sonnets ascribed to Dante da Maiano in a fifteenth-century Italian manuscript conserved in the Biblioteca Laurentiana, Florence.The manuscript, in cursive on paper, known as troubadour c, is Laurenziano XC. inf. 26. Almost all Dante's extant work is preserved in the Giuntina (or \\"Junte\\"), a Florentine chansonnier compiled in 1527 under the title Sonetti e canzoni di diversi avtori toscani in dieci libri raccolte by Filippo Giunti.\\"Sonnets and songs by diverse Tuscan authors, collected in ten books\\". His total work is some forty-eight sonnets, five ballate, two canzoni, and a series of tenzoni with Dante Alighieri. He was influenced by the troubadours (notably Bernart de Ventadorn), the Sicilian School and in particular Giacomo da Lentini, the Tuscan School of Guittone d'Arezzo, and the later dolce stil novo, though he belongs to none of these. Rosanna Betarrini calls his work a \\"pastiche\\" and Antonio Enzo Quaglio a silloge archeologica della produzione anteriore e contemporanea (\\"an archaeological collection of past and contemporary production\\").P. Stoppelli, \\"Dante da Maiano\\", Dizionario biografico degli Italiani, XXXII (Rome: Societ√† Grafica Romana, 1986), p. 656. Dante da Maiano wrote a sonnet in response to A ciascun' alma presa e gentil core, the first sonnet in Dante Alighieri's Vita nuova.Guido Cavalcanti and Terino da Castelfiorentino also responded to Alighieri (Stopppelli, 657). There was also a five-part exchange (probably preceding the Vita nuova) called the duol d'amore (\\"dolour of love\\"), in which Dante da Maiano wrote three pieces and Dante Alighieri responded to the first two.The name duol d'amore comes from F. Pelligrini and is not original. In a final two-part communication, Dante Alighieri wrote Savere e cortesia, ingegno ed arte to Dante da Maiano's Amor mi fa s√¨ fedelmente amare. In all their correspondence, the elder Dante assumes an air of superiority towards his up-and-coming interlocutor, the future author of the Divine Comedy.Stoppelli, 657. Before Dante Alighieri's career had taken off, the elder Dante was for a time quite famous in Florence for his sonnet Provedi, saggio, ad esta vis√Øone, in which he recounts a dream he had and asks his fellow citizens for an interpretation. Chiaro Davanzati, Guido Orlandi, Salvino Doni, Ricco da Varlungo, Cino da Pistoja and Dante Alighieri, in what was to be his earliest still-extant poem, all responded. Dante da Maiano, along with Cino da Pistoja, also wrote a response to a sonnet (Guido, vorrei che tu e Lapo ed io) that Alighieri sent to his friend Guido Cavalcanti. According to later stories now generally accepted as only legend, Dante also kept up a correspondence with Nina of Sicily,She is only called Monna Nina by Dante, the \\"of Sicily\\" coming from Leo Allatius, Poeti antichi (Naples: 1661). the first Italian poetess, and with whom he fell in love. Their relationship became well-known and she grew in fame because of his writings so that she was called la Nina di Dante. She took up poetry, apparently, as a result of his influence. V√≠ctor Balaguer published the Occitan sonnet Las! so qe m'es el cor plus fis e qars in 1879, where he also hypothesised for Dante a birthplace in Provence. Despite these Occitan sonnets and Dante's more probable birthplace in Tuscany, Giulio Bertoni disqualified Dante from being an \\"Italian troubadour\\" in his 1915 study.Giulio Bertoni (1967), I Trovatori d'Italia: Biografie, testi, tradizioni, note (Rome: Societ√† Multigrafica Editrice Somu). By one reckoning, Dante's Occitan sonnets are the earliest examples of what is undisputedly an Italian form, but the invention of which is usually assigned to Giacomo da Lentini.Henry John Chaytor (1912), The Troubadours (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), p. 106.

Const. Providentissima Mater Ecclesia See also Canon Law-Codification and Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches. Pope John XXIII, when proclaiming a new ecumenical council for the Catholic Church, also announced the intention of revising the 1917 CIC. It was not feasible to revise the Code of Canon Law until after the conclusion of the Second Vatican Council, so that the decisions of the Council could guide the revision of ecclesiastical laws. Several of the council documents gave specific instructions regarding changes to the organization of the Catholic Church, in particular the decrees Christus Dominus, Presbyterorum Ordinis, Perfectae Caritatis, and Ad gentes. In 1966, Pope Paul VI issued norms to apply these instructions through the motu proprio Ecclesiae Sanctae. The Pontificia Commissio Codici iuris canonici recognoscendo, which had been established in 1963, continued the work of revising the Code of Canon Law through the pontificate of Paul VI, completing the work in the first years of the pontificate of John Paul II.

It entered into force the first Sunday of the following Advent, which was 27 November 1983. In an address given on November 21, 1983 to the participants in a course at the Gregorian University in Rome on the new Code of Canon Law, the Pope described the new Code as \\"the last document of Vatican II\\".

The 1917 Pio-Benedictine Code was in fact structured according to the Roman law division of \\"norms, persons, things, procedures, penalties\\". The 1983 Code, in total contrast, was deliberately given a much more doctrinal- theological structure. John Paul II described the ecclesiological inspiration of the Code in this way: Thus the 1983 Code is configured, as far as possible, according to the \\"mystery of the Church\\", the most significant books ‚Äì Two, Three and Four ‚Äì corresponding to the munus regendi, the munus sanctificandi, and the munus docendi (the \\"missions\\" of governance, of worship/sanctification, and of teaching) which in turn derive from the kingly, the priestly and the prophetic roles or functions of Christ.Confer \\"CANON LAW AND COMMUNIO Writings on the Constitutional Law of the Church\\", 1, 1, at .

Outline This is the outline of the seven books of the 1983 Code of Canon Law. * BOOK I. GENERAL NORMS (Cann. 1‚Äì203) : Explains the general application of laws * BOOK II. THE PEOPLE OF GOD (Cann. 204‚Äì746) : Goes into the rights and obligations of laypeople and clergy, and outlines the hierarchical organization of the Church * BOOK III. THE TEACHING FUNCTION OF THE CHURCH (Cann. 747‚Äì833) : Christian ministry, missionary activity, education, and social communication * BOOK IV. THE SANCTIFYING FUNCTION OF THE CHURCH (Cann. 834‚Äì1253) : Sacraments and other acts of worship; places of worship; feast-days and fast-days * BOOK V. THE TEMPORAL GOODS OF THE CHURCH (Cann. 1254‚Äì1310) : Ownership, contracts, and wills; akin to the civil Business Law * BOOK VI. SANCTIONS IN THE CHURCH (Cann. 1311‚Äì1399) : Crimes and punishment * BOOK VII PROCESSES (Cann. 1400‚Äì1752) : Procedural law; trials and tribunals; special processes; penal procedures; administrative procedures Summary Book I. General Norms (Cann. 1‚Äì203) This part of the Codex contains the general rules concerning *legal sources *physical and juridic persons *governance and offices *the computation of time Legal sources are laws (including custom as a special way of legislation because of the need of the approval of the legislator), which contain universal regulations, general decrees (legislative or executory), instructions and statutes which refer to a special group, and in case of statutes are legislated by this group itself, and administrative acts, which only decide single cases. Persons are physical persons or juridic persons. Not everyone is considered a \\"physical person\\" according to the definition of the 1983 Code, because one is constituted a person with consequent duties and rights only by baptism. The Codex specifies conditions for the validity of a juridical act, especially in relation to form, coercion, misapprehension and lack of participation. Legal power is divided into the three authorities of legislative, executive and judicial. The ability to conduct juridical acts can be attached to an office or it can be delegated to a person. Appointment and loss of ecclesiastical office are regulated. Time regulates prescription, which goes along with the national regulations, but can only be achieved in good faith, and definitions of time. Book II. The People of God (Cann. 204‚Äì746) Book two describes the \\"People of God\\". It discusses the general rights and obligations of members of the church, and then discusses the ordering of the church, from the Holy See to the local parish. The hierarchical constitution of religious and secular institutes and societies of apostolic life is shown to a degree adequate to explain the scope of applicability of the regulations of part two. A religious institute is a society in which members, according to proper law, pronounce public vows. This book is divided into three parts: *The Christian faithful *The hierarchical constitution of the church *Institutes of consecrated life and societies of apostolic life. The Christian faithful shows the obligations of the faithful in common, those of the lay and those of the sacred ministers or clerics with special consideration of the formation and incardination and excardination of clerics and personal prelatures. Furthermore, the associations of the Christian faithful especially their recognition as a juridic person are constituted, divided in public, private associations and those of the lay. Part II is entitled, \\"The Hierarchical Constitution of the Church\\". This part describes the composition, rights and obligations of the Supreme Authority of the Church, consisting of the Roman Pontiff, the College of Bishops, the Synod of Bishops, the College of Cardinals, the Roman Curia and the Papal legates. A secular institute is an institute of consecrated life in which the Christian faithful, living in the world, strive for the perfection of charity and seek to contribute to the sanctification of the world, especially from within. Societies of apostolic life do not use a vow. Book III. The Teaching Function of the Church (Cann. 747‚Äì833) Book III describes the teaching function of the church. The forms of teaching are the ministry of the Divine Word in the forms of the preaching of the word of God and the catechetical instruction, the missionary action of the church, the Catholic education in schools, Catholic universities and other institutes of higher studies and the ecclesiastical universities and faculties, the instruments of communication and books in particular and finally the profession of faith. Book IV. The Sanctifying Office of the Church (cann. 834‚Äì1123) In book four the function of the church and its religious acts are explained. This book is composed of three parts *the sacraments *the other acts of divine worship *sacred places and times The sacraments are baptism, confirmation, the most holy Eucharist, penance, anointing of the sick, holy orders and marriage. These sacraments are described with conditions, ceremony and participants. Other acts of divine worship are sacramentals, the liturgy of the hours, ecclesiastical funerals, the veneration of the saints, sacred images and relics and the vow and oath. Sacred places are those which are dedicated for divine worship or for the burial of the faithful. The Code knows five kinds of sacred places: churches, oratories and private chapels, shrines, altars and cemeteries. Sacred times are holy days of obligation, feast days and days of penance. IntraText, accessed Jan-11-2013 Book V. The Temporal Goods of the Church (Cann. 1254‚Äì1310) This part of the Corpus Juris is the regulation of the civil law. There are instructions concerning the acquisition and administration of goods especially the acquisition by bestowal either through an act inter vivos or through an act mortis causa and contracts with special care of alimentation. Book VI. Sanctions in the Church (Cann. 1311‚Äì1399) Book VI contains the canonical equivalent to secular criminal law. The book has two parts: *Delicts and penalties in general *Penalties for individual delicts The first part declares the necessity of a violation of a law and shows the limits and requirements of such a penal law. It determines reasons, which eliminate the punishment as lack the use of reason, nonage (less than seventeen years), mistake in law or facts, missing causality or intent and self-defence. It also describes social cases as complicity, wilful default and attempt. Possible penalties are censures (excommunication and suspension), expiatory penalties (prohibition or an order concerning residence in a certain place or territory, privation of a power, office, function, right, privilege, faculty, favor, title or insignia) and penal remedies and penances. Finally the right of the application and cessation of penalties is regulated The second part shows individual delicts, divided into delicts against religion and unity of the church, those against ecclesiastical authorities and the freedom of the church, those against special obligations, those against human life and freedom, usurpation of ecclesiastical functions and delicts in their exercise, and the crime of falsehood. In addition to these cases (and those stated in other laws) the external violation of a divine or canonical law can be punished when the special gravity of the violation demands punishment and there is an urgent need to prevent or repair scandals. Book VII. Processes (Cann. 1400‚Äì1752) Book VII contains the legal procedure. It is divided in 5 parts. * Trials in general * The contentious trial * Special processes * The penal process * The method of proceeding in hierarchical recourse and in the removal or transfer of pastors =Part I= The first part trials in general defines the court system, its two local instances and the Roman Pontiff as the supreme judge with the representation by the tribunals of the Apostolic See, especially the Roman Rota. It determines the participants of the lawsuit, the judge, the auditors and relators, the promoter of justice, the Defender of the Bond, the notary, the petitioner, the respondent, and the procurators for litigation and advocates. Finally it describes the discipline to be observed in tribunals, with the duty of judges and ministers, the order of adjudication, the time limits and delays, the place of the trial, the persons to be admitted to the court, the manner of preparing and keeping the acts, and the actions and exceptions in general and specific. =Part II= The contentious trial begins with the introductory libellus of litigation and the citation and notification of juridical act. The joinder of the issue occurs when the terms of the controversy are defined by the judge, through a decree of the judge. Further on, this part explains the trial of the litigation, especially the absence of a party, the intervention of a third person and the proofs. There are six kinds of proof: declarations of the parties, documents, testimonies, experts, judicial examination and inspection, and presumptions. After taking evidence the acts are published, the case concluded and then discussed. The case ends with the sentence of the judge. The sentence can be challenged by complaint of nullity and by appeal. Finally the res judicata and restitutio in integrum, the execution of the judgement, the judicial expenses and gratuitous legal assistance are regulated. As an alternative to this contentious trial there is the possibility of an oral contentious process. =Part III= Part three defines special processes and their special regulations, the process for declaring the nullity of marriage, cases of separation of spouses, process for the dispensation from a marriage ratum sed non consummatum, the process in the presumed death of spouses, and cases for declaring the nullity of sacred ordination. This part also shows methods of avoiding trials. =Part IV= Part four shows the proceedings of the penal process, with the preliminary investigation, the trial, and the adhesive procedure. =Part V= The last part shows the methods of proceeding in administrative recourse, which can be made by any person who claims to have been aggrieved by a decree, and the removal or transfer of pastors with display of the reasons for the removal or transfer. The final canon, 1752, ends with the teleological and juridical principle that the supreme law of the Church is the salvation of souls (commonly formulated Salus animarum lex suprema est.) Amendments After the promulgation of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, popes have amended it six times, with changes to 41 canons in total (111, 112, 535, 694, 729, 750, 838, 868, 1008, 1009, 1086, 1108, 1109, 1111, 1112, 1116, 1117, 1124, 1127, 1371, and 1671‚Äì1691). =1. Ad tuendam fidem= On 18 May 1998 Pope John Paul II issued the motu proprio Ad tuendam fidem, which amended two canons (750 and 1371) of the 1983 Code of Canon Law and also two canons (598 and 1436) of the 1990 Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, so as to add \\"new norms which expressly impose the obligation of upholding truths proposed in a definitive way by the Magisterium of the Church, and which also establish related canonical sanctions.\\" =2. Omnium in mentem= On 26 October 2009 Pope Benedict XVI issued the motu proprio Omnium in Mentem, which amended five canons (1008, 1009, 1086, 1117, 1124) of the 1983 Code of Canon Law clarifying that, among those in Holy Orders, only bishops and priests received the power and mission to act in the person of Christ the Head while deacons obtained the faculty to exercise the diakonias of service, Word, and charity. The amendments also removed formal defection from the Catholic faith as excusing Catholics from the canonical form of marriage. =3. Mitis Iudex Dominus Iesus= On 15 August 2015 Pope Francis issued the motu proprio Mitis Iudex Dominus Iesus, which amended twenty-one canons (1671‚Äì1691) to reform the process of determining matrimonial nullity. The document was made public on 8 September 2015.Pope Francis reforms Church law in marital nullity trials, Vatican Radio, accessed 8 September 2015 =4. De concordia inter codices= On 31 May 2016 Pope Francis issued the motu proprio De concordia inter codices, which amended ten canons (111, 112, 535, 868, 1108, 1109, 1111, 1112, 1116 and 1127) to reconcile the norms of the Code of Canon Law with those of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches. He did so after consultation with a committee of experts in Eastern and Latin canon law organized by the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts. =5. Magnum principium= On 3 September 2017 Pope Francis issued the motu proprio Magnum principium, which amended one canon (838) to grant episcopal conferences authority over liturgical translations. =6. Communis vita= On 19 March 2019, Pope Francis issued an apostolic letter given motu proprio Communis vita.Pope Francis: New rules for religious life, VaticanNews.va, accessed 26 March 2019. It institutes ipso facto dismissal of religious who are absent for a full year illegitimately from their religious house. It replaces canons 694 and 729 in their entirety, with a vacatio legis of 10 April 2019. Notable canons Canon 97 reduces the canonical age of majority from 21 to 18, according to the consensus of civil law. Canon 332 governs papal resignations Canons 823 to 824 obliges bishops to censor material concerning faith or morals. Canon 844 regulates communicatio in sacris. Canon 915 forbids the administration of Holy Communion to those upon whom the penalty of excommunication or interdict has been imposed or declared or who obstinately persist in manifest grave sin. Canon 916 prohibits clergy in mortal sin from celebrating Mass, and forbids laypeople in mortal sin from receiving the Eucharist, except when they have a grave reason and there is no opportunity to confess, in which case they must make an Act of Perfect Contrition and confess their mortal sins as soon as possible. Canon 919 ¬ß1 establishes a one-hour fast before the reception of the Eucharist (this fast does not include water or medicine).

It has also been variously translated as \\"When Will the Gentleman Come Back Again?\\" or \\"When Will You Come Back Again?\\" The lyrics were written by Huang Jiamo () set to a tune composed by Liu Xue'an. Background Composition According to Liu Xue'an's son, the tune was written by his father at an undergraduate party at the Shanghai Music Conservatory, during which an impromptu song-composition competition was suggested. Liu wrote the melody quickly, played it as a tango song and won the approval of other students., citing , p. 231 The director Fang Peilin (d. 1949?) liked the tune, and asked Bei Lin (later identified as Huang Jiamo) to write the lyrics to be used for his new film., citing , pp. 230‚Äì231 Controversy The song was highly popular as well as controversial. The controversy arose due to the various interpretations and political readings of its supposed \\"hidden\\" meaning. The lyrics were interpreted as either anti-Japanese, treasonous, or pornographic. After 1949 the song was banned by the People's Republic of China because it was seen as bourgeois and decadent. The writer Liu was criticized and suffered during the Anti-Rightist Movement in 1957 and during the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s. He offered a public self-criticism in 1980 before he was rehabilitated, but criticism of the song continued in mainland China for some time as an example of \\"Yellow Music\\", a product of decadent and immoral society. This song was also banned in Taiwan during the martial law period because the word j≈´n () \\"gentleman\\" (here used to address the person, therefore translated as \\"you\\") sounds the same as the word j≈´n (, meaning \\"army\\"), therefore censors feared that people may associate the song with People's Liberation Army. Zhou Xuan's original version The song was originally sung by Zhou Xuan and first appeared as an accompaniment to the film Three Stars by the Moon (), a 1937 film directed by Fang Peilin and produced by the Yihua film company. The film was one of the last silent movies made in China, and the only silent movie Zhou Xuan starred in. The songs in the film were probably played to the audience on a gramophone synchronized with the action. Teresa Teng's version The song became heavily associated with Teresa Teng through her version, released in 1979, so that she has supplanted Zhou Xuan as \\"the primary singer identified with this song\\". In Mainland China too, Teng became prominent via the song. Geremie R. Barm√©, author of In the Red: On Contemporary Chinese Culture, described the song as a \\"nostalgic ode\\". Barm√© said that some individuals on the Mainland condemned the song, describing it as \\"traitorous\\" and \\"obscene\\". Memorials for Teng have included performances of \\"When Will You Return?\\" Other versions Zhou's colleague, actress Li Lili performed the song in Cai Chusheng's film Orphan Island Paradise Â≠§Â≥∂Â§©Â†Ç (1939). The song was translated into Japanese and sung by Hamako Watanabe (1940), and was re-released by Li Xianglan the following year; Li (aka Yamaguchi Yoshiko) was fluent in both Chinese and Japanese, and also performed Chinese versions. The song has been recorded by Judy Ongg, Fei Yu- ching, Lisa Ono, Claire Kuo and many others. Mitsuki Takahata sang it as the title track to the film Itsu mata kimi to (2017). A rendition entitled ‚ÄúWaiting for Your Return‚Äù by Jasmine Chen played during the opening credit of the film Crazy Rich Asians (2018).

It is most commonly employed in quantum mechanical simulations of the electronic band structure in solids. The approximation was proposed by John C. Slater. Augmented plane wave method (APW) is a method which uses muffin-tin approximation. It is a method to approximate the energy states of an electron in a crystal lattice. The basic approximation lies in the potential in which the potential is assumed to be spherically symmetric in the muffin-tin region and constant in the interstitial region. Wave functions (the augmented plane waves) are constructed by matching solutions of the Schr√∂dinger equation within each sphere with plane-wave solutions in the interstitial region, and linear combinations of these wave functions are then determined by the variational method. Many modern electronic structure methods employ the approximation. Among them APW method, the linear muffin-tin orbital method (LMTO) and various Green's function methods. One application is found in the variational theory developed by Jan Korringa (1947) and by Walter Kohn and N. Rostoker (1954) referred to as the KKR method. This method has been adapted to treat random materials as well, where it is called the KKR coherent potential approximation. In its simplest form, non-overlapping spheres are centered on the atomic positions. Within these regions, the screened potential experienced by an electron is approximated to be spherically symmetric about the given nucleus. In the remaining interstitial region, the potential is approximated as a constant. Continuity of the potential between the atom- centered spheres and interstitial region is enforced. In the interstitial region of constant potential, the single electron wave functions can be expanded in terms of plane waves. In the atom-centered regions, the wave functions can be expanded in terms of spherical harmonics and the eigenfunctions of a radial Schr√∂dinger equation. Such use of functions other than plane waves as basis functions is termed the augmented plane-wave approach (of which there are many variations). It allows for an efficient representation of single-particle wave functions in the vicinity of the atomic cores where they can vary rapidly (and where plane waves would be a poor choice on convergence grounds in the absence of a pseudopotential).

After 1972 the firm pursued an aggressive expansion strategy, first by absorbing two other Omaha firms and then by adding offices in other cities, beginning in 1977 with offices in Denver and Washington, D.C.

Federal legislation in 1968 required American industry and business to commit to massive expenditures over the next two decades to address water and air pollution abatement requirements of that legislation. In conjunction with its Wall Street investment banking clients, Kutak Rock pioneered the use of municipal debt backed solely by the relevant corporate credit (a form of transaction at that time known as industrial development revenue bond financing) to finance tens of billions of dollars of these requirements, thus establishing the foundation of the broad-ranging corporate and governmental finance practice that exists today in all of the firm‚Äôs offices. The firm's national corporate, real estate and litigation practices also began during this period. Robert Kutak, a founder of the firm, chaired the American Bar Association commission which developed the new Model Rules of Professional Conduct and rewrote ethical standards for lawyers; today, the ABA offers a legal education award named for him. He was also instrumental in purchasing and preserving the Omaha Bank Building for use as the firm's main office. He died of a heart attack in 1983, at age 50.

They describe their style as \\"neo-Chinese chic\\", where the aesthetics of Chinese clothing and handicraft are combined with Western styles, using design features drawn from Chinese culture such as mandarin collars and Chinese patterns. In 2010 Forbes magazine ranked Wang as one of the 25 most influential Chinese in global fashion. Founding Wang Chen Tsai-Hsia was born in 1951 in Changhua, Taiwan. She was not formally educated in the industry, learning her trade by working at her uncle's factory. In 1978, she and her husband, Wang Yuan-hong (ÁéãÂÖÉÂÆè), a businessman in the textile trade, founded the Shiatzy International Company Limited in 1978. For over 30 years Wang worked to establish her name in the local market and build up an extensive client list. The company is one of the few homegrown designer labels in Taiwan with an international clientele including the former President of Taiwan Ma Ying-jeou, Taiwanese celebrities including Dee Shu, Patty Hou, Wang Leehom and Aska Yang; local politicians such as Jason Hu, businesswomen such as Pansy Ho and Shaw-Lan Wang; and British celebrities such as Elizabeth Hurley and Victoria Beckham. The Taiwan market is the company's major source of revenue. In Taiwan, Shiatzy Chen fashion shows, rather than showing upcoming collections, present the current season to their VIP clients, who purchase the clothes for their own use, rather than commercial buyers looking to buy upcoming styles. Merchandise While predominantly a womenswear company, in 1987 the company added a menswear line. While not bespoke menswear, the range includes off-the-peg changpaos intended for weddings and traditional engagement parties. A popular line is their quilted, often reversible, winter jackets, available in a wide range of styles, fabrics, patterns and color combinations.WWD-Shiatzy Chen Arrives on Bund In about 2007 they expanded their catalogue with accessories (sold in all stores) and a line of furniture available from their three flagship stores in Taipei, Shanghai and Paris. In June 2010, Shiatzy Chen and the tea culture brand Cha Cha Th√© (ÈááÈááÈ£üËå∂ÊñáÂåñ) opened an exclusive sales area in the super upscale Galeries Lafayette department store in Paris, along with a tea lounge in Taipei, where customers could come for tea, and purchase tea-wares and other gifts. Company history Shiatzy Chen store (Taipei, Taiwan) In 1990 Shiatzy Chen set up a studio in Paris to stay on top of fashion trends and to learn more about Western dressmaking techniques. This studio also serves as a training center for Taiwanese dressmakers and designers. They opened a flagship store in Paris in 2001. The label has been listed on the London-based Financial Times pick of what is hot in 2004. It was also deemed the most popular fashion brand in Taiwan by The Wall Street Journal Asia.https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=18&post;=24336 Sartorial elegance, oriental style In 2003 the company entered the Chinese market, opening a third flagship store in Shanghai, on The Bund in October 2005; with further stores in Hong Kong and Beijing. Restoration on the building began in late 2001. The interior was designed by Indonesian designer Jaya Ibrahim. The company aimed to have 50 stores in mainland China by 2010 in addition to their 48 outlets in Taiwan, 23 directly managed stores and 25 department store counters. In 2007 they opened a second factory, measuring 6000 square meters, in Shanghai alongside the existing one in Taipei. This new factory was designed by German architect Johannes Hartfuss to accommodate a workforce of more than 1,000 employees, including dressmakers and embroiderers, producing tens of thousands of clothing items annually based on over 400 styles created by its designers.Fashion label too sexy for Taiwan, eyes global market/Taiwan Review On 5 October 2008 Shiatzy Chen debuted at Paris Fashion Week, making Wang just the second Taiwanese design house (after YufengShawn, È¶≠È¢®È®∑, in 2005) to have officially shown there. They presented their show at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts on the Left Bank in central Paris, and have shown there in subsequent years, including an Anna Wintour inspired collection for Fall-Winter 2010-11.

The Mission/Spanish Revival buildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Construction and history The City of Azusa started work on its civic center in 1904 when the city's public library was moved to the area that is now the civic center. In 1928, the City completed construction of the two main wings of the civic center, with City Hall on one side and the municipal auditorium on the other. In 1929, a nine-foot by fifteen-foot miniature of the new Azusa Civic Center, made largely out of plaster-of-paris, was displayed as Azusa's exhibit at the Los Angeles County Fair. The Civic Center was completed in 1945 with the completion of the fire department's headquarters. At the time of the center's completion, the Los Angeles Times reported that the addition of the Fire Department to \\"Azusa's carefully designed Civic Center\\" added another section to the double-winged, one-story building that then housed the City Hall, Mayor's office, Chamber of Commerce, Public Library, Police Department, Water and Light Department, City Clerk, Treasurer, engineer and building inspector. All of the structures in the Civic Center were designed with a common Mission/Spanish Revival style of architecture. Since 1949, the Civic Center has been the location for musical events, a carnival, a parade, and other events associated with Azusa's annual \\"Golden Days\\" celebration conducted each fall. Celebration of a running gag: \\"Anaheim, Azusa and Cucamonga\\" A popular running gag on the long-running radio comedy The Jack Benny Program involved a train caller, voiced by Mel Blanc, calling out, \\"Train leaving on Track Five for Anaheim, Azusa and Cucamonga.\\" The gag, which also continued on Jack Benny's television program, brought national attention to the three cities. In 1966, a widely publicized ceremony was held at the Azusa Civic Center, celebrating \\"Jack Benny Day.\\" The celebration included a parade around Azusa's city hall with marching bands, drum majorettes and Benny seated on the tailgate of a small red wagon pulled by four Liliputian horses. Benny was given gold keys to the cities on Hawaiian leis presented by the queens of the three cities. Benny explained the origin of the gag as follows: > About 25 years ago on radio, we were looking for the names of three suburban > cities that would rhyme for a railroad scene featuring Mel Blanc. We didn't > look for sustaining gags, you can't create them artificially. We used it > once, twice, three times. Each time the audience laughed louder. We were not > about to give up a good thing. The gag was so popular that, when Benny died in 1974, the headline in the Los Angeles Times read: \\"Last Call for Anaheim, Azusa and Cucamonga ...\\" Historic designation The Azusa Civic Center was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 21, 2002.

A United States Army armored vehicle-launched bridge, returning to base in Uijeongbu on a public road after training maneuvers in the countryside, struck and killed two 14-year-old South Korean schoolgirls, Shin Hyo-sun (Korean: Ïã†Ìö®Ïàú) and Shim Mi-seon (Korean: Ïã¨ÎØ∏ÏÑ†). The American soldiers involved were found not guilty of negligent homicide in the court martial, further inflaming anti-American sentiment in South Korea and sparking a series of candlelight vigil protests in protest of their wrongful deaths. The memory of the two schoolgirls is commemorated annually in South Korea.South Korea Weekly Incident Yangju A U.S. military convoy from the 2nd Infantry Division of Eighth United States Army set out to undertake a training exercise at a range approximately 20 kilometers (12 mi) north of metropolitan Seoul.Don Kirk, \\"Road Accident Galvanizes the Country: Deaths in Korea Ignite Anti-American Passion,\\" International Herald Tribune, July 31, 2002. As the convoy passed along a narrow country road near Yangju City, Gyeonggi Province, one of the convoy's armored vehicles, weighing approximately 57 tons, struck and killed two 14-year-old South Korean schoolgirls, Shim Mi-son and Shin Hyo-sun, as they walked along the side of the roadway on their way to a birthday party.Howard W. French and Don Kirk, \\"American Policies and Presence Under Fire in South Korea,\\" New York Times, December 8, 2002 Legal proceedings On July 5, 2002, as a result of this incident, and in accordance with the U.S.-ROK Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), which stipulates that U.S. military personnel fall under the jurisdiction of U.S. military courts should they commit crimes while performing official duties, both the driver of the vehicle, Sergeant Mark Walker, and the vehicle‚Äôs commander, Sergeant Fernando Nino, were charged with \\"negligent homicide‚Äù under the U.S. military‚Äôs Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for \\"negligently failing to ensure the safe operation of the vehicle.\\"\\"US Soldiers Charged for Korean Deaths,\\" BBC News: World Edition, July 5, 2002 Seeking to prosecute the two soldiers in civilian courts under South Korean law, however, on July 10, the South Korean Justice Ministry requested that the USFK command transfer jurisdiction in the case to the South Korean legal system. While the SOFA stipulates that U.S. military personnel performing official duties fall under the jurisdiction of U.S. military courts, jurisdiction can be transferred to South Korea at the discretion of the U.S. military commander. Citing concerns about setting a precedent in terms of allowing civilian proceedings against U.S. military personnel, then Judge Advocate of the USFK, Colonel Kent Myers, said the U.S. command would not do so, noting that the U.S. Army had waived jurisdiction only once before in a case in which the act committed was intentional and not accidental. In a statement issued by the USFK, Myers noted that Walker and Nino were clearly performing assigned duties in an official capacity and were therefore subject to the UCMJ under the U.S.-ROK SOFA.\\"US Refuses Korean Justice for Soldiers,\\" BBC News: World Edition, August 7, 2002 Although they refused the request of the South Korean Justice Ministry, American officials did, however, invite more than 30 media representatives, representatives from the South Korean Justice Ministry, the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and from other South Korean non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to observe the trials. In addition, rooms with closed circuit television (CCTV) coverage were provided to accommodate the increased level of interest. Moreover, families of the victims were invited to attend and, to protect their privacy, were offered the use of a separate CCTV-equipped room staffed with an interpreter and military lawyer to explain the processes involved.\\"US Leaders Emphasize Openness,\\" News Release of the US Embassy Seoul, November 19, 2002. In addition to these actions, public statements made by U.S. officials stressed the fair and impartial nature of the U.S. military legal process. During the proceedings, lawyers for Nino contended that he attempted to alert Walker to the presence of the two girls on the periphery of the road. Reports differ as to whether Walker did not hear the order due to a defective communications device or because he had altered the frequency of his radio in order to communicate with others in the convoy. Nino and Walker were subsequently found not guilty of \\"negligent homicide\\" in verdicts issued independently by two separate panels on Wednesday, November 20 and Friday, November 22, 2002. While demonstrators questioned the legitimacy and objectivity of the U.S. military court and its verdict, the South Korean Justice Ministry voiced dissatisfaction with the verdict, but respect for the process as employed.\\"Korean Anger as US Soldiers Cleared,\\" BBC News: World Edition, November 22, 2002 Acquittal and expressions of anti-American sentiment Full apologies were issued by American civilian and military officials at various levels of authority immediately after the incident and repeated throughout the course of the legal proceedings. In addition, visits were made to the families of the two victims, and compensation was paid to the surviving family members. U.S. President George W. Bush also phoned then South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and expressed his regret over the deaths of the two South Korean schoolgirls. However, the acquittal of the two servicemen sparked anti-American demonstrations in various locations, termed \\"the biggest anti-American protests the country has seen in recent years\\" by a BBC report covering the December 2002 visit of then U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage to South Korea.\\"US Official Met by Korean Anger,\\" BBC News: World Edition, December 10, 2002 The same report also suggested that presidential elections in South Korea, set to take place that same December, may have focused attention on the issue as a larger referendum on the U.S.-ROK relationship, and thus exacerbated tensions. In addition to anger, sadness, and outrage at the death of the two girls, this move sparked protests in several locations as South Koreans expressed a desire for greater control over foreign military forces stationed in South Korea and urged that the SOFA be revised accordingly. Father Mun Jeong-hyeon, a Roman Catholic priest active in the anti-USFK movement, began a hunger strike outside the U.S. Embassy in Seoul. He was also a leader of the Pan National Committee, during the Daechuri protests. The Daechuri Protests were a 2005/6 protest against the expansion of Camp Humphreys, a U.S military base, in the small rural village of Daechuri. In addition to a series of large demonstrations at U.S. military installations and a rally attended by more than 50,000 people in Seoul during the second week of December, attacks, including fire bombings, were launched at the Yongsan Garrison and both the South Korean and American personnel responsible for guarding U.S. military installations in South Korea. In one incident in December 2002, an unarmed U.S. Army officer, Lieutenant Colonel Steven A. Boylan, was attacked by three South Korean men wielding a knife outside the Garrison. Boylan suffered only minor injuries.\\"US Soldier Attacked in South Korea\\". BBC News: World Edition. December 16, 2002 On 13 June 2017, multiple K-pop stars boycotted or left the performance midway during a US Military event for a camp stationed in Uijeongbu, citing protests by activists that the event fell on the 15th anniversary of the Yangju highway incident. Aftermath In the months following the incident, both the U.S. military and the South Korean government took actions to attempt to address the circumstances seen as having led to the deaths of the two schoolgirls. As of August 2002, the U.S. Army banned all armored vehicles of the type involved in the June 13th accident from civilian roads. In addition, the U.S. Army announced more than 20 additional measures to improve safety during training exercises, including improvements to the notification system used to communicate with community leaders about upcoming training exercises, the installation of additional mirrors on U.S. Army vehicles to improve driver visibility, and the retrofitting of additional intercom systems on U.S. military vehicles to allow for direct communication between drivers and vehicle commanders. Officials from Gyeonggi Province also took actions to address another issue seen to have contributed to the accident, inadequate transportation infrastructure. Reports indicated that one factor that may have contributed to the deaths of Shim Mi-son and Shin Hyo-sun, was the width and design of the roads in the area near their home village. Not only are roads in the area narrow, they do not always have space allocated along their periphery for pedestrians to use as walkways. Some have posited that this design contributes to the number of traffic accidents in South Korea in general. Given that the armored vehicles traveling in the convoy on June 13 are wider than both a typical passenger vehicle and than the lanes marked on most roads, and that the two girls were struck on the right-hand side of an uphill S-curve curving to the right, some reports posited that the design of the road where the accident occurred, and the width of the vehicles, the lanes on the road, and the road itself may have exacerbated the dangers already inherent when military vehicles operate within a civilian environment. As such, improvements were made to the road where the incident took place as part of a $94 million plan to improve more than of roads throughout the province. A major focal point of the project was the completion of improvements to roads used by the 2nd Infantry Division. Officials focused on widening, straightening, and smoothing the roads, while also adding footpaths. Begun in December 2002, reports suggest the project was 85 percent complete as of February 2004 and set to be concluded by April 2004. While the South Korean national government spent almost $1 million to acquire the land necessary to widen several stretches of road, in some cases by 2‚Äì3 feet, the cost of construction fell upon the Gyeonggi provincial government.Seth Robinson, \\"South Korea Widening Project to Help Prevent Repeat of 2002 Accident,\\" Stars And Stripes, February 8, 2004 See also *Anti-American sentiment in Korea *South Korea-United States relations *Demonstrations at Yongsan Garrison *Misun-Hyosun vigil *Death of Teo Peter *Death of Harry Dunn References External links *June 13th Accident - legal Q&A; at the U.S. Embassy Road incidents in South Korea Anti-Americanism 2002 in South Korea 2002 in international relations South Korea‚ÄìUnited States relations United States military in South Korea United States military scandals ","title":"Yangju highway incident"},{"id":"19127357","text":"Nana Iwasaka (Â≤©ÂùÇÂêçÂ•à Iwasaka Nana, born July 3, 1990) is a Japanese volleyball player who plays for Hisamitsu Springs.

Built as a connection from Sioux City, Iowa to the Union Pacific Railroad at Fremont, Nebraska, it became part of the Chicago and North Western Railway system in the 1880s, and is now a main line of the Union Pacific (UP). The east-west portion from Fremont to Missouri Valley, Iowa, is the Blair Subdivision, carrying mainly westbound UP trains (most eastbounds use the Omaha Subdivision), and the line from California Junction, Iowa north to Sioux City is the Sioux City Subdivision.Trains, Trackside Guide No. 4: Omaha- Council Bluffs, September 2003 History The Pacific Railway Act of 1862 defined a network of branches that would begin at the Missouri River and join the main line of the Union Pacific Railroad in or near Nebraska. The UP was required to build the branch from Sioux City, but an 1864 amendment released the UP from this obligation, allowing any railroad arriving at Sioux City from the east, or any newly incorporated railroad, to construct the line and gain the associated land grants. The Sioux City and Pacific Railroad was organized for this purpose in August 1864, and soon came under common ownership with the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad, a land-grant company, leased by the Chicago and North Western Railway, that completed its road across Iowa to Council Bluffs in April 1867. To build the portion in Nebraska, the Northern Nebraska Air Line Railroad was incorporated in June 1867 and merged into the Sioux City and Pacific in September 1868.Interstate Commerce Commission, 137 I.C.C. 1 (1928): Chicago and North Western Railway CompanyChicago and North Western Railway, Yesterday and To-day: A History, 1905, pp. 27-31 In August 1867 the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River opened a branch from Missouri Valley Junction west to California Junction (sold to the Sioux City and Pacific in July 1871), where the Sioux City and Pacific, funded by the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River, began constructing its line north through the Missouri River Valley, reaching Sioux City in February 1868. The line from California Junction west to Fremont, Nebraska was completed in early 1869, initially crossing the Missouri River via a car ferry. From 1870 until July 1884, the Sioux City and Pacific operated the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad, which continued northwest from Fremont into northwestern Nebraska. (The Illinois Central Railroad subsidiary Iowa Falls and Sioux City Railroad opened the first eastern connection to Sioux City in October 1870.Report of the Department of the Interior for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1885, Volume I, p. 630) The Blair Bridge opened in late 1883, replacing the car ferry across the Missouri River. In 1884, the Chicago and North Western acquired control of the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River and the connecting Chicago, Iowa and Nebraska Railroad, which had jointly purchased the Sioux City and Pacific in 1880. Operations remained separate until August 1901, when the C&NW; leased and soon merged the company into itself. (During the previous month, the Sioux City and Pacific had bought the incomplete roadbed of the Moville Extension Railway, which the C&NW; completed that year, branching off the main line at Sergeant Bluff and connecting to an existing C&NW; line at Moville.) The line became more important in the 1960s, when the point where the UP and C&NW; interchanged transcontinental traffic was moved from Council Bluffs to Fremont, allowing for a shorter route via Blair. After the UP acquired control of the C&NW; in 1995, it implemented directional running in late 1996, taking eastbound trains (including Powder River Basin coal) over the longer but flatter Omaha Subdivision through Council Bluffs. However, high-priority \\"Z\\" intermodal trains use the Blair Subdivision in both directions. See also * Sioux City & Pacific R.R. Co. v.

One of the first cloud platforms, Heroku has been in development since June 2007, when it supported only the Ruby programming language, but now supports Java, Node.js, Scala, Clojure, Python, PHP, and Go. For this reason, Heroku is said to be a polyglot platform as it has features for a developer to build, run and scale applications in a similar manner across most languages. Heroku was acquired by Salesforce.com in 2010 for $212 million.Salesforce.com Buys Heroku For $212 Million In Cash https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/08/breaking-salesforce-buys-heroku- for-212-million-in-cash/  History  Heroku was initially developed by James Lindenbaum, Adam Wiggins, and Orion Henryhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/orion- henry-9056727 for supporting projects that were compatible with the Ruby programming platform known as Rack. The prototype development took around six months. Later on, Heroku faced drawbacks because of lack of proper market customers as many app developers used their own tools and environment. In January 2009, a new platform was launched which was built almost from scratch after a three-month effort. In October 2009, Byron Sebastian joined Heroku as CEO. On December 8, 2010, Salesforce.com acquired Heroku as a wholly owned subsidiary of Salesforce.com. On July 12, 2011, Yukihiro \\"Matz\\" Matsumoto, the chief designer of the Ruby programming language, joined the company as Chief Architect, Ruby. That same month, Heroku added support for Node.js and Clojure. On September 15, 2011, Heroku and Facebook introduced Heroku for Facebook. At present Heroku supports Redis databases in addition to its standard PostgreSQL.  Etymology  The name \\"Heroku\\" is a portmanteau of \\"heroic\\" and \\"haiku\\". The Japanese theme is a nod to Matz for creating Ruby. The name itself is pronounced similarly to ‚Äúwidely‚Äù (\\"hiroku\\") in Japanese, though the creators of Heroku did not want the name of their project to have a particular meaning, in Japanese or any other language, and so chose to invent a name.  Architecture  A diagrammatic view of the working of Heroku Platform Applications that are run on Heroku typically have a unique domain used to route HTTP requests to the correct application container or dyno. Each of the dynos are spread across a \\"dyno grid\\" which consists of several servers. Heroku's Git server handles application repository pushes from permitted users. All Heroku services are hosted on Amazon's EC2 cloud- computing platform.  Products  ; The Heroku Platform : The Heroku network runs the customer's apps in virtual containers which execute on a reliable runtime environment. Heroku calls these containers \\"Dynos.\\" These Dynos can run code written in Node, Ruby, PHP, Go, Scala, Python, Java, or Clojure. Heroku also provides custom buildpacks with which the developer can deploy apps in any other language. Heroku lets the developer scale the app instantly just by either increasing the number of dynos or by changing the type of dyno the app runs in. ; Heroku Postgres : Heroku Postgres is the Cloud database (DBaaS) service for Heroku based on PostgreSQL. Heroku Postgres provides features like continuous protection, rollback, and high availability; also forks, followers, and dataclips. ; Heroku Redis : Heroku Redis is the customized Redis from Heroku to provide a better developer experience. It is fully managed and is provided as a service by Heroku. It helps in managing instances with a CLI, associate data with Postgres to gain business insights using SQL tools, and lets customer gain performance visibility. ; Heroku Teams : Heroku Teams is a team management tool which provides collaboration and controls to bring a customer's developers, processes, and tools together in order to build better software. With Heroku Teams, teams can self-organize, add, and manage members, get fine-grained control with app-level permissions and also use collaboration tools like Heroku Pipelines. It also provides delegated administration and centralized billing. ; Heroku Enterprise : Heroku Enterprise provides services to large companies which help them to improve collaboration among different teams. It provides a set of features like fine- grained access controls, identity federation, and private spaces to manage their enterprise application development process, resources, and users. ; Heroku Connect : Heroku Connect lets users create Heroku apps that can easily integrate with Salesforce deployments at scale.

Career  Born in 1974 in Lahti, Finland, Antti Sakari Saario graduated in Mathematics and Electronic music at Keele University in 1997. He continued his studies in composition under Jonty Harrison at the University of Birmingham - working with Birmingham ElectroAcoustic Sound Theatre ( BEAST ) - receiving his PhD from Birmingham University in 2002 (PhD, University of Birmingham, School of Humanities, Department of Music, 2002).http://findit.bham.ac.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?vid=44BIR_VU1&docId;=44BIR_ALEPH_DS002199775&fn;=permalink His numerous postgraduate compositions have been performed in a variety of venues and through a wide range of mediums - Most notably B-Side (1998) ‚Äî A Fixed media composition. This was Released on Spike Works from BEAST ‚Äî vol. 1. London: Sargasso Records. It was further featured in the Canadian Electroacoustic Community‚Äôs release Presence II . B-Side (1998) was positively reviewed by Rajmil Fischman in Sonic Arts Network's publication Diffusion, reprinted in eContact! After a period of experimental work in Norway, Antti Sakari Saario undertook his current teaching post at Falmouth University. His second wave of non-commercial compositional output began to emerge in the 2006 and has continued to date. Notable compositions have included : Making Space: When The Curtain Falls (2007) - an acousmatic play for multichannel playback system and blacked-out space, performed as part of Nuffield Theatre's Making Space 2007 bursary/mini-residency scheme. This work was featured at ACMC 2008, Sydney Conservatorium of Music - The University of Sydney, Australia in July 2008. Flocking: an improvatorio (2007-) for voices, string quartet and live- electronics. A free improvisation led by Steve Lewis in collaboration with David Prior. This was a site specific performance at Ashton Memorial as part of Lancaster Jazz Festival. . It subsequently featured at View Two Gallery, Liverpool, UK on Sept 6th, 2007. . A DVD of the Jazz Festival performance was produced with a 5.1 surround audio recording by David Prior, Saario and video artist Jenny McCabe.  Influences  Dr Saario's work reflect his evolution as a composer - he readily acknowledges the influence of his tutors and collaborators on his work. Jonty Harrison, David Prior, Iain Armstrong and Robert Penman have left a telling influence on his sonic production. One characteristic feature of Dr Saarios work is his willingness to counterbalance within his work a wide range of aesthetic and academic approaches. The literary output of William S. Burroughs has been evident since his earliest compositions. The philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari and the filmwork of David Lynch and the Dogma 95 collaboration in particular underpin his composition as well as his academic approach. Since 2001 majority of his output has been collaborative, and in many instances interdisciplinary (e.g. 'The Hollywoods' and 'Aboriginal Terraformations' with visual artist Amanda Newall, and the [zygote] concept with composer and musicologist Martin Iddon). His personal interests in martial arts can be clearly evidenced in his recent work - Making Space: When The Curtain Falls (2007) ..

Part of the book details his involvement with an Asian match-fixing gang as they travelled around the world to fix major football matches. Hill has also published a number of academic articles, is a reviewer for Global Integrity and has probed the impact of the Russian mafia on professional ice hockey. In 2011, he pioneered the first on-line anti-match-fixing education course for Sport Accord that was eventually used by Interpol.

Public dispute In September 2013, following the arrest of match-fixers in Singapore, Hill was interviewed on BBC Radio World Service where he claimed the Singapore Police Force to have offered protection to the accused from prosecution. This was strongly disputed by the Singapore government as baseless and challenged him to come forth with any evidence to substantiate his claims. In response to Hill's claims, Ronald Noble, Secretary General of Interpol said that \\"Those who do not recognise the commitment and resources that Singapore has devoted to identifying those believed to be responsible for match-fixing cases, or those who seek publicity -- simply to criticise every positive development that occurs in fighting match-fixing should simply open their eyes and look at the facts.\\" Hill responded to these accusations by saying that if they had not been providing tacit protection for the nest of home-grown fixers in their midst, then the Singaporean police must be one of the most inept law- enforcement agencies in the world. For over two years, they had ignored two international arrest warrants - strangely both were from Ron Noble's Interpol (who subsequently opened a regional headquarters in Singapore) and the well- publicized criminal trial of a Singaporean match-fixer in Finland.

Hard-tail bridged guitars use different bridges from those guitars fitted with vibrato systems (which are also known as tremolo arms or whammy bars).  Construction and materials  The stoptail bridge consists of two parts: an adjustable fixed bridge piece, such as a Tune-o-matic and a separate stopbar (or stop bar) tailpiece. A stopbar tailpiece is, as the name implies, a bar-shaped formed metal piece commonly made of pot metal or zinc alloys although aluminum and brass may be used. Many manufacturers claim that the use of lightweight metals and alloys, such as aluminum, provide a greater transfer of the string's vibrational energy or \\"resonant quality\\" to the guitar body since there is less mass to excite. Aluminum was also used in the early examples of stoptail bridges from the 1950s, so it carries the mantle of \\"vintage\\" vibe. The \\"stop\\" part comes from the fact that the string ends are held in place or they \\"stop\\" inside the bar. The bar is mounted on top of the guitar body usually by means of sturdy threaded metal studs screwed into threaded sleeves embedded into the body of the guitar. The studs and stopbar are located behind the separate bridge piece. The stopbar can either simply slip onto notches on top of the studs, or be held in place using set screws. One danger to be aware of is that the stopbar can fall out of the notches when changing strings and put a ding in the guitar's finish. When it is held in place using the screws, it is sometimes referred to as a \\"locking stopbar\\". In these designs, the Tune-o-matic bridge section is also usually fastened to its embedded studs by set screws. This fastening of the key components in a stoptail bridge system is claimed to impart more sustain and tone to the guitar's sound.  Function and advantages  The stopbar has holes drilled into it that allow the guitar strings to be threaded from the rear and out through the front. The string path then goes over the bridge saddles and the string nut to the machine heads located on the headstock. The stopbar tailpiece is meant to be adjusted for string tension. The threaded posts can be lowered or raised to increase or relieve the string tension at pitch. This is an important adjustment especially when changing the gauge of the string set on the guitar. There are practical limits to this technique: too high and you could bend the posts and the strings won't seat properly into the bridge saddles; too low and the string break will rest on the rear of the bridge, killing sustain and tone. Some players prefer to tighten the stopbar all the way down in an attempt to increase sustain and tone. This requires a different stringing technique. Some players, like Duane Allman, deviate from the norm and \\"top wrap\\" their strings. This is when the direction of the string path is reversed so that the strings are threaded through the leading edge of the stopbar then come out the rear and wrapped over the top of the stop bar. The advantage is that strings are supposedly easier to bend because of the decreased string break angle. Also, the \\"nonspeaking\\" string length is increased, which may have an effect on the strings' harmonic vibration (see sympathetic resonance). The increased tendency for the strings to produce natural harmonics may make techniques such as pinch harmonics easier to accomplish. This is the same way that a wraparound stoptail bridge is strung. Regardless of the technique used, the tension provided by tightening the strings to pitch is the only thing keeping the stopbar in place, unless it is a \\"locking\\" type. The supposed advantages of using a stoptail bridge over a tremolo bridge are: greater ability to keep the strings in tune, especially under the duress of hard note-bending; better string path stability and ability to intonate; and, better sustain due to a more direct resonance of the guitar's tonewood excited by the transmission of sound wave energy from the vibrating string. This is not a universally accepted opinion and guitarists will argue over the virtues of stoptail, hard- tail and tremolo bridges probably for as long as they all exist.  Variations  Gibson Guitar Corporation guitars tend to be most often associated with the stoptail bridge, especially the iconic Gibson Les Paul model, whereas Fender Musical Instruments Corporation guitars are most often thought of as vibrato bridges like the famous Stratocaster model. Wraparound guitar bridge (compensated) on a PRS SE Custom guitar  Wraparound  A variant of a stoptail bridge is the \\"wraparound.\\" Wraparound style bridges are used on less costly models such as the Gibson Melody Maker and on expensive, high-end guitars like PRS Guitars. This style bridge combines the bridge and stopbar into one unit. There are a variety of wraparound bridge designs. They may have individual movable bridge saddles (adjustable stoptail bridges), a fixed compensated saddle similar to an acoustic guitar bridge, or simply a straight stopbar anchored in the bridge position.

Deleted data is zeroed out immediately.http://docs.rackspace.com/files/api/v1/cf- devguide/content/Delete_Object-d1e2264.html ; Use cases Use cases considered as \\"well suited\\" include backing up or archiving data, serving images and videos (which are streamed directly to the users' browsers), serving content over content delivery networks, storing secondary static web-accessible data, developing data storage applications, storing fluctuating and/or unpredictable amounts of data and reducing costs. ; Caveats There is no native operating system support for the Cloud Files API so it is not yet possible to \\"map\\" or \\"mount\\" it as a virtual drive without third-party software like JungleDisk that translates to a supported standard such as WebDAV. There are no concepts of \\"appending\\" or \\"locking\\" data within Cloud Files (which may affect some disk mirroring or backup solutions), nor support for permissions or transcoding. Data is organised into \\"containers\\" but it is not possible to create nested folders without a translation layer.http://docs.rackspace.com/files/api/v1/cf- devguide/content/Containers-d1e458.html  Cloud Servers  Cloud Servers is a cloud infrastructure service that allows users to deploy \\"one to hundreds of cloud servers instantly\\" and create \\"advanced, high availability architectures\\" similar to the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. The \\"cloud servers\\" are virtual machines running on the Xen hypervisor for Linux-based instances, and Citrix XenServer for Windows and Linux instances. Each quad core hardware node has between 16 and 32 GB of RAM, allowing for allocations between 256 MB and 30 GB. Disk and CPU allocations scale up with memory, with disk sizes ranging from 10 GB to 620 GB.Rackspace Cloud: Cloud Servers Technical Specifications Various distributions of Linux are supported, including Arch, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Ubuntu. The technology behind the service was purchased in Rackspace's October 22, 2008 acquisition of Slicehost and the servers were formerly known as \\"slices\\". These are \\"much cheaper and generally easier to use than a traditional dedicated server\\", though it is still necessary to maintain the operating system and solution stack which is not required for the Cloud Sites product.Rackspace Acquires JungleDisk, Slicehost To Take On Amazon Web Services This is one of the main differentiators between the two services; where Cloud Servers includes full root access and thus allows for more customisation, the Cloud Sites product is less flexible but requires less maintenance. On December 14, 2010, Rackspace began offering a managed service level on the Cloud Servers product, which added additional support for the operating system and common applications as well as patching and other routine services. This additional support level does come at an increased cost, however. During 2014, Rackspace ceased to advertise the First Generation Cloud Servers and the Standard Next Generation Cloud Servers on its main Cloud Servers product page, opting to only disclose the Next Generation Performance 1 and Performance 2 products that require a minimum $50/month service charge per account for support service. The First Generation and Standard Next Generation platforms are now referred to as \\"Legacy Infrastructure\\" buried in the pricing page for the old products. The minimum charge for the lowest product on the First Generation platform is $10.95/month for the 256MB instance while the minimum charge on the Standard Next Generation platform is $16.06/month for the 512MB instance. On the Performance platform, the minimum charge for one server is $23.36 for the 1GB instance + $50 minimum service charge, for a total of $73.36/month.Rackspace Cloud Pricing Calculator Rackspace is quietly phasing out its older, less expensive products in transition to a managed platform where mandatory support charges are incorporated into the cost of the services. Cloud Tools are applications and infrastructure software built to run on the RackSpace cloud. Applications listed include Zend, a PHP stack, Cloudkick, a cloud performance testing services, CopperEgg, a real-time cloud server and application monitoring service, Xeround, a MySQL cloud database, and MongoLab, the cloud version of the popular NoSQL database MongoDB. ; API The Cloud Servers API launched on July 14, 2009 under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license allows clients to create, configure and control virtual servers.The Rackspace Cloud Goes Open Source with APIs In addition to issuing basic management commands this \\"enables elastic scenarios\\" whereby servers are instantiated and destroyed in response to fluctuating load (one of the key characteristics of cloud computing).Rackspace API gives developers greater access to cloud platform RightScale is among third-party providers to have announced support for this API.Cloud Expo: RightScale adds RackSpace, Eucalyptus to its 'hybrid clouds'  Former Services   Cloud Sites  Cloud Sites is a platform as a service offering now owned by Liquid Web, similar to traditional web hosting only built on horizontally scalable hardware infrastructure. A fixed monthly credit card payment gives users access to the service with an allocation of compute, storage and bandwidth resources. Should this allocation be exhausted then subsequent usage is billed on a utility computing basis. It allows an \\"unlimited\\" number of sites, databases and email accounts and includes reseller options such as client billing and support. Touted as \\"the fastest way to put sites on the cloud\\", it runs Windows or Linux applications across \\"hundreds of servers\\". Cloud Sites supports the PHP 5, Perl, Python, MySQL, .NET 2.0+, ASP and Microsoft SQL Server 2014 application frameworks. In 2016, the Cloud Sites division was sold to Liquid Web LLC. ; Compute cycles The service includes up to 10,000 \\"compute cycles\\" per month which \\"is roughly equivalent to running a server with a 2.8 GHz modern processor for the same period of time\\" (with additional cycles priced at USD 0.01). This non-standard unit of measurement primarily reflects CPU processing time but also includes I/O operations so pages with many database queries will consume more \\"compute cycles\\".Rackspace Cloud Hosting FAQ It can however be difficult to compare services between providers without standard units of measurement. ; Caveats Cloud Sites does not support Java, Tomcat, ColdFusion, SSH, RDP, API access, Microsoft Exchange or custom server-side components at this time. It is also not possible to set up multiple top level domains to point to the same web root directory.Hosting High Traffic Web Sites with Mosso The .NET environment dropped support for \\"full trust\\" in favour of \\"modified medium trust\\" despite having previously announced on their blog that they had been able to work directly with Microsoft to engineer a system that could accommodate Full Trust without compromising the security, scalability, and performance of other users.  Locations  Cloud servers and most other cloud products are physically located in any of six data centers:The Rackspace Cloud Has Arrived In Hong Kong Chicago, Northern Virginia, Dallas, London, Sydney, or Hong Kong. A separate \\"UK\\" account is required to access the London-based cloud products, however a single \\"US\\" Rackspace cloud account can access all US data centers along with the Sydney and Hong Kong regions. Cloud Sites are available in the Dallas and Chicago data centers only.  Control Panel  Rackspace Cloud online control panel The online control panel was custom built by and for the Rackspace Cloud service (as opposed to using control panel software like cPanel).Mosso‚Äôs New Control Panel and Provisioning System The control panel includes management interfaces for the Cloud Sites, Cloud Servers and Cloud Files services. There was once a web based file manager, but this was removed for undisclosed reasons. It also allows users to manage multiple clients and the plans and products (e.g. databases, 24x7 support) that apply to them, with white label branding options for messaging. The clients themselves have access to a restricted version of the control panel that allows them to conduct administrative tasks such as managing mail accounts.Rackspace Cloud Control Panel The control panel is also home to the billing and reporting functions and provides access to support materials including developer resources, a knowledge base, forums and live chat.  OpenStack  In 2010, RackSpace contributed the source code of its Cloud Files product to the OpenStack project under the Apache License to become the OpenStack Object Storage component.http://www.rackspace.com/blog/?p=1047 In April 2012, Rackspace announced it would implement OpenStack Compute as the underlying technology for their Cloud Servers product. The change will come a new control panel as well as add-on cloud services offering databases, server monitoring, block storage, and virtual networking.

The test was developed by the French chemist Auguste Nicolas Eugene Millon (1812-1867). thumbnail The reagent is made by dissolving metallic mercury in nitrous acid and diluting with water. In the test, the phenol group in the side chain of tyrosine gets nitrated, and that product then complexes with Hg(I) or Hg(II) ions to give red coloration or precipitate. Millon's test is not specific for proteins; it also gives a positive test for other compounds containing the phenol functional group.

Francesco Turatello (Asiago, 1944 ‚Äì Nuoro, August 17, 1981) was an important Italian crime figure, and mob boss who operated during the 1970s mainly in the city of Milan. He was popularly known by his pseudonym Francis Turatello. His nickname was \\"Faccia d'Angelo\\" (Angel Face).Pfister, The Fatal Gift of Beauty, pp. 396 Biography Early career Born in Veneto, Turatello was the son of a maiden seamstress from Asiago in the Province of Vicenza who returned to her hometown during World War II. According to some sources, he is the biological son of Italian-American Frank Coppola, the powerful Gambino family figure, also known as \\"Frankie Three Fingers\\". In any case, he was Coppola's godson. Turatello moved with his mother to Milan in his early childhood and settled in the district of Lambrate. He became an amateur boxer in his youth and later made his first appearance in the local Milanese underworld as a petty car thief. Driven by a strong personality and a firm ambition to succeed, he rose up in position and increasingly began taking serious roles, eventually becoming the head of a criminal gang consisting mainly of immigrants from Catania, Sicily. Mob boss His gang sought to control all the clandestine criminal rackets within the city as well as being the sole controller of prostitution. The gang made billions of lire from these rackets, and also participated in several robberies and kidnappings, with the complicity of the Banda dei Marsigliesi, headed by Albert Bergamelli. Turatello was the boss of all illegal rackets in the Po valley as far north as Milan and was a close prot√©g√© of the Mafia. Allies and Rivals Turatello became infamous for his strong rivalry against Renato Vallanzasca which generated a bloody feud with numerous victims on both sides. After both Turatello and Vallanzasca were arrested for their part in the gang war, they reconciled their differences and became close friends. Turatello was the witness to the marriage of Vallanzasca to Giuliana Brusa which was celebrated in prison. Turatello had close allies and powerful contacts within the Sicilian Mafia, and throughout his criminal career was always in contact with Sicilian Mafiosi and Neapolitan Camorristi. He was a close ally of the Nuova Camorra Organizzata (NCO), headed by Raffaele Cutolo. He was also a trusted friend of Luciano Leggio, the head of the Corleonesi faction of the Sicilian Mafia. Leggio put Turatello in charge of all drug trade in the region of Milan. Turatello has also been linked to many murky incidents of the history of Italy in the 1970s, including the abduction and murder of former Italian prime minister, Aldo Moro, and some criminal acts carried out by the Banda della Magliana of Rome. Arrest After absconding for a long time, Francis Turatello was arrested on August 17, 1981 in Piazza Cordusio in Milan. He was tried for a long list of crimes and was sentenced to a long period of detention coupled with a harsh prison time. He was successful in controlling his gang and coordinating his business activities in prison, but his position within the organization was usurped and overtaken by his former right-hand man, Angelo Epaminonda. Assassination On August 17, 1981, during the open yard exercise in the courtyard of Badu 'e Carros, the high security prison in Nuoro, Sardinia, Turatello was ambushed by the NCO hitman Pasquale Barra, Vincenzo Andraous and the well known assassins from Catania Salvatore Maltese and Antonino Faro. Turatello was unable to escape the ambush. Barra and Andraus held Turatello, while Faro and Maltese stabbed him sixty times. In the ensuing confusion from the attack, Andraous was also wounded and would later receive minor surgery in the prison infirmary.Jacquemet, Credibility in Court, pp. 70 The reason for such a terrible killing, indicative of a heavy guilt inside the mob environment, is still unknown now. The murder was probably ordered by Raffaele Cutolo and the death sentence was passed by Carmela Provenzano, the wife of senior NCO figure Pasquale D'Amico, but there are no evidences of that. The murder of Turatello was done without the consent of the Sicilian Mafia, and as Turatello was a close friend of Luciano Leggio and Frank Coppola, it was an insult to their honor. As a result, the murder brought severe repercussions on the main hitman, Pasquale Barra, and would lead to his defection from the NCO and becoming a pentito. After Turatello's death, his successor Angelo Epaminonda also became a pentito.Enzo Tortora: Justice betrayed , Panorama, August 27, 1986 References *Jacquemet, Marco (1996).

It is also cited as the Renhe-Huili earthquake, especially in SCEA reports and early CEA reports. It was not an aftershock of the Sichuan earthquake that occurred several months prior. With more than 400 aftershocks, it caused over 40 deaths, the collapse of 10,000 homes and damage to other infrastructure in the area. The maximum intensity was VIII liedu (Heavily damaging). Earthquake According to the China Earthquake Administration (CEA) and Sichuan Earthquake Administration (SCEA), the () 6.1 shock struck southern Sichuan province, China on August 30, 2008 at 16:30:50.5 China Standard Time (CST - 0730 UTC). The United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported it at () 5.7. The earthquake's epicenter was located at ,This is given by CEA. USGS reports latitude as 26.0. in the Renhe District of Panzhihua, Sichuan, which is 50 km southeast of the city center. The epicenter is 60 km from Huili County in Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan, 30 km from Yongren County and 55 km from Yuanmou County in neighboring Yunnan province. Whereas the Sichuan earthquake two and half months earlier in the same province continues to invoke aftershocks even after August 30, the Panzhihua earthquake was not one of them because it occurred on a different fault. Damage By September 5, authorities confirmed 41 deaths (35 in Sichuan, 6 in Yunnan) and 589 injuries. CEA also reported collapse of 10,000 homes, and damage to 190,000 more. Considerable damage to highways, bridges, and reservoirs were reported. Intensity The seismic intensity map published by SCEA shows a maximum intensity of liedu VIII on China Seismic Intensity Scale (CSIS), somewhat equivalent to VIII (Heavily damaging) on EMS-94 from which CSIS drew reference. The area affected by liedu VIII earthquakes covered a north-south oriented oval of 628 km2 centered around the epicenter, 39 km long and 19 km wide, including 28 km2 in Yunnan province. The total area of liedu VI (Slightly damaging) and above is 9,634 km2, of which 6,265 km2 are in Sichuan. Aftershocks A 5.6 aftershock (5.5 according to USGS) struck the same location on August 31, 2008 at 16:31:09.6 CST (08:31 UTC), causing at least two additional deaths. By midnight CST September 1, there had been 439 aftershocks including the M5.6 one and two more exceeding M4.0. Incidentally, a 3.0 earthquake very close to the main quake's epicenter preceded the main quake by 2 hours 15 minutes. Reported epicenter was Lat.26.3, Long.101.9. Response Although the quake-stricken area is relatively low in population, reported at 118/km2, early casualties and property damage were significant. Within two hours, the CEA invoked its Level III emergency response protocol for disaster relief. 8,000 troops and para-militia were deployed to the disaster area.

Green and starring by Barbara Stanwyck, Frank Morgan, and Ricardo Cortez. Based on the novel A Lost Lady by Willa Cather, with a screenplay by Gene Markey and Kathryn Scola, the film is about a woman whose fianc√© is murdered by his mistress' husband two days before their wedding. Her uncle sends her away to the mountains, where she meets a man who looks after her and eventually proposes. She accepts even though she does not love him. Warner Brothers had filmed this story before in 1924 as a silent with Irene Rich. Plot Marian and Ned are getting married in two days. Ned is accused by a man of having an affair with his wife and killed in front of her. Marian goes to a resort she loves of in the Canadian Rockies in hopes it will snap her out of her emotional withdrawal. One day while walking alone, she falls off a ledge and injures her leg. She is discovered and rescued by Dan Forrester, and his dog Sandy. Dan visits Marian every day, even though she is still upset about her fianc√©'s death. Before he goes home, Dan asks her to marry him. She refuses at first, telling him she does not love him, but he is undeterred. At the last moment, she changes her mind and accepts his proposal. After the wedding, however, they sleep in separate bedrooms. The couple go to Chicago, where he heads a successful law firm. He dotes on Marian, even building her a mansion in the country. He coaxes her out of her depression, and everything is going well enough, until one day Frank Ellinger has to make an emergency landing on her estate after his airplane runs out of fuel. Mistaking her for a servant, he grabs her and kisses her. She slaps him in the face and leaves, but long- dead emotions are stirred within her. They are both surprised when they meet socially. He turns out to run a transport company. She rejects his advances, but he persists. When Dan goes to New York for three weeks on business, Frank sees her every day, and Marian soon falls in love again. When Dan returns, Marian tells him the news. He is devastated. He stays up all night trying to come to grips with this development, even though he has a major corporate case going to trial the next day. At the trial, he collapses and has a heart attack. Marian, who had already packed her clothes to go to Frank, refuses to leave Dan's side, despite Frank's urging. The tables are turned: now she is the one trying to cheer Dan up. She then realizes she has finally come to love her husband, and tells him so.

He was designated as the Crown Prince (ÁöáÂ§™Â≠ê) of the Yuan dynasty by Kublai Khan in 1273, and became the head of the Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng). The North Chinese Buddhist monk Haiyun gave him the name Zhenjin (\\"True Gold\\") when he was born in 1243. He was also known as a strong supporter of Confucianism. When a Confucian-trained official in the South proposed that Kublai abdicate in favor of Zhenjin in 1285, Kublai was angered. Zhenjin died on 5 January 1286, eight years before his father Kublai Khan. According to the History of Yuan, he died of alcoholism. However, it may not have been as simple as merely drinking too much. It also stated that shortly before his death, some ministers of the court wanted to propose that Kublai Khan abdicate his throne to Prince Zhenjin on account of old age and because Zhenjin was highly respected throughout the empire. However, Zhenjin tried to prevent this from happening. Unfortunately, Kublai Khan found out anyway and was furious, which terrified Zhenjin and may have led him to overdrink.

Its strength can often be varied by usage of electromagnets. Magnetic lenses are used in diverse applications, from cathode ray tubes over electron microscopy to particle accelerators.  Design  A magnetic lens typically consists of several electromagnets arranged in a quadrupole (see quadrupole magnet), sextupole, or higher format; the electromagnetic coils are placed at the vertices of a square or another regular polygon. From this configuration a customized magnetic field can be formed to manipulate the particle beam. The passing particle is subjected to two vector forces H_Z (parallel to the core), and H_R (parallel to the radius of the lens). H_R causes the particle to spiral through the lens, and this spiraling expose the electron to H_Z which in turn focus the electron. Note that the magnetic field is inhomogeneous, particles close to the center are less strongly deflected than those passing the lens far from the axis.Hafner B., 2008, Introductory Transmission Electron Microscopy Primer, Characterization Facility, University of Minnesota - \\"Reference\\"  Uses  A deflection yoke (copper coils and white plastic former) around the rear neck of a cathode ray tube television View inside the yoke, with the tube removed Television sets employing cathode ray tubes use a magnetic lens in the form of a deflection yoke to enable an electron beam to scan the image by deflecting it vertically and horizontally.

Biography Maurice Gerard Frawley was born on 5 May 1954, the son of Gerard Patrick and Eileen Marie Frawley, he grew up with three siblings, Brendan, Mary and Leo, on the family farm near Elmore, Victoria. He attended Our Lady of the Sacred Heart School (a Catholic primary school) in Elmore, Rochester Lourdes High School in nearby Rochester and then Salesian College in Sunbury (an outer suburb of Melbourne), where he completed an agricultural studies course. After working in wool sheds in rural Victoria, he moved to Melbourne in the late 1970s to pursue a musical career. Frawley formed power pop band Japanese Comix in 1979, with vocalist Shane Day (ex-Cruisers, High Rise Bombers), bass guitarist Chris Jobson, drummer Greg Simpkins and James Williams (High Rise Bombers). They played the Melbourne pub circuit and released a four-track extended play, Japanese Comix on the Mambo Records label in 1980. Simpkins was replaced by Michael Barclay but the group soon disbanded. As a melodic guitarist, Frawley developed a reputation as a down-to-earth, \\"musician's musician\\". Late in 1980 he had a brief stint in A Howling Life with Day, Williams and Bill Tulloch. In late 1981, Frawley replaced Mick Holmes on guitar in Paul Kelly and the Dots (Kelly was ex-High Rise Bombers) after that band had recorded their second album Manila. The album's release was delayed until August 1982 due to line-up changes and Kelly being side-lined with a broken jaw. While working with Kelly, Frawley co-wrote \\"Look So Fine, Feel So Low\\". The band recorded \\"Rocking Institution\\" for the soundtrack of pop musical film, Starstruck. It was released as a shared single with Jo Kennedy's \\"Body and Soul\\", which peaked at No. 5 in May 1982 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart. The Dots disbanded by August 1983 and Frawley briefly joined the Paul Kelly Band but left before year's end. Kelly relocated to Sydney in late 1984 and \\"Look So Fine, Feel So Low\\" appeared on his solo album Post (1985), it was re- recorded by Paul Kelly & the Messengers for Gossip (1986) and released as a single in July 1987, which did not reach the Top 50. Frawley joined Olympic Sideburns late in 1983, an ever-evolving shockabilly outfit that had featured Spencer P. Jones (later in The Johnnys, The Beasts of Bourbon) which formed in 1982. Rooted in classic 1960s garage rock, their 'Oz-indie' racket made them distinct from most groups in the suburban beer barns. The Olympic Sideburns was a collection of 1980s alternative artists. The band released two albums, The Olympic Sideburns in May 1985 and Dixie Truck Stop! in 1987. They disbanded by end of 1988. In 1989 he produced an EP for The Romeos. In 1990, Frawley formed Big City Burnout with Jack Abeyratne on guitar, Nigel Hartford on bass guitar (ex-White Cross), David Sandford on saxophone, piano and vocals, and Paul Wall on drums. By 1993 he formed Maurice Frawley and Working Class Ringos, a rootsy country-blues band. The line-up was drummer Des Hefner (The Birthday Party, The Slaughtermen), guitarist Charlie Owen (The New Christs, The Divinyls), and bass player Shane Walsh. Cold Chisel's Don Walker described the group as \\"the best after-midnight band in the world\\". Owen called them \\"the bad boys of folk\\" who played \\"the most passionate, beautiful, rollicking, cheeky, heartfelt music you could ever hear\\". Working Class Ringos released an extended play, Whoop Whoop, a raw, acoustic recording of soul and blues, in 1994. It was followed by their debut album Livin' Lazy (May 1995), a more electric album which featured Jones and was produced by Tony Cohen. In 1998 Conway Savage (Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds) joined on piano. Their second album Triple-Skin Marquee was released in 2000, again produced by Cohen. It features a duet, \\"Would You Be My Friend\\", between Frawley and Kelly. For thirteen years the band played the Melbourne pub circuit, establishing a base at The Esplanade Hotel in St Kilda. In 2000 the band's track \\"Harness Down\\" was included on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Airplay Vol. 3 compilation, which was featured on local radio. \\"Harness Down\\" became a favourite of its audience. The band made several tours through the east coast up to Far North Queensland. Frawley and his band performed live sessions in 2000 on the ABC TV's national music program 'Studio 22' and in 2001 on the cable channel Country Music Television. Frawley became a regular at the Tamworth Country Music Festival. In 2003, Frawley embarked on a family musical project, Frawleys and Friends, that culminated in the release Queen of Runnymede featuring the songs of a relative, Sarah Frawley, who had died (aged 19) from a brain aneurysm. In 2006, Frawley reunited with former band mates Michael Barclay on drums and Alan Brooker on bass guitar, together with Garrett Costigan on pedal steel and Jimmy Williams on guitar to form Maurice Frawley and the Yard Hands. Their debut album Good Things was released on Frawley's own Red Finn Records. Frawley returned to rural Rochester to care for his ill mother, Eileen. His brother Leo recalled, \\"Maurice was a great support to mum during her last few years and mum's passing last year left a hole in Maurice's life\\". Frawley became a part-time music teacher at Rochester Secondary College. He provided inspiration to younger musicians, teaching and mentoring acts including Dan Brodie, Tom Carlyon and Clinkerfield. Illness and death In January 2009, Frawley performed at 'Life's What You Make It', a tribute to late Melbourne band manager Linda Gebar, alongside Not Drowning, Waving, The Killjoys and others. It was his last live performance. He died on 16 May, shortly after diagnosis with liver cancer, at Rochester Hospital. He was survived by his former wife, Penny, and their son Martin. Legacy Owen, Kelly, Walker, Tex Perkins, Chrissy Amphlett, The Drones, The Kill Devil Hills, Megan Washington, Adalita, and Dan Sultan, combined to create a 3√óCD tribute album, Long Gone Whistle ‚Äì The Songs of Maurice Frawley, which was released in August 2010. On 19 August 2010, artists who contributed to the CD, performed a fund raising show at the Esplanade Hotel to raise funds to continue the music program established by Frawley at Rochester Secondary College.

It is a small tree, similar to the commonly cultivated Melaleuca styphelioides, with its prickly foliage and fluffy spikes of white or cream flowers but there are differences in the leaf arrangement and fruiting capsules.Severn River near Ballandean fruit Description Melaleuca trichostachya is a small tree, usually less than tall with white or brownish, papery bark. Its leaves are usually arranged in alternating pairs (decussate) so that they make four rows along the stem, but unlike Melaleuca linariifolia the leaves are sometimes arranged alternately. The leaves are long, wide, flat, linear to lance-shaped and tapering to a point. The flowers are white or cream-coloured and are arranged in spikes usually on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering, sometimes in the upper leaf axils. Each spike is up to in diameter and contains between 3 and 22 individual flowers. The petals are wide and fall off as the flower matures. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower and each bundle contains 34 to 105 stamens. Flowering can occur at any time of the year and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules, long in loose clusters along the stems. Unlike the fruit of Melaleuca linariifolia the valves of the fruit protrude beyond the rim of the fruiting capsule. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1848 by John Lindley in Journal of an Expedition into the Interior of Tropical Australia from the collections made during the journey of Thomas Mitchell. The specific epithet (trichostachya) is derived from the Ancient Greek words Œ∏œÅŒØŒæ (thr√≠ks) meaning ‚Äúhair‚Äù, and œÉœÑŒ¨œáœÖœÇ (stachys) meaning \\"a spike\\" or \\"an ear of corn\\" referring to the hairy appearance of the flower spikes of this plant. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca trichostachya is widely distributed in most of Queensland excluding the Cape York Peninsula. It also occurs in the southern part of the Northern Territory, eastern South Australia and north from Walgett in northern New South Wales.

Biography Zerchaninov was born on 9 March 1848 in the village of Borisov, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast to the family of an Eastern Orthodox Church priest. In June 1871 Aleksei graduated from Nizhny Novgorod Theological Seminary with a right to enter the Theological Academy. Deliberately not used this right, that they might become a priest and to pastoral work, which felt a calling. On 10 September 1871, he married and on 15 October took ordination to the priesthood. He served as rector in his native village, then became dean of Arzamas and served lawyers in several educational institutions. He was engaged in missionary work of the Synodal Church of the Old Believers, which scrutinize the Church Fathers and ecclesiastical history. More thorough study of patristics led him to the conviction of the truth of the Catholic faith. On 9 January 1896, he was in the Catholic Church. Zerchaninov was arrested 3 July 1898 and placed in Suzdal jail for religious criminals. Released at the request of Natalia Ushakova on 21 February 1901, he worked without a break on a farm, which he bought in the Nizhny Novgorod region shortly before his arrest. He was joined by the eldest son Julius, as a priest and abbot, after Father Aleksei Zerchaninov's union to the Catholic Church. At his farm he began to write books. His first work, The Kingdom of God in the world\\" he wrote during his imprisonment. Another popular essay was \\" Nepokladnye People\\" published in 1904 in Krakow under the pseudonym A.N. Zvezdina. According to the author, it almost photographically depicts the life of the Russian Orthodox clergy and what it offers to the secular power. The manuscript of the book was taken out of Russia by Polish Jesuit Father Henry Podynkovskim. Following the publication of the Manifesto of Toleration he was able to settle in Saint Petersburg. In 1905, Zerchaninov became, along with Ivan Deubner and Eustachios Susalev, a priest of his native church united with Rome celebrating Mass in Saint Petersburg. In the spring of 1907 in Rome, he was received by Pope Pius X. He was deeply moved and impressed by the kindness and good humor with which he was received by the successor of Peter, so unlike the familiar attitude of the Russian Orthodox bishops to the clergy. In Rome, he also met with the future Exarch Leonid Feodorov, then traveled to Lourdes and Lviv. On 29 June 1907, Zerchaninov was placed over the Kamenetsekoy diocese by Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky. In November 1907, he returned to Saint Petersburg where he created the Russian Greek-Catholic community. On 21 May 1908, he was appointed head of mission for the Russian Catholics of the Eastern rite. After 1912 he was the vicar of the church of Saint Catherine in Saint Petersburg. After the establishment of the Exarchate of Russian Greek Catholic Church in Russia, Father Aleksei became the secretary of the Exarch of Russian Catholics, Father Leonid Feodorov from 1917 to 1920. In 1917 he took part in the Council of the Greek Catholic clergy. On 1 May 1919, he was arrested together with Metropolitan Ropp, and released a month later. He was arrested 12 April 1920, but released after 4 days. In February 1920, he was awarded an honorary prelature. After March 1923 he headed the northern part of the Russian Greek Catholic Church Exarchate. He was arrested 19 November 1923, and in December released after signing not to leave. On 19 May 1924, Zerchaninov was sentenced to 10 years in prison, but because of advanced age this was commuted to three years in exile, initially at Yekaterinburg and then at Tobolsk. On 28 May 1926, he was arrested in Tobolsk and sent to Obdorsk. On 9 May 1927, he was released but forbidden to stay in six major cities of the USSR. He lived in Smolensk and in 1929 he moved to Nizhny Novgorod, where he died on 23 September 1933.

Umamaheswara Rao, with Revathi in the lead role. The film is about an inspiring journey of a middle-class woman to return an abandoned child to his father. Ankuram runs, in the background, issues like social stigmas, feudalism, naxalism, bureaucracy and human rights. The film was premiered at the 1993 International Film Festival of India in the mainstream section. The plot unfolds like a Chinese puzzle; it's a journey where we discover gradually the reason for the lead being harassed by the police, the blocks she faces uncovering a father's identity, and the darker side of an authoritarian police force and its brutality towards tribals.http://www.ghantasala.info/tfs/cdatad574.html The film has received the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu for that year. Plot The movie starts with the marriage of a young couple. The bride Sindhura (Revathy) finds a child on a train. She wants to support the child, against the wishes of her husband's family, until she locates the child's parents. She starts enquiring about the passenger who left his child on the train. Satyam (Om Puri), father of the child, has been on the chase by feudals and police. The police are unable to find him and arrest his pregnant wife. Tribals protested and planned to attack the police. They were stopped by Dr. Mitra (Charuhasan), a pro-tribal doctor. A sadistic officer forced the mother to do situps, resulting in loss of her life. Angered crowd killed the police officer, which caused more violence between officials and tribals. During the course of the search, Sindhura is implicated in a false case and loses her married life. She faces the threats by rowdies to her own parents and sisters. She persists with the help of Rao (Sarat Babu) (a civil liberty activist and lawyer), goes to the village, brings the atrocities towards the oppressed people to light, and returns the child. Ankuram ends with the message that citizens who can speak have the responsibility of speaking about the rights of the fellow citizens who can not speak.

It includes many different conceptions and served as a guiding principle for many political movements. It was most lively in the second half of the 19th century and in the first half of the 20th century. It is related to the concept of Turanism. Background Hungarian nobiliary historical tradition considered the Turkish peoples the closest relatives of Hungarians. This tradition was preserved in medieval chronicles (such as Gesta HungarorumAnonymus: Gesta Hungarorum. http://mek.oszk.hu/02200/02245/02245.htm and Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum,K√©zai Simon mester Magyar kr√≥nik√°ja. http://mek.oszk.hu/02200/02249/02249.htm the Chronicon Pictum, and Chronica Hungarorum by Johannes de Thurocz) as early as the 13th century. According to Chronica Hungarorum, the Hungarians are descendants of the Huns, and came from the Asian parts of Scythia, and Turks share this Scythian origin with them. This tradition served as starting point for the scientific research of the ethnogenesis of Hungarian people, which began in the 18th century, in Hungary and abroad.

It was embodied and represented by many scholars who had shared premises (i.e. the Asian origin of the Hungarians, and their kinship with Asian peoples), and who arrived at the same or very similar conclusions. Turanism was a driving force in the development of Hungarian social sciences, especially linguistics, archaeology and Orientalism. Political Turanism was born in the 19th century, in response to the growing influence of Pan-Germanism and Pan-Slavism, seen by Hungarians as very dangerous to the nation, and the state of Hungary, because the country had large ethnic German and Slavic populations. This political ideology originated in the work of the Finnish nationalist and linguist Matthias Alexander Castr√©n, who championed the ideology of Pan-Turanism ‚Äî the belief in the racial unity and future greatness of the Ural-Altaic peoples. He concluded that the Finns originated in Central Asia and far from being a small, isolated people, they were part of a larger community that included such peoples as the Magyars, the Turks, and the Mongols etc.EB on Matthias Alexander Castr√©n. http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/98799/Matthias-Alexander-Castren Political Turanism was a romantic nationalist movement, which stressed the importance of common ancestry and cultural affinity between Hungarians and the peoples of the Caucasus and Inner and Central Asia, such as the Turks, Mongols, Parsi etc. It called for closer collaboration and political alliance between them and Hungary, as a means of securing and furthering shared interests and to counter the threats posed by the policies of the great powers of Europe. The idea for a \\"Turanian brotherhood and collaboration\\" was borrowed from the Pan-Slavic concept of \\"Slavic brotherhood and collaboration\\". After the First World War, political Turanism played a role in the formation of Hungarian far-right ideologies because of its ethnic nationalist nature.Traian Sandu, Vers un profil convergent des fascismes ?: \\"Nouveau consensus\\" et religion politique en Europe centrale, Editions L'Harmattan,2010, p. 213\\"...In addition, as the cornerstone for racial nationalism, Hungarian \\"Turanism\\" came into being.

It began to carry anti-Jewish sentiments and tried to show the \\"existence and superiority of a unified Hungarian race\\". Nonetheless, Andrew C. Janos asserts that Turanism's role in the interwar development of far-right ideologies was negligible.\\"While Turanism was and remained little more than a fringe ideology of the Right, the second orientation of the national socialists, pan-Europaism, had a number of adherents, and was adopted as the platform of several national socialist groups.\\" JANOS, Andrew C.: The Politics of Backwardness in Hungary, 1825-1945. 1982. p.275. In the communist era after the Second World War, Turanism was portrayed and vilified as an exclusively fascist ideology.\\"Magyarorsz√°gon az 1944-ben uralomra jutott Nemzetszocialista P√°rt t√∂bb t√©telt √°tvett a turanizmus eszmek√∂r√©b≈ël, aminek k√∂vetkezt√©ben a turanizmus n√©pszer≈±s√©ge er≈ësen lecs√∂kkent, majd a szocializmusban ‚Äûfasiszt√°v√°‚Äù min≈ës√ºlt.\\"/\\"In Hungary the Nationsocialist Party which ascended to power in 1944, took over several theses from Turanism's range of ideas, and as a result the popularity of Turanism strongly dwindled, and then in the socialist era it was labelled as \\"fascist\\".\\"/ in: Since the fall of communism in 1989 there has been a renewal of interest in Turanism.

In his work \\"The languages of the seat of war in the East. With a survey of the three families of language, Semitic, Arian, and Turanian.\\" he called these languages \\"Turanian\\". M√ºller divided this group into two subgroups, the Southern Division, and the Northern Division. Hungarian language was classed by him as a member of this Northern Division, in the Finnic Class, in the Ugric Branch, with the Voguls and Ugro-Ostiakes as closest relatives.M√úLLER, Friedrich Max: The languages of the seat of war in the East. With a survey of the three families of language, Semitic, Arian and Turanian. 1855.https://archive.org/details/languagesseatwa00mlgoog (In the long run, his evolutionist theory about languages' structural development, tying growing grammatical refinement to socio-economic development, and grouping languages into 'antediluvian', 'familial', 'nomadic', and 'political' developmental stages M√úLLER, Friedrich Max: Letter to Chevalier Bunsen on the classification of the Turanian languages. 1854. https://archive.org/details/cu31924087972182 proved unsound, but his Northern Division was renamed and re-classed as the Ural-Altaic languages.) His theory was well known and widely discussed in international scientific circles, and was known to Hungarian scientists as well. He was invited to Budapest, the Hungarian capital, by √Årmin V√°mb√©ry, the Orientalist and Turkologist, in 1874, and become an associate member of the Hungarian Aceademy of Sciences. His public lectures received wide attention, and his terms (originally borrowed by him from Persian texts like the Shahnameh which used the term \\"Turan\\" to denote the territories of Turkestan, north of Amu Darya river, inhabited by nomadic warriors) \\"Turan\\" and \\"Turanian\\" become denizens in Hungarian language as \\"Tur√°n\\" and \\"tur√°ni\\". The meaning of these terms was never defined officially. V√°mb√©ry himself used \\"Turan\\" to denote the areas of Eastern Balkan, Central and Inner Asia inhabited by Turkic peoples, and used \\"Turanian\\" to denote those Turkic peoples and languages (and he meant the Finno-Ugric peoples and languages as the members of this group), which lived in or originated from this \\"Turan\\" area. Hungarian scientists shared his definition. But in common parlance these terms were used in many (and often different) meanings and senses. The languages of Asia and Europe arranged according to their grammatical principles in Friedrich Max M√ºller's ‚ÄûLetter to Chevalier Bunsen on the classification of the Turanian languages‚Äù, published in 1854. Hungarians have had a thousand year old, and still living tradition about the Asian origins of Magyars. This tradition was preserved in medieval chronicles (such as Gesta Hungarorum and Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum) as early as the 13th century. This tradition served as starting point for the scientific research of the ethnogenesis of Hungarian people, which began in the 18th century, in Hungary and abroad.

Boxhorn conjectured that the European and Indo-Iranian languages were all derived from a shared ancestor language, and he named this ancestor language \\"Scythian\\", after the equestrian, nomadic warriors of the Asian steppes. But linguists theorizing about ancestor languages had to deal with the common belief of the era, that, according to the Bible, Hebrew was the original language of all humans. Leibniz published material countering the Biblical theory, and supported Boxhorn's notion of a Scythian ancestor language. \\"Information about hither-to unknown peoples and languages of Asia and the Americas came into the hands of scholars such as Gottfried Leibniz, who recognized that there was no better method ‚Äúfor specifying the relationship and origin of the various peoples of the earth, than the comparison of their languages‚Äù. In order to classify as many languages as possible in genealogical groupings, Leibniz proposed that similar materials be collected from each newly described language. To this end he asked that explorers either obtain translations of well-known Christian prayers such as the Pater Noster, or, better yet, ‚Äúwords for common things‚Äù (vocabula rerum vulgarium), a sample list of which he appended to a letter to the Turkologist D. Podesta (Leibniz 1768/1989b).The word list included numerals, kinship terms, body parts, necessitates (food, drink, weapons,domestic animals), naturalia (God, celestial and weather phenomena, topographic features, wild animals) and a dozen verbs (eat, drink, speak, see ‚Ä¶). Leibniz took a particular interest in the expansion of the Russian Empire southward and eastward, and lists based on his model were taken on expeditions sent by the tsars to study the territories recently brought under their control, as well as the peoples living on these and on nearby lands.\\" Kevin Tuite: The rise and fall and revival of the Ibero-Caucasian hypothesis. 2008. in: Historiographia Linguistica, 35 #1; p. 23-82. Leibniz recognized that the Semitic languages such as Hebrew and Arabic, and some European languages like Sami, Finnish, and Hungarian did not belong to the same language family as most of the languages of Europe. He recognized the connection between the Finnish languages and Hungarian. He placed the original homeland of the Hungarians to the Volga-Caspian Sea region. These theories had a great impact on the research of the origins of the Hungarian language and the ethnogenesis of Hungarian nation. Both of the two main views/theories about the origin of the Hungarian people and language, the one about the Turkic origin, and the other about the Finno-Ugric origin had their scientific roots in them. Tourkia (i.e. Hungary)\\" on the Holy Crown of Hungary, from the 11th century. In fact, the Turkic theory matched the tradition (the Gestas) and historical sources (like the works of Constantine VII and Leo VI the Wise) better, but the accounts and works of travelers like Swedish Philip Johan von Strahlenberg (published in his work:\\" An historico-geographical description of the north and east parts of Europe and Asia \\") turned the attention to the \\"Finnish- Hungarian connection\\".STRAHLENBERG, Philipp Johann von: An historico- geographical description of the north and east parts of Europe and Asia http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/010825073 Philipp Johann von Strahlenberg about the kinship of Finnish and Hungarian language, in his book \\"An historico-geographical description of the north and east parts of Europe and Asia\\" 1738. London. Johann Eberhard Fischer (1697-1771) was a German historian and language researcher, who participated in the Great Northern Expedition of 1733-1743. In his work ‚ÄúQvaestiones Petropolitanae, De origine Ungrorum‚Äù, published in 1770, he put Hungarian into a group of kindred peoples and languages which he called 'Scythian'. He considered the Ugric peoples (he called them ‚ÄòJugors‚Äô, these are the Khanty and Mansi) the closest relatives of Hungarians, actually as ‚ÄòMagyars left behind‚Äô, and originated them from the Uyghurs, who live on the western frontiers of China. The followers of the \\"Turkist\\" and \\"Ugrist\\" theories lived together peacefully, and the theories were refined as science developed. (In fact the two theories converged, as linguists, like Rasmus Christian Rask, Wilhelm Schott (1802-1889) and Matthias Castr√©n recognized the similarities and connection between Finn-Ugric and Altaic languages. The German linguist and Orientalist Schott was a proponent of Finn-Turk-Hungarian kinship, and considered the Hungarians a mixture of Turks and Hyperboreans / i.e. Saami, Samoyed etc. /.\\" Die Stammv√§ter der Magyaren in Ungarn waren, wie die Geschichte leise andeutet und der Ur-Kern ihrer Sprache zu best√§tigen scheint, ein Gemisch von T√ºrken und Hyperboreern.

Questions of nation, language, national origin became politically sensitive matters. Anti-Habsburg and anti- German sentiments were strong. A large number of freedom fighters took refuge in the Ottoman Empire. This resulted in renewed cultural exchange, and mutual sympathy. Turks were seen by many as good allies of the Hungarian cause. Such was the atmosphere, when V√°mb√©ry traveled to Constantinople in 1857 for the first time. \\"It should happen and it will happen - I encouraged myself with this, and did not hurt me other problems, just this one: how could I get a passport from the strict and suspicious Austrian authorities, and exactly to Turkey, where the Hungarian emigration resided, and, as was believed in Vienna, made rebellious plans tirelessly.\\" \\"Mennie kell √©s menni fog, - ezzel biztattam magam √©s nem b√°ntott m√°s gond, csak az az egy: hogy mi √∫ton-m√≥don kaphatok √∫tlevelet a szigor√∫ √©s gyanakv√≥ osztr√°k hat√≥s√°gt√≥l; hozz√° m√©g √©pen T√∂r√∂korsz√°gba, hol akkor a magyar emigr√°czi√≥ tartotta sz√©k√©t √©s, mint B√©csben hitt√©k, p√°rt√ºt≈ë terveket sz≈ë f√°radhatatlan√∫l.\\" in: V√°mb√©ry √Årmin: K√ºzdelmeim.

The Habsburg government saw this \\"Turkism\\" as dangerous to the empire, but had no means to suppress it. (The Habsburg Empire lost large territories in the early 19th century /Flanders and Luxembourg/, and lost most of its Italian holdings a little later, so many members of the Austrian political elite (Franz Joseph I of Austria himself, Archduke Albrecht, Duke of Teschen, major general Ferdinand Franz Xaver Johann Freiherr Mayerhofer von Gr√ºnb√ºhel for example)KOS, Franz Josef: Die Politik √ñsterreich- Ungarns w√§hrend der Okkupationskrise 1874/75-1879.

Pest As a consequence of the Franco-Austrian War and the Austro-Prussian War, the Habsburg Empire was on the verge of collapse in 1866, because these misfortunate military endeavours resulted in increased state spending, speeding inflation, towering state debts and financial crisis.GOOD, David F.: The Economic Rise of the Habsburg Empire, 1750-1914. 1984. p.82. The Habsburgs were forced to reconcile with Hungary, to save their empire and dynasty. The Habsburgs and part of the Hungarian political elite arranged the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867. The Compromise was arranged and legitimated by a very small part of the Hungarian society (suffrage was very limited: less than 8 percent of the population had voting rights), and was seen by a very large part of the population as betrayal of the Hungarian cause and the heritage of the 1848-49 War of Independence.\\"A kiegyez√©ses rendszert ugyanis a t√°rsadalom sz√©lesebb k√∂rei, a paraszts√°g, a kispolg√°rs√°g ‚Äì ak√°r igazuk volt, ak√°r nem ‚Äì elutas√≠tott√°k.

Academic science remained under state scrutiny and pressure, and press remained under (albeit more permissive) censorship. Matters of nation, language, national origin remained politically sensitive themes, and Turkism remained popular. \\"However, to get the Compromise accepted within the society posed serious difficulties. Many counties (for example Heves, Pest, Szatm√°r) rejected the Compromise and stood up for Kossuth, the opposition organized a network of Democratic circles, on the Great Hungarian Plain anti-government and anti-Compromise demonstrations of several thousand men took place, etc. The government, suspending its liberal principles, decided to take firm counter moves: imprisoned L√°szl√≥ B√∂sz√∂rm√©nyi who published the Kossuth letters, banned the Democratic circles, sent a royal commissioner to the most resistant Heves County.

After a long and perilous journey he arrived at Pest in May 1864. He went to London to arrange the English language publication of his book about the travels. \\"Travels in Central Asia\\" and its Hungarian counterpart \\"K√∂z√©p-√°zsiai utaz√°s\\" were published in 1865. Thanks to his travels V√°mb√©ry became an internationally renowned writer and celebrity. He became acquainted with members of British social elite. The Ambassador of Austria in London gave him a letter of recommendation to the Emperor, who received him in an audience and rewarded V√°mb√©ry's international success by granting him professorship in the Royal University of Pest. V√°mb√©ry published his \\"V√°mb√©ry √Årmin v√°zlatai K√∂z√©p- √Åzsi√°b√≥l. Ujabb adal√©kok az oxusmell√©ki orsz√°gok n√©pismereti, t√°rsadalmi √©s politikai viszonyaihoz.\\" in 1868. Perhaps this was the first instance of the use of the word \\"tur√°ni\\" in a Hungarian language scientific text. At the beginning of Hungarian Turanism, some of its notable promoters and researchers, like √Årmin V√°mb√©ry, Vilmos Hevesy,http://mtda.hu/books/zajti_ferenc_magyar_evezredek.pdf (Also known as Wilhelm von Hevesy(1877-1945) He was the older brother of Gy√∂rgy Hevesy, and an electrical engineer by profession, although he was kind of a Finno-Ugrist publishing books and other writings about the Finno-Ugric-Munda kinship, like \\"Munda-Magyar-Maori, an Indian link between the antipodes new tracks of Hungarian origins\\" and \\"Finnisch-Ugrisches aus Indien\\" in the 1920s and 30's.DRIEM, George van: Languages of the Himalayas: an ethnolinguistic handbook. 1997. p.161-162.) and Ign√°c GoldziherHANEBRINK, Paul: Islam, Anti- Communism, and Christian Civilization: The Ottoman Menace in Interwar Hungary, Cambridge JournalsSteven Totosy de Zepetnek, Louise O. Vasvari: Comparative Hungarian Cultural Studies (page:48) were Jewish or of Jewish descent (V√°mb√©ry was neither proud nor ashamed of his Jewish ancestry, he became a member of the Reformed Church, and considered himself Hungarian). V√°mb√©ry was a key figure in the development of Turanism, and in the development of the \\"scientific consciousness\\" of the general public. He was a talented writer: he presented serious scientific matters in an interesting, readable manner. His enjoyable books and other writings, presenting customs, traditions and culture of far-flung peoples and faraway places were key in raising wide public interest in ethnography, ethnology and history. In fact, the power of his books, coupled with the widespread disillusionment about the political elite turned public attention to the lower classes and peasantry, as better heirs and keepers of real Hungarian legacy.(The neologists of the first half of the 19th century had turned towards folklore, myths, ballads and tales in their search of a new national literary style, but had not had interest in other aspects of rural peasant life.) V√°mb√©ry's later work, entitled \\"Magyar √©s t√∂r√∂k-tat√°r sz√≥egyez√©sek.\\"V√ÅMB√âRY √Årmin: Magyar √©s t√∂r√∂k-tat√°r sz√≥egyez√©sek.\\" In Nyelvtudom√°nyi k√∂zlem√©nyek VIII. p. 109-189.http://www.nytud.hu/nyk/reg/008.pdf and published in 1869-70, was the casus belli of the \\"Ugor-t√∂r√∂k h√°bor√∫\\" (\\"Ugric-Turk War\\"), which started as a scientific dispute, but quickly turned into a long-lasting (it raged for two decades) bitter feud. In this work V√°mb√©ry tried to prove with the help of word comparisons, that as a result of intermingling of the early Hungarians with Turkic peoples, the Hungarian language got a distinct dual (Ugric AND Turkic) character, albeit it is basically Ugric in origin, so he presented a variant of linguistic contact theory. \\"...the Hungarian language is Ugric in its origin, but because the nations later contact and historical transformation it is equally Ugric and Turkic in character...\\" \\"...a magyar nyelv eredet√©ben ugor, de a nemzet k√©s≈ëbbi √©rintkez√©se √©s t√∂rt√©neti √°talakul√°s√°n√°l fogva egyform√°n ugor √©s t√∂r√∂k jellem≈±...\\" in: V√°mb√©ry √Årmin: Magyar √©s t√∂r√∂k-tat√°r sz√≥egyez√©sek. p. 120. The \\"Ugric-Turkic War\\" \\"The fight, which my fanatical opponents, regrettably, brought over also to the field of personal remarks, lasted quite a long time, but the old Latin proverb was proven once again: Philologi certant, tamen sub judice lis.\\" \\"A k√ºzdelem, melyet fanatikus ellenfeleim, sajnos, √°tvittek a szem√©lyesked√©s ter√©re is, eltartott j√≥ sok√°ig, de ez√∫ttal is bev√°lt a r√©gi di√°k k√∂zmond√°s: Philologi certant, tamen sub judice lis.\\" in: V√°mb√©ry √Årmin: K√ºzdelmeim.

Budenz criticised V√°mb√©ry and his work in an aggressive, derogatory style, and questioned V√°mb√©ry's (scientific) honesty and credibility.

In this book he stresses the very strong connection between language and nation (p. 48.), tries to prove that the Huns were Finn-Ugric (p. 122.), questions the credibility and origin of the Gestas (p. 295.), concludes that the Huns, Bulgars and Avars were Ugric (p. 393.), mentions, that the Jews are more prolific than other peoples, so the quickly growing number of them presents a real menace for the nation (p. 420.), and stresses what an important and eminent role the Germans played in the development of Hungarian culture and economy (p. 424.). In his work titled \\"V√°mb√©ry √Årmin: A magyarok eredete. Ethnologiai tanulm√°ny.\\",V√ÅMB√âRY √Årmin: A magyarok eredete. Ethnologiai tanulm√°ny.1882.http://digitalia.lib.pte.hu/?p=3265 and published in 1882, V√°mb√©ry went a step further, and presented a newer version of his theory, in which he claimed that Hungarian nation and language are basically Turkic in origin, and the Finn-Ugric element in them is a result of later contact and intermingling. \\"...I see a compound people in Hungarians, in which not the Finn-Ugric, but the Turkic-Tatar component gives the true core...\\" \\"...a magyarban vegy√ºl√©k n√©pet l√°tok, a melyben nem finn-ugor, hanem t√∂r√∂k-tat√°r elem k√©pezi a tulajdonk√©peni magvat...\\" in: V√°mb√©ry √Årmin: A magyarok eredete.

V√°mb√©ry's work was criticized heavily by his Finno-Ugrist opponents. This critique gave rise to the ever-circling myth of the \\"fish-smelling kinship\\" and its variants. No one of the authors has ever given the written source/base of this accusation against the Turanist scientists. In fact, Turanist scientists did not write such things about the Finn-Ugric peoples, and V√°mb√©ry and his followers mentioned these kin of Hungarians with due respect. In reality it was coined by the Finno-Ugrist Ferdin√°nd Barna, in his work \\"V√°mb√©ry √Årmin A magyarok eredete cz√≠m≈± m≈±ve n√©h√°ny f≈ëbb √°ll√≠t√°s√°nak b√≠r√°lata.\\" (‚ÄúCritique of some main statements of √Årmin V√°mb√©ry‚Äôs work, titled ‚ÄòThe origin of Hungarians‚Äô.‚Äù) published in 1884.

He considered Hungarian a contact language, more precisely a mixed language, having not just one but two (Finno-Ugric AND Turkic) genetic ancestors. His strongest evidences were the large corpus of ancient Turkish words in Hungarian word-stock (300-400 for a minimum, and even more with good alternative Turkic etymologies),R√ìNA-TAS, Andr√°s and BERTA, √Årp√°d: West Old Turkic. Turkic Loanwords in Hungarian. 2011. and the strong typological similarity of Hungarian and Turkic languages. His Finno-Ugrist opponents strongly rejected not only the fact of such mixing and dual ancestry, but even the theoretical possibility of it. But, in the context of linguistics the use of a strictly binary family tree model proved unfruitful and problematic over the years. We have seen the Uralic tree disintegrate and flatten into a ‚Äúcomb‚Äù, and the place of Samoyedic languages and Yukaghir languages within/in relation to the other members is still very problematic. Some scientists questioned seriously even the existence of Uralic as valid language family,PUSZTAY J√°nos: The so-called Uralic original home (Urheimat) and the so-called Proto-Uralic.

One attitude towards mixed languages has been that they simply do not exist, and that the claims for mixed languages are instances of a naive use of the term. The inhibition to accept the existence of mixed languages is linked to the fact that it was inconceivable how they could emerge, and moreover their mere existence posited a threat to the validity of the comparative method and to genetic linguistics.‚Äù The \\"Ugric-Turkic War\\" was never closed properly. This forced scientists to try to harmonize and synthesize the differing theories somehow. This resulted in the development of a complex national mythology. This combined the Asian roots and origins of Magyars with their European present. Turanism got a new meaning: it became the given name of a variant of Orientalism, which researched Asia and its culture in context of Hungarian history and culture. Turanism was a driving force in the development of Hungarian social sciences, especially linguistics, ethnography, history, archaeology, and Orientalism, and in the development of Hungarian arts, from architecture to applied and decorative arts. Turanist scientists greatly contributed to the development of Hungarian and international science and arts. This is a short list of Turkist/Turanist scientists and artists, who have left a lasting legacy in Hungarian culture: *√Årmin V√°mb√©ry (1832-1913) was the founding father of Hungarian Turkology.

The Society arranged Turkish, Finnish and Japanese language courses. The Turan Society arranged and funded five expeditions into Asia till 1914.(The M√©sz√°ros- Milleker expedition, the Timk√≥ expedition, the Milleker expedition, the Kov√°cs-Holzwarth expedition, and the Seb≈ëk-Schutz expedition.) The Society held public lectures regularly.

In 1916, the Turan Society was redressed into the \\"Magyar Keleti Kult√∫rk√∂zpont\\" (Hungarian Eastern Cultural Centre), and direct governmental influence over its operation grew. The defeat in the First World War, and the following revolutionary movements and Entente occupation of the country disrupted the operation of the Eastern Cultural Centre, so real work began only in 1920. But the organisation was split into three that year, because of pronounced internal ideological stresses. Those who wanted a more scincelike approach formed the \\"K≈ër√∂si Csoma-T√°rsas√°g\\" (K≈ër√∂si Csoma Society). The more radical political turanists left the Turan Society, and formed the \\"Magyarorsz√°gi Tur√°n Sz√∂vets√©g\\" (Turan Federation of Hungary). Archduke Joseph Francis Habsburg, the first patron of the Hungarian Turan Society In 1920, Archduke Joseph Francis of Austria (Archduke Joseph Francis Habsburg) became the first patron of the Hungarian Turan Society Political Turanism Hungarians and their ancestors lived amongst or in direct contact with Turanian/Turkic peoples from time immemorial to 1908. (A common Hungarian-Turkish border ceased to exist after 1908, in the wake of the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the evacuation of the Sanjak of Novibazar.) These peoples played an eminent role in the birth and formation of Hungarian people, language, culture, state and nation. During the ethnogenesis of Hungarian people Kabar, J√°sz (Alan), Avar, Bulgar, Beseny≈ë (Pecheneg), Kun (Cuman) tribes and population fragments merged and amalgamated into the Hungarian population. Hungary warred with the Ottoman Empire for centuries. As a result of a discord of succession Hungary broke up into three parts in the 16th century: one was under Habsburg rule, one became part of the Ottoman Empire (1541.VIII.29.), and the third formed the ‚Äúkeleti Magyar Kir√°lys√°g‚Äù (Eastern Hungarian Kingdom)/ ‚ÄúErd√©lyi Fejedelems√©g‚Äù (Principality of Transylvania). Erd√©ly became an ally of the Ottomans (1528.II. 29.).MAKKAI L√°szl√≥, M√ìCSY Andr√°s eds.: Erd√©ly t√∂rt√©nete. Els≈ë k√∂tet. 1986. p.409-421. http://mek.oszk.hu/02100/02109/html/93.html The intensive everyday contacts in the one and a half centuries that followed resulted in pronounced Ottoman Turkish influence on Hungarian art and culture from music to jewellery and clothing, from agriculture to warfare. In the last third of the 17th century strife intensified between the Ottomans and the Habsburgs. The main scene of these power struggles was the territory of Hungary. The Ottoman attempts at further territorial expansion failed in the end and the Habsburgs reconquered the Hungarian territories. But there was a conflict in the circles of Hungarian political elite: many members of it were unwilling to swap the Ottoman alliance for direct Habsburg rule. A large group aspired for full independence, but felt Turkish dependence more amenable than Habsburg reign. Th√∂k√∂ly's liberation movement and R√°k√≥czi's War of Independence meant the climax of this Turkism. So, as one can see, Turkish orientation had a long tradition in Hungary. Turkism was reborn in the wake of the 1848-49 War of Independence. During the war Hungary was attacked by the Habsburgs, and many of her ethnic minorities turned against the country. Serious clashes occurred between the Hungarians and the Vlachs of Eastern Hungary and the Serbs of the South. There were serious atrocities against ethnic Hungarians; these events are remembered as \\"ol√°hj√°r√°sok\\" and \\"r√°cj√°r√°sok\\" (\\"Vlach rampages\\" and \\"Rascian rampages\\").BOTLIK J√≥zsef: Magyarellenes atrocit√°sok a K√°rp√°t- medenc√©ben. http://adattar.vmmi.org/fejezetek/1896/07_magyarellenes_atrocitasok_a_karpat_medenceben.pdf Hungary was defeated with the help of Russian military intervention. These painful events and experiences changed Hungarians' attitudes profoundly: They began to feel themselves insecure and endangered in their own home. From this time on, Pan-Slavism and Pan-Germanism were seen as serious threats to the existence of Hungary and Hungarians. Hungarians looked for allies and friends to secure their position. They turned towards the rivals of the Habsburgs - to Turkey, to the Italians, even to the Prussians - for support and help. Hungarians were interested in a stable, strong and friendly Turkey, capable of preventing Russian and/or Habsburg expansion in the Balkans. Hungarian political movements and attempts to regain independence proved unfruitful. At the same time, the Habsburgs were unable to acquire the leading position of the German union, and Germany became united under Prussian rule. The Habsburgs took their empire to the verge of collapse with a series of miscalculated political and military moves. This led to the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867. The Hungarian supporters of the Compromise have argued that the already weakened Austria is no longer a threat to the Hungarians, but can help prevent Slavic expansion. Despite the Compromise, the Hungarians were ambivalent towards these old-new Austrian allies. \\"If the balance of opinion in Hungary were always determined by sober political calculation, this brave and independent people, isolated in the broad ocean of Slav populations, and comparatively insignificant in numbers, would remain constant to the conviction that its position can only be secured by the support of the German element in Austria and Germany. But the Kossuth episode, and the suppression in Hungary itself of the German elements that remained loyal to the Empire, with other symptoms showed that among Hungarian hussars and lawyers self confidence is apt in critical moments to get the better of political calculation and self-control. Even in quiet times many a Magyar will get the gypsies to play to him the song, 'Der Deutsche ist ein Hundsfott' ('The German is a blackguard').\\" Bismarck, Otto von: Bismarck, the man and the statesman: being the reflections and reminiscences of Otto, Prince von Bismarck. 1898.

In the half-century prior to the First World War, some Hungarians encouraged Turanism as a means of uniting Turks and Hungarians against the perils posed by the Slavs and Pan-Slavism. However Pan-Turanism was never more than an outrider to the more prevalent Pan-Turkist movement.EB on Pan-Turanianism. http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/440695/Pan- Turanianism Turanism helped in the creation of the important Turkish-Austro- Hungarian and Bulgarian-Austro-Hungarian military and strategic alliances. The movement received impetus after Hungary's defeat in World War I. Under the terms of the Treaty of Trianon (1920.VI.4.), the new Hungarian state constituted only 32,7 percent of the territory of historic, pre-treaty Hungary, and lost 58,4 percent of its total population. More than 3,2 million ethnic Hungarians, one-third of all Hungarians resided outside the new boundaries of Hungary, in the successor states, under oppressive conditions.PORTIK Erzs√©bet-Edit: Erd√©lyi magyar kisebbs√©gi sorsk√©rd√©sek a k√©t vil√°gh√°bor√∫ k√∂z√∂tt.

Under these circumstances no Hungarian government could survive without seeking justice for Magyars and Hungary. Reuniting the Magyars became a crucial point in public life and on the political agenda. Public sentiment became strongly anti-Western, anti-French, and anti-British. Outrage led many to reject Europe and turn towards the East in search of new friends and allies in a bid to revise the terms of the treaty and restore Hungarian power. \\"Disappointment towards Europe caused by 'the betrayal of the West in Trianon', and the pessimistic feeling of loneliness, led different strata in society towards Turanism. They tried to look for friends, kindred peoples and allies in the East so that Hungary could break out of its isolation and regain its well deserved position among the nations. A more radical group of conservative, rightist people, sometimes even with an anti-Semitic hint propagated sharply anti-Western views and the superiority of Eastern culture, the necessity of a pro-Eastern policy, and development of the awareness of Turanic racialism among Hungarian people.‚Äù in: Uhalley, Stephen and Wu, Xiaoxin eds.: China and Christianity.

Turanism never became official, because it was out of accord with the Christian conservatist ideological background of the regime. But it was used by the government as an informal tool to break the country‚Äôs international isolation, and build alliances.

The elite wanted to see itself as a military nation.The claims of certain linguistic researchers regarding the Finno-Ugric relationship were therefore strongly rejected, because many found the idea that their nation was related to a peaceful farming people (the Finns) as insulting...The extremist Turanians insisted on ‚Äúties of ancestry‚Äù with the Turkish peoples, Tibet, Japan and even the Sumerians, and held the view that Jesus was not a Jew but a Hungarian or a ‚Äúnoble of Parthia‚Äù.\\"See Ungv√°ry Turanism and Hungarian fascism According to Andrew C. J√°nos, while some Hungarian Turanists went as far as to argue they were racially healthier than and superior to other Europeans (including Germans, who were already corrupted by Judaism), others felt more modestly, that as Turanians living in Europe, they might provide an important bridge between East and West and thus play a role in world politics out of proportion of their numbers or the size of their country. This geopolitical argument was taken to absurd extremes by Ferenc Sz√°lasi, head of the Arrow Cross-Hungarist movement, who believed that, owing to their unique historical and geographical position, Hungarians might play a role equal to, or even more important than, Germany in building the new European order, while Sz√°lasi's own charisma might eventually help him supersede Hitler as leader of the international movement.J√ÅNOS, Andrew C.: East Central Europe in the Modern World Stanford University Press, 2002 pp.185-186 Ferenc Sz√°lasi, the leader of the Hungarian Arrow Cross Party believed in the existence of a genuine Turanian-Hungarian race (to the extent that his followers went about making anthropological surveys, collecting skull measurements) that was crucial for his ideology of \\"Hungarism\\". Sz√°lasi was himself a practicing Catholic and wavered between a religious and a racial basis for Hungarism. The unique vocation of ‚ÄúTuranian‚Äù (Turkic) Hungary was its capacity for mediating and uniting both east and west, Europe and Asia, the Christian Balkans and the Muslim Middle East, and from this stemmed its ultimate vocation to lead the world order through culture and example, a task that neither Italy nor Germany was prepared to accomplish.PAYNE, Stanley: A History of Fascism, 1914-1945. 1995. p.272.  Turanism after 1945  After the Second World War the Soviet Red Army occupied Hungary. The Hungarian government was placed under the direct control of the administration of the occupying forces. All Turanist organisations were disbanded by the government, and the majority of Turanist publications was banned and confiscated. In 1948 Hungary was converted into a communist one-party state. Turanism was portrayed and vilified as an exclusively fascist ideology, although Turanism's role in the interwar development of far-right ideologies was negligible. The official prohibition lasted until the collapse of the socialist regime in 1989.  Turanism after 1989   Christian Turanists  Jesus Christ as Parthian-Hungarian warrior prince A Hungarian non-commissioned officer Ferenc J√≥s Badiny wrote his book ( J√©zus Kir√°ly, a p√°rtus herceg) \\"King Jesus, the Parthian prince\\", where he invented the theory of Jesus the Parthian warrior prince. Many Christian Hungarian Turanists held the view that Jesus Christ was not a Jew but a proto- Hungarian or a ‚Äúnoble of Parthia‚Äù. The theory of ‚ÄúJesus, the Parthian prince‚Äù are such, or the revivification of real or supposed elements of priest- magicians of ancient ‚Äúmagic‚Äù Middle-Eastern world, shamanism, and pagan ancient Hungarian religion. Also some Muslim Turkish Turanists held the view that Muhammad was not an Arab but a Sumerian, and Sumerians are Turanid according to Turanist theses. It is an opportunity for the Christian Turanists to link Jesus to the ancient Middle-Eastern mystery and the ancient pagan Hungarian beliefs. Both Catholic and Protestant religious leaders of Hungary acted against this theory and beliefs. The Jobbik party and its former president G√°bor Vona are uncompromising supporters of Turanism (the ideology of Jobbik considers Hungarians as a Turanian nation).http://www.jobbik.com/jobbik_news/europe/3198.html Great Kurult√°j The Great Kurult√°j is a tribal assembly based on the common heritage of the peoples of Central Asian nomadic origin. (Azerbaijani, Bashkirs, Bulgarians, Buryats, Chuvash, Gagauz, Hungarians, Karachays, Karakalpaks, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Manchus, Mongols, Nogai, Tatars, Turks, Turkmen, Uighurs, √úzbeks, Yakuts etc.) It is also a popular tourist attraction in Hungary (from late 2000s) and Central Asia. The first Kurult√°j was in Kazakhstan in 2007 and the last one was organized in 2014 at Bugac, Hungary. In the 1990s, a well developed souvenir and merchandise business has grown around Turanism, traditionalist and historical reenactment groups, which is quite similar to other well known international examples of business of this kind. According to the opinion of Hungarian researcher Igaz Levente this merchandise industry grown around modern Hungarian Turanism became a kind of business, which he called \\"Szittya biznisz\\" (Scythian business), and it has not got much to do with ancient Hungarian traditions. Pseudoscientific theories Hungarian Turanism has been characterized by pseudoscientific theories. According to these theories, Hungarians share supposed Ural-Altaic origins with Bulgarians, Estonians, Mongols, Finns, Turkic peoples, and even Japanese people and Koreans. Origins of the Hungarian people with the Huns, Scythians or even Sumerians have been suggested by proponents of these theories. Such beliefs gained widespread support in Hungary in the interwar period. Though since widely discredited, these theories have regained support among certain Hungarian political parties, in particular among Jobbik and certain factions of Fidesz.

Underside strongly suffused with purple- pink. The eggs are reddish grey. The larva is light or dark grey with a black brown head. The entire body is covered with foxy red hairs.Kimmo Silvonen Larvae of North-European Lepidoptera These hairs are always more black brown in placida, and sometimes so in fuliginosa. The pupa is black with the abdomen marked with yellow in the segmental incision. Variations Phragmatobia fuliginosa borealis has vivid black markings and the red is confined to the sides of the abdomen and the anal part of the hindwing. Phragmatobia fuliginosa ab. subnigra Mill., that has very dark forewings, must not be confused with the northern form; it is scarcely darker than true fuliginosa, and not so strongly hyaline as borealis. In Phragmatobia fuliginosa ab. flavescens Schultz the abdomen and hindwing are yellow instead of red. The full species Phragmatobia amurensis Seitz, 1910 is a form of the same size as Phragmatobia fervida, but is in colour it is almost exactly like fuliginosa, the forewing however being broader. Phragmatobia pulverulenta Alph. is a transition to fervida, the forewing being lighter than in fuliginosa, more yellowish brown, and the hindwing lighter and clearer, more flesh-colour, and with well-defined marginal spots. Phragmatobia fuliginosa fervida Stgr., from Turkestan and northern China, is the largest and lightest form. The forewings are strongly tinged with yellowish red, and therefore almost the same colour as the hindwings, the latter bear strongly reduced dots. Phragmatobia placida Friv., from South-East Europe, Asia, Minor and Turkestan, is a very large form, usually regarded as a separate species [Phragmatobia placida (Frivaldszky, 1835)], with the forewing more triangular and uniformly dark brown, and the hindwing pure light pink spotted with black. The forewing bears a carmine dot at the upper angle of the cell. Biology The moth flies from May to August depending on the location. It is double-brooded in the south of England, flying in April to June, and again in August and September. In the north it is a univoltine species, with just one generation in June.UK Moths The caterpillars are polyphagous, feeding on various plants, mainly Rubus fruticosus, Prunus spinosa, Filipendula ulmaria, Plantago lanceolata, Senecio jacobaea, Salix repens, Salix starkeana, Salix phylicifolia, Polygonum spp., Rumex crispus, Potentilla erecta, Rubus idaeus, Trifolium spp., Chamaenerion angustifolium, Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium myrtillus, Vaccinium uliginosum, Andromeda polifolia, Plantago major, Taraxacum vulgare and Taraxacum officinale.

It is written by and stars Neil Edmond as Ian Dunn, a long suffering market researcher. The series also co-stars Paula Wilcox as Ian's boss, Mary. The programme, produced by Tilusha Ghelani, was first broadcast between 19 November and 24 December 2007. Plot Knocker revolves around the unfortunate tale of Ian Dunn, who works as the sole surviving market researcher for International Query Board UK. His position as the only member of the Board who actually goes out of the office to canvas the opinions of the public is not surprising, considering what has to put up with on a day-to-day basis. Ian has to put up with all kinds of bad weather, while trying to ask complete strangers about personal details on the street or at their homes. As a result, most people are hostile to him and he hardly ever gets any work done. The only people Ian ever manages to interview successfully tend to be those who are in it only to gain something from him, or because they are on the verge of insanity. Ian also has to manage his problems with his boss, Mary. While Ian believes he is trying to be kind to her, she just wants him to get as many responses to his surveys as he possibly can. She even suggests to Ian that he should break the rules, but Ian considers breaking the Market Research Code of Conduct unacceptable, even if it would make his job easier. While not sorting out Ian's problems, Mary usually tries to solve those of Andre, a character who never appears, but is constantly referred to as someone who is accident prone.

He led both German North Polar Expeditions. Life and career Koldewey was the son of merchant Johann Christian Koldewey and his wife Wilhelmine Meyer. Koldewey enrolled as a sailor in 1853 immediately after Grammar school at Clausthal. At age 22, he attended the Naval school in Bremen, where he was among Arthur Breusing's best pupils. Later he went to sea again but returned to Naval school in 1861. After becoming a captain, Koldewey studied mathematics, physics, and astronomy at the universities of Hanover and G√∂ttingen between 1866 and 1867. Expeditions Through his teacher Breusing and encouraged by August Petermann Koldewey was given the leadership of the first Arctic expedition as captain of ship Gr√∂nland. He had the choice of either advancing northwards as far as possible along Greenland's east coast or to reach so-called Gillis-Land by travelling around Spitsbergen. But adverse conditions and strong ice floes prevented him from reaching both destinations. Finally he reached his northmost latitude of 81¬∞5' near Spitsbergen and returned. From 1869 to 1870 he was captain of the Germania and the leader of another expedition to Greenland and to the Arctic Sea which intended to penetrate into the Arctic central region. It was equipped with the propeller steamboat Germania and the sailing ship Hansa under captain Paul Friedrich Hegemann. Six scientists joined the expedition: astronomers and physicists Karl Nikolai Jensen B√∂rgen and Ralph Copeland, zoologist, botanist and physician Adolf Pansch, and surveyor Julius von Payer. On the Hansa travelled physician and zoologist Reinhold Wilhelm Buchholz and geologist Gustav Carl Laube. The expedition left Bremerhaven on 15 June 1869. Already on 20 July both ships were separated. The Hansa was crushed by the ice on 19 October 1869 and the crew saved itself on an ice floe. Meanwhile, the Germania reached Sabine Island on 5 August 1869. From there the task of mapping out of the coast between 73¬∞ and 77¬∞ northern latitude was undertaken by taking measurements from the ship or using sleighs and whalers. This work was a continuation of Edward Sabine's 1823 expedition. Trying to reach the North pole, the Germania reached its northernmost latitude 75¬∞30'N on August 14 northeast of Shannon Island, where they had to return on account of lack of leads in the ice. Payer carried out the mapping of Shannon island while the astronomers took latitude measurements on it. A wintering camp was established at Sabine island from 27 August 1869 to 22 July 1870. Advancing inland using sleighs, the islands and coast of Greenland were mapped. Further investigations were carried out that provide an insight into the magnitude of Greenland's mountains and glaciers. However, the actual highlight and most considerable geographical achievement of the expedition was the discovery and investigation of Kaiser Franz Joseph Fjord. Later work After finishing the expeditions Koldewey worked as a writer and took part in scientific publications. Since 1871 he worked at the German naval observatory in Hamburg, whose Nautical Instruments department he took over in 1875. On 31 July 1905 he retired as an admiralty's director. One of his nephews, Robert Koldewey (1855-1925), became a famous archaeologist and architecture historian.

Mills was selected to play at prop forward for Great Britain in all three Ashes tests of the 1978 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France. He also played in Widnes' victory over the touring Australian side. The Open Rugby inaugural World XIII was revealed in June 1978 and included Mills. He played left- in the 16-4 victory over Warrington in the 1978‚Äì79 John Player Trophy Final at Knowsley Road, St. Helens on Saturday 28 April 1979, and played as an interchange/substitute (replacing Brian Hogan) in the 0-6 defeat by Bradford Northern in the 1979‚Äì80 John Player Trophy Final at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 5 January 1980. Post-playing Mills was also one of the original thirteen former Widnes players inducted into the Widnes Hall of Fame in 1992. That year he also worked as team manager for the Welsh national team. Jim Mills is the father of the rugby league footballer; David Mills.

Tubridy had two spells as a Fianna F√°il TD for Galway, from 1927 to 1932 and 1937 to 1939. His parents had originally moved to Carraroe in Connemara to teach at the local Irish-language school. Tubridy was also involved in Gaeltacht affairs and in the mid-1930s was a co-founder of Muintir na Gaeltachta, along with Peadar Duignan and M√°irt√≠n √ì Cadhain. Early life John Andrew Tubridy was born in 1897 at Galway, County Galway, to Patrick Tubridy (1869‚Äì1920) and Jane Waldron (born 1868). He had only one sibling, Mary Margaret Patricia (born 1903). Se√°n's father was from Kilmurry Ibrickane, County Clare, and his mother from Kilkelly, County Mayo; the two were Gaeilgoir and had moved to the Irish-speaking area of Connemara to teach at the Scoil Mhic Dara in Carraroe. They worked with Roger Casement and helped to set up a fund for free school dinners there. The two had a feud with a priest by the name of Fr. Healy and were attacked from the pulpit, but they received support from local parents. Tubridy was a medical practitioner who fought against the epidemics of cholera, typhus and the Spanish Flu in Connemara. He married a Dublin woman by the name of Kathleen Moira Ryan, daughter of Hugh Ryan, the Professor of Chemistry at University College, Dublin. The youngest of their three children was a son Patrick Tubridy, who married Catherine Andrews, the daughter of Todd Andrews, a prominent former member of the Irish Republican Army. Patrick himself had several children, including the broadcaster Ryan Tubridy.As noted in the September 2009 episode of TV genealogy show Who do you think you are?. D√°il √âireann Tubridy was first elected to D√°il √âireann as a Fianna F√°il Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Galway constituency at the June 1927 general election. He was re-elected at the September 1927 general election but lost his seat at the 1932 general election. He stood unsuccessfully at the 1933 general election but was elected for the Galway West constituency at the 1937 general election. He was re- elected at the 1938 general election, but died during the 10th D√°il in July 1939. The by-election caused by his death was held on 30 May 1940 and was won by John J. Keane of Fianna F√°il.

They provide a means for smoothing noisy x_i, y_i data. The most familiar example is the cubic smoothing spline, but there are many other possibilities, including for the case where x is a vector quantity. Cubic spline definition Let {x_i,Y_i: i = 1,dots,n} be a set of observations, modeled by the relation Y_i = f(x_i) + epsilon_i where the epsilon_i are independent, zero mean random variables (usually assumed to have constant variance). The cubic smoothing spline estimate hat f of the function f is defined to be the minimizer (over the class of twice differentiable functions) of : sum_{i=1}^n {Y_i - hat f(x_i)}^2 + lambda int hat f(x)^2 ,dx. Remarks: * lambda ge 0 is a smoothing parameter, controlling the trade-off between fidelity to the data and roughness of the function estimate. This is often estimated by generalized cross-validation, or by restricted marginal likelihood (REML) which exploits the link between spline smoothing and Bayesian estimation (the smoothing penalty can be viewed as being induced by a prior on the f). * The integral is often evaluated over the whole real line although it is also possible to restrict the range to that of x_i. * As lambdato 0 (no smoothing), the smoothing spline converges to the interpolating spline. * As lambdatoinfty (infinite smoothing), the roughness penalty becomes paramount and the estimate converges to a linear least squares estimate. * The roughness penalty based on the second derivative is the most common in modern statistics literature, although the method can easily be adapted to penalties based on other derivatives. * In early literature, with equally-spaced ordered x_i, second or third-order differences were used in the penalty, rather than derivatives. * The penalized sum of squares smoothing objective can be replaced by a penalized likelihood objective in which the sum of squares terms is replaced by another log-likelihood based measure of fidelity to the data. The sum of squares term corresponds to penalized likelihood with a Gaussian assumption on the epsilon_i. Derivation of the cubic smoothing spline It is useful to think of fitting a smoothing spline in two steps: # First, derive the values hat f(x_i);i=1,ldots,n. # From these values, derive hat f(x) for all x. Now, treat the second step first. Given the vector hat{m} = (hat f(x_1),ldots,hat f(x_n))^T of fitted values, the sum-of-squares part of the spline criterion is fixed. It remains only to minimize int hat f(x)^2 , dx, and the minimizer is a natural cubic spline that interpolates the points (x_i,hat f(x_i)). This interpolating spline is a linear operator, and can be written in the form : hat f(x) = sum_{i=1}^n hat f(x_i) f_i(x) where f_i(x) are a set of spline basis functions. As a result, the roughness penalty has the form : int hat f(x)^2 dx = hat{m}^T A hat{m}. where the elements of A are int f_i(x) f_j(x)dx. The basis functions, and hence the matrix A, depend on the configuration of the predictor variables x_i, but not on the responses Y_i or hat m. A is an n√ón matrix given by A = Delta^T W^{-1} Delta. Œî is an (n-2)√ón matrix of second differences with elements: Delta_{ii} = 1/h_i, Delta_{i,i+1} = -1/h_i - 1/h_{i+1}, Delta_{i,i+2} = 1/h_{i+1} W is an (n-2)√ó(n-2) symmetric tri-diagonal matrix with elements: W_{i-1,i}=W_{i,i-1}=h_i/6, W_{ii}=(h_i+h_{i+1})/3 and h_i=xi_{i+1} - xi_i, the distances between successive knots (or x values). Now back to the first step. The penalized sum-of-squares can be written as : {Y - hat m}^T {Y - hat m} + lambda hat{m}^T A hat m, where Y=(Y_1,ldots,Y_n)^T. Minimizing over hat m by differentiating against hat m. This results in: -2 { Y - hat m } + 2 lambda A hat m = 0 and hat m = (I + lambda A)^{-1} Y. De Boor's approach De Boor's approach exploits the same idea, of finding a balance between having a smooth curve and being close to the given data. psum_{i=1}^n left ( frac{Y_i - hat f left (x_i right )}{delta_i} right )^2+left ( 1-p right )int left ( hat f^{left (m right )}left ( x right ) right )^2 , dx where p is a parameter called smooth factor and belongs to the interval [0,1], and delta_i;i=1,dots,n are the quantities controlling the extent of smoothing (they represent the weight delta_i^{-2} of each point Y_i). In practice, since cubic splines are mostly used, m is usually 2. The solution for m=2 was proposed by Reinsch in 1967. For m=2, when p approaches 1, hat f converges to the \\"natural\\" spline interpolant to the given data. As p approaches 0, hat f converges to a straight line (the smoothest curve). Since finding a suitable value of p is a task of trial and error, a redundant constant S was introduced for convenience. S is used to numerically determine the value of p so that the function hat f meets the following condition: sum_{i=1}^n left ( frac{Y_i - hat f left (x_i right )}{delta_i} right )^2 le S The algorithm described by de Boor starts with p=0 and increases p until the condition is met. If delta_i is an estimation of the standard deviation for Y_i, the constant S is recommended to be chosen in the interval left [ n-sqrt{2n},n+sqrt{2n} right ]. Having S=0 means the solution is the \\"natural\\" spline interpolant. Increasing S means we obtain a smoother curve by getting farther from the given data. Multidimensional splines There are two main classes of method for generalizing from smoothing with respect to a scalar x to smoothing with respect to a vector x. The first approach simply generalizes the spline smoothing penalty to the multidimensional setting. For example, if trying to estimate f(x,z) we might use the Thin plate spline penalty and find the hat f(x,z) minimizing : sum_{i=1}^n {y_i - f(x_i,z_i)}^2 + lambda int left[left(frac{partial^2 f}{partial x^2}right)^2 + 2left(frac{partial^2 f}{partial x partial z}right)^2 + left(frac{partial^2 f}{partial z^2}right)^2 right] textrm{d} x , textrm{d}z. The thin plate spline approach can be generalized to smoothing with respect to more than two dimensions and to other orders of differentiation in the penalty. As the dimension increases there are some restrictions on the smallest order of differential that can be used, but actually Duchon's original paper,J. Duchon, 1976, Splines minimizing rotation invariant semi-norms in Sobolev spaces. pp 85‚Äì100, In: Constructive Theory of Functions of Several Variables, Oberwolfach 1976, W. Schempp and K. Zeller, eds., Lecture Notes in Math., Vol. 571, Springer, Berlin, 1977 gives slightly more complicated penalties that can avoid this restriction. The thin plate splines are isotropic, meaning that if we rotate the x,z co-ordinate system the estimate will not change, but also that we are assuming that the same level of smoothing is appropriate in all directions. This is often considered reasonable when smoothing with respect to spatial location, but in many other cases isotropy is not an appropriate assumption and can lead to sensitivity to apparently arbitrary choices of measurement units. For example, if smoothing with respect to distance and time an isotropic smoother will give different results if distance is measure in metres and time in seconds, to what will occur if we change the units to centimetres and hours. The second class of generalizations to multi-dimensional smoothing deals directly with this scale invariance issue using tensor product spline constructions. Such splines have smoothing penalties with multiple smoothing parameters, which is the price that must be paid for not assuming that the same degree of smoothness is appropriate in all directions. Related methods Smoothing splines are related to, but distinct from: * Regression splines. In this method, the data is fitted to a set of spline basis functions with a reduced set of knots, typically by least squares. No roughness penalty is used. (See also multivariate adaptive regression splines.) * Penalized Splines. This combines the reduced knots of regression splines, with the roughness penalty of smoothing splines. * Elastic maps method for manifold learning.

The church is Grade II listed by the Department for Culture, Media & Sport as it is a building of special architectural or historic interest. History The foundation stone was laid on 8 July 1887 by Henry Smith Wright MP The parish was carved out of that of St Saviours in the Meadows, Nottingham. The nave of the church was consecrated on 12 June 1888 by the Rt. Revd. Dr. Edward Trollope, Bishop of Nottingham, acting for the Bishop of Southwell. The nave was designed by Richard Charles Sutton. Nave and chancel The chancel was consecrated by the Bishop of Derby on 16 April 1898. It was designed by George Frederick Bodley and erected at a cost of ¬£2,000. The Lady Chapel was intended to be built to the designs of Bodley, but Cecil Greenwood Hare designed a larger one which was built between 1914 and 1915. The church is located in the Meadows area of Nottingham. The parish merged with that of St. John the Baptist's Church, Leenside, Nottingham when that church was demolished after damage during the Second World War. Stained glass The church is dominated by the west window containing St Michael and St George, which was designed in 1927 by Burlison and Grylls but not installed until 1938. The north aisle contains six windows each with an English saint, by Horace Turrell Hincks of Hincks and Burnell which were added between 1924 and 1934. The Lady Chapel windows are by Whitefriars and date from 1948 and 1949. Tradition The parish of S George‚Äôs is within the Diocese of Southwell and Nottingham and has adopted resolutions A, B and C and, while taking part in the Christian life of the diocese, is under the spiritual guidance of the Bishop of Beverley. This means that it trusts in the way God has revealed himself through the maleness of Jesus, the apostles and the apostolic succession and would not want to break or damage in any way the validity of the sacraments that come to us by this chain of God, Jesus, Apostle, Bishop, Priest. Organ Organ case of 1906 The organ was built by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd at a cost of ¬£500 and was dedicated on 1 September 1895. It was temporarily housed at the end of the south aisle, but when the chancel was completed, and an organ chamber built in 1905-6, it was moved and the case was designed by George Frederick Bodley.

Crawford Hill is formed as it climbs the Pine Ridge escarpment, formations of buttes and grassy dense sand hills lined with ponderosa pines. Manned helper engines based in Crawford are used to help 18,000-ton () loaded coal trains from Wyoming's Powder River Basin make it up the escarpment. History In 1888, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad began building a line west from Alliance, Nebraska to Edgemont, South Dakota to compete with the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad. The challenge came when conquering the Pine Ridge escarpment. Upon reaching Belmont, engineers determined the only means of success would be constructing the Belmont Tunnel through the east face of the escarpment, with a steep grade and tight curves down into the settlement known as Crawford. In September 1889, the CB&Q; succeeded, establishing a small operations base in Crawford, as well as a connection with the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad. The arrival of the CB&Q; and the creation of a junction between the two railroads provided a significant economic boost to the region, particularly the agricultural and ranching industries. The line also became a vital means of transport for the soldiers, horses, and supplies at the United States Army's outpost at Fort Robinson. In 1907, Crawford became a city, and by 1911, it had the seventh-highest business volume in Nebraska. Through the years Crawford saw many businesses come and go, including a brick works, mica mill, pickle factory, and a Nash Finch Company warehouse. Crawford's population peaked at 2,536 in 1910. All of this was supported by and heavily relied on the railroad. On March 2, 1970, the route became property of Burlington Northern Railroad as the result of a merger that involved four major railroads: the Great Northern Railway, Northern Pacific Railway, Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad as well as a few small jointly owned subsidiaries owned by the four. The newly formed railroad would bring major improvements to the route. In 1992 Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad successor Chicago and North Western determined there was insufficient traffic on their line to continue operations, and abandoned the track, including removing the diamond crossing with Burlington Northern Railroad at Crawford. A portion of the route from Crawford to Chadron would again see life when revived by the regional Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad, which in April 2010 handed over operations to shortline operators Nebraska Northwestern Railroad and Nebkota Railway. As of 2014, both continued interchange of grain and merchandise by boxcar at Crawford. Bringing coal east In the late 1970s, a large low-sulphur coal deposit was discovered in the Niobrara Basin and Powder River Basin near Wright, Wyoming. The Burlington Northern Railroad began building a line south from Edgemont, South Dakota into the newly found coal deposits to provide rail transportation. The coal loads would head east to Chicago and the Atlantic coast via Crawford Hill. With the success of the Powder River Basin coal traffic, it Crawford Hill became a choke point on the railroad. Traffic was nearing capacity. In 1982, Burlington Northern began a major reengineering project of the route to handle the additional traffic. The project included the elimination of the Belmont Tunnel, and the creation of several double- horseshoe curves to ease curve radiuses and reduce the grade. The right of way was also widened, moving millions of tons of earth, whole hill sides in some places, creating huge cuts to allow for a second main track and access road for the whole length of the climb. After the BNSF Railway merger in 1996, the newly formed company began a second round of improvements, upgrading communications and signaling systems. In 1999, concrete cross ties were installed to help support heavier tonnage and reduce maintenance costs. Operations By compass, Crawford Hill is oriented almost directly north and south. Trains towards Crawford and Edgemont are considered westbound, while trains towards Alliance, Nebraska are considered eastbound. Loaded coal trains operate eastbound over the line, while empties travel back west. Coal trans vary from 125 to 140 cars, and can weigh up to 19,500 tons (). Most trains over Crawford Hill operate with 2-3 locomotives on the head-end and 1-2 DPU remote locomotives on the rear. Even with up to 5 locomotives assigned to a train, the hill is still too steep and requires sets of manned helper locomotives to reach the summit. Helpers are generally placed on trains at Moody Road in Crawford, and are cut away at the top of the grade at Belmont. Particularly heavy or under-powered trains will sometimes continue with their helpers to Nonphereil. In recent years, coal loading in the Powder River Basin has reached an all-time high. In 2012, it was discovered that the same shale formations that yielded coal also contained substantial reserves of oil. By the spring of 2013, numerous companies had entered the region of Wyoming to extract the fuel by means of the controversial hydraulic fracturing, or \\"fracking\\", method. Much of the oil is loaded into tank cars, some of which are transported east over Crawford Hill. Merchandise trains from Kansas City, Kansas to the Pacific Northwest also use the route, including movements of Boeing 737 and Boeing 787 aircraft fuselages to Boeing's final assembly plant in Seattle, Washington. Train movements are controlled by the Alliance West Dispatcher in Fort Worth, Texas with a form of Advanced Train Control System known as ARES. Signals are spaced from apart on the double track route and allow for bidirectional running. Trains operate on a frequency of 161.10000 MHz (AAR Channel 87). Accessing the hill Access to the steepest part of Crawford Hill itself is minimal. The majority of viewing locations are entirely on private property, most of which is working ranch land. The land is protected by gates, fences, and regular patrol by ranch hands.

Several subspecies are found in the Holarctic ecozone south to Anatolia, Transcaucasus, northern Iran, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, China, Korea and Japan. One subspecies is endemic to North America. P. plantaginis males occur predominantly in two distinct color phenotypes: yellow and white. They are aposematic, meaning their colorations serve to deter predators from attacking. In populations of aposematic species, it is common to have a single coloration phenotype dominate, because predators better learn to avoid the more common phenotype and rare phenotypes suffer higher predation. Rare phenotypes are often selected against because predators are less familiar with their aposematic signal. Thus, other selective pressures exist to perpetuate weaker aposematic signals in exchange for other adaptive benefits. P. plantaginis has become a common model for studying the counteracting selective pressures of predation, mate choice, immune function, thermoregulation, and more. Figures 3-7, wood tiger moth forms Description This moth is extraordinarily variable. The wingspan is 32‚Äì38 mm. Normally, it has a black forewing in both sexes, with moderately broad, ivory yellow bands. In the male, the hindwing is yellow or white with an irregular marginal band, which is often interrupted, and two or three submarginal spots. The basal portion of the hindwing bears black streaks at the margin of the cell and before the anal margin. In the female, the hindwing is red above with the base strongly black. Numerous aberrations have been found and named, which often occur predominantly, and only exceptionally among typical specimens. Major aberrations are listed by Seitz, 1913.Adalbert Seitz in Seitz, A. Ed. Die Gro√üschmetterlinge der Erde, Verlag Alfred Kernen, Stuttgart Band 2: Abt. 1, Die Gro√üschmetterlinge des palaearktischen Faunengebietes, Die palaearktischen Spinner und Schw√§rmer, 1912- 1913 Volume 2 (page 81) online In English translation  Geographic range  There are populations throughout the globe, but most common in northern latitudes of North America and Eurasia. The North American populations range from Alaska to Manitoba, and south through the Rocky Mountain region to southern New Mexico, with isolated populations occurring in Arizona and the Sierra Nevada mountains of California and Nevada.  Habitat  P. plantaginis prefer slightly moist areas, like meadows with nearby streams. Adults like to spend time close to lupine stands, which are meadows of plants from the genus Lupinus. It is estimated that over 250 annual and perennial species of this genus Lupinus are distributed throughout both montane and lowland habitats, with hugely diverse regions found in North and South America.  Home range and territoriality   Genetic population structure  A two-year study of populations of P. plantaginis throughout the Alpine regions of Italy, Austria and Switzerland indicated a single whole population. Pairwise Fst values, AMOVA and COl results showed little to no differentiation between populations during the two sampling years of 2009 and 2010. This overall high genetic diversity and low differentiation between populations suggests much gene flow and high population density in P. plantaginis populations. Though this extreme gene flow would be thought to lead to fixation of a single morphological phenotype, the differential selective pressures experienced by various populations of the species likely leads to the maintenance of its widespread polymorphism.  Food resources  Wood tiger moths are polyphagous, meaning their diet can vary significantly. Eating different host plants can result in different immune function and overall life history traits; one example of this is shown by wood tiger moth caterpillars that feed on ribwort plantain. These plant contain high levels of iridoid glycosides, which help caterpillars produce defensive chemicals. A 2015 study showed that the iridoid glycosides present in plantain-eating larvae is sufficient to deter both ants and parasitoids.  Caterpillars  Though it may benefit caterpillars to intake more plant compounds that can help produce defensive chemicals (depending on the plant), this process can be costly and energy intensive for caterpillars. As polyphagous larvae, this process of detoxification and toxin sequestration can be especially costly if their physiology has to support detoxification processes for different types of plants and compounds. Investing more in detoxification as larvae results in lower reproductive output as adults. Lupine, a common host plant for Parasemia plantaginis  Adults  P. plantaginis are capital breeders, which means that they do not feed as adults, and thus the larval diet is incredibly important component in adult fitness. Wood tiger adult  Life history  Males are, on average, smaller than females but experience a relatively similar rate of development. Generally a longer development time correlates with a larger pupal mass, and in females, pupal mass correlates with total lifetime eggs produced. As a polyphagous species, the life history traits of P. plantaginis depend on its habitat and diet. In P. plantaginis, high anti- oxidant intake from their diet significantly increases their ability to encapsulate pathogens. Encapsulation is an important, innate immune response that occurs in invertebrates to protect against a variety of parasites and pathogens. The antioxidants serve to protect cells from damage incurred by the creation of free radicals resulting from the encapsulation reaction. In environments where the pathogen load is likely to be high, the food ingested by an individual moth is important in building its defense mechanisms.  Enemies  Birds and ants are the most common predators of P. plantaginis, to which the moth has both general and specialized defense mechanisms. The blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) is a well known predator. Selection by predation can impact host immune defense, as demonstrated by an experiment measuring the virulence of a pathogen Serrate marcescens in Parasemia plantaginis larvae. Larvae with smaller warning signals had higher survival rates than those with larger warning signals, suggesting that developing a warning signal comes at the expense of immune function. Basically, there is a trade off between immune function and predatory defense. Thus predation is an import factor when considering the evolution of pathogen virulence and host immunity.  Protective coloration and behavior   Aposematism  Aposematism is common in many Lepidoptera species; it is an adaptive mechanism in which prey produce conspicuous warning signals. In the wood tiger moth, conspicuous coloration patterns communicate a poisonous, toxic, or otherwise unpalatable or unprofitable effect to predators. Typically, aposematic species experience strong selection favoring monomorphic populations. As a specific warning signal phenotype becomes more common in an environment, more and more predators learn to avoid individuals bearing such signals. In P. plantaginis, a distinct hindwing pattern of bands and splotches of white or yellow on black warns predators of its chemical defenses. Populations of P. plantaginis, are, however, almost always polymorphic, with males exhibiting varying degrees of either yellow or white melanized banding patterns. Yellow morphs show stronger warning signals and experience lower predation rates and longer predator- hesitation. White morphs are preyed upon significantly more by birds than yellow morphs, but persist as a frequent phenotype in many populations, suggesting there are other selection pressures favoring white morphs. A possible explanation for the persistence of white morphs despite their higher predation rates is selection heterogeneity; in other words, due to the wide geographic distribution of the wood tiger moth, different populations experience vastly different selective pressures. One consideration is immune variation. A 2013 study demonstrated that male yellow and white larvae saw different survival rates when reared in aggregations; yellow male survived to pupate better in aggregations than white males did, which may reflect different immune investments. In aggregations, white males saw better ability to encapsulate pathogens, while yellow males had higher hemolymph (equivalent to insect 'blood') lytic activity (virus attacking). Thus the two types of wood tiger moth may be maintained in populations because they have different immune investments. This is advantageous in thriving in heterogeneous environments with differential risk factors for immune challenges.  Feigning death  Though the aposematic signal of a wood tiger moth is highly conspicuous against vegetative scenery, its patterning is less easy to detect when it drops to the ground. Disruptive coloration is when a pattern creates an illusion that makes discerning the edges of an object difficult. It essentially destroys the appearance of any outline the object may have. Though the idea of disruptive coloration, which is clearly a camouflage technique, seems counterintuitive in aposematism, it has been demonstrated that the same coloration pattern on a moth can act as either a warning signal or a camouflage depending on the backdrop. Wood tiger moths exhibit a behavior where they essentially 'feign death' by dropping suddenly on to the ground in the presence of a predator and taking on a specific, rigid posture with folded legs. Once on the ground, the moths are much more difficult to detect. This suggests that the hindwing pattern of the wood tiger moth can switch instantly from conspicuous to camouflage, which has obvious adaptive advantages.  Target specific chemical defense mechanisms  A 2017 study highlighted the ability of P. plantaginis to secrete two different chemical fluids as defense mechanisms in response to two different types of predators. Along with its colorful, conspicuous hindwing color patterns, these moths secrete defense fluids from their abdomen and thoracic glands. The abdominal fluids deterred ants and not birds, while thoracic fluids deterred birds but not ants, suggesting that a single species is capable of producing target-specific chemical defense fluids in response to predation threats.

The shapes and patterning of adult warning signals are entirely determined during resource allocation of the larval stage. Once an adult metamorphoses, their warning signal phenotype can no longer change.  Mating  Yellow morphs are able to avoid predation more readily than white morphs; however, a laboratory study showed that yellow males had lower mating success compared to white males. This trade-off between reproductive success and predator avoidance could explain why two polymorphisms exist. Females tend to attract males during the day, and they group together at dusk. It has been observed that once attracted to a group of females, male P. plantaginis will readily mate with females of a related species Arctica villa, most likely due to their similar sex pheromones. Similarly, female P. plantaginis are also attracted to male Artica villas.  Physiology   Flight  Flight behavior in populations of P. plantaginis vary between color morphs and are under frequency dependent selection. In outdoor cage experiments of populations with various frequencies of yellow and white male morphs, researches found that white morphs were significantly more active and had longer periods of sustained activity than yellow morphs across all treatment groups. In groups with higher frequencies of yellow morphs, overall flying activity for both morphs was considerably lower. The data suggest that white male morphs invest less in producing costly warning signals and thus have more energy to invest in flight for both avoiding predation and finding mates. Yellow males, which in previous studies have been shown to be less sexually favored by females than whites, tend to be most active at peak female-calling periods.  Thermoregulation  Wood tiger moths have a limited amount of resources to allocate to different life history traits and adaptive strategies; thermoregulation is an important part of their physiology, especially in the cooler climates of North America and Eurasia. As latitude increases, populations of P. plantaginis show higher melanization (conversion of resources into melanin). This melanin confers thermoregulatory advantages by increasing a male moth's ability to absorb radiation. This increased melanization comes at a cost, however, as it is costly to produce, and thus male moths with more melanization suffer increased predation as their warning signals are weaker. Thus it is thought that due to the various climactic conditions of populations of wood tiger moth, there are different costs and benefits to produces more melanin, which serves to maintain the global diversity of warning signals that we see throughout the species. In both yellow and white male phenotypes, individuals with more melanin had a heightened ability to trap heat but an increased predation rate due to its weaker and less effective signal.

In 2015, the Times of Israel published an article, with an estimate of up to 10,000 Armenians living across Israel. History 4th-18th century A significant minority of the Armenian community has been resident in the Levant for centuries. The first recorded Armenian pilgrimage to the Holy Land was an Armenian delegation of priests in the early 4th century AD. The visit is alluded to in an Armenian translation of a Greek letter written by Patriarch Macarius of Jerusalem to his contemporary, St. Vrtanes (ruled 333‚Äì341). The Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem was founded in 638. It is located in the Armenian Quarter, the smallest quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem. Ottoman and British periods =Photographers= Starting in the 1850s Armenians became dominant among Palestine's photographers. The central figure in this development was the leading cleric Esayee Garabedian, who were to become Armenian Patriarch of Jerusalem in 1864-65, and who started photographing in 1857Luminous-Lint. Photography: History, Evolution and Analysis and established a photography workshop within the St. James monastic compound. There he set up a school for photography, Garabed Krikorian (1847-1920) and his brother Kevork counting among his students. Other 19th-century Armenian photographers from Jerusalem are J. H. Halladjian, M. Mardikian and Yusuf Toumaian. After the Armenian Genocide other photographers joined them, including Hrnat Nakashian and Elia Kahvedjian. Garabed Krikorian opened a photography workshop on Jaffa Road in the 1870s and became himself a teacher, one of his students being Khalil Raad, known as \\"Palestine's first Arab photographer\\". Elia Kahvedjian (1910-1999), a refugee of the Armenian genocide, was one of the leading photographers in Jerusalem at the beginning of the 20th century.The finest photographs of early 20th century Palestine, shuttered in controversy, Haaretz =Ceramicists= :Further information: Armenian tile makers and potters in Israel Many Armenians from K√ºtahya, a city in Turkey, were known for their hand-painted ceramic wares and tiles. In 1919, several master craftsmen were brought to Jerusalem to renovate the tiles covering the facade of the Dome of the Rock. They remained in Jerusalem and developed the art of Armenian ceramics.Armenian Pottery and the Karakashians Israeli period =1948-1967= After the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War and the establishment of the State of Israel, a number of Armenians residing in what had been the British Mandate of Palestine took up Israeli citizenship, whereas other Armenian residents of Old City of Jerusalem and the territory captured by Jordan received Jordanian nationality.. Two groups of Armenians emerged: Armenians with Israeli citizenship living within the borders of the state and Armenians with Jordanian nationality in Jerusalem's Armenian Quarter and the rest of Jordanian West Bank. =After 1967= After the 1967 Six-Day War, the Armenian population, especially in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, experienced a decrease in its numbers because of emigration. Armenians of Jerusalem were provided with Israeli resident status and some applied for citizenship. In 1983, tensions arose within the Armenian Quarter of Jerusalem, when Patriarch Yeshighe Derderian replaced Archbishop Shahe Ajamian. Violence erupted in June 1986, when a group of Armenian Patriarch Derderian's supporters attacked another Armenian family, which was well known for its anti-Patriarch views and as a result one man was killed and six others were injured in a street battle that church representatives dubbed \\"a fight between two families.\\" Demographics In 1986, it was estimated that 1,500 Armenians lived in the city of Jerusalem. According to a 2006 survey, 790 Armenians lived in Jerusalem's Old City. In 2015, the Times of Israel published an article, with an estimate of up to 10,000 Armenians living across Israel. There are a few Russian-speaking Jews from Armenia in Israel, but they are classified within the former USSR Aliyah, so no precise statistics are available prior to 1991 when Armenia restored its independence from the USSR. Religion The overwhelming majority of Armenians in Israel are Armenian Orthodox Christians, but there are also a small number of Armenian Catholics and Armenian Evangelicals. The Armenian Orthodox remain under the jurisdiction of the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem and the residing Patriarch, in spiritual connection with the Armenian Apostolic Church (See of Holy Etchmiadzin), whereas the Armenian Catholics are under the jurisdiction of the Armenian Catholic Church and Patriarchal Vicar (residing at Via Dolorosa 41 - Fourth Station). The Churches belonging to the Armenian Apostolic Church are among others St. Elias Church in Haifa and Saint Nicholas Church and Monastery in Jaffa. Armenian-Israelis also pray in St. James Cathedral (Surpotz Hagopyants) at the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem, at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem (under joint jurisdiction of Armenian Church with other Christian churches), the Tomb of Virgin Mary and Gethsemane, the Chapel of the Ascension on Mount of Olives, the Church of St. Gregory the Enlightener in modern Jerusalem, and the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem (again under joint jurisdiction of the Armenian Church and other Christian churches). The Armenian Church also has the St. George Monastery in Ramleh. Armenians in Israel and the West Bank celebrate Christmas and the Epiphany on the same day, which is traditionally on January 19, while Armenian Orthodox communities in Armenia and worldwide celebrate on January 6. This is because the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem still abides by the ancient Julian calendar, whereas the Armenian Apostolic Church has adopted the Gregorian calendar. Armenian Catholics, Evangelical and Brethren churches in Israel celebrate Christmas on December 25, in line with all other Catholics of the Roman Catholic Church as well as other fellow Protestants. Language and culture The Institute of African and Asian Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem established a chair of Armenian Studies program, specialising in study of Armenian language, literature, history and culture as well as the Armenian Genocide. Armenia‚ÄìIsrael relations Armenia maintains diplomatic relations with Israel. According to the CIA World Factbook, Armenia receives 4.8% of its imports from Israel, while Israel receives 7.1% of Armenia's exports.CIA World Factbook: Armenia Although both countries have diplomatic relations, neither maintains an embassy in the other country. Instead, Ambassador Ehud Moshe Eytam, the Israeli ambassador to Armenia is based in Tbilisi, Georgia, and visits Yerevan twice a month. In Jerusalem Tsolag Momjian is the honorary consul. Since Armenia's independence, Israeli politicians, rabbis, and the country's Armenian community have called on the Israeli government to recognize the Armenian Genocide. At the same time, Turkey has threatened to break off ties with Israel if Israel or the United States recognized the killings as genocide. As of 2008, there has been an ongoing debate regarding recognition in the Knesset with Turkey lobbying hard to prevent it. According to The Jerusalem Post, many Israelis support recognition.

The Deutsche Reichsbahn took over all eleven engines, classifying them as DRG Class 13.18 and allocating them numbers 13 1851 to 13 1861. They were retired by 1927.

Seddon, The Times, 1 June 1939 Originally a member of the Labour Party, he subsequently moved to the National Democratic and Labour Party. Seddon was born in Prescot, Lancashire in 1868. Having served an apprenticeship as a grocer, he spent ten years working as a commercial traveller.Biographies of New Members, The Times, 17 February 1906, p.14 He subsequently became the delegate of the St Helens branch of the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks. He was elected as vice-president and then president of the union in 1901 and 1902.National Union of Shop Assistants, The Times, 9 April 1901, p.5 In 1906 he was elected Labour MP for Newton, Lancashire. He held the seat at the subsequent general election in January, 1910, but was defeated by 144 votes in the December 1910 poll.Last Night's Returns - The Unionist Gains, The Times, 8 December 1910, p.10 Seddon continued his work with the union movement, was reselected as Labour candidate for Newton and elected a member of the parliamentary committee of the Trades Union Congress in 1911.Trades Union Congress, The Times, 11 September 1911, p.5 In 1915 he was elected President of the TUC. In 1915 Seddon became a founding member of the Socialist National Defence Committee. The SNDC was short-lived, becoming part of the British Workers League in 1916. In 1917 he resigned from the Labour Party, citing a \\"change of view\\" caused by the First World War.Labour Candidate's Change of View, The Times, 27 March 1917, p.5 In late spring 1918 the British Worker's League resolved to become a parliamentary party. The National Democratic and Labour Party (British Workers League) or NDP was duly formed as a \\"patriotic working-class party\\". At the 1918 general election Seddon successfully contested the Hanley constituency for the NDP, becoming one of the new party's nine MPs. He had the support of the coalition government, and therefore did not face opposition from either the Conservative or Liberal Parties. He was vice-chairman of the party in the Commons from 1918, before becoming chairman in 1920. he was made a Companion of Honour in 1918. Seddon's parliamentary career came to an end in 1922: along with the other NDP MPs he lost his seat at the October general election, despite campaigning as a \\"National Liberal\\". He later joined the Conservative Party. Seddon continued his interest in politics outside of parliament. In 1925 he helped found the Steel House Constructors Union, claiming a programme of building steel houses could employ 150,000 men.Case for Dilution in Building Industry, the Times, 26 March 1925, p.18 He became a member of the Industrial Peace Union of the British Empire formed after the General Strike of 1926.Industrial Peace Union, The Times, 9 February 1928, p.2 J.

Typically a stimulus made up of two parallel lines differing in length and joined at the tops by a cross bar is presented (similar to the Greek letter Pi). The ability to quickly detect the identity of a stimulus is moderately heritable and correlates with the subject's IQ. Overview If asked which of the two lines in the figure below is longer; the left or the right, almost all non-visually impaired subjects can answer correctly 100% of the time. If, however, the stimulus is backward masked after a short period of time, the proportion of correct responses declines as the exposure duration reduces, and reliable individual differences emerge in the percent identified correctly at different intervals. The task itself was proposed by Doug Vickers as a measure of the rate of accumulation of information. Ted Nettelbeck, Chris Brand and others demonstrated it related quite strongly to psychometric intelligence, especially across the lower part of the IQ range suggesting that differences in intelligence may reflect, in part, differences in the rate of information processing - a theory proposed by Arthur Jensen. One version of the inspection time stimuli is shown below (1) with the stimulus (short left given as an example), which is replaced by a mask (2). (3) indicates the opportunity for the subject to report which stimulus they saw at their leisure. image:Illustration of inspection time stimulus.png Genetics Inspection time is moderately heritable; this work on the heritability of IT from Nick Martin's group also demonstrated, however, that perceptual speed does not have a causal role in intelligence, but rather that IQ and IT are distinct reflections of some shared biological processes.

In Imperial Rome, the charge of onolatry was used by the pagans to taunt the Jews and first Christians. The association of Jews with donkeys was a common feature of Hellenic as well as Latin ethnographic and historical writings, and included accusations of worshipping a golden donkey head and even sacrificing foreigners to it at intervals. A famous example of this is the Alexamenos graffito. The charge was likely first used against Jews in Egypt, where donkeys were at some points associated with Set, the murderer of Osiris who is in turn destroyed by Isis. It is first attested in the late first century BCE, and was used against Christians extensively in the first and second centuries CE before disappearing almost entirely in the third. The accusation against the Christians is discussed by Tertullian and Minucius Felix, among other early Christian apologists. Arthur Bernard Cook, in an 1894 article, argued that there had been an ancient Mycenaean cult practicing onolatry, citing a fresco depicting donkey-headed figures found near a sacrificial pit and several carved gems apparently showing people wearing donkeys' heads and skins holding sacrificial objects, and further describing the diverse roles asses played in Ancient Greek mythology. His interpretation was challenged at the time by Andrew Lang in Longman's Magazine.

These are alternatives to the traditional stock exchanges where a market is made in securities, typically using electronic systems. The concept was introduced within the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), a European Directive designed to harmonise retail investors protection and allow investment firms to provide services throughout the EU. Article 4 (15) of MiFID describes MTF as multilateral system, operated by an investment firm or a market operator, which brings together multiple third-party buying and selling interests in financial instruments ‚Äì in the system and in accordance with non-discretionary rules ‚Äì in a way that results in a contract. The term 'non-discretionary rules' means that the investment firm operating an MTF has no discretion as to how interests may interact. Interests are brought together by forming a contract and the execution takes place under the system's rules or by means of the system's protocols or internal operating procedures. The MTF can be operated by a market operator or an investment firm whereas the operation of a regulated market is not considered an investment service and is carried out exclusively by market operators that are authorised to do so. The United States equivalent is an alternative trading system. History Before the introduction of MiFID trading in stocks and shares was typically centred on large national stock exchanges, such as London Stock Exchange (LSE), Deutsche B√∂rse and Euronext. The rules for operating exchanges varied from country to country, with some exchanges granted exclusivity over certain services for that country's market. Consequently, European share trading tended to be conducted on one specific venue, like the Euronext Paris market for French securities or the LSE for United Kingdom securities. MiFID II classified three types of trading venue: * A regulated market (RM) run by a market operator * A multilateral trading facility (MTF) * An organised trading facility (OTF) Permission to run any of the three types of service was required from an appropriate regulator, with the existing exchanges registering as regulated markets. Compared to \\"regulated markets\\" MTFs are a kind of \\"exchange lite\\" because they provide similar or competing trading services and have similar structures, like rulebooks and market surveillance departments. Market operators are also arbiters for securities. Companies wishing to list upon a regulated market undergo a listing process and pay fees; this allows the operator to ensure that only appropriate securities are available for trading. This may involve requirements about the number of shares that are available, standards around how the accounts of the company are maintained or strict rules about how news is released to the market. Whether or not a security has been \\"admitted to trading on a regulated market\\" is a key concept within MiFID, and is fundamental in how the rules apply to trading in the security. MTFs do not have a standard listing process and cannot change the regulatory status of a security. Operating rules MiFID lays out a number of obligations for an MTF to operate: * It must be pre-trade transparent, the price of existing orders must be made available on market data feeds. ** An MTF may be exempted from pre-trade transparency via use of an appropriate waiver, such as a large in size waiver or price referencing waiver - in this case the MTF will be a dark pool. * It must be post-trade transparent, any trades carried out on the platform must be published in real-time. * Prices and charges must be public and applied consistently across all members. * There must be a rulebook advising how the system works and a means for applying for membership. Impact on European trading New entrant MTFs have had a considerable impact on European share-trading. MiFID enabled trading venues to compete with one another. The legacy exchanges largely chose to keep to their existing business models and scope, but new entrant MTFs have made a significant impact. Chi-X Europe, the largest MTF by volume, is also the largest trading venue in Europe according to some statistics. MTFs have been launched in other asset classes as well, one of the examples is LMAX Exchange an FCA regulated MTF for trading spot FX and precious metals. This is part of a process known as fragmentation, where liquidity for one security is no- longer concentrated on one exchange but across multiple venues. This in turn forced traders to make use of more sophisticated trading strategies such as smart order routing. Impact on fees The new MTFs were notable for: * High trading speeds, using technology to make their platforms attractive to high frequency traders; * Low cost bases, running their organisations with minimal headcount; * Maker/taker pricing, paying members to trade on the platform as long as the trading adds liquidity rather than takes it; * Trading incentives, often called jump-balls, in which stakes are given to trading members in return for volume traded. These all made the new venues highly attractive and to take market share. In turn, existing venues were forced to discount heavily, significantly impacting revenues. Limited individual success Although they have forced significant adjustments within the equity trading markets, the MTFs themselves have had limited success. Chi-X Europe claims to be profitable, however Nasdaq OMX Europe was shut down in 2010 and Turquoise was bought by the LSE. Many consider the MTF business model unsustainable, although Alisdair Haynes, the Chi-X Europe CEO, said \\"We are not going to raise prices, though most people expect we have to\\". Investment bank MTFs Most investment banks run an internal crossing system. These systems cross clients' orders against one another, or fill the orders directly off the bank's book. Nomura has converted its internal crossing system, NX, into an MTF. Nomura said its decision was for \\"commercial purposes\\". UBS has established UBS MTF, this works in conjunction with its crossing system, UBS PIN. Goldman Sachs has also announced that it will launch an MTF. The exact regulatory status of broker crossing systems is a matter of debate and controversy. It is expected to be an area of future regulatory intervention.

She was the leader of one of the groups that originally formed the French Women's Liberation (MLF), and she later registered the trademark MLF specifically under her name. She helped found the \\"√âditions des femmes\\" (Women's Editions) as well as the first collection of audio-books in France, \\"Biblioth√®que des voix\\" (Library of voices). Her position in feminist theory was primarily essentialist, and heavily based in psychoanalysis. Life Antoinette Fouque was born in a poor neighbourhood of Marseille to Alexis Grugnardi, a Corsican syndicalist. Her mother, of Italian origin, emigrated from Calabria to France for economic reasons and settled in a popular district of Marseille. Early in life, Fouque listened to the speeches of communist leader Maurice Thorez. She became a teacher, married Ren√© Fouque, and developed an interest in Latin culture and Italian literature. With Ren√© Fouque, Antoinette Fouque participated in the literary journal Cahiers du Sud. She gave birth to a daughter, Vincente, in 1964. This event helped make her realize the difficulties that women face when they are mothers and married, especially in an intellectual environment. Between 1965 and 1969, she read Italian manuscripts for √âditions du Seuil. Fouque read Jacques Lacan before reading Sigmund Freud. After marrying Ren√© Fouque, Antoinette Fouque moved to Paris to study literature at the Sorbonne. In the 1960s, she enrolled at the EPHE for a thesis on literary avant-gardes, which she abandoned preferring her activism alongside women, but passed a \\"DEA with Roland Barthes\\". It was during a seminar of Barthes, in January 1968, that she met Monique Wittig. Appalled by the sexism surrounding the intellectual and activist environments at the time of May 1968,Madeleine Chapsal in Le D√©bat : ¬´ Mat√©riaux pour servir √† l'histoire intellectuelle de la France ¬ª, Gallimard, 1988Fran√ßoise Barret- Ducrocq, Femmes en t√™te, Flammarion, 1997. Fouque became active with Wittig and Josiane Chanel in one of the early women's groups which gathered together in 1970 to form the French Mouvement de Lib√©ration des Femmes (MLF), a movement consisting of multiple groups throughout France without any formal leadership.Fran√ßoise Picq, Lib√©ration des Femmes, les ann√©es-mouvement, √©d.Seuil, Paris 1993. Fouque herself denied being feminist, and rejected Simone de Beauvoir's existentialism in favour of structuralism and libertarian Marxism. Her group was called Psychanalyse et Politique. Conflicts developed within the movement between Fouque and Wittig, since the former was influenced by Lacan and the latter by Herbert Marcuse. In April 1971, Antoinette Fouque signed the Manifesto of the 343 for the right of abortion.¬´ La liste des 343 Fran√ßaises qui ont le courage de signer le manifeste \\"Je me suis fait avorter\\" ¬ª, le Nouvel Observateur , 5 April 1971, couverture In 1974, she helped found \\"√âditions des femmes\\", funded by Sylvina Boissonnas, \\"an heiress of the Schlumberger family\\", which printed works for the feminist movement. In October 1979, she registered the name MLF as the property of her group,Claire Duchen, Feminism in France, From May 68 to Mitterrand, Routledge and Kegan Paul, London, 1986 creating controversy. Beauvoir wrote against this appropriation of the MLF by one group.Chroniques d'une imposture, du MLF √† une marque commerciale, Introduction by Simone de Beauvoir, Voix Off, Paris, 1981.  Psychoanalytic training and views  Antoinette Fouque practiced as a psychoanalyst starting in 1971,Interview with Antoinette Fouque, A Voix Nue, France-Culture, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 January 2013 but her credentials were not clearly established. Between 1969 and 1975, Fouque underwent psychoanalysis with Lacan; she said that this helped her \\"not to yield to the feminist illusion. He made me avoid the idea that a woman can only be a failed man. He allowed me to criticize Sartre and Beauvoir.\\" During that same period, Fouque also underwent psychoanalysis with Luce Irigaray. In 1974, Fouque met Serge Leclaire and discussed undergoing analysis with him, but the analysis did not take place. Leclaire became a friend of Fouque, and worked with her group Psychanalyse et Politique. Between 1978 and 1982, Fouque underwent psychoanalysis with Bela Grunberger. Fouque stated that she found Grunberger misogynistic. In 1977, Serge Leclaire, who considers that the MLF movement led by Antoinette Fouque, Psychoanalysis and Politics, revives the psychoanalytic movement by introducing \\"the body and otherness\\", proposed to Lacan to hold a seminar within the framework of the Freudian School of Paris with Antoinette Fouque, but Lacan refused to do this.Fran√ßois Dosse, History of Structuralism: The Sign Sets, 1967 - Present, U of Minnesota Press, 1997, Antoinette Fouque proposed the existence of a specifically feminine libido \\"located at a post- phallic genital stage\\", of oral-genital type: a \\"uterine libido\\" or \\"female libido\\".Alain Touraine, Charles Juliet et Roger Dadoun (√©diteurs), Penser avec Antoinette Fouque, √©ditions Des femmes, 2008, Fouque believed that, at the root of misogyny, there is the primordial envy of the procreative capacity of women, which she calls \\"the envy of the uterus\\", more powerful than the \\"penis envy\\" conceptualized by Freud about girls. According to the psychoanalyst Martine M√©n√®s, Lacan was interested in the debates of the MLF but rejected Fouque's notion of libido. Antoinette Fouque opposed the idea that women are unfinished men which she considered to be the source of misogyny, inducing \\"in all fields, the real and symbolic violence inflicted to women\\".Antoinette Fouque, Il y a deux sexes : essai de f√©minologie, √©ditions Gallimard, 2004, pr√©face de la seconde √©dition, p. XVII In addition, she maintained that the production of living things was \\"a fundamental contribution of women to humanity\\".  Publishing  Reader of the Seuil publishing house,¬´ √Ä voix nue ¬ª France Culture, aired 2013-01-07 she became herself a publisher by creating Editions des femmes, the first women's publishing house in Europe, in 1972. Her commitments for the liberation of women led her to carry out numerous activities in the field of publishing.Jocelyne Sauvard : Antoinette Fouque, portrait et entretien, Sitartmag, septembre 2007 Considering that the French intellectual environment is very macho and that women are underrepresented, especially among writers, and considering women as a \\"people without writing\\", she works to open the world of books and writing to women. From the start, this publishing house has a twofold perspective: political commitment and literary commitment. Its aim is to promote literature but also more generally the struggles of women. Bookstores of the same name open in Paris (1974), Marseille (1976) and Lyon (1977). She creates the first collection of audio books in France \\"La Biblioth√®que des voix\\" (1980). She is also involved in newspapers, Le Quotidien des femmes (from 1974 to June 1976) and Des femmes en mouvement, a monthly magazine (13 issues from December 1977 to January 1979) and then weekly (from 1979 to 1982).  Research and organizations  She created various organizations such as the Women's Science Research Institute in 1980, the College of Women's Studies in 1978, the Women's Alliance for Democracy (AFD) and the Misogyny Observatory in 1989, as well as the Parity Club 2000 in 1990. The bookshop activities were reborn with an \\"Espace des femmes\\" center dedicated to the creations of women, with a gallery and the organization of meetings and debates in Paris. A doctor of political science, Antoinette Fouque was director of research at Paris 8 University from 1994, and a member of the Observatory of Gender Equality from 2002.  Political career  Antoinette Fouque ran for the European elections of 1994 on the list √ânergie radicale (Radical Energy) led by Bernard Tapie. A radical left-wing member of the European Parliament from 1994 to 1999, she joined the PES Group and sits on the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Civil Liberties and Women's Rights (Vice-President) In 2007, she called for a vote for S√©gol√®ne Royal, in a text published in Le Nouvel Observateur, \\"against a right wing of arrogance\\", for \\"a left of hope\\".¬´ Avant qu'il ne soit trop tard ¬ª, tempsreel.nouvelobs.com, 13 March 2007  Death  Antoinette Fouque died on 20 February 2014 in Paris, and right-wing and left-wing politicians paid her homage.AFP, \\"Mort d'Antoinette Fouque, pionni√®re du mouvement f√©ministe\\", Le Monde, 21 February 2014 On 26 February, she was buried in the cemetery of Montparnasse, in the presence of many people including politicians and performers.AFP, \\"Antoinette Fouque, cofondatrice du MLF, inhum√©e √† Paris\\", BFMTV, 26 February 2014  See also  * Feminism in France  Further reading  Claire Duchen, Feminism in France: From May '68 to Mitterrand (London: Routledge, 1996).

It is very like Eilema morosinum (Herrich-Sch√§ffer, [1847]) but the forewing not so elongate, and the angles not so accentuated, the costal streak broader and brighter yellow, the hindwing duller, not so transparent; the apex of the abdomen brighter yellow. On the underside the disc is very blackish iron grey, and contrasts vividly with the orange-yellow costa and the broad pale yellow marginal area. Hindwing beneath pale yellow, the costa deeper yellow; below costa a grey streak from the base.Seitz, E. in Seitz, A. Ed.

Larva blackish dorsally, with narrow lighter lines; subdorsal lines composed of small reddish yellow and white spots; lateral line interrupted, reddish yellow. The larvae feed on lichen and mosses, but also leaves of low growing plants on occasion. References External links Taxonomy *Eilema complana at Lepiforum e.V.

The home button is depicted in the lower center of the array. Participants are told to move their finger from the home button to one of eight additional response buttons when specific LED lights illuminate. This produces several measures of participant response time (RT). The Jensen box was developed by University of California, Berkeley psychologist Arthur Jensen as an experimental apparatus for measuring choice reaction time (RT) and individual differences in intelligence.A. R. Jensen. (1987). Individual differences in the Hick paradigm. In Speed of information- processing and intelligence. P. A. Vernon and et al., Norwood, NJ, USA, Ablex Publishing Corp, 101-175.  Design and measurement  The standard Jensen box is approximately 12 by 20 inches in size with a sloping face. Eight buttons are arrayed in a semicircle with a 'home' key in the lower center. Above each response button is a small LED light. Following an auditory warning tone and a delay, one of the lights is illuminated and the participant releases their finger from the home button. Participants then move to initiate a button press at the illuminated location as quickly as possible. RT is measured in two different ways: the time elapsed between the light signal and the home button release, and the time between the home button release and the target button press. These separate measures were initially conceptualized as assessing \\"decision time\\" and \\"movement time,\\" respectively. However, participants can shift decision time into the movement phase by releasing the home button while the decision-making is still incomplete. Masking the stimulus light can eliminate this artifact. Several additional parameters can be extracted. The slope of RTs when 1, 2, 4, and 8 light choices are presented is used to index the rate of information processing. Variance or standard deviation in intra- individual RTs can be extracted to measure individual differences in response variability.  Findings  Following Hick's law, RTs slow as a function of the number of presented choices. Button presses are fastest when only one button is shown and slowest when all eight possible response buttons are available. Simple reaction time correlates with general cognitive ability, and there is some evidence that the slope of responding on the Jensen box does as well. Ian Deary and colleagues, in a population-based cohort study of 900 individuals, demonstrated correlations between IQ and simple choice RTs between -0.3 and -0.5. The Jensen box has also been used on the Odd Man Out test.

She is the consort and female counterpart of Samantabhadra, known amongst some Tibetan Buddhists as the 'Primordial Buddha'. Samantabhadri herself is known as the 'primordial Mother Buddha'. Samantabhadri is the dharmakaya dakini aspect of the Trikaya, or three bodies of a Buddha. As such, Samantabhadri represents the aspect of Buddhahood in whom delusion and conceptual thought have never arisen. As font or wellspring of the aspects of the divine feminine she may be understood as the 'Great Mother'. Seen differently, Samantabhadri is an aspect of Prajnaparamita.Samantabhadri as Prajnaparamita Samantabhadri is a figure found primarily in the Nyingma or 'Old Translation' school of Tibetan Buddhism. A figure that is nearly equivalent to Samantabhadri in the 'New Translation' or Sarma schools is Vajradhatu-ishvari; she is dark blue and her consort is Vajradhara. Samantabhadri is the expression of a concept essentially inexpressible in word or symbol, the ultimate voidness nature of mind. This aspect of the dakini is beyond gender, form or expression. According to Simmer Brown the power of the dakini in all her forms is based on the fact that all meditation practices ultimately point to the Samantabhadri dakini. In her iconography, Samantabhadri is white, the primary symbol of the wisdom aspect of mind - in contrast to her consort who is sky blue, representing limitlessness and formlessness. Like her consort she appears 'naked' (Sanskrit: digambara) and unadorned, representing the essential nature of mind. Samantabhadri is usually shown in yab-yum union with her consort but she is sometimes shown alone, seated in 'lotus posture' (also known as mahamudra) with her hands in meditation posture in her lap. Yeshe Tsogyal was known as an emanation of Samantabhadri, according to Judith Simmer-Brown in her subtlest form Yeshe Tsogyal was known as \\"expanse of mahƒÅsukha K√ºntusangmo [Samantabhadrƒ´], the all-good queen\\".

Previously he had been Church of Ireland Bishop of Clonfert (1724‚Äì1730), Ferns and Leighlin (1730‚Äì1734) and Meath (1734‚Äì1744). Childhood and patronage Arthur was the son of Samuel Price, vicar of Kildrought and Straffan in the diocese of Dublin and, from 1672, prebendary of Kildare. Arthur Price entered Trinity College Dublin, on 2 April 1696, aged seventeen, and was elected a scholar in 1698. He graduated BA in 1700 and DD on 16 April 1724. After taking holy orders he was successively curate of St Werburgh's Church, Dublin, and vicar of Celbridge, Feighcullen, and Ballybraine. His father's friendship with William \\"Speaker\\" Conolly (1662‚Äì1729) placed him in the way of the political patronage vital for advancement in the established church at the time. Arthur became William Conolly's chaplain and was named prebendary of Donadea on 4 April 1705. Arthur was appointed canon and Archdeacon of Kildare on 19 June 1715. A few months later Conolly was elected as speaker of the Irish House of Commons, confirming his position as chief undertaker now that the Whigs had returned to power in London. This was crucial for Price's future success. In 1719, he became Dean of Lismore; and on 31 March 1721 Ferns. Two years later he received the benefice of Louth in Armagh. He granted leases of some of the most valuable holdings to Price. In 1724, when Price was Dean of Ferns, but on his way to further promotions, had a fine stone house erected close by the old house of his father in Oakley Park in the recently renamed Celbridge. At the time of Conolly's ascendancy, as his speakership coincided with the Lord Lieutenancy of Charles Fitzroy, Duke of Grafton, Price was appointed to the see of Clonfert on 1 May 1724, a promotion that was described as \\"highly provocative\\" by the Irish chancellor, Alan Brodrick (1st Viscount Midleton), a former friend of Conolly's, who resented Conolly's emergence as chief manager or 'undertaker' of the government's parliamentary business. Irish bishoprics were normally given to English-born clerics in the 1700s, and Price's elevation was therefore seen as a patriotic gesture by Conolly. In the 1730s they built the Collegiate School Celbridge, a Charter school that closed in 1972. Guinness connection Price bought the Kildrought town malthouse in 1722 and was said to have placed his land steward Richard Guinness in charge of production of \\"a brew of a very palatable nature\\". However there is no contemporary evidence for this. After his death in 1752, Dr Price bequeathed ¬£100 each to Richard and his son, the 27-year-old Arthur Guinness; each was described as his \\"servant\\". Within a few years Arthur had set up a brewery in 1755 on a new site in Leixlip, and from 1759 he bought another at St James's Gate in Dublin. Four times a bishop After Conolly's death in 1729, Price was transferred from Clonfert on 26 May 1730, to the see of Ferns and Leighlin, where he had served as dean. On 2 February 1734, he was transferred to Meath, \\"on account of his loyalty to George II and his service to the House of Lords.\\" While bishop of Meath he began to build Ardbraccan House to the design of Richard Cassels but he left the diocese before it was completed, and the house remained unfinished for 40 years, with the Bishops living in one of the wings. Eventually, it was completed in the 1770s by Bishop Henry Maxwell. Archbishopric and death Round Tower from inside the ruins The Rock of Cashel pictured in the Summer of 1986. In May 1744, Dr Price succeeded Theophilus Bolton as archbishop of Cashel. He over-ruled plans already in train to restore the old cathedral, claiming that it was incapable of being re-roofed despite advice to the contrary. Using political contacts in the Irish Privy Council on 10 July 1749 he got permission to build a new cathedral. In 1783, a new cathedral building was completed on the site of St John's. In the meantime, what remained of the Rock of Cashel after Price had ordered its gutting and de-roofing, has become a primary tourist destination. Price's decision to remove the roof on what had been the jewel among Irish church buildings was criticised before and since.Rev. John Healy, LL.D, (Anglican Rector of Kells & Canon of St Patrick's, Dublin) History of the Diocese of Meath: Vol. II. (Association for Promoting Christian Knowledge; 1908) p.93. In 1747, he was made vice-chancellor of Trinity College Dublin. Price died in 1752 and was buried beneath the aisle of St Mary's church, Leixlip, County Kildare.

Different desk pads have specific uses, for example Chinese calligraphy uses a black velour desk pad since Chinese calligraphy is written using an ink brush. Westerners use simpler writing pads with disposable paper surfaces that can be used for writing, note taking, and scribbling, often these pads are pre-printed with calendar pages, however desk pads made of material (often leather) which serve to be written on and act as mouse pads are also common. Typical sizes for desk pads are A3 (420 √ó 297 mm , 11.7 √ó 16.5 in) and A2 (594 √ó 420 mm , 16.5 √ó 23.4 in). Desk pads are very popular promotional products, usually branded with a logo, contact information and product or service information. Desk pads are usually glued at the foot (bottom) of the pad to prevent the paper from curling. Many are glued to a grey backboard.

History The church was built in the middle of the 19th century for the newly established St Matthews parish which was created when the original Sheffield parish was subdivided into smaller parts in 1848. The first vicar J.F. Witty conducted the parish‚Äôs early services in a school on Carver Street. Within a few years sufficient funds had been raised to build a permanent place of worship. Land was purchased on Carver Street for ¬£600 and the foundation stone for the church was laid on 1 June 1854 with the construction being carried out by Flockton & Son. The building was consecrated on 6 June 1855 by the Archbishop of York Thomas Musgrave. The church which has been described as \\"a neat building with a graceful spire\\" cost ¬£3,297 to build, the main benefactor was the snuff maker Mr. Henry Wilson of Westbrook Mill who contributed ¬£1,020, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners granted ¬£200 and the Incorporated Church Building Society gave ¬£250. The rest of the money was raised by Reverend Witty who was still asking for subscriptions for the last ¬£200 in November 1856. In its early years the church had seating for 731 people which accommodated a large local congregation, the church being surrounded by a highly populated district of slum housing.\\"Illustrated Guide to Sheffield\\", Pawson & Brailsford, , Page 45 Gives quote \\"a neat building with a graceful spire\\", a list of benefactors and other details. In 1882 George Campbell Ommanney became the third vicar of St Matthew‚Äôs, he remained at the church for 54 years until his death in 1936. Ommanney was known as the ‚ÄúPeople‚Äô Priest‚Äù and was close to the common people, he chose to live in the slums nearby to the church. He converted St Matthew‚Äôs into a focal point for teaching and practice of the Catholic Revival in the Church of England, he wrote his memoirs in the book ‚ÄúOmmanney of Sheffield‚Äú in the final years of his life. St Matthews remained undamaged throughout World War II although there were casualties throughout the parish as many buildings were damaged in the immediate vicinity during the Sheffield Blitz of December 1940. The main entrance on Carver Street with the War Memorial plaque to the left and Crucifixtion statue above. In August 1956 parts of the church were damaged by fire including the organ and the Lady Chapel, which had only just been restored. In 1960 the last residential houses in the parish were demolished for shops and businesses, leaving the church without a resident congregation. In the 1970s the Church was threatened by the proposal to build a major road in the area which would have meant demolition but the plans were eventually changed. In 1982 the church‚Äôs two function rooms were upgraded and in 2000 the church received a major restoration externally and internally with funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The internal work included the cleaning of carbon deposits from the reredos and paintings, a result of Sheffield‚Äòs heavy industrial past. Present day The parish of St Matthew's has a growing resident population (pop: 5,690),http://www.cuf.org.uk/parish/350041 and is a busy church serving a lively city centre.

The first evidence of human settlement dates is a cairn from the Bronze Age (1700 to 500 B.C.E.) now located in Krithems Park. In the park are also round stones typical of a type of tomb from the Iron Age. Place name researchers believe that the name \\"Kristdala\\" comes from Kristusdalen (Christ Valley) or Kristusdalarna (Christ Valleys) and is related to the introduction of Christianity in the 12th century. Kristdala Church The medieval wooden Kristdala church was mentioned for the first time in 1358. It was demolished in 1792 and a new stone church was consecrated the same year. Kristdala Market Near the spot of Kristdala's first church was a marketplace that developed during the Middle Ages. The market lay at an important intersection, where five roads met, including roads from the coast (Figeholm, D√∂derhult and Oskarshamn) and from inland (Hultsfred and Vimmerby). Long ago, cattle trading was an important part of the market. Kristdala market is held twice a year: a summer market on the third Friday in July and a fall market in the fall around Michaelmas (29 September). The summer market is popular with tourists and is visited by approximately 20,000 people a year. Now, instead of cattle, people shop for candy, clothing, and other items.

As a congregation of the Church of Scotland, which is Presbyterian, the church is not technically a cathedral, in spite of its name. It is in the Pointed style, but suffered maltreatment in 1806 at the hands of restorers, whose work was subsequently removed during the restoration completed in 1902. The western gable with its flamboyant window, Gothic door and massive square tower, parts of the (much truncated) choir, and the nave pillars and clerestory are all that is left of the original edifice. The modern stained glass in the chancel is reckoned amongst the finest in Scotland. The cathedral is a category A listed building and the attached Round Tower is a scheduled monument. Round Tower Immediately adjoining the cathedral to the southwest stands the Round Tower, built about 1000 A.D. It is 86 ft.(26.21 m) high, has at the base a circumference of 50 ft.(15.3 m) and a diameter of 16 ft.(4.9 m), and is capped with a hexagonal spire of 18 ft.(5.5 m), added in the 14th century. This type of structure is somewhat common in Ireland, but the only Scottish examples are those at Brechin and Abernethy in Perthshire. The quality of the masonry is superior to all but a very few of the Irish examples. The narrow single doorway, raised some feet above ground level in a manner common in these buildings, is also exceptionally fine. The door-surround is enriched with two bands of pellets, and the monolithic arch has a well-preserved representation of the Crucifixion. The slightly splayed sides of the doorway (also monolithic) have relief sculptures of ecclesiastics, one of them holding a crosier, the other a Tau-shaped staff. Two monuments preserved within the cathedral, the so-called 'Brechin hogback', and a cross-slab, 'St. Mary's Stone' are further rare and important examples of Scottish 11th century stone sculpture. The hogback combines Celtic and Scandinavian motifs, and is the most complex known stone sculpture in the Ringerike style in Scotland. The inscribed St Mary's Stone has a circular border round the central motif of the Virgin and Child which echoes that on the Round Tower.

He is noted for his work on the novels of Charles Dickens published between 1871 and 1879 by Chapman and Hall. Life and work One of Barnard's illustrations of the Franco-Prussian War for The Illustrated London News Barnard was the son of a silversmith. He studied art under L√©on Bonnat in Paris, and worked in London and at Cullercoats on the Northumberland coast. His work was exhibited at the Royal Academy of Art. He also worked as an illustrator for Punch, The Illustrated London News, and Harper's Weekly. In 1870 Barnard married Alice Faraday, a niece of Michael Faraday. In the 1880s, Barnard and his wife joined a colony of artists at Broadway in the Cotswolds. In 1871 Barnard was commissioned by Chapman and Hall to illustrate nine volumes of the Household Edition of Dickens' work. It included Bleak House, A Tale of Two Cities, Sketches by Boz, Nicholas Nickleby, Barnaby Rudge, Dombey and Son and Martin Chuzzlewit. He followed in the footsteps of the respected illustrator Hablot Knight Browne who had worked with Dickens himself. Barnard created some 450 illustrations over an eight-year period, and became known as \\"the Charles Dickens among black-and-white artists.\\" Uriah Heep, by Fred Barnard Micawber and the twins, by Fred Barnard Barnard concentrated on illustrating scenes other than those that Browne and Dickens had chosen to portray. Whereas Browne was inclined to create dramatic group scenes for his prints, Barnard was more interested in showing the relationships between pairs of characters. At the same time, Barnard also had to seamlessly blend the characters as visualised by Browne with his own style, trying not to deviate too much from their established appearance. By the end of the nineteenth century, Barnard had also acquired a reputation as a portraitist to the aristocracy and the Royal Family. After the death of his son Geoffrey in 1891, Barnard went into a decline. His relationship with Alice suffered, and he fell into a deep depression, which he tried to escape by taking laudanum. On 27 September 1896 Barnard died in Wimbledon after his bedclothes caught fire from the pipe he was smoking while under the influence of a drug, probably laudanum. His cause of death was suffocation, although his body was also badly charred. Family Barnard was married to Alice Faraday (1847‚Äì1924) on the Isle of Wight on 11 August 1870. They had three children: Geoffrey (1872‚Äì1891), Dorothy, or \\"Dolly\\" (1878‚Äì1949), and Polly (1882-?). Geoffrey was an artist himself, who worked alongside his father until his death on 18 December 1891 in Evesham from congenital heart disease. The painter Elinor M. Barnard (1872‚Äì1942) was Barnard's niece. John Singer Sargent had become very close to the Barnard family by the time of Frederick's death. Barnard's daughters Dorothy and Polly served as the models for Sargent's painting Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose.Richard Ormond, \\"Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose,\\" in Stanley Olson et al., Sargent at Broadway: The Impressionist Years (New York: Universe/Coe Kerr Gallery, 1986). He would, in later years, take the Barnard girls along on his painting trips to southern Europe. In Sargent's will, drawn up in 1918, he left ¬£5000 to Alice Barnard.

His work is representative of the Italian figurative art of that period. His artistic production includes still lives, portraits, landscapes, nudes, and altar pieces. Biography  Born at Santa Maria Capua Vetere, Sicurezza studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Naples, winning a scholarship to fund his studies. He obtained a diploma in painting training under masters such as Carlo Siviero, Vincenzo Volpe, Vincenzo Migliaro and Paolo Vetri.The biographical information, also for the following chapters, originates from the books: Anna Luce Sicurezza, La sala \\"Antonio Sicurezza\\" nel palazzo municipale di Formia, Palombi Editori, Roma 2007, pages 17-21; Alessandra Lanzoni, La pittura di Antonio Sicurezza, De Luca Editori d'Arte, Roma 2011, pages 133-137. He moved to Formia in 1933-1934, when he was called to paint the chapel of St. Anthony in the church of Maranola. Here he met Virginia Mastrogiovanni whom he married in 1934. In the hardest times of World War II he, his wife, and their four children, fled first into the mountainous caves in Coreno Ausonio, then through the warfront to Calabria. After the war, the family returned to Formia. The war had destroyed and damaged the churches in the area, which held many of Sicurezzi's work. Among them were Angeli musicanti (Angels Playing Music), a fresco he painted for the chapel of Our Lady of Pompei and two oval portraits of Pope Leo XIII and Blessed Bartolo Longo. The search for new altar pieces, replacing the ones destroyed, it is not easy for both the difficult economic situation and the clergy that requires religious representations in line with the traditional iconography, which the artist sometimes agrees not to foreclose future commissions. Artistic maturity The Bride from Formia, \\"Antonio Sicurezza\\" hall, City Hall of Formia, 1978. When Antonio Sicurezza could finally express himself more freely, he had artistically valuable results, such as the works of the apse of St. John, St. Albina in the church of Saint Erasmus, and then, above all, the paintings of St. Francis and of the Annunciation at the church of Our Lady of Carmine and that of Saint Roch in Pico. It is valuable to note that the landscape behind the figures is represented in a deliberately simple manner, so that the faithful can recognize immediately the local sights and monuments, as in St. Albina and in St. Francis, in which it is particularly significant the view of the large Gaeta gulf. Still Life With Onions, 1976, private collection. In the summertime he worked outside to paint landscapes and alleys, while during the rest of year he worked in his studio mainly with charcoal and watercolors or tempera. He produced sketches and studies for religious themes or he painted still lives with immediacy and lightness. After the summer of 1965 he left teaching and set up the large study that, among carob trees and prickly pears, he had built on the land of Santa Maria la Noce. It was now easier to prepare sketches and large cartoons for religious works and then ‚Äì limiting the charcoal and pastel studies ‚Äì he could systematically focus on oil painting, especially of the human figures and still lives. In fact the style change, which made him prefer oil painting and saw the use of systematic and almost exclusive spatula instead of a brush, occurred in the late Fifties. Some of the paintings exhibited in Rome in July 1961, including two paintings that were awarded to the contemporary art exhibition held in Turin in the context of the events of Italy '61, already put in evidence the use of the spatula to illustrate the human figure and objects. In the following years he devoted a greater commitment to personal and collective exhibitions, with a lack of direction, but without referring to a gallery or an agent and tied to a provincial reality. Despite this, he won several distinctions and awards, and news about him with reproductions of his works can be found in various catalogues of contemporary artists. Final years Clean hands, 1969, private collection With advancing age, Antonio Sicurezza and his wife moved to the centre of Formia. The last house was more chaotic for the desire of finding the proper light for each painting. Yet, despite his age and disorder, the work was intense. To complete a painting he took around five sessions, which meant at least two new works every week. He worked both mornings and afternoons, often devoting first energies to harder works such as the naked human figures. In the living room the walls are covered with framed paintings, while others are simply placed in the corners. It is here that he received friends and admirers. It was during this period the groups of young people with musical instruments that the artist calls concerts, many nudes, vigorous still lives and some outside scenes were painted. Exceptionally, in August 1978 Antonio Sicurezza did not go to Santa Maria Capua Vetere for the annual celebration of the Assumption. It was the beginning of the sickness that, a year later, August 29, 1979, brought the artist to die in Formia at the age of 74 years. Critical analysis The Bride from Minturno, 1961, private collection Still Life With Anchovies, 1972, \\"Antonio Sicurezza\\" hall, City Hall of Formia The background assumptions of Sicurezza's painting are based on values indispensable for him: the respect of human dignity and the sacredness of work. The artist continued to explore and experiment with constant application for many years to reach its capacity of synthesis in painting.The critical comments originate from: Anna Luce Sicurezza, \\"La sala \\"antonio Sicurezza\\" nel palazzo municipale di Formia\\", Palombi Editori, Roma 2007, chapter \\"Una breve analisi critica\\"; Alessandra Lanzoni, \\"La pittura di Antonio Sicurezza\\", De Luca Editori d'Arte, Roma 2011, chapter \\"La maturit√† artistica\\". His style reaches maturity based on two fundamental elements: the physical construction of the subject, with increasing use of the spatula to distribute and overlay color, and the mention of the deliberately unfinished around the main theme. The result of all this is a subjective realism. Through the filter of the artist, the performance is careful and accurate for its main theme and the parties to which are assigned a significant role. The same performance is tempered and sometimes only mentioned in the rest of the composition. Two other considerations must be made: color and atmosphere. Sicurezza manifests for the color a particular passion and he accepts difficult challenges. The atmosphere should be clarified as a physical fact: the atmosphere of the corner of the world where the painter lived and characterized by an extraordinary transparency and brightness, and in which the subjects of his paintings systematically lie, receiving security and serenity. Antonio Sicurezza, in a century that profoundly transforms reality, puts himself stubbornly in the vein of realism. The artist, at once humble and stubborn, finds his formula of expression in ancient heritage but with original and modern execution. \\"The result reached by Antonio Sicurezza is the result of his research, where the responsiveness of more accurate technical means resolves the discovery of the deeper meaning of reality. Therefore, an understanding that surpasses all interpretations animates his painting, to respect it in its entirety. For this reason, in its naked flesh, the more flesh it is, the more chaste\\" (Luigi Volpicelli). Elio Marciano for the female nude observes that \\"the earthly reality of the fine figures of young girls is filled with love of classical perfection of chaste nudity.\\" Guido Bernardi instead puts its focus on humble objects represented in the paintings of the painter, who, \\"with a wonderful insight figured object, is able to convey continuous points of joy and reflection\\". Mario Lepore ascribes to the works of Antonio Sicurezza \\"the solidity of a job not only well known but also rich in resources and, most importantly, that shows a genuine temperament, from the narrative paintings skills. The quality of design and composition, sensitivity to color and light, reality probated but also poetically observed, often allow him to achieve beautiful accents\\". Other critical interventions are often united by a thin thread that identifies values early in the artist and natural attachment to popular traditions, moral honesty, humility and frank simplicity.

It is the terminal stage and most aggressive form of these dyscrasias, constituting 2% to 4% of all cases of plasma cell malignancies. PCL may present as primary plasma cell leukemia, i.e. in patients without prior history of a plasma cell dyscrasia or as secondary plasma cell dyscrasia, i.e. in patients previously diagnosed with a history of its predecessor dyscrasia, multiple myeloma. The two forms of PCL appear to be at least partially distinct from each other. In all cases, however, PCL is an extremely serious, life-threatening, and therapeutically challenging disease. Signs and symptoms  Primary PCL  The clinical presentation of primary PCL (pPCL) indicates a far more aggressive disease than that of a typical multiple myeloma case with its clinical features being a combination of those found in multiple myeloma and acute leukemia. Like multiple myeloma patients, pPCL patients exhibit pathologically high levels of monoclonal plasma cells in their bone marrow plus a malignant plasma cell-secreted circulating monoclonal myeloma protein, either IgG, IgA, a light chain, or none in 28-56%, 4-7%, 23-44%, or 0-12% of cases, respectively. Similar to B cell leukemias, but unlike multiple myeloma, pPCL patients exhibit relative high frequencies of splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, kidney failure, bone marrow failure (i.e. thrombocytopenia, anemia, and/or, rarely, leukopenia), central nervous system defects, and peripheral neuropathies due to the invasion of these tissues by plasma cells and/or the deposition of their circulating monoclonal immunoglobulin in them. Compared to multiple myeloma patients, pPCL patients also: exhibit 1) high rates of developing a hypercalcemic crisis, i.e. a potentially life-threatening episode of high ionic calcium (Ca2+) levels in the blood due to excess bone re-absorption and/or renal failure; b) higher levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase and Beta-2 microglobulin; and c) lower rates of bone but higher rates of soft tissue plasma cell tumors termed plasmacytomas.  Secondary PCL  Secondary PCL (sPCL) is diagnosed in 1-4% of patients known to have had multiple myeloma for a median time of ~21 months. It is the terminal phase of these patients myeloma disease. sPCL patients typically are highly symptomatic due to extensive disease with malignant plasma cell infiltrations in, and failures of, not only the bone marrow but also other organs. They have failed or broken through one or more treatment regimens and therefore may also show some of the toxic effects of these treatments. Cause PCL is caused by the development of an excessively high number of genetic abnormalities in plasma cells or, more particularly, their precursor B cells and plasmablasts (see plasma cells). This genetic instability is due to a myriad of acquired abnormalities including gene mutations; single nucleotide polymorphisms; depletions and duplications of parts of a gene, larger portion of a chromosome, or even an entire arm of a chromosome; translocations, deletions, and duplications of entire chromosomes; and increases and decreases in the expression of intact genes due to, e.g. the methylation of gene promotors and various less direct effects. These genetic abnormalities effect the Wnt signaling pathway, regulation of the cell cycle, RNA metabolism, protein folding, and cadherin-related cell adherence to extracellular matrix. These effects in turn control plasma cell proliferation, survival, apoptosis, adhesion to bone marrow, genome stability, and secretion of monoclonal immunoglobulins. Secondary plasma cell leukemia (sPCL) results from the comparatively slow development of plasma cell/plasma cell precursor genetic abnormalities which initially create a clone of cells that cause the premalignant condition of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. In a very small percentage of these cases, the progressive development of further genetic abnormalities serially create a clone(s) of plasma cells that cause the more serious but still premalignant disorder of smoldering multiple myeloma, overt myeloma cancer, and ultimately sPCL. In contrast to sPCL, pPCL presents de novo with a broad range of genetic abnormalities. For example, advanced methods for examining the genome viz., whole-exome sequencing and gene expression profiling, have identified 166 non-silent gene variants per pPCL patient sample at the time of diagnosis. These abnormalities are similar but not identical to those detected in sPCL while the abnormalies detected in sPCL more closely resemble those detected in multiple myeloma than do those of pPCL: the genetic data support the clinical data in suggesting that sPCL and pPCL are distinct diseases with sPCL among the two PCLs being more closely related to multiple myeloma. Examination of plasma cell immunophenotype by measuring certain of their cell surface antigens, particularly Cluster of differentiation. CD markers on plasma cells from patients with pPCL differ from those taken form multiple myeloma or sPCL patients. For example: pPCL plasma cells more often express CD20 antigen, which is considered important in anchoring plasma cells to the bone marrow stroma, than do those on plasma cells taken from myeloma patients (50% vs. 17%); pPCL plasma cells often lack CD56 antigen which is present on the majority of plasma cells taken form multiple myeloma patients; and pPCL plasma cells more frequently express CD28 than do sPCL plasma cells. Thus, immunophenotyping supports that notion that multiple myeloma, sPCL, and pPCL show critically important fundamental differences that may explain their different clinical presentations, courses, responses to therapy, and prognoses. Diagnosis The International Myeloma Working Group has defined the diagnostic criteria for plasma cell leukemia as the presence in blood of >2x109 plasma cells per liter or, alternatively, >20% of nucleated blood cells being plasma cells. More recently, the Group has suggested that values of 0.5x109 or 5%, respectively, may be more appropriate from a therapeutic viewpoint and therefore should be studied as a definitive criterion for the disease. A recent study supported this suggestion in finding that multiple myeloma patients with >5% circulating plasma cells had a prognosis much worse than that for multiple myeloma and similar to that for plasma cell leukemia. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping of blood cells to detect clonal phenotypes of plasma cells seen in multiple myeloma (e.g. the CD138+, CD38+, CD19‚àí, CD45+/- phenotype) may be a more sensitive method to enumerate circulating clonal plasma cells and diagnose plasma cell leukemia.  Treatments  Prior to the use of newly developed drugs and treatment regimens, median survival rates from the time of diagnosis for pPCL and sPCL were 8‚Äì11 months and 2‚Äì8 months, respectively, even when treated very aggressively with the VAD regimen of vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone or the VCMP regimen of vincristine, carmustine, melphalan, and prednisone alternating with vincristine, carmustine, doxorubicin, and prednisone. The treatment of PCL patients, particularly pPCL patients, with newer methods appears to have made modest improvements in survival rates. However, the rarity of these two leukemias has limited individual studies to case reports on a small number of patients or rectrospective analyses of patient records. Randomized controlled trials on these patients have not been reported. One flaw of these methods is patient selection bias, i.e. patients selected for treatment with a new regimen may be less ill than average patients with the disease and therefore have an intrinsically less aggressive (i.e. longer overall survival time) disease.  Primary plasma cell leukemia  Recent case report studies suggest that treatment regimens which include a proteasome inhibitor drug, particularly bortezomib, and/or autologous stem- cell transplantation have improved pPCL survival. For example, 28 patients treated with a bortezomib-based induction regimen followed by autologous stem- cell transplantation and then a maintenance regimen of lenaldomide (an immunosuppressant related to thalidomide), bortezomib, and dexamethasone (a corticosteroid) has a progression free survival rate of 66% at 3 years and an overall survival rate of 73% at 4 years. In one study, patients receiving intensive chemotherapy plus autologous stem-cell transplantation had a median survival of 34 months while those receiving chemotherapy alone had a median survival of 11 months. Two other studies that included bortezomib in their chemotherapy regimens likewise found that the addition of autologous stem-cell transplantation improved results. Current recommendations for treating pPCL often include induction with a three drug regimen such as borezomib- lenalidomide-dexamethasone followed by autologous stem-cell transplantion and consolidation/maintenance with of combination of immunomodulator agents (e.g. thalidomide, lenalidomide, or pomalidomide) plus a proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib, ixazomib, or carfilzomib.  Secondary plasma cell leukemia  As the end stage of multiple myeloma that has failed or broken through one or more therapeutic regimens, sPCL continues to be highly refractory to various treatment regimens (<50%), very short response times of these regiments, and poor overall survival rates (median survival of 2-8 to months). Patients with sPCL may have short-lived responses to treatment regimens (as communicated in case reports) that include bortezomid but there are no established therapeutic regimens that have clearly been shown to improve their overall or median survival.

After his early MGM Studios work under Jack Dawn and William J. Tuttle, he did a pioneering stint at the Star Trek TV series, and created the formula for Spock's ears. In 1980 Phillips was nominated for a Saturn Award for best makeup on the film Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Career Early in his career, Phillips went uncredited as a make-up artist on a number of films including The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Around the World in Eighty Days (1956). His credited work included Blacula (1972) and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975). He went by a number of names on credits, including Fred B. Phillips, Fred Phillips and Fred Philipps. On television, he worked on the complete run of The Outer Limits as well as other shows such as The Adventures of Superboy. Star Trek Because Spock's ears are some of the most visible and famous makeup appliances associated with Star Trek: The Original Series, many people believe that Phillips, as the designated make-up artist for the show, designed Spock's ears. However, this is not true. There was a contract in place with an outside company to make the ears, but after several failed attempts, Fred Phillips called a former colleague of his, Charlie Shram, who was then the head of makeup at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios (MGM). As a favor to Phillips, Shram took a mold of Nimoy's ears and designed and manufactured the first usable set of Spock ears prior to the production of the first (rejected/unaired) pilot episode, \\"The Cage.\\"Cushman, Marc with Susan Osborn, These Are the Voyages TOS Season One, Revised Edition, Jacobs/Brown Press, San Diego, California, December 2013, p. 59 While working on Star Trek: The Original Series, Phillips would create new ears every few days in batches by baking them. Not every pair fit actor Leonard Nimoy successfully and so multiples were required.Gerrold & Sawyer, ed. (2006): p. 36 They were made out of latex, and were fragile, easily being damaged while being removed or during scenes. The mould and two pairs of ears were listed by Christie's auction house in 2000, with the expectation that the mould itself would sell for up to $20,000. In addition to his work on the Vulcans, he also designed the original Klingons, Romulans and the majority of the other aliens in the series. He went on to work on Star Trek: The Motion Picture, and was responsible for shaving Persis Khambatta's head so that she could portray Ilia in the film. He was asked to return for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, but due to his diminishing eyesight, he turned the offer down. Prior to the adoption of digital media, Phillips was occasionally conflated with an eponymous New York City science fiction fan who helped to popularize the Society for Creative Anachronism and the works of H.P. Lovecraft. Awards He was nominated for a Saturn Award for his work on Star Trek: The Motion Picture, which he shared with his daughter Janna Phillips and fellow make-up artist Ve Neil. Phillips was awarded a lifetime achievement award for his makeup work in 1983 by the Society of Operating Cameramen.

The tomb was the source of a number of famous decorated tomb scenes that are currently on display in the British Museum, London. Nebamun (c 1350 BCE) was a middle-ranking official scribe and grain counter at the temple complex in Thebes. His tomb was discovered in 1820 by a young Greek, Giovanni (\\"Yanni\\") d‚ÄôAthanasi, who was acting as an agent for Henry Salt, the British Consul- General. The tomb's plastered walls were richly and skilfully decorated with lively fresco paintings, depicting idealised views of Nebamun‚Äôs life and activities. D‚ÄôAthanasi and his workmen literally hacked out the pieces he wanted with knives, saws and crowbars. Salt sold these works to the British Museum in 1821, though some of other fragments became located in Berlin and possibly Cairo. D‚ÄôAthanasi later died in poverty without ever revealing the tomb‚Äôs exact location. The best-known of the tomb‚Äôs paintings include Nebamun fowl hunting in the marshes, dancing girls at a banquet, and a pond in a garden. In 2009, the British Museum opened up a new gallery dedicated to the display of the restored eleven wall fragments from the tomb. They have been described as the greatest paintings from ancient Egypt to have survived, and as one of the Museum's greatest treasures. Various scenes from the paintings have been used by artists in more modern times.

He was the father of Rukmi and Rukmini, who married the Hindu deity Krishna. Previous life Once there was a temple priest who was a staunch devotee of Shiva. He used to do Pooja to Lord Shiva's feet (Shiva Paada Pooje) every day. After finishing his Pooja and closing the temple premises, the priest brought prasadha (food from the temple which is first offered to the lord) for a dog which waited outside the temple. As dogs symbolise loyalty, the dog used to accompany the priest till he reached home every day and only ate food offered by this priest. The priest had great affection towards the dog as well. On one new moon day (Amavasya), after some delay in finishing his temple duties, the priest shut the temple premises and walked out fast to offer food for the dog. Because it was a dark night, the priest accidentally walked over the dogs face. Every dog's nature is to attack anyone who attacks it. The dog instantaneously bit the priest before it could realise that the person it bit was the priest whom the dog admired. Albeit getting bit by the dog, the priest offered the dog the prasadha. The dog, regretting its previous action, did not accept the food. The dog never ate anything after the incident and died in front of the same Shiva temple. The gods, seeing this great gesture of loyalty from the dog, awarded the post of the sun (Surya) with the name Vivasvan. Many years later, the priest had also died in memory of the dog. In his next life, this Brahmin priest took birth as a king at the land of Vidarbha with the name Bhishmaka. The position he attained in this birth is attributed to all the Shiva Paada Pooje (worshipping lord Shiva's feet) that was performed by the Brahmin priest. Rukmini's bliss King Bhishmaka had 1 Daughter : Rukmini, and 5 Sons : Rukmi, Rukmaratha, Rukmakethu, Rukmabahu, Rukmanetra. The sun god Vivasvan wished to see Bhishmaka ( still retaining affection from the King's previous life ) and so disguised himself as a Rishi (Sage) and came down to the earth. King Bhishmaka upon seeing the rishi showed overwhelming affection towards him, again due to their relationship from the previous birth. Bhishmaka took the Rishi to his palace where Rukmini worshipped the rishi is a very devoted manner. The rishi then advised Rukmini to do Pooja for Lord Shiva's feet (Shiva Paada Pooje) for attaining god's blessings. Rukmini made garlands for the lord, offered gandha (sandalwood) and other auspicious materials to the god's feet. This pooja was most effective during the days of Nakshatra. The prayers turned out to be so powerful that lord Shiva blessed Rukmini with the boon to marry the great Lord Krishna himself. The Shiva paada pooja takes place at most Shiva temples even today and is considered one of the most effective ways to offer prayers to lord Shiva. Many devotees throng to temples during the Shiva paada pooja to do their part in serving the lord.

Emen is a village in Veliko Tarnovo Municipality, Veliko Tarnovo Province, Bulgaria, famous for the nearby caves and canyon. In recent years it has become a major tourist destination, receiving both domestic and foreign visitors. Emen's population is about 100 people,Population table of Bulgaria as of 2008 but it triples during the summer. History The Emen cave bears evidence of human habitation, dated to the Neolith.Pre-historic settlements in Bulgaria Later, Romans settled in the area and built an outpost on Kaleto hill on the verge of the present-day village. Fortifications included a rock wall from two sides, while the other two sides were naturally protected by the vertical walls of the Emen canyon. Nowadays, parts of the wall are preserved, but treasure-hunter raids have reduced archaeological evidence. The present-day name of the village is said to derive from the times of the Ottoman rule over Bulgaria. Emen was the name of the Turk who owned all the land and Christian people of the village. With the Liberation of Bulgaria he was most likely expelled from the country, but the village kept its name. Today, a single Turkish family lives in Emen, but it bears no relation to the previous landowner. Geography and natural sights The Emen (Momin Skok) waterfall Emen is located in Veliko Tarnovo Province, about 20 km away from capital of the province. The river Negovanka, a tributary to Rositsa flows right through the village, through the Emen Canyon and ends up in the Mihaltsi dam situated about 5 km north of the village. The name of the river comes from Latin and means short river with a near source. In Palaeolithic times, the river carved a gorge (or canyon), which bears the name of the village. The Emen Canyon consists of two parts, called Goren (Upper) and Dolen (Lower) Boaz.The name derives from the Turkish word for a passage (pass). The Upper Boaz stretches through 5 km from the nearby village of Novo Selo to Emen, itself. The Lower part of the canyon begins in the north part of Emen and eventually opens up after the Mihaltsi dam. The Emen Canyon was declared a Natural Monument in 1980. As a result, some human activities like lumbering and driving motor vehicles are prohibited on the 25.5 hectare area of the Natural Monument.Emen Canyon's entry in the Register of Protected Areas in Bulgaria It partially overlaps with another Natural Monument - the Momin Skok one, which encompasses a small area around the waterfall of the same name.Momin Skok's entry in the Register of Protected Areas in Bulgaria One of the first eco paths in Bulgaria passes through the Emen Gorge on its way to the Momin Skok Waterfall. The Emen cave is located at the very beginning of the eco path. With its length of 3,113 meters, it is the 17th longest cave in Bulgaria. This has made it suitable for all kinds of human activities during the years. It has consecutively been used to grow mushrooms and mature cheese. In Communist times it even became an arms depot of a military base located immediately above it. Currently, human presence in the cave is, at least officially, restricted to allow for bats to breed uninterrupted. Bat species inhabiting the cave include: greater horseshoe bat, Blasius's horseshoe bat, Mediterranean horseshoe bat, common bent-wing bat, greater and lesser mouse-eared bat.2010 Bat Monitoring Report by the National Museum of Natural History bg icon Speleologists from Ruse have discovered a large cave system in the vicinity of the village during expeditions between 1986 and 1991. The caves Ruse (3,306 metres long), Troana (3,234 m) and Bambalova Dupka (2,923 m) are all located in the Lower Boaz.

The episode was aired on 12 February 2006, with a repeat of the episode being aired a week later on 19 February. The special saw hosts Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May travelling to Lillehammer, Norway and creating their own version of the Winter Olympics with cars. The episode was later released on DVD on 5 June later that year. Summary With the 20th Winter Olympic Games being held in Turin, Italy, Top Gear decides to do its own version with cars, with Jeremy Clarkson and James May heading to one of the Winter Games' former venues - Lillehammer, in Norway, used during the 1994 Winter Games - and beginning proceedings, despite Richard Hammond not being there; he was away doing Daytime Television while the pair began the first set of events. Events * Biathlon In a race between Clarkson and May, the pair took to a snowy, cross-country course with some off-road SUVs, where along the way, each presenter had to stop at 2 shooting rounds and hit all the targets in each round from the back of their cars, incurring a 5 seconds penalty for each target missed. May choose the Audi Q7 and used a standard Biathlon .22 rifle for the shooting rounds, while Clarkson raced in a Volvo XC90 and opted to use a H&K; MP5 Sub machine gun, but despite the increased firepower, he missed all his target on the first shooting round, allowing his rival to increase the lead he had. May's second shooting round was not as perfect as his first, and he incurred a ten-second penalty for missing targets, before crashing into a tree on his way to the finish line. Clarkson, although missing all his targets again in the second round, managed to overtake May as he was digging himself out, but just before he reached the end, Clarkson lost the lead to his rival, coming in second after May crossed the line and won the event. * Cold Weather Endurance Although not with them at Lillehammer, Hammond had early done a film for the special, in which he saw whether a man would break first from Arctic temperatures, or a car. Sitting within a Citro√´n C1, in a bid to see who would crack first, both the presenter and the car were subjected to ever decreasing temperatures, with Hammond testing the car's electrics and engine. Finally, after being subjected to a temperature of about minus-40 Celsius, Hammond could not start the C1 and thus proved that a man could last longer than the car, concluding that 'if you're going to drive to the North Pole, buy a Hammond'. His conclusion was disproved when he took part in a race against a car to the North Pole, and lost, as was shown in the Polar Challenge following Series 9 of the show. * Speed Skating Returning to Norway, Clarkson prepared himself for a 3-lap race on the ice course of Vikingskipet Olympic Arena, between a Jaguar XK and a human skater, whom May introduced as Eskil Ervik. While Ervik got off to a good start, the XK couldn't utilize its power as the car had no grip on the ice and thus could only move forward slowly and not corner so well, while the wheels constantly spun upon the surface. Not only did this allow Ervik to win the race, it also allowed him to lap the XK twice. * Off-Road Slalom In another race between Clarkson and May, the presenters took to completing a course against the clock, on a frozen lake with just five inches of ice. The race was between a four-wheel drive Land Rover Discovery and another two-wheel drive Jaguar XK. The race ended with a dispute about the end result - while May declared he was the winner by being the fastest with a time of 2:03.28, Clarkson claimed otherwise by saying that his run had been more graceful and interesting than his colleague's. * Bobsleigh In a re-run of a film shown during Series 5 of the show, Hammond and May travelled to Lillehammer in 2004 to make use of the bobsleigh course. Their aim was to see if a bobsleigh team aided by Hammond, who would be subject to cornering forces of up to 5G, could beat a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution rally car, which would be driven by Norwegian Henning Solberg with May as co-driver. For the rally car, it would run on a snowy dirt road that had exactly the same length of the course, not only starting and stopping the same places, but also consisting of slippery surfaces and sharp corners. While the bobsleigh would be time by the course officials, May would be timing the rally car. Despite a close race, the bobsleigh turned in a time of 59.68 at the end, beating the rally car by just over 2 seconds after it came in with a time of 1:02.24. * Ice Hockey On a break from Daytime Television, Hammond finally arrived in Lillehammer, and prepared himself to take on May in a game of \\"5-a-side Car Ice Hockey\\". Using ten Suzuki Swifts and with Clarkson acting as referee, Hammond was captain of \\"team daytime television\\" who played in Montreal Canadiens colours, while May was captain of \\"team primetime television\\" who played in Buffalo Sabres colours. From the start, Hammond's team played well and led 3-0, but a biased Clarkson began intervening in the match and allowed May to catch up with two goals, allowing the score to be 3-2. After one of the Swifts had to be replaced, Hammond crashed into May's car and was sent to the penalty box (\\"sin bin\\"), before being allowed out after May attempted to score more goals, just as the match ended, with his side winning. Although Hammond declared he was returning to Daytime Television following the match, upon learning what the next event was planning, he quickly declared he was staying for it. Behind the scenes, the score supposedly had been 5-4 to Hammond's team, although only three of May's team's goals were shown in the programme. * Ski Jump After watching a skier perform a ski jump off a downhill slope, the presenters learned they had been tasked to see if they could get a 1986 Mini to do the same jump and landing it further than the skier did. After thinking over whether this could be done with the car's own power, May revealed it would not have any chance of success; there was also concerns it would be unsafe for anyone drive the Mini while attempting the ski jump. Thus, Clarkson called in for help from the United Kingdom Rocketry Association.Propulsion for the unmanned Mini was provided by 3 rocket motors put into the rear of the car To get it into position, the Mini was winched to the top of the slope along the specially cut groves for the jump. The custom-made skis can be seen beneath the car's tyres The following day, May, tasked with handling the unmanned Mini's guidance, revealed that the car would need skis for the special groves that would be cut for it on the ski jump they were using. The Rocketry Association, who were working on the Power for the jump (with Clarkson's help), decided to also work on making some custom-made skis for the Mini upon learning of this. Meanwhile, Hammond began work on setting up a barrier to stop the Mini after it made its jump, but after making a clumsy one before the wrong jump, recruited a herd of tractors to set up a wall of hay bales at the bottom of the jump, backed with a large snow bank to ensure the car stopped fully and safely. As night fell, the Mini, now laden with rockets, was carefully put into place on the special groves and winched to the top of the jump, given final checks, and eventually was launched down the jump. Although it failed to beat the skier's distance, the presenters were more than satisfied that the Mini had managed to successfully do the ski jump, which was extraordinary feat in itself. With the final event completed, Hammond left, while Clarkson and May decided to stay behind for one last challenge - to see if a ski jump could be done by a snowmobile. For this last challenge, the pair revealed that The Stig had been saved for this task, and successfully performed the jump with the snowmobile, with Clarkson joking about the pain he would be feeling from his landing, as the special came to and end. The end credits of the edited as a reference to the members of Swedish pop group ABBA, with Jeremy Clarkson shown as Bj√∂rn Clarkson, Richard Hammond as Benny Hamond, James May as Agnetha May and The Stig as Anni-Frid Stig, whilst every other crew member had their first name replaced with Bj√∂rn.

It was designed by the architects of the Bournville Village Trust under the direction of Selby Clewer. Part of the parish was taken from that of St Gabriel's Church, Weoley Castle. Architecture The church is dominated by its large lantern tower which not only illuminates the interior but also acts as a local landmark. The distinctive green copper roof was replaced with stainless steel in 2011-2012 after a number of thefts of copper sheeting. The consecration stone, and dedication stones were brought from St David's Cathedral by the local scout troop in a handcart. Organ The church contains a pipe organ dating from 1970 by Bowen of Northampton. It was enlarged in 1999 by Trevor Tipple of Worcester.

The premiere was directed by Howard Davies. In an interview, the National's director Nicholas Hytner stated \\"[Lenkiewicz's] new play ... will take its place in the Olivier rep alongside work by Shaw, Middleton and Tony Harrison.\\" Plot The play is set during British women's struggle for the vote in the early 20th century, beginning with a suffragette trying to pin a suffragette sash on the kings horse at the Derby and ending with the outbreak of World War I. It is centred on a love-affair between two fictional suffragettes, one upper-class called: Lady Celia Cain (played in the premiere by Lesley Manville) and the other working-class called: Eve Douglas (played in the premiere by Jemima Rooper). Inception In a National Theatre programme note, Lenkiewicz has written \\"I used to work at the National Film Theatre as an usherette and on my breaks I'd often go out to the river with a cup of tea and scour the bookstalls under Waterloo Bridge. One large paperback volume Shoulder to Shoulder cried out to me to be bought. It was by Midge Mackenzie and was a documentary account of the suffragettes. It was a battered copy and cost a tenner...and from devouring that book came my urge to write about the period and a desire to put those women into the foreground once more; their bravery and brilliance.\\"Rebecca Lenkiewicz, programme note for Her Naked Skin Reception Most of the critical reaction to the premiere was good, managing four stars in the Evening Standard, Guardian, Independent and Time Out and three in the Times, though the critic from The Times criticised what he saw as the caricaturing of the male characters. Some critics also felt the lesbian love affair was concentrated on at the expense of the historical background, though some have argued against such as criticism.

The Company (all railway locomotives and cars) perform the number as a glorification to Steam. The solo lines are taken by Poppa, an old Steam Locomotive, (and Belle the Sleeping Car before she was cut). Music The music, by Andrew Lloyd Webber, has a gospel feel and starts off in G major. Lyrics The lyrics, by Richard Stilgoe, involve many clever plays on words related to the subject of Railway Travel. :There's a Light at the End of the Tunnel :There's a Light at the End of the Tunnel :The inside might be as black as the night :But at the end of the tunnel, there's a light The title is an old saying, one of many inspired by the railway. Other's include 'On the Right Track' and 'Full Steam Ahead'. Reference to James Watt The lyrics include a verse and a chorus which pay respect the father of steam, James Watt. :'It's the power of James Watt, the steaming Scot :'The man who watched the pot and said, \\"Hey, I've got :'A brilliant plot, when that steam is hot :'It seems to make a lot of power\\" and later; :'Thanks James Watt (Thank you Mr. Watt) :'For watching that pot Alternate Versions Ein Licht ganz am Ende des Tunnels The German version. The title translates as 'A Light at the very end of the Tunnel'. The Megamix The Megamix was added into the London re-write in 1992, and was added to the German production in 2003. It is an assortment of verses from 'Light at the End of the Tunnel' with lines/verses from other popular songs added in between. Deletion of Belle As the original material was written for two characters as a company to sing, it had to be altered dramatically when one of those characters was deleted. When Belle was cut, several different productions dealt with the loss differently. The London show had Poppa sing the lines she sang in addition to his, and the company took the lines she sang in conversation. In early Bochum, the coaches took all of Belle's lines, and the revised version likened to the London re-write. Recordings *Lon Satton, P.P.

Following the success of 1996 album Esclava De Tu Piel and its string of hit singles Az√∫car Moreno released their first career retrospective, Mucho Az√∫car - Grandes √âxitos, (roughly translated as Lots of Sugar - Greatest Hits). The compilation covers their hits from 1988 through to 1997, thus excluding material from their first two albums recorded for EMI Music, starting with their Spanish breakthrough single \\"Debajo Del Olivo\\", the version used is however not the remixed house music hit version, subtitled Mix in Spain, later included on the remix albums Mix In Spain (1989) and The Sugar Mix Album (1990) but the original album version from 1988's Carne De Melocot√≥n. Mucho Az√∫car continues with four titles from their international breakthrough album Bandido including the title track \\"Bandido\\" with which they represented Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest 1990 in Zagreb, Yugoslavia and finished fifth, the follow-up \\"Ven Dev√≥rame Otra Vez\\", \\"Oye C√≥mo Va\\"/\\"Guajira\\" and \\"A Caballo\\". The 1991 album Mambo is represented by just two of the five singles released; the title track \\"Mambo\\" and \\"T√∫ Quieres Mas (Porque Te Amo)\\" - lead single \\"Torero!\\" is consequently omitted. \\"Hazme El Amor\\" is the only track from 1992's Ojos Negros, while the compilation features two tracks from 1994's El Amor; the title track \\"El Amor\\" which also appeared in the Hollywood movie The Specialist and \\"No Ser√° Facil\\" and finally three tracks from the duo's at the time most recent album Esclava De Tu Piel, \\"S√≥lo Se Vive Una Vez\\", \\"Hoy Tengo Ganas De Ti\\" and the title track \\"Esclava De Tu Piel\\". Mucho Az√∫car also features one new recording, \\"Mu√©vete Salvaje\\", originally recorded the previous year by fellow Sony act Cherokee. Just like Esclava De Tu Piel, \\"Mu√©vete Salvaje\\" was produced by Ricardo \\"Eddy\\" Martinez and turned into another big hit single for the Salazar sisters. The single was released as two different editions, one as a double A-side with 1990's \\"Bandido\\" (some pressings mistakenly claim that the track is a new remix by Ra√∫l Orellana - the version appearing on all editions is in fact the original album version). The second single was entitled Mucho Az√∫car Remixes - Mu√©vete Salvaje Y Otros Remixes and was an eight track E.P., including four versions of \\"Mu√©vete Salvaje\\", the Radio Edit, the Hard Funk Mix, the Hard Core Flamenco Mix and the original Mucho Az√∫car album version, plus \\"Oye C√≥mo Va\\"/\\"Guajiro\\" and \\"Debajo Del Olivo\\" - both remixes from The Sugar Mix Album, as well as \\"Hava Naguila\\" (Broken House Remix) and \\"S√≥lo Se Vive Una Vez\\" (Euroflam Mix). While Sony Music have continued to release hits compilations with Az√∫car Moreno all through the 2000s, such as Toda La Pasi√≥n De Az√∫car Moreno (2001), Colecci√≥n De Oro (2002), 20 Grandes Exitos (2003), Los Esenciales (2003) and 20 Exitos Originales (2005) as well as numerous mid- price collections, none of these include any new recordings or tracks not to be found on their three subsequent studio albums for the Sony label, several of the duo's greatest hits do however appear in edited form. Mucho Az√∫car - Grandes √âxitos was in 1999 re-released with slightly revised cover art but with the same track list under the title 20th Anniversary (1979-1999) as the Sony Latin label, originally CBS-Epic Latin, celebrated its 20th anniversary.

He played live for the most part, but he recorded with songwriter Peter Lack, and he appears in a Replacements video, \\"When It Began,\\" which received two 1991 MTV Video Music Awards nominations. Foley replaced founding member Chris Mars and toured Europe and the United States with the Replacements in support of their final album, All Shook Down, and played in their final show (prior to a reunion in 2013), which took place on July 4, 1991, in Chicago's Grant Park. Minneapolis bands Foley grew up in the Hopkins, Minnesota area with six siblings who were all interested in music. He played for the Overtones and Things That Fall Down who were among the favorites of Kevin Cole then of First Avenue, and with the Suprees, Snaps, Routine 11, Bang Zoom and Trailer Trash. Foley was a drummer for Curtiss A for ten years when he most likely did not record on Twin/Tone Records. The Replacements Two members of Curtiss A bands replaced two members of The Replacements. Bob Dunlap, now known as \\"Slim,\\" replaced guitarist Bob Stinson, who was fired in 1986 after the tour for Tim and died at age 35 in 1995. Foley replaced drummer and painter Chris Mars, who left the band in 1990. Westerberg and Tommy Stinson went out looking for a drummer in 1990, decided on Foley, who was willing, and asked him to drive them all to an audition. They skipped the audition, which became their first practice together when their just-released album All Shook Down happened to be in his car's CD player‚Äîloudly when Foley turned on the ignition. The band as well as observers knew at the time that it was self-destructing. Foley first played with The Replacements publicly for First Avenue's twentieth anniversary. After seeing him play with this band at the Orpheum Theatre, his father finally decided that Foley was a professional musician. Starting in January 1991, The Replacements toured Europe for Warner Bros.' Sire Records for All Shook Down as the opening act for Elvis Costello. But their review in New YorkPareles who loved Westerberg thought Dunlap and Foley were a separate band just playing along. was poor and they broke up, perhaps because Westerberg was in pursuit of a solo career, or they just quit. At number 69 (Don't Tell a Soul reached 57) on the Billboard 200, All Shook Down was The Replacements' second-best-selling album. It received four stars from Rolling Stone who called The Replacements \\"America's best band\\". Allmusic didn't like it but gave the album four and a half stars, and, undated, appears to predict the band's breakup. Early on The Replacements refused to make videos but later made commercial videos for Sire and MTV. Approximately at the time of Foley's tenure, \\"Merry-Go-Round\\" with a supporting video with Mars on drums reached number 1, \\"When It Began\\" with a clay animation video with Foley on drums reached number 4, and \\"Someone Take the Wheel\\" reached 15 on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks. When Warner's Rhino released four early Replacements albums from Twin/Tone in April 2008, Stinson and Westerberg discussed a reunion in Billboard. Westerberg was in favor of waiting for the reissues of the four Sire albums later that year. Which drummer they had in mind might be unknown. Stinson had praised Foley's work which was on beat rather than behind it like Mars. Westerberg was impressed initially that Foley knew so much of The Replacements' material but also criticized him as he did most of his bandmates. Josh Freese played drums and Mars contributed backup vocals but not drums on a Rhino compilation in 2005. Practice in October 2008 was with Michael Bland. Later years After the Replacements disbanded, Foley joined his brother Kevin in Tommy Stinson's new group, Bash & Pop, which released one album, Friday Night Is Killing Me (1993). In 1997 Foley recorded Something Wonderful with Peter Lack in the band 69, later known as Wheelo. Foley married in 2007 and lived in south Minneapolis. His across-the-street neighbor was Chris Mars; they both owned BMW motorcycles.

Early years Gardiner was born in Penola, South Australia. She attended primary school in Victoria. Her secondary education was undertaken in Victoria and then in New South Wales. After leaving school, she obtained a Bachelor of Business through the Mitchell College of Advanced Education in Bathurst, New South Wales, now part of Charles Sturt University. National Party political activity Gardiner commenced her working life as a junior clerk working in a legal office in Tamworth where she played an active role in the Young Australian Country Party ‚Äì NSW (YACP ‚Äì NSW) ‚Äì the NSW youth branch of the Party now known as the Young Nationals. Gardiner worked her way up to become State Secretary of the YACP ‚Äì NSW and was elected as a delegate to the Central Council of the Australian Country Party ‚Äì NSW in the mid-1970s. Gardiner moved to Sydney and began work at the New South Wales headquarters of the then Australian Country Party as a research officer working under the leadership of Colonel Bill Ford OBE, general secretary and then as Executive Officer to Charles Blunt, general secretary. She was eventually to become the General Secretary of the NSW Branch of the National Party of Australia between 1984 and 1991 and the first woman to hold that position. During her term as General Secretary of the NSW National Party, at the request of the National Party Federal Leader, Doug Anthony, Gardiner undertook an analysis of the implications of a Hawke Labor Government proposal in 1984 to increase the number of Members in the Australian House of Representatives. The Opposition Coalition was formally opposed to the proposal. Gardiner's analysis indicated that the National Party could benefit from an expanded House and National Party Senators crossed the floor to vote with Labor in support of the motion. Gardiner was also influential in persuading the Liberal Party to avoid three- cornered contests in country NSW seats. During the failed 1987 Joh for Canberra campaign to install Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen as Prime Minister, in a highly unusual move for a paid party official, Gardiner issued a media release critical of the Queensland National Party. Gardiner was general secretary when the NSW National Party achieved its most successful post-WWII outcome at the NSW general elections held on 19 March 1988 when the party won 20 out of 26 seats contested in the Legislative Assembly that swept the Unsworth Labor Government from office. In an unpublished manuscript, Gardiner has written about the history of the NSW Young Nationals. New South Wales state political career Gardiner was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council on 25 May 1991 replacing the Honourable Judy Jakins, MLC. She was re- elected to the Council in both 1999 and 2007 and had the fifth highest quota in both elections. She was number two on the Liberal/Nationals election ticket and since 31 March 2003 was the Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Legislative Council. In Parliament, she served on the following committees: *General Purpose Standing Committee 2 *Privileges Committee *Procedure Committee *Committee on the Independent Commission Against Corruption (2003‚Äì2007) *Temporary Chair of Committees (2003‚Äì2007) *Select Committee on Electoral and Political Party Funding (2007‚Äì2008) *Joint Select Committee Upon Gun Law Reform (1991) that drafted gun control laws On 16 February 2014 Gardiner announced she would be retiring at the 2015 election.

History  The academy traces its origin to the Cadet Training Unit of Bangladesh which was formed in November 1973. In April 1977 it was moved to Jashore and renamed Cadet Training Wing. On April 1982 it was made a full academy and renamed Bangladesh Air Force Academy.  Selection of officers  View of BAF Information and Selection Centre, Dhaka Suitable candidates are selected after passing through different selection phases. For regular courses of different branch cadets, the selection procedure is as follows: # Preliminary written Test on IQ, English, Physics & Mathematics. # Preliminary VIVA & Medical Test. # ISSB board for four days. # Final Medical Test # Final Interview at Air HQ. The certificate award ceremony of Bangladesh Air Force Academy graduates Selection criteria for BAF candidates are highest among armed forces branches and only the best candidates are selected as air force cadets.  Training system  Newly recruited cadets undergo three years of training before they receive a commission. Initially, BAF cadets join the Bangladesh Military Academy for a tenure of three months, where they undergo initial training with army and navy cadets. Following initial training, they return to their academy and join the Bangladesh Air Force Academy. At the academy, cadets receive general service training, armed combat training and education on different service-related subjects. The period at the academy is divided into four terms. For the first two terms, cadets only receive general service training and read service-related subjects. During the third term, the General Duties Branch cadets go for 120 hours basic flying training and other branches' cadets begin studying subjects such as engineering. After successful completion of three years training in the Bangladesh Air Force Academy, cadets are commissioned into different branches of the Bangladesh Air Force. Those branches are General Duty (Pilot) ([GD(P)]), Maintenance (Technical Engineering), Maintenance (Technical Communication and Electronics), Maintenance (Technical Armament), Air Defence Weapon Control (ADWC), Logistics, Administration, Air Traffic Control (ATC), Education, Legal, Accounts, Meteorology, etc. A flight cadet also earns a BSc degree in Aeronautics from the Bangladesh University of Professionals.

History Prehistory left There is evidence of human presence from the paleolithic period, roughly 700,000-500,000 years ago. Flint axe heads were found near Hallow in the 1970s. Toponym In the 9th century the toponym was recorded as Halhegan, Heallingan and Halnegan. In the 11th century it was recorded as Halhegan and Hallhagan, while in the 13th century it was Hallawe, Hallaye or Hallag.Victoria County History, 1913, pages 367-372 Manor The earliest record of the manor of Hallow is from AD 816, during the reign of Coenwulf of Mercia, when Hallow evidently belonged to Worcester Cathedral, and by the 10th century Hallow belonged to the Benedictine priory attached to the cathedral. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries around 1540 the cathedral retained Hallow, and in 1913 the manor was vested in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. By the middle of the 11th century Worcester Priory had fishponds at Hallow and in 1256 permission was granted for a warren as well. Both were still in use in 1346. The Domesday Book records that in 1086 Hallow had two mills for grinding grain: presumably watermills on the River Severn. Hallow Mill was still in use in 1913. Parish church Until 1876 Hallow was a chapelry of Grimley. Hallow's original chapel of ease was demolished in 1830 and replaced by a modest Georgian chapel on a new site about south-east of the old one. In 1867 the second chapel was demolished and building began of the present Church of England parish church of Saint Philip and Saint James. It was designed by W.J. Hopkins and completed in 1869.Pevsner, 1968, page 182 Hallow was made a separate parish in 1876. The bell tower with its high broach spire were added in 1879. The church is W.J. Hopkins' most notable work. The nave and clerestorey are of four bays and are flanked by north and south aisles. The clerestorey is supported by flying buttresses and, like a number of Hopkins' works, has round windows. The chancel and its arch are impressively high. 17th and 18th century memorial tablets from the old chapel were preserved and are mounted in the new church. The old chapel had three bells in 1552 and five in 1740. A 16th-century bell from the old chapel hung in the new church until 1900, when a new peal of eight bells cast by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough was hung in the tower. Notable people Colonel William Careless, who preserved the life of Charles II by hiding him in the Royal Oak (1651), was resident in Hallow during the 1680s. The manufacturer and philanthropist William Morris (1877-1963), the future Viscount Nuffield, was born in Hallow and baptised at SS Philip and James. The diplomat, archeologist, explorer and historian Stewart Perowne was born in Hallow in 1901. Sir Charles Bell (1774-1842) died in Hallow en route from Edinburgh to London and is buried in the churchyard.http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf References Sources Villages in Worcestershire ","title":"Hallow, Worcestershire"},{"id":"19131028","text":"Diego Col√≥n de Toledo y Pravia, 4th Admiral of the Indies (died 28 January 1578) was a paternal grandson of Diego Col√≥n and his wife Mar√≠a de Toledo y Rojashttp://www.geneall.net/H/per_page.php?id=52941 Diego Col√≥n de Toledo, making him a great-grandson of Christopher Columbus.

It is found in Northern Africa, Asia and Europe.  Biology  This is a large heavy moth with a wingspan of 68‚Äì96 mm. The wings are greyish brown and marked with fine dark cross lines. The moth flies from April to August depending on the location. The caterpillars have a red/purple stripe across the back and a black head. They reach a length of 9‚Äì10 cm. The caterpillars feed in the trunks and branches of a wide variety of trees (see list below), taking three to five years to mature. The caterpillar holes can be found low on the stem (maximum 1.0‚Äì1.5 cm above the ground). When ready to pupate the caterpillar leaves the tree to find a suitable spot. The species prefer humid environments. As a food Pliny reported in Natural History that a grub which he gives the name cossus was considered a Roman delicacy after it was fed with flour. Some writers have equated this with Cossus cossus, but Pliny specifies that his cossus is found in oak trees, which makes this identification unlikely. Pliny's cossus is more likely to have been the larva of the beetle Cerambyx heros. F. S.

These nanoparticles consist of small stacks of graphene that are 1 to 15 nanometers thick, with diameters ranging from sub-micrometre to 100 micrometres. The X-ray diffractogram of this material would resemble that of graphite, in that the 002 peak would still appear at ~26o 2 theta. However, the peak would appear considerably smaller and broader. These features indicate that the interplanar distance in exfoliated graphite is similar to that of the parent graphite, but the stack size (of graphene layers) is small. Since xGnP is composed of the same material as carbon nanotubes, it shares many of the electrochemical characteristics, although not the tensile strength. The platelet shape, however, offers xGnP edges that are easier to modify chemically for enhanced dispersion in polymers. Composite materials made with polymers, like plastics, nylon, or rubber, can be made electrically or thermally conductive with the addition of small amounts of xGnP. These nanoparticles can change the fundamental properties of plastics, enabling them to perform more like metals with metallic properties. These new nanoparticles also improve barrier properties, modulus, and surface toughness when used in composites. Properties Graphene is extremely electrically conductive material. In turn, xGnP has a percolation threshold for conductivity of 1.9 wt% in thermoplastic matrix. At densities of 2‚Äì5 wt%, conductivity reaches sufficient levels to provide electromagnetic shielding. xGnP can also be combined with glass fibers or other matrix materials to provide sufficient conductivity for electrostatic painting or other applications requiring electrical conductivity. xGnP significantly outperforms most other forms of carbon in terms of thermal conductivity when used at densities of 20 wt% in control resins. At these densities, xGnP also confers significant electrical conductivity as well as improved mechanical properties to most thermoplastic, thermoset, or elastomeric systems. At lesser densities, xGnP adds thermal stability to a variety of matrix materials. As opposed to materials like carbon black, xGnP improves mechanical properties of most composites, particularly stiffness and tensile strength. Elastomeric compounds have been shown to experience increased life and reduced surface wear when reinforced with xGnP. Because of the platelet shape, xGnP significantly improves the impermeability of composites when used at densities of ~3 wt% or greater. xGnP particles can be aligned using electric field, although alignment is not necessary for use in most extrusion systems. Because xGnP also imparts electrical conductivity at these densities, the resulting composites offer attractive cost savings for applications like fuel lines or fuel tank linings.

The body of the larva is yellowish white with two purplish-brown lines on the back. Head is light brown. Ecology The moth flies from May to July depending on the location. The larvae feed on Phragmites australis, Phragmites communis, Phragmites gigantea and Phragmites pumila.Cossidae of Israel After larva hatching in summer, it feeds first in shoot tips. After two moults, larva enter a base internode. Larvae pupate after two years within shoots. As a pest Larva severely devastate the shoot tips. The point it emerges is completely eaten first through and few internodes below the growing point are packed with frass, results so called \\"dead heart\\". Feeding on shoot bases by more developed larva is indistinct. Leaves may yellow and wilt from shoot base. They are known to attack Saccharum officinarum, Saccharum spontaneum and Sorghum propineum. In control processes, seed cuttings are often treated with hot water at 50 ¬∞C for two hours. Dry leaves are removed before shipment when they moved to pest-free area. According to integrated pest management, pest resistant varieties are cultivated. In biological methods, Tumidiclava species can be introduced to the field, but it may be adapted to these predators.

It is a sequel to the 1998's film Money No Enough, which also directed by local celebrity director Jack Neo. Plot The three brothers of the mother of Yang were having a hot pot after caught in a traffic jam on separate locations. While stuck in the traffic, Bao Huang and Bao Qiang were separately criticising on the Electronic Road Pricing gantries. Bao Hui was curious on the Caring Pollen supplement which Bao Huang took and how he make profits, and mentioned Bao Qiang's estate agent helped him earned over millions; Bao Qiang wife, Lingling, however, warned about the risks on making a large investment and handling on losses if unsuccessful. The next day, Hui was awarded shopping vouchers and a reflexology package after working as an employer for 30 years but suddenly reflecting on the deeds he done. He then attended a conference hosted by Huang and commemorate one of his manager, Chen Guan Sai, for making profits. Shortly after, Huang introduced Hui the job, but he visited his mother Yang who gave her $10,000 of her life savings from a tin of Cream crackers and promises to return when he have enough. Qiang's daughter, Stella, took part in the audition for a singing competition and was introduced by the daughter of Qiang's employee; concerning that her size would lose the competition, he then bribed other auditionees by giving money, but the organiser forces them out of the site when they were caught. Huang's wife, Yanyan, brought Yang to a local polyclinic; the doctor inform that Yang had a history of diabetes and her body having fat lumps, which explains why Yang felt tired often. Yanyan asked to arrange the doctor for a scan, but was opposed by Huang due to time constraints. After a few days of work, Hui was promoted to a manager by Huang and purchases a panel van, and eventually able to repay the money to Yang. Eventually, his profits helped his wife Xiuyun and his family to purchase other necessities such as a MioTV pay television and watching Singapore Grand Prix live. Huang was caught in a police for speeding in Pan Island Expressway; initially waving the demerit points to Yang, the police asked Yang to drive one round of the entire carpark, but when she was unable to do so, Yanyan covers up by telling she was the driver and was escorted to the police station; their relationship began to strain and noted that Huang had visited in a nightclub following her arrest. Shortly after, they were prosecuted in a court, but not long before they met Hui who also visit the court to sue the carpark management after they were issued a summon; when the couple asked the motor officer why they were fined, the officer told that they have left a car in a season parking lot after 10pm during Sunday nights on a white-coloured lot, which was a visitor parking lot before 10pm, further they have a language barrier. Their appeal was unsuccessful and were possibly charged for contempt. After Huang encourages Hui to cheer up, Hui took his friends for a lunch before seeing a news broadcast that about tens of patients who were admitted to hospital showed signs of poisoning due to the supplements; Hui, seeing the broadcast, debunked that the supplements were imitations. Hui called Huang to sought help but was taken by the mob somewhere to watch a viral YouTube video uploaded by Chen on promoting the supplements. An infuriated Huang called Chen to explain the matter, Chen revealed that he have borrowed $80,000 cash from the loan shark to initiate a business, and now demanding him to pay $100,000 as the $20,000 increase was due to the interests. Huang hangs up his phone, angering Chen and vowed to take action the next time they meet. Ridiculed by the large stocks of supplements in separate places, Hui and Huang confronted on the plans to dispose all the supplements before they were encountered by a mob of their employers, impatiently losing trust; Huang told the employers to trust them wait for a while for the laboratory results to be released. Soon after, Huang rejected Chen's phone call but decided to call Hui's friend, Mindy, for an invite; it was later revealed to be a trap set by Chen, and offered Huang to swallow a bowl of supplements as proof, but ended up in a scrawl and beaten up by Chen's henchman, before dismisses Huang by demanding a $100,000 payment as soon as possible. Separately, Qiang lodged a police report when the lawyer representative took the money from the client, not before they received another phone call informing that their en-bloc sales failed after their committees have rejected his project proposal. To no avail, they were unable to pay their mortgage loan for the bungalow and ended up unable to keep both the house and his car, and eventually settled to a house flat instead, much to Stella's chagrin. The three brothers converged in a coffee shop to discuss their next course of action to try to rack up money; however their efforts was to no success. After meeting up again, the brothers saw Hui got a sum of money, which was actually retrieved from Yang because of the scent of the crackers. After Yang gave her entire life savings to the brothers, she was depressed but continued to met her friends by acting as beggars, but shortly taken to custody when Yang begs for money to a Social worker. After the brothers learned on her misdeed and took her home, Yang suddenly collapses and was warded to a hospital. A doctor informed that Yang was still recuperating in a hospital and was discharged the day after. Pressured by Chen's debt, Yanyan gave a $100,000 cheque to Huang and able to repay the debts, and shortly he and Hui were able to dispose the supplement stocks safely, before Hui had to give up his van, but not long the officers of Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau paid them a visit to Huang's house and ask to bring Yanyan for investigation. Huang initially denied the claim that Yanyan done something wrong, but Yanyan revealed that the $100,000 cheque was not from her father as mentioned earlier, but actually came from one of the company's funds; Huang scolded Yanyan for anyhow misusing the funds and asked the officers to arrest her as soon as possible, before lamenting him as a \\"smart aleck\\" and the fact he learnt that money is not enough. Yanyan was eventually jailed for a year when the court pleaded her guilty for embezzlement. Shortly after the arrest, Huang and Hui began their fresh jobs as a taxi driver and a cleaner respectively, while Qiang continued his en-bloc sales, happily settling their new lives. Qiang was able to rack up at least $300,000 for the sales, and some more money for Ling and Stella's involvement in a getai concert as Ghost Festival was underway. Hui and their family noticed Yang urinated whenever she goes, then he raised concerns to the brothers on deciding who to be the caretaker for the week; the brother decided to rotate caretaker for a week but each one of the brothers facing issues (Huang was bothered by Yang in the dead of the night asking to help her find a certain coloured bra; Hui was due to being bothered by her same questions due to short-term memory; Qiang and her family was concerned on the rooms deciding where to let Yang to sleep, which also raises concerns from Stella). After a week for each, the brothers decided to let Hui bring Yang to a retirement home; after Yang seeing Hui ran off, she collapses in shock and was warded to the hospital's intensive care unit. A shocked Hui blames Huang and Qiang for the idea and criticises them, and now further worried on the expenditure in the hospital. Concerning on the spending, the trio negotiated with the hospital's management to downsize the class, but the management refuses because of the current condition and the risks involved. Huang saw his friend brought joss sticks and papers to burn to his father-in-law, explaining the burden of paying money in hospital and hopefully to send the person off. The brothers then received a talisman to burn in-front of Yang, and Hui had to burn because he is the eldest of the three, but a frightened Qiang stopped the burning because they could not bear the loss of Yang; coincidentally, the monitor bleep and the nurse asked the brothers, and Xiuyun, who observed the burning, to wait outside. Meanwhile, Lingling, Stella and the singers were involved in a car accident while Lingling was neglected on the driving, and Stella was heavily injured because she was not equipped in a seat belt due to a singer asking her to take a front seat because of the stockings, causing her body to fly out off the front panel. Lingling called Qiang to rush to the A&E; department and the brothers do so. A doctor informed that both Yang and Stella were in critical condition and requires blood to undergo surgery, and both patients share the same blood type of O-; there were two O- blood bags left and is currently given to a patient while transporting a new supply of bags would take time. They revealed Qiang and Lingling share the same blood type and were eligible to donate blood, but they were unable to do so due to separate reasons (Qiang was due to the poor liver system, and Lingling was anemic); when Qiang asked if the patient who need the bag was Yang, the doctor was unsure but hesitantly confirms it, which cause the couple to criticise Hui and Huang over saving an elder's instead of a young. Lingling then raced to Yang's ward to snatch a box of blood bags, but were stopped by the brothers and led to another argument, having difficulty on who to save, despite Qiang emphasizes that both were loved ones. Yang, who overheard the argument, began to cry before going on to pull the life support to end her life, shocking everyone on the scene. A doctor then pronounced her dead shortly afterwards. Seven weeks following Yang's funeral, the family visited for another pot dinner while praying Yang to repent for the deeds and told that they have learned a lesson on money, while thanking her for winning the first prize in a 4D lottery as forgiveness, with the winning number based on the registration number of the van which used for the transport of her coffin. Yanyan, who was released from the prison after the funeral, explained that she was absent and told her that she was the best mother, and eventually able to reconcile with Huang. Stella also thanked Yang for making the sacrifice. While they were eating, Huang introduced a safely-tested Supifen bark powder supplement, and eventually able to rebound on their fortunes quickly. During the credits, Huang met his friends and discussing on the parking coupons. Mini-sequel Following the events of Money No Enough 2, the brothers paid a visit to Yang during the Ghost Festival and began complaining about their poor finance performances and accusing that she was not assisting them supernaturally. Cast The main characters of the movie were played by the following actors: *Henry Thia as Yang Baohui The eldest brother of the Yang family who was a dedicated company worker for 30 years before working as a company introduced by Baohuang. Sometimes smart but also quirky solving issues. The last name Hui was based on the last name of Thia. *Jack Neo as Yang Baoqiang The second brother of Yang who owns a luxurious BMW X3 and a bungalow, due to the large profits that he got from the resulting sales as an estate agent. Qiang was quick and decisive on solving questions especially handling money problems, notably after the time when he lives in a HDB flat. The last name Qiang was based on the last name of Neo. *Mark Lee as Yang Baohuang The third brother of Yang who is a company manager. Huang was arrogant and sleazy but care among the brothers the most, and an experienced driver. The last name Huang was based on the last name of Lee. *Lai Meng as Mother Yang The mother of the three brothers of Yang, who she have a record of diabetes and began displaying signs and symptoms throughout the course of the film. Yang was also much kindred to the three brothers on the actions and remain loyal. *Anna Lin Ruping as Xiuyun The wife of the eldest brother Baohui, who sometimes care the most for Baohui and has three daughters. *Choo Lingling as Lingling The wife of Baoqiang, who she was also a spendthrift but conservative, providing keen advices to Qiamg whenever he need. *Natalie Ong as Stella Yang The only child of Baoqiang who she was a passionate singer. She likes to live in a lap of luxury and dislikes adapting in an normal life once they settled in a HDB flat. *Vivian Lai as Zhou Yanyan The wife of Baohuang and the caregiver of the house. Yanyan was also sometimes protective and truthful to Baohuang but their relationship find it hard to get a firm ground. *John Cheng as Chen Guan Sai An employee worked under Baohuang and a former loan shark. Additional cameos include then-Member of Parliament Michael Palmer, and future MP David Ong who appeared in a scene serving as members-of-parliament for Yang Baoqiang. Other actors also appearing the film include Wang Lei, Michelle Choo and Huang Bihua as singers in a Getai scene, and CK Cheong in another scene. Sequel In April 2020, an online live session between Jack Neo and Mark Lee hinted the possible sequel for the Money No Enough 2 and are currently writing the script for the upcoming sequel Money No Enough 3. The filming was initially planned to begin in September 2020, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. Jack stated that the film concept in the third film series will be a departure from the previous films as he implied that the people‚Äôs perception to the money and the concept of the money has been changed.

It was built by the Marescotti family in the 12th century. It was the house of Count Galgano Lucarini Saracini and then it became property of Fabio Chigi Lucarini Saracini. The palace is described as a \\"Gothic beauty with a curved facade and back courtyard.\\" History The atrium of the palace with the statue of pope Julius III by Fulvio Signorini. Photo by Paolo Monti, 1965. In the mid-twelfth century, the aristocratic Marescotti family of Siena, owners of a castle at the site, erected the tower that stands today next to the palace. Their emblem (an eagle with outstretched wings) is visible on the trefoil windows of the facade. Subsequent reconstructions led to the Gothic structure visible now. In 1506, the Piccolimini-Mandoli family acquired the building and refurbished the palace interiors, cortile, and loggia in a Renaissance style. In 1770, the owner Marcantonio Saracini undertook a restoration of the building that lasted until 1824, when Galgano, his son, inherited it. Preserving the original Gothic fa√ßade, the castle matches the characteristic curvature of this narrow medieval street. The interior was renovated and modernized by Agostino Fantastici, and art collections were added. In 1877, after Galagano Saracini died, the palace was inherited by Fabio Saracini, who died in a hunting accident, passing the castle on to his nephew Guido. Count Guido Chigi Saracini, the castle's last owner, restored the building's exterior and interior with the help of architect Arturo Viligiardi (especially the rococo- style concert hall). In 1932, he founded the Chigiana music academy, to which he bequeathed the building after his death in 1965.

According to estimates by members of the community, the Chinese in Bulgaria number around 5,000, although Bulgarian researchers put the figure at around 10,000. Chinese are among the most recent immigrants to Bulgaria, the vast majority of them arriving after the democratic changes in 1989, and particularly from 1992 on; prior to 1989, only a dozen Chinese lived in Bulgaria. Most Chinese in Bulgaria are economic immigrants and small-scale investors in particular. The bulk of the Chinese live in the capital Sofia, particularly in the municipality of Nadezhda and its neighbourhoods of Nadezhda, Tolstoy and Svoboda. Although there is no discernible Chinatown, it is thought that one might develop in the following years. Most of the Chinese were urban dwellers in China, a large number coming from the provinces of Zhejiang and Fujian, with fewer from Sichuan, Shandong, Jilin, Beijing and Hong Kong. According to the media, 2,0003,000 Chinese immigrate to Bulgaria every year. However, with the financial turmoil in the EU and Bulgaria, this figure has greatly decreased. The most typical and indeed most visible occupation of the Bulgarian Chinese is the management of Chinese restaurants, although they are also known as shopkeepers (with a permanent presence in Sofia's large and frequented bazaar Iliyantsi), engaging in both retail and wholesale trade. Some have also been involved in agriculture, for example producing and selling Chinese cabbage. Traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese art are also very popular. As many Chinese come from Southern China, they speak a variety of dialects (such as Min) in addition to Mandarin Chinese. Among the main factors attracting Chinese to Bulgaria is the lower competition enabling more economic opportunities for the immigrants, the availability of more personal space and the lack of a one- child policy. The Chinese in Bulgaria come from a variety of religious and cultural backgrounds; the majority are atheist, but there are also Buddhists, Confucians, Taoists, Christians, Jehovah's Witnesses, etc. The Chinese New Year is celebrated among family circles. A magazine called Kitay (\\"China\\") is issued by the community in Bulgarian. The People's Republic of China has had diplomatic relations with Bulgaria since 3 October 1949: Bulgaria was the second country in the world to recognize the PRC and has not recognized the Republic of China (Taiwan). The PRC has an embassy in Sofia, which used to be located in the Yablanski House.

The University Library has won The Times Higher Leadership and Management Award for the Outstanding Library Team.  History  The library of Armstrong College, the precursor to Newcastle University, was on the third floor of what is now the Armstrong Building, before moving to a larger room on the first floor in 1906. In 1926 the library moved into a new building on the other side of the quadrangle, which also housed the libraries of the Royal Victoria Infirmary and the Medical College which eventually merged with Armstrong College. A substantial extension to this building in 1960 was quickly outgrown by the library, which from 1963 served the new University of Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1982 a new library building opened on Jesmond Road West, occupying ground cleared during the construction of the Newcastle Central Motorway in the early 1970s. It was named the Robinson Library in 1989 and re-named the Philip Robinson Library in 2016. The building was extended in 1996 to provide additional study space and a large computer cluster. In 2014 a Pop-Up Library was launched in the King's Road Centre to provided additional study space during the summer exam period, and the Pop-Up Library returned during exam periods until the opening of the Marjorie Robinson Library Rooms in January 2016.  Philip Robinson Library  The Philip Robinson Library is the main library for Newcastle University, and is located on Jesmond Road West. It was named after Philip Robinson, a bookseller in the city and benefactor to the library, in 1989. The subsequent ¬£8 million bequest in the will of his widow Marjorie remains the largest sum donated to a UK university library. The library was initially known simply as the Robinson Library until 2016, when it was renamed as the Philip Robinson Library to distinguish it from the new Marjorie Robinson Library Rooms. The library allows students and members to access a wide variety of material, including: * Special Collections: spanning from the mid-15th century to the 21st century, the special collection includes over one hundred rare books, manuscripts, illustrations and woodblocks. * E-Journals and databases: access to electronic journals and databases allowing students to access research papers and journals from a large number of sources. * Books and papers: over one million books and twenty six thousand periodicals are available, and access is given to Parliamentary papers and journal collection. * Computer access: the Philip Robinson Library has four computer clusters available with over two hundred computers. The Philip Robinson Library had a large refurbishment which was completed in 2009. Another refurbishment followed in 2012. The Philip Robinson Library also has its own computer cluster, as well as an open working space for students, named \\"Your Space\\". There is also a printing and bindery office for both commercial and student use. In 2018 the Special Collections service housed in the library was awarded Archive Service Accreditation.  Walton Library  The Walton Library, located in the Medical School on Framlington Place, specialises in texts and resources relating to biomedical sciences, although students of any discipline are allowed to use it for study. It is named after Lord Walton of Detchant, former Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and Professor of Neurology. The library has a relationship with the Northern region of the NHS allowing their staff to use the library for research and study. In addition to book loans and computer access, the Walton Library also has a number or workstations connected for NHS users to access databases and journals.  Law Library  Located in Newcastle Law School on Windsor Terrace, the Law Library specialises in providing texts for law students, although students from all disciplines may use it. Specialised student text collections exist for books that are heavily in demand, and a computer cluster is also available.

British National Vegetative Classification The main British National Vegetation Classification communities associated with purple moor grass and rush pastures include M23 (Juncus effusus/acutiflorus-Galium palustre rush pasture), M25 (Molinia caerulea-Potentilla erecta mire), M26 (Molinia caerulea-Crepis paludosa mire) and British NVC community MG10 (Holco- Juncetum effusi rush-pasture). Threats *Drainage *Cultivation *Fertiliser application *Overgrazing *Frequent burning *Undergrazing - leading to succession to scrub and woodland. Can become dominated by soft rush (Juncus effusus) *Afforestation Management Natural England Guidance advocates an average grass height of for rush during April and May, increasing to in June to October, a quarter of the sward no more than for grass and for rushes - a diverse sward of shorter areas interspersed by taller tussocks.29-31 Areas of dense litter are beneficial to over-wintering insects and small mammals, but should be less than 25% of the total area in October. Protection In the UK there are a number of initiatives to help prevent deterioration and to restore these sites. These include designation as Site of Special Scientific Interest, national nature reserves, voluntary entry into the Environmental Stewardship Scheme by landowners, or work by voluntary conservation organisations such as the Devon Wildlife Trust. The largest area of Culm grassland in Devon is Hare's Down, Knowstone & Rackenford Moors near Rackenford and is owned by Devon Wildlife Trust. Their management regime includes controlled burning in winter and light grazing by cattle in the summer. The aim is to control the amounts of scrub and bracken without removing them completely.

Early years and education Leadbeater was born in Ballitore, Athy, County Kildare, Ireland. She was the daughter of Richard Shackleton (1726‚Äì1792) by his second wife, Elizabeth Carleton, and granddaughter of Abraham Shackleton, schoolmaster of Edmund Burke. Her parents were Quakers. She was thoroughly educated, and her literary studies were aided by Aldborough Wrightson, a man of great ability who had been educated at Ballitore school and had returned to die there. In 1784 she travelled to London with her father and paid several visits to Burke's town house, where she met Sir Joshua Reynolds and George Crabbe. She also went to Beaconsfield, and on her return wrote a poem in praise of the place and its owner, which was acknowledged by Burke, 13 December 1784, in a long and eulogistic letter.Leadbeater, M. (1862), Annals of Ballitore, p. 145 On her way home she visited, at Selby, Yorkshire, some primitive Quakers whom she described in her journal. Career In 1791 she married William Leadbeater, a former pupil of her father, and they resided in Ballitore. Leadbeater, who traced his descent from the Huguenot family of Le Batre, was a small farmer and landowner, and his wife kept the village post office. On her father's death, Leadbeater received a tender letter of consolation from Burke.Leadbeater, M. (1862), p. 200 She had from time to time written poems, and in 1794 published anonymously in Dublin Extracts and Original Anecdotes for the Improvement of Youth, which begins with \\"some account of the society of the people call Quakers\\", contains several poems on secular subjects, and concludes with \\"divine odes\\". She was in Carlow on Christmas Day 1796 when the news arrived that the French fleet had been seen off Bantry, and she describes the march out of the troops. On 28 May 1797 Burke wrote one of his last letters to her.Leadbeater, M. (1862), p. 218 Ballitore was occupied in 1798 first by yeomanry, \\"from whose bosom,\\" wrote Mary Leadbeater, \\"pity seemed banished.\\"Annals of Ballitore, Vol. 1, pp. 244‚Äì249 Next came the quartering of soldiers on the town, the Suffolk Fencibles and the Ancient Britons, who commenced torturing and flogging the inhabitants.Annals of Ballitore, Vol. 1, p. 227 \\"The village, once so peaceful, exhibited a scene of tumult and dismay; and the air rang with the shrieks of the sufferers, and the lamentations of those who beheld them suffer,\\" she wrote. A force of about 300 rebels then occupied the town and carried out reprisals, but who fled the following day on the approach of a force of soldiers. These soldiers in turn exacted reprisals on the locals, even killing the local doctor, Johnston. Mary Leadbeater wrote of the killing of her friend: \\"He was alone and unarmed when seized, and I believe had never raised his hand to injure any one.\\" The soldiers sacked the town, burned many houses and smashed up the rest, and one of them almost killed Mary Leadbeater, who had to flee with a number of other women. In 1808 she published Poems with a metrical version of her husband's prose translation of Maff√¶us Vegio's Thirteenth Book of the √Üneid. The poems are sixty-seven in number; six are on subjects relating to Burke, one in praise of the spa of Ballitore, and the remainder on domestic and local subjects. She next published in 1811 Cottage Dialogues among the Irish Peasantry, of which four editions, with some alterations and additions, had appeared by 1813. The dialogues are on such subjects as dress, a wake, going to the fair, a spinning match, cow-pock, cookery, and matrimony. William P. Le Fanu (1774‚Äì1817) had suggested the design, and the object was to diffuse information about the peasantry. In 1813 she tried to instruct the rich on a similar plan in The Landlord's Friend. Intended as a sequel to Cottage Dialogues, in which persons of quality are made to discourse on such topics as beggars, spinning-wheels, and Sunday in the village, Tales for Cottagers, which she brought out in 1814 in conjunction with Elizabeth Shackleton, is a return to the original design. The tales illustrate perseverance, temper, economy, and are followed by a curious moral play, Honesty is the best policy. In 1822 she concluded this series with Cottage Biography, being a Collection of Lives of the Irish Peasantry. The lives are those of real persons, and contain some interesting passages, especially in the life of James Dunn, a pilgrim to Loch Derg. Many traits of Irish country life appear in these books, and they preserve several of the idioms of the English-speaking inhabitants of the Pale. Memoirs and Letters of Richard and Elizabeth Shackleton ‚Ä¶ compiled by their Daughter was also issued in 1822 (new edition. 1849, edited by Lydia Ann Barclay). Her Biographical Notices of Members of the Society of Friends who were resident in Ireland appeared in 1823, and is a summary of their spiritual lives, with a scanty narrative of events. Her last work was The Pedlars, a Tale, published in 1824. Besides receiving letters from Burke, Leadbeater corresponded with, among others, Maria Edgeworth, George Crabbe, and Mrs Melesina Trench, and from the age of eleven kept a private journal. She died at Ballitore 27 June 1826, and was buried in the Quaker burial-ground there. She had several children, and one of her daughters, Mrs. Fisher, was the intimate friend of the poet and novelist Gerald Griffin. Leadbeater's best work, the Annals of Ballitore, was not printed till 1862, when it was brought out with the general title of The Leadbeater Papers (2 vols.) by Richard Davis Webb, a learned and patriotic printer, eager to preserve every truthful illustration of Irish life. It tells of the inhabitants and events of Ballitore from 1766 to 1823, and few books give a better idea of the character and feelings of Irish cottagers, of the premonitory signs of the rebellion of 1798, and of the horrors of the outbreak itself. The second volume includes unpublished letters of Burke and the correspondence with Mrs. Richard Trench and with Crabbe. References Sources * This entry lists: ** Smith, Joseph.

Early life She was born Lottie Adelina Preston in Carlisle, Cumberland on 23 January 1872 to parents George Matthew Tilbury (aka Preston) of Southampton and Anna de Lara. Her grandfather was David Laurent de Lara, a Dutch-born illumninator, who, according to Adelina de Lara, was the son of the Spanish Count Laurent de Lara. Her mother was the sister-in-law of Sir Landon Ronald. She was given the performing name of Adelina de Lara after a visit to a music shop with her father, to secure her first engagement. The music shop proprietor considered the name Adelina Preston far too ‚ÄòEnglish‚Äô to perform under and thus suggested her mother's maiden name as a suitable replacement. She first appeared in public at the age of six, and gave recitals throughout the UK until the age of twelve. Career She was educated at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt under Iwan Knorr, and studied piano with Fanny Davies and Clara Schumann, whose work she championed for most of her life. She was close friends with Johannes Brahms through her studies. As an adult, Adelina de Lara performed in public for the first time following her studies in 1891 and continued for over seventy years, making her final appearance on 15 June 1954 at the Wigmore Hall London. She made many recordings for the BBC and appeared on BBC Television on her 82nd birthday. During World War II she played for Dame Myra Hess at the National Gallery and later in life, Sir Adrian Boult. In 1951 Adelina was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). The late Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother was both an admirer and a friend and sent good wishes for concerts on many occasions. She also worked as a teacher, her students including Eileen Joyce and many other distinguished pianists. She composed many pieces which have included ballads, song cycles, some larger- scaled works as a symphony, a Concerto for Strings (1938) and a suite In The Forest (1949) and many works for piano including two concertos and a Symphonic Danse Fantasy for piano and Strings. There were also two suites for strings, including 'In The Forest', which was performed in 2005, in Gloucester Cathedral by the Gloucester Academy of Music.

The war lasted two years and de facto ended in 1218, but did not officially end until Theobald IV reached the age of majority in 1222, at which point his rivals abandoned their claims. Origins Blanche of NavarreIn 1190, Henry II, count of Champagne, left his county for the Crusades with his two uncles Philip II of France and Richard I of England (Henry's mother was the daughter of Louis VII of France and Eleanor of Aquitaine, and thus half-sister to Philip via her father and to Richard via her mother). He made the barons of Champagne swear to pay homage to his brother Theobald if he should die on Crusade. In the Holy Land, Henry was crowned king of Jerusalem and - to reinforce his legitimacy - married for the second time to queen Isabella, second wife and widow of Conrad of Montferrat, despite the fact that her first husband (from whom she had been forced to separate) was still alive. Henry and Isabella had three daughters and no surviving sons and so, when Henry II died in 1197, his brother inherited the county as Theobald III. Theobald III then died of a sudden illness four years later in 1201 while preparing to lead the Fourth Crusade, leaving his widow Blanche of Navarre nine months pregnant with their son Theobald IV, born after his father's death. In 1215 Henry II's third daughter Philippa of Champagne married a nobleman from Champagne living in the Holy Land. His name was Erard of Brienne-Ramerupt, and he was a cousin of John of Brienne, king of Jerusalem. It was he who gave Philippa the idea of claiming the county of Champagne. King Philip II's victory at BouvinesBlanche of Navarre, however, proved to be an incredibly strong and efficient regent, and had devoted herself for the past 15 years to ensuring the legal status of her son Theobald IV as rightful heir. Blanche was aided in securing her powerbase during the first few shakey years of her regency by the fact that so many lords and knights of the county, who might have posed a challenge to her, had left to fight on the Fourth Crusade from 1202 to 1204. Queen Mother Ad√®le of Champagne (who was Theobald III's aunt) also took Blanche under her wing, giving Blanche vital counsel during the early years of her regency until Ad√®le's death in 1206 (for the rest of her life, Blanche would make large monastic donations devoted to Ad√®le's memory). By 1216, despite the fact that Erard rallied most of the local barons of the county against Blanche, she had built up such strong alliances with both King Philip II as well as Pope Innocent III that Erard never gained any official legal support for his claims. From the start of the conflict, Pope Innocent III began excommunicating rebel barons, negatively affecting their efforts. Further, while Theobald IV was still an underaged youth of 13 years, he had acquitted himself so valiantly in combat at the decisive Battle of Bouvines that King Philip II threw his full support behind him (though this was also the culmination of over a decade of Blanche cementing an alliance with the monarchy, through financial ties and homage). Course Beginning Maneuvers (1216) Erard and Philippa landed in France in January 1216. On their journey to Le Puy-en-Velay, Erard was arrested by agents of the king of France but managed to escape and get to Champagne. Erard and his supporters took up a position in Noyers, which Blanche of Navarre then besieged in April 1216. That same month Erard accepted a truce and submitted the matter to the king of France for arbitration. In July 1216, King Philip II finally heard Erard's suit at Melun, but ruled in Blanche's favor due to the overwhelming evidence she provided: the barons of the realm had sworn to support Theobald III should Henry II not return from the Holy Land, Theobald III had done homage to the king in 1198, Blanche had done homage to the king in 1201, and Theobald IV himself had made an innovative \\"anticipatory homage\\" in 1214. Blanche even provided numerous letters patent, bearing the seals of the barons who had sworn homage. Philip II ordained that the barons await the majority of Theobald IV and his assumption of his rights as Count (when he turned 21 years old in May 1222). Philip II ordered Erard and the barons to seal their own letters patent confirming the court's decision and promising to observe a truce. Open Rebellion (1217) No sooner had Erard returned to his holdings in Champagne than he and his rebel supporters quickly broke the truce and took up arms against Blanche. In spring 1217 war began in earnest and the local barons of Champagne, all more or less supporting Philippa, abandoned Blanche to rally to Erard. Theobald I, Duke of Lorraine took on Erard's cause, as did his brother- in-law Miles, Seigneur de Noyers, and his nephew Andr√© de Pougy, Seigneur de Marolles-sur-Seine and de Saint Val√©rien. The support of the Duke of Lorraine added a substantial amount of strength to the rebel forces. Most of the fighting was concentrated in southeastern Champagne, as Blanche's forces pushed east from her capital at Troyes on the Seine river, to rebel fortresses on the Aube river (Erard's holding at Ramerupt north of Troyes) and further east on the Marne river (Joinville and Langres). Two of Blanche's most dangerous enemies were the brothers William and Simon of Joinville, both of whom broke peace treaties they had made with Blanche in 1214 to switch to Erard's side. Simon of Joinville was Blanche's own seneschal (though he had obtained the office through hereditary right, not appointment by Blanche). William was the bishop of Langres to the southeast, who also held overlordship of the county of Bar-sur-Aube. Apart from various sieges, during the early part of the conflict Erard and his rebel barons attacked merchant caravans traveling to the Champagne fairs at Troyes and Bar-sur-Aube. However, each side soon realized that they did not want to disrupt this vital source of monetary income. During the later years of the war, therefore, Erard would agree to truces with Blanche that would last weeks or months at a time, in order for the trade fairs to occur unmolested. In return, Blanche would pay off Erard with a large fraction of the revenue from the comital taxes exacted from the trade fairs. Foreign Intervention and Climax (1218) Emperor Frederick II The rebellion remained a localized affair, largely driven by the self-interest of the local barons, though by spring 1218 it attracted the intervention of Blanche's liege-lords King Philip II of France and Odo III, Duke of Burgundy, as well as Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. Duke Theobald I of Lorraine had sided with rival Holy Roman Emperor Otto IV against Frederick II during the recent round of civil wars in Germany, thus their entry on opposite sides of the conflict was an extension of Hohenstaufen-Welf antagonisms. Emperor Frederick II, the suzerain of Lorraine, considered it a felony for Duke Theobald I of Lorraine to support a candidate he opposed, so he occupied the city of Rosheim, which he had given to Theobald I's father. Theobald I responded in 1218, retaking Rosheim and then ravaging Alsace, particularly Frederick II's vineyards. Nonetheless Theobald I lost Rosheim again when a pro-Frederick II uprising in the city killed the Lorraine garrison (massacring them in their cellars after inviting them down to sample their wines). After two years, the papal excommunications and interdicts had also taken their toll, isolating the rebel barons. The Church's prelates in Champagne aided Blanche at the order of Pope Innocent III, with the notable exception of William, bishop of Langres, who ignored papal orders to excommunicate his own brother Simon. Blanche's forces ravaged the lands of her traitorous seneschal Simon of Joinville, and she imposed a humiliating surrender agreement: Simon's fortresses were seized, his eldest son Geoffroy was taken hostage, and Simon was forced to transfer his ancestral castle at Joinville to his brother Bishop William as security for his good conduct. The entry of Burgundy and Bar into the war began to turn the tide against the rebels. With the aid of Odo III of Burgundy and Count Henry II of Bar, Countess-Regent Blanche rode with her army to Lorraine's capital of Nancy in 1218 and burned the town. Blanche then joined with Emperor Frederick II to besiege the castle of Amance. Duke Theobald I of Lorraine surrendered Amance by the end of May 1218, and officially renewed his fidelity to Blanche on June 1, at which point the rebellion largely collapsed and rebel barons started making their own separate peaces. Securing the Peace (1218-1222) Theobald I of Lorraine died in May 1220 under mysterious circumstances, and to seal the peace the 19-year-old Theobald IV of Champagne married Lorraine's 16-year-old widow, Gertrude of Dagsburg. Duke Theobald I's brother Matthew II, who succeeded in Lorraine, made peace and swore fealty to Blanche. Bishop William of Langres was elected archbishop of Reims in 1219, resulting in his fortuitous departure from the conflict. Erard renounced any claim on Champagne on 2 November 1221 and Philippa in April 1222. In return for renouncing his claims, Erard received a substantial cash settlement. The last rebel baron, Erard II of Chacernay, swore his renewed loyalty to Theobald IV in March 1222. Two months later in May 1222, Theobald IV reached the age of maturity and began his reign as count, and the triumphant Countess-Regent Blanche withdrew to the Cistercian convent of Argensolles for her retirement. Aftermath Blanche and Theobald IV had centralized comital authority within Champagne, reining in the rebellious local barons and ending any pretensions of collegiate rule in the county. Theobald IV promptly divorced Gertrude as soon as he came of age and peace was secured, terminating their brief two-year-long and childless marriage, in order to marry Agnes of Beaujeu. Unfortunately, Theobald IV's rule was initially marked by a series of misfortunes: he was accused of abandoning King Louis VIII at the siege of Avignon (1226), costing him the royal alliance he had relied on to secure his inheritance. Moreover, strong rumors began to spread that Theobald IV was having an affair with Louis VIII's widow, the Queen Regent Blanche of Castile (ruled 1226-1234), for whom he composed a poetic homage (Blanche of Castile and Theobald IV's father Theobald III were both grandchildren of Eleanor of Aquitaine). Theobald IV was becoming increasingly influential at court, and the other great counts of France were becoming resentful (it is entirely possible that the rumors of an affair with the queen regent were indeed unfounded, and merely fabricated by other barons jealous of his position at court). In general, the other barons were jealous of the strengthened County of Champagne which had emerged from the Succession War, and now presented a major rival to surrounding areas. Whatever the case, the resentful other barons invaded Champagne from 1229-1230. Ironically, the alliances in the invasion were reversed from the arrangement they had been in during the Succession War: Count Henry II of Bar attacked Champagne from the east, prompting Theobald IV to ally with Lorraine to attack the County of Bar. Simon of Joinville, who had fought for the rebel faction during the Succession War, now allied with Theobald IV against the external threat, and aided him in ravaging Bar, which was on the northern border of Joinville's own lands. Unfortunately, the conflict with the County of Bar prompted the more powerful Duchy of Burgundy to invade Champagne from the south, led by Duke Hugh IV (his father Odo III, Blanche of Navarre's staunch ally, had died in 1218). This provoked Queen-Regent Blanche of Castile to intervene, in order to stop the spread of the conflict. Queen Alice of CyprusTheobald IV was able to repulse the attackers, but at great cost. Champagne's economy was so depleted by these two major wars, as well as the crusading debts of Theobald IV's father and uncle, that Theobald IV had to sell off his overlordship of the counties west of Paris that his ancestors held before expanding east to Champagne: Blois, Sancerre, and Chateaudun. Another major blow to morale came near the start of the invasion of 1229, when Blanche of Navarre died (of natural causes) while in retirement at Argensolles convent. Moreover, Theobald IV's second wife Agnes of Beaujeu suddenly died in 1231, leaving Theobald IV with only their five-year-old daughter, Blanche. This left Champagne in need of a male heir, prompting Theobald IV to remarry in 1232 to Margaret of Bourbon. The situation reached its nadir in 1233, when Henry II's elder daughter Queen Alice of Cyprus threatened to reprise the succession war of Theobald IV's minority yet again. Alice had become queen of Cyprus by marrying her stepbrother Hugh I of Cyprus in 1210. However, the fortunes of Theobald IV and Champagne dramatically shifted soon afterward, when in 1234 he became King of Navarre on the death of his uncle (after successfully outmaneuvering James I of Aragon's attempt to succeed in Navarre). Suddenly, Theobald IV became too wealthy and powerful for neighboring counts to risk fighting. This also ended Alice of Cyprus's attempt to renew the succession war, and she was paid off with a substantial cash settlement. Alice was at this time engaged in the War of the Lombards against Blanche's old ally Emperor Frederick II, so it is possible that Alice did not want to fight two wars at once, and wanted to concentrate on the direct threat to Cyprus itself. This war was based on Emperor Frederick II's attempt to claim the throne of Jerusalem and Cyprus, based on his marriage to Isabella II of Jerusalem, the young half-niece of Alice and Philippa (Isabella II's mother Maria was the daughter of Isabella I of Jerusalem by her previous husband Conrad, while Alice and Philippa were the daughters of her subsequent husband Henry II of Champagne). Maria died giving birth to Isabella II in 1212, and Isabella II died in 1228 giving birth to Frederick II's son Conrad IV, sparking the war against Frederick II over control of his son's regency. Theobald IV spent most of his subsequent time and attention in Navarre, but the removal of external threats ensured an unprecedented era of peace and prosperity for Champagne that would last for the next five decades. Margaret of Bourbon and Theobald IV ultimately had four surviving children together, including Theobald IV's successor Theobald II of Navarre (Theobald V of Champagne), who would rule from his father's death in 1253 to 1270. Theobald IV and Margaret's two daughters Margaret and Beatrix were married to the dukes of Lorraine and Burgundy respectively, to cement peaceful relations through marriage-alliance. After Theobald II/V died childless while on the Eighth Crusade, his younger brother Henry I of Navarre (Henry III of Champagne) succeeded him for a brief but talented reign which ended when he also died in 1274, leaving only his one-year-old daughter (Theobald IV's granddaughter) Joan I of Navarre as his heir. Henry's wife Blanche of Artois would rule Champagne as regent for Joan until 1284, when Joan (at 11 years old, still under the regency of her mother) was married to King Philip IV the Fair of France (who was himself 16 years old). With this marriage alliance to the Kings of France, Champagne was absorbed into the royal holdings. Philip IV and Joan had three sons who each ruled as king of France in turn, because each was unable to produce a male heir. When their last son Charles IV of France died without a male heir in 1328 the Capetian Dynasty ended, resulting in Philip of House Valois (Philip IV's nephew) and King Edward III of England (son of Isabella, Philip IV and Joan's daughter, great-granddaughter of Theobald IV) entering into conflict over the succession, which began the Hundred Years' War.

Krummes, Cruel Seas: World War 2 Merchant Marine-Related Nautical Fiction from the 1930s to Present, Institute of Transportation Studies, University of California, Berkeley. Shot in Jamaica, the film follows a group of survivors from a torpedoed British refugee ship. Plot Michael Cannon (Richard Burton) returns to London after the Second World War and places advertisements in the personal columns of various newspapers in an effort to re-unite with \\"Sea Wife\\", a lost acquaintance. Eventually Cannon, who publishes his adverts under the name \\"Biscuit\\", receives a letter summoning him to the Ely Retreat and Mental Home. There he meets an ill man nicknamed \\"Bulldog\\" (Basil Sydney), who tries to persuade Biscuit to give up the search. A flashback reveals the backstory. In 1942, people crowd aboard a ship, the San Felix, to escape Singapore before it falls to the Japanese Army. Biscuit is brusquely shouldered aside by a determined older man, \\"Bulldog\\", who insists the ship's black purser, later to be nicknamed \\"Number Four\\" (Cy Grant), evict the people from the cabin he has reserved. However, when he sees that it is occupied by hungry children and nuns, he reluctantly changes his mind. The nun with her back to him is the beautiful young Sister Therese, later nicknamed \\"Sea Wife\\" (Joan Collins). Later, the San Felix is torpedoed by a submarine. Biscuit, Sea Wife, Bulldog, and Number Four survive by going into the water and occupying a small life- raft. Only Number Four knows that Sea Wife is a nun; she asks him to keep that a secret. It soon becomes evident that Bulldog is a racist who does not trust Number Four. Later, they encounter a Japanese submarine whose captain at first refuses to offer them aid, but gives them food and water when Number Four negotiates with him in Japanese, though what he has said is kept a secret between himself and Sea Wife. Eventually, the quartet land on a deserted island. Number Four finds a machete, with which he builds a sturdier raft, made of tropical timber. After completion of the project, Number Four insists on keeping the machete to himself, which heightens Bulldog's distrust. Meanwhile, Biscuit falls in love with Sea Wife; she is tempted, but rejects his romantic advances without telling him the reason. Finally, the four are ready to set sail. Bulldog tricks Number Four into going in search of his missing machete, then casts off without him. When Biscuit tries to stop him, Bulldog knocks him unconscious with an oar. Number Four tries to swim to the raft, but is killed by a shark. Days later, the 3 survivors are picked up by ship, and Biscuit is taken to a hospital for a long recovery. By the time he is discharged, Sea Wife has gone. Here, the flashback ends, and the narrative returns to \\"Bulldog's\\" hospital room in London, where he informs Biscuit that Sea Wife died on the rescue ship. Heartbroken, Biscuit leaves the grounds and walks past two nuns without noticing that Sea Wife is one of them. She watches him leave in silence. Production Richard Burton accepted this acting assignment only because, at the time, Roberto Rossellini had been slotted by the Fox studio as the film's director. However, before actual shooting began in Jamaica, Rossellini, whose script would have invited censorship problems, bowed out of the production and was replaced by Bob McNaught.Brunette, Peter. Roberto Rossellini. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1996. p. 195. See also Bragg, Melvyn. Rich: The Life of Richard Burton. London: Hodder & Stoughton, Ltd., 1988 Sensing early during shooting that the film would wind up a dud, Burton concentrated his energies on two objectives: Joan Collins, who rejected his advances,Collins, Joan.

Yet despite waking every morning at 5 am with a terrible hangover, he was still able to contribute a full day's work.Munn, Michael. Richard Burton: Prince of Players. New York: Skyhorse Publishing, 2008. During initial exhibition of Sea Wife, The Daily Telegraph distributed miniaturized copies of the personal ads placed by \\"Biscuit\\" as a means of promoting itself as well as the film. The deserted- island scenes for this movie were photographed at the same Ocho Rios, Jamaica, location that had previously been used in such pictures as Island of Desire (1953) and All the Brothers Were Valiant (1953). The city of Kingston stood in for Singapore during early scenes of the film; and before the episode involving the torpedoed ship was shot, Richard Burton participated in a cricket match with some of the actors and extras who were about to be used for that scene.Polack, Peter.

She first appeared in The Spirit in March 1944. Ellen is the daughter of Police Commissioner Eustace Dolan. Origin Ellen Dolan first appeared in the second Spirit tale, dated June 9, 1940. The Spirit literally bumped into her and her fianc√©, Homer Creep, whilst sharing a taxi which is being driven by Ebony White. In this story Ellen was still in college while the two went to visit her father, Commissioner Dolan. She asked her father if she could look through the mental ward to see some actual cases in preparation for an upcoming Psychology exam she had. As she and Homer were looking at the different patients, Dr. Cobra (who was recently apprehended thanks to The Spirit) got their attention. He claimed to be a great scientist and the police were always arresting him just as he was about to complete a major experiment. He asked them to have pity and help him escape. The naive Ellen agreed to help him, not realizing what a danger he actually was. Dr. Cobra had some men waiting for him outside and they quickly made way to one of his hideouts. When the Commissioner realized his daughter was missing, he put his men on the case to search for her. The Spirit was listening in and agreed to help search for her. Forcing a thug to tell them where Dr. Cobra's hideout was, the Spirit was able to defeat Dr. Cobra again and save Ellen and Homer. Ellen played a prominent role amongst The Spirit, a comic filled with female characters. The Commissioner invited the Spirit to a dinner in honor of Ellen's announcement of becoming engaged to Homer. The Spirit decided to give her a gift. He gave her a make-over (which simply involved removing her glasses and loosening her hair). Homer was amazed at her hidden beauty. The Spirit then claimed his reward for saving Ellen, a reward that consisted of a passionate kiss. That kiss was enough to make Ellen reconsider her engagement. As Ellen's character developed, she soon became fixated with winning the heart of the Spirit. She would cause situations that required the Spirit to save her in order to attract his attention. From becoming someone who is prone to fainting when confronted with murder or monsters, Ellen becomes more inquisitive - and it is more likely that she will be the one doing the punching rather than being knocked out herself. She became more forthright and it was not atypical for her to tie up the Spirit or have a downright blazing argument with him if it would help her. And despite the Spirit's hesitations to commit, their relationship developed into a strong one over the years. On many occasions while lapsing into unconsciousness he would mutter \\"Ellen... \\" much to her delight and the annoyance of her competition. In the IDW republishing of The Spirit Ellen is portrayed as a councilwoman of the city The Spirit 1 However, up until 1950 Ellen's role was as a supporting character; she rarely got the chance to have a story to herself, unlike her father and the Spirit's co-stars (Officer Klink, Ebony, Sammy, etc.), who occasionally became the strip's center. But, with the November 12, 1950 section, Ellen finds herself becoming a candidate for mayor of Central City. After appearing in successful interviews on television and radio for her candidacy, The Spirit is furious and demands that she withdraws - of course this prompts Ellen to put even more effort into becoming mayor, with such comments as, \\"Most men practice equality like a little boy practicing on the piano, one hour a day and then forget all about it!\\" The Spirit goes off to support her nearest rival, Mike Poltax, on the Prosperity Party ticket, but it looks unlikely that Poltax will win. To help matters, Poltax arranges for Ellen to be kidnapped, but the Spirit finds out and calls the police before he is himself shot. Recovering in a hospital with Ellen by his bedside, The Spirit learns that Ellen has won by a landslide and is now mayor. It made no difference to their relationship, and Ellen did quite well at the job. In the IDW republishing of The Spirit she is now a councilwoman for the cityThe Spirit 1 Skills and personality Although Ellen is typically pictured as the helpless female victim, she maintains many talents as would be found in the daughter of a career policeman. She is well trained in jujitsu and can knock out a full-grown man with her patented right hook. She is also a crack markswoman, although she rarely carries a gun. Her skill with tactics and research have aided both her father and the Spirit on many occasions. She likewise has a natural political acumen which eventually leads to her becoming mayor of Central City. While she shows a good streetwise sense, she has the tradition of carrying her emotions to extreme limits. Devoted to the Spirit, she will turn her head to another handsome face if her hero shows distance. Her frailties include an inclination to gossip and breaking into tears when she feels she's \\"lost\\" a confrontation, romantic or otherwise.

Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust Thomas Farnolls Pritchard or Farnolls Pritchard (c. 1723‚Äì23 December 1777) was an English architect and interior decorator who is best remembered for his design of the first cast-iron bridge in the world. Biography Pritchard was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, and baptised in St Julian's Church, Shrewsbury on 11 May 1723. His father was a joiner. Thomas also trained as a joiner, but then developed a professional practice as an architect and interior designer. He specialised in the design of chimney-pieces and other items of interior decoration, and in funerary monuments.Leach, Peter, ‚ÄòPritchard, Thomas Farnolls (bap. 1723, d.1798)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2005 , accessed 1 September 2008 Pritchard worked closely with other local architects and craftsmen. William Baker of Audlem, an architect and contractor, used his plans to construct St John's Church, Wolverhampton.Colvin H. A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects 1600-1840 Yale University Press, 3rd edition London, 2008, 93 and 783 Joseph Bromfield, who worked for Pritchard initially as a plasterer, but became a very competent draughtsman and architect, appears to have taken over a large portion of Pritchard's architectural practice after Pritchard's death.\\"Colvin\\" 162-3, illustrates the close relationship between Pritchard and Bromfield's work. Pritchard's houses and churches have been described as \\"no more than pleasant provincial work\\". Such work includes the rebuilding of St Julian's Church, Shrewsbury, and Hatton Grange, Shropshire. Examples of Pritchard's interior decoration include Croft Castle, Gaines in Whitbourne, Herefordshire, Shipton Hall, Shropshire, the ballroom at Powis Castle, and chimney-pieces at Broseley Hall, The Lawns, Broseley, and Benthall Hall. He also designed the rococo drawing room at Tatton Hall, Cheshire. In the design of funerary monuments he employed coloured marbles, characterised by Rupert Gunnis as \\"school of Henry Cheere\\".Gunnis, Dictionary of British Sculptors 1660‚Äì1851, rev. ed. [1968], s.v. \\"Pritchard, Thomas Farnolls\\". These were usually in rococo or Gothic style, and later in neoclassical style. They include monuments to Ann Wilkinson, 1756, at Wrexham, Denbighshire; the Rev. John Lloyd, 1758, and Mary Morhall, 1765, both at St. Mary's Shrewsbury; and Richard Corbet, at Moreton Corbet, Shropshire. Pritchard's monuments can be found in churches across Shropshire, including also churches at Acton Round, Ludford and Barrow. Pritchard carried out work in Ludlow, including rebuilding its jail and the Hosier's Almshouses, and making alterations to the Guildhall. The Iron Bridge designed by Pritchard and made by Abraham Darby's Coalbrookdale works In 1769 Pritchard left Shrewsbury and moved to Eyton on Severn where he took up farming as well as continuing with his architectural work. He made various designs for bridges, none of which came to fruition, until he made plans for a bridge in cast iron to cross the River Severn in Coalbrookdale, Shropshire, adapting the principles of timber bridge-building. A modified version of his design was cast at the ironworks in Coalbrookdale in 1777‚Äì79. Pritchard died, aged fifty-four, before the bridge was completed, but his design of The Iron Bridge led to the building of the first cast-iron arch bridge in the world. He was buried in St Julian's, Shrewsbury, where his monument also commemorates his wife, Elinor Russell, of Shrewsbury (married 1751, died 1768) and three children who died young.

Its earliest definite member of the family was a certain Hilduin, who died before 956 and was known as comte de Montdidier.Medieval Lands Project The oldest known member of the family of some Montdidier is a Hilduin who died before 956 and was Count Montdidier.Foundation for Medieval Genealogy [archive] A close relative, also named Hilduin, perhaps his son, married Hersende, Lady of Ramerupt and Arcis- sur-Aube. Assumptions were exposed to clarify and complete the origin of the family, but proved unfounded or not usable. Thus: The Manasses name, carried by a son and grandson of Hilduin and Hersende returns home from Rethel, but the relationship between the two families is not known more precisely. There is also the tenth century Manasses, father of Gilbert, count of Chalon. Count Lu√ßay in his book Le comt√© de Clermont en Beauvaisis, √©tude pour servir √† son histoire (1878),La fondation du prieur√© de Saint-Leu d‚ÄôEsserent [archive] stated that the second Manasses was probably a bastard son of a William Count of Ponthieu, but whose existence is not certain. In any case, this would have been the Count William's maternal grandfather Manasses. First generations Hilduin Montdidier and Hersende, Lady of Ramerupt and Arcis-sur-Aube had three sons: #Manasses (‚Ä† 991), who became bishop of Troyes #Hugh I, Count of Ponthieu (ca. 970 ‚Äì ca. 1000). He married ca. 994 Gis√®le Capet and left two sons: ##Enguerrand I, who became Count of Ponthieu ##Guy of Ponthieu #Hilduin II, who became lord of Ramerupt. Hilduin II made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 992 and left two sons: ##Hilduin III, Count of Montdidier and Lord of Ramerupt, the elder branch ##Calvus Manasses, founder of the younger branch, which became the House of Dammartin. Hilduin III (died after 1031), had four sons: #Hilduin IV (‚Ä† 1063), Lord of Ramerupt and Count of Roucy by his marriage with Alix de Roucy #Guillaume #Manasses, Viscount de Reims in 1053, married to B√©atrice de Hainaut, ex-wife of Count Ebles I of Roucy. (B√©atrice and Ebles were the parents of Alix de Roucy, wife of Manasses' brother Hildouin IV). He himself had three children:The Genealogi√¶ Scriptoris Fusniacensis mentions four but identifies three. ##Manasses who was Archbishop of Reims, ##Guy ##Adele, abbess of Our Lady of Laon. ##Hilduin V had several children and two of them were at the founders of branches. House de Roucy Hildouin IV of Montdidier (‚Ä† 1063), who married in 1031 Alix de Roucy (‚Ä† 1062), increased the status of his lineage within the local nobility. Indeed, his new wife was descended through her mother from the counts of Hainaut and Capetian kings. Consanguinity between the parents of Alix led to the annulment of their marriage. Alix's father, Ebles I Count de Roucy had entered the orders and became Archbishop of Reims. Alix's mother would later remarry to a brother Hildouin. Hildouin and Alix gave birth to two sons: #Ebles II, who inherited Roucy, #Andrew, who had Ramerupt and is the founder of the younger branch, and many daughters,See Article IV of Montdidier Hildouin to have the list. married into the local nobility; except Beatrice, wife of Count Geoffroy II du Perche and Felicie, daughter of Ebles II married King Sancho Ram√≠rez I of Aragon. Ebles Roucy II (‚Ä† 1103) was frustrated in his struggle for increasing his domain. Indeed, in 1063, he led an army into Spain and took part in the crusade of Barbastro. After taking the city, he still fought in Spain and helped the king of Aragon Sancho Ram√≠rez to conquer the throne of Navarre. On this occasion, his sister Felicia married King. Then again he faced the Moors. He had taken part in the affairs of Spain in the hope of receiving an important stronghold, but could not get it, all these having been filled. He then went to Italy lend a hand to Robert Guiscard, prince of Salerno, but history repeated itself: he won the prestigious family alliances, since married the daughter of Robert Guiscard, but had no important fiefdom. Probably tired of these distant adventures or maybe just mellowed by age, he did not participate in the first crusade launched by Pope Urban II in 1095, just as his son did not. He took advantage of the absence of his neighbors by seeking to expand his domain to Champagne. Unable to tolerate his looting, the Archbishop of Rheims called for help the king, who sent his son and heir Prince Louis to restore order. After a short siege, Prince Louis was able to defeat Ebles II in 1102. He was succeeded by his son Hugues Cholet (‚Ä† 1160) who founded several religious institutions and married Richilde Hohenstaufen, niece of Emperor Henry V and sister of the future Conrad III. Hugues Cholet's son GuiscardHe is named Guiscard or Wiscardus in most contemporary documents, but later historians call him Robert Guiscard without knowing why the first name Robert was added. went to lend strength but left the Crusaders in 1170. He died in 1180, and was followed by his eldest son Raoul in 1196, and then his younger son Jean, marking the extinction of the elder branch of the family.

The project's principal aim was to learn about the life in the Soviet Union, which in turn would contribute to the disciplines of Sovietology, political science, economics and sociology. The study had three principal goals:Millar, page 9 *Conducting a study of contemporary Soviet society based upon interviews with recent immigrants now living in the United States. *Promoting the involvement of young scholars so that the field of Soviet studies developed. *Making the data and research products developed available to all interested scholars. The Soviet Interview Project had its origins in a meeting at the Kennan Institute in August 1979, where senior academic scholars and U.S. government specialists discussed the feasibility of such a project. One of the main obstacles was the \\"Kissinger rule\\", named after U.S. secretary of state Henry Kissinger who had established a policy against the use of federal funds for studies of emigrants from the USSR.Millar, page 5 The Kissinger rule was revoked after a successful lobbying effort, and a design phase proposal was funded by the National Council for Soviet and East European Research in November 1979. SIP made arrangements with the Department of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Department of State during the summer of 1981 so that the National Council could fund the project. The coordinating agency within the U.S. federal government was the Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) of the U.S. Department of State. The research team was headed by James R. Millar, economics professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. The team completed the draft of a general survey for the project in September 1981, developing an interdisciplinary questionnaire. The researchers decided to focus on the last ‚Äúnormal‚Äù period of life in the USSR, as applying for emigration could lead to marked changes in the applicant's life, thus introducing a possible bias.Millar, pages 11-12 The sampling frame for the SIP general survey was defined as all Soviet emigrants who arrived in the United States between January 1, 1979 and April 30, 1982, and who were between ages 21 and 70. 33,618 persons met the criteria, and 3,551 were included in the final sample. There were 2,793 respondents.Anderson, page 357 The field work for the general survey was conducted by the National Opinion Research Center. Among the Soviet Interview Project's findings were that there was a positive relationship between education and unemployment in the USSR (as opposed to in the United States, where it was a negative relationship), that the Soviet wage system rewarded and penalized external political behavior, and that popular support for the Soviet regime was linked to the sense of material satisfaction and the perceived capability of the KGB.

Early life Yarberry was born in Arkansas, to a family whose name was not Yarberry. He confessed this just prior to his death, to friend Elwood Maden, and that his family was respectable, and to protect them from the shame of the life he led, he would never reveal his true name, and, he never did. He also confessed to Maden that he'd been born in 1849, and that he had left his family's home after being involved in the killing of a man during a land dispute, after which he fled and changed his name. All of this is recorded in the book Deadly Dozen, written by author Robert K. DeArment. That book gives details about Yarberry, classifying him as one of the twelve least known but more dangerous gunmen of the Old West. Later research seems to indicate that he was, in reality, John Armstrong, and that he'd fled Sharp County, Arkansas wanted for murder. In 1873 he killed a man in Helena, Arkansas, fleeing once again. Yarberry first appears in historical accounts while riding with outlaw Dave Rudabaugh and gunman \\"Mysterious Dave\\" Mather during the 1870s, beginning in 1873, operating mostly in southern Missouri and northern Arkansas. During this period, the three engaged in several robberies. When they were implicated in the murder of a prominent rancher in Arkansas, the three rode into Texas. The three separated, and Yarberry settled for a time in Texarkana, Arkansas, but in 1875 he killed a man there also, whom he suspected of being a bounty hunter. At that time, Yarberry's bounty for the Sharp County murder was $200. He then entered Texas, and joined the Texas Rangers, serving in \\"Company B\\" of the \\"Frontier Battalion, stationed in Jack County, Texas. By accounts uncovered by Robert DeArment, Yarberry served honorably with the Rangers during his brief service with them, and departed in 1876, surfacing in Decatur, Texas under the name \\"John Johnson\\". He opened a saloon there, partnering with Bob Jones. However, when a bounty hunter came to Decatur, asking questions about Yarberry relating to the Sharp County murder, he sold out to his partner quickly and left town. The bounty hunter's body was found days later near Decatur, having been shot to death. Yarberry appeared shortly thereafter in Dodge City, Kansas, and by early 1878 he was in Canon City, Colorado. There he partnered with Tony Preston, opening a saloon and variety theater. Nineteenth-century performer Eddie Foy played there while Yarberry was part owner. Foy later wrote in his memoirs that Yarberry \\"fashioned himself a good violinist\\". When Foy and his partner, Jim Thompson, completed their engagement, Yarberry owed them several weeks pay. When they were not able to collect it entirely, Thompson stole a barrel of whiskey. Foy later wrote that he was surprised that his partner was this brave, as Yarberry was known to be a dangerous man. On March 6, 1879, the bartender of another saloon shot Yarberry's partner Tony Preston, wounding him severely, though he would eventually recover. This man is unnamed and has been reported to be the bartender of Kirby's Saloon and confusingly also that of the Gem Saloon. Yarberry fired three shots as the man fled, missing, then joined a posse in pursuit. The man Surrendered himself to the town marshal the next day on March 7th explaining that he only ran because he was afraid of being lynched. Preston left Las Vegas shortly after, selling out to Yarberry. A few months later, circa July 1879, Yarberry shipped his bar supplies to Las Vegas, New Mexico and departed Ca√±on City soon thereafter. Arriving in Las Vegas, New Mexico, he began operating another bar with a woman who was called Steamboat which was located on Center St, later known as Bridge St. She had been following the expansion of the railroad from Missouri all the way to Las Vegas, setting up shop at each new railhead camp or town. Some say Yarberry and Steamboat's establishment was also a brothel but there is no strong evidence that this was the case. Selling his share in the brothel, Yarberry moved to San Marcial, New Mexico, where his former partner Tony Preston had now settled, still recovering from his being shot earlier in the year. Shortly after arriving, Yarberry became involved in an affair with Sadie Preston, Tony Preston's wife, although it is likely the affair had begun much earlier in Canon City. When Yarberry left San Marciel, Sadie Preston and her 4-year-old daughter went with him. Lawman career Yarberry and Sadie Preston moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he befriended Bernalillo County, New Mexico Sheriff Perfecto Armijo. With Armijo's support, Yarberry was appointed as Albuquerque's first Town Marshal in 1880. Yarberry quickly proved to be a very good lawman, and killed two men only a short time after accepting the position, during arrest situations. However, Harry A. Brown, a self-proclaimed gunman, drifted into town sometime around the beginning of 1881. In 1876, Brown had played a minor role in thwarting a robbery committed by Dave Rudabaugh and other riders, near Kinsley, Kansas. Although never known to have shot anyone, he bragged of how many men he'd killed, and quickly gained a reputation in Albuquerque as a heavy drinker, with a temper and a habit of pulling his gun with little provocation. Sadie Preston and Brown became acquainted, and by February, 1881, the two were involved romantically. On the night of March 27, 1881, Brown and Sadie Preston were having dinner at Gerard's Restaurant. Yarberry was not aware that the two were involved, and Sadie had left her young daughter at home in his care, while she was out with Brown. John Clark, a coach driver, took the couple to the restaurant, and would be the only eyewitness to what happened next. According to reports of the day, Brown and Sadie entered the restaurant, and shortly thereafter Yarberry appeared, walking up the street holding the hand of the young Preston daughter. Brown, evidently hearing that Yarberry was seen walking toward the restaurant, walked outside the doorway. Yarberry walked past him with the little girl in tow, took her inside, then a few minutes later he came back outside and began speaking with Brown. According to Clark the two became increasingly irate. The two men walked to a nearby vacant lot, and continued arguing, during which time Brown repeatedly told Yarberry he was not afraid of him. Sadie Preston then appeared from the doorway of the restaurant, and called for Brown. Immediately, Brown hit Yarberry in the face, while at the same time Brown drew his pistol. Brown fired once, creasing Yarberry in the hand, at which point Yarberry drew his own pistol and shot Brown twice, in quick succession, in the chest. Brown died immediately. Sheriff Armijo arrived shortly thereafter, and reluctantly took Yarberry into custody. Several witnesses testified in a preliminary hearing that Brown had repeatedly announced publicly that he intended to kill Yarberry, and due to this as well as Brown having fired first, Yarberry was cleared on the grounds of self defense. For unknown reasons, several prominent people in town expressed dissatisfaction with the results of the hearing, and called for a Grand Jury indictment, which did convene in May, 1881. Yarberry's attorney, S.M. Barnes, produced a parade of witnesses on Yarberry's behalf, and on May 19, 1881, Yarberry was acquitted. However, less than a month after the acquittal, Yarberry killed again. On June 18, 1881, Yarberry sat on the front porch of his friend Elwood Maden's home, conversing with gambler Monte Frank Boyd. As they talked, a shot was heard coming from the direction of the R.H. Greenleaf Restaurant, and both Yarberry and Boyd ran to that location. What happened next is confusing, as no one was quite certain. Yarberry asked a bystander who fired the shot, to which the bystander indicated by pointing at a man who was walking away. Yarberry called to him, telling him to halt, he wanted to speak with him. Within seconds, three shots were fired, and Charles D. Campbell lay dead. Sheriff Armijo arrested both Yarberry and Boyd for the shooting. Yarberry claimed that Campbell, who was not known to Yarberry but who had a reputation as someone who drank too often, had turned toward him with a gun, and thus he fired in self-defense. One of his bullet wounds was in the back, but Yarberry claimed that the bullet in the back had to have come from when Campbell's body spun after being hit in the front. Campbell was armed, but no one could testify that his gun was out when he was shot. Again Yarberry, as well as Boyd who fired at least two rounds, was cleared in a preliminary hearing. This led to a loud public outcry, despite evidence at the time indicating that Yarberry had acted in good faith, in self-defense. Boyd left town, heading to Arizona, where he is alleged to have been killed by Navajo Indians the following year. Yarberry was again jailed, with anticipation of another Grand Jury hearing. On May 11, 1882, a Grand Jury indicted Yarberry for the murder of Campbell. The New Mexico Governor Lionel Sheldon, having newly taken office, and doing so in a time when news stories of Billy the Kid and John Kinney were rampant, was intent on making an example out of Yarberry. The New Mexico Attorney General, William Breedon, handled the case for the prosecution, assisted by Arnet R. Owen. For the defense, Yarberry was represented by Jose Francisco Chavez, I.S. Trimble, and John H. Knaebel. Witness Thomas A. Parks, an attorney from Platt City, Nebraska, brought forth the most damaging testimony, when he stated he saw the entire event, and stated further that he saw no gun in Campbell's hands. Campbell's pistol that he had in his possession had been fired, and Yarberry claimed he'd fired it at least once at him. No one could counter this, aside from Parks, who claimed this was false. Yarberry also claimed he had fired only one time, hitting Campbell in the front. Yarberry stated adamantly that he shot Campbell because Campbell tried to shoot him, and he never varied from that. The trial lasted three days, after which Yarberry was convicted and sentenced to hang. Yarberry insisted he had been \\"railroaded\\", and that he had acted correctly and in self-defense. On September 9, 1882, Yarberry and three others escaped from the Santa Fe, New Mexico jail, and he quickly found that a $500 bounty had been placed on him. The other prisoners were captured quickly, and Santa Fe County Sheriff Romulo Martinez organized a posse to hunt down Yarberry. On September 12, 1882, a posse led by Santa Fe Police Chief Frank Chavez captured Yarberry twenty eight miles outside of town. Five months later his appeal was denied. Attorney John Knaebel filed appeals and sent letters all the way to Washington, D.C., insisting his client was innocent of murder, but to no avail. In his final interview, Yarberry was told by the reporter that he looked pale, to which he replied, \\"Maybe. But I ain't sick, and I ain't scared either.\\" On February 9, 1883, under a guard provided by order of the governor, made up of the \\"Governor's Rifles\\", a New Mexico militia, Yarberry was marched to the gallows. His close friend, Sheriff Perfecto Armijo, was tasked with pulling the lever to hang him. Sheriff Armijo had staunchly supported Yarberry throughout the process, and also insisted he was being hanged unjustly. Yarberry requested that Colfax County Sheriff Mason T. Bowman take Sheriff Armijo's place, to save his friend from the task, but Sheriff Bowman declined. Over 1,500 people were in attendance to watch the hanging. As Sheriff Armijo pulled the lever, Yarberry proclaimed, \\"Gentlemen, you are hanging an innocent man.\\" After his death, Yarberry's supporters in Albuquerque continued to state, often publicly, that he was unlawfully and wrongfully condemned. Sheriff Armijo never wavered from his support of Yarberry. Many claimed that Yarberry was only convicted due to the more powerful and well-to-do citizens of Albuquerque believing that he hurt the reputation of the town, simply due to the fact that he was involved in numerous shootings. Sheriff Armijo claimed that whether innocent or not, it mattered little to the prominent people of the town, who were more concerned with the town's image.

The agency will also follow up issues related to infrastructure and expertise for the product and its support, thereby overcoming time delays in crucial projects.DRDO's Rustom UAV To Roll Out Soon .

It is often compared with Predator drones by Indian scientists and media. Current status A scaled down model of the Rustom-1 MALE UAV The Indian government has allowed the development of the Rustom MALE UAV project in association with a production agency cum development partner (PADP). The ADE officials indicated that the requests for proposals (RFP) would shortly be issued to four vendors which are the Tata Power Strategic Engineering Division, Larsen & Toubro Limited, Godrej Aerospace Limited and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited-Bharat Electronics Limited (joint bid) who were chosen out of the 23 firms that responded. Currently, negotiations are underway between these companies and the three Indian armed forces since the private majors are looking for support and commitment from them before they start executing any development and production plans. This is because of the fact that the chosen PADP will also have a financial stake in the Rustom project. The Armed Forces would also be asked to take up a financial stake and the Indian government may have to guarantee that a specific number of Rustom UAVs will be bought. Rustom-1 The first flight of Rustom-I UAV took place on 16 November 2009 at the Taneja Aerospace Air Field near Hosur. The demonstration resulted in the prototype crashing to the ground. Stated by the DRDO, the taxiing and takeoff was exactly as planned. Due to misjudgment of altitude of the flight, the on-board engine was switched off through ground command which made the on- board thrust developed to go to zero. Despite the mishap, the state-owned Defence Research and Development Organisation stated: \\"The flight proved the functioning of a number of systems such as aerodynamics, redundant flight control, engine and datalink, which go a long way towards the development of a complex UAV.\\" Rustom-1 UAV prototype The second \\"maiden\\" flight took place on 15 Oct 2010.

Description Anemone oregana is a perennial herb growing from a thick rhizome, generally high, but exceptionally to . A single basal leaf made up of three large leaflets on a petiole may be present. The inflorescence consists of a single tier of three leaflike bracts and a single flower. The bracts are similar to the basal leaf when the latter is present. The terminal leaflet may have a petiole or may be sessile. Its margin is sharply toothed on the distal half or third and its tip is pointed. Lateral leaflets may have a single lobe. The flower has no petals but 5 to 7 petal-like sepals in any of several colors, usually blue or purple but sometimes reddish, pink, white, or bicolored.

Li√©taud's daughter Ad√®le de Marle married first Aubry, Viscount of Coucy, and second the scandalous Crusader Enguerrand I, Lord of Coucy, with whom she had issue. # Yvette (possibly either Judith or Dada) de Roucy who married either Manasses II or Manasses III of Rethel. Although he is traditionally considered to have been the son of his predecessor, Giselbert, Count of Roucy and Reims and an unnamed daughter of William III \\"Towhead\\", Duke of Aquitaine, no contemporary document mentions a wife or children for Giselbert. Instead, a novel theory by Jean-No√´l Mathieu resolves some inconsistencies by placing Giselbert as his matrilineal great uncle. The new study, based on onomastic data, suggests that Eble I was the son of Eble de Poitiers (son of William IV, Duke of Aquitaine and Emma of Blois) and unnamed daughter of Aubry II, Count of M√¢con and Ermentrude of Roucy, Giselbert of Roucy's sister. Mathieu further notes that the conventional theory does not take into account that: *The first name Li√©taud is traditionally associated with the Counts of M√¢con, but not with the Roucy family; * The first name Eudes is traditionally associated with the Robertians, the Herbetiens, or the House of Blois;There is indeed the marriage between William IV of Aquitaine and Emma de Blois, but this marriage happened one generation after the putative Roucy-Aquitaine marriage proposed by the conventional theory. * The lands of Rumigny and Coucy had previously belonged to the Counts of Blois, but later passed to the Roucy line. Marriage and Descendants He married Beatrice of Hainaut, the daughter of Reginar IV, Count of Mons and Hedwig of France (daughter of Hugh Capet). From this union he had: *1. Alix, who succeeded him, and was married to Hilduin IV of Montdidier, Count of Ramerupt and Roucy, by whom she was the mother of Ebles II of Roucy. Her daughter, Margaret de Roucy, married Hugh, Count of Clermont, and they were the parents of Adeliza, who married Gilbert Fitz Richard; * 2. Hedwig, who inherited the lands of Rumigny after the death of her uncle, Eudes, and that married Geoffrey IV, Lord of Florennes. Around 1020, Ebles separated from his wifeAdelaide of Aquitaine, wife of Hugh Capet and grandmother of Beatrice, was the daughter of William III of Aquitaine. It is assumed that this marriage was annulled due to the consanguinity between the spouses. B√©atrice remarried Manasses of Montdidier, to whom she was also closely related. and took holy orders, being therefore elected archbishop of Reims. He also became count of Reims in 1023 and afterwards bound the county to the archdiocese. Beatrice then went on to marry Manasses de Ramerupt.

Started in 1966 by Erling Viksund, the company presently builds motor yachts at a facility in Strusshamn, on the island of Ask√∏y just outside Bergen. History The company was formed in 1966 and operated from an old farmhouse in Bergen. The first Viksund boat was the 25 Sabbcruiser. Viksund was among the pioneers for fiberglass boatbuilding in Norway, and attracted significant early sales. By the late 1960s the farmhouse facility was outgrown and Viksund relocated to Strusshaum. By the 1970s Viksun was one of Norway's largest boat- building firms, producing fishing vessels and motor yachts for export and domestic use. In the late 1980s the company was restructured after a fall in the market. New models were developed, and by the late 1990s Viksund was again among Norway's largest biggest boat building firms. Since 2000 the company has focused exclusively on motor yachts ranging from 30‚Äì40 feet, including the Viksund 320, Viksund 340 St Cruz, and the Viksund 360 St Cruz. The Viksund 27 columbi was one of many classic models developed by Viksund throughout the 1970s Viksund employs seventy people and produces approximately 80 yachts a year. It is run by Erling Viksund's son, Rune Viksund. Turnover in 2007 was $US 18.5 million. The export rate of the company is around 35% and the main export countries are Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and Russia.

Svoboda News, 24.08.08 The 2008 demonstration was organized to express the sentiment that the Russian Federation had reverted to such Soviet customs, an impression fueled by the inconsistency of official notices published in the media during the Russo- Georgian War.Youth Human Rights, 24 –∞–≤–≥—É—Å—Ç–∞ 2008 –≥–æ–¥–∞ Events and aftermath At noon on 24 August 2008, the protesters unfurled a banner reading For Our Freedom And Yours, and began to shout that slogan.–Æ–ª–∏—è –ë–∞—à–∏–Ω–æ–≤–∞: –°–º–µ–µ—à—å –≤—ã–π—Ç–∏ –Ω–∞ –ø–ª–æ—â–∞–¥—å? After several minutes, they started explaining their views to spectators, distributing notices, and answering questions. The basic views of the protesters included the following: * Political imprisonment has restarted in Russia * Elections have not been prudent * Love for country has been substituted with love for its leaders * The freedom that was created in 1968 is being suppressed today; it is still dangerous to express one's own opinion, and even bloggers are prosecuted. One police officer subsequently approached the protesters and requested that they leave the area. The protesters complied and began walking along the Red square along with the officer; other officers subsequently joined the group. The protesters handed the banner to the police officers and left the Red Square; only three of them, Dmitroshkin, Zboroshenko and Ninenko, were detained, along with several spectators who took pictures and recorded videos of the event. These pictures and videos were destroyed, and one camera was reported to have been broken by the police. Four journalists were amongst the detained spectators, namely *Elena Kostyuchenko (–ï–ª–µ–Ω–∞ –ö–æ—Å—Ç—é—á–µ–Ω–∫–æ), from newspaper Novaya Gazeta (¬´–ù–æ–≤–∞—è –≥–∞–∑–µ—Ç–∞¬ª); *Ivan Rusayev (–ò–≤–∞–Ω –†—É—Å–∞–µ–≤), from newspaper Vedomosti (¬´–í–µ–¥–æ–º–æ—Å—Ç–∏¬ª); *Dmitriy Borko (–î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–π –ë–æ—Ä–∫–æ), from Grani-TV (¬´–ì—Ä–∞–Ω–∏-–¢–í¬ª); and *Dmitriy Shibayev (–î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–π –®–∏–±–∞–µ–≤), from newspaper New Times (¬´–ù—ä—é –¢–∞–π–º—Å¬ª).

The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. It is found in Europe, through Siberia to eastern Asia. John Curtis's British Entomology Volume 6 The wingspan is 27‚Äì35 mm. The ground colour is light brown or white brown to reddish brown. The forewings, which exhibit a fine regular pattern of dark, finely serrated lines have a dark patch in the middle. Under the sickle, or on the outer part of the outer edge of the wing, there is a purple stain. From the wing tip, a clearly curved, dark brown band runs under the stain up to the edge of the wing. The hindwings are also light brown, but brighter than the forewings. Their pattern is similar to but not so strong as that of the forewings. In the females the hindwings are white with the same dark patterning. The egg is yellow marked with orange at one end. The last instar caterpillar is green, the dorsum reddish brown, except towards the black-marked yellowish head. There are two conspicuous warts on rings two and five, and less obvious raised spots on the other rings, all bearing hairs. In the younger stages it is blackish, with white marks on the fourth and seventh rings; later it becomes greenish below, and the markings on the back of rings four, seven, eight, and ten are whitish or creamy. The moth flies from April to August depending on the location. The larvae feed on birch and sometimes alder.

Biography   Getting interested in music, first bands  Popoviƒá was born in Belgrade and lived at Alekse Nenadovica street connecting \\"Slavija\\" and \\"Metropol\\" hotel, inhabited by people from highest social positions, such as lawyers, politicians, musicians, sportsman, etc., to the lowest, such as prostitutes, drug dealers, thieves, etc. In his early youth he brought some LP compilations of Opatija festivals and played them while using a wooden cigarette box as a drum and after hearing The Who's album A Quick One, he decided to become a drummer. His real drum practices started after moving to Bombay with his father (then being in Yugoslavian Foreign Services), Dejan and mother Bo≈æica (sister Dubravka - stood in Belgrade) where he, for the first time, had the chance to practice on a real drum set. His first live appearance was at a Bombay college anniversary. On return to Belgrade Popoviƒá first joined the band Dag, with whom he recorded a single \\"Voz\\" / \\"Smiljana\\" in 1973. After Dag, he formed a hard rock trio Jocker, and then Jesen before joining the band of Slaƒëana Milo≈°eviƒá.  Zvuk Ulice and Propaganda  In 1976, guitarist and singer, Vlada Divljan, and bass guitarist, Zdenko Kolar, formed a band called Merlin. The band also included Popoviƒá on drums, keyboard player Dragan Mitriƒá, Bora Atiƒá on saxophone and Dragana Milkoviƒá on piano and vocals. Beside their own songs the band often performed songs by Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. Their musical style was a combination of melodic rock, jazz rock and hard rock. The band often performed at Belgrade's SKC (Studentski Kulturni Centar a.k.a. SKC or Students Cultural Centre), appeared on the last BOOM festival in Novi Sad and Zajeƒçar Guitar festival. They did not have any releases, but had some recordings, recorded in Radio Belgrade studio, which were broadcast from time to time. In early 1979 Popoviƒá's future wife got pregnant and he also had to serve the Yugoslav People's Army which caused the breaking up of the band. He made a two-year break and joined Idoli. In 1982 Popoviƒá (guitar, vocals) with Mitriƒá (keyboards), Branko Isakoviƒá (bass, rhythm guitar) and Nenad Morgenstern (percussion) formed the off project Propaganda. The band recorded only one album, Apatija javnosti which partially featured material from Zvuk Ulice period. The sound was a Pop rock combined with other musical forms. After the album release, the band split up.  Idoli  Popoviƒá joined Idoli as a replacement for Bo≈æa Jovanoviƒá. The band started recording their first long play album in Radio Belgrade studios during the late 1981 and early 1982. Odbrana i poslednji dani surprised the critics as much as the fans. It was named after Borislav Pekiƒá's eponymous book, on which the whole album is based. It is a complex concept album dealing with an anthropological approach towards Orthodox Christianity. Since the album was sold in only 50,000 copies, which was considered a failure by Jugoton the band had to completely turn towards commercial music. The next release was the album ƒåokolada featuring bassist Branko Isakoviƒá instead of Zdenko Kolar who went to serve the Yugoslav People's Army. It was recorded in London with producer Bob Painter who completely changed the band's style. The record was sold in 350,000 copies which was a record at that time in Yugoslavia. Even though the band had a successful tour, the relationships between the band members became colder. After the Ljubljana show due to a quarrel, Idoli ceased to exist. The last release as Idoli was a soundtrack album for ≈†est dana juna which was written by Divljan while the rest of the band recorded their parts.  Post-Idoli career  After Idoli disbanded Popoviƒá joined the band Muƒçenici and also played with a super-session band Kod Tri Balona (featuring Disciplina Kiƒçme bassist Du≈°an Kojiƒá Koja and Elektriƒçni Orgazam guitarist Branislav Petroviƒá Banana). In the early nineties he moved to Johannesburg, South Africa and formed his own band The Traitors. The lineup featured Belgrade musicians living in Johannesburg: Popoviƒá on rhythm guitar and vocals and Marka Benini on drums, with musicians from South Africa Derrick Skihippers (lead guitar) and Kahlan Merchant (bass guitar). The band performs a heavier version of rock and roll standards. In 2006 Kokan & The Traitors performed in Belgrade and Zdenko Kolar appeared as guest musician.

In 2018, the company had operations in 24 countries including USA, UK, Australia, Kenya, UAE, Spain, Portugal, New Zealand and Sri Lanka. The leather goods segment of Hidesign contributes to 160 crore of revenue.  Products  The company is the manufacturer and marketer of leather products including handbags, briefcases, laptop bags, travel bags, wallets, accessories, belts, jackets, shoes, footwear and sunglasses. It has 5 manufacturing facilities: * Sikkim * Baddi (Himachal Pradesh) * Puducherry (Two facilities) * Chennai (Tannery)  History  Dilip Kapur (President) started Hidesign as a hobby. He had joined Princeton to do his PhD in International affairs and worked part time in a leather factory. In this factory, Kapur learned how to work with leather. He came back after completing his education and started buying leather from Chennai to design bags in Auroville. When a friend paid him INR 300 for a bag, he was surprised and decided to put more effort into it and started Hidesign with a capital of INR 25,000 and one cobbler. Through his friends and family, Hidesign reached Germany, Australia, England, and USA and scaled up. A german company called Welthungerhilfe placed an order for more than 1000 bags and helped with funds to support the delivery of the order.The company started producing for India only by the year 2000. Hidesign only had customers who were not going to mainstream stores. Hidesign reached mainstream stores only after 10 years. During his work with leather with Denver, US,, he got to know that the best supplier for high-quality vegetable-tanned leather that could be used for hand coloring was E.I. Leather. When he probed further, he found that E.I. stood for ‚ÄòEast India‚Äô and the leather was being procured 100 miles far from his own home town - Pondicherry. The technique used by E.I. leather was exhaustive and it involved keeping the hides soaked for 40 days in a combination of wattle bark and myrobalan seeds; then the hides were rubbed with pungam oil, a local oil that made leather more supple. When he returned and tried to find the E.I. leather, he got to know that most tanneries didn‚Äôt use the same technique anymore and have moved to chemically tanned leather for economical reasons which also contributed to the pollution. He decided to find the last remaining tanners who were still following the E.I. leather technique and to innovate further for ecological tanning. For buckles, he decided to choose brass over Zinc alloy and steel buckles despite that brass took more time and skill. He took inspiration from Hindu temples in India where brass was the preferred metal for Indian gods. The first bags that Hidesign was able to send to Europe and USA were ecological and natural and reflected craftsmanship and hence were able to establish themselves fast.  Hidesign in India  The first store in India was opened in 1990 in Pondicherry. Post that, some stores were opened in Mumbai and Delhi.

According to the 2002 census, the town has a total population of 9,066 but tadte there almost 30,000 people ( approximately). Manda is a small town along Lake Nyasa (Nyasa means Lake), in Ludewa District. According to the United Nations estimates (2018), Manda has a total population of almost 30,000. The small town of Manda was known as Weidhafen during the time of German East Africa. Germans promoted commerce and economic growth. Lake Nyasa in Tanzania also known as Lake Malawi in Malawi, and Lago Niassa in Mozambique is one of the truly wonderful places in the world. The lake itself is the 7th largest in the World, the third largest in Africa and has been in existence for millions of years (estimates range from about 2-20my). In just one lake it contains over a thousand species of fishes, more than the North American and European continents combined. Lake Nyasa is between 560 kilometres (350 mi) and 580 kilometres (360 mi) long, and about 75 kilometres (47 mi) wide at its widest point. The lake is 706 m (2,316 ft) at its deepest point, located in a major depression in the north-central part. The largest river flowing into it is the Ruhuhu River in Manda, and there is an outlet at its southern end, the Shire River, a tributary that flows into the very large Zambezi River in Mozambique. The majority of the species are in the family Cichlidae, popular with aquarists, but there are also lungfishes, elephant- noses, mastacemblid eels and catfishes. They are often very colourful and have interesting behaviours - making for fascinating fish-watching. The great diversity in the lake means that most species have unique adaptations and occupy specialised ecological roles in the lake. Some scrape algae from the rocks, some filter sand, some eat snails, some live in empty snail shells, some eat plants, some eat fish, some eat scales, some mimic dead fish to allow them to catch unwary prey. Most are maternal mouth breeders, which mean that the females carry the eggs and young (!) around in their mouths. All of this in a lake that offers warm, clear water, with white sands and clean hot rocks to sunbathe on. Lake Nyasa is probably the most beautiful one. It is surrounded by vast plains and the impressive Livingstone Mountains. Manda has experience a ton of historical legacies, ranging from being the host of naval battle between the British and the German.
