The story revolves around Rogelio Manglicmot, an electrician in the small barrio of Pelaez. Plot Kapitan Sino is a fictional story by Bob Ong about Rogelio Manglicmot, an average Electronics Technician in a town called Pelaez who became a Super Hero after learning his Special abilities. With the help of his best friend Bok-bok and his childhood friend Tessa (whom he also bears romantic feelings), he treads the path of saving lives and offering help to those in need. After some confusion of what to call the mysterious crime fighter, the people decided to call him \\"Kapitan Sino\\" (translated as Captain Who?). Kapitan Sino then start his adventures as he goes one on one with a giant gorilla, saves people trapped inside a burning building, prevents structures from collapsing during an earthquake, stops a Train from going off rail and caught small fry criminals faster than the local authorities. As the story progresses, a series of abduction occurs in Pelaez by a mysterious Hairy Monster. It was later revealed that the same Monster is Mayor Solomon Suico who abducts victims for their blood to sustain his Son Michael who inherited his form however with more severity. Kapitan Sino engages in a fierce battle with Mayor Suico after he followed him to an abandoned hospital where he keeps his victims. Kapitan Sino defeats Mayor Suico and kills him; Suico's Son Michael soon follows after being injured in the rubbles made by the battle. Kapitan Sino searches the abandoned hospital for Suico's latest victim. He finds Tessa instead, unconscious and bleeding. He rushes her to the nearest hospital, Tessa however dies. After the death of Tessa, Rogelio loses enthusiasm towards life and goes full time super hero. His father Mang Ernesto confronts him telling him that it was not his fault he could not save Tessa and to stop being a super hero if he is not happy. He also confesses himself as Mayor Suico's half brother. Mang Ernesto tried to make Rogelio Realize that being a Hero does not need recognition but acts as one to make things right. Following the death of Mayor Suico, the Vice Mayor Samonte took the vacant position as Mayor of Pelaez. Mayor Samonte then organizes a program to thank Kapitan Sino giving a token of appreciation, a check worth 30 thousand Philippine Peso (in which most of the sources he already took for himself from Public fund). At the sound of such huge amount, one by one, false Kapitan Sinos began to appear wearing phony Kapitan Sino costumes from old motorcycle helmets. The people went amok and one of them threatened to throw grenade. The grenade fell as everyone fled for their lives, Rogelio (wearing Kapitan Sino costume) rushed and covered the explosion, tearing his costume and burning his helmet, revealing himself as the true Kapitan Sino. The Police arrives to control the situation, Aling Chummy seemingly lost her sanity approaches Rogelio( who barely can't stand and is assisted by Bok-bok) and slaps him. He blames Rogelio for the death of his husband who died of Lung Cancer, and asserts that Rogelio is at fault for not warning him. The Police arrests Rogelio and Bok-bok, but leaves the man who threw the grenade free. Meanwhile, a Mysterious Disease threatens the whole world. The epidemic finally reaches Philippines making the citizen anxious for their lives. To find a cure, Doctors from all over the world decided to get samples of blood from everywhere to match the cure they are developing. Rogelio and Bok-bok (imprisoned) were also forced to give samples of their blood. Rogelio's blood matches the cure and is taken by the Medical Expert for his blood, leaving Bok-bok behind already infected with the disease. After taking much of his blood, Rogelio (now all weak and dizzy) tried to find his parents. An unknown man carrying a child slips from the panicking crowd and rushes to Rogelio asking him if his blood cures, Rogelio nods as the man stabs him to get his blood. Rogelio dies as well as his parents who were infected by the disease. Following the death of Rogelio, Bok-bok attends another program held in his honor. During Mayor Samonte's speech of his false service instead of honoring Kapitan Sino, Bok-bok approaches him and strikes him on the face. The story ends with Bok-bok, saved from the mysterious disease, relives Kapitan Sino's legacy in himself.  Characters  * Rogelio Manglicmot/Kapitan Sino: Rogelio Manglicmot is the main protagonist of the story. Rogelio is a capable Electronics technician who lives in a small town called Pelaez. Though he was described in the story as an average Filipino male, Rogelio possesses incredible strength and seems to have an effect to electricity . With the support of Bok-bok his best friend and Teng a.k.a. Tessa his childhood friend, he decided to use his ability to help people. Tessa being excited about the birth of the Super Hero made his costume using old clothes from her aunt who lives abroad. Rogelio's costume as super hero is a silver and gray body suit with gloves partnered by an old black Converse Chuck Taylor sneakers. His face is hidden by his weird and funny helmet with red eyes that looks like two big tomatoes with small nose and mouth clearly not proportional to the eyes (apparently would somewhat look like \\"Masked Rider\\" from Japan) and also equipped by high frequency hearing device and clear vision lens that only works on Rogelio because of his electric ability. After some of his heroic deeds as a masked crusader, the people decided to name him as \\"Kapitan Sino\\" (translated as \\"Captain Who?\\" in English), after the some confusion by the bystanders. It was later revealed that Mayor Suico was actually his uncle and, like his uncle, his father also has special abilities. Aside from his super natural abilities, Rogelio's blood also had the ability to cure the \\"Mysterious disease\\" that threatened the whole world. Rogelio dies after an unknown man breaks in from the crowd and stabs him in hope of curing his child with the blood from Rogelio. * Bok-bok: Bok-bok is the best friend of Rogelio Manglicmot. He is described as a Fat guy with an incredible sense of humor, which always annoys Rogelio. Though Rogelio treats him as a pest, Bok-bok has always been welcomed as family by the Manglicmot. Bok-bok is an orphan who lives with his aunt, which is why he is always at Rogelio's place. Surprisingly enough that it was Bok-bok's persuasion that led to Rogelio's decision in becoming a Super Hero as Bok-bok reasons that Rogelio has the ability that exceeds others and that it should be used as part of his responsibility for having such gift. It was also during his discussion with Rogelio when the super hero made his first appearance as a Topless Ninja (Ninjang Hubad) when he caught and put at the top of the Church a thief who stole a watermelon. It was also told in the story that he had been childhood friends with Rogelio and Teresa (also known as Teng or Tessa).

During his conversation with Rogelio at the roof of Sto. Domingo Church, She believes that love is not about how the person looks but of what is inside. She also tells Rogelio that her being blind is a blessing for her, because she sees the real person instead of the outer appearance. It is clearly implied that Rogelio bears a deep romantic affection towards the young lady. Teresa's feelings for Rogelio, remains unclear however. It was later revealed that it was Tessa, not some child, was abducted by Mayor Suico for blood transfusion which will be used to sustain Michael's Life. She dies by blood loss after Kapitan Sino rescues her from the abandoned Hospital. It was also stated in the story that part of the reason for Tessa's death was lack of Cotton balls, there was no doctor and other petty things which if by any chance people made efforts could have saved her life. * Mang Ernesto: Mang Ernesto is Rogelio's father. It was stated that once, he was a strong man until his sickness which led to him being unable to work. He is always in a bad mood most probably because of his frustration. It was revealed that he had the same ability as Rogelio in which he however did not use, this is the reason why he believes that his disability was the price he had to pay for running away from the responsibility. He also confesses that Mayor Suico (the hairy monster) is his half brother. He dies along with his wife \\"Aling Hasmin\\" after being infected by the Mysterious disease. * Aling Hasmin: Aling Hasmin is Rogelio's mother.

He is described in the story as a kind hearted man. He offered a ride in his car for the pregnant Aling Baby, gave a brand new sewing machine to his driver's wife and helped a certain family in supporting the hospitalization of a child with Hydrocephalous. He doesn't want to be treated as someone different as he wants himself to be called by his nickname \\"Omeng\\" instead of Mayor Suico. It was revealed in the story that he is the Hairy Monster that abducts the people of Pelaez and his kindness serves as an atonement. His abduction is a way to support the life of his son \\"Michael\\" who is also a \\"different kind\\". He transfuses the blood of the victims in order to keep Michael alive. Unfortunately after abducting Tessa, he engages with a fierce battle with Kapitan Sino inside an abandoned hospital and is defeated. He is revealed to be Kapitan Sino's uncle, a half brother of Mang Ernesto * Michael: Michael is Mayor Solomon Suico's only son. He is described as a deformed human with a figure resembling a hairy whale. He is sustained by the blood of his father's victims. He dies along with his father after being injured by rubbles during his father's encounter with Kapitan Sino. Minor Characters * Aling Chummy: Aling Chummy was known for being a kindhearted person in the town of Palaez. She later lost her sanity after Rogelio is revealed to be Kapitan Sino.

GAZE is an acronym for the Basque term 'gazte ekinzale' which refers to an entrepreneurial youth. GAZE: Gipuzkoa Gazte Ekinzale is a territorial strategy created in 2008 and funded by the Department of Innovation and Social Knowledge of Gipuzkoa‚Äôs Provincial Council . The objective of GAZE is to encourage entrepreneurial culture and the sense of initiative among young students of higher education of the province of Gipuzkoa (Basque Country). The goal of the initial phase of GAZE is that students take full responsibility of the design of the next territorial program to promote the entrepreneurial culture and the sense of initiative within higher education. Governance In accordance with the governance type of management, GAZE ensures that students, as final users of the future program that promote the entrepreneurial culture, take part in an active way at every stage and in every decision of the project. To achieve that, between October 2008 and December 2008 GAZE organized various events (above all, GAZEabian and GAZE in your classroom) in which more than 600 students of Gipuzkoa shared their ideas about how to increase entrepreneurial awareness. The document for the territorial program, which has to be delivered in November 2009 to the Local Delegation of Gipuzkoa will transfer the proposals gathered among students in those events. GAZE ABIAN and GAZE in your classroom Between October and December 2008, more than 500 students participated in the events called GAZE ABIAN (which in basque means, 'setting off GAZE'). Every university of Gipuzkoa organized its own particular event, coherent with its own vision, and all provided an opportunity to directly survey the proposals that students had to encourage entrepreneurialship among themselves. Declaraci√≥n Institucional GAZE. Based on the results of the events GAZE ABIAN, between April and May 2009, 123 students of all universities of Gipuzkoa participated in the workshops 'GAZE in your classroom'. Those students had the opportunity to sharpen the proposals gathered in the GAZE ABIAN as well as to think about new proposals. Some results The 343 valid proposals gathered in the GAZE ABIAN event, where classified in 4 areas of application: - Changes in the curriculum or in the academic methodology, 147 proposals, 43%; - Creation of social nets, 93 proposals, 27%; - Improvement of infraestructures, 70 proposals, 20%; Creation of institutional nets, 33 proposals, 10%. In the 'GAZE in your classroom' workshops there were 326 valid proposals, most of them in line with the proposals gathered in the GAZE ABIAN events: - Changes in the curriculum or in the academic methodology, 136 proposals, 41.7%; - Creation of social nets, 57 proposals, 17.4%; - Improvement of infraestructures, 84 proposals, 25.7%; Creation of institutional nets, 49 proposals, 15.2%. Inter-institutional To lead a strategy of territorial dimension, GAZE has reached an agreement with all the institutions of higher education in Gipuzkoa: University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), the University of Deusto, University of Mondragon, the University of Navarre and Tknika, which encloses most superior grade formative centres. This institutional commitment is covered in a declaration signed on 11 June 2009 by the deputy Jos√© Ram√≥n Guridi as well as the representatives of all the universities and Tknika . The sense of initiative GAZE promotes the sense of initiative and the entrepreneurial culture among students of higher education in Guip√∫zcoa. The sense of initiative or the fact of undertaking must not only be understood, however, in relation to the creation of firms. In accordance to the European Commission (EC 2006/962), the sense of initiative is the skill of a person to transform ideas into action. It is related to creativity, innovation, the assumption of risks and the capacity to recognize actual opportunities. It means the skill to plan and to manage projects to reach objectives, working both individually or collectively. It is characterized by the initiative, the pro-activity, the independence and the innovation. (\\"Recommendation of the European Parliament and the Council on the 18 December 2006 on key competences for permanent learning \\"). GAZE takes that definition of sense of initiative' and, along the same lines, it adopts a wide and inclusive entrepreneurship concept. Within the framework of the GAZE project, 'to entrepreneur' means to set projects in motion in any life context. IKERSAREA The project GAZE is also building a social net, called GAZE IKERSAREA, to connect researchers, experts and managers of programs related with the encouragement of the entrepreneurial culture among higher degree students. GAZE IKERSAREA has an interdisciplinary and inter- institutional character as well. The type of research of GAZE IKERSAREA is action-oriented. In that sense, all results are openly available to students, professors, institutional responsibles, public policy makers and stakeholders. The main goal of this initial phase of GAZE IKERSAREA is to integrate in the design of the program that students are leading the views and ideas of all other agents that are committed with the cultural transformation that GAZE seeks: professors, stakeholders, institutional responsibles and graduates.

It contains a portion of the Chester Rows, is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is included in the English Heritage Archive. Its frontage was built in 1700 in Georgian style but much medieval material remains behind it. History In 1700 George Booth rebuilt two medieval houses as his town house. He built a frontage in Georgian style, but behind this much of the medieval fabric was retained. The frontage was angled into the street so that the house could be seen better from Chester Cross; however as a result of this he was fined ¬£10 for encroaching into the street. In the 1740s and 1750s the building was used as the assembly rooms for the town's social functions. Subsequently, it has been used as an auction gallery and, as of 2010, houses a firm of solicitors. Reopened in October 2016 as a gallery, tearoom, deli, chocolatier, gifts and accessories. The top two floors of the building will be renovated and used as micro office space for artists studios and offices for startups, micro businesses operating in the creative industries. Architecture At a time when buildings elsewhere in the town had enclosed their portion of the Rows, the architect designing the frontage of Booth Mansion retained its section of the Row. The frontage is built in brick with stone quoins; it has eight bays and two storeys. Behind the frontage is medieval stonework and timber; the roof is of grey slates. At the street (undercroft) level are shop fronts and doorways between nine stone piers. At the Row level, overlooking the street, are three piers and six Tuscan columns. In the storey above the row are eight tall windows, each with four leaded lights, above which is a string course. The top storey has eight six-light sash windows. Above these is a cornice and, from the roof, four gabled dormers with two-pane casement windows protrude. =Interior= In the undercroft is a medieval stone arcade and a wooden joist which has been dated by dendrochronology to 1260‚Äì80. At the level of the Row, a 13th-century oak doorway remains from the medieval hall. In the storey above the Row is the 18th-century assembly room which measures 16m by 10m and stretches across the full width of the building. The room is panelled and has a fireplace against the east wall. Elsewhere the medieval details of rooms has been obscured by modern additions.

To meet the goal systems of this kind attempts to compute a path through a multi-dimensional space contained in the real world\\". The 4D/RCS is a hierarchical deliberative architecture, that \\"plans up to the subsystem level to compute plans for an autonomous vehicle driving over rough terrain. In this system, the world model contains a pre- computed dictionary of possible vehicle trajectories known as an ego-graph as well as information from the real-time sensor processing. The trajectories are computed based on a discrete set of possible vehicle velocities and starting steering angles. All of the trajectories are guaranteed to be dynamically correct for the given velocity and steering angle. The systems runs under a fixed planning cycle, with the sensed information being updated into the world model at the beginning of the cycle. These update information include information on what area is currently under observation by the sensors, where detected obstacles exist, and vehicle status\\". History The National Institute of Standards and Technology‚Äôs (NIST) Intelligent Systems Division (ISD) has been developing the RCS reference model architecture for over 30 years. 4D/RCS is the most recent version of RCS developed for the Army Research Lab Experimental Unmanned Ground Vehicle program. The 4D in 4D/RCS signifies adding time as another dimension to each level of the three- dimensional (sensor processing, world modeling, behavior generation), hierarchical control structure. ISD has studied the use of 4D/RCS in defense mobility, transportation, robot cranes, manufacturing, and several other applications. 4D/RCS integrates the NIST Real-time Control System (RCS) architecture with the German (Bundeswehr University of Munich) VaMoRs 4-D approach to dynamic machine vision. It incorporates many concepts developed under the U.S. Department of Defense Demo I, Demo II, and Demo III programs, which demonstrated increasing levels of robotic vehicle autonomy. The theory embodied in 4D/RCS borrows heavily from cognitive psychology, semiotics, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.Albus et al. (2002). 4D-RCS A Reference Model Architecture For Unmanned Vehicle Systems Version 2.0. National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899Aug 2002. Three US Government funded military efforts known as Demo I (US Army), Demo II (DARPA), and Demo III (US Army), are currently underway. Demo III (2001) demonstrated the ability of unmanned ground vehicles to navigate miles of difficult off-road terrain, avoiding obstacles such as rocks and trees. James Albus at NIST provided the Real-time Control System which is a hierarchical control system. Not only were individual vehicles controlled (e.g. throttle, steering, and brake), but groups of vehicles had their movements automatically coordinated in response to high level goals. In 2002, the DARPA Grand Challenge competitions were announced. The 2004 and 2005 DARPA competitions allowed international teams to compete in fully autonomous vehicle races over rough unpaved terrain and in a non-populated suburban setting. The 2007 DARPA challenge, the DARPA urban challenge, involved autonomous cars driving in an urban setting. 4D/RCS Building blocks The 4D/RCS architecture is characterized by a generic control node at all the hierarchical control levels. The 4D/RCS hierarchical levels are scalable to facilitate systems of any degree of complexity. Each node within the hierarchy functions as a goal-driven, model-based, closed-loop controller. Each node is capable of accepting and decomposing task commands with goals into actions that accomplish task goals despite unexpected conditions and dynamic perturbations in the world. =4D/RCS Hierarchy= A high level block diagram of a typical 4D/RCS reference model architecture. UAV = Unmanned Air Vehicle, UARV = Unmanned Armed Reconnaissance Vehicle, UGS = Unattended Ground Sensors. 4D/RCS prescribes a hierarchical control principle that decomposed high level commands into actions that employ physical actuators and sensors. The figure for example shows a high level block diagram of a 4D/RCS reference model architecture for a notional Future Combat System (FCS) battalion. Commands flow down the hierarchy, and status feedback and sensory information flows up. Large amounts of communication may occur between nodes at the same level, particularly within the same subtree of the command tree: * At the Servo level : Commands to actuator groups are decomposed into control signals to individual actuators. * At the Primitive level : Multiple actuator groups are coordinated and dynamical interactions between actuator groups are taken into account. * At the Subsystem level : All the components within an entire subsystem are coordinated, and planning takes into consideration issues such as obstacle avoidance and gaze control. * At the Vehicle level : All the subsystems within an entire vehicle are coordinated to generate tactical behaviors. * At the Section level : Multiple vehicles are coordinated to generate joint tactical behaviors. * At the Platoon level : Multiple sections containing a total of 10 or more vehicles of different types are coordinated to generate platoon tactics. * At the Company level : Multiple platoons containing a total of 40 or more vehicles of different types are coordinated to generate company tactics. * At the Battalion level : Multiple companies containing a total of 160 or more vehicles of different types are coordinated to generate battalion tactics. At all levels, task commands are decomposed into jobs for lower level units and coordinated schedules for subordinates are generated. At all levels, communication between peers enables coordinated actions. At all levels, feedback from lower levels is used to cycle subtasks and to compensate for deviations from the planned situations. =4D/RCS control loop= 4D-RCS control loop basic internal structure. At the heart of the control loop through each node is the world model, which provides the node with an internal model of the external world. The world model provides a site for data fusion, acts as a buffer between perception and behavior, and supports both sensory processing and behavior generation. A high level diagram of the internal structure of the world model and value judgment system is shown in the figure. Within the knowledge database, iconic information (images and maps) is linked to each other and to symbolic information (entities and events). Situations and relationships between entities, events, images, and maps are represented by pointers. Pointers that link symbolic data structures to each other form syntactic, semantic, causal, and situational networks. Pointers that link symbolic data structures to regions in images and maps provide symbol grounding and enable the world model to project its understanding of reality onto the physical world. Sensory processing performs the functions of windowing, grouping, computation, estimation, and classification on input from sensors. World modeling maintains knowledge in the form of images, maps, entities, and events with states, attributes, and values. Relationships between images, maps, entities, and events are defined by pointers. These relationships include class membership, ontologies, situations, and inheritance. Value judgment provides criteria for decision making. Behavior generation is responsible for planning and execution of behaviors. =Computational nodes= RCS NODE Internal structure. The 4D/RCS nodes have internal structure such as shown in the figure. Within each node there typically are four functional elements or processes: # behavior generation, # world modeling, # sensory processing, and # value judgment. There is also a knowledge database that represents the node‚Äôs best estimate of the state of the world at the range and resolution that are appropriate for the behavioral decisions that are the responsibility of that node. These are supported by a knowledge database, and a communication system that interconnects the functional processes and the knowledge database. Each functional element in the node may have an operator interface. The connections to the Operator Interface enable a human operator to input commands, to override or modify system behavior, to perform various types of teleoperation, to switch control modes (e.g., automatic, teleoperation, single step, pause), and to observe the values of state variables, images, maps, and entity attributes. The Operator Interface can also be used for programming, debugging, and maintenance. =Five levels of the architecture= Five levels of the 4D/RCS architecture for Demo III. The figure is a computational hierarchy view of the first five levels in the chain of command containing the Autonomous Mobility Subsystem in the 4D/RCS architecture developed for Demo III. On the right of figure, Behavior Generation (consisting of Planner and Executor) decompose high level mission commands into low level actions. The text inside the Planner at each level indicates the planning horizon at that level. In the center of the figure, each map has a range and resolution that is appropriate for path planning at its level. At each level, there are symbolic data structures and segmented images with labeled regions that describe entities, events, and situations that are relevant to decisions that must be made at that level. On the left is a sensory processing hierarchy that extracts information from the sensory data stream that is needed to keep the world model knowledge database current and accurate. The bottom (Servo) level has no map representation. The Servo level deals with actuator dynamics and reacts to sensory feedback from actuator sensors. The Primitive level map has range of 5 m with resolution of 4 cm. This enables the vehicle to make small path corrections to avoid bumps and ruts during the 500 ms planning horizon of the Primitive level. The Primitive level also uses accelerometer data to control vehicle dynamics and prevent rollover during high speed driving. At all levels, 4D/RCS planners are designed to generate new plans well before current plans become obsolete. Thus, action always takes place in the context of a recent plan, and feedback through the executors closes reactive control loops using recently selected control parameters. To meet the demands of dynamic battlefield environments, the 4D/RCS architecture specifies that replanning should occur within about one-tenth of the planning horizon at each level. =Inter-Node Interactions within a Hierarchy= Sensory processing and behavior generation are both hierarchical processes, and both are embedded in the nodes that form the 4D/RCS organizational hierarchy. However, the SP and BG hierarchies are quite different in nature and are not directly coupled. Behavior generation is a hierarchy based on the decomposition of tasks and the assignment of tasks to operational units. Sensory processing is a hierarchy based on the grouping of signals and pixels into entities and events. In 4D/RCS, the hierarchies of sensory processing and behavior generation are separated by a hierarchy of world modeling processes. The WM hierarchy provides a buffer between the SP and BG hierarchies with interfaces to both. Criticisms There have been major criticisms of this architectural form, according to Balakirsky (2003) due to the fact that \\"the planning is performed on a model of the world rather than on the actual world, and the complexity of the computing large plans... Since the world is not static, and may change during this time delay that occurs between sensing, plan conception, and final execution, the validation of the computed plans have been called into question\\".

History In the late summer of 1969, following the release of Truly Fine Citizen, Moby Grape's last album for Columbia, Jerry Miller and Don Stevenson joined with John Barrett (bass) and John \\"Fuzzy\\" Oxendine (drums) to form The Rhythm Dukes.John Oxendine would later play drums with Moby Grape on their Live Grape album (1978). Don Stevenson played guitar, rather than drums. It is speculated that he left the band shortly after its formation for that reason, preferring to remain a drummer.Profile of The Rhythm Dukes; www.bay-area-bands.com. The band came together at Jerry Miller's initiative, at a time when the future of Moby Grape was uncertain. Moby Grape members had been shocked by Bob Mosley's abrupt departure to join the Marines, shortly after the release of Moby Grape '69. This added to uncertainties that commenced at the time of the 1968 departure of Skip Spence from the band, as the result of a six month involuntary psychiatric committal during the course of recording Wow/Grape Jam. The recording of Truly Fine Citizen in 1969 had been similarly strained, in that Columbia Records had imposed a three day limit on recording time, thus demonstrating little support for Moby Grape's future.See Truly Fine Citizen. The band lived together in Santa Cruz and, following Stevenson's departure, was joined by Bill Champlin on organ and vocals. The future of Champlin's band, The Sons of Champlin, was at that time uncertain, similar to the situation which Miller and Stevenson had faced. Champlin, along with Miller, became the group's principal songwriters. The Rhythm Dukes shared the stage with such artists as Albert Collins, Lee Michaels, The Flying Burrito Brothers, Canned Heat, The Grateful Dead and Cat Mother & the All Night Newsboys, generally being second-billed. They recorded one album in 1970, which saw release in 2005 as Flashback.Details of the band and the CD release are accessible here www.rhythmdukes.com. The CD is artist-distributed directly. See also Profile of The Rhythm Dukes www.bay-area-bands.com. The band existed from 1969-1971. Despite Columbia's attitude towards Moby Grape, Miller was still subject to contractual obligations to Columbia, which were disruptive to Rhythm Dukes commitments. Champlin consequently left the band, to continue with the Sons of Champlin. Miller, Barrett and Oxendine continued the band for a short period thereafter, with such musicians as guitarists Russell Dahneke and Ned Torney, the latter being a founding member of the Chocolate Watchband. Miller would later rejoin Stevenson and the other original members of Moby Grape to record 20 Granite Creek, (1971), which effectively ended The Rhythm Dukes. Champlin would continue playing and recording with The Sons of Champlin for the balance of the 1970s, prior to commencing a solo career and later joining Chicago.

Like the other fourteen tracks on the album, it was written by Ray Davies. Background \\"Village Green\\" was recorded during the sessions of Something Else, The Kinks' 1967 predecessor to The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society.Hinman, Doug (2004). p. 114 The track's influence came from Ray Davies's visit to Devon, a rural area in England. This track inspired Davies to use this \\"village green\\" concept as an idea for an album, and it was held back for what would become The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society. This track makes use of orchestral instrumentation, unlike the other tracks from The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society, on which the mellotron was used instead. This is likely because the track was recorded a year before the rest of the album was worked on. It also, in early stages, was planned to be the title track of the album until The Village Green Preservation Society was written. This is proven by a statement made by Dave Davies, which said that the album will be called Village Green. J.H. Tompkins of Pitchfork Media called the track \\"understated\\", noting its \\"bouncing along like a horse and buggy as Ray Davies paints the landscape: 'Out in the country, far from all the soot and noise of the city...'\\" Lyrics The lyrics of \\"Village Green\\" describe a man who grew up in a village green. He met a girl named Daisy, who he kissed \\"by the old oak tree.\\" However, he left the village green to seek stardom. Despite this, he misses the village green, saying that he misses the \\"church, the clock, the steeple\\" and \\"the morning dew, fresh air and Sunday school.\\" However, since he left, the town became a novelty and a tourist attraction, with Americans saying things like \\"'Gawd darn it, Isn't it a pretty scene?'\\" Daisy has married Tom, a former grocer boy, now owner of a grocery. Now, the man wishes to come back to the village green, and hopes to talk to Daisy once again. Release \\"Village Green\\" is most notable for appearing on The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society, but it made several other appearances. In fact, the track did receive a release prior to this album, as it was used in the French LP for \\"Mister Pleasant\\". Also, it was released as a single in Japan, with \\"Animal Farm (the track that preceded \\"Village Green\\" on The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society) as its B-side. It also appeared on the compilation album Picture Book, and an alternate version with an alternate orchestral overdub appeared 2004 Sanctuary Records special deluxe edition of The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society. There is no record of The Kinks ever performing the song live in the 1960s, however an instrumental version was used as the 'Village Green Overture' for some 1973 shows. Ray Davies has also performed the vocal version of the song on his solo tours.

James Henry Gardiner (1848 ‚Äì 9 December 1921) was an early Australian rules football administrator, footballer and public servant. He is primarily known for the pivotal role he played in establishing the North Melbourne Football Club, which now competes in the Australian Football League. Early life For a man who played such a vital role in the nurturing of Australia's national code of football, it is surprising to learn that James Gardiner actually began his life fairly inconspicuously in the London borough of Deptford, far away from his adopted home of Australia. Born close to the famous Royal Dockyards in 1848, Gardiner had a difficult start to his life growing up during a troubled period in European history. Early on in his childhood his family and sibling made the move from England to the brighter shores of Australia. They settled in North Melbourne where Gardiner spent his childhood on the future site of the Arden St Oval. Founding the North Melbourne Football Club In 1869 at the young age of 21 years, James Gardiner took a leading part in launching a small sporting enterprise that would later burgeon into one of Australia's top football clubs ‚Äì the North Melbourne Football Club. By helping to establish a club where the local lads of the district could socialise and keep fit, he had unknowingly started something that would grow to become much bigger. Over several decades, James Gardiner would go on to occupy almost every position within the club from president to vice president to treasurer, secretary, chairman of the match committee and position of delegate to the VFA. He would maintain an active involvement in club affairs, often at great expense to his personal health. =Football career= Not much is known of James Gardiner's early exploits as a player. The only contemporary account that survived to this day is an account from The Footballer which described Gardiner as being: > \\"A 'Tiger' at working, never tires at following, is a grand place and drop > kick, but a trifle rough in play\\" His approach to the game earnt him the nickname Tiger, which stuck with him through later life and characterised his attitude to how he dealt with sport and public life. Personal life Gardiner was married twice, and was blessed with having six sons and five daughters. His family lived in the former North Melbourne sub-division of East Hotham. Gardiner also had a huge commitment to public life and the community, serving as a local councillor of the City of North Melbourne from 1892 to 1899 and again from 1902 to 1905. in 1894 he was elected Mayor of the City. As city father he helped establish many of the landmarks around North Melbourne in his roles with the Public Works, Markets and Parks Committee. Gardiner continued to serve the North Melbourne community as representative of the Hopetoun Ward after 1905, when the City of North Melbourne was merged with the City of Melbourne. =Push to join the VFL= Gardiner's abiding vision was to see the club he helped found, rise to compete on the greatest stage in the land. Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Gardiner was at the forefront of several pushes to have North Melbourne admitted to the VFL. In his position as local councillor, senior football figure and respected public servant in Melbourne, Gardiner campaigned vigorously on North's behalf. By 1921 North was in crisis, after a planned merger between North and rivals Essendon failed to materialise. The end result was that North found itself without a league to play in for the 1922 season. Rising from his sick bed ‚Äì at great risk to his personal health ‚Äì Gardiner headed an ultimately unsuccessful delegation to the VFL to plead to have North accepted to that competition. =Death= Gardiner sadly would not live to see the fulfillment of his dream. Several weeks later he died, on 9 December 3 years before North were promoted to the VFL. He was laid to rest by his old friend Joseph Allison and his body now lies at the Fawkner Cemetery.

It should not be confused with the pathologically unrelated, yet similar sounding, mesonephric adenoma. Symptoms The symptoms may be similar to those classically associated with renal cell carcinoma, and may include polycythemia, abdominal pain, hematuria and a palpable mass. Mean age at onset is around 40 years with a range of 5 to 83 years and the mean size of the tumour is 5.5 cm with a range 0.3 to 15 cm (1). Polycythemia is more frequent in MA than in any other type of renal tumour. Of further relevance is that this tumour is more commonly calcified than any other kidney neoplasm.Davis Cj jr, Barton JH, Sesterhenn IA, Mostofi FK (1995) Metanephric adenoma. Clinicopathologic study of fifty patients. Am J Surg Pathol 19(10):1101-1114. Surgery is curative and no other treatment is recommended. There is so far no evidence of metastases or local recurrence.

Micrograph of a metanephric adenoma, right of image, showing the characteristic features (round nuclear membrane, no nucleoli, and fine chromatin). Normal kidney is seen on the left of the image. Kidney biopsy. PAS stain. Metanephric adenoma is diagnosed histologically. The tumours can be located at upper pole, lower pole and mid-hilar region of the kidney; they are well circumscribed but unencapsulated, tan pink, with possible cystic and hemorrhagic foci. They show a uniform architecture of closely packed acinar or tubular structures of mature and bland appearance with scanty interposed stroma.Bostwick DG, Eble JN (2008) Urologic Surgical Pathology. St Louis, Mosby, p118. Cells are small with dark staining nuclei and inconspicuous nucleoli. Blastema is absent whereas calcospherites may be present. Glomeruloid figures are a striking finding, reminiscent of early fetal metenephric tissue. The lumen of the acini may contain otherwise epithelial infoldings or fibrillary material but it is quite often empty. Mitoses are conspicuously absent. In the series reported by Jones et al. tumour cells were reactive for Leu7 in 3 cases of 5, to vimentine in 4 of 6, to cytocheratin in 2 of 6, to epithelial membrane antigen in 1 of 6 cases and muscle specific antigen in 1 of 6.Jones EC, Pins M, Dickersin GR, Young RH (1995) Metanephric adenoma of the kidney. A clinicopathological, immunohistochemical, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and electron microscopic study of seven cases. Am J Surg Pathol 19(6):615-626. Olgac et al. found that intense and diffuse immunoreactivity for alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) is useful in differentiating renal cell carcinoma from MA but a panel including AMACR, CK7 and CD57 is better in this differential diagnosis.Olgac S, Hutchinson B, Tickoo SK, Reuter VE (2006) Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase as a marker in the differential diagnosis of metanephric adenoma. Mod Pathol 19:218-224. Differential diagnosis may be quite difficult indeed as exemplified by the three malignancies initially diagnosed as MA that later metastasized, in the report by Pins et al.Pins MR, Jones EC, Martul EV, Kamat BR, Umlas J, Renshaw AA (1999) Metanephric adenoma-like tumours of the kidney. Report of three malignancies with emphasis on discriminating features. Arch Pathol Lab Med. 123:415-420. =Cytogenetic characteristics= Brunelli et al. stated that genetic analysis of chromosome 7, 17, and Y may facilitate discrimination of MA from papillary renal cell carcinoma in difficult cases. Their study showed that MA lacks the frequent gain of chromosomes 7 and 17 and losses of the Y chromosome that are typical of papillary renal cell neoplasms, suggesting that MA is not related to renal cell carcinoma and papillary adenoma.Brunelli M, Eble JN, Zhang S, Martignoni G, Cheng L (2003) Metanephric adenoma lacks the gains of chromosomes 7 and 17 and loss of Y that are typical of papillary renal cell carcinoma and papillary adenoma. Mod Pathol 16(10):1060-1063. Treatment As metanephric adenomas are considered benign, they can be left in place, i.e. no treatment is needed. History MA has been described in the past under other names such as n√©phrome n√©phronog√®ne, metanephroider Nierentumor and nephroblastomartiges Nierenadenom (5) but the term metanephric adenoma was suggested by Brisigotti, Cozzutto et al. in 1992 and then widely accepted.

The terminology and extent of each cut varies from country to country. There are between four and six primal cuts, which are the large parts in which the pig is first cut: the shoulder (blade and picnic), loin, belly (spare ribs and side) and leg.Cattleman's Beef Board & National Cattlemen's Beef Association. Uniform Retail Meat Identity Standards . Retrieved 11 July 2007. These are often sold wholesale, as are other parts of the pig with less meat, such as the head, feet and tail. Retail cuts are the specific cuts which are used to obtain different kinds of meat, such as tenderloin and ham. There at least 25 Iberian pork cuts, including jam√≥n. Cuts=Head= The head of the pig can be used to make brawn, stocks, and soups. After boiling, the ears can be fried or baked and eaten separately. The cheeks can be cured and smoked to make jowls, known as carrillada or carrileja in Spanish-speaking countries. The face of Iberian pigs is known as pestorejo or careta, and it includes the ears and snout (morro). The lower parts of the head are the neck (papada) and the amygdalae (casta√±etas). The tongue, which weighs around 250 grams, is also eaten. =Blade shoulder= Pork shoulders. Above the front limbs and behind the head is the shoulder blade. It can be boned out and rolled up as a roasting joint, or cured as \\"collar bacon\\". Also known as spare rib roast and joint, it is not to be confused with the rack of spare ribs from the front belly. Pork butt, despite its name, is from the upper part of the shoulder. The Boston butt, or Boston-style shoulder cut, comes from this area and may contain the shoulder blade. Mexican carnitas and Iberian aguja are also sourced from this part. Between the aguja and the lomo (loin) is the presa, which is considered the finest cut of Iberian pork. Two well-marbled 600 g cuts of presa are obtained from each Iberian pig. Two smaller 100 g cuts known as pluma are obtained from beneath the presa. The Italian coppa is obtained from the top of the shoulder. =Shoulder arm picnic= The arm shoulder can be cured on the bone to make a ham-like product or be used in sausages. The hands (or paletas in Ib√©rico pigs) refer to the front legs, as opposed to the hind legs, which are hams or jamones. Between the paleta and the belly is a 150-200 g cut known as secreto which is very popular in Spain. =Loin= Pork chops sold in Paris. The loin can be cured to make back bacon or Canadian- style bacon. The loin and belly can be cured together to make a side of bacon. The loin can also be divided up into roasts (blade loin roasts, centre loin roasts, and sirloin roasts come from the front, centre, or rear of the loin), back ribs (also called baby back ribs, or riblets), pork cutlets, and pork chops (chuletas). A pork loin crown roast is arranged into a circle, either boneless or with rib bones protruding upward as points in a crown. Pork tenderloin, removed from the loin, should be practically free of fat. It is known as lomo in Spain, where it is most often prepared as a filete or cured as a ca√±a de lomo. This high-quality meat shows a very ordered arrangement of muscle cells that can cause light diffraction and structural coloration. =Fatback= The subcutaneous fat and skin on the back (fatback) are used to make pork rinds, a variety of cured \\"meats\\", lardons, and lard. British pork scratchings and Hispanic chicharrones are also prepared from this cut. =Spare ribs= Spare ribs are taken from the pig's ribs and the meat surrounding the bones. St. Louis‚Äìstyle spareribs have the sternum, cartilage and skirt meat removed. The term abanico is used to refer to the ribs of Iberian pigs. It is very fatty and commonly barbecued. =Belly or side= Korean pork belly cuts, similar to bacon. The belly, although a fattier meat, can be used for steaks or diced as stir-fry meat. Pork belly may be rolled for roasting or cut for streaky bacon. It is the source of Italian pancetta and Spanish panceta. =Legs or hams= carved jam√≥n. Although any cut of pork can be cured, technically speaking only the back leg is entitled to be called a ham. Legs and shoulders, when used fresh, are usually cut bone-in for roasting, or leg steaks can be cut from the bone. Three common cuts of the leg include the rump (upper portion), centre, and shank (lower portion). The ham of Iberian pigs is known as jam√≥n. =Ham hock= The joint between the feet and the leg, known as ham hock or pork knuckles, is cooked in many European countries, including Austria (stelze), Czech Republic (koleno), Germany (eisbein and schweinshaxe), Hungary (cs√ºl√∂k), Poland (golonka), Spain (codillo), Sweden (Ffl√§skl√§gg) and Switzerland (w√§dli). =Trotters= Both the front and hind trotters can be cooked and eaten. They are colloquially known as \\"pigs feet\\" in the Southern United States and as manitas de cerdo in Spanish-speaking regions. =Chitterlings= The intestines (chitterlings) and other internal organs (offal) are often boiled or stewed. The testicles (criadillas) are also eaten. =Tail= The tail has very little meat as it is mostly composed of connective tissue. It can be roasted or fried, which makes the skin crisp and the bone soft. It has a strong flavour. Leonese botillo is made of chopped tail, ribs and bones, which are seasoned, stuffed in the cecum and smoked.

His father, a prominent merchant, was also the American consul. Janson graduated with a degree in theology from the University of Christiania during 1865. Although he had been trained in theology, he was not ordained into the Church of Norway. He traveled extensively in Europe and upon his return to Norway became popular as a teacher and author.Norwegian Emigrants with University Training. 1830-1880 (Oystein Ore. Norwegian-American Historical Association. Volume 19: Page 160) Career In 1876, Kristofer Janson's three-act drama, Amerikanske fantasier, was issued in Chicago by Skandinaven, which hailed its publication as a red- letter day for Norwegians in America. Both Rasmus B. Anderson and H. H. Boyesen were subsequently instrumental in arranging a lecture tour of the Norwegian immigrant community in the United States. Janson came to the United States during September, 1879 at the start of a successful six month lecture tour.Kristofer Jansen's Lecture Tour, 1879-80 ( Nina Draxten. Norwegian- American Historical Association. Volume 22: Page 18) Janson subsequently relocated his family to the United States. His home soon became a cultural center. It was here as Janson's secretary that the future Norwegian author Knut Hamsun got his initial impressions of American cultural life. During this period Janson wrote several novels and short stories often attacking the orthodoxy of the Synod of the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.The Promise of America (Norwegian-American Historical Association) Norwegian writer Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson had encouraged Janson to go to the United States and become a Unitarian pastor for the Norwegian immigrant settlements. Janson was ordained in a ceremony which took place in 1881 in Third Unitarian Church in Chicago. He was subsequently asked by the American Unitarian Association to serve as minister among Scandinavian settlers in Minnesota.The link between the Unitarians in Norway 1895 and today (Unitarian Church in Norway. May 04, 2009) He founded the Free Christian Church of Minneapolis, later known as the Nazareth Church, and also established the Nora Free Christian Church in Hanska, Minnesota.

He is known primarily for his work in collage, and has been described as similar to Keith Piper and Isaac Julien in his output. Some of his pieces depict boxers, such as Jack Johnson and Mohammad Ali. Donkor has been the subject of numerous solo exhibitions, both in the United States and in Europe, and was Ghana's representative to the 2001 Venice Biennale. His work is in the collection of the National Museum of African Art at the Smithsonian Institution.  Introduction  Godfried Donkor was born in Ghana in 1964, then moved to London, England, in 1973 when he was eight years old. Although known for his painting and collage work, Donkor's original intention as an artist, from the age of 14, was to be a fashion designer. It was only at the urging of his teachers to try a different medium that he purchased some paint and brushes and began painting. Soon afterwards, he switched his entire focus to painting and was from thereon out a visual artist, but still with a fondness for fashion design, and sought a way to bridge the two throughout his career. After finding his new medium, Donkor began to study art and art history at Saint Martin's College of Art. After receiving his BA in Fine Art, he went on to attend postgraduate courses in the Fine Arts at Escola Massana in Barcelona, Spain, before completing an MA in African Art History from the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London, in 1995. Using a variety of methods, Donkor works in mixed-media creating painting, collage, and printmaking as well as video, photography and print works. Donkor's work inspiration comes from the historical and sociological issues shared in the history of the African and European people. = Influence and style = Taking inspiration from the people of Africa and Europe, Donkor's influences encompass topics in relation to historical events and social issues. Social issues, the commercialization of the human and the rise of the African American, are the most common themes used in his art. Working mostly in collage, he uses mixed-media, including as newspapers, lace, sheet music and other paper materials as a background to majority of his pieces. On top of the background, Donkor layers illustrations and photographic images that often juxtapose one another. The main images in his work usually represent a rise and empowerment of the African-American community, showing a breakthrough of success after a troubling and difficult history. Donkor's interest in collage began when he was a student at St. Martin's College of Art in London, where he instantly connected with the medium. His original intention with collages was as a preparation for his other works and paintings; however, others saw them as works of art in themselves and encouraged himor to continue experimenting. Of his inclination towards collaging, Donkor says: \\"Visual language is intriguing to me and with collage, symbols become a language‚Ä¶ thus it was interesting to me that a language was developing from the images. Collage can be a very expressive medium, very instant and direct, [but] I think I‚Äôm drawn to using images that may seem to be contrasting in a harmonious way.\\" Donkor also works with fabrics and clothing design, separating him from his other types of works. Since the age of 14, he wanted to pursue fashion and was able to bring his love of fashion out through his work. He shows off his fashion design and use of fabric in series such as the Jamestown Masquerade. Many of his pieces showcase an outfit on a mannequin with no head, showing off the art in the fabric and fashion he has created. Donkor also was approached by Puma to design the Football Kits for the Ghana National Football Team in 2012, allowing him to create a design and theme behind his birth nation's team.  Career = Collage series = Donkor describes artists as hoarders, always collecting text and images to be used in later works. His creative process often begins with someone sending him a series of images or text. He often assembles text and images from 1800s literature as a starting point. Donkor plans his layout with these images before beginning the drawing process, as an outline to each collage. He is known for creating juxtapositions between the modern world and the past, comparing Africa, Europe, and the Caribbean. In his series of collages entitled Slave to Champ and Madonnas, Donkor uses images of African Americans in recent history, such as boxers, football players or a pin-up girls, to show the rise of the African American from slavery to success. The variety of characters as well as the rise from the centre of the ship shows that the black ladder to success is not a natural one, but an artificial rise that conforms to a society catered towards white people. Muhammad Ali stands over the illustrated slave ship like a mythic giant, though his stance and facial expression are timid and nonaggressive. Donkor frequently selects images of heroic black figures in these positions as a way to tear down the brutish stereotype of black men and play with notions of black masculinity. These images also suggest that their success, specifically the black sports figures, is rooted in their commodification as entertainment for a white audience. Donkor also has many other collage series such as: The Art of Football, Guns and Bullets and Financial Times Flags 2004‚Äì2008. The Guns and Bullets collection and the Financial Times Flags show a different message, using objects rather than people in his images. The Financial Flags show stock market figures as the background to different nations‚Äô flags, including Saudi Arabia, Israel, Iraq and many others. The Guns and Bullets series have similar backgrounds with market and financial statements with images of guns and ammunition pasted as the focal point. = Paintings = Along with collage, Donkor also has painting series, oil sketches and print series. Keeping with a similar theme of a central character, in the form of an athlete or leader, his paintings are done with oil on canvas, with the addition of a gold-leaf halo around the central figure or figures‚Äô heads. This insertion alludes to Donkor's own relationship to Christianity and recalls early Renaissance commissions for the church. The halo represents a divine and holy figure, showing the African American figure as a higher power similar to a saint. This shows the figures as role models for success and that success is possible no matter where you come from. This technique can be seen in his painting St. Tom Molineaux, which features the famed bare-knuckle boxer. Tom Molineaux‚Äôs image is entirely appropriated from English portrait painter Robert Dighton‚Äôs portrait of him in Donkor‚Äôs own style of painting. The fairly modest portrait would be indistinguishable to Donkor‚Äôs body of work without his insertion of the gold-leaf halo around Molineaux‚Äôs head, elevating him to the saint status provided in the work‚Äôs title. = Lace series = Another material used for Donkor's work has been the incorporation of lace. After living in Nottingham, Donkor created a series called ‚ÄúOnce Upon a Time in the West, There Was Lace‚Äù for Art Exchange and Nottingham Contemporary. Donkor chose lace, which is a symbol of Nottinghams heritage, as a tribute to Nottingham. To continue the integration of lace in his work, Donkor most recently used lace for the EVA International Ireland's Biennial of Contemporary Art in 2016. Donkor used the Rebel Madonna Lace design which has been made from a series of drawings by the artist, inspired by traditional Limerick lace patterns and by images from Donkor's own vision and influence from Ghanaian culture. Building on the shared history of lace production in Ireland and Ghana, Donkor had the lace piece for the exhibition commercially produced in Ghana and hand made in Limerick, Ireland. By incorporating both nations into the production process, Donkor connects their similar lace histories in terms of how the material was being exploited by greater colonial powers. The Rebel Madonna Lace exhibit is made up of a bright orange lace jumpsuit, embroidered with a number on the left side, and a straitjacket. The outfits evoke \\"a penitentiary‚Äôs finest\\", creating \\"a striking visual representation of commercial enslavement as colonial legacy\\". Similar to Donkor's previous works bringing attention to the commodification of the human being, the exhibition boldly critiques ‚Äúempire and exploitation‚Äù in the face of Ireland's colonial legacy. This exhibition is also a call to the craving of lace in West-Africa, more specifically in Ghana, where it is a highly luxurious and expensive material. = Jamestown Masquerade = Donkor's print series Jamestown Masquerade, done in collaboration with designer Allan Davids, shows images of black models in ornately patterned and vibrantly colored clothing, wearing masquerade masks. This series differs the most from the majority of his works, adding live images and vibrant color to his collections as well as working with textiles as a medium. The photograph series combines Donkor's interest in fashion with his painting and design background. The inspiration behind this series came from Donkor's fascination with the classical era, and imagining how classical music could be transformed to a place like Ghana, Trinidad, or Jamaica. The outfits, which Donkor describes more as \\"sculptural pieces\\", were based on 18th-century costumes to further evoke the musical era, and capture his fascination with the weighty past of Africans and their historical presence. This work is Donkor's modernist example of drawing two unique histories together: those of Europe and Africa. = 2010‚ÄìPresent = In 2012, Donkor designed the football kit for the Ghanaian national football team. He was sought out by Puma after showcasing some work at an exhibit during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.Gary Al- Smith, \\"Q&A; with Godfried Donkor,\\" SuperSport, 8 December 2016. Donkor wanted a theme or title for the kit so that it would stand out as another one of his artworks. Donkor researched past Ghana kits ranging from the 1950s to the Youth team. He came up with the theme for the kits \\"Raining Black Stars\\", representing the team raining down on the opponent in unison and used the nation's colors of red, gold and green. Some other themes behind the kit were inspired by how the team he analysed the teams play, \\"they are fearless of any opponent, they move in unison in attack and defence so the idea soon developed of a constellation of Black Stars falling down the kit\\". Donkor continues to work with textiles in addition to his painting and collage work, which can be seen as recently as the 2016 EVA International Biennial in Ireland.

The director is Antarina S.F. Amir. The school is based on the HighScope Research Foundation Development curriculum, of which the institute itself is located in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Sekolah HighScope Indonesia's first location is in Pondok Indah, South Jakarta. At first, the school only included the early childhood program, and during its first days of operation, HighScope Indonesia only had 8 students. A second campus is located on the Aston Jakarta hotel, located somewhere in Kuiningan, South Jakarta. A third campus, now closed, had previously occupied a house that was only a walk away from Pondok Indah Mall. In 2000, High/Scope Indonesia opened the Elementary program, which was previously located in a house in Cilandak, South Jakarta. They started with only one classroom, which doubled to three classrooms prior to moving to a new campus in Jl. TB Simatupang, South Jakarta, in June 2002. In 2005, the Middle School program was opened, allowing 5th grade students to promote to 6th grade, without even having to leave the school. The latest was the High School program, located on the 5th floor on the second building of the campus. The Multiage system Compared to other schools in which classes are grouped according to their grades, Sekolah HighScope Indonesia uses the multiage system, in which classes are grouped according to the student's age. For example, a 6th grade class is mixed with 7th grade students, which ranges from students aged 11‚Äì14 years old, and 8th grade students mixed with 9th grade students, ages ranges from 13 to 16. As a dual language school Since 2003, the school has issued a dual language curriculum, which includes Indonesian and English languages. The Integrated Studies Program Sekolah HighScope Indonesia issues a multi-lesson program, notably notified as the \\"Integrated Studies\\" program. The program alternates English and Indonesian as a provisional topical language. Students are required to make a report, a product, and a slide-show presentation used as a secondary presentation material. High/Scope has been known to have many homeworks to practice their skills while free time is available at each student's place of residence. The High/Scope Approach Sekolah HighScope Indonesia focuses on students learning on real-life activities in daily life, the promotion of technology for learning, and focusing on respect. Since the conception of the Elementary Program in 2000, High/Scope Indonesia has created a simple pledge, which is mandatory to be read every morning. This is what the pledge (the pledge is habits of empowerment) looks like: As a HighScope Student, I will: 1\\\\. Respect everyone and everything 2\\\\. Listen with my heart and mind 3\\\\. Do my best 4\\\\. Take charge and be accountable 5\\\\. Be truthful 6\\\\. Be curious and find solution 7\\\\. Think, act, and reflect 8\\\\. Team up for better results This is not mentioned on Indonesian days, as issued in 2003. Highscope core values of Respect, Responsibility, Excellence, and Integrity, embedded in the school culture, will accompany the child every step of the way towards developing an ethical character And there is a habit of empowerment. 8 Habits of Empowerment are the answer. Respect myself, everyone and everything; Listen with my heart and mind; Optimize my potential and do my best; Take charge and be accountable; Be truthful; Be curious and find solutions; Think, act, and reflect; Team up for better results. 8 simple, progressive mannerisms is all it takes! Highscope Indonesia understand the concerns regarding challenges that await children in the future.

The actual light is above Mean High Water. Its alternating white and red light is visible for . The light is at the end of a reef that extends about south from Deer Island. The location first had a stone beacon in 1832. The first light, a sparkplug type light, was lit in 1890. It cost about $50,000. It included a three-story dwelling, a veranda with boat davits, and a circular parapet. The water supply was a cistern in the base of the structure. A spiral staircase ran from the cellar to the top floor. It had a fixed white light, which was changed to flashing red every thirty seconds and then to the present alternating red and white flashes. The old light gradually deteriorated and was replaced in 1982 by a white fiberglass tower. The white tower raised complaints because it blended in with the background and was hard to see, so the Coast Guard moved it to Great Point Light, Nantucket, as a temporary replacement when that tower was destroyed by a storm in March 1984. A brown fiberglass tower was installed immediately thereafter. While the Spark plug light was interesting, it was much more expensive to maintain than the fiberglass structure. Imported from England, the pole light was the first of its kind in the United States. Between October 2015 and May 2016, the brown tower was dismantled and the light was moved about south of its previous foundation structure.U.S. Coast Guard Local Notice to Mariners, District 1, Week 49/2015, p.12U.S. Coast Guard Local Notice to Mariners, District 1, Week 20/2016, p.12 The new light uses LED technology and sits on a steel skeletal tower, atop four piles.

It was the basis for the film by Takashi Miike released in 1999 and a possible English-language film adaptation.  Plot summary  Aoyama is a documentary maker who has not dated anyone since the death of his wife, Ryoko. He lives a placid existence with his teenage son, Shige, dreaming of remarrying. One day, his best friend Yoshikawa comes up with a plan to hold fake film auditions for young women looking for a breakout role; unbeknownst to them, they are actually auditioning to be considered for a romantic relationship with Aoyama. Of the thousands who apply, Aoyama only has eyes for the young, beautiful Yamasaki Asami - a shy, modest girl whose dreams of becoming a ballerina were cut short by an accident. Aoyama is infatuated by her and instigates several dates with her after the audition. Despite learning about her troubled past, which included consistent abuse as a child by her crippled step-father, Aoyama believes he is falling in love with her. He is given warnings by Yoshikawa that Asami may not be all that she seems, but Aoyama ignores him, seeing only the perfect woman he imagines Yamasaki Asami to be. It is only when it is possibly too late, that Aoyama discovers the horrifying truth about his new girlfriend.  Characters  * Aoyama: Protagonist of the novel, Aoyama is a forty-two year old widower Aoyama sets two goals for himself on the recommendation of a physician. The first goal was to spend as much time as possible with his son Shige, which he considers to be accomplished. The latter goal was to bring an acclaimed East German pipe organist to Japan to hold a free concert, which in reality is a ploy so that he may record the rare concert and sell it on VHS. Aoyama is extremely nostalgic for the Japan of his youth, often complaining about modern music and culture, seeing it as materialistic and boring. * Yamasaki Asami: A beautiful 24-year-old woman and aspiring actress that Aoyama meets during the audition, when he first sees her Aoyama falls instantly in love. During one of their dates Asami reveals that she was a victim of childhood abuse from her step father who used a wheelchair and who believed that Asami wasn't human after giggling at her own father's funeral. At first it seems that Asami had been able to cope with this trauma positively through ballet, but it is revealed that the abuse had left her extremely unstable and violent, often entering into relationships with men only to murder them by severing their feet for \\"lying\\". * Yoshikawa: Aoyama's long time friend and business associate who first introduces Aoyama to the idea of him finding wife under the guise of an audition for a nonexistent film. Yoshikawa is the first character in the novel to distrust Asami after uncovering the fact that her mentor had been dead for nearly a year and a half. * Shige: Aoyama's fifteen year old son and only child of his marriage with Ryoko. Shige is described as being a bright and athletic young man who is considerably popular at his high school. He often acts as a foil to his father. Shige inadvertently causes the events of the novel by asking his father: \\"Why don't you find yourself a new wife, Pops?\\" * Ryoko: Aoyama's wife who dies of viral cancer seven years prior to the novel. Reception Kim Newman, writing for The Independent, compared the English- adaptation of the book to the film of the same name by Takashi Miike, finding that the movie was \\"suggestive about elements the book spells out bluntly. Miike gained a lot from elegantly wrought source material ‚Äì but the book is now in danger of seeming like a draft, or even a screen treatment.\\" Kasia Boddy praised the novel in The Telegraph, stating that Murakami \\"allows author and reader to have it both ways, simultaneously indulging a taste for schlock and some low-level guilt about \\"objectification\\". Nathan Rabin of Artforum opined that \\"Audition depends less on the bracing nastiness of its final twist than on the skillful interplay of the horrific and the mundane\\" and that \\"Murakami is not a subtle writer. He lays out the freshman-level psychology behind Asami's actions with all the ham-fisted literalness of the psychiatrist explaining how poor Norman Bates went a little batty after murdering his mother and her lover in Psycho. But if Audition skirts sexism, it's still enormously savvy about the roles class, age, social status, and gender play in romantic relationships, as well as about the queasy voyeurism and exploitation endemic to the entertainment industry.\\"  References  External links  * Review by Irvine Welsh 1997 Japanese novels Japanese- language novels Japanese horror novels Japanese novels adapted into films Novels by Ry≈´ Murakami ","title":"Audition (novel)"},{"id":"23848382","text":"Li Lingyu (born 9 April 1963, in Shanghai) is a Chinese singer and actress.

Life Alexa Hepburn was born in Leicester. Because her father was a telecoms engineer involved in modernising exchanges she moved between 12 different schools in the North of England and Scotland. She did an undergraduate degree in Philosophy and Psychology at the University of Dundee. She did her PhD at Glasgow Caledonian University supervised by Gerda Siann. This focused on school bullying, with a particular interest in the way that traditional research had isolated pupils and their problematic personalities, rather than seeing them as part of a broader system of relationships, including teachers and parents. This was combined with a poststructuralist approach to psychological methods, to power, and to the nature of persons. She was awarded her PhD in 1995 and she held teaching positions at Napier University, Staffordshire University and then Nottingham Trent University. After being a Leverhulme Fellow in 2002 she was appointed to a lectureship and then senior lectureship at Loughborough University. In 2009 she was promoted to Reader in Conversation Analysis, and in 2015 to Professor of Conversation Analysis. In September 2015 she took up a position of Research Professor in the Communication Department at Rutgers University, New Jersey, USA. Work Her early research combined her interests in critical psychology and theory with an empirical examination of school bullying. She explored the relationship between Derrida's deconstruction and the nature of psychology and considered the implications of relativism for feminism. Her work was influenced by, and influenced, the approach known as discursive psychology. Her critical concerns were brought together in her Introduction to Critical Social Psychology published in 2003. This integrated and evaluated critical work inspired by marxism, poststructuralism, feminism and discourse analysis. In the years after this she was heavily involved in editing two collections jointly with Sally Wiggins, one a special issue of the journal Discourse and Society and the other a volume for Cambridge University Press, Discursive Research in Practice. From 2005 she has undergone extensive training in conversation analysis, attending workshops taught by Emanuel Schegloff, John Heritage and Gene Lerner in UCLA and masters level modules in conversation analysis at the University of York taught by Celia Kitzinger. Since 2000 she has been working with a large corpus of phone calls to the UK National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children child protection helpline, originally collected as part of her Leverhulme Fellowship. Her work focused on the way the calls are opened, the way emotion is expressed and responded to, and the way shared understandings are developed and contested in the course of sequences of advice. This programme of work has resulted in a series of articles. Much of this work is collaborative with Jonathan Potter. She has become expert in transcription and has developed Gail Jefferson's basic system for transcribing talk to encompass phenomena associated with crying and upset (sobbing, sniffing, tremulous delivery). This is part of a broader concern with the way emotion becomes something live in interaction. Recent developments Her recent work has been focused on interaction in family mealtimes involving young children. This has involved working with video recordings of meals and studying basic actions such as requests, directives, admonishments and threats. Like the rest of her work this is designed to have an applied focus yet also provide a critique of mainstream individualist positions in psychology. This has developed into a broader concern with the concept of socialization and how it can be specified more precisely using particular sequences of interaction. In addition to these topics she has been involved in a series of studies of the role of tag questions in interaction. Her focus has been on the way tag questions can be used to both build and contest intersubjectivity. She has also been working on technical features of indexical repair - conversational moments where speakers 'fix' their own talk before another speaker can take their turn. Although highly technical, these phenomena have implications for the way basic issues in language and cognition are understood. Over the years, her applied work has resulted in the development of workshops for helpline practitioners. She is currently developing this line of applied interaction work at Rutgers, and extending it into the study of medical communication. References * Hepburn, A. (1999).

They typically play in a Thrash Metal style, and often take inspiration from historical figures and events for their music. The Band currently consists of Founder/Lead Singer and Bassist Pete Altieri, Drummer Travis Waterman, Les Aldridge and Jeremy Meister on Guitars. The band has released 3 full-length CDs(Flesh of the Weak, Unfit for Human Occupancy, and This Side Towards Enemy) and 2 demos, as well as being featured on many compilations and soundtracks. They are currently in the process of recording their highly anticipated fourth CD Splatter Pattern. History=Formation and Demos= Low Twelve began in July 1998 as founder Pete Altieri, decided to end his 10-year departure from heavy metal. He decided to name the band Low Twelve after reading the phrase in an old book on Freemasonry, which simply meant midnight. It can also mean the very end of something, like the moments right before death. The band is based out of Bloomington Illinois, a city of about 50,000 in Central Illinois. Pete began to write material, develop the logo and band presentation as he found guitarists Tim McCleland and Les Aldridge. Together with original drummer Steve Chestney, Low Twelve practised a rigorous schedule to perform their d√©but show at Club Edge in Bloomington Illinois on February 6, 1999. It would be the first of many brutal live shows. Shortly after that show, the band released their d√©but 4-song demo, \\"Blunt Force Trauma\\". The demo received praise by metal magazines worldwide and sold nearly 1,000 copies. After only a couple of months, the band decided to hit the studio again and released the EP, \\"Kill Floor\\", and sold another 1,000 copies of it by hand duplicating and assembling each one! Several cuts from \\"Kill Floor\\" dominated the metal charts on mp3.com and they began to get airplay in stations throughout the US as well as Germany, The Netherlands, and beyond. In 1999 Pete Altieri founded Heavycore, a union of heavy bands worldwide. =Flesh of the Weak= Steve Chestney left the band and was replaced in November 1999 with Wes Pollock. Dubbed the \\"Kill Floor Kid\\", Wes brought a new slant on the style of the band. The new material began to transform into a faster and more intricate sound. In June 2000, Low Twelve recorded the full length cd, \\"Flesh of the Weak\\". The 70-minute CD was released in December 2000 as they supported Pro-Pain on the \\"Round 6\\" tour for a few dates. Reviews continue to pour in for \\"Flesh of the Weak\\" and many of the songs have appeared in other formats. \\"Twelve\\" and \\"Trench\\" were selected for the Siren Jukebox 2.0 software. \\"Brutal World\\" was featured in the movie trailer and during the film \\"Jigsaw\\" released on Full Moon Pictures on DVD. \\"Jigsaw\\" was released nationwide throughout Hollywood Video and Family Video stores. In addition, \\"Brutal World\\" and \\"Sex Sin Sermon\\" was on the soundtrack for Falcon Videos \\"Horrortales 666\\" that came out in early 2003. During the summer of 2002, the band embarked on a tour to New York City and back - as they tore it up night after night, gaining new Twelve Heads in mass. Low Twelve shows are known for being loud, rough and nasty in the pits. Many fans comment on how tight the band is live, and how the songs are pulled off with precision and intensity. The band thrives in a live environment, when their amps are up full tilt and providing the necessary concussion up front. In June 2001, Pete Altieri was diagnosed with cancer and went under emergency surgery to remove the tumour. Tests later showed Pete still had many tumours left, and so the cancer had spread. The only option being chemotherapy, Pete endured the treatments while continuing to play live shows and rehearse twice a week. During the entire summer, the only show Low Twelve missed was on the day of Pete's emergency surgery. Trips were made to Missouri and Wisconsin, and the support from the fans was a huge reason for Pete's persistence and determination to beat the cancer. With a sigh of relief, on September 11, 2001 Pete found out the cancer was gone. Each check up shows the cancer remains gone, and his health slowly has improved. =Touring and Live DVD= Tim McCleland left the band in October 2001 and after a short period of try-outs, the band decided to remain a three piece. After posting a poll on the site, 2/3 of fans voted to keep the band intact, and to not get another guitar player. At live shows, the fans loved the new approach, and with some adjustments, the band was able to perform many of their classic tunes. Sadly, Tim McCleland committed suicide on February 26, 2002, and even though he was not a member of the band, he was still a good friend to every member of Low Twelve. It was a very rough time, but the band forged on yet again. Pete, Les, and Wes reached down and decided the only thing to do was continue to fight. After dealing with the adversity of Pete's cancer fight and Tim's untimely death - Low Twelve felt stronger than ever. In the summer of 2003 Low Twelve released its next CD, \\"Unfit For Human Occupancy\\" with 5 newly recorded songs and 2 live tracks with Tim still playing. The reviews have been strong and the metal media has praised it. The CD was released with a DVD entitled \\"Maggot Ridden Rotting Movie\\", but it had to be removed from the jewel case due to a legal problem that arose. To avoid litigation, Low Twelve agreed to remove the DVD and sell only the \\"Unfit\\" . =This Side Toward Enemy and Label Debut= Low Twelve continued to tour and play live shows, as well as participate in benefits for various causes. In 2005, Pete rallied the Heavycore bands to mail CDs to soldiers in Iraq. So many cds were sent in that the unit had a \\"Heavycore night\\" each week where the metal head soldiers cranked up their favourite Heavycore bands in their day room. In late 2004 they recorded a new full-length CD, This Side Toward Enemy, and released it on Rotting Corpse Records in February 2006. The band signed the deal with the Chicago-based label in January 2006 and has already reaped the benefits of having a hard working indie label on your side. The sales have been strong, especially in Europe and Asia, as the metal media raves about the epic release. The CD boasts 12 new tracks that the band recorded/produced/mixed/mastered themselves, a remix of \\"Twelve\\" and a video for the song \\"Kill Everything\\" - which features vocals by hardcore legend Gary Meskil of Pro-Pain. Other tracks on the CD feature vocalists from other Heavycore bands. =Recent Activity and Splatter Pattern= In March 2008 Les Aldridge decided to pack it in after 10 years on guitar duties, and so the band decided to draft two new guitar players to go back to the original two- guitar attack. Jeremy Meister, formerly of the Breed of Sedition/Human Hatemachine/Killborn has joined forces with the band. Soon after Meister was added, another fret-ripper - Dan Steinlicht (Zero Shift, formerly of Redeeming Damnation) was approached and welcomed the challenge. Already the Low Twelve sound is changing - but even heavier than before with two guitar players in tow. Unfortunately, after only 18 months in the band, Low Twelve parted ways with guitarist Dan Steinlicht and Les Aldridge rejoined bringing the sound full circle with the Meister/Aldridge combination. Both guitarist having distinct cutting tones but together their sound steps into the world of other epic two guitar bands rarely matched and often never duplicated. Despite the challenge, Low Twelve has already begun recording their 4th CD release with \\"Splatter Pattern\\". This new and exciting project began in the early Spring of 2009 and continues on likely into the fall. Meister will play a few of the guitar solos on the CD and a guest guitarist will play the others. On August 22, 2009 Les Aldridge rejoined Low 12. In November 2010, Wes Pollock decided to leave the band to pursue a career in the audio engineering industry. Low Twelve decided to have friend of the band, Travis Waterman, step in to replace Wes on drums; ultimately dubbed the new breed of Low Twelve.

In their heyday Kolibri, according to rock historian Andrey Burlaka, combined ironic high posturing with touchingly humane attitude, writing and performing songs that were described variously as exquisite, depressive, extravagant, romantic, naive, sophisticated and decadent.Kolibri –ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –ë—É—Ä–ª–∞–∫–∞ The band released six studio albums which were well received by critics both in Europe and in Russia but never had any commercial success.[ www.allmusic.com Kolibri] Natasha Pivovarova, Kolibri's founding member, left in 1998 to form her own band Sous (The Sauce).

She invited to join in six other girls, who were associated with the Leningrad Rock Club in one way or another but haven't had any stage experience, and suggested they'd form a kind of musical theater and perform cover versions in a cabaret/avant-garde/post-rock fashion. On 8 March 1988 the septet premiered their Vacation of Love set (its title referring to the Japanese film) at the Leningrad Rock Club. According to critic Andrey Burlaka the concert caused furore and the girls became the overnight sensation of the city's cultural scene. By the time of their next gig, though, Kolibri were five: Pivovarova, Yelena Yudanova, Irina Sharovatova, Olga Feshchenko, and Inna Volkova. Soon the band members started writing their own material. =Debut= In November 1989, Kolibri went into Aquarium's portable studio to record their –ê–º–µ—Ä–∏–∫–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è –∂–µ–Ω–∞ (American Wife) demo and next month started working on their debut album in the Titanic Studio with producer Alexandr Titov (ex-Aquarium). Among those taking part in the recording were Oleg Sakmarov (flute, oboe), Piotr Akimov (cello), Alexey Ratzen (drums) and two Televizor's guitarists, Alexandr Beliaev and Maxim Kuznetzov. In 1990 the debut album –ú–∞–Ω–µ—Ä–∞ –ø–æ–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è (Manie‚Ä≤ra Povede‚Ä≤niya, Manner of Conduct) was released, first unofficially, then a year later on FeeLee Records in Russia. Two years later it was released in the USA. The band went on tour using the instrumental studio backing track and asserting (according to Allmusic) \\"their nonconformity with theatrical stage antics and costuming, in their case identical black ballet outfits and colored gloves.\\" =The 'classic' years= 1991 saw Kolibri performing at the Rock Club's 10th Anniversary concert and at the Interdelo Festival in Novosibirsk, alongside N.O.M., Orkestr A and The Shamen among others. They took part in Nantes' Leningrad Days (L–µs Allumees fest) and later played in Germany, Finland and Sweden. In 1992 Videofilm company made a musical film –ö–æ–ª–∏–±—Ä–∏ –≤ –ü–∞—Ä–∏–∂–µ –∏ –î–æ–º–∞ (Kolibri in Paris and at Home). Demonstrated occasionally in Petersburg theaters throughout 1990s, it has never been released on video. By this time Olga Feshchenko has left the group and settled in Paris. Kolibri's second album –ú–∞–ª–µ–Ω—å–∫–∏–µ —Ç—Ä–∞–≥–µ–¥–∏–∏ (Ma‚Ä≤lenkie Trage‚Ä≤dii, Little Tragedies) was recorded in 1992, with the session musician and arranger Yuri Sobolev and guitarist Aleksandr Gnatyuk. A song from the album, \\"Zholty List Osenni\\" (Yellow Leaf of Autumn), written and sung by Elena Udanova, became Russian radio hit. On 8 March 1993, the group celebrated their fifth anniversary by playing in Slava Polunin's show. In 1994 Kolbri recorded –ù–∞–π–¥–∏ –¥–µ—Å—è—Ç—å –æ—Ç–ª–∏—á–∏–π (Find Ten Differences). Produced by Andrei Muratov of DDT fame and released by Triary Records, it is regarded as their best. This time they were supported in the studio by bassist Vyacheslav Koshelev, ex-Auktyon drummer Igor Cheridnik, various members of Prepinaki (the latter's frontman Alex Lushin was Natasha Pivovarova's husband at the time) and Aleksandr Belyaev of Nautilus Pompilius. The experimental –ë–µ—Å –°–∞—Ö–∞—Ä–∞ (Bes Sahara, a pun which could mean both 'Without Sugar' or 'Sugar Demon', its working title having been - 'Princesses Don't Poo'), recorded with Tequilajazzz was released by Gala Records. The members of Tequilajazzz joined the girls on stage to become for a while Kolibri's backing band. In 1998 Kolibri starred in Aleksandr Bashirov's film Zheleznaya Pyata Oligarkhyi (The Iron Heel of Oligarchy).translated for some reason as 'The Iron Heel of Communism' by Allmusic In May of that year the band joined the line-up of Sergey Kuryokhin's 2nd annual S.K.I.F. Festival organized in New York City by David Gross, the good friend of the latter. =Pivovarova's departure= In December 1998 Natasha Pivovarova left the band to pursue a solo career. She went on to work as a producer for Molochny Shake (another all-girl group which some critics labeled \\"the teenage Kolibri\\") and sang duets with Alexandr Lushin and his band. In January 2000 she formed a new group (or \\"the association\\" as they preferred to call themselves) named –°–æ—É—Å (Sous, The Sauce). In less than a year Kolibri re-emerged with the two new members, Oleg Emirov (keyboards and arrangements; ex-Golye) and Andrey Gradovich (guitar). After a year of touring Europe the reformed Kolibri made their first Saint Petersburg appearance; their 24 December 2000 concert in Teatr Estrady garnered fine reviews. The album, –õ—é–±–æ–≤—å –∏ –µ—ë –∫–æ–Ω–µ—á–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ (Lyubov I yeyo konechnosti, Love and its Limbs) recorded in the Signal Studios with producer Sergey Rusanov (ex-Ulitzy, Televizor) was shelved to be released a year later by Real Records, almost simultaneously with their next work, Troi, a collaboration with the Volkovtrio members, Vladimir Volkov and Svyatoslav Kurashov. In the course of the next two years Kolibri played several festivals (including S.K.I.F.) and appeared in studio compilations (like the two Aquarium members tribute ‚Äî first Dyusha Romanov's, then Boris Grebenshchikov). The band's 15th anniversary concerts in Moscow and Petersburg saw Natasha Pivovarova joining her ex-colleagues on stage. By this time Emirov has left and Kolibri joined forces with Soundscript 33, an instrumental trio led by saxophonist and composer Dmitry Fyodorov. Natasha Pivovarova, Kolibri's founding member, died in a car crash in Crimea, Ukraine, in September 2007.

Matteucci wrote of the trip \\"You can imagine the state of mind of Gessi, who has never known fear, and always conquered with few and brave soldiers; here, near to the goal, and imprisoned by a swollen river, and with few fighting-men, he is like a wounded lion.\\"Bompiani, Explorers, p. 34. Matteucci published a history of the journey, Soudan and Galla, on his return. In December 1878, Matteucci travelled to Abyssinia with Gustavus Bianchi at the request of the Society for Commercial Explorations in Milan.Bompiani, Explorers, p. 47.Bompiani, Explorers, p. 44. They travelled through Africa, heading to the northern border of Shewa. By the end of this expedition, Matteucci had succumbed to fever attributed to malaria four times.Bompiani, Explorers, p. 45. The journey was chronicled in Matteucci's book In Abyssinia. Matteucci's last journey, started in spring 1880, took him from the Red Sea to the Atlantic Ocean, passing through Egypt, Darfur, and Wadai en route to an English settlement at the mouth of the Niger River. It was sponsored by the Geographical Society of Rome.Bompiani, Explorers, p. 48. Prince Giovanni Borghese, the youngest member of that family, accompanied the expedition as far as Wadai. While in Wadai, Matteucci and a young naval officer accompanying him, Lieutenant Alfonso Maria Massari, convinced the Sultan of Wadai to spare the lives of 400 Italian prisoners of war. The Sultan had imprisoned the explorers for 113 days before permitting them to enter his kingdom. The explorers travelled from Sawakin on the Red Sea over Khartum, through Darfur, south along Lake Chad, through Kanem-Bornu, through Kano and Bida, to the delta of the River Niger. They covered an average of a day, and a total distance of .Bompiani, Explorers, p. 50. On the Gulf of Guinea, Matteucci's expedition found passage on a ship to England. Matteucci left few notes and letters from this trip, because of his fevers, inflammation of the eyes, and periods of imprisonment along the way.Bompiani, Explorers, p. 49. Death Following the final expedition, Matteucci arrived in Liverpool and took the train to London, where he suffered a severe fever. Despite the aid of doctors, he died the following day, 8 August 1881, in a London hotel. His body was taken to Bologna by Massari.

It is directed by Giuseppe Capotondi, produced by Francesca Cima and Nicola Giuliano, and stars Filippo Timi and Kseniya Rappoport. Principal photography began in October 2008 in Turin, Italy. The film opened in Italy on October 9, 2009, after premiering in competition at Venice Film Festival in September 2009, where it eventually won the Volpi Cup award for Best Actress for Rappoport. It was also screened at the 2009 Toronto Film Festival.http://www.tiff.net/filmsandschedules/films/doublehour Samuel Goldwyn Films released The Double Hour in the US on April 15, 2011. Plot Sonia (Ksenia Rappoport), a maid in a hotel in Turin, is cleaning a guest's bathroom when the guest apparently jumps out the bedroom window to her death. Later, Sonia attends a speed dating event where she meets Guido (Filippo Timi), a former policeman who now works as a security guard. They strike up a friendship, and spend some time together after the event. As they part, Guido notices that the time is 23:23 - a double hour, when the hour and minute are the same. He believes that at such times, one may make a wish and it will be granted - although he admits to Sonia that it doesn't always work. Some days later, Guido takes Sonia to the country villa where he works. The villa has an elaborate security system, but Guido disables part of the system so that the two of them can go for a walk in the grounds. In the woods, they are ambushed by an armed man and Guido is knocked unconscious. Waking up in the villa, he is forced by armed men in balaclavas to disable the security system. The robbers systematically loot the villa of its art treasures and other valuables. As they leave, the leader of the gang menaces Sonia, suggesting he is about to rape her. Enraged, Guido launches himself at him. They struggle, and a shot is fired, but it is not clear what happened next. Sonia is shown back at work, then visiting Guido's grave-site. She is distracted at work, frequently seeing glimpses of Guido's face, sometimes at a double hour. She is questioned by Dante, a policeman and former colleague of Guido, who suspects the robbery at the villa may have been an inside job. Dante gives her a photograph which appears to show her with Guido in Buenos Aires, although she has never been there. Sonia feels her sanity slipping away as her visions of Guido become more frequent and elaborate. Finally she is devastated when she hears that her friend and workmate, Margherita, has committed suicide by jumping out a window. At Margherita's funeral, Sonia is distraught when the officiating priest names the deceased as Sonia instead of Margherita. Bruno, a regular guest at the hotel, takes Sonia away in his car. He gives her a flask which he says contains coffee and a hint of liqueur. Sonia drinks, and is drugged. Bruno drives to a wooded area and drags Sonia out of the car, wrapping her in a plastic sheet and burying her in a shallow grave. Sonia blacks out, and is at the point of death when Guido digs her up and rescues her. Actually, Sonia is recovering from unconsciousness in a hospital. She learns that only three days have elapsed since the robbery, and everything she experienced since was only her imagination, as she lay in coma. She was wounded in the head by that gunshot. And Guido and Margherita are both alive and well. Guido is made aware when Dante tells him that Sonia has a criminal past, when 12 years earlier she helped her boyfriend rob her father's home, but Guido asks they be left in peace. Guido goes to see the speed-dating organizer to tell her he no longer needs her events, but when she tells him that Sonia specifically asked to meet him, Dante's suppositions are confirmed to Guido. He goes to her apartment and has sex with her, but the next morning she tells him she has to go see Margherita. He, knowing she is leaving him as Dante had suggested she would, follows her surreptitiously, and, in the airport garage, sees her meet the robbery gang leader, whom she embraces and kisses, and who bears a resemblance to Guido. He eavesdrops on their conversation with a shotgun microphone, and learns that he was not supposed to have survived the robbery. As the couple get into an elevator, Sonia sees Guido, sitting in his car, who is in the process of calling Dante. Guido looks at Sonia, and she looks at him, unsure. The elevator door closes, and Guido hangs up, not reporting anything to Dante. Nervously, Sonia boards a flight to Buenos Aires using a false identity. She notices that the boarding time is 20:20 - a double hour, and dwells to think for a moment. In the final scenes, Guido is forlorn, and back speed-dating, while Sonia and the gang leader are shown being photographed together in Buenos Aires.

XLVII, May‚ÄìAugust 1805, London: Printed by Straban and Preston (see its title page for year printed as \\"M,DCCC,V\\"). Charles Sanders Peirce came to hold that an explanatory hypothesis is not only justifiable as a tentative conclusion by its plausibility (by which he meant its naturalness and economy of explanation),Peirce, C. S. (1908), \\"A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God\\", Hibbert Journal v. 7, pp. 90‚Äì112. See both part III and part IV. Reprinted, including originally unpublished portion, in Collected Papers v. 6, paragraphs 452‚Äì85, The Essential Peirce v. 2, pp. 434‚Äì50, and elsewhere. but also justifiable as a starting point by the broader promise that the hypothesis holds for research. This idea of justifying a hypothesis as potentially fruitful (at the level of research method), not merely as plausible (at the level of logical conclusions), is essential for the idea of a working hypothesis, as later elaborated by Peirce's fellow pragmatist John Dewey. Peirce held that, as a matter of research method, an explanatory hypothesis is judged and selectedPeirce, C. S., Carnegie Application (L75, 1902, New Elements of Mathematics v. 4, pp. 37‚Äì38.

The Century Dictionary Supplement definition of \\"working hypothesis\\" reflects that perspective; Peirce may or may not have written it.See Peirce Edition Project (UQ√ÄM) ‚Äì in short from the Peirce Edition Project's branch at Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al (UQ√ÄM), which is working on Writings v. 7: Peirce's work on the Century Dictionary. Peirce worked on the Century during the years between 1883 and 1909. Find \\"hypothesis\\" in PEP-UQ√ÄM's list of words in Peirce's charge under \\"H\\". \\"Pragmatism\\" was also in Peirce's charge (see under \\"P\\", but Joseph M. Ransdell reported that PEP-UQ√ÄM's director Fran√ßois Latraverse informed him that John Dewey actually wrote it (see Ransdell's 2006 January 13 post to peirce-l). Peirce seldom used the phrase \\"working hypothesis,\\" but he once commented about a related kind of a hypothesis that it was \\"a hypothesis, which like the working hypothesis of a scientific inquiry, we may not believe to be altogether true, but which is useful in enabling us to conceive of what takes place.\\"Peirce, C. S. Collected Papers v. 7, paragraph 534, from an undated manuscript. For Peirce the pragmatist, conceiving pragmatically of something meant conceiving of its effects in their conceivable implications as to informed practice in general including research.Peirce, C. S. (1878), \\"How to Make Our Ideas Clear\\", Popular Science Monthly, v. 12, 286‚Äì302. Reprinted widely, including The Essential Peirce v. 1, pp. 109‚Äì123. John Dewey used the concept of the working hypothesis as a pivotal feature in his theory of inquiry.Shields, Patricia and Rangarjan, N. 2013. A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating Conceptual Frameworks and Project Management. . Stillwater, OK: New Forums Press. Contrary to the principles of verification and falsifiability, used in formal hypothesis testing found within dominant paradigms of 'normal' science, working hypotheses were conceived by Dewey as neither true nor false but \\"provisional, working means of advancing investigation,\\" which lead to the discovery of other unforeseen but \\"relevant\\" facts. Dewey's development of the concept of the working hypothesis emerged from his contextualist epistemology in which absolute truth is unobtainable and replaced by \\"warranted assertability\\". Thus, Dewey noted: > The history of science also shows that when hypotheses have been taken to be > finally true and hence unquestionable, they have obstructed inquiry and kept > science committed to doctrines that later turned out to be invalid. In Dewey's view, the working hypothesis is generated, not directly as a testable statement of, but instead in order to \\"direct inquiry into channels in which new material, factual and conceptual, is disclosed, material which is more relevant, more weighted and confirmed, more fruitful, than were the initial facts and conceptions which served as the point of departure\\". Abraham Kaplan later described the working hypothesis as \\"provisional or loosely formatted\\" theory or constructs. Design Working hypotheses are constructed to facilitate inquiry; however, formal hypotheses can often be constructed based on the results of the inquiry, which in turn allows for the design of specific experiments whose data will either support or fail to support the formal hypotheses. In Unity of Science as a Working Hypothesis Oppenheim and Putnam argued that unitary science, in which laws from one branch could be equally useful by others, could only be accepted tentatively without further empirical testing. Thus they argued: > We therefore think the assumption that unitary science can be attained > through cumulative micro-reduction recommends itself as a working > hypothesis. That is, we believe that it is in accord with the standards of > reasonable scientific judgment to tentatively accept this hypothesis and to > work on the assumption that further progress can be made in this direction. In \\"The Working Hypothesis in Social Reform\\" George Herbert Mead (1899) takes a macro position and applies the notion of a working hypothesis to social reform.Mead, G.H. (1899) The Working Hypothesis is Social Reform. American Journal of Sociology 5(3) pp. 167‚Äì171. > In the social world we must recognize the working hypothesis as the form > into which all theories must be cast as completely as in the natural > sciences. The highest criterion that we can present is that the hypothesis > shall work in the complex of forces into which we introduce it\\" (p. 369). Mead (1899) also expresses the tentative or provisional nature of working hypotheses. > Given its success (the working hypothesis), he (the social scientist) may > restate his world from this standpoint and get the basis for further > investigation that again always takes the form of a problem. The solution of > this problem is found over again in the possibility of fitting his > hypothetical proposition into the whole within which it arises. And he must > recognize that this statement is only a working hypothesis at the best, > i.e., he knows that further investigation will show that the former > statement of his world is only provisionally true, and must be false from > the standpoint of a larger knowledge, as every partial truth is necessarily > false over against the fuller knowledge which he will gain later (p. 370). For Putnam, the working hypothesis represents a practical starting point in the design of an empirical research exploration. A contrasting example of this conception of the working hypothesis is illustrated by the brain-in-a-vat thought experiment. This experiment involves confronting the global skeptic position that we, in fact, are all just brains in vats being stimulated by a mad scientist to believe that our reality is real. Putnam argued that this proposition, however, rests on a \\"magical theory of reference\\" in which the existential evidence necessary to validate it is assumed. Thus, the brain-in- a-vat proposition does not make for much of a hypothesis at all since there is no means to verify its truth. It does, however, provide a contrast for what a good working hypothesis would look like: one suited to culling potential existential evidence of the subject at hand. A more concrete example would be that of conjectures in mathematics ‚Äì propositions which appear to be true but which are formally unproven. Very often, conjectures will be provisionally accepted as working hypotheses in order to investigate its consequences and formulate conditional proofs. Materials scientists Hosono et al. (1996) developed a working hypothesis about the nature of optically transparent and electrically conducting amorphous oxides.Hosono, H., Kikuchi, N., Ueda, N. and Kqwazoe, H. (1996) Working hypothesis to explore novel wide band gap electrically conducting amorphous oxides and examples, Journal of Non- Crystalline Solids 198‚Äì200 pp. 165‚Äì169 This exploratory study evaluated the hypothesis's effectiveness using confirming examples (p. 169).

Research projects that use working hypotheses use a deductive reasoning or logic of inquiry. In other words, the problem and preliminary theory are developed ahead of time and tested using evidence. Working hypotheses (statements of expectation) are flexible and incorporate relational or non- relational statements. They are often used as ways to investigate a problem in a particular city or public agency.Swift, James T. 2010. \\"Exploring Capital Metro's Sexual Harassment Training Using Dr. Bengt-Ake Lundvall's Taxonomy of Knowledge Principles\\".

Case Study Research: Design and Methods. 4th edition. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage The working hypotheses are used as a device to direct evidence collection. As a result, working hypotheses are generally organized using sub- hypotheses, which specify in more detail the kinds of data or evidence needed to support the hypothesis.

Antony Simon (Mammootty) is a crime branch CI, but prefers to spend his time fooling around with his son Aadi (Dhananjay). And being a Crime Branch police officer, his rather laid-back attitude is not appreciated by his peers and superiors. Richa Pallod portrays his wife who finds this irritating. The father-son duo becomes friends with the famous national cricketer Sreekanth (Govind Padmasurya) when they save him from some street fight. Once while the father-son duo was out for shopping, Aadi saw a man with the gun and screams at his father. Simon turns back and shoots him but he kills the wrong person. Simon now faces murder charges and is suspended from duty. Later that day, Aadhi is found missing. Simon being a cop, the entire police force in the district is in search. They find that the one who was killed by Simon was the younger brother of the leader of a gang who were trying to get Sreekanth into a match-fixing deal and now they are trying to get revenge on Simon for killing one of their gang members. They have abducted Aadi. The rest of the film is how Simon fights the gang and gets his kid back from them with brave ways.

In 1964, Banco Federal Ita√∫ S.A. merged Banco Federal de Cr√©dito and Banco Ita√∫, a rural bank belonging to a group originated in Ita√∫ de Minas, in Minas Gerais countryside. Later that decade, Banco Ita√∫ acquired Banco Sul Americano (1966) and Banco da Am√©rica (1969). In 2020, due to improper charges between 2008 and 2018, Ita√∫ signed an agreement with the Central Bank of Brazil committing itself to returning 75.6 million Reais to its customers. In the 1970s, it merged with Banco Alian√ßa in Rio de Janeiro (1973), Banco Portugu√™s do Brasil (1974), and Banco Uni√£o Comercial (1974). In 1979, it opened its first operations abroad with a representative office in New York City and a subsidiary in Buenos Aires. In the 1980s, it acquired only one small bank, Banco Pinto de Magalh√£es (1985). Still, this enabled it to continue growing while other Brazilian banks were getting smaller. In 1984, it converted its representative office in New York to a branch. In the 1990s, it acquired BFB (Banco Franc√™s e Brasileiro) (1995) from Credit Lyonnais, and also several privatized former state banks: *1997: Banerj (Rio de Janeiro) *1998: BEMGE (Minas Gerais) *2000: Banestado (Paran√°) *2001: BEG (Goi√°s) During the 1990s, Banco Ita√∫ invested heavily in automation, including ATMs and machines installed on customers' premises. At the same time, it cut its staff by more than 50%. In 1994, it expanded its international operations by founding Banco Ita√∫ Europa, Banco Ita√∫ Argentina, and Ita√∫ Bank (Cayman). In 1997, it acquired Bamerindus Luxembourg, which is now Banco Ita√∫ Europa Luxembourg. When it acquired Banco del Buen Ayre in Argentina in 1998, it subsequently incorporated it into Banco Ita√∫ Argentina, now known as Banco Ita√∫ Buen Ayre. Banco Ita√∫ has also established a number of alliances. In 1996, it and Bankers Trust, New York, created Ita√∫ Bankers Trust Banco de Investimento, the present Itauvest Banco de Investimento. Banco Ita√∫ also has an important stake in Banco BPI, one of Portugal's largest banks. In 2002, Banco Ita√∫ joined with Banco BBA-Creditanstalt S.A. (BBA) to create, in 2003, Banco Ita√∫-BBA, the largest wholesale bank in Brazil. In the 2000s (decade), it continued to acquire banks. In 2002, it acquired Banco Fiat, together with all of Fiat's auto financing activities. In 2004, it opened a branch in Tokyo. Then, in April 2006, Banco Ita√∫ purchased the Brazilian operations of BankBoston, a subsidiary that Bank of America acquired with its purchase of FleetBoston. This increased Banco Ita√∫'s clients by 300,000 and assets by R$22 billion. In return, Bank of America took about a 6% stake in Banco Ita√∫. BankBoston do Brazil had been founded in 1947. With the purchase, the BankBoston name disappeared from Brazil as Bank of America retained the rights to the name. Banco Ita√∫ also received exclusive rights to purchase BankBoston's operations in Chile and Uruguay. In late 2006, it exercised these rights, and in late 2006 and early 2007, it received the necessary regulatory approvals. These two operations became Banco Ita√∫ Chile and Banco Ita√∫ Uruguay. On November 2, 2008, Banco Ita√∫ and the third largest Brazilian private banking group, Unibanco, announced their intention to merge. In late February 2009, the Central Bank of Brazil approved the merger.  References  External links  * Banco Ita√∫ Holding Financeira S.A.

Its first director was the economist Sonal Shah. The final director was David Wilkinson. History In 2009, President Barack Obama created the White House Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation (SICP) as part of his Domestic Policy Council within the Executive Office of the President, the office that coordinates White House domestic policy. The idea for a White House Office for Social Entrepreneurship was first developed at the Center for American Progress by then-Senior Fellow and former Ashoka staffer Michele Jolin. In the past, public monies have often been directed to social initiatives that are failing or that have only a limited impact. At the same time, non-profit organizations, even if readily able to obtain short-term startup financing, face difficulty securing capital to sustain and expand successful programs. Building on ideas of past administrations, the Obama- Biden transition plans included the creation of an agency within the Corporation for National and Community Service dedicated to building the capacity and effectiveness of the nonprofit sector. The plans highlighted the potential of this sector - as of 2012, nonprofits generated $1.5 trillion within the US economy, employed 13.5 million Americans and contributed nearly 5.5% GDP, while struggling with a scarcity of resources, given the uncertainty of donations, and their lack of access to traditional incentives to growth enjoyed by for-profit businesses. (By statute, 501(c)(3) organizations are not eligible for Small Business Authority loans, nor can they obtain many commercial debt products designed for small and medium enterprises.) The transition plans also called for using federal seed money to leverage private sector funding, so as to improve local innovation, expand successful programs, and test the impact of new ideas. Also significant as a background to the creation of the SCIP were the recent changes in the social sector, with the emergence of scalable, market-based models of social change as a driving force. Such models include social enterprises with earned income strategies; mission-driven businesses that focus on achieving a double-bottom line; impact investors that seek to earn a financial return while achieving social benefit; and multinational companies pursuing models of corporate responsibility. No administration had focused on these trends until the Obama Administration created the Office of Social Innovation to build a policy agenda in this realm. Definition The term Social Innovation, as defined by Stanford Social Innovation Review (SSIR), refers to a methodology of solving societal problems through new mechanisms that harness human and financial capital, and often stand at the crossroads of non-profit, public, and private sectors. Specifically, SSIR frames social innovation as \\"a novel solution to a social problem that is more effective, efficient, sustainable, or just than existing solutions and for which the value created accrues primarily to society as a whole rather than private individuals\\". Social innovation refers to invention and new problem solving methods not only in non-profits, but also more broadly in how social entrepreneurs seek to address human development challenges, how impact investors think about providing capital to organizations who maximize stakeholder value, and how mission-driven businesses and socially responsible corporations lever their comparative advantages to improve societal outcomes. Mission The mission of the Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation is to strengthen and support the social sector. This includes nonprofit organizations, foundations, and social entrepreneurs, non- governmental organizations, mission-driven business, and multinational developmental banks. Strategy The White House Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation seeks to facilitate social innovation by harnessing human capital and facilitating the flow of financial capital. Based on evidence that communities with higher degrees of civic health exhibit better economic resilience, lower jobless rates, and faster returns to the workforce, the Administration believes that a strong social sector leads to better economic opportunity. Tactically, the Office of Social Innovation seeks to unlock social innovation potential on two fronts: Unlocking human capital and unlocking financial capital. Policies and programs=Priorities within harnessing human capital= The Office of Social Innovation drives federal policy regarding national service and volunteering. This is based on research that indicates that communities with higher degrees of civic health have increased economic resilience and lower rates of unemployment. Such civic health can be measured by indicators such as the rates of volunteering, voting, and the density of per capita nonprofits that provide essential local services. It is consistent with scholarship that has shown that unemployed people who volunteer have a higher likelihood of finding work than those who do not volunteer. The data also indicates that interest in volunteering has reached extraordinary levels with historic numbers of applications for public programs such as AmeriCorps and Peace Corps. The popularity of non- governmental service programs such as Code for America, DataKind, and Global Citizen Year also has grown in recent years. All seem to indicate that more Americans want to serve ‚Äì and that such talent could be put to good use to contribute to national renewal and stronger communities. National service National service has been a part of the fabric of American society since the founding of the country. It encompasses various models of public service including military service, and civilian service, such as AmeriCorps. Typically it is characterized by dedicated service to a single year or multi- year commitment at a single nonprofit organization. Participants benefit from a stipend of some sort that is important due to the fact that national service can be a part-time or full-time commitment, but the nature of the commitment precludes the participant from other full-time work. Serve America Act In April 2009, President Barack Obama signed the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act reauthorizing and expanding national service programs. The law added the number of AmeriCorps positions from 75,000 to 250,000 and created four new service corps. It was the most significant piece of national service legislation since the 1993 The National and Community Service Trust Act signed into law by President Bill Clinton. After laying out a plan for expanding AmeriCorps, the Administration launched FEMA Corps, a new service corps that builds upon the long-standing partnership between NCCC and Federal Emergency Management Agency through the creation of 1600 new AmeriCorps positions focused on disaster preparedness and relief activities. Enabled by new federal funding, these incremental corps members will gain hands-on experience and new skills that will improve their own professional prospects for the rest of their lives while they are increasing national resilience. Since the announcement, FEMA Corps members have been on the ground, helping with the coordinated response to disasters such as Superstorm Sandy in New York and New Jersey and the tornadoes in Oklahoma. Presidential Memorandum on National Service In July 2013, President Obama announced a Presidential Memorandum on expanding national service. The memorandum supports new partnerships between federal agencies and Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) to expand national service opportunities for Americans. The memorandum, which created a Task Force consisting of members of Cabinet, focused on expanding national service. Agencies are required to create a plan to utilize national service and volunteering. The Task Force is chaired by the CEO of CNCS and the Director of the Domestic Policy Council. =Volunteering=Day of Service In 1994, Congress designated Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday as a national day of service ] and in 2009 designated September 11 as a national day of service. Both designations are affiliated with President Obama's United We Serve campaign, a nationwide service call. =Community partnerships=White House Council on Community Solutions In 2010, President Obama signed the executive order establishing White House Council for Community Solutions to engage cross sector leaders to identify initiatives that expanded civic participation, helped solve the nation's most serious problems and create new pathways for \\"Disconnected Youth\\", 16- to 24-year-olds who are out of school and work. First Lady Michelle Obama served as honorary chair of the Council. The Council was chaired on a daily basis by former Gates Foundation CEO Patty Stonesifer. Its membership included a cross-section of business, nonprofit and community leaders including rock musician Jon Bon Jovi, Starbucks executive Paula Boggs, and eBay CEO John Donahue. The Council participated in a series of town hall meetings across the country and conducted considerable research to understand the issues facing this population. The Council delivered its Final Report and Recommendations to the President in June 2012. One of its recommendations was to reposition the conversation about \\"Disconnected Youth\\" to \\"Opportunity Youth\\" in order to more appropriate consider these young people as valuable assets who could contribute to economic growth and civic renewal. The Council also generated additional output, including the creation of toolkit for employers seeking to hire Opportunity Youth. It spawned other outcomes, including the launch of the Aspen Forum for Community Solutions headed up by former White House Domestic Policy Advisor Melody Barnes. Summer Jobs + and Youth Jobs + The Administration launched the Summer Jobs + initiative, which provided paid employment opportunities to low-income and disconnected youth and pathways to employment through resume writing workshops, mentorship programs and job shadow days. Through the initiative, over 300,000 employment opportunities were provided to youth in 2012, over 100,000 of which were paid. In April 2013, the President launched the Youth Jobs + initiative. He challenged business, non-profits and government to work together to provide employment opportunities for low-income and disconnected youth that will also aim to reduce youth violence in local communities. In September, the White House hosted a convening that focused on youth employment, especially \\"opportunity youth\\", people between 18‚Äì24 years of age. The event recognized and honored employers and nonprofits for innovative work to develop the discipline and skills associated with the employment for the country's youth. =Priorities within harnessing financial capital= Based on the research, it is clear that the social sector lacks adequate capital to address the needs of Americans and maintain its role as a safety net and economic engine. To reverse this trend, the Office of Social Innovation has laid out a strategy to optimize the flow of scarce public dollars and to increase the flow of incremental private dollars. This dual track is enabled by a five-part framework: #Better Information #New Instruments #Strong Intermediaries #Institutional Capital #Impact at Scale Harnessing better information, taking into account transparencies provided by technology, data and evidence can support what programs are working, and which are in need of iteration or reform. Better information can lead to evidence that a program is working, and can help the government better allocate grants to support successful programs. Consequently, the government can have a higher probability of \\"investing in what works,\\" better optimize public spend, and serve as a more responsible fiduciary for taxpayers. New instruments can help government alloy public dollars with private dollars, leverage outside expertise for localization or diligence, and attract outside capital to address social problems. Through the use of strong intermediaries, public-private partnerships can tap local knowledge, and build a sustainable ecosystem that goes beyond government. Better information, new instruments and strong intermediaries that help build sustainable ecosystems to solve hard problems can attract and unlock institutional capital, and as a consequence, programs can achieve true impact at scale. Information=Impact Data Initiative= The Office of Social Innovation created the Impact Data Initiative to create more transparency regarding information related to the social sector as a strategy to increase the flow of financial capital into the field. The Impact Data Initiative has been focused on opening federal databases as well as encouraging nonprofits to provide additional information. It has been supported by nonprofit organizations such as the Aspen Institute, Charity Navigator, Guidestar, and the Urban Institute. The Impact Data Initiative has predicated on changes to the Form 990. This is an annual reporting return that certain federally tax-exempt organizations must file with the Internal Revenue Service. In 2008, the form was revised as a result of the passage of the Federal Pension Protection Act.http://www.councilofnonprofits.org/resources/resources-topic/boards- governance/irs-form-990-governance-guidance All 501 (c) 3 private foundations regardless of income must file a Form 990. The form provides information on the organization's mission, programs and finances. The public is guaranteed access to this information, but the IRS has not published this information in a manner consistent with trends in open data: it not very accessible nor available in a machine-readable format. President Obama has proposed to phase in a requirement that all nonprofit organizations file their annual tax returns electronically in order to facilitate improved access to this information in a manner consistent with the Open Government Initiative. In November 2013, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus released a tax reform discussion draft with a proposal to mandate all tax-exempt organizations required to file a Form 990 electronically and requiring the IRS to make the information on the forms available to the public in a machine readable format as soon as practicable.http://independentsector.org/efiling_form_990#sthash.YjzlbkvC.dpbs =Evidence based policy= As part of President Obama's management agenda, the Office of Social Innovation has helped to lead federal agencies to increasingly focus on the use of data and modeling to inform and improve what is called evidence based policy. Evidence Based Policy is not new, but it is an important priority of the Administration, as outlined explicitly in a Memorandum M-13-17 issued in July 2013 by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and signed by directors of the White House OMB, Domestic Policy Council (DPC), Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), and Council of Economic Advisors (CEA). The memorandum provides guidance for fiscal year 2015 agency budget submissions, and describes plans to prioritize budget requests that strengthen the use of evidence and innovation to inform and improve decision- making. The memorandum gave explicit guidance in a number of key issues, such as: #Harnessing data to improve agency results #High-quality, low-cost evaluations for rapid, iterative experimentation #Using innovative outcome- focused grant designs #Strengthening agency capacity to use evidence And OMB, in partnership with DPC, CEA, and OSTP orchestrated workshops designed to help federal agencies interpret and apply the budget guidance, taking into account how to focus evaluation resources on the most important policy questions, how to use \\"administrative data sets\\" from multiple programs and agencies, how to conduct rigorous program evaluations and data analytics on a tight budget, how to use existing budgetary authority to turn traditional competitive grant programs into innovative, evidence-based programs, and how agencies could harness research findings from behavioral science to implement low-cost approaches to improving program efficacy. While the Administration's focus on evidence-based policy is notable, it is not entirely unique. In 2013, Elaine Kamarck at Brookings launched the Center for Effective Public Management, the World Bank Institute promotes what it calls, \\"Lean\\" in the Public Sector, building upon the concepts of \\"Lean Startup\\" and \\"Lean Analytics\\" from Silicon Valley, the other agencies such as USAID, Education, and Labor already have competitive grant programs such as Development Innovation Ventures that take into account staged or tiered venture capital style grant making, using evidence to support scale-up grants. Programs that utilize better information to inform decision-making in grants that involve strong intermediaries and that enable greater scale and innovation by driving new private capital into the social sector are often labeled \\"Innovation Funds,\\" a priority that enables human and financial capital. This work is highlighted in an April 2014 SSIR article. Instruments=Social Innovation Fund= The Social Innovation Fund (SIF) founded in 2009 and administered by the Corporation for National and Community Service, is one of the flagship social innovation programs created by the Obama Administration. Designed by the Office of Social Innovation, the SIF is a public-private partnership that tests promising new approaches to major challenges, leverages private and philanthropic capital to meet these needs, and grows evidence-based programs that demonstrate measurable outcomes. SIF's unique model leverages private and local resources by investing millions of dollars in experienced grant makers or \\"intermediaries\\" that are well-positioned within communities to identify the most capable programs and guide them towards greater impact and strong evidence of success.http://www.nationalservice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/factsheet_sif.pdf Such intermediaries then must raise incremental funds 3:1 in order to amplify the power of the federal funds. These organizations ‚Äì which include venture philanthropies, community development financial institutions (CDFIs), operating foundations and social enterprises ‚Äì then invest the aggregate capital into high-impact nonprofits that are delivering evidence-based results in one of three priority issue areas: economic opportunity, healthy futures, and youth development. In its first three years, SIF has awarded $137 million to 20 intermediary grant-makers, which have selected 221 nonprofit sub- grantees working in 37 states and the District of Columbia. Some notable SIF investments include College Advising Corps; Chrysalis; Harlem Children's Zone; and YearUp. In 2014, the Federal Budget increased SIF, raising the program from $45 million to $70 million which many interpreted as a strong validation of the Administration's social innovation agenda. The SIF originally was headed up by former Bridgespan executive Paul Carttar. Its current director is Michael Smith, a former senior executive of the Case Foundation. During his tenure at Case, Smith was credited with helping to lead A Billion+ Change and the Startup America Partnership. =Pay For Success= Pay for Success (PFS) is a signature strategy of social innovations. It was originally pioneered by the Ford Administration as \\"social impact bonds.\\"Social impact bond PFS offers innovative ways for the government to build public-private partnerships can be bring capital to test promising practices and scale programs that work, significantly enhancing the return on taxpayer investments because government only pays for programs that achieve results. At the same time, PFS offers the prospect of attracting new investment capital to fund important social programs, thus potentially boosting the capital available to fund social programs while creating new return horizons for private investors. The Office of Social Innovation prioritized PFS in 2011 by introduce PFS in the FY12 Budget and initiating a series of events designed to educate local, county and state lawmakers about the opportunity presented by PFS. Since that time, the White House has hosted numerous workshops, panel discussions, and other events focused on PFS. The Administration also has prioritized grant programs to pilot the potential of PFS to tackle various challenges. The Department of Justice announced three awards in September 2012: an implementation award in Cuyahoga County, Ohio and a planning award in Lowell, Massachusetts under the Second Chance Act and an additional contract to develop a blueprint for governments to use Pay for Success to reduce recidivism. The Department of Labor announced two awards totaling $24 million in September 2013: one to the New York Department of Labor in the amount of $12,000,000 and the other to the Massachusetts Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development in the amount of $11,670,000. These grants will support programming that aims to increase employment and reduce recidivism among formerly incarcerated individuals. One of the key proposals SICP made for FY 2014 was a new $300 million Pay for Success Incentive Fund at the Department of Treasury. The Fund is designed to help State and local governments implement Pay for Success programs with financial partners. It will provide credit enhancements for organizations that seek to introduce Pay for Success and offer direct grants to fund outcome payments for successful, money-saving services. =Program Related Investments= The regulations regarding Program Related Investments (PRIs) originally were drafted in 1972 as part of a broad effort on tax reform. These rules facilitate the ability of foundations to move beyond conventional grants and use other financial means to support nonprofits or businesses pursuing charitable purposes. However, PRIs have not been adopted widely by the nonprofit field because their complexity in part due to the outdated regulations created higher transactions costs for foundations who wanted to use them.http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/news-articles/foundations-not-making- many-program-related-investments/ In 2012, the Treasury Department updated aspects of the regulations for the first time in 40 years since they were first drafted. By publishing a set of clarifying examples of how PRIs could be used, the Obama Administration tried to make it easier for foundations to see how they can adopt flexible approaches to the deployment of capital. The examples included scenarios including the use of credit enhancements, loan guarantees, lines of credit, even equity investments to achieve their philanthropic missions. Impact Investing The Office of Social Innovation has been responsible for elevating impact investing inside the Federal government. It has defined impact investing as \\"the practice of channeling capital toward businesses that intentionally generate economic return and public benefit\\". Such businesses openly track and measure social, environmental, and governance (ESG) considerations alongside their financial returns. The Office of Social Innovation has hosted large-scale meetings, including the White House Forum on Impact Economy executed in partnership with the Aspen Institute. It launched the National Impact Initiative, a new approach to coordinate federal policy on impact investing. This encompasses the work of multiple federal agencies focused on impact investing, including programs such as the SBIC Impact Fund launched by SBA; the Freshworks Fund created by the Treasury Department and US Department of Agriculture; the Accelerating Market Partnerships program of the US State Department; and the Global Development Innovation Ventures partnership managed by USAID. The Office has coordinated the US Government's participation in the US's G8 Social Impact Investing Forum and the subsequent work of the Social Impact Investment Task Force chaired Ronald Cohen. The US representatives on the Task Force include Matt Bannick, CEO of the Omidyar Network and the Honorable Don Graves, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Treasury.http://www.omidyar.com/about_us/news/2013/09/03/white-house-names- omidyar-network-managing-partner-matt-bannick-social-impa The US Advisory Board to the Task Force includes a wide range of thought leaders and impact investors.http://www.omidyar.com/about_us/news/2013/10/02/global-social- impact-investment-task-force-appoints-members-us-national-adv Personnel= Staff = Special Assistant to the President and Director of SICP: Jonathan Greenblatt is Special Assistant to the President and Director of the Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation.

RCC telescope at Rozhen Observatory, the largest optical telescope on the Balkans Overview  Spending on research and development is low, amounting to 0.78% of GDP, and the bulk of public R&D; funding goes to the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (BAS). Private businesses accounted for more than 73% of R&D; expenditures and employed 42% of Bulgaria's 22,000 researchers in 2015. The same year, Bulgaria ranked 39th out of 50 countries in the Bloomberg Innovation Index, the highest score being in education (24th) and the lowest in value-added manufacturing (48th). By 2020, Bulgaria ranked 42nd, but with an increase in value-added manufacturing to 33rd. Chronic government underinvestment in research since 1990 has forced many professionals in science and engineering to leave Bulgaria. Despite the lack of funding, research in chemistry, materials science and physics remains strong. High levels of female participation in science and engineering, a legacy of the Socialist era, are characteristic for all fields of research. Fields of research=ICT= Three per cent of economic output is generated by the information and communication technologies (ICT) sector where 40,000 to 51,000 software engineers are employed. More than a quarter of Bulgarian ICT specialists are women, the highest percentage of females in ICT in any EU country. Computer science builds upon foundations laid in the Socialist era, when the country was known as a \\"Communist Silicon Valley\\" due to its key role in COMECON computing technology production. Pravetz computers were the principal mass computer series designed and manufactured in Bulgaria at the time. Bulgaria is also a regional leader in high performance computing. The Institute of Computer and Communication Systems at BAS operates Avitohol, the most powerful supercomputer in Southeast Europe. Four smaller supercomputing clusters that do not represent true supercomputers operate in Sofia: an unnamed machine at BAS, PHYSON at Sofia University's Faculty of Physics, Madara at the Institute of Organic Chemistry at BAS, and Nestum at Sofia Tech Park. An IBM Blue Gene/P at the National Centre for Supercomputing Applications ceased operations in 2015. =Physics= Ivan Stranski (1897‚Äì1979) developed the molecular-kinetic theory of crystal formation and crystal growth. The results of his work on crystal structure and behaviour have had wide application in the areas of physical chemistry, metallurgy and mining. Georgi Nadjakov was among Bulgaria's top physicists, and became known for his experiments on the photoelectric effect and most notably, the discovery of photoelectrets. Nadjakov's discoveries are now widely employed in photocopier machines. Bulgaria is an active member of CERN and has contributed to its activities with nearly 200 scientists since its accession in 1999. Bulgarian scientists took part in the L3 experiment of the Large Electron‚ÄìPositron Collider in the 1980s. =Medicine= A domestic pharmaceutical industry grew quickly after a Soviet-style planned economy was implemented in the late 1940s. Cytisine, a smoking cessation aid, and galantamine, a drug synthesised by Dimitar Paskov and used to treat cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease, are some of the drugs developed by Bulgarian researchers. Generic drugs form the backbone of the industry, although innovative drugs make up 75% of the market in terms of value. There is a well-developed drug research base in hospitals along with highly qualified researchers and drug manufacturing by EU standards, but poor funding and limited experience in early stage clinical trials are a weakness. Sopharma AD has been a leader in pharmaceutical research since the 1950s. Dr. Georgi Stranski University Hospital in Pleven was the first hospital to implement the Da Vinci Surgical System in the country and operates two systems. Two other hospitals in Sofia, Acibadem City Clinic Tokuda Hospital and Doverie, each operate one Da Vinci system. =Nuclear energy= Bulgaria began studying nuclear energy for power generation as early as 1956. An agreement with the Soviet Union to begin construction of industrial-scale nuclear reactors was reached ten years later, in 1966. Today, more than a third (34.8%) of electricity in the national grid is produced by nuclear reactors at the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant. Commercial power generation from its two VVER-1000 units is supported by a diverse research, education and engineering capacity spread among several institutions. Sofia University and the Technical University of Sofia train engineers at the Nuclear Engineering and Thermal and Nuclear Power departments, respectively. The Institute for Nuclear Research and Nuclear Energy (INRNE) of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences is mostly focused on research and development. It is currently building the largest particle accelerator in Southeast Europe, a cyclotron that is expected to produce up to 25,000 doses for radiotherapy once completed. Equipment was delivered in 2016, but a new building for the center is yet to be constructed. INRNE also owns an IRT-2000 research reactor that achieved first criticality in 1961, but has been shut down in 1999 and awaiting reconstruction since then. Until 1992, when the government of Filip Dimitrov ordered an end to uranium mining, Bulgaria was extracting 645 tonnes of uranium annually, and produced yellowcake. The material was shipped to the USSR for processing, and then returned to Bulgaria as fuel for the Kozloduy power plant. =Space exploration= The Sokol space suit used by cosmonaut Aleksandar Aleksandrov Bulgaria has made numerous contributions to space exploration. These include two scientific satellites, Bulgaria 1300 and Bulgaria 1300-II, more than 200 payloads and 300 experiments in Earth orbit, as well as two cosmonauts since 1971. Bulgaria was the first country to grow wheat and vegetables in space with its Svet greenhouses on the Mir space station. It was involved in the development of the Granat gamma-ray observatory and the Vega program, particularly in modelling trajectories and guidance algorithms for both Vega probes. The supercomputer developed by IZOT for the mission was later used by the Soviet Union for nuclear fusion simulations. Bulgarian instruments have been used in the exploration of Mars, including the VSK spectrometer that took the first high quality spectroscopic images of Martian moon Phobos with the Phobos 2 probe. Cosmic radiation en route to and around the planet has been mapped by Liulin-ML dosimeters on the ExoMars TGO. RADOM-7, an instrument of the Liulin class, has been fitted to the Chandrayaan-1 lunar probe, while other versions of the Liulin operate on the International Space Station. Bulgaria's first geostationary communications satellite‚ÄîBulgariaSat-1‚Äîwas launched by SpaceX in June 2017. Endurosat One became the first Bulgarian CubeSat to be inserted into orbit in July 2018. The Rozhen Observatory, the largest in Southeastern Europe, the Belogradchik Observatory and the Shumen University Observatory are Bulgaria's main astronomical observatories. Several smaller \\"public observatories\\" with planetaria, focused on educational and outreach activities, are located in various towns across the country. Astronomer Georgi Mandushev headed the team of scientists, which discovered TrES-4b. =Aviation= Sofia Airport hosts one of Lufthansa Technik's 12 aircraft maintenance and repair facilities in Europe. A significant expansion worth $42 million was completed in 2017, expanding staff to 1,300 engineers and mechanics, adding a new multi-purpose building, hangar and workshops, and increasing capacity to eight production and servicing lines. The facility services mostly Airbus A320, Boeing 737 and Embraer-series aircraft. A few companies like Niki Rotor Aviation and Aeroplanes DAR form a small manufacturing industry, producing ultralight aircraft in limited numbers. Asen Yordanov (1896‚Äì1967), the founder of aeronautical engineering in Bulgaria, worked as an aviator, engineer and inventor; he also contributed to the development of aviation in the United States. He played a significant role in U.S. aircraft development (mostly bomber and carrier-based aircraft) and took part in many other projects. Yordanov created the first Bulgarian airplane, the \\"Diplan Yordanov-1\\", in 1915. Captain Simeon Petrov of the Bulgarian Air Force invented the world's first purpose-built air-to-surface bomb, which included innovations such as an aerodynamically stabilizing x-tail and an impact detonator. To this day the majority of aircraft bombs in the world follow Petrov's 1912 design. The Bulgarian Air Force deployed the original prototype, thus becoming the first military force in the world to conduct tactical airplane bombing sorties during a full-scale war (in 1912). =Antarctic exploration= Since the 1980s, Bulgaria maintains an active exploration program of the Antarctic region. Following an unsuccessful landing attempt at Cape Vostok on the northwestern extremity of Alexander Island, two prefabricated huts were assembled on Livingston Island between 26 and 29 April 1988 by a four-member Bulgarian party supported logistically by the Soviet Research Ship Mikhail Somov. The facilities were later refurbished and inaugurated as a permanent base on 11 December 1993. An expansion programme at St. Kliment Ohridski including the construction of a new multi-purpose building was carried out between 1996 and 1998 and subsequently. Some of the expeditions resulted in the publishing in 2009 of a comprehensive topographic map, including Greenwich, Snow, Robert and Smith islands.

Worked from the early 18th century until 1945, first for copper and later tin, it was very profitable for much of its life. Today the site has two preserved beam engines and is part of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape World Heritage Site. It is owned by the National Trust. Geology The country rock at the mine is metamorphosed killas and greenstone overlying the Carn Brea granite. The many lodes on the sett are all crossed by several elvan dykes. The mine's main produce was copper and later tin, arsenic and wolframite,Dines 1956, p.326 also small amounts of the ores of bismuth, cobalt and uranium.Burt et al. 1987, pp.383‚Äì389 History to 1900 East Pool mine started out in the early 18th century as a copper mine called \\"Pool Old Bal\\". The land under which it was allowed to mine (the \\"sett\\") was leased from the Basset family and it generated enough money for that family to build their country house at Tehidy. The mine's adit was below ground and mining had taken place below this, the workings being drained by a flatrod system powered by a water wheel south of Pool village.Morrison 1980, p.142 This phase of mining ceased in 1784. The mine restarted as East Pool mine in 1834. Its small sett (about 900 by 400 yards)Morrison 1980, p.142 (map) was bounded on the west by South Crofty and Tincroft mines, and on the south by the Carn Brea mines. On its north was Wheal Agar, with which it was later to merge. The mine had a very productive and long life, raising of copper ore and, later, of tin ore. In its early days the copper ore here was particularly rich, selling in 1835 for over ¬£12 a long ton which was more than twice the average price at the time. This first profitable period lasted for ten years during which time a total of ¬£32,256 dividends were paid on the 128 shares that had cost their owners a mere ¬£5 each.Morrison 1980, p.143 By 1843 the mine was employing 300 people and its deepest workings were at . However, a slump in the later 1840s almost caused the closure of the mine and its workings became partly flooded, which jeopardised the neighbouring South Crofty mine. This caused Lady Basset to threaten to revoke the sett unless the mine was fully worked. The mine struggled on‚Äîone regular source of income was the monthly drainage charges totalling ¬£60 that were paid by the neighbouring mines, including Wheal Agar‚Äîbut it was not profitable again until 1854.Morrison 1980, p.143‚Äì145 In 1860 a rich body of ore containing wolframite was discovered. This ore has a similar specific gravity to cassiterite and the normal methods used for separating the ore from gangue could not separate these two minerals. To solve this problem a Wetherill's Magnetic Separator, which could process 10 tons of ore per day, was installed.Earl 1994, p.96‚Äì97 East Pool was one of the few mines, along with South Crofty, Tincroft, Dolcoath and Wheal Basset and a few others, that were able to survive the depression of the Cornish mining industry in the late 19th century. All these mines were close to one another and pumping water from the workings was still of highest priority: if any of the pumping engines stopped there were serious repercussions at the other mines. Such was the problem of underground water that their winding (whim) engines were adapted to haul water by using self- tipping water-skips‚Äîthis was done at East Pool in 1897.Barton 1966, p.78 East Pool mine still had a problem with water coming from Wheal Agar, which was losing money at the time and kept threatening to switch off its pumps, which it did in late 1895. The productive lower levels of East Pool flooded, meaning that it was restricted to reworking its older higher levels. Negotiations between the two mines continued for over a year until, after the intervention of Lord Robartes, who owned the Wheal Agar land, East Pool purchased Wheal Agar and all its equipment for ¬£4,000, taking possession on 10 March 1897.Morrison 1980, pp.158‚Äì159 After 1900 A train hauled by a Camborne & Redruth tram locomotive Despite its problems, in almost every year from 1884 to 1913 more than 500 people were employed at the mine, with roughly half employed above ground and half underground. In 1913 the mine converted from a company that was run on the cost-book principle to a limited company called East Pool and Agar Ltd. Since the 1860s, the mine had had an extensive ore processing plant located just over a mile to the east in the Red River valley at Tolvaddon,Morrison 1980, p.145‚Äì146 and from 1903 until August 1934 ore was transported there via a mineral tramway which used part of the track of the Camborne and Redruth Tramways, going through Pool village.Trounson & Bullen 1999, pp.102‚Äì103 After the tramway closed in 1934 the ore was carried by an aerial ropeway which ran directly across the countryside to the mill. This was a successful system that continued in use until the closure of the mine in 1945.Trounson & Bullen 1999, pp.113‚Äì115 In 1921 there was a large rockfall underground which destroyed both of the mine's winding shafts,Trounson & Bullen 1999, p.105 and caused flooding, so the next year a new shaft, named Taylor's Shaft after the mine manager, was started. In 1924 a notable pumping engine was installed at this shaft, having been moved from Carn Brea mine where it had lain unused since 1914. It was known as Harvey's Engine and had been designed by Nicholas Trestrail and built in 1892 by Harvey & Co. It pumped water from the mine using seven lifts of pumps of diameter.Barton 1966, pp.242‚Äì243 The chimney stack for this engine's boilers was completed before the engine house was built. The unique feature of this stack, the vertical letters \\"EPAL\\" displayed in white bricks near the top, is still visible. As well as standing for \\"East Pool and Agar Limited\\", \\"EPAL\\" was also the brand name of the arsenic sold by the company. The mine was taken over by its neighbour, South Crofty, and closed in 1945, but Harvey's Engine continued to pump water out of the South Crofty workings until 28 September 1954, when it was replaced by electrical pumps. It is likely that the Harvey's engine would have been scrapped were it not for the intervention of a Mr Greville Bathe of Florida, who purchased the engine and donated it to the Cornish Engines Preservation Committee, who gave it to the National Trust in 1967. Today Today, the site is within area A5 (The Camborne & Redruth Mining District) of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape World Heritage Site, and two beam engines have been preserved here. Michell's Shaft Engine House () contains the last beam whim engine to be installed in Cornwall. It has a cylinder of diameter and was built in 1887 by Holman Brothers.Hancock 2008, pp.89‚Äì91 It cost ¬£675 and was designed to run at 27 strokes per minute and have a winding speed of .Barton 1966, p.205 The engine was saved from being scrapped in 1941; it has been in the care of the National Trust since 1967 and since 1975 is still run on occasions. At Taylor's Shaft the National Trust has an Industrial Discovery Centre which incorporates several buildings dating from the 1920s. One of these is the engine house still containing the Harvey's Engine, which was saved through a donation from an American benefactor.Barton 1966, p.243 File:East Pool Mine Taylor's Shaft boilers.jpgTaylor's shaft boilers File:East Pool Mine Taylors Shaft chimney.jpgTaylor's shaft chimney File:East Pool Mine Taylor's Shaft loader lift cabins breaker and pumping engine house.jpgBreaker in the background File:East Pool Mine Taylor's Shaft pump piston.jpgTaylor's shaft pump house File:East Pool Mine Taylor's Shaft cage.jpgTaylor's shaft cage File:East Pool mine, Michells Shaft engine house.jpgThe engine house at Michell's Shaft See also *Cornish steam engine *Mining in Cornwall and Devon ReferencesSources (The data for East Pool is available online at )  * External links *East Pool Mine (National Trust) Mines in Cornwall Tin mines in Cornwall Arsenic mines in Cornwall Industrial archaeological sites in Cornwall Industry museums in England Grade II* listed buildings in Cornwall Mining museums in Cornwall National Heritage List for England National Trust properties in Cornwall Buildings and structures in Cornwall Steam museums in England Preserved beam engines Cornish engines ","title":"East Pool mine"},{"id":"23848979","text":"Thomas Michael John Kempinski (born 24 March 1938) is an English playwright and actor best known for his 1980 play Duet for One, which was a major success in London and New York City, and much revived since.

P.= It was in the 2006-07 season that he made his debut in the First Macedonian Football League with FK Makedonija Gjorƒçe Petrov after signing from FK Tikvesh. He immediately made an impact in the squad and in the next season he became a key defensive player of the ambitious team. His 28 league appearances with 2 goals made his earn a call for the national team while he was still only 20 years old.

There, he first lived in Manitou Springs and later in Colorado Springs. By his own account, Shoup \\"grew up listening to black music in the South, the blues and jazz and R&B;,\\" was \\"introduced to free jazz in the late '60s‚Ä¶ in Atlanta\\". Although his \\"voice is definitely influenced by African-American music\\" he \\"kind of felt like free jazz was the domain of black musicians.\\" Hearing Britain's Music Improvisation Company, \\"he simultaneously discovered free improvisation and his calling as a musician.\\"Biography, Wally Shoup official site at speakeasy.org. Accessed online 2009-09-07. \\"It wasn't jazz-based,\\" he would say in 2003.\\" They were trying to find some new ways of improvising. I realized that was the kind of music I wanted to know about, and the only way I could know more about it was by playing it.\\" While in Colorado, Shoup had a three-hour weekly show on KRCC, the Colorado College radio station, where by Jason Heller's account (2003) he played jazz and experimental music from his own extensive collection, and \\"began using the studio itself as an instrument, manipulating multiple turntables and mixing in guest musicians who would improvise over the records‚Ä¶\\" Describing a band he organized during this period, the Creative Music Ensemble (active circa 1973‚Äì74), Shoup later said, \\"I was still developing some chops on the sax, so I wasn't a player yet; I was just the instigator. I had them play a number of gigs, and it just outraged and pissed people off. ‚Ä¶ People didn't know what to make of it. It was kind of like Mahavishnu meets Merzbow or something.\\" In 1975 he became an active organizer, deejay, and player of music merging free jazz, free improvisation and noise. After deciding he was ready to play the saxophone as a performer, he formed his first trio, in Colorado, with Ross Rabin and Keith Gardner, incorporating contact microphones on metal objects to create \\"noisescapes.\\" He released his first album, Scree-Run Waltz in 1981. In 1983 he moved to Birmingham, Alabama where he performed with Trans Duo (Davey Williams and LaDonna Smith), wrote for the Improvisor magazine and worked with dancer Mary Horn, with whom he toured European in 1985, after which he moved to Seattle. Shortly after arriving in Seattle, Shoup became an early organizer of that city's Improvised Music Festival, which began that year, and which is now the United States' longest-running improvised music festival. Among the groups he performed with there were the New Art Orchestra and Catabatics. In 2010 he will participate in and help organize the 25th anniversary Seattle Improvised Music Festival. In 1994 he and cellist Brent Arnold formed Project W, who would eventually open for Sonic Youth in Seattle in 1998. Writing in 1999, Andrew Bartlett described this as \\"Shoup's most vaunted ensemble‚Ä¶ whose debut CD of the same name on the Apraxia label has become the stuff of legend.\\" Bartlett singled out their emphasis on relatively short pieces as unusual for free improvisors. Shoup has done two CDs with Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth Hurricane Floyd (Subliminal, 2000) and Live at Tonic (Leo Records, 2003Live at Tonic, Leo Records. Accessed online 2009-08-03.) with Paul Flaherty and Chris Corsano. He has also made two recordings with Nels Cline of Wilco: Immolation/Immersion (CD, 2005) and Suite: Bittersweet (LP, 2007), both on Strange Attractors Audio House. Shoup formed the Wally Shoup Trio in 2001 with bassist Reuben Radding and drummer Bob Rees. Speaking of his work in 2003, Shoup said, \\"I'm not quite as abstract as I used to be.

This perseverance of effort promotes the overcoming of obstacles or challenges that lie on the path to accomplishment and serves as a driving force in achievement realization. Distinct but commonly associated concepts within the field of psychology include \\"perseverance\\", \\"hardiness\\", \\"resilience\\", \\"ambition\\", \\"need for achievement\\" and \\"conscientiousness\\". These constructs can be conceptualized as individual differences related to the accomplishment of work rather than talent or ability. This distinction was brought into focus in 1907 when William James challenged the field to further investigate how certain individuals are capable of accessing richer trait reservoirs enabling them to accomplish more than the average person, but the construct dates back at least to Francis Galton, and the ideals of persistence and tenacity have been understood as a virtue at least since Aristotle. Definition Grit was defined as \\"perseverance and passion for long-term goals\\" by psychologist Angela Duckworth and colleagues, who extensively studied grit as a personality trait. They observed that individuals high in grit were able to maintain their determination and motivation over long periods despite experiences with failure and adversity. They concluded that grit is a better predictor of success than intellectual talent (IQ), based on their evaluation of educational attainment by adults, GPA among Ivy League undergraduates, dropout rate of cadets at West Point US Military Academy, and ranking in the National Spelling Bee. Earlier studies of achievement often emphasized the notion that high-achieving individuals typically possess traits above and beyond that of normal ability.Galton, Francis (1892). Hereditary genius. New York: Appleton.Cox, C.M. (1926). Genetic studies of genius: Vol. 2. The early mental traits of three hundred geniuses. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.Terman, L.M. & Oden, M.H. (1947). The gifted child grows up: Twenty-five years' follow-up of a superior group. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press. Duckworth et al. emphasized that grit is a better predictor of achievement than intellectual talent (IQ), because grit serves as the overriding factor that provides the stamina required to \\"stay the course\\" amid challenges and setbacks. Marcus Crede and colleagues later observed that the contribution of grit to the prediction of success mostly stems from the perseverance of effort, and they questioned the inclusion of consistency of interest (passion) as one of the aspects of grit, as defined by Duckworth et al. Literature comparisons=Grit and positive psychology= Grit also ties in with positive psychology and in particular, with perseverance. As mentioned earlier, the ability to stick with and pursue a goal over a long period is an important aspect of grit. This area of positive psychology has been interested in the process of perseverance as a positive indicator of long term success.Peterson, C., Seligman, M.E. (2004). Character strengths and virtues: A handbook and classification. Oxford: Oxford University Press. A 2014 study by Von Culin, Tsukayama and Duckworth found that individual differences in grit and its two component facets‚Äîperseverance of effort and consistency of interests over time‚Äîmay derive in part from differences in what makes people happy. =Grit and intelligence= One of the best predictors of future achievement has been intelligence. This relationship has been found in scholastic achievement as well as in job performance. As such, one might expect that grit would be strongly correlated with intelligence. In fact, this prompted one of the early questions asked in grit research, \\"Why do some individuals accomplish more than others of equal intelligence?\\". Somewhat surprisingly, in four separate samples, grit was found to be either orthogonal to or slightly inversely correlated with intelligence. This means that grit, unlike many traditional measures of performance, is not tied to intelligence. The researchers suggested that this helps explain why some very intelligent individuals do not consistently perform well over long periods. =Grit and personality measures= The grit measure has been compared to the Big Five personality traits, which are a group of broad personality dimensions consisting of openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. In one study by Duckworth and Quinn (2009), the Short Grit Scale (Grit‚ÄìS) and 12-item self-report measure of grit (Grit‚ÄìO) measuring grit was strongly correlated with conscientiousness (r = .77, p <.001 and r = .73, p <.001). A large study of twins measuring both conscientiousness and grit found that they had a genetic correlation of 0.86. A subsequent meta-analysis found that the grit was functionally a measure of conscientiousness. Despite these high correlations with conscientiousness, it is suggested that grit is more strongly associated with longer term and multi- year goals such as education. Large studies suggest only weak links of grit to these long term goals, much smaller than links to IQ and to conscientiousness. Grit is also similar to need for achievement, but is suggested to relate to extremely long-term goals pursued without positive feedback, while need for achievement is suggested to lack this long-term component. =Comparison with related psychological constructs= Traditional constructs in this area include perseverance, hardiness, resilience, ambition, self-control, and need for achievement. Grit has been argued to be distinguishable from each of these in the following ways. Perseverance is the steadfast pursuit of a task, mission, or journey in spite of obstacles, discouragement, or distraction. In contrast, grit is argued to be a trait of perseverance. Grit enables an individual to persevere in accomplishing a goal despite obstacles over an extended period. When compared with the construct of persistence, grit adds a component of passion for the goal.Hancock, P.A., & Szalma, J.L. (2008). \\"Stress and performance\\". In Hancock, P.A. & Szalma (Eds.). Performance under stress. Cornwall: MPG Books. This goal passion also contributes to the ability of the individual to sustain effort over the long term. Salvatore Maddi (2006) defined hardiness as a combination of attitudes that provide the courage and motivation to do the hard, strategic work of turning stressful circumstances from potential disasters into growth opportunities. While grit is primarily a measure of an individual's ability to persist in obtaining a specific goal over an extended time period (Duckworth et al., 2007), hardiness refers to an individual's ability to persist through difficult circumstances and does not address the individual's long term persistence toward a specific goal. Maddi (2006) developed a theoretical model of hardiness as a tool for developing resilience. Resilience is a dynamic process in which an individual overcomes significant adversity, usually in the form of a life changing event or difficult personal circumstances. Resilience can be conceptualized as an adaptive response to a challenging situation. Grit involves maintaining goal focused effort for extended periods of time, often while facing adversity but does not require a critical incident. Importantly, grit is conceptualized as a trait while resilience is a dynamic process. Finally, resilience has been almost exclusively studied in children who are born into \\"at-risk\\" situations. Although resilience researchers recognize that adults likely demonstrate resilience in a similar manner to children, the resilience process has not been studied in a mature population. Ambition is broadly defined as the desire for attainment, power, or superiority. In contrast to ambition, grit is not associated with seeking fame or external recognition for achievements. Ambition is often associated with a desire for fame. Unlike ambitious individuals, gritty individuals do not seek to distinguish themselves from other people, but to obtain personal goals. Self-control, an aspect of inhibitory control, is the ability to control one's emotions and behavior in the face of temptations and impulses. Duckworth and James Gross (2014) used a hierarchical-goal perspective on self-control and grit to show that while both these constructs entail aligning actions with intentions, they operate in different ways and over different timescales and are distinct psychological mechanisms that are key determinants of success. David McClelland (1961) described need for achievement as a drive to complete manageable goals that enable the individual to receive immediate feedback.McClelland, D.C. (1961). The achieving society. Oxford, England: Van Nostrand. In contrast to need for achievement, gritty individuals consciously set long-term goals that are difficult to attain and do not waver from these difficult goals, regardless of the presence of feedback. Additionally, need for achievement has been studied for almost 50 years and has been found to positively correlate to self- efficacy and learning goal orientation. These links have not yet been tested in the grit literature. Scientific findings and controversy The primary scientific findings on grit come from Duckworth and colleagues' 2007 examination of grit as an individual difference trait capable of predicting long-term success. Subsequently, in a 2016 meta-analysis of the structure and correlates of grit, Crede et al. questioned Duckworth's construct of grit (that included both the perseverance of effort facet and the consistency of interest facet), concluding that the primary utility of the grit construct may stem from the perseverance of effort. Duckworth et al. (2007) initially proposed that individuals who possess a drive to tirelessly work through challenges, failures, and adversity to achieve set goals are uniquely positioned to reach higher achievements than others who lack similar stamina. In a series of six studies Duckworth et al. proposed, developed, and tested a two-factor grit scale with notable results. In addition to validating their grit scale, the authors also found support suggesting that grit provided incremental predictive validity for education and age above and beyond the Big Five personality traits (Study 2); that higher levels of grit were more highly associated with cumulative grade point average (GPA) in an Ivy league sample when compared to those with lower grit levels (r = .25, p < .01; Study 3); that grit predicted retention after their first summer in two classes of cadets at the United States Military Academy (Study 4); and that participants in a National Spelling Bee with higher grit scores typically work harder and longer than less gritty peers, ultimately resulting in better performance. This series of studies provides empirical evidence that an individual difference conceptualized as grit can account for significant variance in performance across a variety of settings. Although Duckworth argued that grit predicted academic performance better than the Big Five personality traits, that claim was later called into question by Kaili Rimfeld and colleagues, who argued that Big Five personality factors have equal predictive ability, and by Crede, who concluded that grit is very strongly correlated with conscientiousness, and found that after controlling for conscientiousness, only one component of grit (perseverance of effort) explains variance in academic performance. Rimfeld et al. in 2016 conducted the largest study of grit in the United Kingdom, that was based on academic achievement of 2,321 twin pairs (U.K.-representative sample and genetically sensitive design), and compared the predictive ability of grit as a trait (measured by the Grit-S) to the predictions based on Big Five personality traits. Rimfeld et al. found that while personality is a significant predictor of academic achievement, grit as a separate construct added little to the prediction of academic achievement derived from Big Five personality factors, such as conscientiousness. See also: Crede, Tynan, and Harms in 2016 conducted a meta-analytic synthesis of prior empirical research on grit by summarizing data from 88 independent samples and over 66,000 individuals, and found that grit is only moderately correlated with performance, and that only one component of grit that was described by Duckworth et al. in 2007 (perseverance of effort) explains variance in academic performance. The study consequently suggested to separate consistency of interest (passion) from the perseverance (effort), since Crede et al. observed that contribution of grit to the prediction of success mostly stems from the perseverance of effort. Psychologist K. Anders Ericsson, in his 2016 book Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise, criticized the tendency to credit persistent practice to traits such as grit or willpower; he wrote: \\"It may seem natural to assume that these people who maintain intense practice schedules for years have some rare gift of willpower or 'grit' or 'stick-to-itiveness' that the rest of us just lack, but that would be a mistake for two very compelling reasons.\\" The first reason is that motivation is a situation-specific attribute: People generally find it easier to practice in some areas than in others. The second reason is that grit and willpower are traits that are assigned to someone after the fact, for example: John practiced persistently for years, so he must have incredible grit. But, Ericsson explained: \\"This sort of circular thinking‚Äî'The fact that I couldn't keep practicing indicates that I don't have enough willpower, which explains why I couldn't keep practicing'‚Äîis worse than useless; it is damaging in that it can convince people that they might as well not even try.\\" Instead of attributing success to grit or willpower, Ericsson recommended analyzing the various factors that shape a person's motivation in a given situation. Since 2014, grit has been the subject of critical commentary and debate in Education Week, with contributors discussing the strengths and weaknesses of how the idea of grit has been used by educators. Some contributors called \\"the grit narrative\\" a kind of victim blaming when educators who emphasize grit downplay the obstacles that some students face such as conditions of poverty, racism, and ineffective teaching.Among the relevant articles and blog posts in Education Week are:   The idea that grit can be enhanced was also criticized in a 2019 paper by Moreau and colleagues.

It began on 8 August 2009, at 11:45 pm and immediately followed Match of the Day on Saturdays. Similar to other BBC Sport studio shows, UK-based users of the BBC website could watch a live simulcast of the programme. The programme was made in Studio C at IMG studios, London. Football League highlights moved to Channel 5 for the 2015‚Äì2016 season, thus ending the BBC's version of the programme. Format The programme had a similar format to ITV's Championship Goals, with a featured match receiving full highlights and all the goals from the other matches (thus repeating Match of the Day's format used in the early to the mid 90s). There could also be extensive highlights of any matches covered live by Sky Sports or the BBC itself. The programme was studio based. The first ever episode featured Steve Claridge alongside Crystal Palace manager Ian Holloway but from the second episode onwards only featured Claridge as pundit or on some occasions former Torquay United and Brentford manager Leroy Rosenior. Occasionally both Claridge and Rosenior have appeared on the same programme offering analysis of matches. When there were only Championship or League One and League Two matches played, the show was pre recorded from the stadium of the featured match, rather than being live from the studio. These shows were often shorter than the regular ones. On 23 March 2013, the show was only 20 minutes long, this being the shortest show in the series and the first not to have a featured matches. Presenter, commentators and reporters The presenter of the show was Manish Bhasin, who left Football Focus to present. Whenever Bhasin was unavailable, the programme was hosted by Mark Chapman, Mark Clemmit, Damian Johnson or Jason Mohammad. Freelance journalists regularly voiced goal round-ups. These included Channel 5's UEFA Europa League commentator Dave Beckett, Nick Halling who is best known as Sky Sports' American Football expert, ESPN and talkSPORT's Jim Proudfoot and Peter Brackley who also works on ITV. Freelance commentators primarily working with the BBC such as John Roder, Jonathan Legard and Alistair Mann also appeared, commentating both on round-ups and featured games. Tony Jones and John Helm have also commentated on the show. Other commentators included Kevin Keatings, Jon Champion, Peter Drury, Jonathan Pearce, Guy Mowbray and Steve Wilson. BBC Radio 5 Live's Mark Clemmit was the roving reporter, who visited a ground to spend the day with a team each week. This was similar in style to Kevin Day's reports on Match of the Day 2. Interactive There was also an interactive email segment where fans expressed their points of view. These emails were read out by one of the BBC's sports news presenters, mainly Jacqui Oatley or Lizzie Greenwood-Hughes. This feature was dropped from the start of the 2011‚Äì12 football season. Other programmes The BBC's rights deal with the Football League also included the Football League Cup, where the programme was rebranded as The Football League Cup Show. Highlights of the Football League Trophy final were also shown on the BBC, where the show was simply branded as the Football League Trophy Final. Rather than being broadcast live from a studio, it was recorded pitchside from Wembley Stadium, the venue of the final. Highlights from the earlier rounds were available on the BBC Sport website up until the 2011‚Äì12 season. A regional spin-off programme, Late Kick Off, launched on Monday 18 January 2010, broadcasting weekly from January until the end of the season. End of the programme In 2015, the BBC lost the rights to the Football League to Channel 5 beginning in August of that year, with Channel 5 offering the same money that the BBC paid for the previous three years but promising to show highlights at 9 pm, rather than after Match of the Day, which had been the traditional home while on the BBC. The last Football League Show aired on 25 May 2015, with highlights of the Championship play-off final from Wembley Stadium between Middlesbrough and Norwich City. The final few editions of the Football League Show featured memories and highlights from the past six seasons and featured credits naming all who worked on the show. Channel 5 showed highlights from the Football League's competitions on its own programme, Football League Tonight until August 2018 when they show the highlights on QUEST.

HRG. 112‚Äì745 (112th Congress, 2012). Kendall is a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point. Commissioned in the US Army, he served in Germany during the 1970s before transferring to the Army Reserve, during which time he also lectured at the West Point. He resigned commission as a lieutenant colonel. He also holds a Master's degree in aeronautical engineering from California Institute of Technology, a Master of Business Administration degree (MBA) from C.W Post Center of Long Island University and a Juris Doctor from Georgetown University Law Center. At the USMA, Kendall was a classmate of Jack Reed, who is currently serving as senior United States Senator from Rhode Island. In January 2015, a report by the Defense Business Board and consultants from McKinsey & Company discovered DoD was spending $134 billion, 23% of its total budget, on back-office work, and that the back-office bureaucracy staff of over one million people was nearly as great as the number of active duty troops. According to the report, DoD's purchasing bureaucracy staff of 207,000 would be among the top 30 private sector employers in the United States. On January 22, 2015, the Board then voted to recommend adoption of McKinsey's five-year plan to cut $125 billion in waste. Under Secretary Kendall responded to the management consulting by asking \\"Are you trying to tell me we don't know how to do our job?\\" and that the report's conclusions were \\"essentially a ballpark, made-up number\\". Kendall then argued that he could not achieve any efficiencies and, instead, that he needed to hire 1,000 more staff. After Secretary Chuck Hagel was replaced by Ash Carter the next month, Kendall warned Deputy Secretary Robert O. Work that the McKinsey report could \\"be used as a weapon\\" against the defense budget. Secretary Carter then replaced the Board chairman, classified the McKinsey results as secret, and removed the report from public websites. After Navy Secretary Ray Mabus gave a speech at the American Enterprise Institute highlighting the McKinsey report, Under Secretary Kendall wrote to him asking \\"please refrain from taking any more public pot shots\\" and \\"I do not want this spilling over into further public discourse.\\" In his civilian life Kendall has performed pro bono human rights work. According to his official DoD biography he served on the board of directors of Amnesty International, of Human Rights First and of the Tahirih Justice Center. He has traveled to the Guantanamo Bay detention camps, as a human rights observer.

He was \\"an able and intriguing man\\" ‚Äì Horace Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford. Political career Carter was Member of Parliament MP for Trim in County Meath, from 1719 to 1727. In 1727 he was returned as a member for Hillsborough, Dungarvan, and Lismore, but chose to sit for Hillsborough, and held the seat until 1761. The Carters were a political family. Thomas Carter, the first to live at Castlemartin which he acquired in 1729, was made Master of the Rolls in Ireland in 1731, which office he had continued to hold until 1754. He was a skilful and experienced parliamentarian and political organiser. A strong, if not often violent Whig, noted for his rudeness and his loathing of English ministerial interference in Irish affairs and his satirical lampooning of political opponents earned him the nickname \\"Vicious Carter\\". During the late 1740s Carter became one of the leaders of the country of Ireland as a member of the Patriot party along with Henry Boyle, speaker of the Irish House of Commons and Anthony Malone, the Prime Sergeant. He was made Master of the Rolls in 1731 but as one of the parliamentary managers employed by the Lord Lieutenant to ensure that the King's business was passed in the House of Commons, his actions were often maverick. Horace Walpole said of him that he had \\"Constantly fomented every discontent against the Lord Lieutenants in order to be bought off\\". Such behaviour was common in 18th century politics where interest was so often for sale. Quite content to \\"feather his own nest\\" Carter did not always help his colleagues. The Money Bill dispute Both the zenith and the nadir of Carter's career came during the Money Bill dispute of the 1750s. The crisis came in 1753‚Äì56 when the Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland, Henry Boyle, refused to hand over an Irish tax surplus to London. As a result, Primate Stone Archbishop of Armagh, tried to reduce the influence of the leading parliamentary undertakers; Speaker Boyle, Anthony Malone and Thomas Carter. The archbishop tried to replace them with his own supporters, the Ponsonbys led by the Earl of Bessborough. Boyle, Malone and Carter whipped up popular support, turning the issue into a trial of strength between the Lord Lieutenant and the country or \\"Patriot\\" party. Boyle, helped by Carter's wickedly provocative tongue, began a whispering campaign against Primate Stone. There was a personal antagonism between Carter and Primate Stone as the latter had been instrumental in foiling Carter's attempts to obtain the reversion of his office of Master of the Rolls for his young unknown and inexperienced son. The whole episode of the Money Bill dispute, the motives, intrigues, manoeuvrings and chicanery was wittily and ironically described by Edmund Sexton Pery, an eye-witness and MP for Wicklow town. His description is written in the form of a letter to the Duke of Bedford around the time he was appointed Lord Lieutenant in 1757. The dispute became an oft-quoted precedent to the policy of the Irish Patriot Party of the 1780s. Family Thomas Carter was born in 1690, the son of Thomas Carter (1650‚Äì1726) and his wife born Margaret Houghton, of Robertstown, County Kildare. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin and the King's Inns. He married 12 October 1719 at St Anne's, Dublin, Mary Claxton, youngest daughter of Thomas Claxton of Dublin and Lucy Pearce, and so first-cousin of Edward Lovett Pearce who built them a magnificent house at No.9 Henrietta Street with the finest staircase hall in Dublin. They had two sons and three daughters. Their daughter Frances was mother of Frances, Lady Jersey. Their daughter Susan was grandmother of Elizabeth, Marchioness of Thomond. Thomas Carter made significant contributions to farming and country pursuits, not sparing any expense to bring them to perfection. He imported the best breed of cattle. Castle Martin in the snow He originally leased Castle Martin in the early 1730s as his country seat, and did not buy the house and that estate until 1761, just two years before he died while staying with his elder son, Thomas MP, at Rathnally House, Trim. Twelve days after his father's deathThe puzzling behavior of (cattle-breeder) father and son might be explained if the, evidently kindly regarded, younger Thomas, MP, (dead by 1766 when his widow remarried) had been crippled in his youth by tuberculosis and forbidden by his father to marry for fear of passing on the then mysterious bovine-sourced infection. A male heir (not the heiress that resulted) may have had a good case to obtain his grandfather's estates. Thomas proceeded with his marriage to Anna Armytage, daughter of the Yorkshire baronet Sir Samuel Armytage, but they had just one child, Mary, later Mrs Skeffington Thompson, before young Thomas Carter MP himself died. So Carter was succeeded at Castlemartin by his second son Henry Boyle Carter, named after his father's friend and political ally, Speaker Boyle. In 1750 Henry married Susanna Shaen, widow of James Wynne, daughter of Sir Arthur Shaen, 2nd baronet, and his Catholic wife Susanna Magan, by whom Henry had three sons and one daughter. (see Carter-Campbell of Possil). Carter's descendants continued to live at Castlemartin until they sold the estate to the Blackers in 1850. =Thomas Carter (1650‚Äì1726) M.P. father of Thomas Carter (1690‚Äì1763)= Thomas Carter the elder was obviously a very ambitious young man, he married firstly Margaret Houghton (c. 1660-1696) on 16 December 1681 at St. Audoen's Church, Dublin. During the revolution he served with distinction at Derry and the Boyne where according to Burke's Irish Landed Gentry (1850 edition) he secured books and writings belonging to James II of England. What happened to these papers is not known. He was elected as an MP to the Irish House of Commons and became Second Sergeant at Arms being returned first for Fethard and then for Portarlington. He married secondly, Isabella, the dowager Countess Roscommon on 2 August 1702 by which marriage he acquired the extensive Roscommon estates in and around Trim. The Countess was born Isabella Boynton. They had no children and she died in 1721. Thomas Carter's father's seat was at Robertstown, County Meath.

Pegasus has frequently appeared on airmail stamps, such as this early example from Italy, 1930. Elements of Greek mythology appear many times in culture, including pop culture. The Greek myths spread beyond the Hellenistic world when adopted (for example) into the culture of ancient Rome, and Western cultural movements have frequently incorporated them ever since, particularly since the Renaissance. Mythological elements feature in Renaissance art and in English poems, as well as in film and in other literature, and in songs and commercials. Along with the Bible and the classics-saturated works of Shakespeare, the myths of Greece and Rome have been the major \\"touchstone\\" in Western culture for the past 500 years. Elements appropriated or incorporated include the gods of varying stature, humans, demigods, titans, giants, monsters, nymphs, and famed locations. Their use can range from a brief allusion to the use of an actual Greek character as a character in a work.

In painting and sculpture  Particularly starting in the Renaissance, artists across Europe produced thousands of works of art depicting the Greek deities and their myths, for reasons ranging from the erudite to the political to the erotic. In particular, in certain periods it was permissible to depict pagan deities nude when it would have been scandalous to so depict a human model or character. Romans would frequently keep statuary of the Greek god Dionysus, the Greek god of wine and pleasure, in their homes to use as a method of sanctioning relaxation without \\"any intellectual demands.\\" Medusa's likeness has been featured by numerous artists including Leonardo da Vinci, Peter Paul Rubens, Pablo Picasso, Auguste Rodin and Benvenuto Cellini.Wilk, Stephen R.

In literature  Percy Shelley's work translating the poem Prometheus Unbound (depicted here by Joseph Severn) also helped inspire Mary Shelley to write Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus Some stories in the Arabian Nights, such as the story of Sinbad blinding a giant, are thought to have been inspired by Greek myths. In 1816, Percy Shelley had been working on a translation of Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound for Lord Byron. That summer, Shelley and his lover, Mary Godwin, as well as others, stayed with Lord Byron in Switzerland. As a contest, Byron suggested that they each write a ghost story. Mary, who would eventually adopt the name Mary Shelley, began writing her Gothic novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus, which was declared the winner of the contest. The fact that she overtly subtitled the novel emphasizes Shelley's inspiration from the story of Prometheus, drawing particular attention to the \\"metaphorical parallels.\\" In Irish literature, writers such as Seamus Heaney have used the Greek myths to \\"intertextualize\\" the actions of the British Government.

The Italian poet Dante Alighieri used characters from the legend of Troy in his Divine Comedy, placing the Greek heroes in hell to show his contempt for their actions. Poets of the Renaissance began to widely write about Greek mythology, and \\"elicited as much praise for borrowing or reworking\\" such material as they did for truly original work. The poet John Milton used figures from classical mythology to \\"further Christianity: to teach a Christian moral or illustrate a Christian virtue.\\" Euphrosyne, Hymen and Hebe appear in his L'Allegro.\\"Milton, L'Allegro and Il Penseroso\\" Works of Alexander Pope, such as \\"The Rape of the Lock\\", parody classical works, even as the income from his translations of Homer allowed him to become \\"the first English writer to earn a living solely through his literature.\\" In Ode to a Nightingale, John Keats rejects \\"charioted by Bacchus and his pards.\\"John Keats, Ode To A Nightingale In his poem \\"Endymion\\", the \\"song of the Indian Maid\\" recounts how \\"Bacchus and his crew\\" interrupted the maid in her solitude.\\"John Keats: Poetry, Song of the Indian Maid, from Endymion\\" He titled an 1898 narrative poem Lamia.http://www.bartleby.com/126/36.html Keats's poem Lamia Alfred, Lord Tennyson's \\"Oenone\\" is her lament that Paris deserted her for Helen.\\"RPO -- Alfred, Lord Tennyson Oenone \\" When poets of the German Romantic tradition, such as Friedrich Schiller, wrote about the Greek gods, their works were frequently \\"erotically charged,\\" as they were \\"openly sensual and hedonistic.\\" In \\"The Waste Land\\", T.

Hofmannsthal adapted his work to become the libretto for Richard Strauss' opera Elekra in 1909. The opera, although controversial for both its \\"modern\\" music and its depiction of Elektra through \\"psycho-sexual symbolism,\\" inspired many more adaptations of Electra by other writers and composers during the twentieth century. * Sartre and Jean Anouilh used Greek myths as inspiration for their plays during the Nazi occupation of France, as the \\"distancing effect\\" of the ancient settings allowed their critique to bypass censors. Later, Heiner M√ºller also used the coding of Greek mythology to disguise his commentaries calling for reform within the German Democratic Republic. * The Architects (2012) is a play by the London-based Shunts predicated on the myth of the Minotaur, and is about a \\"return to when Greece was the cradle of civilisation and not about riots on the streets.\\" * The 2016 stage musical Hadestown, a production with music by Anais Mitchell, follows the stories of Orpheus and Eurydice as well as Hades and Persephone.

Riordan states that he created the character of Percy when trying to tell a story to help his son who has ADHD get interested in reading.

Claudio Monteverdi and Giacomo Badoaro used a Greek text about the homecoming of Odysseus as the basis for Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria over which they attempted to overlay Christian beliefs and create in Zeus an omnipotent and merciful being. Cherubini's M√©d√©e takes the story which had been portrayed in many version on the French stage as a melodrama, and instead portrays Medea as a tragic heroine who deserves the audiences' sympathy.  Rejection of use  During the Middle Ages, writers disdained the use of \\"pagan\\" influences such as Greek mythology which were seen to be a \\"slight to Christianity.\\" From a current cultural perspective, the Greek Orthodox metropolitan Agustinos Kantiotis has denounced the use of Greek mythology such as the use of Hermes on a postage stamp and the incorporation of images from Greek mythology into universities' logos and buildings. Greek women poets of the modern era; such as Maria Polydouri, Pavlina Pamboudi, Myrtiotissa, Melissanthi and Rita Boumi- Pappa; rarely use mythological references, which Christopher Robinson attributes to the \\"problem of gender roles, both inside and outside the myths.\\" Martin Winter says that the idea that many commentaries about the widespread use of Greek myths throughout Western culture does not take into account the vast difference between what a modern viewer takes from the story and what it would have meant to an ancient Greek.

It formed as a result of collaboration between activists from various political backgrounds around the 2006 Heathrow Camp for Climate Action, during which activists were involved in engaging with aviation and transport workers working in and around Heathrow. WCA was central to worker-engagement and outreach around the 2007 Kingsnorth climate camp, staging daily visits to the gates of the power plant to talk to workers. In 2009, WCA activists were the first to respond to the announcement of the closure of the Vestas wind turbine blades factory on the Isle of Wight and were integral to organising the 3 July public meeting which began the organising process which culminated in an ongoing worker occupation of the factory. WCA stands for a worker-led just transition to a low-carbon economy and believes that organised labour, particularly in frontline industries such as aviation, energy and transport is a key agent which is fundamentally capable of effecting meaningful social change. It looks to the history of working-class environmentalism and direct action, including the Lucas Aerospace workers' struggle of the 1970s and the New South Wales Builders' Labourers Federation's \\"Green Bans\\" as inspiring lessons for contemporary struggle and sees tactics such as sit-down strikes as crucial. It also seeks to struggle within the trade union movement to change what it sees as the conservative policies of some unions on issues like aviation, coal mining and nuclear power, as well as supporting the self-organisation of workers in the energy industry.

The word 'barnbrack' is a play on the Anglicised Irish word \\"Barmbrack\\", a type of bread that contains fruit. Barnbrack separated in 2003, after the premature death of Quinn‚Äôs wife, Deirdre, aged 55. While Barnbrack have had many popular songs, such as \\"The Fly\\" and the \\"Unicorn Song\\", the band's only noted chart success was with a single called \\"Belfast\\", written by Lisburn-born man and band member Alex Quinn. The song described the feelings felt by an expatriate, who is planning to return to Ulster and the city he left behind. The song was released on the Homespun label. It entered the UK Singles Chart on 16 March 1985, and reached #45; it was in the chart for several weeks. In 2009, the Belfast Telegraph reported that, after six years apart, the former members of the band were planning a reunion. The band is now back together and is currently touring Northern Ireland.

Harwood Street between Main and Commerce Street in the Main Street District of downtown Dallas, Texas that served as the city's fourth City Hall. The structure is also a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark and a contributing property in the Harwood Street Historic District, located across the street from Main Street Garden Park. History The City purchased land for the fourth City Hall between 1911 and 1912 from Eliza Trice, Otto H. Lang and the Sweeney Family. Designed by C. D. Hill & Company in the Beaux-Arts style, plans were drawn up in 1913 and the Spring Fred A. Jones Building Company began construction. The building company filed for bankruptcy later that year, and the Board of Commissioners passed a resolution to accept the sale and transfer of materials to C. C. Street, Jr., who completed the building. The Municipal Building opened October 17, 1914. In 1956, the Municipal Building Annex was completed at 2014 Main St. and attached as a connected building to 106 S. Harwood and became the home to the Dallas Police Department.Dallas City Hall Dallas Morning News 11/24/08 After the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested and jailed in the Municipal Building on November 22, 1963. Two days later, he was fatally shot by Jack Ruby while being led out by police in the basement garage. Dallas City Hall vacated the structure in 1978 when it moved to its current location at 1500 Marilla St. In 2003, the Dallas Police Department moved its offices to the new Jack Evans Police Headquarters at 1400 S. Lamar St, leaving only municipal courts in the building. The building suffered partial abandonment and neglect as the city tried to find a new use for the historic structure. On June 19, 2009, Texas Governor Rick Perry signed SB 956 into law, establishing the first public law school in North Texas. University of North Texas at Dallas College of Law planned to begin taking applications in the Fall of 2013 for classes that began in 2014. Initially, courses were to be held at the nearby Universities Center at Dallas while extensive renovations of the Municipal Building are made. The building was then chosen to serve as the law school's permanent home and the municipal courts moved into a renovated Municipal Building Annex.University of North Texas See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Dallas County, Texas *Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks in Dallas County *List of Dallas Landmarks ReferencesExternal links *Dallas Morning News *UNT *City of Dallas *RESTORE a film by Mark Birnbaum Buildings and structures in Dallas Buildings and structures associated with the assassination of John F.

Micheli was born in the Italian village of Montichiari, and later moved to the nearby town of Brescia. The birth date is deduced from a document of 1550 in which Zanetto declared to be over 60 years old. The oldest record of Micheli is in the 1527 Custodie notturne (Night Guards) with the designation \\"Ioannettus de li violettis\\", but without the being described as a \\"sonator\\" (player) of that instrument as is in other instances of the documents. Other documents testify to his long and successful career as a \\"magister\\" (master) of string instruments. In 1533, he was quoted by Giovanni Maria Lanfranco in his musical and organological treatise Scintille di Musica edited in Brescia in 1533. In 1537 a notarial act is written that Zanetto has to make a consort 5 viols with alla the accessories like the bows and a good varnishing. In almost all the many documents on his activity the string instruments are predominant, and that the customers of the maker are the most distinguish nobles of Brescia. And more, in the archive documents Zanetto is called \\"master of violins\\" like all the other Brescian makers starting surely from 1558. But we have to remember that the word violin appear in Brescia in 1530 and 20 years later il all part of Italy and Europe. Some very rare and good instruments created by Micheli survive in museums and private collections around the world. Some were exhibited at the Maggini exposition in Brescia 2007. Micheli's son, Pellegrino Micheli, was also an instrument maker. References * Dassenno, Flavio - Ravasio, Ugo \\"Gasparo da Sal√≤ e la liuteria bresciana tra rinascimento e barocco\\".
