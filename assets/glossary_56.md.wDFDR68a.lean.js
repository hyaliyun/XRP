Career  Azezet Habtezghi Kidane, also known as Sister Aziza, was born in Eritrea and is now a British citizen. She worked as a nurse in Sudan and Ethiopia for 20 years and is a member of the Comboni Missionary Sisters. From 2010 Kidane began working as a nurse at an open clinic in Tel Aviv run by the Physicians for Human Rights-Israel. The clinic provided free healthcare to African refugees who had made the journey to Israel via the Sinai Peninsula. Kidane noticed that many of the refugees had suffered from enslavement, human trafficking and torture on their journeys and began recording this in a database. In all she took testimonies from more than 1,500 refugees using a questionnaire of her own design. The reports she compiled were passed to the Israeli police, US Department of State, the European Union and the United Nations. Kidane discovered that a network of torture camps existed in the Sinai that were used by people smugglers to extort money from the refugees. Around half of the refugees she interviewed had experienced these camps. The smugglers would force the refugees to call their families in Israel or Africa and torture them whilst they were listening in order to demand ransoms of up to $50,000. A fence built by the Israeli government in 2013 almost completely halted the flow of African migrants. Kidane now works to provide counselling to those already in Israel. Kidane co-founded Kuchinate, African Refugee Women's collective together with Dr Diddy Mymin Kahn. This collective provides economic, psychological and social empowerment. The collective makes and sells beautiful crocheted homewares and also take part in art collaborations to raise awareness about the plight of asylum seekers. Kidane is well known in the African community in Israel. She was awarded a Trafficking in People Report Hero Acting to End Modern Slavery award by the US Department of State in 2012, which was presented by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

In January 2007, after winning the confidence of provincial prefect Fernando Gonz√°lez, she was appointed to a public office in Ambato. Within a few months of this, she joined the Ecuadorian Constituent Assembly as the representative of Tungurahua. In the , Cabezas was elected to the National Assembly of Ecuador for Alliance PAIS and in short order became the Assembly's Vice President. She would later become President of the Permanent Specialized Commission for Food Sovereignty and Development of the Agriculture and Fisheries, under the jurisdiction of the Assembly. During her time in the Assembly, Cabezas promoted several of the key reforms of the government of Rafael Correa such as the eradication of the outsourcing of Ecuadorian labor and new regulations on mining and public enterprises. She also exerted some influence on other issues of the Correa's government, notably the trial of the former Attorney General and former Minister of Public Works and Transport, Jorge Mar√∫n. Her work in the Assembly would help Cabezas to climb the ladder of the Alliance PAIS and become a close confidant of President Correa. =Controversy over salary increase= In February 2011, Guayaquil-based newspaper El Universo published an investigative piece that uncovered a large increase in Cabezas's salary from $49,000 to $95,000 in a single year, which was not substantiated by Cabeza's assets. In addition, it was found that she had purchased a house in an exclusive neighborhood of Quito for $195,000. Included in the evidence against Cabezas were numerous donations made by relatives of C√©sar Mancheno to Cabezas's campaign. Cabezas responded to El Universos article by presenting slides showing her income and disbursements made to her in recent years during a press conference and denying any links to Mancheno. She did not allow any questions from attending journalists, and when pressed about the increase to her patrimonial assets, Cabezas left the conference room. As a result of the controversy, she became less visible among PAIS Alliance's ranks and during the was placed ninth in the list of PAIS Alliance candidates for the National Assembly, and she could not retain her seat. =Later political life= In March 2014, President Rafael Correa named Cabezas as Ecuador's ambassador to Honduras. She assumed the position in June, becoming the first ambassador of Ecuador to Honduras since the previous ambassador was withdrawn amidst the 2009 Honduran coup d'√©tat. In December of that year, Honduran deputy Osman Aguilar accused Cabezas of meddling in the internal politics of Honduras by publicly supporting the reelection campaign of Juan Orlando Hern√°ndez and acting as a consultant to the central government. Cabezas denied advising the Honduran government on political issues and asserted that relations between Honduras and Ecuador were purely for cooperation on social issues. At the end of May 2017, Cabezas was named the secretary of President Len√≠n Moreno's \\"Toda Una Vida\\" plan.

After the 1979 coup d'√©tat led to the installation of a military junta, she began documenting human rights abuses in the country, helping families report disappearances and imprisonments. Under personal threat and with escalating violations of rights, Garc√≠a took her documentation to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, gaining international notice of the situation inside the country. She was assassinated by the Salvadoran Armed Forces in 1983 and was posthumously awarded the Bruno Kreisky Prize for Services to Human Rights. Early life Marianella Garc√≠a Villas was born on 7 August 1948 in San Salvador, El Salvador to a well-to-do family. She was sent to Barcelona to complete her primary and secondary education and then returned to El Salvador and enrolled in the University of El Salvador to study law. While in university, she became involved in the university's Catholic youth organization. She completed her studies, graduating with a degree in law in 1969. Career In 1974, Garc√≠a was elected as a deputy to Parliament as a representative of the Christian Democratic Party (CDP), the only women to serve in the Legislative Assembly from 1974 to 1976. In 1978, she founded the first human rights commission in the country, (), to document the increasing violations of rights and numbers of political prisoners being detained and disappeared. The organization was independent from government control and Garc√≠a, as president shared the leadership of the organization with Roberto Cu√©llar, who operated a legal aid association. She became a contact point for families searching for information about their relatives. Because she kept detailed records of prisoners, union workers and members of the Populist Church who were under government surveillance and visited the prisons to gain information, she was able to assist families who needed information. Despite the accusations of \\"political motivation\\", Garc√≠a and her colleagues took photographs of victims. The documentation provided both a visual record of the atrocities, but also an archive for families looking for relatives. She also shared information about the violations in weekly reports to the Archbishop √ìscar Romero, who denounced the perpetrators and the terror being waged in weekly sermons and on the Jesuit-run radio program. In 1980, due to ideological differences when the CDP which supported the military junta that had led to the Salvadoran Civil War, she resigned from the party. Almost from the beginning of the CDHES, Garc√≠a began receiving threats. Her car was riddled with machine gun fire in April 1979 and on 13 March 1980 her offices were bombed. Ten days later, Archbishop Romero was assassinated during a mass. That same fall, Garc√≠a went to Geneva and met with Theo van Boven, head of the United Nations' Division for Human Rights to show him the archive of photographic evidence. Under continuing threats, Garc√≠a moved the offices of the CDHES to Mexico City and continued her international appeal for assistance to end the human rights violations in her country. Between October 1979 and December 1982, Garc√≠a‚Äôs records documented 3,200 forced disappearances, 43,337 murders, and over 700 imprisonments of political dissidents. She returned to El Salvador in February 1983 to photograph abuses and try to collect evidence of the use of chemical weapons by the Salvadoran Armed Forces for the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. She was captured on 13 March at the Hacienda La Bermuda, in Suchitoto, and taken to the nearby Military School where she was tortured. The military reports indicated that they had captured a guerrilla fighter. Death and legacy Garc√≠a was executed on 13 or 14 March 1983 and was posthumously awarded the Bruno Kreisky Prize for Services to Human Rights in 1984. She is remembered world wide for her commitment to human rights.

So far in the war, the Genoese had experienced only defeats in direct confrontations with the Venetian navy, and had therefore resorted to raiding the Venetian commerce convoys to the Levant, which were critical to the Venetian economy. In mid-1264, the Genoese commander, Simone Grillo, managed to trick his Venetian counterpart, Andrea Barozzi, as to his intentions: Grillo spread rumours that he intended to head due east to the Levant, whereas he secretly took up station at Malta, south of the usual sea lanes. When Barozzi took the bait and moved east to pursue Grillo with his much larger fleet, the latter was free to attack the Venetian convoy. Confident of the absence of any threat, the convoy commander, Michele Duaro, was caught by surprise when he encountered the Genoese fleet off Saseno. The much more manoeuvreable Genoese galleys captured or sunk most of the convoy's slow-moving merchant ships, except for the giant cargo vessel (nave) Roccafortis, where Duaro rallied his crews for safety. The cost of the convoy's loss to Venice was estimated at 100,000 Genoese pounds. Venice was able to destroy the Genoese fleet two years later, however, and in 1270 the two states concluded a truce that ended the war. Background The War of Saint Sabas, between the rival Italian maritime republics of Venice and Genoa, broke out in 1256, over access to, and control of, the ports and markets of the Eastern Mediterranean. With its victories in the Battle of Acre in 1258 and in the Battle of Settepozzi in 1263, the Venetian navy had demonstrated its superiority over its Genoese counterpart. Consequently the Genoese avoided direct confrontations with the Venetian battle fleet and engaged in commerce raiding against the Venetian merchant convoys. During the 13th century, the Republic of Venice sent out two trade convoys (muda) to trade in the east each year, one in spring and one in late summer. Normally the convoys split up, one part heading into the Aegean Sea and what the Venetians called \\"Romania\\" (the lands of the Byzantine Empire) and the Black Sea, while the other sailed southeast to Alexandria and the port cities of the Levant (Oltremare). The importance of these convoys to the Venetian economy can hardly be overstated: However, since the fall of the Latin Empire in 1261, Constantinople had been in the hands of the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos, whose alliance with the Genoese included the obligation of keeping their commercial rivals away from Byzantine-held lands and preventing passage into the Black Sea. As a result, the spring trade convoy to the Levant now represented Venice's \\"main overseas trading enterprise\\". Preparations A Genoese nave, by Quinto Cenni In spring 1264, \\"in order to crush the Venetian enemies and to ensure the well-being and defend the Genoese sailing in different parts of the world\\", the Genoese prepared a raiding fleet of twenty galleys and two large navi, crewed by 3,500 men. The navi in particular were of exceptional size, and had been built by public funds. The fleet was placed under the command of the pro-Ghibelline nobleman Simone Grillo. This led to fears among the rival Guelph party that he might use his new position for a coup that would make him dictator on the model of the only recently deposed \\"Captain of the People\\", Guglielmo Boccanegra. The Guelph nobles joined and attacked Grillo's house, and it took three days of negotiations before Grillo was able to secure terms that allowed him to take up his command. Grillo was forced to move to Porto Venere, at the southernmost extremity of Genoese territory, and there wait until the fleet was made ready; and he was also assigned four experienced sailors as councillors, with the added task of keeping an eye on his conduct, among them Ogerio Scoto and Pietro di Camilla. News of the Genoese preparations soon reached Venice, either through Grillo's political enemies or through the boasts of Genoese citizens. These reports greatly exaggerated the Genoese fleet's strength to as many as 90 galleys and six navi. Coupled with news of extensive recruitment of mercenaries in Lombardy, this news worried the Venetian authorities, who delayed the sailing of the spring convoy, and prepared a large fleet of their own to counter the Genoese, with about 50 ships, mostly galleys, under Andrea Barozzi (or Barocio). The naval historian John Dotson considers it possible that the exaggerated reports of the Genoese fleet were leaked deliberately by agents of Grillo, so as to \\"draw the Venetian fleet out in a predictable fashion\\". Grillo deceives Barozzi Grillo set sail in June, and swiftly headed south towards Malta, where he arrived after a few days. On his stops along the way, he took care to announce his intention to sail directly to Acre in the Levant. Instead, however, he remained at Malta much further south than the usual sea lanes, where his Venetian opponents might seek him. When Barozzi, reacting to the news of the Genoese fleet's sailing, arrived at Sicily to intercept it, he only found rumours of its departure. According to some Venetian accounts, Grillo left behind a small vessel whose crew, when captured by the Venetians, informed them that the Genoese fleet had passed that way four days earlier, heading due east for the Levant. Deceived, Barozzi led his fleet to pursue the Genoese, who were ostensibly heading east. At the same time, in Venice, the authorities, certain of Barozzi's eventual success given the past history of Venetian‚ÄìGenoese naval encounters, and unwilling to risk losing the profits of the trade convoy, finally decided to allow it to depart on 1 August. It comprised 13 taride, three navi, including the famously large Roccafortis, a panzone cargo ship, two light galleys, and a saetta scouting galley. The command of the convoy was entrusted to Michele Duaro or Doro. Grillo quickly became aware of the Venetian fleet's moves, and once he was certain that Barozzi was out of the way, he moved his fleet northeast. At about this point, Grillo decided to detach his two navi and three galleys and send them to trade in Tunisia, possibly after transferring their marines to the rest of his ships. Another galley was sent east; according to the Annali Genovesi on a mission to Palaiologos, but according to Dotson \\"it seems more likely that it was sent as a scout to keep watch on Barocio's movements\\". With the remaining 16 galleys, Grillo moved to the Strait of Otranto to await the Venetian trade convoy. The account of the Annali Genovesi‚Äîprobably based on Grillo's own report to the Genoese authoritities‚Äîjustifies Grillo's movements after reaching Malta by claiming that intelligence gathered from a Messinese merchant ship returning from the Levant suggested that the situation there was adverse to Genoese interests, so that nothing could be done that \\"would redound to the profit and honour of the city of Genoa\\". This has led modern historians to suggest that Grillo's original orders had been to sail to the Levant. However, his actions up to that point show that he was already committed to an alternative plan aiming at striking the Venetian convoy, and the story of the Messinese ship may simply have been invented as a justification for deviating from the orders he had pledged to follow. As with the Venetian claims of Genoese deception and espionage, Dotson writes, it is impossible to determine the truth from the \\"many layers of possible deception present in the sources\\", especially as these are \\"unclear on the exact timing and even the sequence of events, in an operation in which timing was very important\\". Battle The commander of the convoy, Duaro, appears to have sailed slowly, confident of the lack of any threat to his ships. On 14 August, off the island of Saseno (today Sazan Island, Albania), at the narrowest part of the Strait of Otranto, Grillo encountered the Venetian convoy. The Venetians were in a difficult situation: the large taride, loaded with goods, and with at most 40 armed soldiers each, were no match for the swift and agile Genoese galleys, each with a crew of about 150 men ( rowers and 50 marines). The medieval sources report that Duaro and his crews were initially dismissive of the Genoese: the Venetians threw chickens in front of the Genoese vessels and shouted \\"fight with them!\\". The fighting began in the evening and culminated around midnight. The Venetian ships clustered around the Roccafortis, which towered above the other vessels like a castle. As the Genoese pressed their attack on the smaller Venetian vessels, Duaro eventually ordered their crews to abandon them and gather on the Roccafortis, bringing along what valuable goods they could carry. The Venetian sources claim that the departing crews sunk many of their taride, while the Genoese, who approached with caution, wary of a trap, captured the rest. The Annali Genovesi on the other hand report that all lighter ships were captured, apart from a nave, which was sunk, and a tarida which was lost to fire. On the other hand, the Roccafortis held firm. The Genoese promised to safeguard the lives of its crew if they surrendered, but Duaro refused, claiming that the ship was laden with gold, and inviting the Genoese to come and take it. The Genoese then launched a fireship against it, but the Venetians managed to drive it off. In the end, a favourable wind allowed the Roccafortis to escape pursuit and find refuge in the southern Adriatic port of Ragusa. Impact The battle was a major success for the Genoese. The captured merchandise and ships were valued at more than 100,000 Genoese pounds, an enormous sum for the period, of which 30,000 went into the Genoese treasury through the sale of the plunder; while conversely the Venetians were deprived altogether of all commerce with the east for that year. Equally important was the blow to Venetian prestige and morale, for which Duaro found himself confronted with accusations of cowardice. As the Italian naval historian Camillo Manfroni points out, however, his was a grossly unequal fight; and ultimately Duaro preferred to save the lives of his fleet's crews‚Äîand the not inconsiderable treasures carried by the Roccafortis‚Äîto a doomed stand to the end. The wrath of Doge Reniero Zeno was somewhat lessened when he learned that no Venetians were made prisoners during the evacuation of the taride, and that Duaro was not well assisted by his subaltern officers. As Dotson writes, \\"This operation [...] reflects both the strengths and weaknesses of the Genoese and Venetian capacity for war in the mid-thirteenth century. It also illustrates the part played by intelligence-gathering, rumor, and disinformation in a campaign.\\" Aftermath In the meantime, Barozzi was pressing on eastwards, searching in vain for Grillo's fleet. Arriving at Tyre on 2 September, he encountered a Genoese merchantman, the Oliva, carrying 11,000 bezants worth of silk, in the harbour. With the Genoese fleet nowhere in sight, Barozzi resolved to seize the ship, despite the warnings of the city's lord, Philip of Montfort, a Genoese ally, that he would confiscate double the amount in Venetian properties if they did so. Barozzi did not hesitate long: he not only captured the Oliva, but also began a siege of Tyre itself, in the hopes of depriving Genoa of access to this, the second-most important port city of the Levant. The Venetians had to interrupt the siege after a few days, however, when news of the events at Saseno reached them. Instead, Barozzi hurried to Acre to escort the previous year's returning convoy back to Venice. Important as it was, the Genoese success at Saseno proved ephemeral: in 1266, the Venetians captured the entire Genoese battle fleet at the Battle of Trapani. Meanwhile, Michael VIII Palaiologos grew increasingly dissatisfied with the poor Genoese performance against the Venetians, and distrustful of their loyalty. In 1264, he expelled the Genoese from Constantinople and sought a rapprochement with Venice that culminated in a provisional non-aggression pact in 1265, although it was not finally ratified until three years later. The stalemate between Venice and Genoa continued, until in 1269 King Louis IX of France, keen to use the Venetian and Genoese fleets in his planned Eighth Crusade, coerced both to sign a five-year-truce in the Treaty of Cremona.

The school was founded in 1965 and closed in 2006. In 1989, EHA received national attention after two incidents involving alleged racial discrimination. History =Founding= In 1965, Holmes county public schools began to desegregate with limited busing programs. As a result, parents began withdrawing their children from public schools and sending them to all white private schools like EHA. In 1969 the trend accelerated when the Supreme Court issued a ruling ordering Holmes county public schools to desegregate immediately. In the 1969‚Äì1970 school year, almost every white teacher in Holmes County left the public school system to rejoin their students at segregated private schools. EHA's first board chair, Frank Drake, formerly taught at Inverness High School. =Tuition grants= For the 1968‚Äì69 school year, EHA charged $300 () for tuition. A tuition grant program administered by the State of Mississippi provided vouchers of up to $240, covering 80% of that amount. For the 1965‚Äì1966 school year, the grant program provided 95% of EHA‚Äôs tuition revenue. In 1969, in the case Coffey v. State Educational Finance Commission, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi ruled that since, in the court's opinion, EHA would refuse to admit qualified black students, the tuition grant program violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.Coffey v. State Educational Finance Commission 296 F. Supp. 1389 (S.D. Miss. 1969) =Loss of tax exempt status= The Internal Revenue Service revoked EHA's tax exempt status in 1970 after the IRS concluded that the school had failed to adopt racially non- discriminatory admissions policies. The IRS announcement noted that since EHA had been unwilling to conform with IRS requirements for nondiscriminatory admissions, donations to the school would lose their tax deductible status. As of 1982, EHA had not regained its tax exempt status. =1989 football incidents= There were two racial controversies associated with EHA during the 1989 Mississippi Private School Association football season. Exclusion of black broadcaster In the first controversy, EHA was reported to have asked an opposing school not to bring a black radio broadcaster to a game played at EHA. The broadcaster, Glen Collins, was a former NFL player who was working as a color commentator for WJXN in Jackson. The Jackson Academy athletic director, Bobby West was reported to have told Collins' colleague Lee Adams that \\"Glen was not welcome up there [at East Holmes] because he was black.\\" Adams said that he was incredulous that Collins was asked not to attend the August 25 game, stating Collins was \\"best person for the job\\" regardless of his race and that he \\"thought we were past all that other stuff.\\" Collins told the AP that after the incident, he made excuses not to broadcast other games at all white private academies. Offer to forfeit against integrated opponent In the second controversy, EHA offered to forfeit a football game because the other school had a black player. The other school, Heritage Academy, was the first school in the MPSA north central AA conference to add a black player when it recruited running back Scott Fuller to transfer schools during the 1989 football season. EHA claimed that its offer to forfeit the game was due to injuries, not race. The EHA headmaster told the Clarion Ledger \\"If we don't [play] it won't be because of that black.\\" Many rejected EHA's claims as untruthful, with the Heritage Academy coach calling the claims \\"a bunch of bull.\\" The Clarion Ledger reported that the decision to forfeit had been made by the whole board of directors. The headmaster, Frank Drake, declined to comment on motivation of the board's decision, saying that \\"sometimes decisions are nobody's business.\\" The president of the MPSA said that if EHA violated the association's anti- discrimination policy, EHA would be expelled. In a 1990 retrospective interview, EHA board member Joe McClellan acknowledged that race was the motivation for the offer to forfeit. McClellan claimed that Heritage Academy \\"has a reputation for recruiting blacks\\", so the EHA board felt that it \\"had to say something.\\" McClellan explained that the EHA board did not \\"hate blacks\\" and commented that \\"integration has only been around a few decades. Were our forefathers so wrong?\\" After EHA announced its decision, seven players and two board members resigned. One former player told the Chicago Tribune that the EHA coach had told the team \\"we didn't want to play Heritage because we didn't want to advertise that blacks could come to the school.\\" One of the board members who left, Frank Janous, told the Carion-Ledger \\"I just felt a bad decision was being made, and I didn't want to be part of it.\\" EHA ultimately reconsidered its decision to forfeit and visited Heritage Academy to play the game on October 20, 1989. EHA lost the game 7‚Äì0. Aftermath Many parents withdrew their children from EHA after the 1989 controversies. A total of 28 students withdrew from EHA and enrolled in Kosciusko public schools. Additional students transferred to other private schools. One parent who withdrew his son told the Clarion-Ledger that, as a result of the incident, he was no longer willing \\"to support the school with our kids and our money\\". The Clarion-Ledger also reported that faculty and staff at EHA who opposed the board's decision were forced to leave their positions. Several months after the football game, Scott Fuller played in a basketball game for Heritage Academy at EHA. Fuller told the Clarion-Ledger that he felt awkward when EHA students shouted \\"there he is\\" when Fuller entered the gym. Fuller added that EHA headmaster Frank Drake stared him down during the game, but the two did not exchange words. If the two did talk, Fuller wanted to tell Drake that he hoped Drake \\"had changed his views about blacks and whites\\". =Closure= EHA shut down in May 2006. Many students transferred to Central Holmes Academy or Winona Academy. Campus After its founding in 1965, EHA initially operated out of temporary quarters provided by the Durant Baptist Church. Around 1969, EHA's high school moved into a former public school for black students.

The tale is set in Greece and is about a man known as Dmitri of the Evil Eye. Dmitri's wife was murdered and his daughter abducted many years before the story begins. Dmitri's friend Katusthius Ziani enlists him to help recover his rightful inheritance, and during their journey they abduct a boy whom Dmitri discovers to be his grandson.  Summary  The tale centres on a man known as Dmitri of the Evil Eye, an Arnaoot (Albanian) Klepht leader who lives in Yannina, Greece. Many years before the story begins, Dmitri's Sciote wife was murdered and his daughter kidnapped by Mainote pirates while he is away from home. Dmitri searched for his daughter for three years before giving up hope, gaining a scar across his eyebrow and cheek in a battle with Mainotes. This scar and his grief and anger transformed his features and character such that he is rumoured to possess the power of the Evil Eye. When the story begins, Dmitri's friend and sworn brother, the Moreot Katusthius Ziani visits Dmitri to ask for help recovering his father's fortune. Katusthius had joined a crew of Barbary corsairs after they boarded his merchant ship, and after leaving them had wandered through Europe before returning to his father's home in Corinth. When he returned, he discovered that his father, thinking him dead, had willed his fortune to another son, Cyril. Cyril shared the inheritance, but Katusthius is determined to regain it all, and asks Dmitri to help. Katusthius visits Cyril and his wife, Zella, and asks them to accompany him to Naples to see him off on a long journey. While they are away from home, Dmitri kidnaps their three-year-old son, Constans. Cyril is enraged when he finds out and goes in search of his son. He discovers that Dmitri is the man responsible, and that Katusthius is involved as well. Cyril enlists his father-in-law, Camaraz, a Mainote leader, to help him find Constans, and leaves Zella at home mourning her son and fearing for her husband's life. Dmitri becomes attached to and protective of Constans during their travels, but Katusthius plots against the child. One night, while Dmitri is sleeping, Katusthius takes the boy, conceals him in a nearby Caloyer monastery, and recruits Sagori villagers to ostensibly protect the boy and monastery from Dmitri. Dmitri and his band attack the monastery and retrieve Constans. As they escape through the mountains, they encounter Katusthius and his party, as well as Cyril and Camaraz, who have been tracking the kidnappers. Camaraz declares himself a Mainote and the grandfather of the abducted boy, and Dmitri's feelings of affection for Constans transform instantly to revulsion for Mainotes. He threatens to kill Constans, but before he is able to, Camaraz explains that Constans is not a Mainote, as his mother was a Sciote, kidnapped as a young girl. Dmitri realizes that Constans is the son of his lost daughter, Zella, and returns home with Cyril to be reunited with her and his newfound grandson.  Publication History  \\"The Evil Eye\\" was first published in The Keepsake for 1830, a British literary annual, credited to \\"The Author of Frankenstein\\". It was accompanied by an illustration entitled Zella, which was painted by Henry Corbould and engraved by Charles Heath. It has since appeared in one collection of Shelley's work and of supernatural stories, but is not widely read or studied.  Themes and Influences  \\"The Evil Eye\\" is one of several tales Shelley published in The Keepsake. Others include \\"Ferdinando Eboli\\" (1829), \\"Transformation\\" (1831), \\"The Invisible Girl\\" (1832), \\"The Dream\\" (1833), and \\"The Mortal Immortal\\" (1834). \\"The Evil Eye\\" employs many motifs common in Gothic fiction, including abduction, revenge, and the curse of the Evil Eye. The tale displays the aesthetics of Romantic Orientalism, and can be categorized as an Oriental tale alongside William Beckford's novel Vathek (1786), Lord Byron's poems The Giaour and Childe Harold's Pilgrimage (1812‚Äì1818), Thomas Hope's Anastasius (1819), and Prosper M√©rim√©e's La Guzla (1827). Unlike other Gothic tales by Shelley, such as \\"Transformation\\" and \\"The Mortal Immortal,\\" and her Gothic novel Frankenstein, \\"The Evil Eye\\" does not involve supernatural phenomena. The tale may have been inspired by La Guzla, which Shelley reviewed in 1829. \\"The Evil Eye\\" is a variation on the Gothic fragment, a form exemplified by Anna Letitia Aiken's \\"Sir Bertrand: A Fragment\\" (1773). Although it is now categorized as a short story, that form was not named until the 1880s in Britain. It is more accurately classified as a Gothic tale, a story about an experience of the strange or supernatural, often narrated in the first or third person.

It originates from the Hamburg Kolonialinstitut (colonial institute) founded in 1908. Within the Hamburg Institute of International Economics (HWWA) it turned into a unique public press archives. In 2007 it was absorbed by the German National Library of Economics (ZBW) and merged with the Wirtschaftsarchiv (economics archive) of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW), founded in 1914. Article collection was discontinued by end of 2005, but the archive is still open to the public.Kultur bewahren, pp. 107-109  History  After a few years, the \\"Zentralstelle\\" (central office) of the Kolonialinstitut was transformed from a free information center for colonial issues into a comprehensive archive of global political and economic topics, which primarily supported Hamburg's merchants. After the breakdown of the German colonial empire in World War I, the renaming to \\"Hamburgisches Welt-Wirtschafts-Archiv\\" in 1919 sealed this reorientation.Leveknecht 1998, p. 13, 15, 21. The staff of HWWA reflected its importance and grew from 54 in 1919 to 183 permanent or temporary employees in 1958 - a state that seems to have remained largely stable until the late 1990s.Leveknecht 1998, p. 19, 43, 63. Founded shortly before the outbreak of the First World War, the Kiel Economic Archive and its library were closely linked to the scientific work of the IfW, which focused on global economic contexts and their practical use.Buchholtz, p. 17. In 1966, the library of the IfW was given the function of a central library for economics by the German Research Foundation (DFG) in the Federal Republic of Germany, and in 1993, the department was renamed accordingly. During the First and the Second World War both archives were intensively involved in the foreign and wartime planning of the empire and the Nazi state. Starting in 1936, \\"Confidential Reports from the Foreign Press\\" provided selected economic leaders and Nazi departments with \\"largely unfiltered information and comments on economic issues from foreign media and represented a unique feature in Nazi media policy\\".Buchholtz, p. 24. By acting with the informal means of a foreign cultural and information policy supplementing the military expansion policy, HWWA and IfW dedicated their services to the Nazi regime.Buchholtz, p. 27. In 1996, a closer cooperation between HWWA and ZBW / Wirtschaftsarchiv began with the aim of merging the two archives. Since the beginning of 2001, the articles were indexed according to a new common classification system and made retrievable via a reference database, \\"EconPress\\".Till the end of 2005, 120,000 individually recorded and tagged articles were added each year (Leveknecht 2006, p. 3). The \\"EconPress\\" database seems to have completely disappeared from the Following a recommendation from the evaluation within the Leibniz Association in 2003, the current press documentation was finished at the end of 2005 and the materials were frozen at the level reached.Leveknecht, p. 5. The existence of the HWWA ended in 2007 with the integration of its press documentation and library into the ZBW as a newly formed foundation under public law. Today, the press archive belongs to the (research) infrastructures of the Leibniz Association.  Areas of collection and extent  By 1919 at the latest, the Hamburg archive collected \\"press clippings on a global scale\\".te Heesen, translated from the German edition, p. 21. The archive was subdivided in four sections: * The Sacharchiv (topics archive) with subject matter \\"from all countries, subcontinents and the whole world\\".Leveknecht 2006, p. 4. For the individual countries and regions, which constituted the primary order criterion, up to 1200 individual topics were recorded. Further special folders were created for individual events or questions \\"such as the Boer War, the issue of slavery or the Suez Canal\\".Research, Travel, Exploration, p. 130. Since the late 1990s, collecting had focused on \\"domestic and international economic issues (business, economics, economic policy, markets, industries, innovations)\\".Leveknecht 2006, p. 5. * The Warenarchiv (wares archive) with national and international raw materials, semi-finished and finished products. The product names are subdivided into approximately 980 upper and 3400 sub-terms.Research, Travel, Exploration, p. 94. Here, countries and regions represent the secondary order criterion. * The Firmenarchiv (companies archive) with business reports, anniversary publications and press clippings of c. 36,000 (according to other figures: c. 70,000 Hans-Eckart Scharrer (HWWA President), in: Leveknecht 1998, p. 63.) domestic and foreign companies. In addition, material on several hundred institutions and international organizations, universities and research institutes has been collected.Leveknecht 2006, p. 6, as well as * The Personenarchiv (persons archive) with dossiers of about 16,000 people from business, politics, science, culture and society. More than 1400 sources have been evaluated for the press archives. Their broad international distribution provides access to the history of political thought and receptive history of the covered topics. Occasionally, the collected publications go back as far as 1826.Huck/Wannags, p. 443. While the persons archive was only available in paper form until its partial digitization, the holdings of the topics, wares and companies archives have been saved every ten years on roll film or microfiche since the 1960s and then the paper clippings were pulped.Huck/Wannags, p. 433. The holdings of the Kiel Wirtschaftsarchiv are less comprehensively documented. They are subdivided into a topics archive, which mainly served the research and teaching of the IfW and which is microfilmed up to 1945, a personal archive, only in paper form, which also contains publications of these persons, and a home archive with publications about the IfW itself, also in paper. The archive on corporate bodies, which in 1958 comprised 4800 companies and more than 5600 German and international scientific and cultural societies and institutions, political parties and trade associations.Muziol, p. 172 and 176 and represented \\"one of the most complete collections for twentieth-century business history\\"Fischer, p. 419 is not mentioned any more in the archive's profile. The \\"war archive\\" of 1914‚Äì1918, which comprehended one million clippings, was destroyed by a bomb strike in 1942. For 1958, when six scientific experts and more than 30 employees in total were collecting and organizing the material, the total extent of the archive was estimated as more than three million,Muziol, p. 170 and 172 for 1993 as more than ten million.Seusing, p. 186 By the Pressemappe 20. Jahrhundert application, parts of the holdings of both archives are now accessible on the web.  Partial digitization and the Pressemappe 20. Jahrhundert application  From 2004 to 2007, the German Research Foundation funded a project to digitize parts of the archives. These covered the materials from the beginnings up to 1949 (the constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany). The paper clippings from the folders of the persons archive were scanned, and metadata (folder and document ID as well as page number, occasionally also source, publication date, author and title) recorded by project staff. Optical character recognition could not be applied due to the partially used Fraktur scripts, the constantly changing fonts (as well as languages) in the sequence of the articles, and the partly poor quality of the clippings.Buchholtz, p. 54. However, the approximately 5,500 person folders created before 1949 are fully accessible online. Digitized parts of the topics archive: Besides Germany (still incomplete) and particularly Hamburg (complete), the former German colonies, Western Europe as a whole, countries of the Middle East, Japan, Argentina, and the (Ant)Arctic. The roll film parts of the archive (up to 1960) have also been digitized. As neither the folders nor the documents on these films were separated in a machine-readable fashion, such formal elements could not be automatically derived. Instead, the pages had to be \\"sliced\\" with a specially developed \\"Slider\\" software, assembled into documents and folders, and given metadata.Huck/Wannags, p. 436 ff. Only a small part of this labor-intensive process was finished at the end of the project in 2007. It is continued until today, so that new folders are continually made available via the web application \\"Pressemappe 20. Jahrhundert\\", which was created within the framework of the project.Reports on the progress of the ongoing work are published on the Of the c. 11,000 company folders on digitized roll film, currently about 7,500 are accessible online.Joachim Neubert: 20th Century Press Archives JSON-LD dump for CdV 2018 Rhein-Main. Persons and companies, data set, 2018, http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1471430 For the topics and wares archives, the share of online folders still seems to be significantly lower.Figures on this are missing on the project page. An indication is provided by the BEACON files published there, which refer to 1095 dossiers for the country / topic archive and 232 for the wares archive, as identified by their GND ID (as of 2017-11-18). The persons are alphabetically indexed by name, while the companies are accessible by name, geographically by their headquarters and via industry lists. The topics can be accessed via the topics hierarchy and country system as well as through a search for subject and geographical GND keywords and via a world map with geolocations. The limitation to 1949 was made for capacity reasons, and due to intellectual property rights restrictions. Numerous individual articles within the dossiers are subject to blocking notices if the death of the author or, in the case of anonymous or pseudonymous works, the date of publication is less than 70 years ago. With a moving wall more and more documents should be released over time.Huck/Wannags, p. 438, as well as Jeude, pp. 28-32, cf. also How many of the about 5.7 million documents digitized in the context of the project are currently accessible to the scientific and general public on the web is not known.

It was announced on August 9, 2017, with initial availability the next day and with rollout to all U.S. users by the end of the month. Facebook Watch's original video content is produced for the company by partners, who earn 55% of advertising revenue (Facebook keeps 45%). Facebook Watch offers personalized recommendations for videos to watch, as well as categorized content bundles depending on factors such as popularity and social media engagement. Facebook wants both short-form and long-form entertainment on its platform, and has a reported total of $1 billion in budget for content through 2018. Facebook monetizes videos through mid-roll advertising breaks and plans to test pre- roll advertising in 2018. On August 30, 2018, Facebook Watch became available internationally to all users of the social network worldwide. As of June 2019, Facebook reported that 140 million people per day spent at least one minute in Watch, and 720 million viewers per month. History On August 9, 2017, Facebook Inc. announced that it would be launching its own video on demand service. During the same announcement it was stated that the new service would be called Facebook Watch. The video on demand service was launched for a small group of U.S. users a day later, with a rollout to all U.S. users beginning at the end of August. In May and June 2018, Facebook launched around six news programs from partners including BuzzFeed, Vox, CNN, and Fox News. These programs, developed by Facebook's head of news partnerships Campbell Brown, reportedly had an overall budget of US$90 million. On July 25, 2018, Facebook gave their first presentation ever at the annual Television Critics Association's annual summer press tour. During Facebook's allotted time, Fidji Simo, the Vice President of Product for Video, and Ricky Van Veen, the Head of Global Creative Strategy, showcased Facebook's continuing ramp-up of original programming on Facebook Watch. On August 30, 2018, Facebook Watch became available internationally to all users of the social network worldwide. Budgets and monetization =Content budgets= For short-form videos, Facebook originally had a budget of roughly $10,000-$40,000 per episode, though renewal contracts have placed the budget in the $50,000-$70,000 range. Long-form TV-length series have budgets between $250,000 to over $1 million. The Wall Street Journal reported in September 2017 that the company was willing to spend up to $1 billion on original video content through 2018. = Monetization = Facebook keeps 45% of ad-break revenue for content shown on Facebook Watch, while its content-producing partners receive 55% of ad revenue. In January 2017, the company announced that it would be adding \\"mid- roll\\" advertising to its videos, in which ads will appear in videos after users have watched at least 20 seconds. In December 2017, Ad Age reported that Facebook was lifting a long-time ban on \\"pre-roll\\" ads, an advertising format that shows promotional content before users start the actual video. Facebook had resisted using pre-roll ads because the format has a \\"reputation for annoying viewers\\" who want to get to the desired content, though the report stated that the company would nevertheless try the format. Steve Ellis, CEO of WhoSay, a social influencer marketing company, told Ad Age that \\"YouTube already established that people will sit through and tolerate pre-roll\\" and that \\"It's proven that they haven't sent consumers fleeing, so it makes sense that Facebook would pursue a similar strategy as it builds out its original content experience\\". Two weeks after Ad Ages report, Facebook updated its blog to note that the pre-roll advertising format would begin testing in 2018, and that there were going to be changes to mid-roll ads; specifically, they cannot appear until a minute into a video, and are only available for videos that run for at least three minutes, as opposed to the original rule of appearing after 20 seconds on videos potentially as short as 90 seconds. Content In addition to original programming, Facebook Watch also distributes content licensed from other companies. On November 30, 2018, it was announced that the streaming service had struck a deal with 20th Century Fox Television to stream television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Firefly. Reception Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak estimates that \\"Facebook Watch\\" can bring in $565 million in revenue to Facebook by the end of 2018. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill has predicted that the service has the potential to earn $12 billion in revenue by 2022.

Completed in 1937, the tower is part of Rockefeller Center, which was built in the Art Deco style. History Rockefeller Center occupies three blocks in Midtown Manhattan bounded by Fifth and Sixth Avenues to the east and west, between 48th Street to the south and 51st Street to the north. By 1936, most of the complex had been completed. Rockefeller Center Inc. only needed to develop three empty plots in the middle of the complex's northern and southern blocks. The site of 1 Rockefeller Plaza, located on the southern block, was being used as a parking lot, and at the time, it was the city's largest parking facility. In 1936, Time Inc. expressed interest in moving out of their Chrysler Building offices into a larger headquarters, having just launched their Life magazine. Rockefeller Center's managers persuaded Time to move to a proposed skyscraper on part of the southern empty lot, located on Rockefeller Plaza between 48th and 49th Streets, by promising the company seven floors and a penthouse; space to expand; a 20-year lease; and the right to name the building after themselves. Excavation for a new building at 1 Rockefeller Plaza, numbered 9 Rockefeller Plaza at the time, started in June 1936. The original plans stipulated a 32-story building, but the height was increased to 36 stories with the use of setbacks on the 48th Street elevation. The number of setbacks was minimized, which increased rentable space within the building, and the original blueprints for the plot were retained for the Time & Life Building. The steelwork for that building was laid on September 25, 1936, and was complete by November 28, forty-three working days later. The Time & Life Building, as it was known, opened on April 1, 1937, along with the final block of Rockefeller Plaza abutting the building, between 48th and 49th Streets. Time moved into the building in 1938. Time Inc's lease stipulated that nothing else could be constructed within of the Time & Life Building's uppermost floors. The original tenants included the Girl Scouts of the USA and Museum of Modern Art, but Time Inc. itself did not move into the building for another year after its completion. In 1960, the building was renamed for General Dynamics after Time Inc. had moved into 1271 Avenue of the Americas, the new Time-Life Building located three blocks away. The tower was renamed for its street address after General Dynamics moved to St. Louis in 1971. Description The 36-story tower at 1 Rockefeller Plaza, on the east side of the plaza between 48th and 49th Streets, is the original Time‚ÄìLife Building. The tower contains a 10th-floor setback on the 48th Street side, while its 49th Street side is actually set back from the street, rising as a slab. The Rockefeller Plaza side is almost a slab except for the 10th-story setback, and the eastern side connects to 600 Fifth Avenue via a seven-story annex. Its north-south axis aligns with the since-modified alignment of the International Building. One Rockefeller's artwork was designed for a generic tenant, with a general life theme. Artwork The artwork included Lawrie's bas-relief of Pegasus, robed figure, and eagle above the entrance, signifying human progress. In addition, Attilio Piccirilli's \\"Joy of Life\\" limestone relief, depicts a hedonistic Dionysus enjoying wine. The entrance portal is decorated with C. Paul Jennewein's limestone carvings of industry and agriculture. Carl Milles created a three-part wood-and-silver sculpture near the top of the lobby's western wall. It is called \\"M√§nniskan och Naturen\\" or \\"Man and Nature\\" and was created from 1938 to 1941. The right-hand carving depicts a wooden faun pushing nature away, while the left-side carving consists of a wooden nymph in the foliage, and the central carving depicts a wooden man on horseback listening to a metal Mexican nightingale that every hour on the opens its beak and sings a recording of a Mexican Nightingale from the Bronx Zoo.

Completed in 1940, the building is part of Rockefeller Center, and was built in the Art Deco style. History Rockefeller Center occupies three blocks in Midtown Manhattan bounded by Fifth and Sixth Avenues to the east and west, between 48th Street to the south and 51st Street to the north. By 1936, most of the complex had been completed. Rockefeller Center Inc. only needed to develop three empty plots in the middle of the complex's northern and southern blocks. The final plot on the southernmost block needed to be developed, and several tenants were being considered. In spring 1937, the center's managers approached the Dutch government for a possible 16-story \\"Holland House\\" on the eastern part of the plot. A six-floor parking garage would fill the hard-to-lease space on the lowest three floors of the building, as well as three basement floors. The Dutch government did not enter the agreement because of troubles domestically, most notably Hitler's invasion of the Netherlands. However, Rockefeller Center's managers were already in negotiations with Eastern Air Lines, whose CEO Eddie Rickenbacker would sign a lease in June 1940. The Dutch government did move into temporary offices in the International Building. Excavation started in October 1938, and the building was topped out by April 1939. Upon the Eastern Air Lines Building's completion, the Dutch government moved its offices-in-exile into the new building. The new structure was unique for its glass-wrapped lower facade and the lack of art over its doorways. Although the complex itself was finished in November 1939, the Eastern Air Lines Building was not officially complete until its dedication in October 1940. Description Today 10 Rockefeller Plaza is located on the west side of Rockefeller Plaza between 48th and 49th Streets. Its planning name was the Holland House, but the Dutch government did not sign on, so the building became the Eastern Air Lines Building instead. 10 Rockefeller was built as a 16-story slab, basically a miniature version of 1 Rockefeller Plaza across the street. Unlike the other buildings, there are no exterior reliefs or carvings on 10 Rockefeller Center. Diverging from the standard style of the complex, it contained two glass-faced 4-story retail wings to its north and south, with a rounded moderne corner at Rockefeller Plaza and 48th Street. Instead of a limestone entrance portal, 10 Rockefeller had a glass portal with a large mural on the lobby wall behind it. The design of the glass-faced retail space was considered \\"baffling\\" to retailers, and the space remained unused until at least the 1950s. As stipulated in the original plans, the building also contains a six-floor parking garage with 800 spots, accessible from 48th Street. Garages in New York City office buildings had been prohibited under the 1916 zoning law until it was amended in 1935. As a result, 10 Rockefeller contained New York City's first garage in an office building, and the design of 10 Rockefeller's garage was unique for the area. There is a lounge for car owners, a recreational area for chauffeurs, and bronze firepoles for attendants to access the garage quickly. A rooftop garden exists on the third floor, above the garage and retail space. There are two more tiers of gardens on the fifth and sixth floors. Notable modern tenants include the Today Show studios,and since 2005, the Nintendo New York store. 10 Rockefeller Plaza contains a single crimson, gold-and-silver leaf mural, The History of Transportation, commissioned by Dean Cornwell in 1946.

Completed in 1938, the building is part of Rockefeller Center, which was built in the Art Deco style. History Rockefeller Center occupies three blocks in Midtown Manhattan bounded by Fifth and Sixth Avenues to the east and west, between 48th Street to the south and 51st Street to the north. By 1936, most of the complex had been completed. Rockefeller Center Inc. only needed to develop three empty plots in the middle of the complex's northern and southern blocks. Rockefeller Center's executives went into talks with the Associated Press for a building on the northern empty lot, which was occupied by the complex's truck delivery ramp. The lot had been reserved for the Metropolitan Opera house, but the managers could not wait to develop the lot anymore, so in 1937, the opera plans were formally scrapped. The lot had also been planned as a hotel site, but this was also deemed economically infeasible. In January 1938, Associated Press agreed to rent the fourth through seventh floors of the structure, with the building to be named for the company. Construction of the steelwork started in April 1938, and after 29 working days, it was topped out by June. The Associated Press moved into the structure in December. The building, located at 50 Rockefeller Plaza, was built to the outer limits of its lot without any setbacks or rooftop gardens; it rose only 15 floors because of the 1916 zoning law and the paucity of other tenants. The presence of Associated Press and Time Inc. expanded Rockefeller Center's scope from strictly a radio- communications complex to a hub of both radio and print media. In 1938, the Associated Press opened the Guild, a newsreel theater, along the curve of the truck ramp below the building. Description News by Isamu Noguchi 50 Rockefeller Plaza is located on the west side of Rockefeller Plaza between 50th and 51st Streets. The only building in the Center built to the outer limits of its lot line, the 15-story building took its shape from Associated Press's need for a single, undivided, loft-like newsroom as large as the lot could accommodate‚Äînamely, a blocky structure with no setbacks. At one point, of transmission wire were embedded in conduits on the building's fourth floor. The complex's truck ramp descends under the building from 50th Street, while the rear of the building is located next to the Radio City Music Hall. The building also contained the Guild Theater, a 450-seat newsreel theater, from 1938 to 1999. Isamu Noguchi's stainless steel panel, News, is located above the building's entrance. His work, which depicts the various forms of communications used by journalists in the 1930s, honors the different occupations in the news industry. It is one of Noguchi's last abstract works as well as the only stainless steel work he ever commissioned.

He taught at the music department of the Technical University of Dortmund. He researched and edited works by Fanny Hensel-Mendelssohn. He founded and conducted a chamber choir at the university and recorded with them, including operas for the Kurt Weill Foundation. After his retirement from teaching, he cofounded and organised a concert series at St. Peter, Syburg, including organ concerts and vocal concerts with notable performers.  Career  Born in Oberhausen, Gundlach studied first to be an elementary teacher at the P√§dagogische Hochschule (PH, School of education) in Braunschweig. He studied to be a teacher of higher education in Hanover, at both the Musikhochschule and the Technical University. He studied musicology in Kiel and at the Cologne University, promoted to Ph.D. in 1969. Gundlach first taught at the PH Flensburg, then from 1963 at the PH Dortmund. In 1980, he was appointed professor of music and its pedagogy (\\"Musik und ihre Didaktik\\") at the Technical University of Dortmund. He published several books on his topics, including studies of Fanny Hensel-Mendelssohn. In 1977, he founded the chamber choir of the university (Kammerchor der Universit√§t Dortmund) and conducted it until 2005, although he retired from teaching in 1994. He conducted the choir of the university from 1976 to 1995. In 1985, he founded an international week of music, Campus cantat (The campus sings), which he directed to 2001. Gundlach recorded choral music with the Kammerchor, including works by Hugo Distler und Fanny Hensel-Mendelssohn. He conducted a recording of Distler's Choralpassion, Op. 7, for soloists and five-part choir a cappella, with Peter Kooy as vox Christi, Wilfried Jochens as the Evangelist, and Gerrit Miehlke as Pilate. He recorded in 1990 two operas by Kurt Weill for the Kurt Weill Foundation, with soloists, the Kammerchor and orchestra, Der Jasager, written in 1930, and Down in the Valley, written in 1948. He initiated and cofounded a concert series of bimonthly concerts at the Romanesque church St. Peter in , the Syburger Sonntagsmusiken. The series began in 1998 with the inauguration of a new organ. Performers have included Heinz Wunderlich, a pupil of Karl Straube and a professor in Hamburg, the composer and organist Wolfgang Stockmeier, professor of organ and improvisation at the Musikhochschule K√∂ln, and Hatto St√§nder who taught organ at the Dortmund University. Among the vocal groups were, besides the Kammerchor, the Alsfelder Vokalensemble, conducted by Wolfgang Helbich, and the Kettwiger Bach-Ensemble, conducted by Wolfgang Kl√§sener. The 100th concert was given in 2012. Gundlach organised an Offenes Kantatensingen (Open cantata singing) as part of the concert series, regularly on the Second Sunday in Advent, calling volunteer singers to an all-day rehearsal the day before, and a rehearsal with soloists and orchestra, mostly students of the university. He moderated the event in the candle-lit church, conducting all who gathered in singing Advent songs and rounds, and conducting the cantata with the prepared project group. After a start in 1998 with varied choral music for Christmas, the programming was more and more ambitious. In 1999, Dieterich Buxtehude's Magnificat was performed, among others. In 2000 the first Bach cantata was tried, Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland, BWV 61, followed in 2001 by Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben, BWV 147, and in 2002 by Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, BWV 140. In 2003, the ensemble performed a Magnificat in G major by Georg Philipp Telemann, while in 2004, the prepared cantata was Part VI from Bach's Christmas Oratorio, Fallt mit Danken. In 2005, Gundlach conducted the Oratorio de No√´l by Camille Saint-Sa√´ns. The choice of 2006 was Part I from Handel's Messiah, covering Advent and Christmas. In 2007 Gundlach selected Part III from the Christmas Oratorio, beginning \\"Herrscher des Himmels, erh√∂re das Lallen\\", in 2008 when the series celebrated its 10th anniversary, Part I, beginning \\"Jauchzet, frohlocket!\\". Gundlach then passed the cantata series to younger musicians, but conducted one more Bach cantata in the 100th concert on 6 May 2012, the congratulatory cantata BWV 207, however with a new text written for the occasion by Martin Geck.

The album was released in November 1990 by Tusk Music. It went gold upon release in South Africa, and has since reached platinum status. The title track, \\"Hometalk\\", was released as a single, followed by \\"Island Boy\\", \\"Taken for a Moment\\", and \\"Moments Away\\". The band recorded music videos for all four singles. One song, \\"We Are Waiting\\", was released several months early, in advance of Nelson Mandela's release from prison. Hometalk was the first South African album to receive the Ampex Golden Reel Award. Songs The song \\"We Are Waiting\\" was released several months before the album's debut, since it was written in anticipation of Nelson Mandela's release from Victor Verster Prison. When Mandela was freed on 12 February 1990, after 27 years of imprisonment, the US news program Nightline used \\"We Are Waiting\\" as a musical score for their coverage of the event. The number of US viewers who watched the broadcast was estimated at 30 million. When the band were invited to perform at Mandela's inauguration concert, they played another selection from Hometalk: \\"Love Is (The Hardest Part)\\". One album track, \\"Shoo-roop!\\", was not written by Mango Groove band members, but by Dolly Rathebe and Johannes Monaheng of the Elite Swingsters jazz band. =Singles= When the album was released in November 1990, the title track, \\"Hometalk\\", was released as a single, followed by \\"Island Boy\\", \\"Taken for a Moment\\", and \\"Moments Away\\". \\"Island Boy\\" is a pop song that was issued as a CD single in France (on Carr√®re Records' Cent Pour Cent imprint). \\"Taken for a Moment\\" is a ballad written in memory of the anthropologist and anti-apartheid activist David Webster. Dr. Webster was assassinated in 1989 by agents of the Civil Cooperation Bureau, a state-sponsored death squad. \\"Moments Away\\" was also a tribute of sorts. In the song, Alan Lazar plays a grand piano in which thumbtacks are attached to the hammers. The thumbtacks give the notes a \\"metallic timbre\\", but damage the piano. The band did all of this in imitation of Abdullah Ibrahim's 1974 recording of \\"Mannenberg\\", a Cape jazz song that has come to be regarded as a classic. Ibrahim had used thumbtacks when recording the song in order to evoke the sound of marabi music. The band recorded music videos for all four singles. The dances in \\"Hometalk\\" were choreographed by Wendy Ramokgadi, who previously choreographed the video for \\"Special Star\\". The video for \\"Island Boy\\" was shot on location in Mozambique. \\"Moments Away\\" later became the title track of Mango Groove's 2006 compilation album, Moments Away: Love Songs and Lullabies, 1990‚Äì2006. The album's notes describe \\"Moments Away\\" as the band's \\"biggest-selling love song\\". Production Hometalk was arranged by band member Alan Lazar and bandleader John Leyden. It was produced and mixed by Alan Lazar, John Leyden, and Chris Birkett. Recording took place at AudioLab in Johannesburg, and mixing was done at Eden Studios in London. Since the album was recorded and mixed on Ampex tape, its sales figures qualified it for an Ampex Golden Reel Award, making Mango Groove the first South African band to receive this particular accolade. Releases In South Africa, Tusk Music released Hometalk on CD, cassette, and LP record. In France, Hometalk was released on cassette (by Cent Pour Cent) and golden CD (by Totem Records) in 1991. These French releases included two previously released singles as bonus tracks: \\"Special Star\\" and \\"Dance Some More\\". The Gallo Record Company reissued the album (without bonus tracks) in a broader digital distribution in 2013. It has been marketed through Amazon Music, eMusic, iTunes, Rhapsody, and Spotify. In 2011, Gallo reissued Hometalk with the band's 1995 album Eat a Mango on one CD. The reissue was part of the label's \\"Two on One Collection\\" CD series. Although \\"We Are Waiting\\" is the final song on other editions of Hometalk, the \\"Two on One Collection\\" lists it as the first song on Eat a Mango.

It has a single tubular, bright green leaf and up to twenty two scented, green, brownish-red or purplish flowers. It is a very rare orchid with only a few hundred plants known. Description Prasophyllum keltonii is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single bright green, tube- shaped leaf long and wide. The free part of the leaf is long. Between twelve and twenty two flowers are arranged along a flowering stem long. The flowers are green, brownish-red or purplish and as with others in the genus, are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped to lance-shaped, about long, wide, turns downwards and has three darker stripes. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, about wide and free from each other. The petals are linear to lance- shaped, long, about wide and curve forwards near their tips. The labellum is lance-shaped to egg-shaped, about long, wide and turns upwards near its middle. The edges of the labellum are smooth and there is a broad, green to reddish callus in its centre. Flowering occurs in December and January. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum keltonii was first formally described in 2007 by David Jones and the description was published in The Orchadian from a specimen collected on McPhersons Plain in the Bago State Forest near Blowering. The specific epithet (keltonii) honours Peter Branwhite, one of the collectors of the type specimen. Distribution and habitat Branwhite's leek orchid grows with tall sphagnum moss and heath on a small treeless area known as McPhersons Plain near Cabramurra and Talbingo. The entire population grows in an area of less than and has declined from about four hundred plants since 2004. Conservation Prasophyllum Branwhite is listed as \\"Critically Endangered\\" under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act and the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. The main threats to the population are logging, changes in drainage patterns due to dam water storage, grazing by livestock, feral horses and pigs and weed invasion. The population is not in a conservation reserve.

She is most known for her time as the Ecuadorian Minister of Industries and Productivity and as the President of the Andean Parliament. She is Ecuador's former Ambassador to Qatar and current Ambassador to the United States. Biography Ivonne Baki was born on 23 February 1951 in Guayaquil to Fred Juez and Anan Abuchacra, both Lebanese immigrants to Ecuador. At 17, Ivonne married Lebanese millionaire Sami A-Baki, took his surname, and moved to his residence in Lebanon. The couple would be present in the country for much of the Lebanese Civil War. In 1982, Ivonne Baki moved to Paris and studied the arts at the Sorbonne. Later, she would study Public administration at Harvard University. =Beginnings in diplomacy= Baki began her political career as Ecuador's consul to Beirut in 1981.

In 1995, Baki and Roger Fisher received a request from the President Sixto Dur√°n Ball√©n to participate in the peace deliberations of the Cenepa War between Ecuador and Peru. Both accepted and agreed to cooperate, moving to Ecuador and were involved in the process that led to the Brasilia Presidential Act in 1998. In the same year, Jamil Mahuad, the new president of Ecuador, appointed Baki the Ecuadorian Ambassador to the United States of America, the first woman appointed to this office. In this position, Baki played a key role in achieving favorable trade agreements with the United States. In 2000, Baki founded the Galapagos Conservancy, after an oil spill took place in the Galapagos Islands, with the aid of American tycoon Donald Trump, whom she had met and befriended during a diplomatic trip to the United States.

While holding this office, Baki also managed to have Miss Universe 2004 hosted in Quito, Ecuador thanks to her friendship to Donald Trump, owner of the company that organized the event. In response to criticism levied at her over the high cost of the event, Baki said that the money was \\"an investment\\" and not an expense and that it would provide an \\"excellent opportunity to promote the country [Ecuador] abroad.\\" Another landmark of Baki's running of the Ministry was her attempt to establish a Free Trade Agreement with the United States, which was widely criticized by indigenous groups, who held demonstrations against Baki's ministry. =Later political activity= During the , Baki was elected to the Andean Parliament to represent the Patriotic Society Party. Once her membership of the Andean Parliament began, the Ecuadorian delegation proposed as a candidate for the Presidency of the Parliament for the 2007-2009 term. At the beginning of 2010, she was elected head of the team negotiating Yasun√≠-ITT Initiative by President Rafael Correa with the objective of raising 3,600 million dollars from the international community in exchange for the cessation of exploiting of approximately 846 million barrels of oil underneath Yasuni National Park. The project could not achieve these goals and was dissolved mid-2013. In February 2020, Baki was confirmed as Ambassador to the United States by President Len√≠n Moreno.

She was an early member of the Freedom Quilting Bee, which was an alternative economic organization created in 1966 to raise the socio-economic status of African- American communities in Alabama. She was also among the group of citizens who accompanied Martin Luther King Jr. on his 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. Mingo is a recipient of a 2015 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the highest honor in the folk and traditional arts in the United States. Early life Lucy Young was born in 1931 in Rehoboth, Alabama, a settlement near Gee's Bend to Ethel and Earl Young. Her nickname is \\"Toot\\". Her father was a sharecropper who also worked as a longshoreman in Mobile, Alabama which required him to be away from the family for long periods of time. Lucy and her siblings worked the fields growing corn, peas, potatoes, peanuts, and cotton to earn a meager living. Mingo went to Boykin elementary school, and at age 13 was sent to the Allen Institute in Mobile. After graduation from Allen, she moved back to Boykin and married David Mingo in 1949, at age 17. She and David had ten children, seven of them daughters but only one of her children (Polly) quilts. She is a fourth-generation quilter, with her mother, grandmother, and older close family friend all inspiring her and teaching her their art. She pieced her first quilt top at the age of fourteen. Career =Non-quilt making career= After she married, Mingo returned to farm labor and continued there until 1965. She then worked as a cook in the school cafeteria for ten years, but was laid off. She worked in Selma for a year, and then got a job as a homemaking educator for the Auburn University extension service for more than 20 years, teaching people how to cook, can, and freeze. She retired at age 69, after her mother became ill. Like many women in Gee's Bend, Mingo squeezed in quilting time after completing work at her other jobs. =Freedom Quilting Bee= Mingo was a founding member of the Freedom Quilting Bee (FQB), which began during the Civil Rights Movement. Their quilts were sold across the United States and brought much-needed money back to the Gee's Bend economy. Mingo had a reputation within the Bee as an excellent teacher, and one of her specialties was the \\"Chestnut Bud\\" which had a deep-seated history in Wilcox County, Alabama, but at the time Mingo claimed she was the only member of the FQB who knew how to make that quilt, so she taught her fellow members the details of that pattern. Two of Mingo's black-and-white Chestnut Buds were sold via the Bee to Vogue magazine editor Diana Vreeland. Estelle Witherspoon, the Bee's first manager, and Mingo led a twelve-woman team that produced a Chestnut Bud quilt, sofa cover, and drapes for CBS chairman William S. Paley and his wife. The women of the FQB were very aware of and many were active in the civil rights movement. Members of the FQB heard Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. speak in Gee's Bend in 1965 and many of them, including Mingo, were inspired to register to vote as a result. Mingo says she \\"marched in Montgomery and over the Pettus Bridge, but I wasn't in the one with John Lewis\\" and she avoided getting arrested because she had children. Mingo was considered \\"one of Gee's Bend's leading spokespersons during the civil rights era\\". The Bee was founded in part to provide employment to women who had who lost work when they took a stand for civil rights and registered to vote, which happened to Lucy Mingo. At one point, the Bee was the largest employer in the town of Rehoboth. The Freedom Quilting Bee's numbers declined in the 1990s due to an aging membership, plus weather damage to their community space. After the death of the last original board member, the Bee officially closed in 2012. =Gee's Bend Collective= Lucy Mingo made this pieced quilt in 1979. It includes a nine-patch center block surrounded by pieced strips. Collection of Bill Volckening, Portland, Oregon. Mingo quilted as a member of both the Freedom Quilting Bee and the Gee's Bend Collective, which had similar economic missions and some overlapping membership. The FQB, however, required the quilters to use standardized patterns to make the quilts more marketable, while the Collective members are allowed artistic freedom in the design and execution of their quilts. The work and artistry of the Collective gained national attention in 2002 when an exhibition of seventy of the women's quilts was assembled by folk art collector and art historian William Arnett and his Tinwood Alliance in conjunction with The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. The exhibition called \\"The Quilts of Gee's Bend\\" traveled to ten other museums around the country, including the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. An article about the Whitney exhibition in The New York Times brought even more national attention to the artistry of the Gee's Bend quilts, when the reviewer wrote that the quilts \\"turn out to be some of the most miraculous works of modern art America has produced\\". Mingo's contribution to the 2002 exhibition was in the area of \\"work clothes\\" turned into quilts. In her early years, Mingo frequently used old denim and cotton shirts worn during field work as material for her quilts. Mingo said about these quilts, \\"You know, we had hard times. We worked in the fields, we picked cotton, and sometimes we had it and sometimes we didn't. And so you look at your quilt and you say 'This is some of the old clothes I wore in the fields. I wore them out, but they still doing good.' \\" The attention and praise the Gee's Bend Collective members received from the art world as the 2002 exhibit toured the country surprised them. Mingo said \\"When we see our quilts in museums, we're just amazed. We never thought quilts would get there.\\" Mingo also said about the effect of the exhibition: \\"Yes, they are about history because quilts have been here all the time. But in another way, these quilts just became history because before they were hidden in the closets and on the bed mattresses. When you take them out, they become history. Until quilts made history, people weren't paying attention. Now, everyone wants to see your quilts; they want to know what you're making.\\" Following the success of the 2002 exhibition, Mingo was often hired as leading quiltmaking instructor at events across the USA. In addition, the prices for her quilts increased dramatically. Before working at the Freedom Quilting Bee, Mingo's quilts would sell for about $5.00. A 2008 quilting identification and price book includes a Mingo quilt made in 2004 valued at \\"more than $5,000\\". In 2006, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston and the Tinwood Alliance mounted a second exhibition titled \\"Gee's Bend: The Architecture of the Quilt\\" that included works by Mingo. That exhibition's itinerary included eight museums throughout the United States. Mingo was one of two Gee's Bend Collective quilt makers featured in a 2014 episode titled \\"Industry\\" of the PBS television series Craft in America. In 2014, it was reported that because she is over 80 years old, Mingo rarely makes new quilts anymore. But her quilts are still included in exhibitions, including the 2017 Outsider Art Fair held in New York City. In May 2018, Mingo traveled to New York City to attend the opening of an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art titled \\"History Refused to Die: Highlights from the Souls Grown Deep Foundation\\" that included some of Mingo's quilts, as well as others from the Gee's Bend Collective. Exhibitions Mingo's quilts have been included in museum and gallery exhibitions throughout the USA, including: * The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (2002, 2006) * Whitney Museum of American Art (2003) * Mobile Museum of Art (2003) * Milwaukee Art Museum (2004) * Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.

Karl Hug spent his childhood and youth in St. Gallen. After school, he had to start a mechanical engineering apprenticeship in a printing company, which he broke off after a year. He earned his living as a construction worker and attended evening classes at the business school, first in the structural engineering, later in the decorative department. From 1920, Hug worked as a typographer in Geneva. In 1923, Hug moved to Berlin and attended evening classes in the private school of Arthur Lewin-Funcke, and at Lessing University. He studied with local teachers K√§the Kollwitz and Max Liebermann, who supported him with letters of recommendation, but was also influenced by Karl Walser and Lovis Corinth. With his partner Amrey Balsiger (1909-1999), the daughter of Menton Moser, Hug first went to Arles for some time in 1927, where he worked with Max Hunziker. Charles Hug and Amrey Balsiger split in 1931 after she met the German-Dutch painter Herbert Fiedler (1891-1962), whom she married in 1938. In 1932, Hug made the acquaintance of the St. Gallen violinist Ren√©e-Elisabeth Walz (1909-1979) and conducted an intensive correspondence with her. In 1934, he returned to Switzerland. After the marriage in the same year, they took up residence in winter in Zurich and in summer in Greifenstein-Staad near Rorschach, an old farmhouse with a large garden and a view of Lake Constance. He continued to participate in international exhibitions with his drawings, portraits and landscape paintings (Brussels, Tokyo, Paris), but now focused in his work on fruit and flower still lifes and landscapes and devoted himself increasingly to his drawing and illustrations. For his illustrations to Conrad Ferdinand Meyer's The Shot of the Pulpit and Gottfried Keller's The Governor of Greifensee he received in 1938 and 1939 awards from the Gottfried Keller and the C. F. Meyer Foundation. References * Alfred Sch√ºler: Charles Hug. Maler, Zeichner, Illustrator. Z√ºrich 1959.

The first, a 13-minute segment that is simply titled \\"Net Neutrality\\", was delivered on June 1, 2014, as part of the fifth episode of Last Week Tonight's first season. The second, which runs 19 minutes and is titled \\"Net Neutrality II\\", was delivered on May 7, 2017, as part of the eleventh episode of the fourth season, and the 100th episode overall. During these two segments, comedian John Oliver discusses the respective threats to net neutrality at the time of each segment. The first episode was about how, under the administration of President Barack Obama, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was considering two options for net neutrality in early 2014. The FCC proposed permitting fast and slow broadband lanes, which would compromise net neutrality, but was also considering reclassifying broadband as a telecommunication service, which would preserve net neutrality. After a surge of comments supporting net neutrality that were inspired by Oliver's episode, the FCC voted to reclassify broadband as a utility in 2015. The second episode dealt with a resurgence of the same problem, except under the administration of Donald Trump. The FCC was proposing to eliminate the 2015 rules that classified broadband as a utility, thereby allowing the implementation of slow and fast lanes. Despite another surge of comments following the second episode, the FCC proceeded with its plans to eliminate the 2015 regulations. Context John Oliver (pictured in 2016), the host of Last Week Tonight =Last Week Tonight= Prior to the 2014 segment about net neutrality, Last Week Tonight had only aired four episodes, all of which were complex investigations of obscure problems. Bloomberg News called Last Week Tonight's approach \\"hardly a tried-and-true recipe for TV success.\\" The late New York Times columnist David Carr commented that prior to the net neutrality segment, he thought Oliver's comedic style would \\"never work.\\" =2014 fast- lane proposal= In January 2014, the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia provided a ruling in the case of Verizon v. FCC,Full text of decision and correction. United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia (2014). in which Verizon Communications, an internet service provider (ISP), sued the Federal Communications Commission for violating its rights under the United States Constitution. The FCC had passed the Open Internet Order in 2010 following the outcome of Comcast Corp. v. FCC, where it was found that the FCC could not censure Comcast's interference with their customers' peer-to-peer traffic. The order was meant as a further step toward ensuring net neutrality in the sense that ISPs could not block or discriminate against lawfully operated websites, apps, or web services. The ruling in Verizon v. FCC was that the FCC could not enforce net neutrality rules as long as service providers were not identified as \\"common carriers\\". However, the FCC was given permission to regulate broadband and craft more specific rules that stop short of identifying service providers as common carriers. The ruling created a dispute as to whether net neutrality could be guaranteed under existing law, or if reclassification of ISPs was needed to ensure net neutrality. FCC chair Tom Wheeler stated that the FCC had the authority under Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to regulate ISPs. However, others including President Barack Obama supported reclassifying ISPs using the Communications Act of 1934. Their reclassification would move ISPs from being a general provision, which fell under the act's Title I, to a common carrier, which fell under the act's Title II. Critics of Section 706 pointed out that the section has no clear mandate to guarantee equal access to content provided over the internet, while subsection 202(a) of the Communications Act stated that common carriers cannot \\"make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges, practices, classifications, regulations, facilities, or services.\\" Advocates of net neutrality generally supported reclassifying ISPs under Title II, while FCC leadership and ISPs generally opposed such reclassification. The FCC stated that if they reclassified ISPs as common carriers, the commission would selectively enforce Title II, so that only sections relating to broadband would apply to ISPs. In April 2014, the FCC proposed a set of new regulations that, among other things, would allow for ISPs to levy charges on websites in exchange for faster connection speeds. The \\"fast lane\\", as the proposal was called, would prioritize that website's internet connection over those of other websites that did not pay, although the ISP could not outright block web users from accessing websites that did not pay for \\"fast lanes\\". In addition, in enacting these \\"fast lanes\\", ISPs had to divulge whether they were promoting the content of sponsors or affiliates. This was at least the FCC's third attempt to create internet fast lanes. By May 2014, the FCC was considering two options: permitting fast and slow broadband lanes, thereby compromising net neutrality; or reclassifying broadband as a telecommunication service, thereby preserving net neutrality. Draft plans for the \\"fast-lane\\" option were approved, with three Democratic FCC commissioners voting to have the public review the proposal, and two Republican communications voting against public feedback. The FCC's proposal was heavily criticized for its two-tier, preferential system, whose very core would go against the principle of net neutrality. The director of the Common Cause organization's Media and Democracy Reform Initiative compared the FCC proposal to \\"toll roads\\" that \\"represent Washington at its worst.\\" A reporter for The Verge wrote that these regulations \\"would destroy net neutrality\\" precisely because it slowed down traffic. In response, Wheeler said that any statements saying that the proposed regulations would restrict the open Internet were \\"flat out wrong\\".' \\"Net Neutrality\\" =Description= Oliver delivered his first 13-minute segment about net neutrality on June 1, 2014, as part of the day's main segment. He introduces the subject by praising \\"the internet, a.k.a. the electronic cat database,\\" and noting how easy it is to buy merchandise such as coyote urine on the internet compared to if these items were bought in person. Oliver uses the coyote-urine analogy as a way to segue into a discussion of Wheeler's net-neutrality proposal. He pans \\"net neutrality\\" as a seemingly uninteresting topic, saying that videotaped FCC meetings about the issue might seem very boring \\"even by C-SPAN standards.\\" Oliver then introduces the concept of net neutrality as something where all data is given the same priority regardless of its creator. He states that the Internet's relative equality, up to that point, had allowed startup companies to supersede bigger companies. Oliver introduces the topic of how \\"the Internet is not broken, and the FCC is taking steps to fix that\\". The segment then displays some news clippings and broadcasts that explain the FCC's priority-lane proposal. Oliver returns onto the segment, and he protests vehemently against the proposed rules, jokingly stating that the rules would ensure \\"my startup video streaming service, Nutflix, a one-stop resource for videos of men getting hit in the nuts\\", would not be able to compete with larger companies like Netflix. He then takes a more serious approach, stating that the proposal would allow large ISPs such as Verizon and Comcast to buy the \\"fast-lane\\" data more easily compared to smaller ISPs with fewer funds. Oliver rebuts a telecommunication lawyer's claim that it would be a \\"fast-lane-versus-hyperspeed-lane\\" contrast, stating that the proposed rules were more comparable to Olympic gold medalist sprinter Usain Bolt versus \\"Usain bolted to an anchor\\". The comedian refutes telecommunications companies' claims that they would not slow down other web traffic to get more internet users to subscribe to their services instead. Oliver points out an example in which Comcast slowed down Netflix download speeds in 2013 and 2014 unless Netflix paid Comcast a smooth-streaming fee. From October 2013 until Netflix finally agreed to pay in February 2014, Netflix download speeds for Comcast customers had slowed up to 25%, compared to on other ISPs where download speeds had consistently increased in the same time period. Oliver compared it to a \\"mob shakedown.\\" The comedian then says that the fight to keep net neutrality is so important that pro-net-neutrality activists are on the same side as corporations like Google, Netflix, Amazon, and Facebook, an alliance which Oliver describes as very unlikely. He compares this to Lex Luthor knocking on his nemesis Superman's apartment door for an offer to team up to \\"get rid of the asshole in apartment 3B\\". Oliver then says that the only entities that would benefit from the rule change were the cable companies who are lobbying Congress, including Comcast, who is the second- largest congressional lobbyist. Oliver says that President Barack Obama had been seen golfing with Comcast's CEO Brian Roberts, as well as invited Roberts to a fundraiser dinner. He also states that Obama's nomination of Tom Wheeler, a former cable and wireless lobbyist, for the FCC Chairman position was \\"the equivalent of needing a babysitter and hiring a dingo\\". Oliver quotes a 2010 FCC report on broadband, which said that 96% of Americans have at most two wireless providers to choose from. The segment then displays a clip of Roberts saying that if Comcast were to merge with another major ISP like Time Warner, there would be no reduction in competition. Oliver responds, \\"you could not be describing a monopoly more clearly if you were wearing a metal top hat\\", a player token used in the game Monopoly. Then the segment shows a graphic of Ookla Speed Test that shows a list of countries, sorted by their average broadband speed. The U.S., ranking 31st on the list, had an average speed slower than Estonia, a country Oliver described as \\"still worried about Shrek attacks\\". Oliver goes on to point out that Comcast and Time Warner had the lowest customer satisfaction ratings of any corporation in America, according to the quarterly American Customer Satisfaction Index that was released two weeks prior to the segment. He says that ISPs were not being truthful when they said they are committed to an open internet, and that representatives for the ISPs describe their plans in such a boring way that it goes unnoticed by many Americans. Oliver quips, \\"The cable companies have figured out the great truth of America: if you want to do something evil, put it inside something boring\\", comparing it to Apple Inc. putting Mein Kampf inside their user agreement. At the end of the segment, Oliver displays the web address for the FCC's comment section. He delivers an exhortation toward \\"the Internet commenters out there\\", saying that \\"we need you to get out there and, for once in your life, focus your indiscriminate rage in a useful direction. Seize your moment, my lovely trolls, turn on caps lock, and fly my pretties! Fly! Fly!\\" =Aftermath= The segment received 800,000 views on YouTube in two days, while the TV broadcast saw over 1 million views. The segment was thought to spur over 45,000 comments on the FCC's electronic filing page about the net neutrality proposal. The FCC also received an extra 300,000 comments in an email inbox designated specifically for the proposal. By comparison, the proposal with the second highest number of comments had 2,000 such responses. The day after the episode, the FCC comment page experienced a surge in traffic. Shortly after the first segment aired, the FCC website crashed, and Last Week Tonight viewers noted that the website's commenting function was not working. A spokeswoman for the FCC said that it was \\"unclear if the high volume was directly related to the John Oliver segment\\". Bloomberg News wrote that even though the segment was only a small part of the net-neutrality debate, as compared to the electronic mailing lists convincing tens of millions of people to vote against the proposed rules, it \\"gave a bump to a political movement\\" and ultimately helped to reverse the FCC's position in regards to net neutrality. Soraya Nadia McDonald of The Washington Post stated that Oliver \\"may be just the firebrand activist we‚Äôre looking for\\" in regards to the net-neutrality debate. Terrance F. Ross of The Atlantic wrote, \\"John Oliver‚Äôs segment on net neutrality this past June perfectly summed up what his HBO show Last Week Tonight is so good at: transcending apathy.\\" Not all commentators had positive reviews of the segment. Jon Healey of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"Oliver misled his audience badly on a couple of key points\\", saying that the federal courts would not allow the FCC to unfairly discriminate between different forms of web traffic; that large ISPs would not need the new rules to implement a speed-tiered system; and that Wheeler had left open the possibility of outlawing the ISPs' promotion of certain websites for a fee. He stated that in the case of Netflix versus Comcast, the problem had been a third-party transit provider who had argued with Comcast over the price and amount of data that the ISP would provide. Robert McMillan of Wired said that \\"complaints about a fast-lane don't make much sense\\" because large websites like Google and Facebook already benefited from \\"fast lanes\\", albeit in the form of large servers embedded in the ISPs' Internet exchange points. He wrote that instead of advocating against a change that had already occurred, internet users should look for ways to increase ISPs' competitiveness. Chairman Wheeler himself responded to the segment, praising it as \\"creative\\" but saying \\"I am not a dingo\\". Wheeler said, \\"I think that it represents the high level of interest that exists in the topic in the country, and that's good.\\" However, he also stated that the segment did not talk about the FCC's plan to reinstate the open-internet protections that had been halted in an appeals court earlier that year. The University of Delaware's Center for Political Communication conducted a study in which it concluded that viewers of late-night shows were generally more informed about the net neutrality issue than regular cable news viewers. The study found that knowledge of the net neutrality debate was highest among Last Week Tonight viewers and lowest among Fox News viewers. According to the study, 74% of Last Week Tonight watchers heard about net neutrality, of which 29% heard \\"a lot\\" about the issue, compared to 52% of Fox News watchers, only 7% of which heard \\"a lot\\". The \\"Net Neutrality\\" segment increased Last Week Tonight's viewership to approximately 4 million per episode by the end of the first season, and contributed to its popularity in U.S. late-night television. In November 2014, after the season had ended, David Carr of The New York Times wrote that the show had become \\"a smash\\" since the segment first aired. Carr stated that the \\"Net Neutrality\\" segment had helped convince FCC leadership to support net neutrality. = Effect on net-neutrality debate = In September 2014, the Pew Research Center found that the FCC filing page received 3,076 comments the week before the June 1 segment, and that there were another 79,838 comments posted the week immediately afterward. Google searches for the term \\"net neutrality\\" rose in popularity that week compared to the previous and following weeks. Two interns analyzing the data for the Pew Research Center wrote that the sudden rise in the number of comments on the FCC net-neutrality page could not be attributed to cable or printed news media, since these outlets' coverage of net neutrality was more infrequent than in previous weeks. Ultimately, less than 1 percent of the proposal's total 800,000 comments could be classified as \\"clearly opposed to net neutrality\\", with the majority either indicating support, taking no particular position, or being irrelevant comments. The Verge later requested that the FCC publish emails related to the Last Week Tonight episode under the Freedom of Information Act. Of the emails that were released, most were positively critical of the video. In one exchange, a CBS executive sent a link to FCC employees, who joked about \\"Nutflix\\" and Usain Bolt. One of the FCC employees said, \\"We had a good laugh about it. The cable companies... not so much.\\" When one reporter satirically asked if Chairman Wheeler commented on the \\"dingo\\" quip, an FCC spokesperson said \\"Hey John, no, no comment on that\\" with a smiley emoticon. This prompted Oliver to create a subsequent video parodying the FCC's response. A Twitter policy spokesman said, \\"We all agreed that John Oliver‚Äôs brilliant net neutrality segment explained a very complex policy issue in a simple, compelling way that had a wider reach than many expensive advocacy campaigns.\\" On February 26, 2015, the FCC voted to apply the \\"common carrier\\" designation of the Communications Act of 1934 and Section 706 of the Telecommunications act of 1996 to the internet. The decision was driven partly because most Americans only had one high-speed internet provider available in their areas. On the same day, the FCC also voted to preempt state laws in North Carolina and Tennessee that limited the ability of local governments in those states to provide broadband services to potential customers outside of their service areas. While the latter ruling affected only those two states, the FCC indicated that the agency would make similar rulings if it received petitions from localities in other states. In response to ISPs and opponents, FCC Chairman Wheeler said, \\"This is no more a plan to regulate the Internet than the First Amendment is a plan to regulate free speech. They both stand for the same concept.\\" On March 12, 2015, the FCC released the specific details of its new net neutrality rules, which included prohibiting content blocking, slower connections to websites, and \\"fast and slow lanes\\". It was thought that Oliver's segment had a major role in the decision, which was the opposite of the FCC's original \\"lane\\" proposal. On April 13, 2015, the final rule was published.  \\"Net Neutrality II\\"  = Updates since \\"Net Neutrality\\" = After Donald Trump won the United States presidential election of 2016, he appointed Republican FCC board member Ajit V. Pai as chairman of the FCC. Pai announced proposals to scrap Title II shortly after his appointment on the grounds that higher regulation of the internet led to decreased business. This marked a turnaround from the previous FCC's position under Chairman Wheeler. In May 2017, the FCC successfully voted to proceed with a plan to remove the net neutrality rules enacted under the Obama administration. Like the 2014 proposal vote, this vote was also partisan, with one Democratic board member opposing the removal and two Republicans supporting it. =Description= Oliver starts by introducing the Internet, \\"the repository of all human knowledge and videos of goats singing Taylor Swift songs\\". He describes his previous \\"Net Neutrality I\\" episode and its aftermath. Afterward, Oliver describes the reason for his second episode: the Trump administration is rolling back Obama-era regulations, including Wheeler's net-neutrality rules. The comedian says, \\"I genuinely would not be surprised if one night Trump went on TV just to tell us that he personally killed every [Thanksgiving] turkey Obama ever pardoned\\". Oliver shows a clip of YouTube personality Tay Zonday, who summarizes the concept of net neutrality. Zonday says that under net neutrality laws, ISPs have to treat all web traffic the same, and as an example, he says that an ISP cannot favor one search engine by slowing down traffic that uses other search engines. After the clip ends, Oliver paraphrases what Zonday just said: that under the concept of net neutrality, ISPs cannot impact or restrict people's online actions, and big companies cannot prevent competition from small companies. Oliver says that in the case of the latter, \\"Ancestry.com could easily crush my new site JustTellMeIfImRelatedToANazi.com. It's like ancestry.com except you get to skip all the bullshit.\\" He then notes that major ISPs like Charter, Cox, and Comcast have all published statements that endorsed \\"a free and open internet\\", and that Verizon even made a video explaining that the change would \\"put the open Internet rules in an enforceable way on a different legal footing\\". The comedian next explains Titles I and II of the Communications Act of 1934; the ruling provided by Comcast v. FCC; and Pai's appointment by President Trump. Oliver says that based on this context, Verizon's bid for a \\"different legal footing\\" was akin to \\"O. J. Simpson asking why you won't let him hold any of your samurai swords\\". He continues that the new FCC chairman's promise that the current rules' \\"days were numbered\\" and his vow to \\"take a weed whacker\\" to the current rules was like \\"serial killer talk\\". Pai's easygoing attitude, casual quotations of The Big Lebowski on his Twitter account, and affinity for his large Reese's-branded coffee mug made him personable, and according to Oliver, even more dangerous. Oliver says that Pai is a former lawyer for Verizon who has said that \\"we were not living in some digital dystopia before the partisan imposition of a massive plan hatched in Washington saved all of us\\", to which the comedian adds, \\"Except for Pizza Rat\\". Oliver then takes a serious tone, saying that reclassification of ISPs was the only way to regulate them, and points out that Pai had erroneously said that there is no evidence of throttling by cable companies. Oliver refutes Pai's statement with a Bloomberg News article about how Verizon, AT&T;, and T-Mobile had blocked their respective subscribers from accessing Google Wallet on their phones because it competed with their Isis Mobile Wallet service. The comedian subsequently lampoons the wallet's name because of its resemblance to the name of the terror group ISIS. The comedian says that Pai has also proposed \\"laughably lacking\\" alternatives to net neutrality. One alternative stipulated that ISPs simply include a voluntary statement in their terms of service indicating that they would not throttle or block content, which Oliver says would \\"make net neutrality as binding as a proposal on The Bachelor\\". Pai's other rationales for reclassifying ISPs was that the new rules already resulted in decreased investment in broadband networks. Brian Schatz, a Democratic U.S. Senator representing Hawaii and the ranking member of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet, said that Pai's claim of decreased investment was untrue. Oliver then quotes a 2014 phone call from Francis J. Shammo, the chief financial officer of Verizon, in which the latter says that the new net- neutrality rules did not affect Verizon's business. Oliver says, \\"that doesn't really sound like net neutrality was jeopardizing investment at all\\". He states that Pai's actions to eliminate Title II are like \\"pouring [a gallon of coffee] into your hands and trusting that you don't get burnt\\". At this point, Oliver holds up a Reese's mug that is even larger than Pai's mug and says, \\"I'm drinking the blood of smaller mugs\\". The ISPs' position on the net neutrality issue is that protections could be retained by an Act of Congress, but Oliver says that he does not trust Congress to go through. He also expresses distrust of President Trump, who had claimed that Obama's net- neutrality protections would \\"target conservative media\\", when in fact, that could only be achieved by the opposite scenario: a lack of net-neutrality protections. At the end of the segment, Oliver urges viewers to go to GoFCCYourself.com, a website redirecting to the specific FCC proposal. He says, \\"Every Internet group needs to come together like you successfully did three years ago ‚Ä¶ gamers; YouTube celebrities; Instagram models; Tom from MySpace, if you‚Äôre still alive. We need all of you. You cannot say you are too busy when 540,000 of you commented on Beyonce‚Äôs pregnancy announcement\\", referencing a viral post from the singer Beyonc√© from earlier that year. =Effects and reception= Oliver's segment was thought to have caused viewers to submit an extra 150,000 comments on the net neutrality proposal. As with the previous \\"Net Neutrality\\" segment, the FCC site was thought to have crashed temporarily as a result of the surge in commenting. However, the FCC later stated that the site was unavailable due to distributed denial-of- service (DDoS) attacks that were unrelated to the Oliver segments. HBO also denied having initiated the DDoS attacks. Engadget noted that apart from the specific page about the net-neutrality proposal, the rest of the FCC site was working at normal speeds. Several Congressional Democrats doubted that the cause of the FCC website's outage was a DDoS attack, and they called on the FCC to investigate the issue. BuzzFeed journalist Kevin Collier filed a lawsuit against the FCC after it refused to publish data related to the outage under the Freedom of Information Act. In response to the segment, Ajit Pai made a video in which he read and responded to mean tweets about himself in the style of a Jimmy Kimmel Live! \\"Mean Tweets\\" segment. Pai read several tweets that mentioned several things that John Oliver had talked about in \\"Net Neutrality II\\", such as The Big Lebowski quotes and the Reese's mug, but he did not read any tweets referring to net neutrality itself. Gizmodo criticized Pai's video, saying that he refused to debate Oliver's points and instead \\"addresses a bunch of Twitter eggs\\", anonymous user profiles, \\"with the implication that anyone who opposes his cash grab for corporations is a moron\\".  Web exclusive  In a segment posted only on YouTube the following week, Oliver talks about an update at the FCC. He describes how gofccyourself.com started trending on Twitter after the Net Neutrality II segment aired. Ultimately, the FCC website got 1.6 million extra comments as a result of the segment. Oliver shows a video of a news anchor describing this fact while using an image of Stephen Colbert, another comedian. Oliver then reads off a comment from a person claiming to be from the International Space Station who complained about his porn website access being interrupted, to which he responds, \\"There is no one up there who has any use for porn, and I'll tell you why: they are way too busy space fucking\\". He also noted that several comments were using fake names like Homer Simpson, Barack Obama, and Michael Jackson, then said that \\"Michael Jackson\\" is a very common name, although one commenter writing under that name had listed an address of \\"420 Buthole st\\"‚Äîa reference to cannabis culture and posteriors. Oliver describes that some media had doubts about this net-neutrality drive, with one news anchor alleging that there were 128,000 spambot comments with fake names. He then says that some of the comments were racist, saying, \\"Let me just say, if any of those came from anyone who watches this show, stop it! Writing racist things on the Internet is not how you win the net neutrality debate, it's how you win the presidency.\\" The comedian concludes by calling on viewers to refrain from adding any more comments, since the FCC stopped taking any comments a week before their May 18 vote on the issue.  Commenting period closes and FCC votes  As a result of the surge in comments, the public commenting period was extended by two weeks to August 30. A poll in mid-August found that 60% of Americans supported the rules while 17% opposed them. The ratio of support was consistent for voters from both the Democratic and Republican parties. By the time the commenting period closed, the FCC had received 22 million comments on the issue, which was the highest number of comments for any FCC proposal to date. However, this included over 1 million comments from a spambot, most of which were made in support of the proposal to repeal net neutrality. One estimate placed the total number of fake comments in excess of 7 million, using variations from seven email templates. The fake emails used duplicate and temporary email addresses, submitted under names such as \\"The Internet\\", and at one point, 500,000 comments were sent in the span of a single second. Because the legitimacy of so many of the comments was questioned, the FCC considered disregarding every comment. Following this revelation, Pai refused to investigate the fake comments, so New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman set up his own webpage to help the public determine whether their names and information were used in any of the fake comments. Despite the 22 million comments, the FCC announced plans to repeal net neutrality anyway in November 2017. After this announcement, several news media made references to the John Oliver segments about the issue. On December 14, 2017, the FCC voted in favor of repealing these policies.

She was killed in her home by armed intruders on 16 January 2008. Although she had been issued a diplomatic passport as the daughter of Kabila, after her death the government claimed that she was unrelated to the former president. Life Aim√©e Kabila Mulengela was said to be the natural daughter of President Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila and Za√Øna Kibangula. She would thus be the half-sister of President Joseph Kabila. She was born on 24 July 1976 in Kipushi, Democratic Republic of Congo. Laurent- D√©sir√© Kabila was assassinated on 16 January 2001 in Kinshasa and was succeeded ten days later by his son Joseph Kabila. Aim√©e's brother, Etienne Taratibu Kabila, left Kinshasa secretly in January 2002 for South Africa. He wanted to take Aim√©e with him but that was not possible since she was the mother of four children. On 25 February 2005 she married Alain Mayemba Bamba, alias \\"Barracuda\\". A diplomatic passport was issued to her in the name \\"Aim√©e Kabila\\" on 7 April 2005. On 30 December 2005 Aim√©e Kabila Mulengela was taken from her home in Kinshasa/Ngaliema by Special Services police and soldiers of the Military Detection of Anti-Homeland Activities (DEMIIAP) and detained for 52 days. A report by the non-governmental organization \\"La voix des sans-voix\\" (VSV: Voice of the Voiceless) said her ex-husband Alain Mayemba Bamba ordered the detention, which would have been supported by Sifa Mahanya, mother of President Joseph Kabila. The day after her detention her six month old baby was taken from her in her cell, and disappeared. She was released on 24 February 2006. Property taken at the time of her arrest, including money, jewelry, passports and other documents, were not returned. Assassination Aim√©e Kabila Mulengela was killed in front of her children at her home in Mont Ngafula, Kinshasa, in the early morning of 16 January 2008. The morning before the killing the armed men in Congolese National Police uniforms who were posted to guard the home were removed. She appears to have been tortured before being shot by two armed men who broke into her home. According to her children and neighbors several jeeps were parked outside the house at the time, and the body at the morgue showed stab wounds and marks of torture. She was survived by six children: Astrida Kabila (aged 15), Branly Kabila (13), Petit-Aim√© Kabila (10), Mechak Kabila (8), Victor Kabila (6) and Victorine Aline Bamba (3). Before her murder Aim√©e Kabila had been asking questions about the future of the property of Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila and the identity of his heirs. She said she felt threatened and asked for United Nations protection in the DRC. Aim√©e's brother, Etienne Taratibu Kabila, denounced the assassination the next day from his place of exile in South Africa, accusing the presidential guard of the killing. Her family were subsequently subject to threats and intimidation that made them fear claiming the body and arranging a funeral. Floribert Chebeya, president of VSV, which was investigating the death, said he feared that the police were trying to put pressure on him by summoning him for a road accident that had happened almost a year earlier. Floribert Chebeya was killed on 3 June 2010. He had been ordered to meet the national police chief, and had texted his wife to say he was at the police headquarters for the meeting, but it was not known what happened next. His partially undressed body was later found on the back seat of his own car. Chebeya was still investigating Aimee's death, and was involved in other activities that were unwelcome to the government. Government position The official story was that the two killers were simply thieves who had bought a gun from an army deserter or the police, and Aim√©e Kabila Mulengela had been shot accidentally. Two suspects were arrested on 25 January 2008 and the assault was reenacted two days later. General Oleko, Provincial Inspector of Police in Kinshasa, said during a press briefing that the victim was not connected to the presidential family and that he did not recognise that she bore the name of Kabila. According to Ambassador Th√©odore Mugalu, the victim was named Aim√©e Mulengela Koko, with a father from North Kivu and a mother from Equateur. The name Aim√©e Kabila had been assumed falsely. On 12 February 2013 the government spokesman and media minister Lambert Mende Omalanga said Etienne Kabila was involved in a conspiracy against the DRC that had been foiled by the South African authorities. He said Etienne Kabila was actually Etienne Kitsa, son of Raphael Kianzoluka of Bandundu and Fran√ßoise Kitsa Kikapu of South Kivu. He repeated that Aim√©e Mulengela Kabila was in fact Aim√©e Mulengela, daughter of a sergeant of the former Zairean National Gendarmerie based in Kipushi. She had been awarded a diplomatic passport based on her claim to be the daughter of the former president. Using this identity she started a household with Alain Barracuda, a patron of Congolese music who was trying to get closer to the presidential family. He said that Barracuda, having found that he had been tricked into investing large sums of money based on her assumed identity, had arranged to eliminate her physically on the night of 15 January 2008. When asked about the possibility of using DNA tests to put the matter to rest Lambert Mende strongly rejected the option, saying it would be a waste of time and money.

Smith (1895) pointed out that the original locality indication of Nassodonta insignis was ‚ÄúPeiho river, China‚Äù, and stated that on the label accompanying the type is written ‚ÄúPeihoi, fresh water, Calvert, with genus Velorita‚Äù. Smith further pointed out that the genus Velorita (Villorita cyprinoides, Gray, 1825) occurs only on the west side of the Indian Peninsula, in the neighbourhood of Cochin, and in the estuary of the river Kundapur, (where it is largely eaten by natives), and that it has never been found in China, and that ‚ÄúPeihoi‚Äù could be some small village on the Malabar coast.

He was a member of the Supreme People's Assembly and served as the Minister of Post and Telecommunications beginning in 2012. He has not been seen in public since October 2014, when he and six other officials disappeared in a purge connected to Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un. He was reportedly executed, though his death is unconfirmed.  Early life and education  Sim was born on 5 July 1960. He studied at the Faculty of Automation at Kim Il-sung University in Pyongyang between September 1982 and August 1987, where he received his Master of Engineering.  Career  From September 1987 to April 1995, Sim was the chief engineer at the Central Info- Communication Bureau. From May 1995 to November 2008, he worked as a manager and director of the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications. In December 2008, he was made Vice Minister of Post and Telecommunications, a position he held until December 2011. In 2010, he was named a member of the Central Auditing Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea. In January or February 2012, he became Minister of Post and Telecommunications. In that office, one of his main roles was overseeing the North Korean mobile phone network, Koryolink. In April 2013, he was reconfirmed as minister by the 13th Supreme People's Assembly. This was the last time he appeared in state media. In March 2014, Sim was elected to the Supreme People's Assembly for the Ongjin constituency. He, along with other close associates of the late Kim Jong-il, were reportedly put in the Assembly to help maintain a stable relationship between Kim Jong-un and older leading officials.  2014 purge and reported execution  On 23 October 2014, a source told the South Korean newspaper JoongAng Ilbo that they had received \\"reliable information\\" that six minister-level officials had been purged from the government and executed. Among the ministers listed were Sim, Ma Won-chun, General Ri Pyong-chol, Chang Ung, and Ri Yong-gil. Sim did not appear often in state media, but his absence from a meeting of North Korean officials with Naguib Sawiris, head of the Egyptian company Orascom Telecom, which provides North Korea's mobile network, was considered unusual. He has not been seen publicly since 2014, but his execution remains unconfirmed.  Personal life  Sim was married with two children. He spoke both Korean and English.

It saw combat in the Korean War and remained part of the U.S. military until being replaced in the late 1950s. Approximately 300 were built. Development and production history The M37 105 mm Howitzer Motor Carriage (named T76 105 mm HMC during development starting in 8 July 1943) was developed by the US on an extended M24 Chaffee base, and was intended to be the successor to the 105 mm M7 Priest. It used the same 105 mm Howitzer M4 as the ones mounted on some M4 Sherman medium tanks. The M37 HMC was an open topped vehicle using torsion bar suspension with tracks 16 in (41cm) wide. Though the gun performance was similar to that of the M7 Priest, the use of the lighter chassis from the M24 Chaffee made the self-propelled gun easier to handle. Service history Standardized for production in January 1945 with all units being built by the Cadillac Division of General Motors, the M37 was built too late to see action in World War II. However, it would see action with US forces as an artillery piece during the Korean War. Out of the 448 units ordered, 316 M37 HMCs were built. The M37's thin armor (0.5 in or 1.3 cm) could provide protection from small arms fire and artillery splash, but nothing greater. Its \\"pulpit\\" machine gun, like that of the M7 Priest, could be used for anti-aircraft purposes, and its 105 mm Howitzer M4 was able to turn a total of 51.7 degrees. Though its basis, the M24 Chaffee, was fast, the M37 was much more sluggish due to the amount of ammunition it carried (126 rounds), its recoil system, and the weight of the 105 mm howitzer M4. After the war, some units would see service in foreign countries, such as in the Spanish Army. Both the M37 as well as the M7 would be replaced in the late 1950s by the M52 HMC, a self-propelled gun built on the M41 light tank.

Her practice focuses on criminal defense, business litigation and civil rights litigation. Sossi also serves as a public defender in Harper Woods and Detroit. Sossi was elected as the Michigan Democratic Party Precinct Delegate for Precinct 4, Harper Woods on August 2, 2016. Personal life Pamela Sossi was born and raised in Harper Woods, Michigan. She is the daughter of Michael Sossi, a UAW/Chrysler electrician, and Marlene, a restaurateur. Sossi's family has owned Roma Cafe, the oldest Italian restaurant in Detroit, since 1919. Education A 2002 graduate of Harper Woods High School, Sossi received her undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan. In 2007, Sossi began working on her master's degree in Secondary Education and Teaching, also at the University of Michigan. In 2011, Sossi received her Juris Doctor, magna cum laude, from the University of Detroit Mercy School of Law. Professional career Sossi clerked for Bodman PLC, where she worked in the Banking and Real Estate section for five years. In law school, she served as the judicial law clerk for United States District Court judge, Patrick Duggan. Sossi passed the Michigan Bar Exam in October 2011, and shortly thereafter started her own business, The Law Office of Pamela Sossi, PLLC. She has recovered over a million dollars in verdicts and settlements for her clients, and has been named a \\"Top 10 Under 40\\" Attorney and listed as one of the \\"10 Best Female Attorneys\\" for both criminal law and personal injury law. In both 2016 and 2017, Sossi was named a \\"Michigan Rising Star\\" by Super Lawyers. Political career =2016 Primary Election= In 2016, Sossi ran against incumbent State Representative Brian Banks, for the Democratic nomination in the 1st District in the Michigan House of Representatives. The 1st District includes Harper Woods, Grosse Pointe Woods, Grosse Pointe Shores and a portion of northeast Detroit. Sossi's campaign was endorsed by the Detroit Free Press, National Organization for Women, Sheet Metal Workers International Association, United Union of Roofers, Waterproofers and Allied Workers, Michigan Retailers Association, Michigan Restaurant Association and the Michigan Credit Union League. During the campaign, attack pieces were mailed to voters that listed defunct Political Action Committees (PAC) in the political disclaimer required under the Michigan Campaign Finance Act (MCFA). The mail pieces sought to label Sossi as a Republican. Sossi is a member of the Michigan Democratic Party and a lifelong Democrat. Her boyfriend, Mike Norris, is a political consultant registered as a Republican in Florida. \\"My boyfriend isn't running for the seat,\\" Sossi said. On June 28, 2016, Banks was charged with three felonies and one misdemeanor by Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette. Because of Banks eight previous felony convictions, he was charged as a habitual offender and could have faced life in prison if convicted of the new felonies. On July 1, 2016, Banks held a rally at Bethany Christian Church, where his supporters claimed the new felony charges were unjust. Detroit City Council President, Brenda Jones argued that the charges were politically driven by Attorney General Bill Schuette, in an attempt to support Sossi's bid for the Democratic nomination. Schuette denied the suggestions. Despite Banks' significant fundraising advantage, Sossi led the race throughout the night until last minute votes were reported, giving Banks a narrow victory. On September 15, 2016, Michigan Secretary of State Ruth Johnson ruled that Banks used House funds or resources to mail invitations to an event promoting his campaign against Sossi, a violation of section 57 of the Michigan Campaign Finance Act. As a result, Banks was required to personally reimburse the Michigan House of Representatives for the materials and labor misused. On February 6, 2017, 26 days into his third term in the Michigan House of Representatives, Banks resigned his seat as part of a plea deal to avoid prison time. =2017 Special Primary Election= On February 9, 2017, Sossi declared her intention to run in the Special Election called to fill the vacancy that would be left by Banks' resignation or incarceration. On February 16, 2017, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder called a Special Election to fill the vacancy left by Banks resignation. Both the Governor and the Secretary of State's office ruled that Banks was not eligible to run for his own seat, ending speculation that he might do so. Additionally, Representative Aaron Miller filed HB 4208 to ensure that expelled or resigned former members could not run in the Special Election called because of the vacancy they caused. In April 2017, Tenisha Yancey, filed to run for the seat. Detroit Mayor Duggan campaigned for Yancey, citing Sossi's failure to support the Mayor's \\"D-insurance legislation.\\" As she did in 2016, Sossi won more votes in the suburbs winning Harper Woods, Grosse Pointe Woods and Grosse Pointe Shores. Unlike the 2016 Primary Election, Sossi also won Absentee Ballots. However, Yancey won by a 198-vote victory, to replace Banks in the Michigan House of Representatives due to the voter registration of the District.

Overview  Umi ni Ikuru Hitobito, whose name translates to \\"Those Who Live on the Sea\\", was written by Yoshiki Hayama and published in 1926.  Background  Hayama had spent a year in Waseda University where he picked up a few intellectual habits, but after leaving the university he worked on a ship carrying coal from Hokkaid≈ç and Yokohama. The novel recounts his experiences aboard this ship, divided between several characters: Fujiwara is the leader of a group of crew members on the Manju- maru who are on strike, representing Hayama's interest in Marxism; Hata is a hot-tempered seaman on a quest for justice, representing Hayama's youthful ardour; and Yasui, a man who injures his leg and is denied medical attention, mirroring an experience Hayama himself had. Hayama wrote the novel while in a Nagoya prison for union activity in 1924.  Plot  The story takes place in 1914, when the outbreak of war in Europe brings great wealth to Japan. The crew of the ship Manju-maru, however, suffer under a brutal and despotic captain and his officers as the ship journeys south from the port of Muroran. The captain is indifferent to the suffering of both his own men and those on a sinking ship nearby, and cares only for his own pleasures be they at home or at a hot spring in Muroran with a female companion. He treats any resistance on the part of those under his command as insubordination or laziness. The book describes the various hobbies of the sailors, some caring for nothing but women and others obsessed with confectioneries. One of the sailors, Fujiwara, dreams of liberating the proletariat, and while class-consciousness is on full display in the novel parts of Fujiwara's socialism are anachronistic for the setting. At the climax of the novel the sailors go on strike and demand an improvement to their working conditions, demands to which the captain accedes for selfish reasons. When the ship arrives in Yokohama, though, harbour police arrest Fujiwara and Hata, and four other ringleaders are expelled from the ship. The last line reads: \\"They waited for their punishment to be decided.\\"  Reception  Literary historian and critic Donald Keene called the work Hayama's \\"major contribution to the proletarian literature movement\\". While noting that the work has been praised as \\"epochmaking\\" and as a cornerstone of not only the proletarian literature movement but of all of Taish≈ç literature, Keene himself dismisses it as \\"a conspicuously bad book\\" when \\"[j]udged by normal standards of plot, characterization, style, and so on.\\"  Notes   References   Works cited  * 1926 novels Proletarian literature Taish≈ç-period works ","title":"Umi ni Ikuru Hitobito"},{"id":"55865859","text":"Bust of Thiemann by Ulla Scholl Birches by Carl Thiemann, color woodcut, 1908. Carl Thiemann (November 10, 1881 ‚Äì December 3, 1966) was a Bohemian artist and member of the Vienna Secession, best known for his color woodcuts. Life Carl Theodor Thiemann was born in Carlsbad, Bohemia, which was then part of the Austrian Empire (it is today known as Karlovy Vary and is in the Czech Republic). His father died when he was young, leaving the family in distressed circumstances; as a result, he initially went into trade rather than training as an artist. Eventually he was able to study at the Art Academy in Prague, first as a painter and later as a printmaker. He became interested in the Japanese technique of printing color woodcuts using water-based inks, which was then a new technique in Austrian art circles. In 1904 he moved to Prague and set up a studio with the artist Walther Klemm. In 1908, he and Klemm moved to the Dachau art colony, where he became a cofounder of the Dachau Artists' Association. Shortly thereafter, he married Louise Mi√©ville, a Swiss language teacher. Their daughter Margarete also became a painter. Around 1910 he became a member of the Vienna Secession and the Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund. He was widowed in 1957 and two years later he married a cousin, Ottilie Rady Thiemann-Stoedtner. Art Thiemann left an extensive oeuvre ranging from painting to all forms of printmaking. He is best known for his color woodblock prints of landscapes featuring trees (especially birch trees) and city streets, all rendered in a strongly graphic style with subtle coloration. His work was influenced by Martha Cunz's woodcuts, and it has stylistic affinities with such artists as Ferdinand Mirwald and Frances Gearhart. He won a number of awards, including the Federal Cross of Merit and the Golden Ring of Honor of the City of Dachau (1966). A street in Dachau is named after him.

He served as Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare of Zimbabwe between October and November 2017. He was expelled from the ZANU‚ÄìPF party during the 2017 Zimbabwean coup d'√©tat. Zhuwao was born in 1967 to Sabina Mugabe and a Mozambican father. His uncle is former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe. He studied at the University of Zimbabwe, where he earned two bachelor's degrees and four master's degrees. Zhuwao went on to become a tobacco farmer and businessman, with interests in several parastatals. He also founded a think tank, the Zhuwao Institute, which focused on economic development and was aligned with the policies of President Mugabe. Zhuwao entered politics in 2007 when President Mugabe appointed him Deputy Minister of Youth. A year later, he was elected to the House of Assembly for the Zvimba East constituency and was appointed Deputy Minister of Science and Technology, a position he held until 2012. In 2013, he was defeated in the ZANU‚ÄìPF primaries for reelection to Parliament. In 2015, he was named Minister of Youth Development, Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment. In October 2017, he was named Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare. In November 2017, he was expelled from ZANU‚ÄìPF because of his association with First Lady Grace Mugabe and the Generation 40 faction. He is now living in South Africa.  Early life and education  Zhuwao was born on 23 May 1967 to Sabina Mugabe and a Mozambican father. He is the brother of Innocent Mugabe, the former head of the Central Intelligence Organisation, and Leo Mugabe, a businessman and politician. Zhuwao is the only son of Sabina Mugabe who did not use her maiden name as his surname. He studied at the University of Zimbabwe, where he earned two bachelor's degrees and four master's degrees. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Computer Systems Engineering, a Bachelor of Science in Economics, a Master of Business Administration in Information Technology Management, a Master of Management, a Master of Public and Development Management, and a Master of Science in Economics. He earned his most recent degree, the MS in Economics, in September 2014.  Business career  Zhuwao owns Norton Tobacco Farm in Norton. He was said to have been involved in a salary dispute at Norton Farm when he allegedly went three months without paying the workers. Zhuwao confirmed the incident but said that because he was in the tobacco industry, he could only pay employees once the crop had been sold. Zhuwao also has business interests in Telecel Zimbabwe, a telecommunication firm that is Zimbabwe's second largest mobile phone operator, through the Empowerment Corporation of Zimbabwe, of which he is a stakeholder. In August 2013, he played a pivotal role in restoring Telecel Zimbabwe's license. Two months earlier, the Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe did not renew the company's expired license due to its failure to comply with Zimbabwe's indigenisation policy, which \\"requires that all foreign firms in Zimbabwe give up the majority of their ownership to black Zimbabweans\\". To help the firm renew its license, Zhuwao stepped in to reach a deal in which Telecel Zimbabwe made plans to comply with the indigenisation policy. Reportedly, Zhuwao himself planned to make himself the company's main shareholder, but reportedly the government did not agree to allow this. Nevertheless, the government renewed the firm's license, though Zhuwao said that his connection to President Mugabe was not a factor. In 2014, he was named chairman of the newly-created board of directors of the parastatal Zimbabwe Power Company by Minister of Energy and Power Development Dzikamai Mavhaire. In 2014, Zhuwao started his own think tank, the Zhuwao Institute. The Harare-based institute focuses on research and economic development. The think tank was described by Ken Mufuka writing in The Financial Gazette as having \\"jumped on the governmental bandwagon\\" for its association with the policies of Robert Mugabe.  Political career  Zhuwao entered politics in July 2007 when President Robert Mugabe appointed him Deputy Minister of Youth. His appointment was criticized by some as an example of nepotism, because Zhuwao is Mugabe's nephew. In 2008, Zhuwao was elected to the Zimbabwe House of Assembly for the Zvimba East constituency, as a member of ZANU‚ÄìPF. Bybit Lydia Tsomondo had dropped out of the race, clearing the way for him to run. From 2008 to 2012, he served as Deputy Minister of Science and Technology. In 2010, Zhuwao became a member of the Politburo of ZANU‚ÄìPF and the youth director of the party. In the 2013 parliamentary elections, Zhuwao was defeated in the Zvimba East ZANU‚ÄìPF primaries by Francis Mukwangwariwa, a farmer and former Central Intelligence Organisation operative. In October 2014, Zhuwao became involved in the heated ZANU‚ÄìPF succession infighting between Vice President Joice Mujuru and then-Minister of Justice Emmerson Mnangagwa. In an article published in state media, Zhuwao claimed that during a \\"coup\\" attempt at the residence of President Mugabe a week earlier, his wife Beauty Zhuwao slapped ZANU‚ÄìPF Mashonaland West provincial chairman Temba Mliswa after a tense verbal exchange. She reportedly slapped Mliswa, who did not retaliate, once, before others present intervened. Reports of the incident soon went viral on the internet. At a meeting with top government officials days later, Mugabe reportedly denied that a coup attempt occurred, expressed disapproval of the incident, and apologized to Mliswa on Beauty Zhuwao's behalf. Mugabe also reportedly questioned Media Minister Jonathan Moyo why Mliswa was being portrayed in state media as the aggressor when in reality, he was the victim of the assault. In December 2014, South African businessman Mutumwa Mawere threatened Zhuwao with legal action over \\"defamatory statements\\" Zhuwao wrote about him in a newspaper article. In the op-ed, published in The Sunday Mail, Zhuwao described Mawere as \\"ideologically bankrupt, devoid of ethics, morality and decency\\". On 11 September 2015, Zhuwao was appointed Minister of Youth Development, Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment by President Mugabe. He succeeded Christopher Mushohwe, who went on to become Minister of Information. On 21 July 2016, Zhuwao was ordered out of the Parliament building after he failed to respond to questioning during a Portfolio Committee session. Zhuwao had been called before the committee to answer questions about an allegedly corrupt deal he had brokered when he hired a private consultancy firm, whose owner Zhuwao had a personal relationship with, to spearhead Zimbabwe's National Economic Empowerment Strategy. At his questioning session before the committee on 21 July, Zhuwao engaged in a heated exchange with committee chair Justice Mayor Wadyajena. Other Members of Parliament accused Zhuwao of being under of the influence of drugs as he would occasionally burst out in \\"hysterical\\" laughter and declined to answer questions, only repeating the statement, \\"My name is Patrick Zhuwao, and can you allow me to respond in a manner that Patrick Zhuwao responds?\\" Chairman Wadyajena told Zhuwao to excuse himself if he was not ready to answer the questions. After a lengthy exchange, the committee asked Zhuwao to leave the chamber and return when he was \\"sober and when he understood the questions and issues involved.\\" Some lawmakers said they were surprised by his conduct, noting that in their previous interactions with him he had always been articulate. On 9 October 2017, Zhuwao was appointed Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare of Zimbabwe. He announced on 10 November that government employees would be receiving bonuses. = 2017 coup d'√©tat and aftermath = On 11 November 2017, it was often incorrectly reported that Zhuwao was taken into custody by the Zimbabwean military in relation to the 2017 coup d'√©tat. The reports that he was arrested were false; Zhuwao was in fact returning from a trip to South Africa, but turned around after hearing about the coup. On 19 November 2017, Zhuwao was expelled from ZANU‚ÄìPF by the party's central committee. Other prominent G40 politicians, including Grace Mugabe, Saviour Kasukuwere, Jonathan Moyo, Ignatius Chombo, Walter Mzembi, Shadreck Mashayamombe, Makhosini Hlongwane, Innocent Hamandishe, Samuel Undenge, and Sarah Mahoka were also expelled from the party. Even after fleeing the country, Zhuwao continued to be vocal in his defense of President Robert Mugabe, calling Mugabe's critics \\"dumb.\\" ZANU‚ÄìPF spokesman Nick Mangwana responded by saying that Zhuwao should stop making these remarks, calling them \\"inflammatory\\". On 27 November 2017, Mugabe's successor Emmerson Mnangagwa dissolved the Zimbabwean cabinet, allowing only Patrick Chinamasa and Simbarashe Mumbengegwi to remain as acting ministers of Finance and Foreign Affairs, respectively, until a new cabinet would be installed. In a December 2017 phone interview with The Standard, Zhuwao reported that during the coup, his farm was looted and his workers were beaten. He said that he was proud to have served in Mugabe's government, but that he was quitting politics and remaining in South Africa for the time being out of safety concerns. He said, \\"People can say I ran away‚Äîyes I did. It's better than to wait to be killed.\\" After the 2018 Bulawayo bombing, Zhuwao published an open letter to British Prime Minister Theresa May in which he urged her to dispatch Scotland Yard to Zimbabwe to investigate the attack. Zhuwao cited the example of the United States, which sent Federal Bureau of Investigation personnel to Ethiopia to investigate a bombing in Addis Ababa that happened on the same day as the Bulawayo bombing.  Personal life  Zhuwao is married to Beauty Lily Zhuwao. His son, Jason Zhuwao, is also active in ZANU‚ÄìPF politics and was reported to be planning to run for Parliament in the Harare Central constituency against MDC‚ÄìT leader Murisi Zvidzai.

This notion generalizes the notions of a hyperbolic group and of a relatively hyperbolic group and includes a significantly wider class of examples, such as mapping class groups and Out(Fn). Formal definition =Acylindrical action= Let G be a group with an isometric action on some geodesic hyperbolic metric space X. This action is called acylindrical if for every Rge 0 there exist N>0, L>0 such that for every x,yin X with d(x,y)ge L one has :# {gin Gmid d(x,gx)le R, d(y,gy)le R)} le N. If the above property holds for a specific Rge 0, the action of G on X is called R-acylindrical. The notion of acylindricity provides a suitable substitute for being a proper action in the more general context where non-proper actions are allowed. An acylindrical isometric action of a group G on a geodesic hyperbolic metric space X is non- elementary if G admits two independent hyperbolic isometries of X, that is, two loxodromic elements g,hin G such that their fixed point sets {g^+,g^-}subseteq partial X and {h^+,h^-}subseteq partial X are disjoint. It is known (Theorem 1.1 in ) that an acylindrical action of a group G on a geodesic hyperbolic metric space X is non-elementary if and only if this action has unbounded orbits in X and the group G is not a finite extension of a cyclic group generated by loxodromic isometry of X. =Acylindrically hyperbolic group= A group G is called acylindrically hyperbolic if G admits a non-elementary acylindrical isometric action on some geodesic hyperbolic metric space X. Equivalent characterizations It is known (Theorem 1.2 in ) that for a group G the following conditions are equivalent: *The group G is acylindrically hyperbolic. *There exists a (possibly infinite) generating set S for G, such that the Cayley graph Gamma(G,S) is hyperbolic, and the natural translation action of G on Gamma(G,S) is a non-elementary acylindrical action. *The group G is not virtually cyclic, and there exists an isometric action of G on a geodesic hyperbolic metric space X such that at least one element of G acts on X with the WPD ('Weakly Properly Discontinuous') property. *The group G contains a proper infinite 'hyperbolically embedded' subgroup. History Properties *Every acylindrically hyperbolic group G is SQ-universal, that is, every countable group embeds as a subgroup in some quotient group of G. *The class of acylindrically hyperbolic groups is closed under taking infinite normal subgroups, and, more generally, under taking 's-normal' subgroups. Here a subgroup Hle G is called s-normal in G if for every gin G one has Hcap g^{-1}Hg=infty. *If G is an acylindrically hyperbolic group and V=mathbb R or V=ell^p(G) with pin [1,infty) then the bounded cohomology H_b(G,V) is infinite-dimensional. *Every acylindrically hyperbolic group G admits a unique maximal normal finite subgroup denoted K(G). *If G is an acylindrically hyperbolic group with K(G)={1} then G has infinite conjugacy classes of nontrivial elements, G is not inner amenable, and the reduced C*-algebra of G is simple with unique trace. *There is a version of small cancellation theory over acylindrically hyperbolic groups, allowing one to produce many quotients of such groups with prescribed properties. *Every finitely generated acylindrically hyperbolic group has cut points in all of its asymptotic cones. *For a finitely generated acylindrically hyperbolic group G, the probability that the simple random walk on G of length n produces a 'generalized loxodromic element' in G converges to 1 exponentially fast as ntoinfty. *Every finitely generated acylindrically hyperbolic group G has exponential conjugacy growth, meaning that the number of distinct conjugacy classes of elements of G coming from the ball of radius n in the Cayley graph of G grows exponentially in n. Examples and non-examples *Finite groups, virtually nilpotent groups and virtually solvable groups are not acylindrically hyperbolic. *Every non-elementary subgroup of a word-hyperbolic group is acylindrically hyperbolic. *Every non-elementary relatively hyperbolic group is acylindrically hyperbolic. *The mapping class group MCG(S_{g,p}) of a connected oriented surface of genus gge 0 with pge 0 punctures is acylindrically hyperbolic, except for the cases where g=0, ple 3 (in those exceptional cases the mapping class group is finite). *For nge 2 the group Out(Fn) is acylindrically hyperbolic. *By a result of Osin, every non virtually cyclic group G, that admits a proper isometric action on a proper CAT(0) space with G having at least one rank-1 element, is acylindrically hyperbolic. Caprace and Sageev proved that if G is a finitely generated group acting isometrically properly discontinuously and cocompactly on a geodetically complete CAT(0) cubical complex X, then either X splits as a direct product of two unbounded convex subcomplexes, or G contains a rank-1 element. *Every right-angled Artin group G, which is not cyclic and which is directly indecomposable, is acylindrically hyperbolic. *For nge 3 the special linear group SL(n,mathbb Z) is not acylindrically hyperbolic (Example 7.5 in ). *For m e 0, n e 0 the Baumslag‚ÄìSolitar group BS(m,n)=langle a,tmid t^{-1}a^mt=a^nrangle is not acylindrically hyperbolic. (Example 7.4 in ) *Many groups admitting nontrivial actions on simplicity trees (that is, admitting nontrivial splittings as fundamental groups of graphs of groups in the sense of Bass‚ÄìSerre theory) are acylindrically hyperbolic.

He was a guide on the Horn Scientific Expedition to Central Australia, and police tracker and outlaw. He is notable for his many arrests. Early life Members of the Horn Expedition, Alice Springs, Central Australia, 1894 Arrarbi was identified as a quick learner and useful worker soon after the establishment of Tempe Downs cattle station in 1884. He was nominated as the preferred guide to that region for the Horn Scientific Expedition to Central Australia in 1894, due to his knowledge of the George Gill Range, an area which includes King‚Äôs Canyon, and due to his command of at least four local languages. He was later part of a raid by Charles Winnecke that plundered a huge repository of sacred cultural objects, known as tjurunga stones and boards. While he helped to interpret the designs of these artefacts for his European employer, he was not judged by local elders to be guilty of the theft itself, and escaped the death penalty meted out to another Aboriginal man who had led the party to the objects. Career Due to his usefulness to local European authorities, a local police identity, Constable Charles Cowle arranged a police job for him at Barrow Creek, 300 kilometres north of Alice Springs. Cowle‚Äôs hope was that the job would be far enough away from Tempe Downs to keep Arrarbi from joining local Aboriginal people in resisting the intrusion of the station on their lands and hunting the station‚Äôs cattle. However Arrarbi returned to Tempe Downs a few months later and within a couple of years was deemed to be one of the most active of the local people in the killing of cattle. For the next few years police tried unsuccessfully to arrest him while Arrarbi made a series of daring escapes as he continued to live by his wits in the rugged country around what is now the south western part of the Northern Territory. In 1899 his old sponsor Constable Cowle managed to arrest him and Arrabi was sent to gaol in Port Augusta 1200 kilometres to the south of his own country. However he was again back within a year, again successfully evading reprisals by Aboriginal and European enemies. Later life Arrarbi is thought to have rejoined the police force later in life, possibly working as a tracker in the Arltunga area in mid-1920s. He had two wives and several children, and is believed to have died in 1945. His life is interesting also for demonstrating the difficulty Central Australian Aboriginal people faced in navigating the changes brought by European invasion of their lands. Constable Cowle regarded him as a scoundrel, but anthropologist Baldwin Spencer, who also had contact with him, sympathized with Arrarbi and looked upon him as a hero for his people. He broke European laws, and also made some mortal enemies among aboriginal people. But he was leader in the resistance by local Aboriginal peoples against white intrusion and destruction of their way of life. In that sense, his life reflects the challenges faced by aboriginal people of the region during that time, as their traditional lands and water sources were occupied by European cattlemen.

The largest of these tombs has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since December 23, 1974. Overview The tombs are located on a hillside north of the Ota River, and were discovered by chance during the construction of a modern housing district in 1973. The largest of the tombs has a length of 8.3 meters, with a three-meter vestibule, in a rectangular layout, with a 3 by 2.8 meter opening. On the far wall, the tomb is decorated with designs in red iron oxide, depicting people, a horse, a sawtooth-like geometric design, red deer and spirals connected by red and white lines. The back wall and ceiling are also decorated with more than 250 red and white spots. Relics found within the tomb include bronze and gilt sword fittings, knives, glass and bronze beads, horse fittings and Sue ware pottery. From these grave goods it is estimated that the tomb dates from sometime in the 6th century AD.

The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 2006 by the Japanese government. Overview During the early to middle J≈çmon period (approximately 4000 to 2500 BC), sea levels were five to six meters higher than at present, and the ambient temperature was also 2 deg C higher. During this period, the T≈çhoku region was inhabited by the J≈çmon people, many of whom lived in coastal settlements. The middens associated with such settlements contain bone, botanical material, mollusc shells, sherds, lithics, and other artifacts and ecofacts associated with the now-vanished inhabitants, and these features, provide a useful source into the diets and habits of J≈çmon society. Most of these middens are found along the Pacific coast of Japan. The location of this shell midden is on a tongue-shaped ocean terrace near the southern border of Minamis≈çma, approximately 700 meters from the present coastline and at an altitude of approximately 20 meters. The surrounding alluvial area was reclaimed in modern times, and formerly consisted of rice paddies and forest, with a lagoon extending inland almost to the site of the midden. The foundation of a pit dwelling, a group of pillar holes and a grave were also found at the site. The midden itself extends 20 meters from east to west and 40 meters from north to south, and has a maximum depth of 1.8 meters, indicating that the site had been occupied for many centuries. Four shell layers have been discovered, consisting mostly of Asari clams, but the lower layers also included many fish bones from inshore fish species, and the later layers had bones from oceanic species (such as sharks, tuna and sea bream) indicating that the local inhabitants had the capability of offshore fishing as well as gathering of marine resources from inner bay areas. In addition, there were many animal bones, including that of deer and wild boar and of ducks, which indicates that the inhabitants had a varied diet. Fishing implements made from bone or animal horn were also excavated. There are no public facilities at the site, which is located approximately by car from Namie Station on the JR East J≈çban Line.

Transformational leadership development: Manual for the multifactor leadership questionnaire. Palo Alto, CA: Consulting Psychologists Press. The MLQ is composed of 9 scales that measure three leadership styles: transformational leadership (5 scales), transactional leadership (2 scales), and passive/avoidant behavior (2 scales), and 3 scales that measure outcomes of leadership. The MLQ takes an average of 15 minutes to complete and can be administered to an individual or group. The MLQ can be used to differentiate effective and ineffective leaders at all organizational levels and has been validated across many cultures and types of organizations.Atwater, L., Lau, A., Bass, B.

It is used for leadership development and research. The MLQ is designed as a multi-rater (or 360-degree) instrument, meaning that the leadership assessment considers the leader's self-assessment alongside the assessments of their leadership from their superiors, peers, subordinates, and others. The Leader (Self) Form and the Rater Form of the MLQ can be completed and assessed separately - however validity is much weaker when assessing leadership using only the Leader (Self) Form. Following the publication of the original MLQ in 1990, new versions of the MLQ were gradually developed to fit different assessment needs. The current versions of the MLQ are: Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire 360 (MLQ 360), Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire Self Form (MLQ Self), Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire Rater Form (MLQ Rater Form), Team Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (TMLQ),Bass, B. M., & Avolio, B.J. (1996). The Team Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (TMLQ). Palo Alto: Mind Garden, Inc. and Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire Actual vs. Ought. All MLQ versions are protected by copyright law and published by Mind Garden, Inc. The MLQ underwent a re-branding for its scales in 2015 with the justification of replacing the heavily-academic scale names with terms that would be more widely and easily understood by those outside of academia, such as business leaders and consultants. Recent academic research using the MLQ continue to use the original scale names.Antonakis, J., House, R.J., & Simonton, D.K. (2017). Can super smart leaders suffer from too much of a good thing? The curvilinear effect of intelligence on perceived leadership behavior. Journal of Applied Psychology, 102(7), 1003-1021. The MLQ is often combined with the Authentic Leadership Questionnaire (ALQ) to assess the self-awareness, transparency, ethics/morality, and processing ability of leaders (the ALQ was constructed by Avolio with William L. Gardner and Fred O. Walumbwa in 2007).Walumbwa, F.O., Avolio, B.J., Gardner, W.L., Wernsing, T.S., & Peterson, S.J. (2008). Authentic leadership: Development and validation of a theory- based measure. Journal of Management, 34(1), 89-126.  Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire Scales  = Transformational Leadership Scales = Transformational leadership is measured by 5 scales (20 items). This is the only leadership style measured by the MLQ that allows an overall average score of all subscales, though this overall score has less validity than each of the 5 subscales if interpreted individually. Higher scale scores in these subscales correspond to higher frequency of transformational leadership behaviors. * Builds Trust (formerly Idealized Influence - Attributes): This 4-item scale measures the frequency in which leaders build trust, inspire power and pride, and go beyond their own individual interests for their followers. * Acts with Integrity (formerly Idealized Influence - Behaviors): This 4-item scale measures the frequency in which leaders act with integrity, talk about their values and beliefs, focus on a desirable vision, and consider the moral and ethical consequences of their actions. * Encourages Others (formerly Inspirational Motivation): This 4-item scale measures the frequency in which leaders behave in ways that motivate those around them by providing meaning and challenge to their followers' work. * Encourages Innovative Thinking (formerly Intellectual Stimulation): This 4-item scale measures the frequency in which leaders stimulate their followers' effort to be innovative and creative by questioning assumptions, reframing problems, and approaching old situations in new ways. * Coaches & Develops People (formerly Individual Consideration): This 4-item scale measures the frequency in which leaders pay attention to each follower's needs for achievement and growth by acting as a coach or mentor. = Transactional Leadership Scales = Transactional leadership is measured by 2 scales (8 items). Higher scale scores in these subscales correspond to higher frequency of transactional leadership behaviors. * Rewards Achievement (formerly Contingent Reward): This 4-item scale measures the frequency in which leaders reward their followers in return for achievement of expected levels of performance. * Monitors Deviations & Mistakes (formerly Management-by-Exception: Active): This 4-item scale measures the frequency in which leaders monitor for deviations, mistakes, and errors and then take immediate corrective action. = Passive/Avoidant Behaviors = Passive/Avoidant behavior is measured by 2 scales (8 items). Higher scale scores in these subscales correspond to higher frequency of passive or avoidant behaviors during leadership activities. * Fights Fires (formerly Management-by-Exception: Passive): This 4-item scale measures the frequency in which leaders wait for a problem to appear before taking corrective action. * Avoids Involvement (formerly Laissez-Faire): This 4-item scale measures the frequency in which leaders refuse to assume the responsibilities that are a part of their position as leaders. = Outcomes of Leadership = Outcomes of leadership is measured by 3 scales (9 items) and is only asked to raters (the leader does not answer these questions). Higher scale scores in these subscales correspond to higher frequency of desired outcomes of leadership. * Generates Extra Effort (formerly Extra Effort): This 3-item scale measures the frequency in which leaders are perceived to be able to influence their followers to do more than they are expected to do. * Is Productive (formerly Effectiveness): This 4-item scale measures the frequency in which leaders are perceived as being effective when interacting at different levels of the organization. * Generates Satisfaction (formerly Satisfaction with the Leadership): This 2-item scale measures the frequency in which raters are satisfied with their leader's methods of working with others.  Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire Forms  The MLQ has five forms composed of 36, 45, 50,or 90 items to measure leadership style behaviors. = Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire 360 (MLQ 360) = The MLQ 360 is composed of two forms: the Leader Form (36 items) and the Rater Form (45 items). It is a multi-rater form, meaning that it analyzes the leader's self-assessment alongside how superiors, peers, subordinates, and others perceive their leadership behaviors. The MLQ 360 measures transformational leadership, transactional leadership, passive/avoidant behaviors, and outcomes of leadership. = Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire Rater Form (MLQ Rater Form) = The MLQ Rater Form is composed of 45 items and was designed to assess how the leader's superiors, peers, subordinates, and others perceive the leader's leadership behaviors. The MLQ Rater Form measures transformational leadership, transactional leadership, passive/avoidant behaviors, and outcomes of leadership. = Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire Self Form (MLQ Self) = The MLQ Self is composed of 36 items and was designed to assess how the leader perceives their own leadership behaviors. Psychometrics are not available for the MLQ Self as a stand-alone assessment of leadership styles. The MLQ Self measures transformational leadership, transactional leadership, and passive/avoidant behaviors. = Team Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (TMLQ) = The TMLQ is composed of 50 items and is designed for adults who work in a team. It represents an extension of the definition of transformational leadership from the individual to the collective. The TMLQ measures team transformational leadership, team transactional leadership, team passive/avoidant behaviors, and team outcomes of leadership. = Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire Actual vs. Ought (MLQ Actual. vs. Ought) = The MLQ Actual vs. Ought is composed of two forms: the Actual Form (45 items) and the Ought form (45 items). It is designed to measure how an individual perceives the frequency of the leadership behaviors they exhibit compared to the leadership behaviors they feel they should be exhibiting. The MLQ Actual vs. Ought measures actual transformational leadership, ought transformational leadership, actual transactional leadership, ought transactional leadership, actual passive/avoidant behaviors, ought passive/avoidant behaviors, actual outcomes of leadership, and ought outcomes of leadership.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Shu was elected to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and the National People's Congress. However, she was severely persecuted when the Cultural Revolution began in 1966 and died in March 1969. Shu is known for her versatility and her performances greatly influenced later generations of Chinese actors. In 2005, she was voted as one of the 100 best actors of the 100 years of Chinese cinema. Life =Early life= Shu Xiuwen was born in Anqing, Anhui Province, in 1915. She had three sisters. Her grandfather was a prominent Confucian scholar, but her family had become impoverished. When she was six her family moved to Beijing, where her father taught at a secondary school. When Shu was in high school herself, her father lost his job and she was forced to drop out to help her mother with the family's housework. Her parents both became addicted to opium and fell into debt. Her father tried to sell her to repay his debts, but she escaped and worked as an escort and dancing girl at a club on East Chang'an Street. =Early career= Shu on the cover of The Screen Pictorial, No.4 (1935) Considering her job humiliating, Shu Xiuwen‚Äîthen 16 years old‚Äîleft Beijing for Shanghai in the spring of 1931 to seek better opportunities. She found work teaching Mandarin at the Tianyi Film Company and served as a voice actress in Tianyi's Sing-Song Girl Red Peony (1931), China's first sound film, thus becoming China's first voice actress. She was also introduced to Chen Yumei, the star actress of Tianyi, who gave Shu a minor role in the film A Girl Named Yunlan 1932). Her acting experience enabled her to find work with the Jimei Song and Dance Troupe. Although the troupe folded soon afterward, through her professional connections she was able to join the Mayflower Drama Troupe led by the prominent leftist playwright Tian Han. However, the Kuomintang government disbanded the troupe for its leftist plays and arrested Shu's friend Gui Jiangong. The experience prompted her to become actively involved in the leftist movement. When Tian Han formed the new Spring and Autumn Troupe, Shu Xiuwen soon joined it and became its main actress. She performed many stage plays such as Death of a Star, Seven Women in the Storm, and Killing of an Infant. Following Tian Han, Shu joined the Yihua Film Company in 1932 and formally became a film actress. She starred in Tian Han's National Survival and Yang Hansheng's Raging Waves of the China Sea. She also performed with the Chinese Touring Drama Troupe. In 1934, she joined the Mingxing Film Company, and in the next three years she starred in at least 15 films before war broke out in 1937. Two films she co-starred in with Hu Die, Peach Flowers After Calamity and Fragrant by Night, were critically acclaimed. As her career blossomed, she moved her parents and sisters to Shanghai and financially supported them. =Wartime= When the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, Shanghai's film studios were mostly destroyed in the three months of fighting known as the Battle of Shanghai. Shu joined the mass exodus of refugees for the wartime capital Chongqing, where she worked for the government-run China Film Studio. She starred in several films such as Defend Our Land, A Good Husband, and Frontier Storm. When traveling to Inner Mongolia to shoot a film, she visited the Communist base at Yan'an and was received by Mao Zedong. From 1941 to 1946, Shu devoted herself to performing anti-Japanese and patriotic stage plays such as Thunderstorm and Sunrise by the famous playwright Cao Yu. Her acting skills established her reputation as one of China's \\"Four Great Actresses\\" of the time, together with Bai Yang, Qin Yi, and Zhang Ruifang. Shu returned to Shanghai after the war ended in 1945. She starred in several acclaimed films, including Killer, Weakness, Your Name Is Woman, and the most celebrated film of her career The Spring River Flows East. In 1948 and 1949, during the Chinese Civil War, Shu went to Hong Kong and starred in Flowers Fall in Spring City, Way of Love, and Wild Fire, Spring Wind. =Communist China= Shu Xiuwen in the 1950s After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Shu returned to Shanghai to work for the Shanghai Film Studio. She was transferred to Beijing in 1957 and became deputy art director of the Beijing People's Art Theatre. In this period she starred in the films Female Driver and Li Shizhen, and performed in the stage plays Rickshaw Boy and Guan Hanqing. Shu was elected to the 1st Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the 2nd and 3rd National People's Congress, the executive committee of the All-China Women's Federation, and the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. She also served as managing director of the China Theatre Association and the China Film Association. Like many film and drama workers, Shu Xiuwen was severely persecuted when the Cultural Revolution began in 1966. She did not survive the persecution and died on 17 March 1969 at age 54. Legacy Shu Xiuwen is remembered as one of the greatest actresses of her era, best known for her versatility. She was able to portray a wide range of roles both in film and on stage, including a rural woman forced to kill her newborn child because of abject poverty (Killing of an Infant), a naive but kind girl (Killer), and a polished but cruel social butterfly (The Spring River Flows East). In Flowers Fall in Spring City, she played two very different roles: a poor rural woman and her daughter who had been brought up in affluence in the big city. Her performances greatly influenced later generations of Chinese actors. In 2005, Shu was voted as one of the 100 best actors of the 100 years of Chinese cinema.

ACI emerged from, and is heavily influenced by, the discipline of human-computer interaction (HCI). In an ACI Manifesto (2011), Mancini defines one aim of ACI as understanding \\"the interaction between animals and computing technology within the contexts in which animals habitually live, are active, and socialize with members of the same or other species, including humans\\". Mancini's ACI Manifesto additionally proposes three core design goals for the field: enhancing animals' quality of life and wellbeing; supporting animals in the functions assigned to them by humans; and supporting human-animal relationships. Accordingly, ACI research gives considerable attention to questions of animal ethics, welfare, consent and power. A central theme of ACI research lies in establishing how user-centred design approaches and HCI methods can be adapted to designing with and for animals. Accordingly, many ACI studies seek to adopt 'animal-centred' approaches to design and research. Much ACI endeavour focuses on technologies to support communication and relationships between animals and humans. A number of researchers have investigated digital technologies for dogs, including systems for remote communication with dogs left at home, wearable interactive devices for dogs, and interfaces for working dogs ACI researchers have also explored technology to foster interactions with other domestic animals, including cats.

Incident Around October 2017 police accused 21-year-old Aasia (alt. Asiya) Bibi, her alleged boyfriend Muhammad Shahid, and her aunt of conspiring to mix rat poison into Aasia's husband's milk. According to the police, her husband refused the glass of milk, whereupon Aasia's mother-in-law innocently added the poisoned milk to a family vat, and used the milk in the vat the next day to make lassi (a yogurt drink) and butter. The lassi was then served during a family gathering. The poisoned family members were first treated by a hakim (a local traditional doctor) but were subsequently hospitalized in the city of Multan. Of 27 participants who were hospitalized, 17 people died, including the 23-year-old husband, Muhammad Amjad. Initially, it was claimed that a lizard had fallen into the milk and poisoned it. According to Jam Abdul Razzaq Klasra, a local police official, Ms. Bibi was the only person at the family gathering who did not drink the milk. During interrogation, Aasia allegedly confessed to poisoning the milk, and implicated her aunt and Shahid in the plot. Police have detained Aasia under antiterrorism laws. =Alleged motive= The couple had been married six months prior to the incident. Aasia has stated that she had begged her parents not to force her to marry, but her pleas were ignored. Police believe Aasia poisoned her husband to escape this forced marriage. Arranged marriages are common in rural Pakistan; offspring who attempt to defy an arranged marriage and instead \\"marry for love\\" are, in rare occasions, killed by family members. Salman Sufi, an aide in the Punjab provincial government, stated that conflicts centered on forced marriage often lead to \\"a severely fractured relationship between spouses or catastrophic aftereffects, like we witnessed in this case\\". There is little legal remedy for women who reject a partner chosen for them by their family. According to The Telegraph, cases of poisoning are common in Punjab; as recently as September 2017, a newlywed couple were poisoned by the bride's family for unknown reasons.

Bantwal married her husband in an arranged marriage and the couple moved to New Jersey in the United States in 1974. She continued her studies in the U.S., and received an M.A. in Public Administration from Rider University. After completing that degree, Bantwal began a job at the New Jersey Department of Labor, where she would work for the next 19 years. She currently resides in Arizona. Career Bantwal began writing in 2002 at the age of 50. Her books include The Dowry Bride (2007), The Forbidden Daughter (2008), The Sari Shop Widow (2009), The Unexpected Son (2010), The Full Moon Bride (2011), and The Reluctant Matchmaker (2012), all published by Kensington Books. Her books have been published in India by Fingerprint Publishing. She writes stories about contemporary Indian women and romance, and has described her style as \\"Bollywood in a book\\". Bantwal's plots feature women's issues like arranged marriages, cross-cultural stories from the Indian diaspora, and New Jersey settings. She has received some criticism for her focus on commercial and genre fiction, but she sees her books as a useful way to introduce a consciousness of cultural issues, especially those that affect women, to large audiences. Bantwal's short stories have been published in Romantic Times, India Abroad, Little India, India Currents, and New Woman. She won the Golden Leaf Award for Best Debut Book in 2008.

F√•berg Church is the only one of these churches with its tower on the west end; the others have a central tower. It is believed that the local architect Svend Tr√•seth designed the church. He later built several churches in the Gudbrand Valley and Valdres. The church was renovated in the 1800s by simplifying the interior and painting the walls white. During restoration in 1956 the church was returned to its old style. The baptismal font carved from soapstone dates from the 1100s. The altar has a painting by the F√•berg artist Ole Larsen Smerud. Smerud studied painting in Copenhagen, where he worked as a court painter and heraldic artist. Smerud's painting of Jesus on the cross was a gift to the church in 1810. Two doors from the old F√•berg Stave Church are preserved at the Museum of Cultural History in Oslo. A medieval crucifix from the stave church is on display at Maihaugen. The old alms box from the church, dating from 1668, is now in Garmo Stave Church at Maihaugen. Next to the church stands the F√•berg stone, a runestone believed to have been one of three monoliths standing near the church. The church can be reached via Norwegian County Road 255.

It was merged into Lillehammer municipality on January 1, 1964. The database for Norske Gaardnavne lists G√•rdsnummer 99-188 for F√•berg Parish in F√•berg municipality. The Matrikkelutkastet av 1950 lists G√•rdsnummer 1-191 as part of F√•berg because F√•berg municipality included all of Lillehammer municipality at that time. The records after 1964 list G√•rdsnummer 1-191 as part of Lillehammmer Municipality instead of F√•berg because of the 1964 change. The online parish records start in 1727 for F√•berg Prestegjeld and in 1901 for Lillehammer Prestegjeld at Digitalarkivet.

A bike freeway, also known as a cycling superhighway, fast cycle route or bicycle highway, is an informal name for a bicycle path that is meant for long-distance traffic. There is no official definition of a bicycle highway. The characteristics of a cycle motorway mentioned by authorities and traffic experts include an absence of single- level intersections with motorized traffic, a better road surface (preferably asphalt or concrete) and the absence of traffic lights. Bicycle highways are mentioned in connection with traffic jam. Owing to higher average speeds than normal cycling infrastructure, they provide an alternative to the car in commuter traffic. Often a cycle motorway follows the route of a railway. Legal uses In the Netherlands, the following people can use a bike freeway: * Cyclists: 'ordinary' cyclists, recumbents, cargo bikes, velomobiles, pedelecs * Riders of a motorized bicycle with a maximum speed of 25 km / hour * Depending on the location also mopeds, with a maximum speed of 40 km / hour * Pedestrians if pavement and footpath are missing * Riders of a segway * Drivers of a disabled vehicle. However, a maximum speed of 30 km / hour applies to them. Features =Netherlands= In the Netherlands the bicycle highway is not defined in the RVV (). However, there is a guideline for developing bicycle highways. The Dutch Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management describes the bicycle highway as a long cycle path without crossings, on which cyclists can travel long distances. By building bicycle highways, the government hopes, among other things, to promote the use of bicycles for commuter traffic and thus prevent traffic jams. =Belgium= In Belgium this type of cycle path is not mentioned in the Road Code. In Belgium, especially the provincial governments and the Flemish Region take the initiative for the construction of bicycle highways. At the Flemish Regional level there are no guidelines on the design of cycle highways, only on 'normal' cycle paths. In practice, there are differences between the provinces. This is because the authorized Flemish departments (MOW, Department of Policy) and agencies (AWV) are organized per province, which results in different emphasis per region. They are called a bicycle highway because of the route signaling. There is no maximum speed (for cyclists), unless indicated otherwise. The Flemish bicycle highways are numbered and indicated as such. All routes are indicated with a number starting with an F, going from F1 to F791 (The 'F' refers to 'Fiets' (Dutch for bike)). =Cost of construction= The cost of building a bicycle super highway depends on many things, but is usually between ‚Ç¨300000/km (for a wide dedicated cycle track) and ‚Ç¨800000/km (when complex civil engineering structures are needed). =Lane width= In the Netherlands: * The minimum desired width of the bicycle lane is 2.00 meters on the bicycle highway. The absolute minimum width of the bicycle lane is 1.50 meters. In Belgium: * Antwerp: double direction bicycle paths must be at least 3 meters wide * Flemish Brabant: double-direction bicycle paths must be 4 meters wide (at least 3 meters), single-direction bicycle paths 2.5 meters (at least 2 meters) * East Flanders: double-direction cycle paths must be at least 3 meters wide. Bike freeways by country = Belgium (Flanders) = Within Flanders, a network of bike freeways, consisting of around 120 routes, is being rolled out, connecting all Flemish cities. All routes are indicated with a number starting with an F, going from F1 to F791. The whole network will consist of 2400 km bike freeways, connecting all Flemish cities. As of 2018, around 1500 km is completed. Most Flemish cities are therefore already connected by bike freeways or a temporary alternative. It's therefore possible to travel around the whole Flemish region by bike from city to city with a nearly absence (or at least minimum) of single-level intersections with motorized traffic (\\"without a single stop\\"). Ghent is for example connected by bike freeways to almost all neighbouring Flemish cities (Bruges, Deinze, Kortrijk, Roeselare, Oudenaarde, Antwerp,...). Many bike freeways are purpose-built bicycle superhighways with dedicated bicycle bridges and intersections or at least (two-way) bicycle paths. Many purpose- built bike freeways follow the route of the railway system. However, many existing towpaths along rivers and canals have also been integrated within this network of bike freeways as they often responded to the minimum requirements with only minor adaptations. =Netherlands= The first Dutch route opened in 2004 between Breda and Etten-Leur; many others have been added since then. In 2017 several bicycle superhighways were opened in the Arnhem- Nijmegen region, with the RijnWaalpad as the best example of this new type of cycling infrastructure. =Denmark= In Denmark there exists a network of long-distance and high-speed cycle paths connecting the suburban areas of Copenhagen with the city core. There are eight routes in operation in September 2018. There are plans of building 45 routes with a total length of 476 km by 2021 in the cities and municipalities of the Capitol Region of Denmark.http://supercykelstier.dk/about/ The first Danish route, C99, opened in 2012 between the Vesterbro rail station in Copenhagen and Albertslund, a western suburb. The route cost 13.4 million DKK and is 17.5 km long, built with few stops and new paths away from traffic. ‚ÄúService stations‚Äù with air pumps are located at regular intervals, and where the route must cross streets, handholds and running boards are provided so cyclists can wait without having to put their feet on the ground. Similar projects have since been built in Germany among other countries. =Germany= There are also plans in Germany to build bicycle highways. A 100 km long fast cycle route has been planned between the cities of Duisburg and Hamm, the first parts of which were completed in 2015, this includes a disused railway line. In addition, there is a plan to connect Aachen via a 30 km-long cycle route with the Dutch town of Heerlen. This route is known as the Radschnellweg St√§dteRegion Aachen. =Sweden= Sweden's first bicycle highway was built in the municipality of √ñrebro in 2012. Bicycle highways was also built in 2018 in Ume√• Municipality. =United Kingdom= Cycle Superhighway CS7 start point at Colliers Wood Underground Station In London, twelve new bicycle routes, dubbed Cycle Superhighways, were announced in 2008 by Mayor Ken Livingstone, with the aim of creating continuous cycle routes from outer London into and across central London by the end of 2012. , only seven cycle superhighways were operational: CS1‚ÄîCS3 and CS5‚ÄîCS8.

The Corowa Free Press was a weekly English language newspaper published in Corowa, New South Wales, Australia, between 1875 and 1928.  History  The Corowa Free Press was first launched by James Crauford Leslie and John William Hutchinson Wyse on 8 October 1875. James Crauford Leslie (1848-1907) was born in Scotland and emigrated to Melbourne, Australia with his family in 1854. In 1874 after being decorated for his involvement in the Maori Wars, he moved to Wahgunyah, Victoria to manage The Chronicle which served the cross-border towns of Wahgunyah and Corowa in New South Wales. After The Chronicle folded in September 1875, Leslie crossed the border to set up The Corowa Free Press. Wyse left the paper in 1880 and Leslie was the sole proprietor until his death on 20 February 1907. In 1887 James Crauford Leslie was fined fifty pounds in default of 6 months imprisonment on a charge of criminal libel. In 1900 the NSW Country Press Association (NSWCPA) was formed by country press proprietors in reaction to the failure of politicians to amend the libel laws of NSW and Leslie became its first president. Leslie was also instrumental in the formation of the Australian Provincial Press Association. After James Crauford Leslie died, his wife Mary Isabella took over the reins with the couples sons Arnot Crauford Leslie and Guy Crauford Leslie as editors. Guy Crauford Leslie died on 1 April 1926 and Arnot took on Guy's son Conrad Crauford Leslie. Arnot died in 1954 and Conrad continued until his death in 1962. The Crauford dynasty continued when Conrad's wife of twenty-five years Annie Helen (Dixie) Crauford became proprietor and editor. Annie eventually sold the paper to Noel and Pat Loughnan, owners of the Yarrawonga Chronicle, on 31 January 1980. The Corowa Free Press absorbed The Corowa Chronicle on 1 February 1928.

Biography  Sunao Tokunaga was born on January 20, 1899, in Kumamoto Prefecture. He was one of first writers of the Japanese proletarian literature movement of the 1920s to come from a truly lower-class background. He dropped out of elementary school, and at the age of twelve became a printer's apprentice. In 1922, he began working for the Hakubunkan Press (ÂçöÊñáÈ§®Âç∞Âà∑ÊâÄ Hakubunkan-insatsusho), later renamed to the Ky≈çd≈ç Press (ÂÖ±ÂêåÂç∞Âà∑ÊâÄ Ky≈çd≈ç- insatsusho). He took part in union activities while actively writing. The union restricted his literary actities and extracted a promise from him that he would not write any novels. In 1926, he joined some 3,000 Ky≈çd≈ç employees in striking. After more than two months, the union was completely defeated, and 1,700 employees, including Tokunaga, were fired. This experience provided inspiration for his most important novel, Taiy≈ç no nai Machi (Â§™ÈôΩ„ÅÆ„Å™„ÅÑË°ó, \\"The Street without Sunlight\\"), which he began in 1928. He eventually found another printing job at a large company, and while working there began his literary career. He joined the Japan Proletarian Writers' League (Êó•Êú¨„Éó„É≠„É¨„Çø„É™„Ç¢‰ΩúÂÆ∂ÂêåÁõü Nihon Puroretaria Sakka D≈çmei, also abbreviated \\"NALP\\") in February 1929. In March 1932, Tokunaga wrote an article expressing a desire for a popular literature that the proletariat could enjoy, which inspired a sharp critical response from Takiji Kobayashi, accusing Tokunaga of \\"right-wing, opportunistic tendencies\\". In May of the same year several members of NALP, including Tokunaga, were rounded up for questioning by police following a meeting, but Tokunaga was soon released. He left the League in October of the following year over what he saw as their prioritizing politics over literary merit. In October 1937 he requested his publisher withdraw Taiy≈ç no nai Machi from print in light of the breakout of war with China. He saw it as necessary for Japanese to unify during the war. He continued to publish short stories and essays that were inoffensive to the authorities throughout the Pacific War. In 1945, immediately following Japan's loss in the war, Tokunaga, Shigeharu Nakano, Yuriko Miyamoto and others formed the Shin Nihon Bungakkai (\\"New Japanese Literary World\\") as a successor to the various pre-war socialist literary groups. He joined the Communist Party of Japan in 1946,Taiy≈ç no nai Machi allowed the republication of Taiy≈ç no nai Machi,Taiy≈ç no nai Machi and was welcomed back into the proletarian literary movement. In 1954, he journeyed to Moscow to represent Japan at the Congress of the Soviet Writers' Union. He died on February 15, 1958.

It was founded in 1769 by 22 benefactors at a dinner held in honour of the wealthy 17th-century Bristol merchant, slave trader and philanthropist Edward Colston at the Three Tuns Tavern in the medi√¶val quarter of Bristol. To perpetuate Colston's memory, the first president of the society Gilbert Davies took up a collection to benefit the poor and elderly. Since then there have been annual collections coordinated by presidents who are elected to one-year terms. Today the society holds an annual dinner on 'Colston day' (November 13 or 14 in the Georgian calendar) to announce the result of an annual fund-raising drive, which takes place during the first two weeks of November and is known as the President's personal collection. Money collected from this event is spent throughout the year on grants, befriending, housing and projects to benefit the poor and elderly. The Anchor Society is closely aligned with the Dolphin Society and the Grateful Society, both of which also help older people in the greater Bristol area. All three societies also gather in mid November to celebrate their charitable work at an annual service held in St Stephen's Church in the centre of the city.

Early life Corett√© Elisabeth Hardy was born on Dec. 5, 1881 (or 1883) in Churchville, New York to Carrie Carter and Thomas J. Hardy. Thomas migrated north to Brooklyn around 1875 from Petersburg, Virginia. During the summer of 1879, he met and soon married Carrie Carter (another migrant from Richmond, Virginia). In April 1880, while employed as a servant for the Walach family (a German family living in Long Island), Carrie bore him a son, who did not survive, and the couple traveled north to the township of Churchville, where Carrie bore two children, Corett√© (1881) and Anna (1884). Sometime between 1886 and 1888, the family returned to Manhattan, where eight more children were born, with Edward (1889), Isabella Clara (1892), and Miles (1895) the only ones to survive childhood. The family resided at 140 West 19th Street in the busy Midtown district, where the young Hardy children played along Seventh Avenue, where carriages, streetcars and pedestrians strolled along between Carnegie Hall and Times Square. Like most African-American families, the Hardy family encountered housing discrimination, living in tenement apartments with high rents, ragged wallpaper, sparse furnishings, coal-fired stoves, ceilings that scattered plaster onto the floor, while bedroom overlooked air shafts that carried in foul air. By 1895, the family found itself frequently moving from apartment to apartment. Little is known about Corett√©'s school years, although she later claimed that they were filled with boredom and bitter disappointment, particularly due to an incident in which a teacher refused to allow her to participate in the spring musical due to her being Negro. These interviews were not entirely reliable: in one she recollected attending one school on 99th and West End Avenue and later a high school on 85th Street, although the Hardy family lived nowhere near either school, and, more importantly, neither of those schools existed during her childhood. Wherever she attended school, she left around 1896 and, as the oldest child, immediately went out to work. Another of Corret√©'s later claims was that at that date African-Americans were unable to study music in the United States. However the National Conservatory of Music, not far from where Corett√© grew up on 47-49 W. 25th Street, was open to African-Americans from 1893, when the Czech composer and director of the Conservatory, Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k permitted Negroes to study there free of charge. (The famous Negro composer, violinist and choral director, Will Marion Cook studied at the school in 1894-95.) Instead, 19-year-old Corett√© Hardy found employment as a copyist (transcribing documents) and the Mt. Olivet Baptist Church Choir served as her musical outlet. In the early 1900, the family relocated to 448 W. 54th Street in the heavily industrialized Hell's Kitchen district, primarily inhabited by Irish immigrants who worked on the Hudson River docks or the railroads. In the sprng of 1901, Corett√© saw an advertisement in the New York Herald posted by German theatrical impresario, Paula Kohn-W√∂ellner, seeking seven Negro women with the ability to sing and dance for a concert tour of Germany. Corett√© was initially selected, but when only six were chosen to be in the ‚ÄúLouisiana Amazon Guard‚Äù troupe, Corett√© remained in New York as a standby performer. Career =Early career (1902‚Äì1907)= That June, accompanied by Fannie Smith (from Philadelphia), she traveled to join the company. For four successful months, the troupe traveled across central Europe, performing in Zurich, St. Gallen, Munich and Leipzig. Owing to financial exploitation and mismanagement, in October, after a month's engagement in Dresden, the women severed relations with their impresario and elected the lead girl, Ollie Burgoyne as the troupe manager. Now as the ‚ÄúFive Louisianas‚Äù, the troupe relocated to Berlin in November, where they performed locally for five more months. In March 1903, during their Dresden engagement, the entire troupe walked out on their German impresario. Kohn-W√∂llner was taken to court and accused of exploiting them financially. Lead performer Ollie Burgoyne was elected as their new manager and, now as the \\"Five Louisianas\\", the women left for Berlin, where they entertained at the Orpheum Theater and Harmonie Circus. After a brief engagement in Trier and Aachen, the group suddenly disappeared. In March 1903, Ollie Burgoyne and Florence Collins renewed their American passports and departed for London to join the cast of Hurtig & Seamon's \\"In Dahomey\\", which opened on March 16 at the Shaftesbury Theatre. The four remaining women, continued performing around Germany for the next three months before departing for the Russian Empire. After receiving a passport from Berlin's American Embassy (July 10th, 1903), the troupe traveled northwest to Saint Petersburg, to appear for two months at the popular Krestovskiy Garden Amusement Park, where they opened on July 19th. On September 29th, the troupe opened in Moscow at Aumont's French Theater for a another two months billed as the \\"4 Ebony Belles\\". The focal point of Moscow's lively nightlife, located just west of Triumphal Square, the Aumont Theater was an entertainment garden occupying several park-like acres that was a relief from the more genteel and prosperous classes of society, who weren't put off by the frivolous nature of the establishment's entertainment. That evening, as the crowds made their way from the theater towards the open-air caf√© chantant, the troupe joined twenty variety acts onstage varying from trained animals and acrobats to operatic singers. The theater director, Charles Aumont, was a successful yet ruthless French-Algerian businessman that renovated the gardens in 1898 to make visitors feel like they had visited a magical world. He was well known for exploiting chorus girls and female performers to allure the largely male audience. After their turn onstage, the head Ma√Ætre d‚Äô (an African-American man named, Frederick Bruce Thomas), informed the women that as singers, they would be called upon after their performance to entertain the private parties. During the winter of 1903, the Louisiana Amazon Guard (Ebony Belles) finally dissolved. Alverta Burley married African-American entertainer, Oliver E. Brodie and the couple toured as \\"Brodie & Brodie\\". Harris convinced Corett√© Hardy and Fannie Smith to remain in Russia with her and they formed the \\"Harris Trio\\". For the next six months, the trio performed between Saint- Petersburg and Moscow. In March 1904, the duo became the \\"Harris Trio\\" with the addition of Fannie Smith, and together they departed for Helsinki with an engagement at the illustrious Hotell Fennia, where Finnish high society enjoyed to mingle. During the summer of 1904, the Harris Trio, together with Ollie Bourgoyne and Jennie Scheper (from the Florida Creole Girls) formed a new company known as the \\"Creole Troupe\\" and continued touring the principal Russian cities. On January 22, 1905, while attending a party, hosted by popular American jockey, William Caton, in central Saint-Petersburg, the women witnessed the Bloody Sunday riots outside the Tsar's palace and across the city. The trio immediately packed up and returned to Moscow, where they resumed working at the Aumont Theater. In February, while performing in the city of Vyatka, the trio decided to dissolve and Corette and Fannie departed for Poland. On June 6, 1907, the nascent 1905 Revolution was extinguished with brutal force. Although order was established, the issues that sparked the violence remained and fueled the peasants' desire for revenge. A tense atmosphere gripped the country. There was the constant presence of the strongly emerging left-wing movement which was bent on purging the decadence of Tsarist Russia. A small suffragette movement swelled across Russia. The emancipation of women brought a shift in Russian society, billowing Victorian gowns were thrown aside and replaced by fashionable unimpeding svelte dresses designed by designer Lamanova. Divorce laws were eased in response to feminine demands for freedom of choice in marriage. Throughout the summer, theaters and cabarets reopened, foreigners returned and entertainers resumed their tours through the major cities. Throughout the year, Black entertainers traveled to Russia in droves. All across Russia, Black performers such as Belle Davis, Abbie Mitchell, Josephine Morcashani, the Black Troubadours, and the popular duo Johnson & Dean filled the music halls with excitement every night. In St. Petersburg, a confectioner exploited the popularity of Ragtime by issuing the latest Negro minstrel hits on records pressed into discs of hard baker's chocolate. By September 25, Corett√© resurfaced in Russia, renewing her passport at Moscow's US Embassy. Since Fannie Smith was in St. Petersburg around that time, Corett√© might now have begun working as a solo artist. =The Indian Nightingale (1908‚Äì1912)= The year 1908 was full of success for nearly every African-American expatriate across the Russian Empire. In Moscow, Miss Pearl Hobson was a popular headliner at the illustrious Yar Restaurant. Also backstage at the Yar, was waiter Frederick Thomas, back in Moscow after the terrible 1905 Revolution and employed at the restaurant as the new artistic director and Miss Hobson's manager. Emma Harris was performing around the city as, Galima Oriedo, a popular opera singer and exotic dancer with a style similar to Mata Hari. In St. Petersburg, former leader of the Louisiana Amazon Guards, Ollie Burgoyne was a popular headliner, mistress to a Russian noble named Sasha who provided her with a beautiful mansion on the outskirts of the capital and was preparing to an open French lingerie boutique. Also in performing in the Russian capital, Corette became accustomed to the Russian tradition of a bouquet of flowers and carriage ride through the city, if they admired you. Eventually, after five months of courtship, one of her admirers, a nobleman named Utin, proposed to Corett√© and invited her to move into his home in central St. Petersburg. It's currently unknown which member of the Utin household Corette, although it's been narrowed down between the wealthy prosecutor, Sergey Yakovlevich Utin or his cousin, the lawyer, Vladimir Lvovich Utin. The Utin family, originally successful Jewish merchants, after converting to the Eastern Orthodox Church in the 1850s, became an extremely wealthy bunch of bankers, business tycoons (Baku Oil Company), lawyers and politicians that owned (or built) an abundance of property in the Russian capital. At the elaborate dinners organized on the numerous family homes and estates, members of government, businessmen, writers, and scientists were frequent guests. Everyone in the family was exceptionally educated, ambitious and surprisingly radical in their thinking. The family had taken part in the 1861 student movement and the Decembrist Revolution. Despite the Russia's national anti-Semitic attitudes, the family never forgot their Jewish heritage and maintained positive relations with Russian Jews. From the beginning, the marriage was marred by jealousy from her in-laws who felt that her husband had married beneath him. He was accused of renouncing his family for a Negro that couldn't speak Russian. Despite this, Corett√© suddenly Russified her name as Coretti Genrichovna de Utina (Russian: –ö–æ—Ä–µ—Ç—Ç–∏ –¥–µ-–£—Ç–∏–Ω–∞) and possibly even petitioned to St. Petersburg's Ministry of the Interior to receive Russian citizenship, as she suddenly stops bothering to renew her American passport and the U.S. Embassy no longer keeps any records of her. After the wedding, Coretti returned to the stage as the Indian Nightingale, Madame de Utina (sometimes spelled Outina). She soon emerged as a popular dramatic soprano singer at every major music hall, cabaret and restaurants across the Tsar's dominion. She would sing beautiful Russian Romance ballads (in imperfect Russian), American pop songs (which the audiences loved) and Negro spirituals. Those were halcyon days. Her marriage into a wealthy Russian family provided her with insight into a different side of Russia. In the households of Russian high society, there was an invisible glass barrier. Distinguishing the aristocracy from the workers was terribly important, but not always easy. The nobles walked on one side of the street, and the servants and peasants on the other. Although everyone attended the same churches, there was a separate entrance for the noblemen and their families, which led to a raised enclosure reserved for them. She also witnessed the miserable conditions of the peasantry, living in poverty, ignorance and filth from the cradle to the grave under the interlocking power of the landlords, the orthodox church and the Tsar. They lived upon small strips of land which was insufficient to support them. They often were forced to work an allotted number of days on the vast estates of the wealthy landowners or for Kulaks (rich peasants). If they were unable to pay their taxes, the gendarmerie paid them a visit, seizing their horses, hogs, cows and anything else of value. Coretti watched from the windows as the peasants wept and merely declared that it was will of God. That thus it had always been, and so it must always be. From 1908-1909, Coretti appeared at the New Summer Garden Theater, a wooden theater located on 58 Bassenaya (now 58 Nekrasov) that staged operas and operettas. In August 1908, she appeared in Franz von Supp√©'s operetta, Boccaccio in the minor role as Sisti, a servant (August 31, 1908). The following year, she appeared in Letim, a three-act revue. She had a minor role in the revue, singing in Italian (July 16‚Äì31, 1909). In the fall of 1910, Coretti returned to New York after eight years abroad and paid her family a visit at 218 West 64th Street. There she found the family had fallen upon hard times and relocated to the dangerous San Juan Hill district. There tensions between Negroes and the Irish (east of Amsterdam Ave) ran high. The neighborhood was also a terribly congested predominately with African Americans and Caribbeans immigrants. Her father was laboring as an elevated railway porter, her mother still scrubbing floors for the white families and her brother Edward selling newspapers on every street corner across San Juan Hill. Young Clara and Miles were still attending the nearby school. Although the family was happy to reunite with Coretti, the joy quickly dissolved whenever the subject of her recent marriage came up. Her parents weren't to pleased nor did they accept their daughter's marriage to a white man. Soon newspapers began reporting about the musical appearances of ‚ÄúCoretta de Outine of St. Petersburg‚Äù. An old acquaintance of Coretti, Richetta G. Randolph helped to arrange her appearances in hotels, clubs, churches and other social functions around the city. On October 27, Coretti appeared in the musical cantata, ‚ÄúJephthah and his Daughter‚Äù held at the Mt. Olivet Debating Club. After the performance, Toastmaster Allison presented Coretti with a gold pin as a token of appreciation for her performance. The following month, on November 28, at the Jubilee Quartette Reception held at the Hotel Maceo, Coretti beautifully performed, ‚ÄòDo not say that the grave ends all‚Äô. Eventually, the tour came to a halt as Coretti could no longer stand America's prejudiced attitudes, especially since she had become so accustomed to being able to frequent any restaurant or public space that she wanted in Europe. On December 5, Ms. Randolph threw a large going away party at her apartment at 248 W. 53rd Street before Coretti boarded another ship five days later back home to Russia. Back home, Coretti embarked upon a tour across the Russian Empire. In May 1911, she was appearing at St. Petersburg's Jardin d'Hiver Theater (previously known as the Apollo Theater), located at Fontanka 13. Two months later in July, she was in Kiev at the Apollo Garden Theatre. Located at 8 Meringovskaya St, a three-story stone building, known as the Noble Club, housed the Apollo restaurant with its open-air stage that showcased variety, opera and theatrical productions daily. The following month, she arrived in Latvia just outside the capital of Riga in the seaside resort town of J≈´rmala. The town, with its wooden art nouveau villas, sanatoriums and long sandy beaches was already a popular tourist destination for Soviet officials and top union members. In the Edinburgh neighborhood (now Dzintari), the Rigasche Rundschau newspapers advertised Coretti's debut at the Edinburger Sea Pavilion on August 10. Rigasche Rundschau: ‚ÄúMlle Outina, the Indian Nightingale. The fact that that a black is a Russian Romance singer, you probably never heard of such and yet she behaves as so. Originating from the United States, Fraulein Outina came to Russia, where she was the main attraction in the south (Ukraine), Moscow and St. Petersburg, and was received enthusiastically everywhere. Here, too, she had great applause yesterday upon completing her first song, because she has good qualities and a beauty for her race. It was pleasant to say that her manner and costume were free from any theatrical gimmicks and completely natural and discrete. Furthermore, the directors succeeded in accordance with general wishes to extend her stay for another five days.‚Äù Unfortunately, during the course of her tour, a double agent shot and killed Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin while he attended a performance at the Kiev Opera House. The Tsar was so near the Prime Minister, that he heard the shots himself. A sense of doom settled over Russia, many felt apocalypse was fast approaching and no one and nothing could stop it. From January 1-14, 1912, Coretti was in Kharkov performing at V. Jatkin's famous scandulous Villa Jatkina cabaret, located on the Kharkov embankment along the Kharkiv river. During her two-week engagement, she received word from friends in Moscow about the sudden untimely death of one of her children. On January 15, 1912, several newspapers reported that a Mlle. Outina, a black woman married to a Russian and follower of the Lutheran religion, was sent to Alexandrovskaya Hospital for a suicide attempt. =Musical education and the Russian Revolution (1913‚Äì1917)= The country-wide celebration, known as the Romanov Tercentenary, started 1913 off with a bang. This celebration marked the 300th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty beginning with a week of receptions at the Winter Palace in February before the Imperial family took a pilgrimage in May to Moscow and the numerous cities that once occupied the ancient territory of the Grand Duchy of Muscovy. While Russia was opening the year in bliss and jubilation, the Utin household was filled drama and turmoil. Coretti frequently noticed her husband was spending long periods away from home and whenever he returned, she tormented him with questions. She soon learned that the majority of the family strongly disapproved of the marriage, not so much on account of Coretti's color but for general social reasons. The arguments eventually culminated with divorce, especially as Utin was constantly under pressure to do so from his family. That fall, as her marriage fell apart, Coretti enrolled at St. Petersburg's Imperial Musical Conservatory (now the Rimsky-Korsakov Conservatory) for intense musical and voice culture training under Professor Elisabeth F. Zwanziger, whom she'd also receive private lessons from as well. For a woman, despite a ten-year residence in Russia, could hardly read in the Russian language. This made it difficult to understand how she was able to secure a position in such a prestigious school. However she was able attend one of Russia's major educational institutions, she likely paid well for her musical education, as she continued appearing around Petrograd as an entertainer. While studying at the conservatory, she was soon introduced to an esteemed member of the Petrograd Conservatory and popular pianist, Nikolai Burenin, and it wasn't long before he offered her an interesting proposition in joining his latest venture, the Society of Fine Arts. Burenin and fellow pianist (and director of the St. Petersburg Theater of Musical Drama) Mikhail Bichter organized the Society in 1911 under the League of Education and received permission in early 1913 from E.P. Karpov (chief director of Imperial Theaters) to turn the organization into an independent society with its own charters. The organization was divided into four sections: Musical, Dramatic, Literary and Artistic (sculpture and painting). The musical section, headed by Burenin, consisted of more than a hundred singers, pianists, violinists, cellists, musicologists and professors from the St. Petersburg Conservatory. Around the Russian capital, the Society arranged ‚Äúliterary & musical mornings‚Äù, which gathered large audiences of five to six hundred people consisting of workers and peasants. The carefully organized program promoted the best works of Russian romance, folk and classical music such as the works of Glinka, Tchaikovsky and Glazunov. The majority of the public concerts were usually held in the hall of the Tenishev Secondary School (at 33-35 Mokhovaya) as well as at the Zemsky School, Worker's Clubs and the Labor Exchange. Touring with the Society of Fine Arts, Coretti soon discovered that she was performing before audiences of revolutionaries who used the concerts as fronts for their anti-government meetings. A significant part of the income from the paid concerts went to the Bolshevik party. Through the underground revolutionary Burenin, Coretti was introduced to Countess Sofia V. Panina, F.I. Drabkina, V.V. Gordeeva, A.I. Mashirov and many other revolutionary actors, composers, musicians, artists and writers. From her new Bolshevik acquaintances, she became more familiar with the unrelenting fury and brutality of the Tsarist gendarmerie and Okhrana (secret police) upon the lower classes. The leaders of the proletariat were shadowed, hunted and sent to rot in distant Siberian prisons for their illegal underground activities. From late April to early May 1914, the underground Bolshevik newspaper, Path of Truth, announced the \\"Literary & Musical evenings\\" at the Ligovsky People's House, located on 63 Tambovskaya Lane, on Petrograd's outer edges near the numerous factories and industrial plants. It was there every night, as the band struck up the music, Coretti emerged upon the makeshift stage inside the industrial plant. Before a backdrop of a blue sky and endless grain fields, Coretti, clothed in a tattered dress and carrying a sickle, began singing a lamentable song of anguish, pain, and suffering which was so dramatic and powerful that it touched the hearts of every worker in the audience that night. However, Coretti soon discovered that she'd performed for a roomful of revolutionaries who used the concerts as fronts for their anti-government meetings. Through Burenin, Coretti was introduced to many other revolutionary actors, composers, musicians, artists and writers. From her new Bolshevik acquaintances, she became more familiar with the unrelenting fury and brutality of the Tsarist gendarmerie and Okhrana (secret police) upon the lower classes. The leaders of the proletariat were shadowed, hunted and sent to rot in distant Siberian prisons for their illegal underground activities. On June 28, 1914, Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo, setting in motion the events leading to the outbreak of World War I. On August 4, the German Army advanced upon Belgium in response. Immediately afterward: \\"Because of the aggressive attitude of the German government, France, Great Britain, and its Allies have declared a general mobilisation.\\" Throughout the Russian Empire, the war was greeted with an eruption of patriotic fervor. Posters appeared everywhere, calling every able-bodied man to help defend their country. Men were seen standing in long lines to enlist (or to answer the draft), boys were boarded into trucks heading for their local regiment bases. On every street corner stood a soldier. That summer, Russia entered a period of unprecedented bloody savagery which would last for seven years and claim the lives of more than ten million people. No other country paid the price for the folly of 1914 as Russia did. Since the outbreak of the war, Russia's lack of arms and ammunition was quite apparent. The shortages became so severe that soldiers were sent to the front without guns and ordered to look for them amongst the dead. Many soldiers didn't even have boots. The officer corps, half of which were noblemen, suffered terrible losses in the first battles against the Germans. In the early months of the war, many families began following the action closely on a large map of Europe. Most men were away fighting on the front lines, eventually even Emma Harris' husband was somewhere fighting in the trenches, leaving the women and children behind alone in the villages and cities. Caring for the sick and wounded soldiers became a popular way for noblewomen to do their part for the war effort. Although most of their motives were honest and sincere, there were some elements of vanity and rivalry among the aristocratic women to see who could house, feed and care for the soldiers more splendidly than the rest. Other nobles, such as the Sheremetevs', converted several of their properties into hospitals, organized shipments of relief packages to Russian prisoners of war, helped bandage the wounded at private infirmaries and formed organizations dedicated to helping war orphans. On September 1, the Tsar declared that St. Petersburg would be known as Petrograd. In the Petrograd, high society was basking in what would be Russia's last spectacular year and to be Russian society's greatest season. There was a feverish desire to have a good time to combat the undercurrent of nervousness. All of Petrograd indulged in wild partying, amusement and merrymaking before the Tsarist government initiated prohibition that November (alcohol was to banned for the remainder of the war). One highlight of the year was Countess Shuvalov's black and white ball, with the uniformed Chevalier Gardes in attendance. Everyone spent their evenings out at the opera and attending parties. At popular restaurants, everyone danced the tango and downing champagne to the wailing of gypsy singers, red-clad Romanian violinists, and clinking glasses. People were spending money as quickly as they could because they weren't sure what was to happen next. Early 1915, the Fine Arts Society appeared at the Women's Medical Institute where they offered a heavily censored concert for the wounded soldiers. Other Russian performers included monarchist, chauvinistic, anti-Jewish and anti-Armenian jokes and songs in their programs, much to the disgust of Burenin. The society soon began subtly including anti-war and pro-Bolshevik propaganda into their programs. Quickly, the hospital administration caught on and began issuing warnings. However, after the third concert, the Society was barred from appearing in war hospitals and infirmaries after a warrant was issued by the Okhrana. Around this time, during a trip to Finland, Coretti met the discreet, well-mannered young blond-haired pianist Boris Borisovich Titz. The Titz family, with origins traced back to Bavaria, made their way to Russia when concert artist, Augustus Dietz toured Russia in 1771. Augustus received an offer to remain in St. Petersburg as a member of Tsarina Catherine's Imperial court orchestra, where he amassed a huge fortune. Over the years, the Dietz family name eventually developed into Titz. Like most bourgeoisie families, the Titz's valued education, particularly musical education to continue their reputation as a noted musical family. On October 29, 1890, Boris Borisovich was born to Anna Vasilievna and Boris Nikolaevich Titz on the family estate in the village Vysh-Gorodishche deep in the Tver province, just northwest of Moscow. He was the third of four children, Olga (1880), Natalia (1885) and Alexey (1895). By 1900, the family left Vysh-Gorodishche for St. Petersburg where they resided at 36 V.O. ya Liniya 3 on Vasilyevsky Island. The Island was center of the majority of St. Petersburg's scientific and other educational institutions. The early 20th century brought about an active housing construction boom on boom as new buildings, particularly industrial plants were constantly appearing. In 1908, months before Boris graduated from the Karl Marx School (and receiving a gold medal), Boris Nikolaevich Titz died suddenly on March 23, 1908 and after a funeral at St. Andrew's Cathedral was buried later at Smolensk Orthodox Necropol. Immediately afterward, the family's fortune quickly began to dwindle away. The following year, as young Boris enrolled himself into the Law facility of the St. Petersburg Imperial University, where he began offering private Math and Latin lessons for classmates in order to pay for his classes. He completed his full University course in 1912 with his thesis ‚ÄúPeculiarities of protection of possession under Russian Law‚Äù. Since he showed a keen interest in music and singing since childhood, instead of pursuing a career in law, he immediately afterwards he enrolled into the esteemed St. Petersburg Imperial Musical Conservatory, where he studied piano under professor Anna Nikolaevna Esipova until his graduation three years later in 1914. After graduating from the conservatory, he found work around Petrograd as a pianist, and supplemented his income by offering piano lessons at his apartment at 20, V.O. ya Liniya 9. Not long after the two met, Coretti and Boris' mutual sympathy grew into a deep feeling and two quickly began dating. By June 1915, Coretti had graduated from the Conservatory, although she continued receiving private musical lessons from Professor Zwanziger and an Italian woman named Geraldini. Meanwhile, she had possibly more-or-less returned to performing around Petrograd with the Fine Arts Society. Throughout the summer, Russian officers found themselves wasting scarce artillery shells on their own troops in a desperate attempt to get them to fight. So dreadful were the conditions at the front, that many soldiers shot off their own fingers to escape the carnage. Many began to desert and return to their villages, which had been nearly drained of men. That same summer at Moscow's Aquarium Garden, Afro-American businessman Frederick Thomas sold tobacco sending the proceeds to the troops. Elsewhere, bazaars were organized to sell items to raise money for the troops. Despite being deprived of access to military hospitals, the Society continued offering stage shows in the working class districts of Petrograd. Soon, with the assistance of actress Maria Fyodorovna Andreeva, the Fine Arts Society began staging performances at the Putilov factory. In between her performances, Coretti began to notice the audiences whispering amongst each other of their hatred of autocracy and the senseless imperialist war. In September, Tsar Nikolai II made the disastrous decision to replace Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich and assume supreme command of Russia's armed forces. From that point onwards, the military's mounting failures were blamed solely on the tsar. With the tsar off at the front, Tsarina Alexandra, along with the mysterious holy man Rasputin, took command of the government. Rasputin's murky influence and the negative public perception of the German-born Tsarina as an enemy spy fed talk of dark forces at work that destroyed Russian society's waning trust in the Romanovs. Everywhere, pamphlets were distributed claiming: \\"To be for the Tsar is to be against Russia!\\" Everyone, even Imperial family members, begged Tsar Nikolai for change and reforms to allow society a greater voice in the government, although it was likely to late by then to halt the drift towards revolution. Society's lack of trust in the government was matched by the government's distrust of the people. Convinced that the people, particularly the bourgeoisie, presented a grave threat to the crown, the Okhrana kept surveillance on the wealthy. Private homes were being monitored for subversive activities. The government feared many aristocratic women were inviting military officers in their salons and encouraging seditious talk. Government agents believed the elite's alienation from the throne a more serious threat than the one posed by the poor and disenfranchised. Many aristocrats found life in the city burdensome and many retreated to their country estates. Early 1916, the Fine Arts Society organized a concert held at the Tenishev School, with the participation of Maxim Gorky who gave a fiery propaganda filled speech despite the presence of the secret police. A financially successful author, playwright and editor, Gorky (born Alexei Peshkov in 1868) was well noted for publicly opposing the Tsar, exposing the Tsarist government's control of the press and had been arrested and even exiled on numerous occasions. He supported liberal appeals to the government for civil rights and social reform. He was personal friend of Lenin since 1902, and was acquainted with many revolutionaries. His reputation grew as a literary voice of Russia's bottom strata of society and a fervent advocate of social, political and cultural transportation. Gorky also had a passionate love of the theater. One of his aspirations since the 1890s, was to develop a network of provincial theaters for the peasants in hopes to reform Russia's theatrical world. In 1904, he was able to open a theater in his hometown of Nizhny Novgorod, but unfortunately the government censors banned every play that he proposed and Gorky abandoned the project. On December 31, 1913, after the Romanov Tercentenary, Gorky was allowed to return home Russia after eight years of living in exile in Italy. By March 1914, he was living in St. Petersburg working as an editor for the underground Bolshevik Zvezda and Pravda newspapers. After the concert, Burenin introduced Coretti to Gorky, who confessed to her that despite his disdain for female entertainers, he was her biggest fan, expressing that her Negro folk songs captured the essence of the struggles of the proletariat. Gorky and Coretti became close friends, and she may been a frequent guest at his Petrograd apartment on 23 Kronversky Avenue where there was constant drinking, dancing, gambling and frequent readings of 18th Century pornographic novels (Marquis de Sade was rather popular). During these nights at Gorky's home, Coretti would've mingled with publishers, academics, revolutionaries, the great singer Fyodor Chaliapin and even Lenin himself. By mid-1916, while the mood was falling in the country, the feverish atmosphere began to penetrate into the entertainment that civilians and military were looking for. On the eve of the war came from Argentina, flew to Paris and sped around the world a new dance fashion, the Tango. During the war years, the popularity of tango increased; however, some professional dancers and singers brought ominous notes to his elegant, stylized eroticism. One couple became famous for their \\"Tango of Death\\", in which a man, as usual dressed in a flawless tail coat, was made up in such a way that his face looked like a skull. It was a melodramatic echo of the gloomy news coming from the fronts. As the year came to an end, with millions of peasants sent off to the front, food shortages loomed over Russia and the rapid increase in the price of goods fueled larger and more frequent strikes in the cities. The shortage of fuel and electricity also forced the Russian government to declare that theaters must observe part-time work ‚Äì from eight o'clock in the evening until midnight. The emotional incontinence that the Russians were looking for in tango during the war, and the emotional growth they received from vodka and wine, found a new blood relative in drugs, primarily in cocaine. In certain urban circles, cocaine has become the most preferred path to euphoric oblivion in the face of intractable problems raging around. The gendarmes were becoming reluctant to repel the masses of protesters, instead many policemen began joining the crowds, shouting: \\"Down with the War!\\" Once, while Grand Duchess Xenia's automobile drove through the streets of Petrograd, a group of street kids chased the car and pelted it with snowballs, yelling, \\"Down with the filthy bourgeoisie!\\" On the night of December 16, a group of men led by Prince Felix Yusupov murdered Rasputin in an attempt to free Russia from his mysterious influence. Profoundly shaken by his death, the Tsar and his family retreated into seclusion. Petrograd became a massive lunatic asylum, discontent rising with each day. The dire food shortages, combined with the 300% inflation left Russia on the brink of revolution on the part of the lower class. On March 8 (O.S. February 23), 1917, over seven thousand female textile workers from St. Petersburg's Vyborg district, marched through the streets crying for bread. The shortages had left the lower class starving, cold and desperate. Banners were erected everywhere, denouncing both the war and the Tsar. The crowds began breaking shops windows and raiding bakeries. Before the day ended, as many as ninety thousand had marched through the streets before order was restored. The revolution, however, had just begun. Throughout the night, Bolshevik revolutionaries organized further strikes and marches into the city center. The following morning, more than three hundred thousand workers from the northern outlying neighborhoods, crossed the Neva river at Alexandrovsky Bridge where they pushed through several hundred Cossacks on their way towards Nevsky Prospect. The city's fine inner-city neighborhoods had not seen such chaos since the 1905 revolution. By February 26, Cossacks patrolled the streets and machine guns were positioned everywhere. Street gatherings were banned and residents were warned that the authorities were ordered to confront any unrest with force. Despite these measures, protesters filled the streets only to be met by gunfire. All the blood spilling in the streets caused many soldiers to mutiny and join the mobs. By March 12, half of the city's 160,000-man garrison had joined the revolutionaries. Prisoners across the city were released into the streets, gendarmes were murdered, courthouses, arsenals, shops, private homes and the Ministry of the Interior were looted and ransacked. Mobs killed any respectable-looking men, causing many gendarmes to strip their uniforms and flee the city. At the Mariinsky Palace, government ministers met to resign from their positions before slipping out of Petrograd by nightfall. Towards the end of the day, a red flag was raised above the Winter Palace. The capital was now under Bolshevik control. On March 16, Tsar Nikolai abdicated and as their world dissolved around them, many aristocrats fled to the countryside. The old order evaporated and anarchy spread. While the Duma met at Tauride Palace to consider how to address the chaos, a rival political power, the Petrograd Soviet of Workers & Soldiers Deputies, held a meeting in the palace's right wing. The new provincial government, in order to win the support of the Soviet and it's the leader, Vladimir Lenin, agreed to amnesty for all political prisoners, freedom of speech, press, and assembly. They also agreed to the abolition of all restrictions based on race, class, religion, and nationality. The Okhrana and corps de Gendarmes was also to be abolished. The Bolsheviks began attacking the Burzh√∫i (bourgeoisie), or anyone classified as privileged. All it took was a starched white shirt, smooth hands, eyeglasses, a woman's hairstyle or even any evidence of bathing could classify a person as Burzh√∫i, causing an angry mob to set upon you. After the February Revolution and with Russia in a dire situation, Coretti's Russian career was suddenly interrupted and she pondered at the idea of returning to America. The war and revolution had abruptly ended Russia's importance on the continental theatrical circuit. Extensive touring was impossible and many Russian establishments began shutting down. The vast majority of the African-American community in Russia were rushing to Petrograd's American Embassy and Moscow's Consulate to apply for passports in order to sail across the Black Sea towards Turkey and Romania or board Trans-Siberian trains towards Manchuria and Japan in their journey back to America. However, letters she received from friends such as Ollie Burgoyne and Ida Forcyne who had returned home to America, she was able to learn about the changes in the American entertainment scene. The majority of Black establishments only wanted light-skinned Negro women, Harlem cabarets had women perform shake dances in between the tables and mingle with the audiences as Jazz wailed in the background. Such activities didn't happen in Russian cabarets and music halls. Most of the successful Negro performers returning to America from Europe, found themselves suddenly penniless and turning to domestic work. By May, Russia was already adapting to the country's new political reality, although most activities continued as before. Although it was noted at every prestigious venue, the 19th-century opera \\"A Life of the Tsar\\" was hastily dropped from the repertoire. That month, Boris's younger brother, Alexey Borisovich, had graduated from the Imperial University and immediately began packing. He decided to head south to the Ukraine, so he could continue his studies and was bringing along his wife, Lidiya Aleksandrovna Zelenina and their one-year-old son Alexey Aleksiyovich. However, Boris‚Äô sister, Natalia was to remain in the city with her lawyer husband, Vasily Nechaev and look after their mother. In September 1917, Boris and Coretti finally Petrograd's chaotic atmosphere for the quiet merchant city of Kharkov. Unfortunately, like every other Russian city, everything there was scarce. Everywhere, there were long lines just to receive small amounts of bread, sugar, kerosene and even shoes. To make matters worse, the hungry residents began blaming the local Jews for all of their problems. The Jewish community were blamed for all the missing goods, robberies and violence around the city. By the fall of 1917, proclamations appeared everywhere declaring for the restoration of order and the pogroms of all merchants and Jews. Beginning September 26, massive drunken angry mobs swarmed the streets on a murderous spree for nearly a week. The local soldiers and gendarmes were soon unable to control the violence, until Major-General, Alexander Kurilko, declared martial law. For a short time, meetings and rallies were banned. Theaters, cinemas and stage shows were closed and a curfew was evoked. After the chaos finally dissipated, Boris began teaching at the new Conservatory. Meanwhile, in between performing with Mikhail Bichter's Philharmonic Society Orchestra, Coretti spent time across the street of the Conservatory at 66, Chernyshevskiy Prospekt, where architect Vladimir Pokrovsky often organized musical evenings in his apartment. After singing a few songs, she'd mingle amongst the other musicians and listen in on the disputes over the development of artistic scene of Ukraine. She was soon acquainted with artists R.M. Savin, M.A. Sharonov, architect M.F. Pokorny, cellist E. Belousov and composer K.K. Gorsky. On November 7, the Bolsheviks struck again in Petrograd. Two days earlier, having changed his appearance, Lenin left the temporary asylum in Finland and slipped into the capital; he managed to convince his comrades that it was time to take power. Red troops, coordinated by Leon Trotsky - a talented assistant of Lenin - occupied a number of strategic sites in the city. That night, the Bolshevik- led soldiers, sailors and factory workers attacked the Winter Palace, the former royal residence where the Provisional Government met. A small defense force in the palace, consisting of two or three junkers' mouths and a part of the women's battalion, was suppressed after several hours of confrontation. Bolsheviks arrested members of the government; Kerensky, who had become prime minister by that time, was able to escape by taking a car at the United States embassy. Most Kharkov residents knew nothing of the October Revolution due to the slow spread of news across the vast Russian landscape and local printers on strike. The following day, news finally on the Revolution arrived by telegram, before Petrograd telegraphs stopped working and Kharkov was cut off from the capital. By November 10, all communications with Moscow and Kiev were also cut off, leaving Kharkov completely alone. The city soon formed its own provisional government, the Military Revolutionary Committee, and armed soldiers were posted everywhere. =Ukraine (1918‚Äì1920)= On February 12, 1918, at Kharkov's Metropol hotel, the new Donetsk-Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic (DKR) was established under the leadership of Victor Andreevich Sergeev, mainly known as ‚ÄúComrade Artyom‚Äù. This new republic also included the cities of Lugansk, Yekaterinoslav and Krivoy Rog although Kharkov was named the capital of this new republic. On March 3, the newly formed Soviet Union backed out of the war after the signing of Brest-Litovsk Treaty. Ten days later, 30,000 German and Austrian troops marched into the Ukraine, by mid-March, the Germans were already in Odessa and the new puppet state became known as the Hetmanate. Having occupied the south of Russia, the Germans and Austrians established a puppet state in Ukraine, including Odessa, where 30 thousand of their military were stationed. It wasn't long before the Germans turned their attention towards Kharkov and began invading the DKR on March 18. On April 7, German troops entered Kharkov through Yekaterinoslavskaya street and seized control of all government buildings as the old DKR government fled to Lugansk. On May 3, curfews were imposed upon the city and movement was restricted. In stark contrast to dying Moscow, German-occupied Kharkov was in full swing. There was an abundance of military officers of all ranks roaming the streets and lounging at popular cafes and restaurants. The presence of the Germans marked the end of the reign of terror against the ‚Äúbourgeoisie,‚Äù which the Bolsheviks unleashed after the October coup. But not all Bolsheviks fled: some went underground and intended to expel the invaders and their local allies, leading a stubborn guerrilla war, which became part of everyday life in the Ukraine. The region became terribly dangerous, besides the Red Army attempting to push out the Germans, the Ukraine's notorious criminal gangs (their brazen behavior comparable to Chicago's gangsters) began a reign of terror with nightly burglaries and murders in the streets. On November 11, 1918, everything suddenly changed as the Germans surrendered to the Allies and the Great War finally ended. Soon after, the Germans began to liberate the territories they occupied, including Kharkov, as envisaged by the peace agreement. As the Red Army reestablished power in Kharkov before continuing forward to push out the White Army in a series of difficult battles, Coretti and Boris were quickly engaged with the newly formed \\"Concert Brigade of the South-Western Front\\", that organized musical performances in theatres, libraries, nightclubs, mines, factories, hospitals and Red Army military camps across the Ukraine. On January 3, 1919, the Red Army reclaimed Kharkov who then immediately reestablished the DKR government. However, on February 17, upon the suggestion of Lenin, the DKR was dissolved and merged back with Ukrainian Soviet Republic. The Kharkov branch of the Soviet Cheka (secret police), which had formed in December 1917, was finally put to use, whose first orders were to establish a concentration camp in the city for bourgeoisie prisoners. That summer, Ukraine became turbulent and tense due to the raging Civil War. On July 5, with the situation of the Southern Front of the Russian Civil War drastically in favor of the White Army, Coretti witnessed General Anton Denikin‚Äôs capture of Kharkov as he advanced north towards Moscow. This was followed by looting and terror by the Bolshevik supporters. Meanwhile, the following month, Coretti found herself entertaining nightly at the Grotzsk Garden Theatre on 17 Ekaterinoslavskaya street, just 20 minutes away from the old Zerkalo Zhizni cinema that was once owned by Emma Harris just five years earlier. In 1920, as the Russian Civil War dragged to a halt and some sort of order was finally being brought to the Ukraine, all major Ukrainian theatrical and operatic companies were nationalized and Soviet approved performances were being produced, particularly at the old Kharkov Opera House. Built in 1829, the old Kharkov Opera located on Rymarskaya Street 21, with its French Renaissance decorated auditorium (imitating the Tuileries Palace), staged a remarkable production of Verdi‚Äôs Aida, with Coretti performing the lead role. The Ukrainians felt her role echoed Coretti‚Äôs own reality ‚Äì an Egyptian captive, a Negro slave, who threw off the shackles of slavery in the name of love as around the same time, after years of courtship and refusing his previous four marriage proposals, Coretti and Boris had finally married. She had been reluctant to follow through with the marriage, as she had aspirations of opening a children's vocal school in America. However, Boris informed her of the United States‚Äô widespread fear of Bolshevism, anarchism and communism. American newspapers were frequently reporting about mass trials and arrests, also Boris reminded her of how difficult it would be for a Negro woman to open a major establishment in the United States. Coretti also told him of how her first marriage fell apart, yet Boris promised that not all men were the same. He wouldn't allow anyone to interfere with their private lives and reminded her that he loved her no matter what color her skin was, that the human soul didn't depend on skin color. Fortunately, his family and friends quickly accepted his new wife. =Soviet career and the introduction of jazz (1921‚Äì1940)= In the summer of 1921, with the Great Famine raging across the USSR, the newlyweds relocated north to the new Soviet capital of Moscow. The couple resided at Poluektov Pereulok 7, were they shared a communal kitchen with the Duchenne family. The family, especially seven-year-old Igor, enjoyed hearing Coretti's voice ring throughout the apartment. Often Coretti would babysit young Igor Duchenne, who would bring her books from the Library of the USSR Academy of Sciences despite the fact she had a poor grasp of Russian. So instead, she'd cradle him in her arms and rock him to sleep singing, ‚ÄúSleep my Boy‚Äù (‚ÄúSpi, moy mal‚Äôchik‚Äù - I. Dunaevsky & Lebedev-Kumach). Unable to tour as the famine spread, Coretti decided to continue her studies by enrolling at the Tchaikovsky Conservatory's Opera Studio,The Collected Works of Langston Hughes ‚Äî University of Missouri Press, 2001. ‚Äî P. 69. which was under the direction of Mikhail Mikhailovich Ippolitov-Ivanov. She spent her days studying under Varvara Mikhailovna Zarudna and Nadezhda Ignatyevna Kalnin-Gandolfi. In late 1923, shortly after graduation, Coretti began appearing in Leningrad at Boris Pronin's Mansard Club. Early 1924, due to the harsh Russian winter, Boris and Coretti traveled south to Tbilisi to pay Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov a visit. Appearing slim and elegant in her bright colored shawl, Coretti lounged on their dining room sofa speaking in a flurry of English to her old teacher, Varvara, who affectionately called her Koretinka. On April 3, Coretti debuted at Moscow's infamous Bolshoi Theater opening with a remarkable three-day engagement, performing of several arias from Aida followed by numerous classical numbers written by famous Russian composers. The second half of the program primarily consisted of Negro songs (mostly hymns) performed in her dramatic lyrical soprano voice. This major performance, her first in Russia since 1917, was met with great enthusiasm and numerous standing ovations. With this success, Coretti hoped to continue performing as an operatic singer, but unfortunately Russian music critics felt she was better suited as a concert artist. After her final performance at the Bolshoi, she departed for Leningrad with a contract for two concerts and a string of engagements across the provinces. In November, returning home from an appearance in the Ukraine, she was writing extensively to W.E.B. du Bois, who had heard of her triumph at the Bolshoi and expressed his plans for a visit to the Ukraine. Coretti asked du Bois to send her sheet music of popular American music which were to acquire in the Soviet Union and also put him in contact with her mother to cover the costs as she was unable to send money from Moscow. In April 1925, the couple were performing in Tver, near the village of Vysh-Gorodishche, where Boris was born and where the old Titz estate sat crumbling since the revolution. In October, Coretti and pianist E. Lutsky signed a 20-concert contract with the State Philharmonic Orchestra for across the Northern Caucasus and the Ukraine with a program consisting of Russian composers such as Spendiarov, Vasilenko, Glazunov, Gnesin and also including compositions from Afro-American composers such as Barley, Cook and others. This was first of many extensive tours (1924-1940) across the Soviet Union under the State Philharmonic Society. Opening on December 7 in Rostov-on-Don, the group traversed across Melitopol, Krasnodar, Simferopol and Yevpatoria. Letters home to friends, Coretti mentioned how much she loved traveling to the sea, although during her engagement in Evpatoria she complained about the city's stuffiness and how impossible it was to find anything suitable to drink. She also mentions her distress with working with the Philharmonic orchestra as she felt wasn't benefitting from her performances and felt they didn't appreciate her talents as a concert artist. In late-February 1926, Frank Withers (n√© Frank Douglas Withers; 1880‚Äì1952), and his Jazz Kings band (featuring Sidney Bechet) arrived in Moscow, where they received a whirlwind of success upon opening at the Cinema Malaya Dimitrova. Known as the ‚ÄòPalace of the Silver Screen‚Äô, the popular cinema opened new Hollywood films there each week to packed audiences and when the Jazz Kings opened there on February 22, the cinema was packed before the first note sounded and couples took to the aisles to dance the Charleston. When Coretti and the Philharmonic Orchestra returned from their Ukrainian tour, the Jazz Kings were making appearances at the Hall of Writers and the Moscow Conservatory. The Philharmonic Orchestra quickly organized a month-long Ukrainian tour for the Jazz Kings, with Coretti as their lead performer, giving her the opportunity to reap from the success jazz was creating in the Soviet Union. In May, the group played a week in Kharkov, two successful weeks in Kiev and a final week in Odessa at the Letnem Theatre, before the Jazz Kings returned to Germany. In July, Coretti was engaged in Leningrad for a week at the Recreation Gardens before returning to the Ukraine in September for an engagement in Ekaterinoslav. The year ended rather interestingly, as she was appearing in a Jewish Music Concert held at the Tchaikovsky Conservatory's Small Hall, where she demonstrated her skill performing traditional Jewish songs the Yiddish language. During the summer of 1927, during a Caucasus tour, Coretti debuted in July onstage in the city of Baku, where she was advertised as the woman who introduced jazz to Azerbaijan despite newspapers not indicating any jazz numbers in her repertoire during her appearance there, although she did perform a number in the Azeri language. On December 11, in the famous Grand Hall of the Leningrad Philharmonic, Coretti accompanied the ‚ÄòFirst Concert Jazz Band‚Äô led by Leopold Teplitsky and composed of about 15 people (2 violins, banjo, grand piano, tuba, trumpets, clarinets, saxophones, trombones and, of course, a great set of percussion instruments). Coretti, quite tall, lush, in an open green silk dress with a pelerine, perfectly in harmony with her golden brown skin, sang in English with a strong, rather low voice of a very beautiful timbre. The concert was unusual for that time. The hall was literally bursting with the public, barely getting the entrance tickets, stood all the time in the gallery, walking along the perimeter of the hall. In 1928, after recording several songs in Moscow, Coretti began a four-year tour, appearing in Ukraine, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Georgia, Armenia and frequent appearances deep in Siberia. Although she performed jazz, she usually reverted to singing in Russian or Negro spirituals. On January 29, 1929, she began the year performing at the Karl Marx Club in Minsk, just beside the border leading outside the Soviet Union towards Poland. Four months later, after a lengthy tour across the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic and other Central Asian countries, she returned west to the Ukraine, appearing in Vinnytsia on May 7. Early July, Coretti and Boris received permission to depart the Soviet Union for a four-month Latvian tour. She was set to perform just outside the Latvian capital of Riga in the seaside resort town of J≈´rmala. 18 years since her last engagement there. The town had become a popular tourist destination for Soviet officials and top union members. In the Edinburgh neighborhood posters and newspapers advertised Coretti's debut at the Sommertheater on July 11, where she performed alongside Georgs Vla≈°eks and his Orpheans Orchestra for the Edinburgh Sea Festival for a successful week. The following month, on August 12, Coretti and Boris appeared onstage together at Riga's Palladium Kino where she performed beautiful Italian arias, several German and Russian folk songs and ending the program with her Negro folk songs (which consisted of Negro spirituals, Jazz and Blues). She also made subsequent evening appearances on Radio-Latvia reaching other parts of the small country. After a month of unreported activity, Coretti resumed her tour, appearing in the seaside towns of Jelgava and Windau (now Ventspils) before returning home to Moscow early November for an engagement at the Polytechnic Museum. In 1930, she participated in a jazz revue led by Simon Kagan. Sometime early 1932, the Titz household had relocated to 15, Savelevski Pereulok, where they inhabited apartment #11, two small dingy rooms on the third floor in Moscow's Western section near Kropotkinskaya Square. On June 26, Emma Harris, Coretti Arle Titz, actor Bob Ross and engineer Robert Robinson gathered at Nikolayevsky Station to welcome twenty two Afro-American artists (including Langston Hughes) that were invited the Soviet Union to produce a film depicting Negro laborers in their difficult working conditions in the American South. The film, was based on Vladimir Mayakovsky's 1925 poem, Black & White, which protested American racism and imperialism. The film was sponsored by the Comintern and was to be produced by the Russo-German film company Meschrabpom. The following year, recorded two spiritual records - \\"Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child\\" and \\"Little David Play on Your Harp\\". On March 29, 1934, Coretti celebrated her tenth year on the Soviet stage with a radio concert at the Moscow Radio-Theater with many other Soviet entertainers. The radio broadcast reached as far as Paris where it was praised by the French press. After the assassination of Sergei Mironovich Kirov, Stalin's assumed successor, on December 1, 1934, life became much more oppressed within the Soviet Union. Early 1935, Coretti and developed close relationships with Paul Robeson and Marian Anderson as they toured across the Soviet Union. In May 1936, Coretti appeared in the film Circus in the minor role as the nanny of the little black son of the heroine of the film Marion Dixon (Lyubov Orlova), before returning to her usual touring. =Later career (1941‚Äì1951)= On June 22, 1941, Germany invaded the USSR. Coretti survived the German invasion of Russia, with Hitler's army arrested only 44 miles (71 km) from Moscow. She organized an anti-air-raid squad on the roof of her apartment building and nursed ailing soldiers at Hospital No. 5012. On December 5, the Red Army brought all its might into German positions causing the Wehrmacht to hastily withdraw. This marked the prelude to many victories for the Red Army. Despite the war, on December 7, at the Maly Theatre, the All-Union Tour Association organized a concert revue of English and American Music & Songs. Honored Artist of the USSR, F. Petrova sang \\"Cowboy from Texas\\" and \\"Matrosskaya\\". This was followed by Coretti's successful performance, introducing Muscovites to the vocal works of English composers Purcell, Balfi, Quelter and American composers Johnson and Laurent. In 1942, as World War II raged, Coretti and her husband made concert tours to Ivanovo, Nizhny Novgorod (at the time called Gorky), Kazan and other cities, performing spirituals on the front lines or singing before injured in field hospitals until Boris resumed work at the Conservatory despite the war conditions. Coretti wrote with admiration: ‚Äú... The school works at full speed; teachers are once again fond of him.‚Äù In 1945, the war was still raging, the majority of the theaters were closed and very few films were being produced. Around February, director Vasily M. Zhuravlev gathered the most talented actors of the USSR at Moscow's Gorky Soyuzdetfilm Studio to film Jules Vernes‚Äô ‚ÄúFifteen Year Old Captain‚Äù. Mikhail Astangov, Osip Abdulov, Alexander Khvylya, Pavel Sukhanov, Vsevolod Larionov, Elena Izmaylova, Sergey Tsenin, Viktor Kulakov, Ivan Bobrov, Weyland Rudd and Mme. Arle-Titz were all honored artists, and despite the small budget and the majority of the actors being constantly preoccupied with other engagements, the film was predicted to be the biggest hit of the year. Shooting resumed in mid-May shortly after Victory Day, where the first scenes were between Coretti and the six-year-old Azarik Messerer. Under the blinding lights, young Azarik drifted asleep underneath a heavy blanket while Coretti, in the role of the black nanny named Nan, sang a beautiful Russian lullaby. To the entire film crew, Coretti was treated like a prima donna, even the director was afraid to approach her. Despite being seen throughout the film, she only had one musical number as her grasp of the Russian language after all those years was still poor. In June, the cast traveled to Georgia to film the African scenes on the Black Sea coast for eight months. Two-thirds of the film was shot on Primorsky Boulevard in Batumi and in the vicinity of the city, Tsihis-Dziri and Adzharis-Tskhali. On the beach was built the African village \\"Kazonde\\" as on screen, Transcaucasia's nature created a complete illusion of African nature. While in Batumi, since her only scene was already shot, Coretti preoccupied her time Azarik, improving his poor table manners and teaching him how to properly hold a knife and fork. After fourteen months of filming 15 kilometres of film, the ‚ÄúFifteen Year Old Captain‚Äù was finally released on March 18, 1946, immediately conquering the hearts of children and adults across the Soviet Union. In 1947, after forty-years years of intense and continuous work, the forces of Arle-Titz were undermined, newspapers reported that her voice became worn out and lost its former beauty and full-soundness. Although it may have been that the Soviet Union's music industry finally decided to shelf its once-popular black prima donna. Which explains why after the war, she was no longer mentioned in Soviet news, as she was living quietly in Moscow until her death, December 14, 1951. After the death and cremation of Coretti Henrichovna Arle-Titz on December 14, 1951, Boris Borisovich turned to Varvara Mikhailovna Zarudnaya's niece, Vera Nikolaevna, with a request for the temporary burial of the urn with the ashes of his wife next to her close friend, composer Ippolitov-Ivanov. Coretti Arle-Titz was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery on December 15, 1951, in the family grave of Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov and his wife, Varvara Mikhailovna Zarudnaya. In later years, Boris Borisovich did not have time to rebury the remains of Coretti, and after his death (in 1963) he was instead buried beside her.

It is in the oenotherae species group. It is likely a specialist pollinator of plants in the family Onagraceae. Cory S. Sheffield described the species in 2013 and named the specific name in honor of Noam Chomsky. Taxonomic history Royal Saskatchewan Museum entomologist Cory S. Sheffield wrote the species description for M. chomskyi in a 2013 paper in the journal ZooKeys. Sheffield concurrently published the specimen data via GBIF's Integrated Publishing Toolkit. All nineteen of the M. chomskyi specimens Sheffield based his description on were provided by Jack Neff of the Central Texas Melittological Institute. Neff and Allan W. Hook collected most of the specimens. In all there were two male specimens and seventeen female specimens: one male was designated the holotype, one female was designate an allotype, and the rest were designated paratypes. Neff had initially identified these specimen as all being M. amica. Sheffield placed M. chomskyi in the oenotherae species group of the subgenus Megachiloides, which also includes M. amica, M. oenotherae, and M. umatillensis. The specific name chomskyi honors Noam Chomsky. Sheffield wrote he commemorated Chomsky \\"for his many academic achievements and contributions as a linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, historian, political critic, activist and global champion of human rights and freedoms\\". Sheffield also has stated that he has been \\"a huge fan and follower of his writings, lectures, and political views for a long time\\". The magazine Science News included Megachile chomskyi in its list of \\"unusual new species names of 2013\\", and the Israeli newspaper Haaretz included this species in a 2016 article listing taxa named after Jews. Distribution M. chomskyi is found in the American state of Texas. The type locality, where the holotype was collected, is in Winkler County. Other counties specimens were collected include Ward County, Kleberg County, and Travis County. Collection areas included the Monahans Sandhills State Park on the border of Ward and Winkler Counties. Sheffield has suggested that the range might extend to Arizona and Kansas, raising the possibility that some specimens identified as M. amica might in fact be M. chomskyi. Description and diagnosis Tongues of: (d) M. amica; (e) M. chomskyi; (f) M. oenotherae; and (g) M. umatillensis. Species in the oenotherae group have long tongues, although M. chomskyi's tongue is not as long as those of M. umatillensis and M. oenotherae. Both sexes of M. chomskyi have a tongue length of , making it more than half the length of the body. For both sexes, the tongue's first palpomere is 55% the length of the second. M. chomskyi is most morphologically similar to M. amica. However, M. chomskyi are larger than M. amica and M. oenotherae so their body length can be used as a diagnostic. The body length is for males and for females. Males have a forewing length of while females have a forewing length of . The females of M. chomskyi and M. amica can also be distinguished by their hair. The dark pubescence on female M. chomskyi is composed entirely of short hair, whereas the dark hair on M. amica is of varied lengths. Biology C. hartwegii flowers (Hartweg's sundrops) Fifteen specimens of M. chomskyi were collected on the flowers of Calylophus hartwegii (Hartweg's sundrops, Hartweg evening primrose) and one was collected from the flowers of Oenothera drummondii. Sheffield suggests that, like other members of the oenotherae species group, M. chomskyi is oligolectic, exclusively pollinating plants in the family Onagraceae. The M. chomskyi specimens were collected as early as late April and as late as June. Conservation status In 2016, NatureServe gave M. chomskyi a conservation status of \\"GU\\", denoting they could not assign a conservation rank due to insufficient data. Genetics An analysis of the Cytochrome oxidase I gene showed a 7.8% difference between M. chomskyi and M. amica; each species had intraspecific variation of less than 0.8%.

A layer ‚Ñì ‚àí 1 is skipped over activation from ‚Ñì ‚àí 2. A residual neural network (ResNet) is an artificial neural network (ANN) of a kind that builds on constructs known from pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex. Residual neural networks do this by utilizing skip connections, or shortcuts to jump over some layers. Typical ResNet models are implemented with double- or triple- layer skips that contain nonlinearities (ReLU) and batch normalization in between. An additional weight matrix may be used to learn the skip weights; these models are known as HighwayNets. Models with several parallel skips are referred to as DenseNets. In the context of residual neural networks, a non-residual network may be described as a plain network. A reconstruction of a pyramidal cell. Soma and dendrites are labeled in red, axon arbor in blue. (1) Soma, (2) Basal dendrite, (3) Apical dendrite, (4) Axon, (5) Collateral axon. One motivation for skipping over layers is to avoid the problem of vanishing gradients, by reusing activations from a previous layer until the adjacent layer learns its weights. During training, the weights adapt to mute the upstream layer, and amplify the previously-skipped layer. In the simplest case, only the weights for the adjacent layer's connection are adapted, with no explicit weights for the upstream layer. This works best when a single nonlinear layer is stepped over, or when the intermediate layers are all linear. If not, then an explicit weight matrix should be learned for the skipped connection (a HighwayNet should be used). Skipping effectively simplifies the network, using fewer layers in the initial training stages. This speeds learning by reducing the impact of vanishing gradients, as there are fewer layers to propagate through. The network then gradually restores the skipped layers as it learns the feature space. Towards the end of training, when all layers are expanded, it stays closer to the manifold and thus learns faster. A neural network without residual parts explores more of the feature space. This makes it more vulnerable to perturbations that cause it to leave the manifold, and necessitates extra training data to recover.  Biological analogue  The brain has structures similar to residual nets, as cortical layer VI neurons get input from layer I, skipping intermediary layers. In the figure this compares to signals from the apical dendrite (3) skipping over layers, while the basal dendrite (2) collects signals from the previous and/or same layer.Some research indicates that there are additional structures here, so this explanation is somewhat simplified. Similar structures exists for other layers. How many layers in the cerebral cortex compare to layers in an artificial neural network is not clear, nor whether every area in the cerebral cortex exhibits the same structure, but over large areas they appear similar.  Forward propagation  For single skips, the layers may be indexed either as ell-2 to ell or as ell to ell+2. (Script ell used for clarity, usually it is written as a simple l.) The two indexing systems are convenient when describing skips as going backward or forward. As signal flows forward through the network it is easier to describe the skip as ell+k from a given layer, but as a learning rule (back propagation) it is easier to describe which activation layer you reuse as ell-k, where k-1 is the skip number. Given a weight matrix W^{ell-1,ell}for connection weights from layer ell-1 to ell, and a weight matrix W^{ell-2,ell} for connection weights from layer ell-2 to ell, then the forward propagation through the activation function would be (aka HighwayNets) : begin{align} a^ell & := mathbf{g}(W^{ell-1,ell} cdot a^{ell-1} + b^ell + W^{ell-2,ell} cdot a^{ell-2})  & := mathbf{g}(Z^ell + W^{ell-2,ell} cdot a^{ell-2}) end{align} where : a^ell the activations (outputs) of neurons in layer ell, : mathbf{g} the activation function for layer ell, : W^{ell-1,ell} the weight matrix for neurons between layer ell-1 and ell, and : Z^ell = W^{ell-1,ell} cdot a^{ell-1} + b^ell Absent an explicit matrix W^{ell-2,ell} (aka ResNets), forward propagation through the activation function simplifies to : a^ell := mathbf{g}(Z^ell + a^{ell-2}) Another way to formulate this is to substitute an identity matrix for W^{ell-2,ell}, but that is only valid when the dimensions match. This is somewhat confusingly called an identity block, which means that the activations from layer ell-2 are passed to layer ell without weighting. In the cerebral cortex such forward skips are done for several layers. Usually all forward skips start from the same layer, and successively connect to later layers. In the general case this will be expressed as (aka DenseNets) : a^ell := mathbf{g} left( Z^ell + sum_{k=2}^K W^{ell-k,ell} cdot a^{ell-k} right) .  Backward propagation  During backpropagation learning for the normal path : Delta w^{ell-1,ell} := -eta frac{partial E^ell}{partial w^{ell-1,ell}} = -eta a^{ell-1} cdot delta^ell and for the skip paths (nearly identical) : Delta w^{ell-2,ell} := -eta frac{partial E^ell}{partial w^{ell-2,ell}} = -eta a^{ell-2} cdot delta^ell. In both cases : eta a learning rate (eta < 0), : delta^ell the error signal of neurons at layer ell, and : a_i^ell the activation of neurons at layer ell. If the skip path has fixed weights (e.g. the identity matrix, as above), then they are not updated. If they can be updated, the rule is an ordinary backpropagation update rule. In the general case there can be K skip path weight matrices, thus : Delta w^{ell-k,ell} := -eta frac{partial E^ell}{partial w^{ell-k,ell}} = -eta a^{ell-k} cdot delta^ell As the learning rules are similar, the weight matrices can be merged and learned in the same step.

Clannic correspondence It has been recognised that the ethnic groups of the Kachin have corresponding clans. Among the Jinghpaw there are five main clans: the Maran, the Marip, the Nhkum, the Lahpai and the Lahtaw and in other ethnic groups, there are corresponding clans to the Jinghpaw ones, with the result that members of the two clans are seen as Kahpu-Kanau.Robinne, F.

Overview  Taiy≈ç no nai Machi is a proletarian novel by Sunao Tokunaga (1899‚Äì1958). It was first published in serialized form in the literary magazine Senki between June and November of 1929.  Background  The novel was partly inspired by Tokunaga's experiences being fired from his job at a printing company following his participation in a labour strike in 1926. He began writing the novel in 1928. Different accounts of the origins of the work were presented by Fusao Hayashi in his 1955 memoirs and Tokunaga himself in a 1930 essay. Literary historian Donald Keene places more trust in Hayashi's account, which is presented below. In the spring of 1929, Tokunaga presented an early manuscript to Hayashi, an acquaintance who was glad to assist the writing career of a truly working-class author. Hayashi was distressed about the writing style of the work, which resembled that of a popular magazine, but Tokunaga responded with the concern that proletarian readers would be unable to understand a work written in a more literary style. Hayashi nevertheless suggested Tokunaga rewrite the book, loaning him a copy of a Japanese translation of Fyodor Gladkov's 1925 novel Cement and recommending he follow Gladkov's writing style. Tokunaga admitted to Hayashi a few days later that he had read Cement but would be unable to mimic Gladkov's style. Hayashi offered to rewrite the opening to provide Tokunaga with a model, going on to completely rewrite the first ten or so pages and extensively revise the rest. After Tokunaga presented the completed work to Hayashi, Hayashi recommended it to the publishers of Senki.  Reception  Taiy≈ç no nai Machi was well received on initial publication, selling 40,000 copies and turning Tokunaga into the first writer of the proletarian movement whose book was so successful as to allow him to build a house on the proceeds. Contemporary proletarian writer Shigeharu Nakano praised the work as a rare well-written novel by a member of the working class. Keene called the work Tokunaga's \\"most important work\\". While noting that the work has been critically acclaimed, Keene himself dismisses it as \\"not a good novel\\" relying on \\"stock types\\" of characters being placed in \\"implausibly melodramatic situations.\\" = Translations = The work was translated into German in 1930 and Russian in 1932, before going on to appear in several other European languages.

History  Pottery is one of the oldest areas of handicraft in Azerbaijan. This art appeared in the Neolithic Age. In ancient times women dominated this craft. In the Eneolite Age this became an independent art as a result of technical advances.http://anl.az/down/meqale/sherq/2011/may/172376.htm The Ethnography of Azerbaijan encyclopedia shows that pottery development accelerated from the end of the Middle Ages. The invention of foot-powered wheels increased the number of kinds of pottery products and the establishment of pottery centers. Demand for pottery products created favourable conditions for earthenware products. These products spread across Azerbaijan. Unglazed and glazed products were both made. At the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth century, the use of domestic ceramics was more developed. Potters were primarily many clay products for use as water vessels, cookware, etc. Domestic pottery products were divided into several groups according to their usage. Water vessels pitchers, pots, jugs, vessels, doliums, carafes and mugs. Other earthenware products were used for washing and performing wudu. = Nakhchivan = During the Nakhchevan Khanate the workshop belonging to Ehsan Khan of Nakhchivan produced earthenware pitchers. Earthenware products were also produced in Shamakhi, Ardabil, Tabriz, Ganja and other cities. Clay dishes were produced in several villages of Sheki Khanate, especially in Nukha. = Baku = Pottery was also developed in Baku. The outskirts of the city were rich with clay, creating favourable production conditions. Bowls, plates and other artefacts from the seventeenth century were found there. = Karabakh = Pottery production in Karabakh reached a high level after the Early Middle Ages. Earthenware products in those times were much more developed in comparison with earlier or later work in terms of production mechanisms and decorative elements. Ceramic water pipes, tile and decorative bricks began in that period. Mongol invasions caused heavy damage to pottery production along with other fields of handicrafts in Karabakh and in Azerbaijan as a whole. = Modern times = In modern times the pottery has three many lines: production of construction bricks; production of various clay dishes (tiles, clay pipe); production of faience and porcelain.  Types  Pottery patterns are different in size, shape, materials and technologies. Types include Boralƒ± ceramics, glossy ceramics, glazed ceramics, Basma- nakhƒ±shlƒ± ceramics and adhesion patterned ceramics. The different types were put to different applications: * Pottery without glaze - cubes, boilers, cakes, sticks, aftershocks, cabbage, milk containers, spinach, lamps, hookahs. * Pottery with glaze - drum, vase, vase, lamp, safe. In general, the glazed dishes in Karabakh were cooked in two stages: first, they cook the product in an ordinary way and take them out the fire, then made it with glaze, pushed back to cook. * Construction materials - The glazed materials and ceramic mosaic were widely used during the construction of the Karabakh palace, caravanserai and baths.

Hosted by University of Santo Tomas, the FEU Tamaraws defeated the back-to-back defending champions UE Warriors in the finals taking their ninth overall UAAP men's basketball championship. Finals The 1976 FEU Tamaraws, UAAP seniors' basketball champions. The score was 55-69 with 10 minutes remaining in the second half. It's anybody's game but the FEU hoopsters looked more inspired as the game went on. There was that encounter under the goal when Marte Saldana of FEU and Jaime Manansala of UE practically embraced each other trying to get ahead in reaching for the ball. Later, Ramon Cruz of UE intercepted Anthony Dasalla's pass to a teammate and he scored for two. Score: 61-76, with FEU still ahead. Then Rico Acuna unstoppable, did a running lay-up and UE scored 63. Until Valencia got a foul and made the couple of shots from the foul line. With 3 minutes remaining in the second half, Alex Tan of UE and Marte Saldana jumped for the ball and soon, American Michael Manyak upped UE's score to 76 with FEU still ahead by 10 points. With 1 minute forty seconds, Saldana was fouled by a UE player. He went to the top of the keyhole, made ready to shoot the bleachers from both sides practically erupted -- either for or against. Saldana split his charities. Again, Manyak did his thing and brought the score to 78 for UE. At this juncture, it was a frenetic, seemingly no-holds-barred game since clock was fast ticking and end was nearing. Full-court press were evident. Then Valencia of FEU, seemingly irritated by Cruz of UE was on the verge of throwing a punch when the referee spotted him and caught him in the act. With Valencia thrown out of the game, the Tamaraws lost someone vitally needed at the game's closing. With the score 78-87, and with only a minute left and 20 seconds, the contest took on additional fury. It was then the not-so-tall Danilo Manalastas was sent in by FEU and he was unstoppable. When the final score was chalked, 82-91, the sudden deafening eruption of jubilation from the crowd was a fitting climax to FEU's ending the two year reign of the Warriors and garnering the elusive title for the third time in the last five years.

Although the Ottoman Empire had agreed to give up vast territories, including what is now Syria and Iraq, the Allies further retained the power of controlling what was left of the Ottoman Empire, namely Turkey. On 22 February 1919, Kahramanmara≈ü was occupied by the British Army forces. However, the British side handed the city to the French Army on 29 October 1919. A part of the French troops consisted of French Foreign Legion, which was composed of local Armenians. On 31 October, a group of Armenian legion soldiers made a scene in front of a women's hamam, trying to tear the veil of a woman. Following the brawl between the legion soldiers and the Turks, several Turks and Armenians were killed. A milkman named S√ºt√ß√º ƒ∞mam is known as the first to fire. He is now considered as one of the symbols of Kahramanmara≈ü resistance. On 26 November, the French commander hauled down the Ottoman flag, which was still flying over the castle, and this event incited a civil resistance.

Schulz (born April 4, 1931) is an American businessman who was an Independent candidate for Governor of Arizona in the 1986 gubernatorial election, and was the Democratic nominee against Barry Goldwater in the 1980 U.S. Senate election. Early life, career and education Bill Schulz was born in Des Moines, Iowa on April 4, 1931 to Herman Schulz and Ellen Margaret Hazelrigg. He attended Greenwood Elementary School. Bill graduated from the Kentucky Military Institute in 1949, and the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1954. He served as a US Army officer in Germany from 1954 to 1957, reaching the rank of 2nd Lt. He resigned his commission to focus on a career in business, and attended Harvard University's business school, graduating in 1959. Following his graduation from Harvard Business School, Schulz founded his own business, known as Homesmith, which offered home repair services in the Palo Alto, California area. Schulz then founded W. R. Schulz and Associates, which owned and managed 88 garden apartment properties in the Phoenix metropolitan area. Schulz is credited with getting the Apartment Renter's Tax Relief Bill passed through the state legislature, which led to his involvement in politics. Bill is known for his humor and practicality when confronted with small business challenges, and his love of trees. He is the author of \\"Looking Back, With Some Forward Thoughts,\\" a no-holds family history up to 1990. Political career Schulz's first foray into seeking political office began with the 1978 gubernatorial election, where he ran as a Democratic candidate, challenging incumbent Governor Wesley Bolin. He announced his campaign after traveling around the state, and compiled the research into a \\"Goals for Arizona\\" campaign. Following the death of Bolin in March 1978, Schulz withdrew from the election and endorsed Bruce Babbitt, who ascended to the governorship. Babbitt was Attorney General of Arizona at the time of Bolin's death. Following his 1978 gubernatorial election withdrawal, Schulz announced his intention to run for the U.S. Senate in the 1980 election, and challenge incumbent U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater. His campaign slogan was \\"Energy for the Eighties,\\" and Schulz won the Democratic nomination, defeating two other candidates. In the general election, Schulz lost by a very narrow margin, with Goldwater receiving 49.5% to Schulz's 48.4%. He conceded rather than dispute the collection or provenance of the ballots. Schulz announced his intention in 1984 to run for the governorship once again in the 1986 election, but initially withdrew from the race in 1985 due to the health of his daughter. Schulz then decided to re-enter the race, but was required to do so as an Independent candidate, as he was not able to seek the Democratic nomination. In September 1986, Schulz collected enough signatures to be placed on the November ballot as an independent. During the election, Schulz was criticized for constantly changing his position on the issues. Despite Schulz leading in many polls leading up to the election, Republican nominee Evan Mecham was elected as Governor, due to the race being split into a three-way contest, and causing the Democratic nominee Carolyn Warner to lose by a narrow margin to Mecham. Mecham would be impeached from office only two years later, but the 1986 gubernatorial race ended Schulz's political career and he returned to the private sector.

It has a single tubular leaf and up to twenty pale green, tan and lilac-coloured flowers. It was first collected in the 1960s in a location known as the Hundred of Koppio on the Eyre Peninsula but was not described until 2008 from a new collection in 2004. Description Prasophyllum laxum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single loosely erect, tube-shaped leaf up to long and wide. The flowering stem emerges from the leaf above the ground. Between five and twenty strongly scented flowers are irregularly arranged along a drooping flowering stem up to long. The flowers are pale green on the inside, tan-coloured on the outside and as with others in the genus, are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The ovary is oval-shaped, erect, long and wide. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped to lance-shaped, long, about wide and points downwards. The lateral sepals are a similar size to the dorsal sepal, linear to lance-shaped and free from each other. The petals are linear in shape, about long, wide and pale green with white edges. The labellum is egg-shaped, very pale pink, long, about wide and curves gently upwards then the tip curves forwards. There is a green, channelled callus in the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs in late September and October but the flowers are short-lived. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum laxum was first formally described in 2008 by Robert John Bates and the description was published in Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens from a specimen collected near Wanilla. The specific epithet (laxum) is a Latin word meaning \\"loose\\" or \\"slack\\" referring to the loosely erect leaf and flowering stem. Distribution and habitat The lax leek orchid is only known from a single hill between Koppio and Wanilla on the Eyre Peninsula. It grows in sparse woodland. Conservation Prasophyllum laxum is listed as \\"Critically Endangered\\" under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act. The main threats to the population are habitat degradation by livestock and rabbits and from potential mining developments.

More broadly, it refers to the ability of privileged groups to keep an exclusive grip on the advantages of \\"social place,\\" including non-ecological amenities. It has been characterized as \\"the other side of the coin\\" from environmental racism. Like other forms of racial privilege, it does not depend on personal racism, but rather structural racism. The concept of environmental privilege first developed from the historical scholarship of Dorceta Taylor, who led the shift in scholarship on environmental racism away from consideration of environmental disadvantage in isolation, and toward a more holistic approach that accounted for the discriminatory effects of restrictive zoning. Environmental privilege is often used in critiques of \\"green gentrification\\", where environmental amenities such as urban agriculture cater largely to white or otherwise privileged urban groups. It has proven particularly illuminating in understanding the correlation between whiteness and participation in farmer's markets.

It is the fourteenth nature documentary to be released under the Disneynature label. The film was released theatrically on March 28, 2018 in France under the title Blue with actress C√©cile de France providing narration. It was originally scheduled to be released theatrically on April 20, 2018 in the United States under the title Dolphins with narration by Owen Wilson, but was confirmed to be taken off the theatrical calendar the week of release. It was then announced that the film would be released at the launch of Disney+, making it the first Disneynature film to be released exclusively on the streaming platform in the United States, with Natalie Portman narrating, but Disney+ launched without Dolphin Reef being available to watch. The film was finally released alongside Elephant as a Disney+ exclusive on April 3, 2020. Plot Echo is a young and playful bottlenose dolphin who isn't like the rest of his pod. He believes he's just not ready to grow up, but his mother, Kumu, tries teaching him to find his own food. Just as they depart for their coral reef home, Echo's favourite neighbour, Mr. Mantis, a peacock mantis shrimp, is being disrupted by other sea creatures of his pile of coral. One night while the rest of the pod is asleep, Echo is surprised to be greeted by a mothered humpback whale named Mo'orea, who has traveled miles to Echo's homes to find a male partner to help protect her newborn daughter, Fluke (who doesn't seem sure about Echo), Kumu soon calls out for her son, and bids farewell the two whales. Miles away, many humpback whales are about to set off to fight over Mo'orea and Fluke, but the largest one is more determined. Mr. Mantis meanwhile is having his own problems trying to get his coral together and trying to get his fellow gardeners to work, but to his surprise, a school of green humphead parrotfish come to the rescue to clean out the coral, while Mr. Mantis and his neighbours are confronted by a cuttlefish, who strikes a small crab trying to invade Mr. Mantis' home. Meanwhile, a pod of killer whales arrive on the island looking for prey, for Fluke's safety, Mo'orea makes contact with the male humpbacks, and they all set off for their rescue, just as the killer whales are about to charge for Fluke. The large male fends off the invaders, and wins over Mo'orea and Fluke's hearts. As night falls, Echo and his pod are confronted by another pod of rival dolphins, the home team and rivals fight each other, while Echo swims off and is lost, Kumu and the rest of the pod spend hours looking for him. Echo (who has become lost in the dark sea), meets a sea turtle, and the two escape up to the surface for air. Echo survives the night, and is reunited with Kumu. Kumu starts to teach her son how to hunt fish, she uses her tail to make a mud ring to block the fish, Echo successfully copies the same. and he and the rest of the pod enjoy their meal of fish. Back on Coral Reef, Mr. Mantis is confronted by the Cuttlefish. Before it can catch him with its mouth, Echo comes to the rescue. Echo has now learned the importance how to survive the ocean, thanks to his mother. Mo'orea and Fluke begin a new life with the large male, and Mr. Mantis continues to enjoy his pile of coral. Cast *Natalie Portman as the narrator Themes Through the antics of Echo, the movie asserts that children should listen to their parents. Producer Roy Conli said that \\"it was clear that the way that a mother and young dolphin react is that the mother is truly the supervisor and is responsible, post weaning, to bring a male or female young dolphin to maturity.\\" The film also promotes conservation of the reefs. Its \\"making-of\\" documentary, Diving with Dolphins, revealed that in the three years of production of the film, one-third of the reef used on location died. Despite this, Scholey said, \\"If the young people can fall in love with the ocean and its creatures, the oceans have a hope. That‚Äôs why I make these films. That‚Äôs the goal.‚Äù Development Owen Wilson was slated to be the original narrator, before the job went to Natalie Portman. Disneynature had invited her to a screening of one of their previous projects, back when Portman was living in Paris, and she brought her child along for the viewing. At the event, she expressed a desire to voice one of their documentaries in the future. In her 20s, she learned to scuba dive with dolphins (off the coast of Eilat, Israel, situated on the Red Sea) and was excited to join the cast. Keith Scholey is the director, who also directed Disneynature's Bears, and Roy Conli is its producer. Find a dolphin pod that would allow humans to film it required research. The featured pod is in the Red Sea. Production It took over three years to make the production. The filming was done in French Polynesia, Hawaii, and Florida by cinematographers Roger Horrocks, Paul Atkins, Didier Noirot (who previously worked on Jacques Cousteau's crew) and Jamie McPherson. Scientists on hand were Angela Zillener, Laura Engelby and Joe Mobley. The fact that dolphins are always in motion and can move very quickly presented a challenge during filming. Horrok said that while dolphins are the ‚Äúmost welcome‚Äù animals he's ever filmed, he conceded that ‚Äúfilming dolphins is the most physical because they‚Äôre constantly on the move.‚Äù Along that same vein, Conli said \\"that it‚Äôs really difficult to stay up with one dolphin. There was one Echo, who was the guiding force, and then I like to say that Echo had a lot of stunt doubles.\\" For fast moving scenes, shots were captured on a scooter fitted with a torpedo-like propeller. As it is impossible to follow a dolphin for an extended amount of time, cinematographers would film as long as they could, gathering thousands of hours of footage. They would also film elements from the dolphins' environment. The editing team (lead by Martin Elsbury) then pieced together a narrative that, according to Scholey, is \\"true to the life of a dolphin.\\" Photography not taken underwater was done by bot, from jet ski, or from helicopter. Portman recorded her narration in a studio in Los Angeles. The directors provided notes on the behavior happening on screen to inform her narration. Release The film was released in 2018 in France with the title Blue and with Cecile de France as its narrator. Original trailers for the American release (under its formal title Dolphins) indicated a release date of Earth Day 2018. Diving With Dolphins is a behind-the-scenes look at the making of Dolphin Reef. The documentary shares a director in Keith Scholey, but is narrated by Celine Cousteau, the granddaughter of oceanographer Jacques Cousteau. Reception Dolphin Reef received largely positive critical reviews. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes assigned the film a score of 100% based on 20 reviews, while Metacritic assigned it a 79 out of 100, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" Owen Gleiberman with Variety called the film \\"a puckish, bedazzling, and memorable entry in the Disney nature canon.\\" Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter commented on the film's \\"gorgeous cinematography and canny editing typical of Disney nature docs as well as Portman's soothingly lighthearted, bedtime story-style narration that turns serious at just the right times.\\" Steve Pond with TheWrap called it \\"the Goodfellas of nature docs,\\" saying \\"'Dolphin Reef' is a satisfying entry in the Disneynature slate, albeit one where the dolphins in the title are upstaged by some of their supporting cast, and the reef itself is even more spectacular than the creatures who get the most screen time.\\" In his review, Daniel Rutledge said the film was \\"the delightful, wondrous joy we need right now,\\" adding that \\"Natalie Portman is ideal as the voiceover star,\\" and \\"the photography is also consistently brilliant with the camera operators getting right up amongst the dolphins and whales and in amazingly tight on the little coral creatures.\\" Music Steven Price (of Gravity, Our Planet, and Suicide Squad) composed the film's original score. He said scoring the film was \\"fun\\" since the \\"flow of water is so musical\\" and Disneynature still \\"values tunes ... and emotional music.\\" He also noted that, historically, Disney has produced nature films as \\"family-based thing,\\" but that this story focused on being ecologically sound, about \\"the interconnection of everything,\\" and character driven. He says this approach led him to approach writing in a different way. Price led a 76-piece orchestra with a choir of 24 female voices at Abbey Road studio. He also employed the use of synthesizers to capture the \\"colors\\" of the underwater story. =Soundtrack= Disney made the soundtrack available for digital release on April 3, 2020.

The magazine was therefore transformed from the official magazine of NAPF into a general magazine of political education, and in September of the following year the Senki Company became fully independent of NAPF. In November 1931, NAPF was liquidated in the creation of the (Federacio de Proletaj Kultur Organizoj Japanaj, abbreviated KOPF, „Ç≥„ÉÉ„Éó).

The Sanctuary of the Virgin of Taburnus (Italian: Santuario della Madonna del Taburno), also known as Sanctuary of Saint Mary of Mount Taburno (Italian: Santuario di Santa Maria a Monte Taburno), is a religious structure built at the end of the 15th century at the foot of Mount Taburno. It is located in the comune of Bucciano, in the province of Benevento of Southern Italy. For more than two hundred years it was used by Dominican friars. Location The sanctuary is located in the territory of Bucciano, at an elevation of 544 metres above sea level, on the southern foothills of the Taburno Camposauro massif. Its position overlooks most of the Valle Caudina, and the structures composing it are surrounded by thick vegetation. Trails leading to three caves decorated with rock paintings start from the sanctuary. History The cave with the remains of a painting of the Virgin Mary. According to popular tradition, in 1401 a deaf-mute girl named Agnese, from the nearby town of Moiano, was herding sheep when a statue of the Virgin Mary located in a cave called her, asking to be moved to a better, nearby place. The Virgin Mary also returned hearing and speech to the girl. The news spread rapidly in the area, and Carlo Carafa, count of Airola, had a chapel built in the vicinity of the cave. The apparition of an effigy of the Virgin Mary was a common reason for the foundation of sanctuaries at the time. The cloister In 1494 a convent was built by the grandchild of Carlo Carafa, at the time count of Airola and bearing the same name, both out of devotion, and because of the growing fame of the place, to ingratiate the devoted populace.p. 23 The sanctuary was given to the Dominican friars in 1498. The prior of the convent acted as priest for the population leaving near the Fizzo source of Bucciano, and since 1571 the monks held the Corpus Domini procession by themselves. From 1669 to 1672 Vincenzo Maria Orsini, who later became Pope Benedict XIII lived in the convent.p. 26 The sanctuary became one of the most important religious centres in Campania. In 1743 the monks decided to leave the monastery and move to a new one built near Airola, and the decision was approved in 1753 by Brancone, State Secretary of the Kingdom of Naples. The people of Moiano and Bucciano protested to Charles III of Spain and later, in 1779, to Ferdinand IV, arguing that the state of neglect claimed by the Dominicans was a mere need of maintenance, and that architectural elements had been taken from the sanctuary and used in the newly built convent. Ferdinand IV ordered the monks to celebrate mass daily at their own expense, but this did not stop the progressive decline of the structure.p.32 =Restoration efforts= The church before restoration. The bell-tower is still on four levels. In 1890 the priest of a Bucciano parish and the mayor of the town began promoting efforts to restore the sanctuary. Camillo Siciliano di Rende, archbishop of Benevento at the time, made the first solemn pilgrimage in 1891.p. 52 The following year structural reinforcement works were conducted, and further restorations occurred in 1925, with financial aid by Bucciano people who had emigrated to the United States.p.37 The sanctuary was damaged by the 1930 Irpinia earthquake, being again restored thanks to donations by migrants of the area, and by the 1980 Irpinia earthquake. After the latter, a new period of neglect started.p.39 The bishop of the Diocese of Cerreto Sannita-Telese-Sant‚ÄôAgata de‚Äô Goti appointed in 1998, Michele de Rosa, pushed for a collaboration of his diocese, the parish and the comune of Bucciano for the recovery of the sanctuary. Along with the province of Benevento administration, the three parties restored several parts of the sanctuary at the beginning of the 2000s. The current church was inaugurated in November 2007.p. 42 Architecture The inside of the church In the anterior part of the structure there is a portico with three round arches, preceded by a wide limestone stairway. The bell tower once had four floors, but the last floor was demolished during restoration works. Near the buildings composing the sanctuary is the cave where the statue of the Virgin Mary was found.p. 61p. 35 A cell door with a lunette depicting a Saint The church has a rectangular nave, whose length is double its width. The ceiling has two gothic-style rib vaults, held by two pillars. The baked clay floor is the only remaining part of the original church, and is composed of octagonal paving stones of different colours. In the church there were five altars, but only the main one remains, having been restored according to records describing the original layout.pp. 32-35p. 62 The appearance of the cloister, located in the middle of the complex, has changed after restoration works. It used to be on two levels, but one has been closed and an oculus gives light to the lower floor. A wing of the cloister is now integral part of the convent, which is on two levels and is L-shaped. On its upper floor are the cells of the monks, upon whose doors are lunettes depicting different Dominican saints. The lower floor included the kitchen, the refectory and the water cisterns.pp. 32-35p. 63 Devotion The sanctuary is the main tourism draw of Bucciano, attracting Marian devotees from the surroundings. The main pilgrimage to the sanctuary is held on Divine Mercy Sunday. Due to the popularity of the sanctuary Pope Sixtus V allowed women to enter the sanctuary four times a year. To the sanctuary, and to the Virgin Mary effigies it holds, several prodigies are attributed. A group of deaf people from the region visits the sanctuary annually.

Ryan has organized \\"Jane's Walk\\" events in Plateau-Mont-Royal, inspired by the legacy of Jane Jacobs. In 2014, he was quoted as saying, \\"The idea [behind the walks] is to allow people to discover their neighbourhoods in a sort of alternative manner. People often like to walk through their neighbourhoods to perhaps discover a new area or a new shopping district. Jane's Walks brings us to another philosophy, which is what are the urban development challenges in our district? What changes came about because of citizen involvement?

He was a teacher, miner and journalist. Mofutsanyana became an active member of the Communist Party of South Africa and the African National Congress. He studied in the Lenin School in Moscow in the 1930s where he strengthened his political knowledge. A district municipality in the eastern Free State of South Africa is named in his honour. Early life Thabo Edwin Mofutsanyana was born in 1899 at Witsieshoek/Phuthaditjhaba in the eastern Free State. He completed his primary schooling in Phuthaditjhaba. At the time, schools only went up to Grade six when learners reached around the age of twelve or thirteen. Mofutsanyana's first job was in a factory Mofutsanyana's father was a sharecropper. During the South African War, he was arrested by the British as they believed that he was involved on the side of the Boers. he was sent to a prison camp in Pietermaritzburg and later to a prison on St Helena Island ‚Äì off the west coast of Africa. He was kept there until the end of the war in 1902. At the age of 17, Mofutsanyana went to find employment in Johannesburg in order to pay for his education. His first job was as a guard in a factory that made gold bars. His employer, Mr Bush, befriended him and took Mofutsanyana with him when he moved to Cape Town. The stay, however, was short-lived as Bush committed suicide. Political career Mofutsanyana joined the South African Native National Congress in 1921 and subsequently left his job as a miner to take up full-time employment at the organisation. Mofutsanyana had been motivated to join the SANNC after an incident involving his friend, Jacob Majoro. Majoro and two other men tried to board a train soon after it took off but accidentally pulled the conductor from the carriage in their attempt to board. Majoro was charged for this incident and Mofutsanyana was angered as it appeared to be a racially charged punishment. Mofutsanyana joined the Communist Party of South Africa (CPSA) in 1929 after listening to a speech by Jimmy Shields (journalist) who was a young communist from Scotland. Shields had called for the working class, particularly Black South Africans, to fight for their rights to rule. Shortly thereafter, on the 16th of December 1929, Mofutsanyana organised a protest march in Potchefstroom against the pass laws. The protest was invaded by white protesters who threatened Mofutsanyana at gun point. Mofutsanyana later attended at a night school run by the CPSA. In one of his speeches there, Mofutsanyana was quoted as saying ‚Äò‚Äô‚ÄôTo fight your enemy, you must know his language‚Äô. In 1932, the CPSA held a meeting in Martindale in Johannesburg where Mofutsanyana addressed workers. He told them that they should refuse to pay taxes if their employers refused to provide food, clothing and clean water. Mofutsanyana had become the secretary-general of the African Federation of Trade Unions (AFTU) which was uniting various unions at the time and encouraged workers to form a special group and join the AFTU. A week later, Mofutsanyana led a march of unemployed workers to the Johannesburg offices of George Ballended, who was in charge of the Township (South Africa) where Black people were housed, to demand better living conditions. Marriage Mofutsanyana married Josie Palmer in 1930 who also worked for the CPSA. They lived in relative poverty in a room in the backyard of Palmer's grandmother's house. Palmer earned extra money by doing laundry for White families. In 1954, she helped found the Federation of South African Women (FEDSAW) together with Lillian Ngoyi, Helen Joseph, Rahima Moosa and many others. Mofutsanyana in Moscow In the 1930s, Black South Africans were flown to Moscow for a period of two years to learn about communism and ways to fight capitalism. The first three leaders were Mofutsanyana, Albert Nzula and Gana Makabeni. Mofutsanyana left South Africa midway through 1932 over the Mozambican border. He spent a few weeks in the part of Louren√ßo Marques, now known as Maputo. He then boarded a ship to Italy where he was almost discovered by a British Consul who had been alerted by the South African government to a Black communist on board. He managed to talk his way out of the altercation as the officials had no proof that he was the Black man they were looking for. In 1933, Mofutsanyana enrolled at the International Lenin School and was placed in the Negro section together with other Black students from other countries. Their studies covered the skills to organise a trade union, military science and communism. He returned to South Africa in 1934 after completing his studies. Back in South Africa In December 1935, Mofutsanyana attended the All African Convention (an organised body that intended to promote African rights through boycotts) where he was elected to its executive. In 1937, Mofutsanyana joined J. B. Marks and others in an attempt to revive the African National Congress. Under Alfred Bitini Xuma, Mofutsanyana served on the ANC National Executive Committee as an advisor on labour related matters. In 1937, 1942 and 1948, Mofutsanyana ran as a communist candidate for election to the Natives Representative Council but never won an election. In 1943, Mofutsanyana and Radebe organised a conference at which the African Mineworkers Union (AMWU) was formed with J. B. Marks becoming its first president. The organisation was founded due to difficulties experienced by Black workers who had hitherto been working with White unions. These Black leaders wanted to form their own organisation run by Blacks. When the CPSA was banned in 1950, Mofutsanyana had been serving on its executive committee and was also on the forefront when the South African Communist Party was established. Exile In 1959, Mofutsanyana decided to escape persecution from South African government and take refuge in Lesotho. He earned an income by typing up letters from Lesotho miners who were looking for work in South Africa. He remained in exile for 30 years. Death Mofutsanyana died in his home town of Phuthaditjhaba in 1995. He was able to vote for the new democratic South Africa in April 1994. Govan Mbeki declared that he named his son Thabo Mbeki after Mofutsanyana as they were very close friends. Thabo Mofutsanyana District Municipality is named in his honour.

It is a Grade II listed building. Early History Historically belonging to the Parish of Whitchurch, Tongwynlais had no Anglican church of its own until 1850. Although the Ainon Baptist Church had existed since 1828, Anglican residents of the village were still obliged to travel nearly 2.5 miles to St Mary's Church in Whitchurch. In 1850, Henry Lewis, the squire of Greenmeadow, had his coach- house converted into a church and school, obviating the journey to Whitchurch for the first time. In 1875, he donated a site for a new purpose-built church, together with ¬£100 towards the new building. Contributions were also received from the Llandaff Church Extension Society and the Melingriffith Tin Plate Works, and the church's founding stone was laid in 1875 with John Prichard engaged as architect. The church, constructed in red and grey sandstone, was opened in February 1877, and would function as a chapel of ease to St Mary's Church, Whitchurch for the next 44 years. Its rood screen was donated by Herbert Cory in thanksgiving for the safe return of the villagers who fought in the First World War Independent Parish After the formation of the Church in Wales in 1920, changes were carried out to the parish structures in the area. In 1921, St Michael's was partitioned from the Parish of Whitchurch, and was placed in a new Parish of Tongwynlais. The new parish was initially in the Deanery of Caerphilly, but has since been transferred to the Deanery of Llandaff. St Michael's saw its graveyard reduced in width in 1950 owing to a road-widening scheme. In 1954, St Michael's was joined in its parish by St James' Church in Taff's Well and St Mary's Church in Nantgarw, which had both been separated from the Parish of Eglwysilan, though St Mary's in Nantgarw closed in 1983. St Michael's gained listed status in 1977. St Michael's current priest-in-charge is Revd. Zoe King, who took over from Anthony Russell in 2015. St Mary & St James, Taff's Well St Mary & St James The church of St Mary and St James in Taff's Well remains St Michael's sister church. Originally dedicated solely to St James, it was built on Church Street in and has a war memorial commemorating local people lost during the two world wars and the Troubles in Northern Ireland. After St Mary's in Nantgarw closed, St James' amended its name to St Mary and St James in commemoration.

The massacre was committed by Spanish soldiers under the command of Fadrique √Ålvarez de Toledo against the townspeople of Naarden as part of a punitive expedition against Dutch rebels later known as the Spanish Fury. The destruction of the city galvanized the Dutch rebels, leading them to continue the Dutch War of Independence against Spain.  History  = Background = During the Eighty Years' War, William the Silent of the provisional United Provinces led a revolt against the rule of King Phillip II of Spain. After years of Spanish military successes in the Southern Netherlands and Flanders, the revolt experienced a resurgence in 1572 when the Spanish were driven out of Brielle by the Dutch rebels. The capture of Brielle resulted in seven predominantly Protestant Dutch states renewing their support for the rebellion against Spain. In response, Phillip II ordered Fernando √Ålvarez de Toledo, the Spanish governor of the Netherlands, to suppress the revived Dutch revolt and restore Spanish authority to the Netherlands. √Ålvarez de Toledo planned to re- establish Spanish rule in the Netherlands by capturing revolting cities and by driving out militant protestants, whom had been one of the causes of original revolt. To this end, de Toledo organized a punitive expedition of Spanish soldiers and mercenaries. These soldiers were poorly paid, and it is often cited that de Toledo either expected to pay his army through the looting of towns, or actively encouraged looting for the sake of demoralizing the Dutch populace. In the fall of 1572, the elder de Toledo ordered his son Fadrique √Ålvarez de Toledo to capture and make an example of a number of Dutch towns, a campaign which would later be known as the Spanish Fury. On 2 October the Spanish army sacked Mechelen, where soldiers looted the city for three days and killed several hundred townspeople. Mothers and daughters were raped in front of family members and men were tortured and murdered. de Toledo reported to Madrid that \\"no nail was left in the wall\\" in Mechelen. The town of Zutphen was attacked soon after, and suffered a similar fate on 14 November. = Massacre of Naarden = News arrived in Naarden of the fall of Mechelen and Zutphen. The city was unprepared for an assault, and so a delegation of the city's residents began negotiations with the Spanish. It was agreed with Juli√°n Romero that Naarden would open its gates to a small garrison force, surrender supplies to the Spanish, and that every citizen of the city would swear a new oath to the King of Spain. Instead, the Spanish army arrived in its entirety and entered the city on 22 November, taking up positions in the town square. The people of Naarden were forcefully assembled, then led into the town's church and guildhall. The Spanish army then set fire to the buildings and began to sack the town. Several hundred townspeople burned to death, while hundreds more were killed in the square or in their homes. Around 60 of Naarden's 3000 inhabitants survived the massacre, with de Toledo stating in a report to King Phillip that \\"Not a man borne escaped\\" Naarden. Several days later, the Spanish army conscripted peasants from nearby Gooiland to demolish the remaining buildings in the ruined town. = Aftermath = Word spread of Naarden's sacking, often by way of the Spanish army itself. Contrary to the intent of the Spanish campaign, the destruction of Naarden became a rallying symbol for the Dutch rebels.

It was built by Mehram Khan, a eunuch and keeper of Jahangir's harem. Etymology The name can be translated as \\"Inn of Mehram\\". The term Mahram itself means unmarriageable kin with whom marriage or sexual intercourse would be considered haram (illegal in Islam) or people from whom purdah is not obligatory or legal escorts of a woman during journey longer than a day and night (24 hours).5538: Who are the mahrams in front of whom a woman can uncover? Islam Question and Answer General Supervisor: Shaykh Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid Published Date: 1999-11-24 Accessed date: 19 February 2017 In this context Mehram meant the eunuch named \\"Mehram Khan\\", a close escort and confidant who can freely talk and meet with women in king's harem. History According to the convener of INTACH Delhi, Swapna Liddle, the Mehram Ki Serai caravanserai for the comfort of travelers and eponymous Mehram Bazaar were built by a eunuch, Mehram Khan, who was an incharge of mughal harem during the reign of Jahangir.Francis Gladwin, 1788, \\"The History of Hindostan, during the reigns of Jeh√°ngir, Sh√°hjeh√°n, and Aurungzebe.\\". It was built at a distance of 7 kos (22.4 km) from the mughal city. Mehram nagar village, that later came up near it, has a double-storey pointed-arch vaulted gateway with large wooden door. In 1622 CE Shah Jahan (known as prince Khurram at that time) raised an army with the support of Mahabat Khan and marched against his own father emperor Jahangir and mother Nur Jahan. Mehram Khan, Fidai Khan, Motamid Khan (official court chronicler)Qazwini. fol. 233a translated by Begley and Desai (1984), page 14.* , page 18. and Kheleel Beg, were apprehended based on the evidence of Mirza Rustam and one more witness, after being accused of holding a secret correspondence with rebellious Shah Jehan. Those two witnesses were executed by Fidai Khan, and Mehram Khan was absolve of any wrongdoing by Fidai Khan. Later in 1639 CE, Mehram Khan built the serai and bazaar, both named after himself.  Architecture  The caravanserai, with chhatris above and octagonal vaulted cambers below on four corners, is built of rubble masonry and mughal lakhori bricks. The complex also has a baradari (open doors pavilion with 12 doors, 3 in each direction), 2 wells, an enclosure wall with 3 gateways, garden in the enclosure and a water channel coursing through the middle of the enclosure. Conservation By 2016, the dilapidated monument had been severely vandalised, two out of original four chattris and only one out of 3 original gates of enclosure survived, enclosure wall was broken at several places, both the wells had dried up, water channels was mostly buried under rubble, garden was overgrown with shrubs. In 2016 Government of Delhi's Department of Archaeology in collaboration with INTACH commenced the conservation, one of the 2 missing gateway was rebuilt, both wells and parts of the water channel were restored. With 40% work completed, it came to a halt in May 2017 after Defence Ministry stopped the work as no permission was taken from the Defence Ministry for conserving the monument standing on the land owned by Defence Ministry. Subsequently, efforts were being made by the Delhi state archeology department and local MLA to obtain the permission from Defence Ministry to complete the remaining work of this still dilapidated and abandoned monument.

The 7th battery was initially assembled under the Kuperjanov Infantry Battalion and then properly formed under the 2nd Artillery Regiment. The battery was also known as the \\"partisan battery\\" because of its roots in the Kuperjanov Battalion. On April 26, the headquarters moved to V√µru.

On August 31, while inspecting the units of the 2nd Artillery Regiment, he led a successful defence in Pechorsky district against Red Army units, which had managed to break through the lines of the 7th regiment. The attack was held back purely by artillery fire. In September, the batteries were formed into two artillery groups. On October 15, 1919, Podpolkovnik (Lt.Colonel) Georg Feofanov became the commander of the unit.

His father was a building contractor. He went to Lick-Wilmerding High School, San Francisco where he developed an early interests in marine engineering, studying the armaments and the outfittings of all the capital ships in the world. He liked to take long walks around the nearby Hunter's Point. Although he started studying engineering at the University of California in 1909, he developed an interest in physics, but decided to major in philosophy. After graduating at the head of his class in 1913, he received a scholarship to Harvard from the San Francisco Harvard Club. He gained his Ph.D. in philosophy in 1916. Here he studied with Bertrand Russell and Josiah Royce, being influenced by their ideas on scientific methodology. He rejected Royce's idealism and developed his interest in physics, particularly with fundamental physical theory e.g. J.J. Thomson's Corpuscular Theory of Matter, and the philosophical approach found in Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. Peirce's Lost Reports\\" Whilst at Harvard Lenzen was responsible for taking Charles Peirce's papers from Arisbe to Harvard. His familiarity with the papers gave rise to his suspicion that there were still in existence Peirce's gravity reports. From 1859 until the last day of 1891, Peirce had been employed by the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, in various geodetic investigations. These included making precise measurements of the intensity of the gravitational field at different locations. Peirce used swinging pendulums often of his own design. This practical involvement in physics played a major role in his Peirce's rejection scientific determinism. Lenzen's investigations led to the location of these report by Coast Survey archivist, Albert Whimpey in 1968. When Lenzen studied the papers he found that Peirce had first presented an overview of his methodology before presenting the data. Although this became common practice in the twentieth century this was not well received at the time. Simon Newcomb was particularly dismissive. Peirce refused to rewrite the reports. Thomas Corwin Mendenhall refused to publish them and engineered Peirce's sacking. Nevertheless, the data was used with inadequate attributation to Peirce. When looking Peirce's results nearly a hundred years later Lenzen found their accuracy comparable to contemporary computer results for the data.

Biography =Birth and parents= Garcia de S√° was born in a noble family in Porto, Portugal, around 1486. His father was Jo√£o Rodrigues de S√°, senhor (lord) of Sever, who was a chamberlain-in-chief and fidalgo of the Board of Dom Afonso V. His mother was Dona Joana de Albuquerque.Translated from the article \\"Garcia de S√°\\" of Portuguese Wikipedia.

His father was third time married Joana de Albuquerque with actual confirmation on 21 June 1484 and received her dowry the landlords of Gondomar and Aguiar de Sousa. =Career in Portuguese India= Dom Garcia de S√° first appeared in India in 1518 together with the new Governor of Portuguese India Diogo Lopes de Sequeira. In 1519-1521, he first time took the post of governor and captain- major of Malacca.Information from the articles \\"Portuguese Malacca\\" of English Wikipedia. On 28 of June 1522 he second time took the post of governor and captain-major of Malacca. In 1527 he commanded an armada which run to S. Miguel Islands. Bassein (c. 1539), drawn by Nuno da Cunha, Governor of Portuguese India (1528-38). Garcia de S√° made a great contribution to the restoration of the Fort of Diu after the siege of Diu by forces of the Ottoman Empire in 1538. One of the bastions of the Fort of Diu was even named in his honor, Bastion Garcia de S√°. Garsia de S√° was also a captain of Bassein as mentioned after the Portuguese Malacca. =Illegal coinage= The church of Our Lady of the Rosary is the oldest church in Goa. Garcia de S√° became famous when he was the captain of the Bassein and ordered to mint a certain amount of copper coins to facilitate local trade. The colony lacked any Portuguese money including local coins minted in Goa. And Garcia de S√° resolved to make such a desperate step, and almost paid with his career for it. Foes immediately denounced to the king Jo√£o III (1502-1557, king from 1521 to 1557) regarding such a blatant violation of the Royal prerogatives as coinage, and order was sent to Portuguese India to arrest the captain Garcia de S√°, and regarding the confiscation of all his property. The former captain of Bassein had to be deported immediately to Lisbon. However, quite high-rank defenders in Portugal and in Portuguese India took part to protect Garcia de S√°: the order on seizure of Garcia de S√° property was ignored in Portuguese India, and Garcia was able to justify himself in front of the king in Portugal. As result, he had return to Portuguese India as an honest man. church of Our Lady of the Rosary, with the following inscription: \\"Here lies Catherine, the wife of Garcia de S√° which asks for whom it read that ask mercy to God for her soul.\\" =Church and marriage= Garcia de S√° had married a local woman Catarina Pires, \\"the flower of Miragaia\\", portrayed by Camilo Castelo Branco. They had two daughters. His wife died in Goa in November 1546, and buried in a rich tomb, of white marble, in the wall of the chancel of the Church of Our Lady of the Rosary, in Goa. The following inscription is over her tomb: \\"Here lies Catarina, the wife of Garcia de S√° which asks for whom it read that ask mercy to God for her soul.\\" Ottoman fleet in the Indian Ocean in the 16th century =The threat of the Ottoman Empire= Reliable information from Portugal to Portuguese India and back has not received any more when the Portuguese lost their positions in Aden in 1548 due to the Ottoman Empire forces captured Aden in February 1548. =Governor of Portuguese India= After the death of the Viceroy of Portuguese India Jo√£o de Castro in Goa on 6 of June 1548, Garcia de S√° became the new Governor of Portuguese India in accordance with the administrative paperwork that was sent with the last ship from Portugal. He was largely supportive of many of the recommendations that were given to him at every opportunity, the previous ruler of Portuguese India Jo√£o de Castro. So, Garcia de S√° was appointed as governor of Portuguese India in June, 1548. Garcia de S√° did not embark on military adventures due to his advanced age, but he achieved significant successes through peaceful negotiations. The ruler of Bijapur Ibrahim Adil Shah I made peace with the Portuguese at the end of August 1548, he recognized all the commercial privileges and rights of the Portuguese to the districts of Bardez and Salcete, and Adil Shah freed also the Portuguese ambassador. On the contrary, the Portuguese pledged to inform Ibrahim Adil Shah I if Mir Ali left the territory of Goa. In January 1549, Garcia de S√° concluded a peace treaty with Gujarat. This treaty was an exact copy of the previous treaty, but now the Portuguese pledged not to demolish the wall which separated their possessions in Diu from the rest of the city. Union with the Raja of Tanur, who from time to time rebelled against Samorin, was less successful. Raja of Tanur wanted to enlist the support of the Portuguese in the war against the Samorin and even arrived in Goa in 1548 to be baptized. He also promised that all his subjects would convert to Christianity, but all this turned out to be just camouflage. But when Samorin began to collect an army for another war with the Portuguese in 1549, the Raja of Tanur provided all his troops at his disposal. Garcia de S√° continued his financial policy when he became governor of Portuguese India. The local mint in Goa minted only copper and silver coins under a royal license. However, Don Garcia decided to improve a little the financial atmosphere in the Portuguese colonies and began the first gold European coins chasing in Portuguese India. =Death and afterword= Garcia de S√° died in Goa on June 13, 1549. After his death, the colony council offered Jorge Cabral the post of governor of Portuguese India, since his name was on the list of applicants for this position in an emergency situation. It is obvious that Don Garcia initiative to mint the gold coins in Goa would have found his detractors, but Garcia de S√° premature death in 1549 stopped all such coin's initiatives and denunciations. Several letters and orders has remained from Garcia de S√°, as governor and captain-general of Portuguese India, including the letters to the King and Secretary of State Pedro de Alc√°√ßova Carneiro. =Descendants= Dom Garcia de S√° was married to a woman Catherine Pires, \\"the flower of Miragaia\\". They had two daughters, Dona Joana de Albuquerque and Dona Leonor de S√°. But Garcia de S√° managed to marry them successfully only during his governorship. Both daughters married the same day, at the S√© de Goa: * Dona Joana married Dom Ant√≥nio de Noronha (1517-1550), chief captain of the naval fleet of Portuguese India, son of the Viceroy Dom Garcia de Noronha. They had generation. * Dona Leonor (Leonora) married Manuel de Sousa de Sep√∫lveda, one of the heroes of the defense of Diu, with an extinct generation. Lu√≠s de Cam√µes chanted her in his poems. Garc√≠a de S√° was lord of the Quinta da Quint√£ in Sardoura (Castelo de Paiva), term of the monastery of Vila Boa do Bispo, and it was given to his daughter Dona Leonor (Leonora) in dowry as per proxy made in Portuguese India to Diogo Brand√£o Sanches on October 24 of 1549, registered in the term in 1552. Since Dona Leonor did not have a generation, she Had to remain it for her only sister Donna Joana de Albuquerque. His daughter Dona Lianora de S√° entered even the legendary history of Portugal due to she was married Dom Manuel de Sousa de Sep√∫lveda, one of the heroes of the defense of Diu and both, she and her husband, died during a shipwreck at the southern coasts of Africa in 1552.

It is a parasite of fish. In the cnidarian Hydrichthys sarcotretis, parasitism is taken a stage further when the hydrozoan attaches itself to the C. medusaeus. This is itself an ectoparasite of the Northern lampfish (Stenobrachius leucopsarus) in the family Myctophidae. The copepod attaches itself to the bulbus arteriosus of the fish. Such a parasitic chain is known as hyperparasitism. C. medusaeus requires two hosts for proper development. It will go through five successive postembryonic stages, then only the postmated females will go into the pericardial cavity of a lanternfish. The actions of the copepod castrate its fish host. Both male and female fish do not reproduce and seem to grow faster when attacked by the copepod and it seems to have a negligible energy demand from them. The hydrozoan parasite castrates the copepod, a process called hypercastration.

It is an erect shrub with its branches and leaves densely covered with woolly hairs. The leaves are often oblong but very variable in shape and the flowers are pinkish-white with pink spots inside and are surrounded by yellow woolly sepals. Description Quoya verbascina is an erect shrub with its main stem and branches densely covered with woolly, branched, dark brownish-red or pale brownish-yellow hairs, often appearing yellowish in the upper parts of the plant. The leaves are often elliptic to oblong in shape but otherwise very variable. They are mostly long, wide, thick, soft and densely covered with woolly hairs. The flowers are arranged in the upper leaf axils, usually in a groups of between five and nine flowers, each on a woolly pedicel mostly long. There are bracts and smaller bracteoles which are woolly on the outside, at the base of the flowers. The five yellow sepals are long and joined at the base to form a tube long, with thin, lance-shaped lobes on the end. The sepal tube is densely covered with woolly hairs on the outside and more or less glabrous on the inside. The petals are pinkish-white with pink spots inside the petal tube. The five petals are long, forming a tube long with a wide opening and five lobes. The two upper lobes are short and oblong, the two lower outer lobes are small and triangular and the middle lobe is more than twice as large as the other four. The outside of the petal tube is covered with short, soft hairs and is glabrous inside apart from a ring of hairs around the ovary. The four stamens are about as long as the petal tube, the upper pair much shorter than the lower pair. Flowering occurs mainly from July to December and is followed by fruit which is a curved oval shape, long, covered with soft hairs and has the sepals attached. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1859 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Chloanthes verbascina. The description was published in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae from a specimen collected by Augustus Oldfield near the Murchison River. In 1870, George Bentham changed the name to Pityrodia verbascina but in 2011, Barry Conn and Murray Henwood changed it to Quoya verbascina and published the change in Australian Systematic Botany. The specific epithet (verbascina) is derived from the Latin name for the plant commonly known as \\"mullein\\". Distribution and habitat Golden bush mostly grows in shrubland or in kwongan, often on road verges. It is mostly found between Carnarvon and Moora in the Avon Wheatbelt, Carnarvon, Geraldton Sandplains, Murchison, Swan Coastal Plain and Yagoo biogeographic regions. Conservation Quoya verbascina is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

These bacteria have shown antibiotic resistance (or antimicrobial resistance).  Enzyme NDM-1 (New Delhi Metallo- beta-lactamase-1)  NDM-1 is an enzyme that makes bacteria resistant to a broad range of beta-lactam antibiotics. NDM-1 (New Delhi Metallo-beta- lactamase-1) originated in India. In Indian hospitals hospital-acquired infections are common and with the new super-bugs on rise in India, this can make them dangerous. Mapping of sewage and water supply samples that were NDM-1-positive indicates widespread infection in New Delhi already back in 2011. NDM-1 was first detected in a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate from a Swedish patient of Indian origin in 2008. It was later detected in bacteria in India, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and Japan.  Gram positive  =Clostridium difficile= Clostridium difficile is a nosocomial pathogen that causes diarrheal disease worldwide. Diarrhea caused by C. difficile can be life-threatening. Infections are most frequent in people who have had recent medical and/or antibiotic treatment. C. difficile infections commonly occur during hospitalization. According to a 2015 CDC report, C. difficile caused almost 500,000 infections in the United States over a year period. Associated with these infections were an estimated 15,000 deaths. The CDC estimates that C. difficile infection costs could amount to $3.8 billion over a 5-year span. C. difficile colitis is most strongly associated with fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and clindamycin. Some research suggests the overuse of antibiotics in the raising of livestock is contributing to outbreaks of bacterial infections such as C. difficile.[16] Antibiotics, especially those with a broad activity spectrum (such as clindamycin) disrupt normal intestinal flora. This can lead to an overgrowth of C. difficile, which flourishes under these conditions. Pseudomembranous colitis can follow, creating generalized inflammation of the colon and the development of \\"pseudomembrane\\", a viscous collection of inflammatory cells, fibrin, and necrotic cells.[4] Clindamycin-resistant C. difficile was reported as the causative agent of large outbreaks of diarrheal disease in hospitals in New York, Arizona, Florida and Massachusetts between 1989 and 1992. Geographically dispersed outbreaks of C. difficile strains resistant to fluoroquinolone antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, were also reported in North America in 2005. = Enterococcus = Multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium are associated with nosocomial infections. These strains include: penicillin- resistant Enterococcus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, and linezolid- resistant Enterococcus. =Mycobacterium tuberculosis= Tuberculosis (TB) resistant to antibiotics is called MDR TB (multidrug-resistant TB). Globally, MDR TB causes 150,000 deaths annually. The rise of the HIV/AIDS epidemic has contributed to this. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an obligate pathogen that has evolved to ensure its persistence in human populations. This is evident in the fact that Mycobacterium tuberculosis must cause a pulmonary disease in order to be successfully transmitted from one person to another. Tuberculosis better known as TB has one of the highest mortality rates among pathogens in the world. Mortality rates have not seen a significant decrease due to its growing resistance to certain antibiotics. Although there is years worth of research and many work hours that have been devoted to the creation of a vaccine, one still does not exist. TB has a very high level of virulence which is mainly due in part to the fact it is extremely transmissible. TB was considered one of the most prevalent diseases, and did not have a cure until the discovery of streptomycin by Selman Waksman in 1943. However, the bacteria soon developed resistance. Since then, drugs such as isoniazid and rifampin have been used. M. tuberculosis develops resistance to drugs by spontaneous mutations in its genomes. These types of mutations can lead to genotype and phenotype changes that can contribute to reproductive success therefore they can be passed on and evolve into resistant bacteria. Resistance to one drug is common, and this is why treatment is usually done with more than one drug. Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR TB) is TB that is also resistant to the second line of drugs. Resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to isoniazid, rifampin, and other common treatments has become an increasingly relevant clinical challenge. Evidence is lacking for whether these bacteria have plasmids. M. tuberculosis lack the opportunity to interact with other bacteria in order to share plasmids. =Mycoplasma genitalium= Mycoplasma genitalium is a small pathogenic bacterium that lives on the ciliated epithelial cells of the urinary and genital tracts in humans. It is still controversial whether or not this bacterium is to be recognized as a sexually transmitted pathogen. Infection with Mycoplasma genitalium sometimes produces clinical symptoms, or a combination of symptoms, but sometimes can be asymptomatic. It causes inflammation in the urethra (urethritis) both in men and women, which is associated with mucopurulent discharge in the urinary tract, and burning while urinating. Treatment of Mycoplasma genitalium infections is becoming increasingly difficult due to rapidly developing multi-drug resistance, and diagnosis and treatment is further hampered by the fact that M. genitalium infections are not routinely detected. Azithromycin is the most common first- line treatment, but the commonly-used 1 gram single-dose azithromycin treatment can lead to the bacteria commonly developing resistance to azithromycin. An alternative five-day treatment with azithromycin showed no development of antimicrobial resistance. Efficacy of azithromycin against M. genitalium has decreased substantially, which is thought to occur through SNPs in the 23S rRNA gene. The same SNPs are thought to be responsible for resistance against josamycin which is prescribed in some countries. Moxifloxacin can be used as a second-line treatment in case azithromycin is not able to eradicate the infection. However, resistance against moxifloxacin has been observed since 2007, thought to be due to parC SNPs. Tetracyclines, including doxycycline, have a low clinical eradication rate for M. genitalium infections. A few cases have been described where doxycycline, azithromycin and moxifloxacin had all failed, but pristinamycin was still able to eradicate the infection. =Staphylococcus aureus= Staphylococcus aureus is one of the major resistant pathogens. Found on the mucous membranes and the human skin of around a third of the population, it is extremely adaptable to antibiotic pressure. It was one of the earlier bacteria in which penicillin resistance was found‚Äîin 1947, just four years after the drug started being mass-produced. Methicillin was then the antibiotic of choice, but has since been replaced by oxacillin because of significant kidney toxicity. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was first detected in Britain in 1961, and is now \\"quite common\\" in hospitals. MRSA was responsible for 37% of fatal cases of sepsis in the UK in 1999, up from 4% in 1991. Half of all S. aureus infections in the US are resistant to penicillin, methicillin, tetracycline and erythromycin. = Streptococcus = Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus: GAS) infections can usually be treated with many different antibiotics. Strains of S. pyogenes resistant to macrolide antibiotics have emerged; however, all strains remain uniformly susceptible to penicillin. Resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillin and other beta-lactams is increasing worldwide. The major mechanism of resistance involves the introduction of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. Selective pressure is thought to play an important role, and use of beta- lactam antibiotics has been implicated as a risk factor for infection and colonization. S. pneumoniae is responsible for pneumonia, bacteremia, otitis media, meningitis, sinusitis, peritonitis and arthritis.  Gram negative  =Campylobacter= Campylobacter causes diarrhea (often bloody), fever, and abdominal cramps. Serious complications such as temporary paralysis can also occur. Physicians rely on ciprofloxacin and azithromycin for treating patients with severe disease although Campylobacter is showing resistance to these antibiotics. =Neisseria gonorrhoeae= Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a sexually transmitted pathogen that causes gonorrhea, a sexually transmitted disease that can result in discharge and inflammation at the urethra, cervix, pharynx, or rectum. It can cause pelvic pain, pain on urination, penile and vaginal discharge, as well as systemic symptoms. It can also cause severe reproductive complications. = Gamma proteobacteria =  Enterobacteriaceae  As of 2013 hard-to-treat or untreatable infections of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), also known as carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), were increasing among patients in medical facilities. CRE are resistant to nearly all available antibiotics. Almost half of hospital patients who get bloodstream CRE infections die from the infection. =Klebsiella pneumoniae= Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing bacteria are a group of emerging highly drug-resistant Gram- negative bacilli causing infections associated with significant morbidity and mortality whose incidence is rapidly increasing in a variety of clinical settings around the world. Klebsiella pneumoniae includes numerous mechanisms for antibiotic resistance, many of which are located on highly mobile genetic elements. Carbapenem antibiotics (heretofore often the treatment of last resort for resistant infections) are generally not effective against KPC- producing organisms. =Salmonella and E. coli= Infection with Escherichia coli and Salmonella can result from the consumption of contaminated food and polluted water. Both of these bacteria are well known for causing nosocomial (hospital-linked) infections, and often, these strains found in hospitals are antibiotic resistant because of adaptations to wide spread antibiotic use. When both bacteria are spread, serious health conditions arise. Many people are hospitalized each year after becoming infected, with some dying as a result. Since 1993, some strains of E. coli have become resistant to multiple types of fluoroquinolone antibiotics. Although mutation alone plays a huge role in the development of antibiotic resistance, a 2008 study found that high survival rates after exposure to antibiotics could not be accounted for by mutation alone. This study focused on the development of resistance in E. coli to three antibiotic drugs: ampicillin, tetracycline, and nalidixic acid. The researchers found that some antibiotic resistance in E. coli developed because of epigenetic inheritance rather than by direct inheritance of a mutated gene. This was further supported by data showing that reversion to antibiotic sensitivity was relatively common as well. This could only be explained by epigenetics. Epigenetics is a type of inheritance in which gene expression is altered rather than the genetic code itself. There are many modes by which this alteration of gene expression can occur, including methylation of DNA and histone modification; however, the important point is that both inheritance of random mutations and epigenetic markers can result in the expression of antibiotic resistance genes. Resistance to polymyxins first appear in 2011. An easier way for this resistance to spread, a plasmid known as MCR-1 was discovered in 2015.  Pseudomonadales  Acinetobacter Acinetobacter is a gram-negative bacteria that causes pneumonia or bloodstream infections in critically ill patients. Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter have become very resistant to antibiotics. On November 5, 2004, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported an increasing number of Acinetobacter baumannii bloodstream infections in patients at military medical facilities in which service members injured in the Iraq/Kuwait region during Operation Iraqi Freedom and in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom were treated. Most of these showed multidrug resistance (MRAB), with a few isolates resistant to all drugs tested. =Pseudomonas aeruginosa= Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a highly prevalent opportunistic pathogen. One of the most worrisome characteristics of P. aeruginosa is its low antibiotic susceptibility, which is attributable to a concerted action of multidrug efflux pumps with chromosomally encoded antibiotic resistance genes (e.g., mexAB-oprM, mexXY) and the low permeability of the bacterial cellular envelopes. P. aeruginosa has the ability to produce 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (HAQs) and it has been found that HAQs have prooxidant effects, and overexpressing modestly increased susceptibility to antibiotics. The study experimented with the P. aeruginosa biofilms and found that a disruption of relA and spoT genes produced an inactivation of the Stringent response (SR) in cells with nutrient limitation, which provides cells be more susceptible to antibiotics.

D. Asante is a Ghanaian engineer and international consultant for the gas and oil industry. He is a graduate of Mfantsipim School and Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. He is the Chief Executive Officer of the Ghana National Gas Company. Early life and education Benjamin Asante is an Asante-Akyem from Juansa and was born in Kumasi in the Ashanti Region of Ghana to Kwasi Aninakwa-Asante and Gladys Mensah. He attended the Bantama/Asokwa Presby primary schools, and State Experimental and City of Kumasi middle schools. Upon passing his common entrance exam, he was admitted into Mfantsipim School in Cape Coast, where he obtained his GCE Ordinary Level and GCE Advanced Level certificates in science. He proceeded to Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in chemical engineering. He later enrolled at the University of Calgary, Canada, where he pursued a Master's degree in chemical engineering. He also completed a joint dissertation on Multiphase (Oil and Gas) Flow at Imperial College London and the University of Calgary and obtained a PhD in chemical engineering. Career Upon graduating from university in 1984, Asante was posted to the National Industrial Company in Kumasi for his national service. He has worked for major operating companies as well as engineering consulting companies in Canada, the US, and Ghana in various technical and management roles. He has also provided engineering services, project management, and technical support for projects throughout the world, including Abu Dhabi, Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Ghana, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Russia, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, and the US. He has also provided consulting services to the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. Asante has taught gas processing and pipeline engineering to graduate students at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and Imperial College, London. His expertise was brought to the fore after 2007 when Ghana discovered oil in commercial quantities. He was the technical director of Ghana's first gas infrastructure project and also developed the first gas infrastructure and utilization master plan for Ghana in 2008. His work profile includes periods at Nova-TransCanada, Jacobs Engineering, and Enron. Whilst at Enron, he was adjudged the Best Employee for exhibiting respect, innovation, and excellence in 2001. Asante was one of only five Africans to be invited by the United States Department of Energy to help author a book on natural gas and liquefied natural gas. He was an expert witness in the resolution of the gas custody dispute between Bolivia and Brazil in 2004. He has advised on, developed, and evaluated several oil and gas projects around the world. =Ghana Gas appointment= In January 2017, President Nana Akufo-Addo appointed him as acting CEO of Ghana Gas. Asante replaced George Yankey, who had asked for a terminal leave from the Board of Ghana Gas. Upon his appointment, some groups in the Nzema area, where the operations of Ghana Gas are situated, questioned the president's decision to appoint Asante. According to one of the groups, they were of the view that Asante had superintended many controversial deals whilst he was consulting for the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation. They asked that more information be released on all deals that Asante may have been involved in so they could assess for themselves if he had played any negative role in them. Based on these allegations, other groups rose in support of the president's appointee. They believed that the groups opposing the president's appointee had preferred the appointment to have gone to one Kaku Sagary Nokoe, a native of the Nzema area. In February 2017, Awulae Agyevi Kwame II, Paramount chief of Nsein, who had been leading calls for the president to cancel the appointment of Asante, pledged to work with him, conceding defeat in his bid to get a native of the land to be appointed to the position.

One of Hitler's favoured analysts in the Abwehr, von Roenne was not directly involved in the plot but was nonetheless tried and executed in the aftermath of the plot thanks to links with many of the conspirators. Life A veteran of the First World War, von Roenne rose through German intelligence to head Foreign Armies West (Fremde Heere West), the branch of the Abwehr tasked with espionage on the Western Front. Referred to by modern historians as 'Hitler's favourite intelligence analyst'. However, a staunch Christian with beliefs at odds with the Nazi Party, historians believe that he led a double life by deliberately misleading Hitler and the German general staff. A key promoter of intelligence gained from British campaigns like Operation Mincemeat (the deception plan for the Allied invasion of Sicily) and Operation Bodyguard (disguising the intended target of the Normandy landings), his actions may have helped to save thousands of lives. Death Arrested in the immediate aftermath of the July 20 plot thanks to his connection with several of those responsible but released shortly afterwards, von Roenne was rearrested on 9 August and tried before Roland Freisler's People's Court on 5 October. Declaring that Nazi race policies were inconsistent with his Christian values, he was found guilty by the show trial and hanged on a meat hook at Pl√∂tzensee Prison on 12 October. His final epitaph to his wife reflected his faith, stating 'in a moment now I shall be going home to our Lord in complete calm and in the certainty of salvation.' Background information A new movie about Operation Mincemeat, to begin pre-production in 2019, uses a screenplay, written by Michelle Ashford, based on historian Ben Macintyre's 2010 book Operation Mincemeat. The book provides additional specifics about the involvement of von Roenne in the ruse played on the Germans during the Second World War by the British. Forged \\"documents\\" claimed that the Allies would invade Greece and Sardinia before the invasion of Sicily, leading Germany to divest important assets to that area. The Baron was said to have vouched for the authenticity of the documents and also accepted other hoaxes used by the Allies during the war. According to Macintyre, > \\"he faithfully passed on every deception ruse fed to him, accepted the > existence of every bogus unit regardless of evidence, and inflated forty- > four divisions in Britain to an astonishing eighty-nine.\\" A report published by The Independent adds additional perspective on von Roenne's work during the war. > \\"Colonel Baron Alexis von Roenne, in charge of Fremde Heere West (FHW), the > western intelligence arm, who had built his reputation on predicting Allied > behaviour early in the war, was wrong on almost every important count other > than to discount an invasion of Norway.

He served between 1994 and 2000 as president of the regional office for protection of the constitution in Thuringia (\\"Th√ºringer Landesamtes f√ºr Verfassungsschutz\\"). This is a state-level security agency. Controversy in respect of his time in office has persisted, although he himself robustly rejects most of the criticisms of his decisions made at that time.  Life  = Early years = Helmut Roewer was born in Verona. He trained for service as an officer in a West German tank regiment, rising to the rank of Oberleutnant. He then went on to study jurisprudence, History and applied economics (\\"Volkswirtschaft\\"). He completed his studies to the point of passing his level two national law exams. He went on to receive his doctorate in 1982 from the University of Konstanz. His dissertation was entitled \\"Rechte und Pflichten junger Menschen zwischen Elternrecht und staatlicher Einflussnahme ‚Äì Die Entwicklung von der Reichsgr√ºndung 1871 bis 1980\\" (loosely \\"Rights and obligations of young people between parental rights and government inputs ... 1981-1980\\"). Initially he then worked in public practice as a lawyer. Later he took a job in the West German Interior Ministry, working in areas involving Constitutional Protection (security) and reaching the level of a \\"Ministerialrat\\" (loosely: \\"permanent secretary\\"). = Presidency of the \\"Th√ºringer Landesamtes f√ºr Verfassungsschutz\\" = In 1994 the Thuringian Interior Minister, Franz Schuster offered Roewer a position as president of the regional office for protection of the constitution (\\"Th√ºringer Landesamtes f√ºr Verfassungsschutz\\"). Roewer accepted. The written certificate of employment was apparently placed in Roewer's pocket in an Erfurt hostelry. Details of the exchange can no longer be reconstructed: Roewer later indicated that he was drunk at the time and retained only a dim recollection of what happened. There were suggestions that the manner in which Roewer carried out his responsibilities could be seen as eccentric. On one occasion he turned up to an event celebrating Weimar as a European Capital of Culture dressed in a General Ludendorff costume, complete with a spiked helmet: another time he appeared at a ceremony in a carriage dressed up as Walther Rathenau. On Roewer's watch a number of people believed to be linked to right-wing radicalism in the area were recruited as informants. An example was Tino Brandt, at that time a commander in the Thurinigian Homeland Protection League and a member of the regional executive of the National Democratic Party (\\" Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / NPD). Between 1994 and 2001 Brandt received more than 200,000 Marks for his services, money which by his own account went to the Homeland Protection League. Brandt himself was at one stage delisted, on account of his extremist involvement, by Roewer.Stefan Aust, Dirk Laabs: Heimatschutz. Der Staat und die Mordserie des NSU. Pantheon Verlag M√ºnchen 2014, p. 434 In 1998 three members of the Neo-Nazi scene in the area disappeared \\"underground\\". That became more significant during the next ten or so years, as the three were identified as \\"Nazi underground\\" suspects in connection with a long list of murders of Turkish and Greek immigrants, the murder of a police officer in Heilbronn, terrorist explosions and a number of bank robberies. Commenting on 15 November 2011. Roewer stated that back at the time \\"because of numerous operation in process, and of the [quantity of] papers involved, it is possible that individual clues [which should have been] recognised were not\\".Christian Bergmann, Heiner Hoffmann, Inga Klees & Marcus Weller: Welche Rolle spielt der Verfassungsschutz? In: Fakt. broadcast by the MDR, 15 November 2011 In a letter to Interior Minister J√∂rg Geibert, Roewer wrote that there had been a \\"very strong suspicion\\" (eine \\"sehr ernste Vermutung\\") of irregularities in the local police department as a result of which \\"information from there to the [suspects] in question could have passed\\" (\\"dass Informationen von dort an die Betroffenen abflie√üen k√∂nnten\\"). He thought connections between the terror cell involved and police in Jena could have already prevented an arrest as early as 1998. In February 2013 Roewer took his argument a little further, stating that his office had opened an investigation against the police. When pressed for more details he said that the files from his time in office had probably been destroyed, however. Under Roewer's leadership the \\"Th√ºringer Landesamtes f√ºr Verfassungsschutz\\" (security service) was far more worried about the dangers of left-wing extremism than those of right-wing extremism. An educational film produced for schools in 2000 characterised left-wing autonomists as ready to commit violence, while marches in the streets of right wingers were identified as reassuringly comradely affairs. A statement was included from the Thurinigian Homeland Protection League leader, Tino Brandt, \\"We are essentially against violence\\" (\\"Wir sind [‚Ä¶] prinzipiell gegen Gewalt\\"), completely without further elaboration or challenge. That film was commissioned by the short- lived Heron Verlagsgesellschaft (\\"Heron Publishing Company\\") - described in one source as a \\"Tarnverlag\\" (\\"camouflage publisher\\") - which had been set up by Roewer himself, albeit using \\"Stephan Seeberg\\" as a cover name! The contract for the film's production went to the ambitious young media-savvy CDU activist, Reyk Seela. Roewer justified his unconventional approach to commissioning and producing the educational film by explaining that it had facilitated the incorporation of film-clips and images provided from the \\"radical right-wing scene\\". Another contentious aspect of Roewer's time in charge at the \\"Verfassungsschutz\\" office concerned the massive gathering of material on the opposition politician Bodo Ramelow. It never became clear why this had been done. In October 2013 the (national) Federal Constitutional Court found the surveillance under which Ramelow had been placed had been unconstitutional. In 2000 the Interior Minister, Christian K√∂ckert, asked the former judge and Secretary of state at the Hessian Justice Ministry, Karl Heinz Gasser, to conduct an enquiry into Roewer's conduct of his office. Gasser's report was devastating. Roewer's personnel appointments had been appalling, both in terms of leadership and of organisational structure, in the course of his reconfiguration of his office between 1994 and 1999. He had placed school leavers in leadership positions which had created conditions of permanent conflict between experienced intelligence administrators and their new bosses. An example was cited of an experienced official who had criticised a decision of his boss as nonsensical, and been personally sanctioned by Roewer who had ordered him to provide an hour by hour record of his working day. Professional supervision by the Interior Ministry was effectively blocked for almost a year while Roewer failed to report on his activities to the minister, instead reporting solely to the minister's predecessor, Richard Dewes. No minutes or other report of those discussions were provided to the responsible oversight board regarding the content of the information provided by Roewer at his meetings with Dewes. There was also criticism of the current Interior Minister, Christian K√∂ckert, for having failed to react to a letter from the personnel office warning of the chaotic situation in the \\"Verfassungsschutz\\" office under Roewer's direction. While that was going on there was also a commission of enquiry in place, which had been set up by the Landtag of Thuringia, into the activities in the area of the National Socialist Underground, and which came up with repeated criticism of the way Roewer's office was carrying out its security brief. The point was made that where he found one of his section heads impossible to handle, he should have immediately dismissed such an individual. = Retirement and criminal proceedings = In 2000, as a result of \\"more than sixty matters\\", Helmut Roewer was suspended from office by the minister-president, Bernhard Vogel. A criminal investigation was launched in 2005 in respect of suspected malfeasancesThe German word used is \\"Untreue\\" which literally indicates infidelity or disloyalty during his time as president of the regional office for protection of the constitution (\\"Th√ºringer Landesamtes f√ºr Verfassungsschutz\\"). However, the investigations were suspended in 2008 due to \\"long-standing unfitness\\" (\\"fortdauernder Verhandlungsunf√§higkeit\\") provisions. In 2010 a deal was concluded with the Erfurt district court as a result of which the criminal proceedings were permanently halted and Roewer, by this time described as an \\"author, living in Weimar and Italy\\" paid 3,000 Euros to an agreed charity. = NSU affair = Despite the threat of criminal conviction having been lifted, Roewer was still called upon to testify to parliamentary commissions of enquiry into the handing of the National Socialist Underground affair (\\"NSU murders\\"). As a witness he was neither willing nor co-operative: at one stage, in an interview reported in 2013, Roewer compared his appearances before one enquiry commission to a Stalinist show trial. He filed two criminal complaints against former colleagues on grounds of alleged false testimony. Summononed to testify before the first Bundestag (i.e. national parliamentary) committee of enquiry into the National Socialist Underground murders, Roewer was asked about an invoice that had been found for a payment to someone identified as \\"V-Mann G√ºnther\\" (\\"trusted informant G√ºnther\\") Instead of attempting to answer the committee member's question, Roewer replied \\"Was geht Sie das an?\\" (loosely \\"What business is that of yours?\\") There had in fact been several payments to \\"V-Mann G√ºnther\\", and Roewer's dismissive reaction on being quizzed about the matter encouraged speculation that he could have had reasons of his own for apparently holding back from giving direct answers on the topic. He told the committee that attempts had been made by the service during his time in charge of it to organise false passports for Uwe B√∂hnhardt, Uwe Mundlos and Beate Zsch√§pe in order to have them arrested as they left Germany. These three were the terrorist suspects whose allegedly murderous activities during the first decade of the twenty-first century had triggered the parliamentary enquiry. Roewer's testimony that Thuringian \\"Verfassungsschutz\\" officers had engaged in drinking sessions with right-wing extremists in order to extract information from them failed to impress his questioners or media commentators. Roewer nevertheless strongly rejected suggestions that he had become a protector for the NSU suspects. Roewer had originally declined to appear before the committee of enquiry because he was ill. When the committee demanded a medical certificate, he turned up to the hearings, but armed with a certificate from a doctor indicating that he needed a fifteen-minute break every 30-45 minutes. In the end he testified without those regular breaks. His relationship with the committee evidently remained starkly confrontational, however. The committee chairman, Sebastian Edathy went on record with the opinion that Roewer's memory lapses in response to questioning were \\"simply not believable\\" (\\"schlicht nicht glaubw√ºrdig\\"). = Author, journalist and pundit = Roewer still sustains a significant public profile, with regular media appearances. He contributes to J√ºrgen Els√§sser's monthly Compact magazine and as an author for Ares-Verlag. He strongly rejects charges that this publishing firm is a platform for right-wing extremists, antisemites and historical revisionists. He points out that he has found his former tutor, Ingo von M√ºnch, on its list of authors, asserting that a publishing house that is good enough for the respectable von M√ºnch is good enough for him. Roewer also contributes to Junge Freiheit and is involved at a senior level with the Dresden-based Veldenstein Circle (\\"Veldensteiner Research Group on Extremism and Democracy\\" / \\"Veldensteiner Kreis zur Erforschung von Extremismus und Demokratie\\").

The community consists of two San tribes, the !Xun and the Khwe. ‚ÄúThe San of Platfontein‚Äù is a collective name used for both the !Xun and Khwe.

They had been part of the Flechas, a unit of the Portuguese Special Forces. With the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) assuming power in Angola in November 1975, many joined the South African National Defence Force In the South African National Defence Force, these San soldiers were part of 31 Battalion (SWATF) fighting at a base called Omega, located in the Western Caprivi, the Zambezi region of Namibia, on the Namibian border with Angola. ‚ÄúThe San of Platfontein‚Äù were involved in counter-insurgency operations during the South African Border War. This war was between the South African Defence Force, in alliance with the South-West Africa Territory Force, against the People‚Äôs Liberation Army of Namibia, the active military wing of SWAPO. The conflict spanned a period, from 1966 to 1989. This war service was not always voluntary: in 1998 the Truth and Reconciliation Commission heard several first-hand accounts of forced conscription and brutal treatment of men in the battalion.Palmer, C. ‚ÄúThe History of the !Xun and Khwe‚Äù Kalahari People‚Äôs Network.

Accessed 19 November In Schmidtsdrift they lived in makeshift army tents. The land on which the San were living at Schmidtsdrift formed part of the ancestral lands of ethnic Tswana, Bathlaping and a group of Griqua people. The claim to the land by these groups was approved in April 2000, and the San of Schmidtsdrift had to be relocated. They were relocated to Platfontein where they reside today in a small community. Before the !Xun and Khwe were relocated to Platfontein, it was abandoned farmland. Under the Land Redistribution Programme, the Department of Land Affairs identified Platfontein as possible land to settle the !Xun and the Khwe people. In May 1999, former South African President Nelson Mandela presented the community with the title deed for this land.\\"Slim Hopes of Homes for San People\\" South African Press Association, 2001 The residents of Platfontein number about 7 000 people. They live in low-income, government-built Reconstruction and Development Programme housing. Since being handed over by the Department of Housing, these RDP houses have not all been provided with proper water, sanitation and electricity by the Sol Plaatje Local Municipality. Despite being relocated and settled together, the !Xun and Khwe have chosen to live in different parts of the settlement due to differences in the community; in Platfontein the basic services that are available are a school, two shops, a municipal building and a health clinic which both the !Xun and Khwe share \\"Field Work and research among San Youth in South Africa\\" Juvonen, T. 2017Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Lapland.

Traditionally the San, lived a mobile life closely associated with the seasonal availability of water supplies. The San of Platfontein are traditionally nomadic, moving around in search of food and making temporary dwellings. Being in permanent homes has disrupted this traditional way of life.

A shoemaker who joined the gold rush and returned to become a taxidermist. He also surveyed parts of British Columbia and several places including Fannin Range, Fannin Lake, and Fannin Creek are named after him. Ovis fannini was named after him but it is now considered a color variant of the Dall sheep Ovis dalli. Fannin was born in Kemptville, Ontario to William Fannin, tailor, and Eliza, who were of Irish origin. He may have taught at schools like his sister but little is known of his early life. He was a shoemaker for a while before joining the gold rush in British Columbia. He joined Thomas McMicking and they traveled overland through Fort Garry and Fort Edmonton to reach Kamloops through difficult terrain. Several men died and Fannin had to rely on his knowledge of the wilderness and survival skills to live with almost nothing. His attempts at mining and ranching in the Kamloops area were not successful and he tried his hand at taxidermy and also at writing. From 1873 to 1899 Fannin worked for the British Columbia government as a contract surveyor to examine farming, mining, logging and settlements in the region. He also served as postmaster at Burrard Inlet (Vancouver) from 1882 and as a justice of the peace for New Westminster district in 1884. He became the first curator of the provincial museum at Victoria in 1886 and worked on natural history. He visited museums in Europe and the United States in 1896, after which time the museum grew much larger, with numerous exhibits and dioramas, into what is now known as the Royal British Columbia Museum. He retired in 1904 due to ill health and died a few months later in June.

It serves passengers between state capital Melbourne, Victoria and the regional city of Bendigo, Victoria. The Bendigo service is the third busiest regional rail service in Victoria (behind Geelong and Ballarat) carrying 2.59 million passengers in the 12 months ended 30 June 2017.  History  The Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company built the line between Melbourne to Bendigo, finishing the fully double track line in 1862. Throughout the early twentieth century, many branch lines were built along the length of the Bendigo line, but by the time V/Line took over Victorian regional passenger services in 1983, the only passengers services still using the Bendigo line corridor were the Swan Hill and Bendigo intercity services. Eventually though, a twice weekly passenger service to Echuca from Melbourne and Bendigo was reinstated in 1996. Under the Regional Fast Rail Project in 2006, the Bendigo line underwent major track upgrades that would allow for Velocity trains to run at speeds of 160km/h between Sunbury and Bendigo. However, between Kyneton and Bendigo the line was singled in order to allow for better clearance past heritage structures, although some double sections were retained in order to create long passing loops. The crossing loops were provided with bidirectional signalling, but only one track of the loop was upgraded for high-speed running. With the Sunbury line's electrification project completed in 2012, Bendigo line trains no longer called at Diggers Rest. In 2014, Epsom station was constructed to serve Bendigo's Northeastern suburbs, it was at first serviced four times daily by extending some services that terminated at Bendigo. On 27 June 2016, three more daily Bendigo V/Line services were also extended to the station of Eaglehawk, on the Swan Hill line. The advent of the Bendigo Metro Rail Project has significantly increased the frequency of trains to Epsom, Eaglehawk as well as Kangaroo Flat stations. On 16 July 2014, V/Line trains between Melbourne and Bendigo ceased stopping at North Melbourne Station as part of the Regional Rail Link project. Over time, the service frequencies on both the Echuca and Swan Hill lines have increased up to two train services a day, with V/Line coach services also providing a relatively frequent service to these cities. In 2020, the Victorian Government announces to propose to rebuild the new Raywood, Goornong and Huntly railway station as part of the Regional Rail Revival project.  Services  Currently, V/Line runs at-least hourly passenger services along the Bendigo line, with additional frequency during peak hours. This frequency is normally inclusive of the trains that run from Swan Hill and Echuca via Bendigo to Melbourne. Additional peak hour services originate and terminate at Kyneton. Most trains terminate at Bendigo, but 7 weekday services continue onto Epsom, and a further 5 onto Eaglehawk. Service frequency between Kyneton and Bendigo is limited due to sections of single track. All passenger train services that terminate within Greater Bendigo (which includes Epsom and Eaglehawk) are run by VLocity DMUs, while some late night services to Bendigo are run by V/Line road coaches. V/Line also operates twice-daily services to both the cities of Swan Hill and Echuca via Bendigo. These services are further supplemented by numerous V/Line road coach services which fill the gaps within the schedule. These services though tend to run as limited expresses in between Bendigo and Melbourne.  Infrastructure  The line to Bendigo was fully double track prior to the Regional Fast Rail project in 2006. Now the line is double track until Kyneton, and is single-track with passing loops until Kangaroo Flat. The track is double between Kangaroo Flat and Bendigo, but single thereafter until Eaglehawk and Epsom.

The Germans, however, bypassed Szczuczyn in their advance eastwards leaving control of the town to the Polish locals.The Encyclopedia of Jewish Life Before and During the Holocaust: Seredina-Buda-Z, Shmuel Spector & Geoffrey Wigoder, page 1276 June Massacre On the night of the 25th of June Jews were murdered by Poles in three incidents. On the 28th of June axe-wielding mobs killed some three hundred Jews in a brutal massacre. The Polish mob killed entire families, focusing on wealthy families, and threw the corpses into anti-tank ditches by the town. The massacre is attested to by Chaye Soika-Golding, a local Jewish survivor, who details the massacre and the efforts of Jewish women to appeal to the local priests and Polish intelligentsia to stop the pogrom, which were refused.Soika-Golding Chaye (1945) How the Jews of Shtutsin (Szczuczyn) Struggled and Suffered Chaye, Golding Letters 23.11.2017 The women finally appealed to a passing German unit, who after receiving soap, coffee, and volunteer work by the women, intervened and halted the pogrom.

Some 600 Jews were murdered in the cemetery, and the surviving Jews were placed in a Ghetto. On 2 November 1942 the Ghetto inhabitants were sent to the Bogusze transit camp, and from there on to Treblinka extermination camp. In August 1941, a group of some 20 Jewish women from the Szczuczyn ghetto were raped, robbed, and killed by their Polish employers while employed in field work in Bzury. In a 1950 trial by communist authorities one man, Stanislaw Zalewski, was sentenced to death (later commuted to prison).

The uniqueness of Chakra is owed to the invention of a new fairy piece named transmitter. Freeling considered an earlier version of the game as insignificant. \\"Then one night in the early eighties, Ed [van Zon] and I dreamed up the 'transmitter', a piece consisting of two parts called 'chakras', that would function as a 'portal' for transmitting pieces.\\" The game was first featured in The Gamer magazine in 1981 (issue 3), resulting in much interest and the sale of many Chakra sets.Pritchard (2007), p. 173 Chakra is included in 100 Other Games to Play on a Chessboard (1983, 2002) by Stephen Addison.  Overview  Chakra is played on a standard chessboard and has many of the standard play conventions as in chess, including check and the winning objective, checkmate. Stalemate, as in chess, is a draw. The king in Chakra is named emperor. Each player starts with 16 pieces: 1 emperor, 1 empress, 1 samurai, 1 monk, 2 monkeys, 2 courtesans, 2 chakras, 6 swords. The emperor, empress, and monkey perform identically to their chess counterparts (king, queen, and knight, respectively). The others are governed by special fairy rules. There is no castling in Chakra.  Move rules  * The samurai combines powers of a chess king and a chess knight. * The monk combines powers of a chess king and a chess bishop. * A courtesan moves and captures like a chess king, but has an additional power: whenever it has an open path to its own emperor along a , , or , it can move or capture along the rank, file, or diagonal in either direction. * A sword moves like a chess pawn, except there is no en passant. It promotes upon reaching the to any previously captured piece, except a chakra.

In 1958, within 5 years, it obtained a Decree of Incorporation from the late Ruler of Dubai and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Rashid Bin Saeed Al Maktoum and is the first Company in Dubai to receive this royal decree .

Even as of 1959, it had only four employees in this small outpost office led by Mr. Murij Manghnani and ran as a subsidiary unit of the Intra Group. In fact, Intra Group was linked to the Chotirmall Group, a large trading corporation established in 1875 and based in Hong Kong, that mainly operated in Asia-Pacific and particularly Japan and South-East Asian markets such as Indonesia and Singapore . During the early 1950s, ITL focussed only on textile business, specializing in textiles imported from the Far East (primarily from Japan, China and India) and exporting them mainly to Iran and the region. Later on, ITL diversified into other businesses such as authorized distributors of products from foreign companies. In 1960, ITL opened its first Cosmos department store in Dubai, that later on became the group's flagship chain of stores . The group had been official distributors of the Japanese brands Sharp, Minolta, Rhythm, Remington Products, and TDK for several decades . In 1970s, the group diversified into hospitality and food business, and later on into IT.

Name  Lilium sherriffiae is named after a Mrs. Sherriff, the wife of a co-leader of the Ludlow-Sherriff expedition. She had accompanied people to the trip Nepal and Bhutan, and had been injured due to a fall. Botanist William Stearn decided to name a newly discovered species after her.  Distribution  Lilium sherriffiae is endemic to the mountainous regions of two countries: Nepal and Bhutan. Information on this species was originally compiled in 1950 by British botanist William T. Stearn in his visit to Bhutan in 1950 in a publication to the Journal of the Royal Horticultural Society.J. Roy. Hort. Soc. 75:192, fig. 108. 1950 Due to its mountainous habitat, Lilium sherriffiae has been recorded at altitudes ranging from 9,000 to 12,000 feet (2,700 to 3,600 meters).  Description  Lilium sherriffiae is a perennial species of lily. Its herbs are very bulbous and has coverings of numerous fleshy scales, each of which are enclosed by a membranous tunic. The bulbs grow up to 2 centimeters in length and with its scales growing up to 0.7 centimeters in width. Its color commonly comes out to yellowish-white. The rooting stems are often 2.5 centimeters, rooting erect. Its stem enables growth varying from 45 to 90 centimeters in height. It grows a single flower; However, 2 flowers are not uncommon to be seen. These flowers are drooping, campanulate, and reddish-brown with a gold chequered pattern as colour. Filaments on these species grow up to 1.9 centimeters in length and the reproductive organs (the anthers) grow up to 1.3 centimeters in height. Its ovaries grow 1.2 centimeters and style grow to 2.8 centimeters in length, all of which are stiffened upwards. Flowers are shaped like funnels and its tepals are often reflexed.

Among other things, this means that emission reductions can be transferred between countries and counted towards NDCs. Agreement on the provisions of Article 6 was reached after intensive negotiations lasting several years.  Overarching goals of Article 6  Voluntary cooperation provided for under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement serves a number of goals. These are outlined below. = Raised ambition = International cooperation under Article 6 is designed to raise ambition. With regard to climate action, this is generally understood as cooperation being used to enable the participating countries to achieve more ambitious emission reduction targets. Worthy of note here is that under the Paris Agreement, the idea of raised ambition is not restricted purely to climate change mitigation. It also includes measures and targets for climate change adaptation. = Supporting sustainable development = The cooperation mechanisms must support sustainable development. While the main focus of cooperation is placed on avoiding greenhouse gas emissions, other sustainability issues must also be addressed. = Ensuring environmental integrity = The cooperative mechanisms must also ensure the environmental integrity of the cooperation and transfer process. That means that the mechanisms may not be used to circumvent climate action ambition in the countries involved. For example, the transfer of emission reductions from one country to another must not lead to the countries‚Äô respective climate action efforts being any less than they would be without the cooperative mechanism.  Three approaches to international cooperation  The Paris Agreement offers three ways in which Parties may cooperate on a voluntary basis. = Article 6.2: Cooperative Approaches = Article 6.2 enables Parties to cooperate with one another directly without using an international mechanism. For example, climate change mitigation activities can be implemented in one country and the resulting emission reductions can be transferred to another country and counted towards its nationally determined contribution (NDC). In addition to the requirement to promote sustainable development and ensure environmental integrity, use of Article 6.2 also requires transparent processes and accurate accounting of emission reductions achieved. The latter is designed to prevent emission reductions being counted more than once ‚Äì for example, towards the environmental audit of the country in which the climate action took place and also of the country to which the emission reductions were transferred. Article 6.2 could be used in a situation where national or regional instruments such as the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) are linked with comparable systems in order to create a common, cross-border carbon market. National and bilateral carbon credit-based systems operated outside the realm of the UNFCCC could also be used under Article 6.2. At the climate change conference in Paris, a working programme was adopted to develop guidelines on using this cooperation form. = Article 6.4: Mechanism to promote climate action and support sustainable development = Another approach to international cooperation involves the use of the newly-developed mechanism to contribute to the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and support sustainable development (Article 6.4). In contrast to the instruments used in direct bilateral cooperation, this mechanism is supervised by a body commissioned by the Conference of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (COP). The COP will also adopt rules, processes and procedures which must be complied with when implementing activities under Article 6.4 This will ensure that both design and implementation of climate change mitigation activities as well as the verification of the emission reductions achieved meet standardised requirements. As with bilateral cooperation under Article 6.2, emission reductions achieved with the Article 6.4 mechanism in one country can be transferred to another country and counted towards its NDC. Like the other forms of cooperation under Article 6, these activities must contribute to raised ambition and support sustainable development. One particular feature of the mechanism contained in Article 6.4 is the explicit goal of contributing to global emission reductions (Article 6.4 (d)). The activities conducted under Article 6.4 should not therefore result in a simple zero-sum game, as was the case with the Clean Development Mechanism, its predecessor mechanism, and must instead lead to an absolute reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions overall. Yet another feature of the mechanism is the goal of involving private sector stakeholders in climate change mitigation activities (Article 6.4 (b)). This will be done by offering suitable incentives. The approach gives non- state actors the opportunity to make use of the mechanism contained in Article 6.4. = Article 6.8: Non-market-based approaches = As a third option, Article 6.8 allows the use of non-market-based approaches. As the name clearly suggests, market-based climate change mechanisms play no role whatsoever in this approach. While the other two approaches focus on cooperation in implementing climate action, the range of opportunities for cooperation under Article 6.8 is significantly broader. In addition to climate action and climate change adaptation, they also cover technology transfer and capacity- building measures. How these approaches are to work has still to be agreed ‚Äì the details will be fleshed out over the next few years in the development of a framework for non-market-based approaches.  Open issues and current negotiations  In Paris, the Parties agreed on a rough framework and goals for the cooperative mechanisms. How these goals are to be achieved and how the mechanisms are expected to work remains unclear. Both are being addressed in the current climate change negotiations which are shaped by differing political standpoints and numerous open issues concerning technical matters, structure and design. = Open issues = One key issue involves the extent to which activities conducted under Article 6 are to be regulated and monitored. While some countries (such as Brazil and also the EU) call for Article 6 activities to be subject to stringent rules and monitored and overseen by a centralised institution, others (such as Japan, China and India) would like to see greater flexibility. Differing standpoints exist as to the scope of applicability of the mechanism to promote climate action and support sustainable development contained in Article 6.4. While some countries, including Brazil, would like to see a continuation of the project-based approach used under the CDM, others are in favour of a broader-based mechanism that also takes in programmes and sectoral approaches. The situation in other areas is less clear: discussions are still underway as to what the non-market- based approach actually entails and how it can be distinguished from existing forms of cooperation. An element of progress has been made in this regard, for example with the identification of activities which could benefit from the approach, including the withdrawal of subsidies for fossil fuels. Apart from the issues outline above, there are also technical matters that must be addressed. One such issue is the linkage of Article 6 with the transparency framework of the Paris Agreement and the reporting requirements regarding the use of Article 6. Hence, countries using Article 6 will have to submit an additional layer of information. Other issues include the establishment and use of robust accounting rules for transferred emission reductions. The differences in the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) submitted by Parties to the Paris Agreement highlight the challenges faced: to prevent transferred emission reductions from being counted more than once and thus undermining the environmental integrity of the Paris Agreement, reductions which are exported from one country and counted towards another country‚Äôs NDC must be deducted from the exporting country‚Äôs national emissions budget. However, if the two countries have differing NDCs, for example with differing target years, then robust accounting could well be rendered impossible. These and other technical matters must be clarified before the mechanisms can be used. = Outlook = Following the adoption of the Paris Agreement, the task now at hand is to flesh out the details regarding the design and structure of the cooperation mechanisms. At the climate change conference in Marrakesh in 2016, Parties exchanged their views and opinions regarding the role of Article 6 and identified those areas in which a consensus had been reached and where a common understanding had still to be agreed. A key element in that process is the opportunity for Parties to submit their standpoint in the form of ‚Äúsubmissions‚Äù to the UNFCCC. After the first round of submissions in the lead up to COP22, it was agreed in Marrakesh to introduce a further round of submissions which would be used as the basis for the next round of climate change negotiations during the interim sessions in Bonn. The submissions displayed a wide range of views, which challenged the negotiations on this issue at the UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn in November 2017. Although a large number of controversial topics and open issues remain even after the negotiations in Bonn, all the proposals are now available in written, structured form, showing where the key areas of consensus and contention are. At COP23, the co-chairs of the working group were tasked with producing an informal note, which were revised at the first part of the SBSTA negotiation session in Bonn (SBSTA 48) in April and May 2018. Parties agreed to use the revised informal notes to further advance the negotiations. Between now and spring 2018, these will be used to draft a proposal for a consolidated text which could take the negotiations a significant step further. Time is of the essence in this regard: in Marrakesh, it was agreed that the Paris Agreement rule book should be adopted at COP 24 at the end of 2018 (Decision 1/CP.22, para 12).

The scheme was an initiative of schools secretary Ed Balls in June 2008, during Gordon Brown's Labour administration. 631 secondary schools where less than 30% of students achieved five A*-Cs in GCSEs including English and maths were named. Ed Balls said \\"the government would get all schools past that benchmark by 2011\\" and announced a ¬£400m-plus budget. Each school was given an adviser, and encouragement to join with stronger schools, to form a trust, or become an academy. Legal detail A trust school is a foundation school with a charitable trust. It can be primary or secondary or a special school. It is likely to be grouped with other local schools or with other schools with similar specialities. It is funded like other maintained schools, but has legal powers to establish its own admissions policy, directly employ staff and take controls of its assets, land and buildings. The trust must be set up as a charity and is not allowed to make a profit from the school. It may be the charitable arm of a single private company or body but could also have many external partners such as other companies, higher or further education institutions, charities or voluntary groups. Companies involved in gambling, alcohol, tobacco and pornography were ruled out. Trusts could have multi- school and local authority membership. The trust is not obliged, or even expected, to make a financial contribution to the school(s), unlike some academy school sponsors, but have seats on the school governing body. Rationale The government saw a benefit in bringing in outside expertise. The government encouraged universities and the cooperative movement to get involved. Pressure was put on local authorities to facilitate the transfers, by asking questions about local National Challenge Schools when applications for Building Schools for the Future funding applications were made. The Process Schools were allocated a local authority or trust advisor, who would work with the Senior Management Team to create a RAP, a strategic plan, which would encourage a clearer focus on setting key priorities, and review progress by the use of clearly defined objectives, milestones and outcomes. Middle managers would be challenged to report fortnightly on how their department was implementing this plan. It involved tight monitoring and data capture on individual pupils. The RAP is seen as the key driver of change and improves the quality of dialogue between head teachers, senior leaders and middle managers. This is helped by government produced training materials. The process should lead to schools * prioritising improved attainment rates in 5+ A*-C grades including English and maths; * identifying a set of priorities based on a clearer assessment of current strengths and weaknesses; * having greater levels of agreement among senior leadership teams on school priorities; * increasing the use of tracking data to map in-school variations which willidentify cohorts of pupils that require extra support; * effective use of interventions. The National Strategies Evaluation of National Strategies‚Äô Programmes of Support to Schools in the National Challenge, Louise Stark, 2010 Criticism 'Naming and Shaming' was rejected by educational professionals. The National Union of Teachers has rejected the government's rationale and the threat of closing these 638 schools - and says that these schools are often performing well in the \\"toughest areas\\". The NASUWT rejected the \\"focus on failure and closure\\". Chris Keates said, these \\"are not failing schools. They have simply not yet met, for a variety of reasons, a series of arbitrary numerical targets in certain subjects but with more support will continue on their way to doing so\\". \\"It is entirely wrong for these 638 schools to be described in the media as failing. As the government has acknowledged, many of them are on a rising tide of achievement under their existing leadership,\\" said Dr Dunford, a representative of headteachers. In a briefing paper, deposited in the House of Commons Library, Paul Bolton of the Institute of Education examines the statistics. He shows that the number of schools below the arbitrary watershed has been falling since statistics were collected in 2004, and individual schools have risen above and fallen back, while new schools have fallen in. \\"Compared to the other secondaries these schools have a more deprived intake and well above average levels of special educational needs. When such factors are taken into account, only a minority of these schools perform significantly below average.

Together, these two systems provide information regarding the location and status of the limbs, organs, and the remainder of the body to the central nervous system (CNS) via nerves and ganglia present outside of the spinal cord and brain. The somatic nervous system directs all voluntary movements of the skeletal muscles, and can be sub-divided into afferent and efferent neuronal flow. The autonomic nervous system is divided primarily into the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems with a third system, the enteric nervous system, receiving less recognition.  Autonomic nervous system  = History = In 1898, British scientist John Newport Langley first coined the term \\"autonomic\\" in classifying the connections of nerve fibers to peripheral nerve cells. Previous researchers had utilized different terms such as \\"the sympathetic nerves\\" [Winslow et al.] to describe the way in which neurons in one part of the body brought about sympathetic reactions in another part of the body, as well as the \\"ganglionic nerves and ganglionic nervous system\\" [Livingstone et al.] for the ganglionic conversion of voluntary to involuntary movements (which supposedly made these peripheral nerves 'ganglionic nerves'), among other classifications. Langley stated that his choice of autonomic was not intended to imply a special degree of independence for the cells at hand, but rather to demarcate a clear departure from previous nomenclature because his hypothesis, while incorporating much previous research, was largely distinct from his predecessors. Langley rejected that the sympathetic nerves possessed a particular relationship to the 'sympathies,' and aptly pointed out that the presence of ganglial nerves in both the spinal cord and cranium made the 'ganglionic' connections of the peripheral nerves a pointless, if not misleading, term. Instead, he noted that the sympathetic neurons that innervated the entire body tended to have opposing functions to the other autonomic neurons of the tectal and bulbo-sacral regions. The latter two, tectal and bulbo-sacral, were grouped together to form the parasympathetic system because they tended to respond in a like manner to various drugs. Langley also mentions an enteric nervous system in his writing, but this third grouping has largely fallen out of discussion in modern practice.Langley's Classification Tree from his 1921 book The Autonomic Nervous System = Classification techniques =  Traditional techniques  Much of the original nerve classification done by Langley, and Gaskell by extension, was based on pharmacological responses of nerves throughout the body as well as the gross anatomical similarities of nerves. For example, adrenaline was demonstrated to elicit the same bodily effects as direct electrical stimulation of the sympathetic neurons, and other classes of drugs likewise elicited responses that were contained to the parasympathetic neurons. The sympathetic nervous system's responsiveness to adrenaline, in particular, lead to the system's association with the 'fight or flight' response of humans, although this is an oversimplification of the roles played by the SNS. These two distinct classifications were further supported by differences in the location of the ganglionic synapses. Since the time of Langley's unified proposal in the 1920s, these divisions have remained relatively constant; the parasympathetic nervous system is known to regulate unconscious activities of the body and maintain homeostasis, the sympathetic nervous system controls responses to external stimuli, but both are involuntary functions. Langley also described an enteric nervous system although it has received minimal attention, and most modern textbooks tend to only mention the sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways in the context of the autonomic nervous system.  Modern techniques  The nerve classifications of the autonomic nervous system created by the traditional methodologies have remained mostly unchanged over the last 100 years. However, modern perspectives have placed more of an emphasis on the developmental and molecular mechanisms of these systems. As such, more attention has been paid to elements such as gene expression, development features, and overall functions of these neurons. The classification of the sacral outflow as parasympathetic, in particular, has come under some scrutiny as of 2016. Isabel Espinosa-Medina, working in the lab of French researcher Jean-Fran√ßois Brunet at IBENS, identified several transcription factors within pre-ganglionic neurons of the lower lumbar and sacral regions that are essential to neurogenesis. These transcription factors were only identified within other portions of the spinal cord, but they were not co-expressed in the developing cranium. This genomic similarity of the lumbrasacral region to the rest of the spinal cord lead to the conclusion that the sacral region of the spinal cord may actually be part of the sympathetic nervous system. The effect of this revision produces a simple bisection of the autonomic nervous system wherein the cranium is solely parasympathetic, and the spinal cord is solely sympathetic. Other researchers in the field have challenged this assertion. A publication out of the lab of German researcher Wilfrid J√§nig claims that this reclassification would be a 'mistake.' Among the arguments made by J√§nig et al. is a disagreement with the developmental research approach taken by Espinosa-Medina. J√§nig et al. argue that many of the measured gene markers from Espinosa-Medina are only expressed transiently in the lumbrasacral region to assist in migration and differentiation of these cells. As such, these nerves necessarily share expression similarities with their neighboring sympathetic spinal nerves, but that alone does not make the nerves anything more than spinal in nature. Furthermore, J√§nig et al. state that this reclassification would contradict information on the opposing actions of the pelvic ganglia's parasympathetic and sympathetic pathways. = Sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions = Disregarding the current debate of changing the sacral outflow from parasympathetic to sympathetic, the divisions of the two systems are fairly straightforward; the sympathetic system encompasses those peripheral nerves that synapse along the thoracolumbar region of the spine (roughly vertebrae T1-L3) whereas the parasympathetic system covers peripheral nerve synapses in the vertebrae regions of T12-S4 in addition to a number of cranial nerves. As can be noticed from this description, there is a slight overlap of these divisions in the lowest region of the thoracic spine as well as throughout the lumbar spine region. This overlap is a result of some directly opposing functions of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems in regulating the stomach region. The relationship is further detailed in the diagrams below. File:1501 Connections of the Sympathetic Nervous System.jpgInnvervations of the sympathetic nervous system File:1503 Connections of the Parasympathetic Nervous System.jpgInnervations of the parasympathetic nervous system = Enteric division = This section is a place holder for information on classification of the enteric nervous system's nerves. This section may be removed altogether, as there is evidence to indicate the enteric nervous system is independent from the autonomic nervous system. = Classification implications = The division of the autonomic nervous system into sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways is particularly useful from a medical treatment perspective [source]. J√§nig et al. warn that changing the classifications of the systems could result in confusion on how to treat some disease, particularly those of the gut and stomach region.

The pact effectively ended Greece's diplomatic isolation within the Balkan peninsula, strengthening its position on the negotiating table with Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Turkey. Romania on the other hand gained a regional ally against its Slavic neighbors. Background Greco‚ÄìRomanian relations can be traced back hundreds of years when the two formed a bastion of the Greco-Roman world in Balkans. They were to continue into the 14th century when the Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia became a refuge for Greeks fleeing from the rapidly declining Byzantine Empire. During the period of Ottoman domination Greek Phanariotes played an important role in the political and cultural life of modern-day Romania. Their influence being one of the reason that the Greek War of Independence was launched in the Danubian Principalities instead of Greece itself. Negotiations between the United Principalities and the now independent Greek state during the period of 1866‚Äì1869 proved fruitless. Romanian hopes of achieving independence through dialog in conjunction with the birth of Romanian national historiography which sharply criticized the Phanariotes being the main obstacles. Events surrounding the Great Eastern Crisis such as the foundation of the Bulgarian Exarchate and the threat of Pan-Slavism reversed the situation. The Treaty of Berlin (1878) marked not only the creation of an independent Romania but also the restoration of amiable diplomatic relations between the two states. Having abandoned all claims to Transylvania and Bukovina Romania turned its attention to the Bulgarian held Southern Dobruja. Since the area's Romanian population was sparse, Romania sought to instill nationalist ideals in the Aromanians populating Ottoman-ruled Macedonia. The Aromanians were then to settle in South Dobruja thus reinforcing Romanian claims to the region. Organizations such as the Society of Macedono‚ÄìRomanian Culture funded ethnographic expeditions to Macedonia, Epirus and Thessaly, funding was allocated to the creation of Romanian speaking schools and churches. This coincided with the wider Macedonian Struggle conflict where similar organizations of Greek, Bulgarian and Serbian origin not only propagated their culture but also engaged in armed struggle against each other and the Ottoman authorities. Romanian influence in Macedonia remained limited as its schools lacked the necessary funding, moreover the Aromanians struggled to adapt to the Romanian language as taught in the schools. In 1896 Ottoman authorities refused to appoint a Romanian metropolitan bishop to the Aromanian communities. Romanian authorities bribed Ottoman officials with 100,000 gold francs, however when the Ottoman sultan demanded a formal alliance the Romanians broke off negotiations. Another important issue was the status of the inheritances of Greeks in Romania. In 1892, Romania refused to hand over the property of the recently deceased Greek expatriate Konstantinos Zappas to the Greek state, citing an article of the Romanian constitution forbidding foreign nationals from owning agricultural land. The then Greek government under Charilaos Trikoupisn recalled its ambassador in Bucharest and Romania followed suit, thus severing diplomatic relations between the two countries. Diplomatic relations were restored in July 1896, in response to a rise of Bulgarian komitadji activity in Macedonia. The assassination of Romanian professor »òtefan MihƒÉileanu by a komitadji agent on 22 July 1900, caused panic in Bucharest amidst fears of an impending war with Bulgaria. On 24 April 1904, a group of pro‚ÄìRomanian Aromanians submitted a petition to the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople demanding greater autonomy, including the administration of church service in the Aromanian language instead of Greek. The Patriarchate viewed the incident as a Romanian provocation, citing the fact that the translations of religious texts were not officially approved it declined the petition. In 1905, the two countries exchanged accusations regarding the Vlach Question. Romania claimed that Greek armed bands targeted ethnic Romanians in Macedonia, whereas Greece accused Romania of trying to create a false equation between Aromanians and Romanians. Hellenophobic articles began appearing in the Romanian press. On 2 August 1905, the Society of Macedono‚ÄìRomanian Culture organized an anti‚ÄìGreek protest in Bucharest, attended by army officers, students and Vlachs. After decrying Greek war crimes in Macedonia, the organizers called for a boycott of Greek products and services. Rioting was prevented by a large force of Romanian gendarmerie. On the same day a Greek-owned cafe in Bucharest was vandalized and its owner beaten. Several days later three editors of the Greek-language newspaper Patris were expelled from the country for sedition. On 13 August, protesters burnt a Greek flag in Giurgiu. An official remonstrance by the Greek ambassador Tombazis was rebutted, leading to a mutual withdrawal of embassies on 15 September. In November, the Romanian government allocated funding for the creation of armed Aromanian bands in Macedonia, and in a parallel move closed numerous Greek schools in the country. In February 1906, six leading members of the Greek community were expelled from the country, citing their alleged funding of Greek bands in Macedonia. In July 1906, the Greek government officially cut diplomatic relations with Romania. In 1911, Greek prime minister Eleftherios Venizelos used the occasion of the Italo-Turkish War to improve relations with Bulgaria and Romania, restoring diplomatic relations with the latter. The Balkan League, which included Bulgaria and Greece, defeated the Ottomans in the First Balkan War. The League broke at the conclusion of the war, with the former participants and Romania soundly defeating Bulgaria in the Second Balkan War. At the Treaty of Bucharest (1913), Romania supported Greek claims to Kavala, whereas Venizelos granted concessions to the Aromanians. The Vlach Question which had already lost steam due to Romanian gains in north Bulgaria came to a conclusion. The Greco‚ÄìRomanian alliance was further solidified during World War I when both countries sided with the Triple Entente. In the aftermath of the Greco-Turkish War (1919‚Äì1922), Greece found itself to be in the midst of an internal political crisis. The situation exacerbated by the emergence of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in the north, Italian imperial ambitions in the eastern Mediterranean Sea and the resurgence of Turkey as a regional power. The 1923 Corfu incident showcased the inability of the League of Nations to protect the interests of smaller countries such as Greece from the encroachments of Italy. In 1924, Yugoslavia unilaterally cancelled the Greek‚ÄìSerbian Alliance of 1913. In the meantime irrevocable differences with Bulgaria prevented the two countries from normalizing relations. Romanian diplomats Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu and Nicolae Titulescu perceived the fact that Romania was surrounded by Slavic countries as a threat to its security. Thessaloniki's appeal as a potential artery for Romanian exports further increased the possibility of a Greco‚ÄìRomanian alliance. In 1927, Alexandru Averescu and Andreas Michalakopoulos engaged in discussions regarding the conclusion of a non- aggression pact. Michalakopoulos agreed to the establishment of a railway line between the two countries, given that it would not be utilized for military purposes. That meant that Romania was to engage in a military confrontation against Bulgaria, shall the latter use the railway to deploy its military against Greece. Negotiations were temporarily halted as Romanian diplomats pondered on how to preserve a balance between their involvement with the French-led Little Entente and Italy which supported Romanian claims in Bessarabia. In January 1928, Titulescu secured Benito Mussolini's approval for a Greco‚ÄìRomanian treaty. Treaty Negotiations with Greece resumed in March 1928, during a regular League of Nations conference in Geneva. The Greek‚ÄìRomanian Non-Aggression and Arbitration Pact was signed by Michalakopoulos and Titulescu on 21 March. The two sides agreed to abstain from engaging each other in military confrontations, instead resolving their differences through diplomatic channels, according to the rules previously laid out by the League of Nations. Aftermath The pact effectively ended Greece's diplomatic isolation within the Balkan peninsula, strengthening its position on the negotiating table with Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Turkey. Venizelos' rejection of the Little Entente as a central European alliance alien to Greece paved the way for the Greco‚ÄìItalian Treaty of 1928, which in turn led to diplomatic agreements with Yugoslavia and Turkey in 1929 and 1930 respectively. In 1931, Venizelos visits Bucharest to conclude the Greek‚ÄìRomanian Trade and Shipping Agreement with his counterpart Nicolae Iorga.

Completed in 1935, the tower is part of Rockefeller Center, and was built in the Art Deco style. The International Building is set back from Fifth Avenue, with a plaza in front of the main entrance. Two retail wings, the Palazzo d'Italia and International Building North, surround the plaza to the south and north, respectively. The building contains several works of art as part of its design, including the Atlas statue in the plaza. History =Construction= The International Building and its wings were built as part of the construction of the Rockefeller Center, and an oval-shaped retail building was originally planned for the adjacent block to the south, between 49th and 50th Streets. The oval building was scrapped in early 1931, and an updated plan proposed a tall 41-story tower and two smaller 6-story retail buildings on the site of the oval building. As American tenants were reluctant to rent in these retail buildings, Rockefeller Center's manager Hugh Robertson, formerly of Todd, Robertson and Todd, suggested foreign tenants for the buildings. Because the canceled oval building had contained rooftop gardens, Raymond Hood suggested the idea for rooftop gardens across the complex, including on all of the retail buildings. These gardens would be curated by Ralph Hancock. Two themed buildings on the adjacent block, the British Empire Building and La Maison Francaise, were respectively leased by Britain and France. A department store and 30-story building (later changed to 45 stories) was planned for the site of the current International Building, between 50th and 51st Streets, with the department store portion facing Fifth Avenue. The International Building plan was modified to its current status in June 1932, when plans for the department store were replaced with two proposed retail wings, which would be nearly identical to the twin retail buildings to their south. The two new retail buildings, connected to each other and to the main tower with a galleria, were proposed to serve Italian and possibly also German interests upon completion. In May 1934, plans were officially filed for the remaining two International-themed buildings, as well as a larger 38-story, \\"International Building\\" at 45 Rockefeller Center. Work on the buildings started in September 1934. The final small building would have been rented by Germany under the name \\"Deutsches Haus\\", but Rockefeller ruled this out in 1934 after being advised of Adolf Hitler's Nazi march toward World War II. Russia had also entered into negotiations to lease the final building in 1934, but by 1935, the building's occupancy was unclear as the Russians were no longer actively seeking a lease. With no definite tenant for the northernmost building, the Rockefeller Center's managers reduced the proposed nine-story buildings to six stories, enlarged and realigned the main building from a north-south to a west-east axis, and replaced the proposed galleria between the two retail buildings with an expansion of the International Building's lobby. The empty office site thus became \\"International Building North\\", rented by various international tenants. = Opening and later years = In April 1935, developers opened the building. A record 136 days had elapsed from groundbreaking to completion. The internationally-themed complex was seen as a symbol of solidarity during the interwar period, when Italy's entry in the League of Nations was obstructed by American isolationists. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission added landmark status to the exteriors of all the original Rockefeller Center's buildings in 1985. The first-floor interior of the International Building was also designated at the same time. In its approval of the complex's status, the commission wrote, \\"Rockefeller Center ranks among the grandest architectural projects ever undertaken in the United States\\". The roof gardens of the wings were restored in 1986 for $48,000 each. The complex became a National Historic Landmark in 1987. Description Palazzo d'Italia The International Building has the address 630 Fifth Avenue to its east, or 45 Rockefeller Plaza to its west. The tower stands at 41 stories high, including mechanical floors. It was recessed as far back from Fifth Avenue as possible so as to maximize rental space while still complying with the 1916 Zoning Resolution, which mandated that buildings of a certain height needed architectural recessions depending on how far the building's wall was from the street. One of two skyscrapers that opened in Manhattan in 1935, it was noted for its short 136-day duration of construction, as well as the construction quality, overall design, and materials used. The building, located in the middle of the block between Rockefeller Plaza and Fifth Avenue, contains a central plaza on its east, facing the Fifth Avenue entrance. The Fifth Avenue entrance leads to the four- story-high lobby. There are three glass-and-nickel bronze revolving doors underneath a sign that spells \\"FIFTH AVENUE\\" in nickel bronze capital letters. Three-story-high windows, surrounded by marble, are located above the doors. These windows can be used to hold exhibitions. The International Building's lobby was inspired by the triangular-shaped lobby of the Chrysler Building and the chapel-like lobby of the Empire State Building. As the International Building was not as big as 30 Rockefeller Plaza, the tower's architects designed the lobby so that it created an illusion of grandeur. The lobby is bedecked with \\"rich, elegant materials\\", including veined green marble stretching the entire height of the wall; nickel bronze moldings at the top of the green marble columns, and copper leaf on the ceiling. Elevators ascend to an upper mezzanine and descend to the complex's underground mall, highlighting movement. These escalators also have nickel bronze gilding. Three-story-high hallways stretch to the north and south of the lobby, leading to Palazzo d'Italia and International Building North. The mezzanine also has green marble walls, as well as corridors to the north and south leading to the annexes. The passenger elevators are placed in a central core, ringed by a rectangular corridor on each floor. The ground level has a similar footprint to the office levels above it, except that the ground level contains stores instead of office space. The lobby contains large windows that were originally intended for exhibitions, but no showrooms were ever installed. Marble piers, topped with nickel bronze moldings, surround the green-marble walls of the elevator bank. Offices surround the corridors on each of the levels above the mezzanine. The complex's original architect, Raymond Hood, ensured that all of the offices in the entire complex be a maximum of from a window since that was the maximum distance that sunlight could permeate the windows of a building at New York City's latitude. Palazzo d'Italia and International Building North serve as wings of the International Building. Their one-story side entrances complement the grand shaft and entrance of the main tower. =Palazzo d'Italia= The more southerly of the two wings is Palazzo d'Italia (literally the Italian Palace) at 626 Fifth Avenue. The limestone-clad building contains retail space on the first floor, separated from the offices above it by an exterior cornice, as well as setbacks on the sixth floor. It is attached to the International Building at its northwest corner. The Italian leader Benito Mussolini was impressed by the building's original 9-story height, which beat the 6-story height of the French and British Buildings, although the two new wings were later scaled down to six stories as well. =International Building North= The International Building North, at 636 Fifth Avenue, is the identical twin of Palazzo d'Italia and the more northerly of the main building's two wings, being attached to the main building at its southwest corner. The International Building North, like its twin, contains a rooftop garden, a first-floor cornice, and a sixth-floor setback. The building also contains a themed rooftop garden on the eastern half of the roof. Art Lee Lawrie's , bronze Atlas statue stands in the center of the building's central plaza. Behind the Atlas statue is the tower's entrance, which consists of four doors under another of Lawrie's works: a limestone screen depicting the history of international relations. Artwork in the lobby includes Michio Ihara's \\"metallic structures\\", installed in 1978, and Paul Fjelde's \\"bronze bust of Charles Lindbergh\\", installed in 1975. The side entrances on 50th and 51st Streets also contain limestone reliefs created by Lawrie. The reliefs above the 50th Street entrance depict international cooperation, while the relief on the 51st Street entrance contains fourteen fictional shields of heraldry. A back entrance contains two limestone reliefs by Gaston Lachaise, which honor the workers who built the complex. This back entrance was later modified to reflect Isamu Noguchi's design of the Associated Press Building entrance, located directly behind the International Building. Both wings originally included artworks by Attilio Piccirilli above their entrances; Palazzo d'Italia's artwork was installed first, in July 1935, followed by the International Building North's in April 1936. Piccirilli's Palazzo work was removed in 1941 because the panels were seen as an overt celebration of fascism, but his International Building North work was allowed to stay. Leo Lentelli also created works for the two buildings; his work on the Italian building was also modified, but not the work on International Building North. In 1965, the original Piccirilli work above the entrance was replaced by Italia, Giacomo Manz√π's bronze relief depicting fruits. Manz√π also created The Immigrant, a depiction of a penurious mother and child, located below Italia. Unlike the other retail buildings' three-glass-door entrances, the palazzo only contains two bronze doors at its entrance. The entrance cartouche originally depicted the Crown of Savoy and a Fascist symbol, but these too were removed in 1941, never to be replaced. Also modified during the war were Leo Lentelli's limestone bas-reliefs on the cornice, which depicted four periods of Italian history. Lee Lawrie's work were the only original artworks on the Palazzo dItalia's exterior that were not modified during the war. Lawrie had created Saint Francis of Assisi with Birds, a bas-relief atop the 50th Street entrance, which depicts Francis of Assisi with a halo of golden birds around his head. Because it was not originally built for a specific country, the International Building North contains generic works related to international cooperation. Lentelli created four bas-reliefs above the sixth story windows, signifying Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas. Piccirilli's cartouche above the entrance, signifying a male and female holding tools and separated by the god Mercury, was intended with a similar theme, but instead ended up having a slightly fascist effect. Piccirilli also designed the opaque \\"Poetic Glass\\" screen above the entrance, symbolizing a youth's involvement in world affairs. Lawrie designed a bas-relief for the 51st Street entrance, with a woman and horn being an allegory for world cooperation.

Along with Breezer, RIO is one of the largest alcopop producers in China where both the brands share a combined two-thirds of the alcopop market in China. RIO generated revenue of 365 million yuan (US$59 million) in the first half of 2014. In 2016, Bacchus reached a partnership with Veolia Water Technologies China.  Background and naming  The founder of RIO was present at a wine tasting event in Singapore. However in the 90's, most alcohol brands used only single wine-based ingredients. He was puzzled by the few types of juices that could form a good taste with alcohol. He then studied chuhai cocktails in Japan to suit the tastebuds of Asians before launching the product in 2003. Unlike its Japanese counterparts, RIO was sold in glass bottles instead of aluminium cans as the founder believed that cocktails are better received by consumers when packaged in glass. The brand was given the name RIO to evoke the tropical feel of Brazil's Rio de Janeiro.  Marketing  RIO is title sponsor for multiple Chinese dramas, movies and variety shows. RIO's products are endorsed in the shows, which include drama Boss & Me, Love O2O, top variety show Keep Running and many more. Yang Yang and Amber Kuo are currently the spokespersons for RIO, succeeding Zhou Xun.  Lawsuit  In 2017, Bacchus filed an action with the Beijing Dongcheng District People‚Äôs Court against Tonghua Dongte Wine Co., Ltd. for unfair competition in which the former claims of Dongte‚Äôs \\"BIO\\" series has infringed its \\"RIO\\" series's appearance and packaging. The court hearing rendered Bacchus with compensations of RMB 3 million in damages.

She was a co-facilitator, with Jacinthe Veillette, and spokesperson of the Qu√©bec Charter for a Healthy and Diverse Body Image. Clermont-Dion came to public attention during an appearance on the television programme Tout le monde en parle in October 2009. She is a doctoral student in political science at Laval University and the author of La revanche des moches (2014) and Les Superbes (2016). Biography After experiencing a health problem related to anorexia nervosa at age 12, L√©a Clermont-Dion questioned the pressure put on women by the unachievable media ideal of thin models. In 2006, at age 14, she worked with Cathy Wong to organize a conference of leading feminists at the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al (UQAM) which attracted more than 400 people. The same year she was recruited by the youth committee of the on which she served from 2006 to 2008. Clermont-Dion met Jacinthe Veillette, who had a similar body image struggle; together, they wrote a petition that was posted online. The petition was tabled in the National Assembly of Quebec and resulted in a bill: Charte qu√©b√©coise pour une image corporelle saine et diversifi√©e (Quebec Charter for a Healthy and Diverse Body Image). It was drawn up by a working committee of about thirty people from the fashion, advertising, media, video, music and government sectors. A unique charter in North America, it was officially released in the fall of 2009. The next spring, an awareness campaign was launched at schools and colleges and on television, radio and the Internet. As a spokesperson for the charter, Clermont-Dion speaks several times a year at schools. Clermont-Dion was named 2011 Personnalit√© par Excellence by Forces Avenir, who awarded her a scholarship to aid her undergraduate studies in political science at UQAM. She spent a year at Sciences Po in Paris, earned a bachelor's degree in political science then in 2014 began a master's degree in political science and feminist studies at Laval University. Clermont-Dion has stated that the new generation of feminism is more individualistic than the movement of the past, and that she has a social democratic vision, that \\"the feminist struggle is part of a whole, an ideal of society.\\" Not wanting to be associated with a single cause, she has been involved with famine relief, education and environmental movements, and took part in an Oxfam‚Äì internship in Burkina Faso. Clermont-Dion has also tried to create dialog by bringing issues forward creatively, as in her short film Sandra about teenaged prostitution and the photo exhibit \\"Banfora en 30 visages\\" which showed empowering portraits of the Green Brigades. Her first book, La revanche des moches (), published in 2014, examines the collective obsession with appearance and beauty and brought confirming testimonial from music artist Mitsou. The two joined as co-hosts of feminist documentary series Mitsou et L√©a. In 2017 she began working on her first feature-length documentary, Mysogynie 2.0, about sexual harassment on the Internet. =Sexual assault allegation= On 25 October 2017 Clermont-Dion claimed on her Facebook page to have filed a sexual assault complaint against Michel Venne, journalist and founder of the Institut du Nouveau Monde, for an alleged incident that occurred when he was her boss in the summer of 2008. She was a minor at the time. During 2014‚Äì2015 she made a public release about the alleged incident without naming her attacker. Clermont-Dion claimed that Lise Payette, a feminist and columnist, pressured her to sign a retraction as rumours spread, affecting Venne's opportunity to become an editor at Le Devoir. Clermont-Dion claimed to have taken action in 2017 in support of the #MoiAussi movement. Venne denied the allegations on his Facebook page, and suspended his professional activities pending an investigation.

In 2009 she won the title of world champion in sled-dog racing in the 4-dog and 6-dog categories. In 2013 she won the world championship in 8-dog racing. Biography Kati Dagenais is a practicing acupuncturist who accompanied her husband, Martin Dagenais, to sled-dog races. When he was injured in 2008, she stepped in to train the dogs and quickly made a name for herself. She won three of four races in her first year of competitive racing and the following year became world champion. Dagenais, who was barely five feet tall and less than 100 pounds, began intensive bodybuilding for the strength to control an 8-dog team.

Dagensais won the 8-dog race at the 2012 Gosford Challenge, setting a new track record of 43 minutes 58.49 seconds. Second and third-place finished 3 and 4 minutes behind her. She followed this with a gold medal win at the 2012 Limited North American Championship in Alaska. Due to the logistics of air transporting a dog team, Dagenais entered the 6-dog event at the 2015 World Championships in Todtmoos, Germany. Despite further reducing her team to 5 dogs after her head dog was injured, she finished with the bronze medal. Dagenais won the six-dog event at the 2017 Mauricie Challenge. She noted that there were more female competitors and champions, and suggested that a maternal instinct was appreciated by the dogs. At the 2017 World Cup in Haliburton, Ontario, Dangenais was left alone on the track when her 8-dog team took off when she stepped off the sled to fix a problem. Competitor Lars Lindh stopped and brought her on his sled for until they caught her team. Dagenais expressed how grateful and impressed she was for Lindh's sportsmanship in putting her safety before precious seconds in the hunt for World Cup gold. Lindh ultimately won gold in the event.

In the late 2000s the magazine was affected by the Great Recession, but they were also struggling to compete in the market‚Äîpartially owing to the proliferation of localised editions of international magazines. It ceased publication in March 2010 due to a decrease in both sales and advertising revenue. The April 2010 issue was the final one. Femina was originally published by Republican Press in Durban. Associated Magazines in Cape Town acquired Femina in the late 1980s, and published their first issue in April 1988. The magazine was later published by Raphaely Kuhnel Publishing (also of Cape Town), which sold it in 2006 to Media24 (part of the media conglomerate Naspers). At the time of Feminas closure, Media24 was the predominant publisher of consumer magazines in South Africa. Its other women's magazines included Fair Lady, Sarie, and True Love. As of 1992, editor-in-chief Jane Raphaely was also chief editor of the South African edition of Cosmopolitan.

She is most remembered for her career in the cinema, with some 20 films to her credit. Her first major film role was that of a disillusioned wife in Denys Arcand's La Maudite Galette (1972) followed by R√©jeanne Padovani (1973). She played in O.K. ...

In less than twenty years, from 1882 to 1900, Roanoke had grown from 669 citizens to 21,000. In 1907 the WCBC held a \\"Great Fall Festival\\" in order to raise money to hire a city planner. They were able to raise enough money to hire John Nolen. At the festival, they were able to raise the equivalent of $125,000 (they raised $5,000.00, or about $125,000.00 in 2017 dollars).

Yet, within only a few years the citizens of Roanoke as seen marked improvement in the acquisition of land for public parks; school facilities; better city sanitation; abatement of dust and dirt nuisances on the streets. While they were unable to directly influence the city council, they were able to press for the first public library in Roanoke, and the purchase of parks, playgrounds, and pressed for a juvenile court. As a writer in 1912 said, \\"Their cooperation in work for Roanoke's uplift and welfare has been of signal service to the community, and the part they have taken in the general scheme of development work is worthy of the highest praise.\\" Jack, George S., and Edward Boyle Jacobs.

After winning her only race as a juvenile she ran up four consecutive wins in the following season including the Sandringham Handicap and the Atalanta Stakes before her winning streak was ended by Alice Springs in the Matron Stakes. In 2017 she was placed in both the Matron Stakes and the Sun Chariot Stakes before recording her most significant victory when she became the first horse of her age and sex in more than 40 years to take the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. Background Persuasive is a grey mare bred in County Kildare, Ireland by John Tuthill. As a yearling in September 2014 she was put up for sale at Goffs and was bought for ‚Ç¨180,000 by the Cheveley Park Stud. She was then sent to England and entered training with John Gosden at Newmarket, Suffolk. She was ridden in all but two of her races by Frankie Dettori. Her sire Dark Angel won four races including the Mill Reef Stakes and the Middle Park Stakes as a two-year-old in 2007 before being retired to stud at the end of the year. Dark Angel's other offspring have included Lethal Force, Mecca's Angel and Harry Angel. Persuasive's dam Choose Me was a durable racemare who won four of her 28 tart including a valuable sales race at the Curragh and the Listed Fairy Bridge Stakes at Tipperary Racecourse. As a broodmare she has also produced the Coral Distaff winner Tisbutadream and the successful sprint handicapper Amazour. Choose Me was a great-granddaughter of the outstanding Irish racemare Cairn Rouge. Racing career =2015: two- year-old season= Persuasive made her debut in a maiden race over one mile on the synthetic polytrack surface at Kempton Park on 4 November and started a 16/1 outsider. Ridden by Jimmy Fortune, she took the lead two furlongs out and held on to win by a neck from the favourite Secret Sense. =2016: three-year- old season= Persuasive began her second season in handicap races, starting with a minor event over one mile at Goodwood Racecourse on 20 May in which she was assigned a weight of 133 pounds. Starting the 10/11 favourite, she took the lead inside the final furlong and won by one and a half lengths despite being eased down by Dettori near the finish. Twelve days later she followed up in a more valuable event on the synthetic track at Chelmsford City Racecourse winning \\"comfortably\\" from eight opponents. At Royal Ascot Persuasive, carrying 121 pounds, started 11/4 favourite for the Listed Sandringham Handicap on 15 June, with the best-fancied of her 20 opponents being the Owenstown Stud Stakes winner Anamba and the Queen's filly Diploma. Racing on soft ground, Persuasive went to the front approaching the final furlong and stayed on strongly to win by one and quarter lengths from Diamond Fields. Gosden described the winner as \\"a lovely filly\\" while Dettori said \\"She is improving. On good ground I would have waited a bit longer and used her explosive turn of foot. She can try something bigger now.\\" On 20 August Persuasive was stepped up in class and started 6/4 favourite for the Group 3 Atalanta Stakes at Sandown Park. Her eleven opponents included Blond Me (Coral Distaff), Spirit Raiser (Pipalong Stakes) and Red Box (Valiant Stakes). Ridden by Robert Havlin she ettled in mid-division before taking the lead a furlong out and winning in \\"impressive\\" style by three lengths from Blond Me. John Gosden commented \\"she did it very nicely. She's a talented, progressive filly\\". The filly was undefeated in five races when she was sent to Ireland and moved up to Group 1 class for the Matron Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse on 10 September. She briefly took the lead in the straight but was overtaken inside the final furlong and beaten into second place by Alice Springs. Qemah finished third while Jet Setting came home in sixth place. =2017: four-year- old season= After an absence of over ten months, Persuaive returned in the Group 1 Prix Rothschild over 1600 metres at Deauville Racecourse on 30 July 2017 and finished fifth of the ten runners behind Roly Poly, Via Ravenna, Siyoushake and Qemah. On 9 September at Leopardstown she ran for the second time in the Matron Stakes and came home strongly to take third place behind Hydrangea and Winter with Wuheida, Qemah, Roly Poly and Rhododendron finishing behind. At Newmarket Racecourse on 7 October the filly started favourite for the Group 1 Sun Chariot Stakes but was beaten into second place by Roly Poly. Two weeks after her defeat in the Sun Chariot Stakes, Persuasive was matched against male opposition for the first time in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes on soft ground at Ascot. Ribchester started favourite ahead of Churchill, Beat the Bank (Joel Stakes) and Al Wukair (Prix Jacques Le Marois) with Persuasive next in the betting at 8/1. The other ten runners included Thunder Snow, Here Comes When (Sussex Stakes), Lightning Spear (Celebration Mile), Breton Rock (Lennox Stakes) and Lancaster Bomber. Dettori positioned the filly towards the rear of the field before witching her to the outside to make a challenge in the straight. She took the lead a furlong from the finish and won by a length from Ribchester, with Churchill half a length away in third, becoming the first four-year-old filly to take the race since Rose Bowl in 1976. Following the filly's win Gosden said \\"It never worries me taking the colts on late in the year with a filly. I think they go through hell through the spring into the summer, coming into season and out of season, and hormonally they are a bit like a boy growing up. Then when they come to late summer and autumn everything is settled and they can focus on racing... She's a very good filly and I'm thrilled with her. We've waited for this ground as she loves it.

At the beginning of his career he did research on number theory, but he soon began to specialize in rational mechanics. His research dealt with the classification of the types of holonomic systems and the three-body problem. Bisconcini was one of the professors conducting the Universit√† clandestina di Roma (1941‚Äì1943), which was organized by Guido Castelnuovo to teach secret university courses to Jews and disfavored opponents of fascism.

Design and development The SkyCruiser features a single main rotor, a two- seats-in tandem open cockpit with a windshield, tricycle landing gear with wheel pants, plus a tail caster and a four-cylinder, liquid and air-cooled, four stroke Rotax 914 turbocharged engine or modified turbocharged Rotax 912 in pusher configuration. The aircraft fuselage is made from composites and has a two-bladed rotor with a diameter of and an electronic pre-rotator. The aircraft has a gross weight of . The design features an automatic propeller system. When the electronic pre-rotator for the main rotor is engaged the pusher propeller automatically goes to flat pitch and creates no thrust. When the pilot moved the control stick aft to take-off the propeller automatically goes to best climb setting. In 2011 an improved version was introduced called the SC-200 \\"New Face\\", with aesthetic changes, including a more rounded cockpit fairing and wider cockpit seating.

She was first elected to the Senate in the 1992 elections, and was re-elected in 1994 and 1996. After serving in the Budget Committee her first two terms, she served as the Undersecretary for the Ministry of Public Education from 1999 to 2000, and served as State Secretary for the Ministry of Health from 2000 until the end of her term in 2001. In 2001, Rocchi ran for and won a seat in the Chamber of Deputies, and served there until 2006. In late 2001, when Italy was voting on involving themselves in the War on Afghanistan, Rocchi voted in favor of intervention, but did so with a Burqa in her hands to show solidarity with the women of Afghanistan. She did not run for re-election in 2006, and instead became president of Ente Nazionale Protezione Animali, Italy's Animal Protection Agency. In 2017, she became a member of the Animalist Movement, established as an animal rights party, splitting from the Greens as she felt they had gone too far left in their policies, but also due to them not having animal rights as a strong part of their platform.

Contents Castle Book I presents fifty castles of varying shapes and sizes. Publication history Judges Guild began their publication of original material with a subscription format, but by 1978 the line between subscription and non-subscriptions items would grow increasingly vague. However their Castle Book I (1978), which had 50 castle maps, could not be found among the subscription packets at all. From there on, the subscription installments represented only some of the Judges Guild books for those months. A listing of cumulative sales from 1981 shows that Castle Book I sold over 15,000 units. Different Worlds Publications later acquired and distributed game products formerly produced by Judges Guild, including Village Book 1, Village Book 2, Castle Book I, and Castle Book II. Reception In the May 1981 edition of The Space Gamer (No. 39), Kurt Butterfield commented that \\"The Castle Book has many interesting ideas in it. For the price, it's a bargain.\\" In the May 1988 edition of Dragon (Issue #133), Ken Rolston said, \\"There are no details for the functions or contents of the individual buildings, but it‚Äôs nice to have the layouts when whipping up an adventure setting on short notice.\\" References Judges Guild fantasy role-playing game supplements ","title":"Castle Book I"},{"id":"55870651","text":"David Johansson (born 1935) is a Finnish diplomat and ambassador.
