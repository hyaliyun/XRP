MCB operates 23 branches and specializes in insurance brokerage, consumer banking, trust, private banking and corporate management services.  History  Beginning in 1893, the absence of coins and banknotes in Cura√ßao led S.E.L. Maduro & Sons to issue money coupons up until the introduction of the 1901 Coinage Act. For a long time this 'Maduro Money' was accepted as payment on the ABC islands. However, by the early 20th century increasing industrialization following the discovery of oil in nearby Venezuela and the opening of the Panama Canal ushered in a demand for modern banking services. On December 16, 1916, after a failed bid to take over the Central Bank of Cura√ßao, local financier Joseph Alvarez-Correa with the financial backing of S.E.L. Maduro & Sons established Maduro's Bank, the island's first commercial bank. In 1932, Curiel's Bank, founded by members of the Curiel family and which had grown from the successful banking department of Morris E. Curiel & Sons, merged with Maduro's Bank to form MCB. The bank is considered the first to have extended credit to Eastern European Jews fleeing persecution in the years preceding World War II. Since 1970, MCB has been affiliated with Scotiabank.

He was the 1974 winner of the Prix des Deux Magots.Les Deux Magots (website), List of Award Winners Biography Hardellet was born at Vincennes. He began to study medicine, but dropped his studies to assume the leadership of his family's business, Les Alliances Nuptia, a jewelry- fabrication shop in Marais. He later developed into a wide-ranging author, publishing poems, short stories, essays, song lyrics, novels and stories. He published Lourdes, Lentes (1969) using the pseudonym St√®ve Masson. The erotic nature of that work is rumored to have shocked Raymond Marcellin, the Minister of the Interior. In 1973 Hardellet was condemned by the 17e chambre correctionnelle de Paris, for \\"outrages against good morals\\". Hardellet was greatly affected by this pronouncement, and died the following year. The year of Hardellet's death was somewhat ironically crowned as his literary pinnacle, when he was awarded (posthumously) the 1974 Prix des Deux Magots for his collected poems, Les Chasseurs deux (The Two Hunters). In 1975 a collection of Hardellet's poems, Po√®tes d'aujourd'hui (Today's Poets), edited by Hubert Juin, was issued. In 1990 Guy Darol published an essay, Andr√© Hardellet ou le Don de double vie (Andre Hardellet, or the Don of the Double Life). The essay was re-issued in 1998.

Between 1925 and 1942 Mercier designed more than 120 cinema posters and also produced numerous commercial posters. Notably, he designed for the house of Cointreau because of connections through his mother, the granddaughter of the founder of the company and daughter of the creator of triple sec Cointreau. Mercier worked there for some forty years, eventually becoming the artistic director of the firm. At the end of the 1930s, Mercier began producing illustrations for children's books and fairy tales. His entrance into children's illustrations was aided from his creation of the \\"Salut Olympique\\" for the Vichy government in 1940.

A Huguenot moderate lawyer and parliamentarian, he was exiled to Geneva after the massacre of St. Bartholomew, and then returned to France after the Edict of Beaulieu in 1576. His Protestant views are the cause of a new exile to Geneva in 1585, where he died in 1588. He wrote and published in 1576 the Discours sur les moyens de bien gouverner (Sermon on the means of governing), in which he condemned the ideas of Niccolo Machiavelli, suspected of trying to introduce impiety and immorality in government. He also accused the Italians of the entourage of Catherine de' Medici to make the propagators. The book, translated and published in Latin in 1577, then in English, has considerable diffusion throughout Europe until the mid-seventeenth century. It was known as the Anti-Machiavel and was the first source of the concept machiavellism. Gentillet argues that the source of wealth of a state is its large population. He believes that the infighting and bad laws are contrary to the development of population and condemned luxury as detrimental to national welfare.

His work is considered crucial for the development of photography in Greece, and its use in favourably publicising the country's expansionist ambitions, during the early 20th century. Boissonnas constitutes a central figure in the transition from 19th century approaches to a more contemporary photography of antiquities. Biography Boissonnas's father, Henri-Antoine (1833‚Äì1889), founded a photographic studio in Geneva in 1864 and took over Auguste Garcin's studio in place Bel-Air in 1865. In 1872, he settled with his family in a building at number 4 quai de la Poste. Fr√©d√©ric ran the family studio from 1887 to 1920. He had at least seven children, including Edmond-Edouard (1891‚Äì1924), Henri- Paul (1894‚Äì1966) and Paul (1902‚Äì1983). In 1901, he went into partnership with to create a studio in Paris, at number 12 rue de la Paix.  Greece  Fr√©d√©ric Boissonnas (1919) Title page of L'Image de la Gr√®ce Between 1903 and 1933 Boissonnas made several trips to Greece where he systematically documented Greece in landscape photographs, taken in all corners of the country reflect its continuity from ancient times to the present day. He travelled to the Peloponnese, Crete, the islands, Ithaca, Mount Athos, etc. On one Greek expedition with compatriot art historian Daniel Baud-Bovy, Boissonnas made the first recorded modern-era ascent of Mount Olympus on 2 August 1913, aided by a hunter of wild goats from Litochoro, Christos Kakkalos. In total, Boissonnas published 14 photo albums dedicated to Greece, many of which belong to the thematic series entitled L'image de la Grece ('The Image of Greece'), his imagery contributing decisively to the identity of Greece in Europe; its promotion as a tourist destination but also its political situation. His photographs of archaeological sites form 20% of his total Greek series. He visited The Acropolis, Delphi, Olympia, Dodoni, Knossos, Delos and many other sites, providing an extensive iconographic panorama of classical Greek antiquities. In 1923 Le Courbusier used Boissonnas' photographs of the Parthenon in his book Vers un architecture. Daniel Baud-Bovy wrote of other ambitions of their collaboration on these publications; > \\"For many years, Greece was considered as one of these dead stars, whose > rays, reach us through the centuries past. One has to blame the > archaeologists, or the art historians. They saw nothing but the ruins ... > our plan was to deal not only with the brilliance of the ancient monuments, > but also to relive the landscapes that surround them, the people, who are > their everyday witnesses.\\" Interested not only in documenting a site, Boissonnas also aimed to interpret the Greek landscape in combining classical antiquity with the provincial Greek folklore through associations of natural and cultural elements carefully composed and in the best ambient light.Girardin, D. (1998). Fr√©d√©ric Boissonnas: Between tradition and modernity. History of Photography, 22(3), 281-283. Incidentally he took five hundred photographs of the automatic dances of a young woman known as 'Magdeleine G' at the Parthenon in antique costume, commissioned to illustrate the hypnotist √âmile Magnin‚Äôs book L‚ÄôArt et l‚ÄôHypnose,√âmile Magnin, L‚ÄôArt et l‚ÄôHypnose.

His last photo-album about Greece published in 1933 was titled 'Following the ship of Ulysses' that sought to reconstruct the epic and, in a symbolic way, the dissemination of Greek culture throughout Europe.Radet, G.

Boissonnas contributed his professional photography, and the services of the family printing firm \\"Boissonnas SA\\" that he founded in 1919, to the expansionist ambitions of the Greek state. He had already secured a small grant for the purpose from King George I in 1907, but gained substantial sponsorship in 1913 for the purpose of photographing and publishing imagery of the newly acquired territories of Epirus and Macedonia. He had an exhibition Visions of Greece in Paris over February‚ÄìMarch 1919 of 550 of his photographs, accompanied by a 260-page illustrated volume (published by the family firm), at which Edouard Chapuisat, editor-in-chief of the Journal de Geneve, announced: \\"Today, all eyes are turned upon Greece, which aspires to regain that place in the East which she occupied so many centuries ago. The support of faithful allies anticipates the hour when Greece, which has given the world the purest jewels of civilisation, will contribute to the reconstruction of Europe on the very borders of the East.\\" In the aftermath of World War I, Greece attempted further expansion into Asia Minor, seeking to take advantage of the dissolution of the former Ottoman Empire where it laid claim to regions that were populated by Greeks, but was defeated in the Greco-Turkish War of 1919‚Äì1922. During the long drawn-out peace negotiations, a new contract was drawn up whereby Frederic and his sons undertook the publication between 1920 and 1926 of a number of illustrated books, volumes with titles Smyrna, Thrace, Constantinople and The Greek Presence in Asia Minor,Wilson, C. (2019). Transnationalistic memories: Fr√©d√©ric Boissonnas‚Äô photographic construction of a Greek-Christian European Thessaloniki in Salonique et ses basiliques (1919). Memory Studies, 12(5), 531-546. the text of which, he reported to the Greek government, \\"quite apart from the high artistic quality of the illustrations - reaffirms in the most categorical way the legitimacy of [Greek] claims over these contested regions.\\" La Campagne d'Epire and its companion, La Campagne de Macedoine published 1920-21 both included his photographs and texts by Fernand Feyler, a retired Swiss colonel and military historian. After the defeat of Venizelos in the elections of November 1920 and the country's increasing diplomatic isolation after the advance into western Asia Minor the Foreign Ministry's Press Bureau worked to ensure positive coverage in the international press. Fr√©d√©ric's son Henri-Paul, with Feyler, were contracted to cover the campaign; Henri-Paul would provide the Greek government with photographs, as well as placing some in the Swiss press, while Feyler undertook to publish articles in the Journal de Geneve and also to publish a book about the campaign and on 'the rights of Hellenism in Asia Minor'. Henri- Paul placed at least 800 photos with the international press, and the Greek ministry paid the newspapers Le Matin, Le Journal, L'√âcho de Paris and Le Petit Parisien 100,000 francs each during the course of 1921, committing the newspapers to \\"refrain from publishing anything which would adversely affect our interests [ ... ] and furthermore, to publish the reports and bulletins with which we will supply them.\\"  Egypt  Boissonnas was invited to Egypt by King Fuad I in 1929 to work on a major book commission and he returned in 1933 to embark on a photographic expedition to Sinai.Baddeley, O. (2011). Fred Boissonnas: The Sinai Expeditions 1929-1933. Following the route of the Israelites as recorded in the Book of Exodus, he photographed the traditional biblical sites that he encountered on his journey. The outcome was the book, √âgypte, which set complex histories as a background to the ‚Äòmodern‚Äô state newly formed in Britain‚Äôs unilateral declaration of Egyptian independence on the 28th February 1922 and Fuad‚Äôs own monarchical role in 1922 and the Egyptian Parliament‚Äôs Constitution of 1923.Sohier, E.

It illustrates how even education cannot change one's basic nature and tells how a priest tries to teach a wolf to read. The fable's journey There is a mere reference to what was already an established fable in the West Asian Story of Ahiqar. Not enough remains of the earlier Aramaic papyrus dating from about 500 BCE, but the story is contained in the next oldest version in Syriac and repeated in still later Arabic, Armenian and Slavonic adaptations. Ahiqar has been betrayed by his nephew Nadan, who asks for a second chance once his behaviour has been exposed. Ahiqar replies with a series of parables indicating that what is bred in the bone will not leave the flesh, including mention of how 'they brought the wolf to the house of the scribe: the master said to him ‚ÄòAleph, Beth‚Äô; the wolf said ‚ÄòKid, Lamb‚Äô.The story of Ahikar, London 1898, p.117 Later versions of the fable make it clear that when the master tries to teach the wolf the Semitic alphabet, of which Aleph and Beth are the first two letters, it replaces them with the similar-sounding names of the animals it likes to eat. The wolf learning its ABC on a capital in the minster of Freiburg in Breisgau, c.1150 If there ever was a Greek equivalent to this fable attributed to Aesop, it has not survived. However, it reappears in Mediaeval Europe as a very popular story, not simply in literary texts but in church architecture. There is a bare mention in a Papal bull of 1096: \\"A wolf was put to learning letters, but when the master said 'A', the wolf answered ‚Äòlamb‚Äô (agnellum)\\", where again the beast's obsession with food is reflected in his choice of an animal beginning with A. Soon after, versions began to appear in fable collections along with many of Aesopic origin. They include the Anglo Latin Romulus, where it is titled De presbyterio et vulpo (The priest and the wolf);Text online the Anglo French Marie de France, which follows this collection in drawing the moral that 'the mouth will betray where the heart is';Katharina M.Wilson, Mediaeval Women Writers, Manchester University 1984, pp.87-8 and the Latin fables of Odo of Cheriton.John C.Jacobs, Syracuse University, 1985, pp.92-3 The story was also incorporated as an episode in Nivardus of Ghent's beast epic, Ysengrimus (V.540-60)Leiden NL 1987, p.447 and a mediaeval German legend collected by Jacob Grimm, \\"Der Wolf in der Schuole\\".Reinhart Fuchs, Berlin 1834, lines 1139-1362 The story was equally popular as an illustration in manuscripts and as a motif in church architecture. A chronological listing of the sculpted images suggests a geographical movement from 12th century Italy northwards to France, Switzerland and Germany.There is a study of these on the University of Minnesota site along with a gallery of images.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Burnley, the archdeaconry of Burnley, and the diocese of Blackburn. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The church was built in 1834‚Äì35 to a design by Lewis Vulliamy, and the chancel was added in 1894 by W. B. Colbram. In 1903‚Äì04 the Lancaster architects Austin and Paley built the west tower and removed old vestries at the west end extending the seating. Financial contributions to all stages of the building were made by the local colliery-owning families of Hargreaves and Thursby. The chapelry district of Saint John, Worsthorne was assigned in 1843. The galleries were removed in 1902, followed by the internal plasterwork in 1929. The interior of the church was partitioned in 1973 to make rooms in two storeys at the west end. Architecture St John's is constructed in sandstone with slate roofs. Its architectural style is Early English. The plan consists of a five-bay nave, a chancel, and a west tower. The tower is in three stages, the upper two stages being set back. At the corners are clasping pilaster-straps, and the plain parapet is further set back. The bottom stage contains an arched west doorway, above which is a pair of lancet windows. Five steps lead up to the doorway, with a wrought iron handrail on the left side. The handrail was designed by Brian Rourke in 1979 and is decorated with representations of the local industry. The middle stage of the tower contains small chamfered windows on each side and a clock face on the west side. The top stage has louvred, arched bell openings, and roundels containing quatrefoils. The bays of the nave are separated by shallow buttresses, and each bay contains a large lancet window. The east window consists of three equal lancets. The east window and the windows in the tower contain stained glass designed by George Wragge and date from the 1930s. External features The churchyard contains the war graves of two soldiers of World War I and a soldier of World War II.

By virtue of its education and training functions it is a charitable organisation and is funded by its members to promote the magistracy. History The idea of forming an association of magistrates came from a Derby magistrate, Alderman Wilkins, in 1920. The inaugural meeting of the Association was held at Central Hall, Westminster on 28 October 1921. Lord Haldane was elected the Association's first President. Thereafter the Lord Chancellor of the day was President, but when the role of the Lord Chancellor changed with the passing of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 the Lord Chief Justice took on the role. By 1945, membership had grown to 5,288 members, and it had 16,354 at its fiftieth Anniversary in 1970. Today, it represents over 80% of active magistrates. It received a Royal Charter in October 1962. Objectives The Association was established to: :\\"promote the sound administration of the law by educating and instructing magistrates and others in the law, the administration of justice, the treatment of offenders and the best methods of preventing crime; and promoting discussion on developments in the law and the administration of justice.\\" Since 1969, it has helped to develop various sentencing guidelines. It also organises conferences and publishes a magazine, Magistrate. Members also participate in local branch activities. The governing body is the Board of Trustees. A Council advises the Board. Various standing committees are populated by Association members and focus on specific areas of magistrates' activities. The current chairman is John Bache JP. Publications The Association publishes a magazine, Magistrate (formerly The Magistrate), several times each year. It has also issued a number of reports which are available from its website.

History of Rome and Nubia Nubia is a historical region around the Nile river, just south of Egypt, in the area today called Sudan. Before Roman times there was in Nubia the Kingdom of Meroe, which flourished together with the civilization of ancient Egypt. Rome's conquest of Egypt led to border incursions by Mero√´ beyond the Roman borders. In 23 BC the Roman governor of Egypt, Publius Petronius, to end the Meroitic raids, invaded Nubia in response to a Nubian attack on southern Egypt, pillaging the north of the region and sacking Napata (22 BC) before returning home. In retaliation, the Nubians crossed the lower border of Egypt and looted many statues (among other things) from the Egyptian towns near the first cataract of the Nile at Aswan. Roman forces later reclaimed many of the statues intact, and others were returned following the peace treaty signed in 22 BC between Rome and Meroe. One looted head though, from a statue of the emperor Augustus, was buried under the steps of a temple. In \\"The Deeds of the Divine Augustus,\\" Augustus claims that \\"a penetration was made as far as the town of Napata, which is next to Meroe...\\"Augustus, \\"The Deeds of the Divine Augustus,\\" Exploring the European Past: Texts & Images, Second Edition, ed. Timothy E. Gregory (Mason: Thomson, 2008), 119. Meroe eventually settled down to a healthy trading relationship with Rome and the Mediterranean. However, the Kingdom of Meroe began to fade as a power by the 1st or 2nd century AD, sapped by the war with Roman Egypt, the decline of its traditional industries and the increasingly destructive attacks from the Blemmyes. Indeed, at the end of the 2nd century AD, the Nobatae occupied the Nile's west bank in northern Kush. They are believed to have been one of several well-armed bands of horse- and camel-borne warriors who sold their agility to the Meroitic Population for protection; eventually they intermarried and established themselves among the Meroitic people as a military aristocracy. Until nearly the 5th century, Rome subsidized the Nobatae and used Meroe as a buffer between Egypt and the Blemmyes. Meanwhile, the old Meroitic kingdom contracted because of the expansion of the powerful Ethiopic Kingdom of Aksum to the east. By AD 350, King Ezana of Axum had captured and destroyed Meroe city, ending the kingdom's independent existence, and conquering its territory into modern-day northern Sudan. Rome's client state? Nubia was never dominated by the Romans, but in Augustan times there was possibly a \\"client state\\" of Rome in northern Nubia. Strabo describes a war with the Romans in the 1st century BC. After the initial victories of Kandake (or \\"Candace\\") Amanirenas against Roman Egypt, the Kushites of northern Nubia were defeated and Napata sacked.Arthur E. Robinson, \\"The Arab Dynasty of Dar For (Darfur): Part II\\", Journal of the Royal African Society (Lond). XXVIII: 55-67 (October, 1928) (http://afraf.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/repr...) Remarkably, the destruction of the capital of Napata was not a crippling blow to the Kushites and did not frighten Candace enough to prevent her from again engaging in combat with the Roman military. Indeed, it seems that Petronius's attack might have had a revitalizing influence on the kingdom. Just three years later, in 22 BC, a large Kushite force moved northward with intention of attacking Qasr Ibrim. Alerted to the advance, Petronius again marched south and managed to reach Qasr Ibrim and bolster its defences before the invading Kushites arrived. Although the ancient sources give no description of the ensuing battle, we know that at some point the Kushites sent ambassadors to negotiate a peace settlement with Petronius and possibly accept a status like \\"Client State\\" of Rome. By the end of the second campaign after other years of fighting, however, Petronius was in no mood to deal further with the Kushites. The Kushites succeeded in negotiating a peace treaty on favourable terms. and trade between the two nations increased. It is possible that the Roman emperor Nero planned another attempt to fully conquer Kush before his death in AD 68.Jackson, Robert.At Empire's Edge: Exploring Rome's Egyptian Frontier Yale University Press Yale, 2002 (https://books.google.com/books?id=pkBctdZcn84C&printsec;=frontcover) Kush began to fade as a power by the 1st or 2nd century AD, sapped by the war with the Roman province of Egypt and the decline of its traditional industries.The Story of Africa, BBC World Service In Nubia, Christianity began to gain over the old phaoronic religion since the first contacts with Roman Christians, and by the mid-sixth century AD the Kingdom of Kush/Meroe was dissolved, and replaced by the kingdoms of Makuria, Nobadia, and Alodia.

He works on child development and strategies for dealing with stress.  Biography  Doc Lew Childre Jr. is the son of Doc Lew Childre Sr., the Grand Ole Opry star best known for his song \\"Let's Go Fishing\\". The prefix \\"Doc\\" was inherited from his father. His mother is Eleanor B. Fields. Childre grew up in Goldsboro, NC, attending St. Mary's Catholic School and New Hope High School. He left school in the 11th grade. After serving in the National Guard, Childre started a recording studio in Boulder Creek, California. In his early twenties, he developed some health problems that caused him to look for alternative treatments and that is when he began researching stress. In 1991, he set up the Institute of HeartMath (now called HeartMath Institute) as a nonprofit research and education organization. The institute conducted experiments in how the right sounds can, according to HeartMath, help align a person's heart and mind energies; for example by monitoring EKG and blood pressure of subjects listening to various sounds, it would be possible to tailor sounds to invoke a specific response. In 1992, he released his first commercial music recording called \\"Heart Zones\\". It was made with synthesizer and digital drum machine and was said to sound like \\"Andreas Vollenweider meets Pink Floyd meets Kenny G meets the Moody Blues\\". There are four short songs, each played twice, for a total of 34 minutes of music. Childre claimed it would help reduce stress and enhance intuition and creativity. The music was played in alternative radio stations in 35 of the nation's largest 100 markets, and remained on the Billboard charts for over a year. It was the first music for stress reduction ever to make the list. Redford Williams, director of the Behavior Medicine Research Center at Duke University, was skeptical of Childre's claims saying Childre had \\"no basis for drawing any of these conclusions\\" about stress reduction, saying \\"there's only one standard to judge, and that's by the presentation to the medical community of findings in research that pass a muster called peer review.\\" Childre's claim that his music could invoke a specific response was met with skepticism by Diana Deutsch, a psychology professor at the University of California, San Diego and editor of the journal Music Perception, which publishes articles on research dealing with music psychology. Deutsch said, \\"If he [Childre] has got it, it's going to be an all-time first.\\"  Bibliography  Select books * Doc Childre, Howard Martin and Donna Beech: The HeartMath Solution: The Institute of HeartMath's Revolutionary Program for Engaging the Power of the Heart's Intelligence.

It carried out the deadly Tokyo subway sarin attack in 1995 and was found to have been responsible for another smaller sarin attack the previous year. The group has never confessed; they claim that those who carried out attacks did so secretly, without being known to other executives and ordinary believers. Asahara broadcast his singing, insisting on his innocence through a radio broadcast relayed from Russia and directed toward Japan. On 6 July 2018, after exhausting all appeals, Asahara and six followers were executed as a punishment for the 1995 attacks and other crimes, and the remaining six on death row were executed on 26 July.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world- asia-44962581 At 12:10 am, on New Year's Day 2019, at least nine people were injured (one seriously) when a car was deliberately driven into crowds celebrating the new year on Takeshita Street in Tokyo. Local police reported the arrest of Kazuhiro Kusakabe, the suspected driver, who allegedly admitted to intentionally ramming his vehicle into crowds to protest his opposition to the death penalty, specifically in retaliation for the execution of the aforementioned Aum cult members. Aum Shinrikyo, which split into Aleph and Hikari no Wa in 2007, had already been formally designated a terrorist organization by several countries, including Russia, Canada, Kazakhstan, the United States, as well as the European Union. The Public Security Intelligence Agency considered Aleph and Hikari no Wa to be branches of a \\"dangerous religion\\"National Police Agency (Japan) (2009), , GYOSEI Corporation, pg. 160. and it announced in January 2015 that they would remain under surveillance for three more years. The Tokyo District Court canceled the extension to surveillance of Hikari no Wa in 2017 following legal challenges from the group, but continued to keep Aleph under watch. The government appealed the cancellation, and in February 2019 the Tokyo High Court overturned the lower court's decision, reinstating the surveillance, citing no major changes between Aum Shinrikyo and Hikari no Wa. Doctrine Shinrikyo Aum is a syncretic belief system that draws upon Asahara's idiosyncratic interpretations of elements of early Indian Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism, as well as Hinduism, taking Shiva as the main image of worship and incorporating millennialist ideas from Christianity, Yoga, and the writings of Nostradamus. Its founder, Chizuo Matsumoto, claimed that he sought to restore \\"original Buddhism\\" but employed Christian millenarian rhetoric. In 1992, Matsumoto, who had changed his name to Shoko Asahara, published a foundational book, declaring himself to be \\"Christ\\", Japan's only fully enlightened master, as well as identifying himself as the \\"Lamb of God\\". Asahara's purported mission was to take upon himself the sins of the world, and he claimed he could transfer spiritual power to his followers and ultimately take away their sins and bad deeds. While some reject Aum Shinrikyo's claims of Buddhist characteristics and affiliations with Buddhism, other scholars refer to it as an offshoot of Japanese Buddhism, and this was how the movement generally defined and saw itself. Asahara outlined a doomsday prophecy, which included a third world war instigated by the United States. According to Robert Jay Lifton, an American psychiatrist and author: Humanity would end, except for the elite few who joined Aum. Aum's mission was not only to spread the word of salvation, but also to survive these End Times. Asahara predicted that Armageddon would occur in 1997. Kaplan notes that in his lectures, Shoko Asahara referred to the United States as \\"The Beast\\" from the Book of Revelation, predicting it would eventually attack Japan. Arthur Goldwag, author of a book on conspiracies and secret societies, characterizes Asahara as one who \\"saw dark conspiracies everywhere promulgated by Jews, Freemasons, the Dutch, the British royal family, and rival Japanese religions\\". In the opinion of Daniel A. Metraux, Aum Shinrikyo justified its violence through its own unique interpretation of Buddhist ideas and doctrines, such as the Buddhist concepts of Mapp≈ç and Sh≈çb≈ç. Aum claimed that by bringing about the end of the world, they would restore Sh≈çb≈ç. Furthermore, Lifton believes, Asahara \\"interpreted the Tibetan Buddhist concept of phowa in order to claim that by killing someone contrary to the group's aims, they were preventing them from accumulating bad karma and thus saving them\\". The name , usually rendered in English as \\"Aum Supreme Truth\\", derives from the Sanskrit syllable Aum, used to represent the universe, followed by the Japanese Shinrikyo (meaning, roughly, \\"Teaching of Truth\\") written in kanji. (In Japanese, kanji are used to write both words that are originally Japanese as well as Sino- xenic words, but they are not usually used to transcribe those which are borrowed directly from \\"exotic foreign languages\\".) In 2000, the organization changed its name to \\"Aleph\\" (a reference to the first letter of the Phoenician, Hebrew, and Arabic alphabets), and it also replaced its logo. History The movement was founded by Shoko Asahara in his one-bedroom apartment in Tokyo's Shibuya ward in 1984, starting off as a yoga and meditation class known as and steadily grew in the following years. It gained official status as a religious organization in 1989 and attracted a considerable number of graduates from Japan's elite universities, thus being dubbed a \\"religion for the elite\\". Early activities Although Aum was, from the beginning, considered controversial in Japan, it was not initially associated with serious crimes. It was during this period that Asahara became obsessed with Biblical prophecies. Aum's public relations activities included publishing comics and animated cartoons that attempted to tie its religious ideas to popular anime and manga themes, including space missions, powerful weapons, world conspiracies, and quest for ultimate truth. Aum published several magazines including Vajrayana Sacca and Enjoy Happiness, adopting a somewhat missionary attitude. Isaac Asimov's science fiction Foundation Trilogy was referenced \\"depicting as it does an elite group of spiritually evolved scientists forced to go underground during an age of barbarism so as to prepare themselves for the moment...when they will emerge to rebuild civilization\\". Lifton posited that Aum's publications used Christian and Buddhist ideas to impress what he considered to be the more shrewd and educated Japanese who were not attracted to boring, purely traditional sermons. In private, both Asahara and his top disciples reportedly continued their humble lifestyles, the only exception being the armored Mercedes-Benz gifted by a wealthy follower. Advertising and recruitment activities, dubbed the \\"Aum Salvation plan\\", included claims of curing physical illnesses with health improvement techniques, realizing life goals by improving intelligence and positive thinking, and concentrating on what was important at the expense of leisure. This was to be accomplished by practising ancient teachings, accurately translated from original Pali sutras (these three were referred to as \\"threefold salvation\\"). These efforts resulted in Aum becoming one of the fastest-growing religious groups in Japan's history. David E. Kaplan and Andrew Marshall, in their 1996 book, The Cult at the End of the World: The Terrifying Story of the Aum Doomsday Cult, from the Subways of Tokyo to the Nuclear Arsenals of Russia, claim that its practices remained secret. Initiation rituals, assert the authors of the book, often involved the use of hallucinogens, such as LSD. Religious practices often involved extremely ascetic practices claimed to be \\"yoga\\". These included everything from renunciants being hung upside down to being given shock therapy. Incidents before 1995 The cult started attracting controversy in the late 1980s with accusations of deception of recruits, holding cult members against their will, forcing members to donate money and murdering a cult member who tried to leave in February 1989. In October 1989, the group's negotiations with Tsutsumi Sakamoto, an anti-cult lawyer threatening a lawsuit against them which could potentially bankrupt the group, failed. In the same month, Sakamoto recorded an interview for a talk show on the Japanese TV station TBS. The network then had the interview secretly shown to the group without notifying Sakamoto, intentionally breaking protection of sources. The group then pressured TBS to cancel the broadcast. The following month Sakamoto, his wife and his child went missing from their home in Yokohama. The police were unable to resolve the case at the time, although some of his colleagues publicly voiced their suspicions of the group. It was not until after the 1995 Tokyo attack that they were found to have been murdered and their bodies dumped by cult members. Kaplan and Marshall allege in their book that Aum was also connected with such activities as extortion. The group, authors report, \\"commonly took patients into its hospitals and then forced them to pay exorbitant medical bills\\". The cult is known to have considered assassinations of several individuals critical of the cult, such as the heads of Buddhist sects Soka Gakkai and The Institute for Research in Human Happiness. After cartoonist Yoshinori Kobayashi began satirizing the cult, he was included on Aum's assassination list. An assassination attempt was made on Kobayashi in 1993. In July 1993, cult members sprayed large amounts of liquid containing Bacillus anthracis spores from a cooling tower on the roof of Aum Shinrikyo's Tokyo headquarters. However, their plan to cause an anthrax epidemic failed. The attack resulted in a large number of complaints about bad odors but no infections. At the end of 1993, the cult started secretly manufacturing the nerve agent sarin and, later, VX gas. They also attempted to manufacture 1,000 automatic rifles but only managed to make one. According to the testimony of Kenichi Hirose at the Tokyo District Court in 2000, he mentioned that Asahara wanted the group to be self-sufficient in manufacturing AK-74shttps://web.archive.org/web/20190412133948/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2000/07/08/national/cultist- says-asahara-ordered-1000-machineguns-be-made/#.XLCVT-fgpPY with one working model smuggled secretly to Japan in order to be studied and used as a basis for future Aum-made AK-74s.https://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2018/10/25/aum- shinrikyo-death-cult-made-ak74-assault-rifles/ Police seized AK-74 components and blueprints from a vehicle used by an Aum member on April 6, 1995.https://fas.org/irp/congress/1995_rpt/aum/part04.htm Aum tested its sarin on sheep at Banjawarn Station, a remote pastoral property in Western Australia, killing 29 sheep. Both sarin and VX were then used in several assassinations (and attempts) over 1994‚Äì95. On the night of 27 June 1994, the cult carried out a chemical weapons attack against civilians when they released sarin in the central Japanese city of Matsumoto, Nagano. With the help of a converted refrigerator truck, members of the cult released a cloud of sarin which floated near the homes of judges who were overseeing a lawsuit concerning a real-estate dispute which was predicted to go against the cult. This Matsumoto incident killed eight and harmed 500 more. Police investigations focused only on an innocent local resident, Yoshiyuki Kouno, and failed to implicate the cult at the time. It was only after the Tokyo subway attack that Aum Shinrikyo was discovered to be behind the Matsumoto sarin attack. In December 1994 and January 1995, Masami Tsuchiya of Aum Shinrikyo synthesized 100 to 200 grams of VX which was used to attack three persons. Two persons were injured and a 28-year-old man was killed. He is believed to be the first fully documented victim of VX. The VX victim, whom Shoko Asahara had suspected was a spy, was attacked at 7:00 a.m. on 12 December 1994, on the street in Osaka by Tomomitsu Niimi and another Aum member, who sprinkled the nerve agent on his neck. He chased them for about before collapsing, dying 10 days later without coming out of a deep coma. Doctors in the hospital suspected at the time he had been poisoned with an organophosphate pesticide. But the cause of death was pinned down only after cult members arrested for the subway attack in Tokyo in March 1995 confessed to the killing. Ethyl methylphosphonate, methylphosphonic acid, and diisopropyl-2-(methylthio) ethylamine were later found in the body of the victim. Unlike the cases for sarin (Matsumoto incident and Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway), VX was not used for mass murder. In February 1995, several cult members kidnapped Kiyoshi Kariya, a 69-year-old brother of a member who had escaped, from a Tokyo street and took him to a compound in Kamikuishiki near Mount Fuji, where he was killed. His corpse was destroyed in a microwave- powered incinerator and the remnants disposed of in Lake Kawaguchi. Before Kariya was abducted, he had been receiving threatening phone calls demanding to know the whereabouts of his sister, and he had left a note saying, \\"If I disappear, I was abducted by Aum Shinrikyo\\". Police made plans to simultaneously raid cult facilities across Japan in March 1995. Prosecutors alleged Asahara was tipped off about this and that he ordered the Tokyo subway attack to divert police. Tokyo subway sarin attack and related incidents On the morning of 20 March 1995, Aum members released a binary chemical weapon, most closely chemically similar to sarin, in a coordinated attack on five trains in the Tokyo subway system, killing 13 commuters, seriously injuring 54 and affecting 980 more. Some estimates claim as many as 6,000 people were injured by the sarin. It is difficult to obtain exact numbers since many victims are reluctant to come forward.Haruki Murakami, Alfred Birnbaum, Philip Gabriel, Underground, Vintage International, 2001. Prosecutors allege that Asahara was tipped off by an insider about planned police raids on cult facilities and ordered an attack in central Tokyo to divert police attention away from the group. The attack evidently backfired, and police conducted huge simultaneous raids on cult compounds across the country.Danzig, Richard, Marc Sageman, Terrance Leighton, Lloyd Hough, Hidemi Yuki, Rui Kotani and Zachary M. Hosford, \\"Aum Shinrikyo: Insights Into How Terrorists Develop Biological and Chemical Weapons \\", Center for a New American Security, July 2011; accessed 12 July 2018. Over the next week, the full scale of Aum's activities was revealed for the first time. At the cult's headquarters in Kamikuishiki on the foot of Mount Fuji, police found explosives, chemical weapons, and a Russian Mil Mi-17 military helicopter. While the finding of biological warfare agents such as anthrax and Ebola cultures was reported, those claims now appear to have been widely exaggerated. There were stockpiles of chemicals that could be used for producing enough sarin to kill four million people. Police also found laboratories to manufacture drugs such as LSD, methamphetamine, and a crude form of truth serum, a safe containing millions of U.S. dollars in cash and gold, and cells, many still containing prisoners. During the raids, Aum issued statements claiming that the chemicals were for fertilizers. Over the next six weeks, over 150 cult members were arrested for a variety of offenses. The media was stationed outside Aum's Tokyo headquarters on Komazawa Dori in Aoyama for months after the attack and arrests waiting for action and to get images of the cult's other members. On 30 March 1995, Takaji Kunimatsu, chief of the National Police Agency, was shot four times near his house in Tokyo and was seriously wounded. While many suspected Aum involvement in the shooting, the Sankei Shimbun reported that Hiroshi Nakamura is suspected of the crime, but nobody has been charged. On 23 April 1995, Hideo Murai, the head of Aum's Ministry of Science, was stabbed to death outside the cult's Tokyo headquarters amidst a crowd of about 100 reporters, in front of cameras. The man responsible, a Korean member of Yamaguchi-gumi, was arrested and eventually convicted of the murder. His motive remains unknown. On the evening of 5 May, a burning paper bag was discovered in a toilet in Tokyo's busy Shinjuku station. Upon examination it was revealed that it was a hydrogen cyanide device which, had it not been extinguished in time, would have released enough gas into the ventilation system to potentially kill 10,000 commuters. On 4 July, several undetonated cyanide devices were found at other locations in the Tokyo subway. During this time, numerous cult members were arrested for various offenses, but arrests of the most senior members on the charge of the subway gassing had not yet taken place. In June, an individual unrelated to Aum had launched a copycat attack by hijacking All Nippon Airways Flight 857, a Boeing 747 bound for Hakodate from Tokyo. The hijacker claimed to be an Aum member in possession of sarin and plastic explosives, but these claims were ultimately found to be false. Asahara was finally found hiding within a wall of a cult building known as \\"The 6th Satian\\" in the Kamikuishiki complex on 16 May and was arrested. On the same day, the cult mailed a parcel bomb to the office of Yukio Aoshima, the governor of Tokyo, blowing off the fingers of his secretary's hand. Asahara was initially charged with 23 counts of murder and 16 other offenses. The trial, dubbed \\"the trial of the century\\" by the press, ruled Asahara guilty of masterminding the attack and sentenced him to death. The indictment was appealed unsuccessfully. A number of senior members accused of participation, such as Masami Tsuchiya, also received death sentences. The reasons why a small circle of mostly senior Aum members committed atrocities and the extent of personal involvement by Asahara remain unclear, although several theories have attempted to explain these events. In response to the prosecution's charge that Asahara ordered the subway attacks to distract authorities, the defense maintained that Asahara was not aware of events, pointing to his deteriorating health. Shortly after his arrest, Asahara abandoned his post as the organization's leader, and since then has maintained silence, refusing to communicate even with lawyers and family members. After 1995 An anti-Aum Shinrikyo protest in Japan, 2009. On 21 June 1995, Asahara acknowledged that in January 1994 he ordered the killing of a sect member, Kotaro Ochida, a pharmacist at an Aum hospital. Ochida, who tried to escape from a sect compound, was held down and strangled by another Aum member who was allegedly told that he too would be killed if he did not strangle Ochida. On 10 October 1995, Aum Shinrikyo was ordered stripped of its official status as a \\"religious legal entity\\" and was declared bankrupt in early 1996. However, the group continues to operate under the constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion, funded by a successful computer business and donations, and under strict surveillance. Attempts to ban the group altogether under the 1952 Subversive Activities Prevention Law were rejected by the Public Security Examination Commission in January 1997. The group underwent a number of transformations in the aftermath of Asahara's arrest and trial. For a brief time, Asahara's two preteen sons officially replaced him as guru. It re-grouped under the new name \\"Aleph\\" in February 2000. It announced a change in doctrine: religious texts related to controversial Vajrayana Buddhist doctrines and the Bible were removed. The group apologized to the victims of the sarin gas attack and established a special compensation fund. Provocative publications and activities that alarmed society are no longer published. Fumihiro Joyu, one of the few senior leaders of the group under Asahara who did not face serious charges, became official head of the organization in 1999. K≈çki Ishii, a legislator who formed an anti-Aum committee in the National Diet in 1999, was murdered in 2002. For over 15 years, only three fugitives were being actively sought. At 11:50 p.m. on 31 December 2011, Makoto Hirata surrendered himself to the police and was arrested on suspicion of being involved in the 1995 abduction of Kiyoshi Kariya, a non-member who had died during an Aum kidnapping and interrogation.Kyodo News, \\"16-year Aum fugitive mum on life on run\\", Japan Times, January 2011, pg. 1. On 3 June 2012, police captured Naoko Kikuchi, the second fugitive, acting on a tip from local residents. Acting on information from the capture of Kikuchi, including recent photographs showing a modified appearance, the last remaining fugitive, Katsuya Takahashi, was captured on 15 June 2012. He is said to have been the driver in the Tokyo gas attack and was caught in Tokyo, having been on the run for 17 years. On 6 July 2018, Asahara and six other Aum Shinrikyo members were executed by hanging. Japan's Justice Minister Y≈çko Kamikawa stated that the crimes \\"plunged people, not only in Japan but in other countries as well, into deadly fear and shook society to its core.\\" Amnesty International criticized use of the death penalty in the case. While executions are rare in Japan, they have public support according to surveys. There were 13 members on death row at the time: An anti-Aum Shinrikyo banner in 2014. Aum Shinrikyo members executed on 6 July 2018: * Shoko Asahara, leader of Aum Shinrikyo * Yoshihiro Inoue Aum's \\"head of intelligence\\" and chief coordinator of the Tokyo subway attack * Tomomitsu Niimi, the getaway driver for Ikuo Hayashi, one of the perpetrators of the Tokyo subway attack * Tomomasa Nakagawa, a perpetrator of the Sakamoto family murder * Kiyohide Hayakawa, Aum's \\"construction minister\\", convicted of strangling a young cult member in 1989 suspected of dissidence * Seiichi Endo, the \\"head scientist\\" of Aum Shinrikyo * Masami Tsuchiya, Aum Shinrikyo's chief chemist and director of the sarin gas manufacturing The six remaining Aum Shinrikyo members were executed on 26 July 2018.https://japantoday.com/category/crime/Japan-hangs-all-6-remaining-AUM- death-row-inmates * Yasuo Hayashi, a perpetrator of the Tokyo subway attack * Kenichi Hirose, a perpetrator of the Tokyo subway attack * Toru Toyoda, a perpetrator of the Tokyo subway attack * Masato Yokoyama, a perpetrator of the Tokyo subway attack * Kazuaki Okazaki, a perpetrator of the Sakamoto family murder * Satoro Hashimoto, a perpetrator of the Sakamoto family murder Shoko Asahara's ashes will be collected by his youngest daughter according to his will. She urged her relatives and cult members to \\"put an end to the Aum and stop hating society\\". The ashes will be kept at the detention center for the time being for fears of reprisals from other elements of the cult. Current activities Aleph According to a June 2005 report by the National Police Agency, Aleph had approximately 1,650 members, of whom 650 lived communally in compounds. The group operated 26 facilities in 17 prefectures, and about 120 residential facilities. An article in the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper on 11 September 2002 showed that the Japanese public still mistrusts Aleph, and compounds are usually surrounded by protest banners from local residents. Monitoring In January 2000, the group was placed under surveillance for a period of three years under an anti-Aum law, in which the group is required to submit a list of members and details of assets to the authorities. In January 2003, Japan's Public Security Intelligence Agency received permission to extend the surveillance for another three years, as they found evidence which suggested that the group still revered Asahara. According to the Religious News Blog report issued in April 2004, the authorities still considered the group \\"a threat to society\\". On 15 September 2006, Shoko Asahara lost his final appeal against the death penalty. The following day Japanese police raided the offices of Aleph in order to \\"prevent any illegal activities by cult members in response to the confirmation of Asahara's death sentence\\". Thirteen cult members were eventually sentenced to death.Hongo, Jun, \\"Last trial brings dark Aum era to end\\", Japan Times, 22 November 2011, p. 3. Split On 8 March 2007, Fumihiro Joyu, former Aum Shinrikyo spokesman and head of Aum's Moscow operation, formally announced a long- expected split. Joyu's group, called Hikari no Wa (\\"The Circle of Light\\"), claims to be committed to uniting science and religion and creating \\"the new science of the human mind\\", having previously aimed to move the group away from its criminal history and toward its spiritual roots. In April 2011, the Public Security Intelligence Agency stated that Aum had about 1,500 members. In July 2011 the cult reported its membership as 1,030. The group was reportedly active in trying to recruit new members via social media and proselytizing on college campuses. Japan's Public Security Examination Commission announced in January 2015 that Aum Shinrikyo's two spinoffs would remain under surveillance for three more years starting 1 February 2015. Admirers In 2014, The Japan Times alleged that \\"good looks and commitment to a cause\\", demonstrated by Aleph, \\"inspire a new generation of admirers\\". Dissatisfaction with society and low degrees of success in life make them \\"identify with the cult\\" and \\"adore the cultists as if they were pop idols\\".  2013 investigation and media coverage  PSIA officers conduct a surprise inspection on a suspected Aleph building in 2013. Sometime after April 2013, the Public Security Intelligence Agency took a photograph inside of Aleph's facilities. In this photograph, a bundle of papers is pierced with a knife on an altar-like object. The papers included photographs of PSIA employees and directors, police officers, and lawyer Taro Takimoto, who helped followers leave Aum Shinrikyo. At least at this point in time, Aleph still displayed portraits of Shoko Asahara and demanded followers' dependence using videos of Asahara. 2016 Russian crackdown On 5 April 2016, the Investigative Committee of Russia announced it opened a criminal case against Aum Shinrikyo followers and that its investigators, along with Federal Security Service (FSB) forces, were conducting raids in Moscow and Saint Petersburg to find them and confiscate literature, religious items and electronic information. On 20 September 2016, the Russian government banned Aum Shinrikyo in the country, declaring it a terrorist organization.Russia bans murderous Japanese sect Aum Shinrikyo as terrorist group, rt.com; accessed 12 July 2018. 2017 Aleph raids In November 2017, Japanese police raided five offices of Aleph in an investigation into the group's recruiting practices after a woman paid tens of thousands of yen for study sessions.  2019 Tokyo car attack  On 1 January 2019, in Tokyo, Aum sympathizer Kazuhiro Kusakabe told authorities he intentionally rammed into pedestrians crowded into narrow Takeshita Street in Harajuku district as a terrorist attack in \\"retaliation for an execution\\". It remains unclear whether he was referencing the 2018 executions of Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult members directly or making a broader statement. The attack, on New Year's Day, left eight injured. A ninth person was also directly injured by the driver.

Founded in 1947, it is now one of the oldest privately held manufacturing corporations in the United States.About Etco Some of ETCO's major areas of operation include manufacturing of wall socket, auto parts, custom metal parts, precision metal stampings for appliances and other metal based products. In 2011, it merged operations of its North and South divisions while maintaining two autonomous manufacturing locations based in Warwick, Rhode Island, and Bradenton, Florida. ETCO's products can be found in electronic home appliances sold by several major appliance manufacturers. The products can also be found in cars sold by automotive manufacturers as well as medical and telecommunications companies. ETCO remains a family-owned business, as descendants of the founder (from the Dunn Family) own over 85% of the company. As a result, most of its growth has been due to reinvestment of the company's own earnings rather than public financing. History ETCO Incorporated was founded in 1947 as Electric Terminal Corporation by Joe Dunn in Warwick, Rhode Island. Years later, his son David Dunn purchased a majority stake in the company and sought to build several divisions; successfully integrating Zero Defects process in its manufacturing operations. The company grew throughout the 70s, 80s and 90s being awarded over 30 manufacturing process patents and producing nearly half of all plug blades manufactured in the US in 2011.ThomasNet, Etco Company profile Page Zero Defects Policy ETCO's stated manufacturing objective is zero defects in the course of parts production. The products manufactured at ETCO's plants go through a rigorous quality assurance process including machine review and visual inspection by hand to ensure that it adheres to the zero defect principle of Philip B. Crosby.BusinessWeek - Phillip Crosby Associates Information Page Relying on this Quality Management principle, ETCO's management contends that it has been able to implement methodologies that have led to savings throughout the products manufacturing lifecycle. Arguments exist that oppose the Zero Defects Policy including W. Edwards Deming who stated that the philosophy is more a fad and would lose favor. Dr. Deming stressed the importance of establishing a level of variation, or anomalies, acceptable to the recipient (or customer) in the next phase of a process. Often, some defects are quite acceptable, and efforts to remove all defects would be an excessive waste of time and money. Another criticism leveled at the Zero Defect manufacturing philosophy is the cost inherent with implementing it versus the benefits achieved post- implementation. Coil on Plug Research ETCO released a technical report detailing results of comparative testing conducted at their R&D; facility. This report titled ‚ÄúUnder the Boot‚Äù was published after a series of consumer complaints, research and articles involving Coil on Plug ignition systems.New York Times Wheels Blog, January 2011 There were also Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) issued by automobile manufacturers from automotive manufacturers including Acura/HondaAcura Technical Service Bulletin, April 1997 that caused the company to release the white paper on this research. The main focus of the research looked at the spring-like connection devices. The connection devices used to supply the current's path from coil to plug were not as robust as the \\"mated fit\\" terminal to terminal connections required on wired ignition systems. These Coil on Plug devices do not have the retention values demanded by SAE ( Society Automotive Engineers ) Standard J2032 3.2.1 for High Voltage Ignition cable assemblies.SAE High Voltage Ignition Cable Assemblies Page Proponents of Coil on Plug technology cite cost and ease of use as primary advantages when compared to standard wire assemblies.

It was acquired in April 1934 from Wheeler Shipbuilding in Brooklyn, New York, for $7,495. \\"Pilar\\" was a nickname for Hemingway's second wife, Pauline, and also the name of the woman leader of the partisan band in his 1940 novel of the Spanish Civil War, For Whom the Bell Tolls. Hemingway regularly fished off the boat in the waters of Key West, Florida, Marquesas Keys, and the Gulf Stream off the Cuban coast. He made three trips with the boat to the Bimini islands wherein his fishing, drinking, and fighting exploits drew much attention and remain part of the history of the islands. In addition to fishing trips on Pilar, Hemingway contributed to scientific research which included collaboration with the Smithsonian Institution. Several of Hemingway's books were influenced by time spent on the boat, most notably, The Old Man and the Sea (1953) and Islands in the Stream (1970). The yacht also inspired the name of Playa Pilar (Pilar Beach) on Cayo Guillermo. A smaller replica of the boat is depicted in the opening and other scenes in the 2012 film Hemingway & Gellhorn. Ernest Hemingway and Carlos Gutierrez aboard Pilar Acquisition Scale model of Pilar on display at Hemingway's home in Key West Hemingway acquired the boat on April 18, 1934, after returning from a safari in Africa. The boat was a modified version of the Wheeler Playmate line. The final price for the boat was $7,495 which included modifications such as a livewell to contain fish, dual-engine set-up, lowering the boat's transom by twelve inches and adding a full-width roller on the stern to aid in hauling large fish onto the boat. A flying bridge was added at a later date, but not by Wheeler. The boat's hull was painted black as opposed to the stock white color. The boat was constructed in the Coney Island yard of the Wheeler company, now of Chapel Hill, NC (which also built Fidel Castro's \\"Granma\\"), and delivered to Hemingway at Miami, attached to a wooden cradle which was part of the purchase price. Hemingway, with a friend and a Wheeler representative, sailed the boat under its own power from Miami to Key West through Hawk Channel, a semi- protected waterway from Biscayne National Park to Key West, lying between the Key islands and the barrier reefs.U.S. Geological Survey Circular 1134 - Florida Reef Tract Accessed December 16, 2010 Science on the boat In addition to hunting, Hemingway was an avid fisherman and a great contributor to the development of the sport. He also contributed to the knowledge of Atlantic marine life. During his first visit to Cuba with Pilar, Hemingway hosted Charles Cadwalader, director of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural History and Henry Fowler, the Academy's chief ichthyologist. These two scientists were in Cuba trying to determine the taxonomy of marlin species. They were attempting to determine if white, blue, black, or striped marlin were different species, or just color variants of the same species. As a result of their efforts on the boat, they reclassified the North Atlantic marlin variants. U-boat patrols During World War II, Hemingway used his boat to search for German U-boats in the Caribbean waters. Pilar was outfitted with communications gear including HF/DF or ‚ÄúHuff-Duff‚Äù direction-finding equipment. His minimal armament included a Thompson sub machine gun and hand grenades. Most accounts state that any effort to attack a submarine would be futile. Hemingway wrote about his intent to attack if he spotted a sub. Other accounts of these patrols imply that they were a farce and that he did them in return for extra gas rations and immunity from Cuban police for driving drunk. His hunting for U-Boats was inspiration for the third act, \\"At Sea\\", in his novel Islands in the Stream. Bimini trips Ernest Hemingway with his wife and children, Bimini, 1935 Hemingway spent three summers in Bimini, starting with the first voyage in April, 1935. During the initial attempt at the crossing, he accidentally shot himself in the leg while attempting to boat a shark he caught. On a subsequent trip, he fished with Bror von Blixen-Finecke, with whom he had been on a safari and whose former wife was Karen Blixen, author of Out of Africa. There are ties to him and Hemingway through Hemingway's books Green Hills of Africa and Under Kilimanjaro. During the Bimini trips, Hemingway perfected fishing techniques for tuna. He was the first person to land a giant tuna unmutilated. Known as \\"apple-coring\\", it had been common for sharks to attack fish as they tired and were near to the boat. His technique involved applying constant pressure, \\"pump and reel\\", to the fish wherein previous techniques allowed the fish to run in an effort to tire it. He would attempt to boat the fish as soon as possible. He experimented with using a skiff whereby he would transfer to the smaller boat with the intent of having the fish pull the boat and then tire. He also discovered marlin had a defense mechanism in their swords and noses that made them unattractive to sharks but that tuna lacked such a defense. Hemingway and Henry (\\"Mike\\") Strater with the remaining 500 lbs of marlinHe found a tuna's primary defense against the sharks was speed and as the fish tired they became easy targets. He carried a Thompson sub-machine gun which he used to shoot the sharks as the tuna tired and neared the boat. The photo to the right depicts Hemingway and Henry (\\"Mike\\") Strater with a half-eaten (\\"apple-cored\\") marlin. This fish weighed more than 500 lbs in its half eaten state. It was projected to be more than 1,000 lbs when whole. During the landing of the fish, Hemingway used a Thompson machine gun to shoot the sharks in an attempt to ward them off. The effect of the shark blood in the water was to attract more sharks, which eventually did their damage to the fish. In the end, the state of the marlin recalls somewhat that of the monster marlin in Hemingway's later masterpiece The Old Man and the Sea. The incident greatly compromised his relationship with Strater because Strater believed Hemingway's bloody use of the machine gun against the sharks to be the primary cause of him losing the largest fish he ever caught. While on Bimini, Hemingway wrote magazine articles for Esquire and worked on his novel, To Have And Have Not. His reputation as a big game angler began to grow. He landed many large tuna and marlin. He also staged boxing matches with the locals, offering $100 (this amount ranged upward to $250 based on various accounts) to anyone who could last a few rounds with him. His fighting was not contained to the ring. During a dockside brawl, he punched and knocked out Joe Knapp, a wealthy magazine publisher. Hemingway at first lived on Pilar. He later moved to a cottage near Brown's Dock and eventually a room at the Compleat Angler Hotel, staying in Room Number 1. Fishing Hemingway caught numerous record-breaking fish from Pilar. In 1935, he won every tournament in the Key West-Havana-Bimini triangle, competing against notable sportsman Michael Lerner and S. Kip Farrington. In 1938 he established a world record by catching seven marlin in one day. He was the first person to ever boat a giant tuna in an undamaged state. This effort was attributed to him pulling the fish into the boat before it had tired thereby preventing sharks from eating it. Hemingway kept meticulous logs of his fishing to include guests, weather, current, conditions, fish caught, and other information. During the first summer of owning the boat, Arnold Samuelson, an aspiring writer, served as deck hand and recorded the dictated logs on paper. He subsequently typed the logs which are on display at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. Samuelson later wrote an account of the summer in book form which was published posthumously by his daughter. Named after him, The Hemingway Fishing Tournament has been held in Cuba since 1950. It is a four-day tournament where contestants go for marlin, tuna, wahoo, and other fish using 50-pound fishing line. Hemingway won the first three years.

The museum is located at Finca Vig√≠a, Hemingway's former home near Havana. Hemingway left the boat to his captain Gregorio Fuentes. Fuentes, one of the hired captains of the boat, is said to have been the basis for the character Santiago from The Old Man and the Sea and Eddie from Islands in the Stream. The boat is now owned by the Cuban government after being donated to the people of Cuba by Fuentes. A replica of Pilar is on display in the Bass Pro Shops store in Islamorada, Florida.

It is notable for setting a record for passenger carrying flights, and was probably intended as a developmental aircraft for the Bl√©riot XXIV Limousine. Design The Type XIII differed considerably from the series of tractor configuration monoplanes with which Louis Bl√©riot is generally associated. It was a high-wing pusher configuration monoplane, with the Gnome engine inset into the trailing edge of the square-tipped wing, which had inset ailerons and was braced by a deep wire-braced truss underneath. The wing was mounted on a conventional wire- braced wooden box girder using six uprights and a pair of substantial diagonal members to transmit the thrust of the engine to the main airframe. The pilot sat immediately in front of the wing leading edge, with the four passengers seated two by two behind him. A front-mounted elevator was carried on two pairs of V-booms, and a fixed lifting horizontal surface with a rectangular rudder above it was mounted on top of the rear of the fuselage structure. The main undercarriage consisted of a pair of wheels each in a trailing arm structure which was free to slide on upright tubes mounted outboard of the fuselage, and sprung by bungee cords. Side view of the Bl√©riot XIII. Operational history On 2 February 1911 L√©on Lemartin broke a world record by flying the Type XIII with eight passengers. Later, he succeeded in flying the aircraft with as many as twelve other people on board. Flights carrying large numbers of people were in vogue in France at the time, and the Aero Club de France introduced a regulation for such record attempts, stipulating that each person should weigh a minimum of . Lamartin's load for his eight- passenger list was reported to have been , so his record would not have been ratified under the new rules. It is, however, still an impressive achievement. The Bl√©riot XXIV Drawing of the Bl√©riot XXIV, taken from the 1912 edition of Jane's All the World's Aircraft In late 1911 Bl√©riot produced an aircraft of similar configuration which had been built to the order of Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe, the Bl√©riot XXIV \\"Limousine\\" (also referred to as the Bleriot Aeronef and the Bleriot Berline), and it is probable that the Type XIII was intended as a developmental aircraft for this machine. This aircraft featured an enclosed cabin with mica windows for the passengers, built by the Rothchild coachbuilding company, with the pilot sitting in front of it, his only protection being a small conical windshield attached to the front outrigger cross-bracing wires. A speaking tube was provided to allow the passengers to communicate with the pilot.The First \\"Aerocar\\"Flight 25 November 1911 It differed considerably from the Type XIII in its constructional details. The wings had elliptical ends, similar to those of the Bl√©riot XI and used wing warping for lateral control. They were conventionally braced using wires, those above the wing being connected to a cabane made up of a pair of inverted V-struts with a longitudinal tube connecting the apexes: under this was a large teardrop shaped fuel tank. The tail surfaces were mounted of four wire- braced booms, and the front elevator on four curved booms attached to the front of the cabin. It was initially powered by a Gnome 14 Omega-Omega, which was later replaced by a Gnome 14 Gamma-Gamma. It was long with a wingspan of and, with fuel but without passengers, weighed 700 kg (1,540 lb). With the 140 hp Gnome fitted it was successfully flown at √âtampes, carrying up to of ballast in place of passengers. Specifications (Type XIII) Notes References *Elliott, Brian A.

The Grinzane Cavour Prize was an Italian literary award established in 1982 by Francesco Meotto. The annual award ceremony took place in the medieval castle of Grinzane Cavour. The goal of the prize was to attract young people to read. The voting system was divided into two phases: first, a jury of literary critics selected finalists, and then they chose an overall winner from the pool of finalists. Special prizes for best new author and lifetime achievement were also awarded. The Grinzane Cavour Prize Association was dissolved on 31 March 2009 as a result of the implication of the organization's president, Giuliano Soria, in an embezzling scheme. Soria used the Grinzane Cavour Prize to gain ‚Ç¨4.5 million in government grants which he then appropriated for his personal use. The assets of the organization were acquired by the Monforte d'Alba Bottari Lattes cultural foundation at a bankruptcy auction in 2010.

In particular, the focus of this project is on \\"people‚Äôs\\" music and has been developed through research and field studies. The Ajam project started in London in early 2010 and has since performed various concerts across Europe, North America and the Middle East. Members Ajam comprises four main members, referred to as \\"the Ajam Family\\" and \\"a rotating cast of Iranian musicians who perform on recordings and tours\\" who are referred to as \\"Ajam‚Äôs Guests\\" and \\"Extended Family\\". The concept of the project was conceived by * Amin Mohammad Fouladi (a.k.a. Amin Ajami) and the core of the Ajam family comprises: * Arash Fayyazi * Nariman Akrami * Sara Fotros  Vocal style and poetry  The soundscape presented in Ajam‚Äôs musical repertoire comprises traditional urban, rural and tribal melodic, and percussion instruments complemented by urban and rock beats and bass lines. \\"Their music presents a blend of rooted, traditional folk music with a contemporary touch\\". Ajam draws influence from various forms of \\"people's\\" music including that of ceremonial and ritualistic practices, the music of work, religious passion-plays and music related to traditional sport. Where relevant, Ajam seeks to utilise native roots-based forms of vocal performance such as Bahr-e-Taveel and ZarbyKhƒÅni‚Äô in preference over borrowed forms such as Rap.  Naming  In various interviews with the members of Ajam, several reasons are cited for the naming of the project. In many countries that neighbour Iran, Ajam is a surrogate term for Persian or Iranian. Other notable definitions for ajam are rooted from an Arabic term to mean, \\"illiterate\\", \\"mute\\", or \\"ineloquent\\". With reference to the latter definitions, and in relation to the naming of the project, Amin Ajami is quoted as saying that ‚Äúwe would rather be illiterate to the language of 'man', but seek fluency in the language of the 'heart'\\".

Origins and education Stephen and John Geree were born in Yorkshire, and studied at Magdalen Hall, Oxford. Stephen, the elder, became a student there in 1611, aged 17, and went through the courses in Logic and Philosophy, taking B.A. in 1615.Anthony a Wood, Athenae Oxonienses (Printed for Tho. Bennet at the Half-Moon in St. Paul's Churchyard, London 1692), II, p. 132.

John entered the College in 1615, aged 14, either as batler or servitor. He graduated B.A. on 27 January 1619, and took his M.A. on 12 June 1621, the same day on which John Tombes took his B.A. from the same College.Athenae Oxonienses, I, 838‚Äì39; II, pp.64‚Äì65. John Geree John Geree made an early appearance in print in 1625, with a dedicatory epistle to the collected lectures of William Pemble of Magdalen Hall, published after his death as Vindiciae Fidei: A Treatise of Justification by Faith.(Richard Capel), Vindiciae fidei, or A treatise of iustification by faith: wherein that point is fully cleared, and vindicated from the cavils of its adversaries.

In November 1627 he was licensed as a preacher throughout the dioceses of London, Gloucester and Worcester, and as preacher and curate in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire.CCEd Person ID: 69581. In 1629 he published at Oxford A Catechisme concerning the Lord's Supper. For refusal to conform to ceremonies of the Church of England he was silenced by Godfrey Goodman, Bishop of Gloucester, and was reduced to living 'by the helps of his brethren.'Athenae Oxonienses, II, pp. 64-65. However, during the later 1630s he continued to defy the suspension in Tewkesbury, and by 1641 he had an enthusiastic following there.D.C. Beaver, Parish Communities and Religious Conflict in the Vale of Gloucester, 1590-1690 (Harvard University Press, 2009), pp. 179-92 (Google preview). In 1641 he was restored to his cure by the Committee for Plundered Ministers.Athenae Oxonienses, II, p. 64. From this date his sermons or tracts recommence, beginning with The Down-Fall of Anti-Christ, dedicated to the Committee itself, and Judah's Joy at the Oath, a sermon celebrating the Parliamentary Covenant, but finding unsoundness in Henry Burton's interpretation of it. In the following year he preached by authority at a public fast on behalf of Ireland (a sermon printed in Dublin and London), and in 1644 published Vindici√¶ Ecclesi√¶ Anglican√¶, a treatise showing the need for reform and the ejection of scandalous ministers, but maintaining that reformed ministry need not entail separation from the Church of England. It affirmed the principle of infant baptism. With these credentials he was proposed, examined, and appointed to officiate the Cure of St Albans in Hertfordshire early in 1645/6,W. Urwick, Nonconformity in Herts: Being Lectures upon the Nonconforming Worthies of St Albans (Hazell, Watson & Viney Ltd., London 1884), pp. 131-34. and his The Character of an Old English Puritane, or Non- Conformist appeared in 1646.For the text of this work, see The Reformed Reader website. The Baptist movement was very active in north-western Hertfordshire: Geree's Vindiciae Paedo-Baptismi and Vindiciae Vindiciarum (dedicated to the Mayor and Burgesses of St Albans) were directed against the arguments of his former fellow-student John Tombes (whom he calls his 'ancient friend'), and of Edward Harrison of Kensworth, who was effectively founder of the St Albans Baptists.W.T. Whitley, 'Edward Harrison of Petty France', The Baptist Quarterly VII no. 5, pp. 214-20; D.G. Turner, 'The Origins of St Albans Baptists', The Baptist Quarterly XXXVII no. 8, pp. 402-09. Their belief was that the sacrament of baptism should be accorded only to those of age and understanding to be able to confess their faith. A determined opponent of Episcopacy, in 1646 he also published A Case of Conscience Resolved, to prove that the King could consent to its abolition without breaking his Coronation Oath. In another tract he condemned the practise of Judicial astrology. He left St Albans in 1647, being appointed preacher at St Faith under St Paul's,Athenae Oxonienses, p. 64. a parish whose congregation (including many booksellers) met in a crypt within Old St Paul's Cathedral in London. His residence in February 1648 was in Ivy Lane, Paternoster Row. In London, as elsewhere, his sermons were largely attended by Puritans. He produced a fourth edition of William Fenner's The Spirituall Mans Directorie, with his own preface of recommendation, enlarged tables and notes for the illiterate.See full text, including Geree letter, at Google (open). His Case of Conscience had been answered, or 'sifted', by Edward Boughen, to whom he rejoined with The Sifter's sieve broken in 1648. In the same year he introduced the publication of a tract from Thomas Shepard, formerly of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, who had emigrated to Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1635 to continue his ministry there.Some select cases resolved : Specially, tending to the right ordering of the heart, that we may comfortably walk with God in our general and particular callings: &c.; In a letter to a pious friend in England.

At the request of 'a godly Parliament-man' he preached against the drinking of healths. A sermon preached by Geree in May 1648 On the Bloodiness of War, to persuade to peace, met with a response from certain 'left-eared orators' taking it as an aspersion upon the army, and was published in self-defence. He came into controversy with John Goodwin, declaring that the seclusion and imprisoning of certain Parliament-men by the army was defensible neither by reason nor religion, and was answered by Goodwin and Samuel Richardson. His advocacy of reform had steered a careful path away from rebellion: he died in February 1649, soon after the King's execution. It was reported by Richard Baxter that Geree was against the Parliament's war, and that 'he dyed at the news of the King's death.'R.

However, from late 1640 a ten-year hiatus in the Wonersh register suggests some interruption to Geree's ministry there: but in 1644 he established his orthodoxy as a reformed minister in his tract The Doctrine of the Antinomians Confuted (an answer to Tobias Crisp), and in April 1645 the parsonage and cure of the parish church of Trinity in Guildford was sequestrated to him on the ejectment of Thomas Wall as a scandalous minister.A.R.

The advowson was customarily in the lords of the manor of Abinger, which was reunited in the possession of Richard Evelyn of Wotton in 1622, the moiety which had belonged to Sir John Morgan being sold to Evelyn by Morgan's daughter.H.E. Malden, 'Parishes: Abinger', A History of the County of Surrey Vol. 3 (V.C.H., London 1911), pp. 129-134. (British History Online accessed 7 June 2016) George Evelyn (brother of John Evelyn the diarist) succeeded his father in 1641, having married a granddaughter of George Duncombe's.Will of Richard Evelyn (P.C.C. 1641): Evelyn calls Duncombe his 'brother-in-law' on that account. Duncombe died in 1647Will of George Duncombe of Albury Surrey (P.C.C. 1647). He and John Machell appointed each other as Executors, but both died in the same year. and Lady Elizabeth Aungier in 1650, in her will releasing Geree from whatever money he owed her, and giving ¬£5 each to him and to his son John.Will of Elizabeth Machell of Wonersh, Surrey (P.C.C. 1650). Under that sustained familial patronage, Geree held Abinger for the rest of his life. His son Joseph was baptized there in 1647. He was encouraged by Thomas Hussey Sr. of Shere, Surrey, and of London, citizen and Grocer.Will of Thomas Hussey of London (P.C.C. 1655). In an action reflecting the unusual times, at a vestry meeting in 1654 Geree assigned 35 square feet of land within Abinger church to Hussey, for him to build a pew beside the pulpit, on a 1000-year lease for peppercorn rent, by ensealed and witnessed deed.Malden, 'Notes: Abinger Registers,' pp. 108-09. Hussey was a grandson of Sir Thomas Wroth (1518-1573) and Mary Rich on his mother's side.J.J. Howard and J.L. Chester (eds), The Visitation of London Anno Domini 1632, 1633 and 1634, Vol I, Harleian Society XV (1880), p.407. Geree's last published work, The Golden Mean, advocating the more frequent administration of the Lord's Supper, appeared in 1656. In the following year two of his sons, John (of Abinger) and Stephen (a Silkman in Soper Lane, London), were under observation as suspected persons when they came from Calais to collect a man lately prisoner in the Upper Bench and returned to France with him.A.R. Bax, 'Suspected persons in Surrey,' Surrey Archaeological Collections XIV (1899), pp. 164-89, at pp. 185-86. On 26 September 1660 Geree conducted the marriage of Mr Francis Hamond to his daughter Elizabeth Geree. This occasion was chosen by E.M. Forster to exemplify the age of John Evelyn, in the fourth episode of the 1934 Abinger Pageant.Sunil Kumar Sarker, A Companion to E.M. Forster, Vol 1, (Atlantic Publishers and Distributors, 2007), pp. 112-13. In 1662 Geree conformed. On 28 January 1664/5 his wife's burial took place, and on 9 February he followed her to the churchyard. John Geree, probably his son, was licensed as curate of Shalford in February 1667/8, instituted as Vicar of Farnham in 1669 and as Rector of East Clandon in March 1675/6.CCEd, Person ID: 93192.

Other than being an Internet provider, Iskon provides fixed line telephone and IPTV access, thus offering full triple play service. In 2006 Iskon was bought by T-HT and became part of Deutsche Telekom group, but retained its own company structure and brand image.  History  Iskon was founded in ƒåakovec in 1997 in home of Damir Sabol. Around the end of 1999, American company Adriatic Net Investors invested considerable funds in Iskon, changing the ownership structure of the company and moving its headquarters to Zagreb. In 2000, Iskon was additionally consolidated through foreign investment from Dresdener Kleinwort Benson Private Equity. In 2001, Iskon acquired Klik Multimedia company and launched its own web portal, which soon became the most visited portal in Croatian webspace. In May 2006, Iskon was bought by T-HT (which itself is part of Deutsche Telekom). Iskon's web portal (renamed net.hr) was singled out as an independent company before the purchase and thus avoided the takeover. The acquisition proved successful, since Iskon continued to function independently as a company providing broadband services under its own brand, transforming from a small family business into a company with more than 160 full-time employees.  Services and availability  Iskon is available though its own ULL infrastructure in following Croatian cities: Zagreb, Split, Dubrovnik, Rijeka, Pula, Osijek, Velika Gorica, Samobor, Opatija and Solin. It is also available in the rest of Croatia via T-com's infrastructure (bitstream). Other than being a broadband Internet provider, Iskon also offers IPTV and fixed-line telephony, both for private and business clients (with special emphasis towards SMESuperbrands, p. 235). In 2011, Iskon was the first company in Croatia to offer its customers a service to watch live TV on their mobile devices. In collaboration with CARNet (Croatian Academic and Research Network), Iskon offers discounted prices for its services to all Croatian pupils, students and faculty members.  Sponsorships  Since 2001. Iskon is a sponsor and official Internet provider of Croatian Football Federation. It also sponsors Croatian table tennis club Mladost Iskon, ATP Zagreb Indoors and Zagreb Open tennis tournaments, and Motovun Film Festival. References Bibliography *Superbrands, Zagreb, 2010.

A version of the song was officially released on 27 December 2011. Development In December 2011, Silambarasan revealed that he had recorded a promotional song promoting world peace, written in 96 different languages. Sony Music bought the rights of the song and launched a teaser version on 23 December 2011, with the actor revealing it was a \\"Christmas message to global fans\\". The song composed by Silambarasan himself, featured Drums Sivamani on percussions, Dharan Kumar as a keyboardist and Ramji Soma as a sound editor. The 2 minute 40 second song teaser gained positive reviews and became popular on social networking sites. Silambarasan announced that a final version would be released thereafter and announced his desire to bring in international artists Akon and Rihanna for the venture. He subsequently headed to Los Angeles in January 2012 and recorded an original version of the song by himself at Frank Zappa's Studio with music producer Elan Morrison. The failure to rope in the international artists prompted the project's producer, Silambarasan's father T. Rajender to lodge a police complaint against two agents who had misled his production company into supposed connections with the international artists concerned. Rajendar noted that the sound editor Ramji Soma and a Canadian entrepreneur Talvinder Bathh had charged Rs 1.2 crore () from his company and failed to return it despite promises made to sign on Akon, David Guetta and either Rihanna or Nicole Scherzinger for the project. In May 2013, Silambarasan was finally successfully able to bring in American hip-hop artist Akon to collaborate for an alternate version of the song, with the move being facilitated by Vameedharan of Tracktical Entertainment. Akon flew into Chennai for a two-day stay, where he recorded the song and also shot for the music video directed by Vignesh Shivan at Binny Mills. Silambarasan noted that this version would be more about \\"oneness and the need to spread love\\" and that the proposed filming with Akon had initially been long-delayed as a result of conflicting schedules. The latest version of the song is yet to be released, with Silambarasan hinting in early 2014 that the song may be launched before the end of 2014. In an interview in June 2015, he revealed that the venture would be resumed soon, though that he was busy with other commitments. In June 2016, in an interaction through Periscope, Silambarasan revealed that he was still waiting for a female singer to collaborate with for the song and that he would only release the song thereafter those portions were recorded. Music video The music video from December 2011 features the actor-playback singer Silambarasan singing the song and a linguist helping him with lyrics. The video was directed by Vignesh Shivan, with still photographs by Karthik Srinivasan and costumes designed by Vasuki Bhaskar. Legacy The film Pyaar Prema Kaadhal takes it title from the lyrics of the chorus from the song. Produced by Yuvan Shankar Raja and starring Harish Kalyan alongside Raiza Wilson, the film began production during November 2017.https://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movies-cinema- news-16/harish-kalyan-and-raizas-film-titled-pyaar-prema-kaadhal.html References  External links  * (posted by Sony Music India) 2011 songs Indian songs Tamil-language songs Viral videos Multilingual songs ","title":"The Love Anthem"},{"id":"34267581","text":"Luk√°≈° Dlouh√Ω and Paul Hanley were the defending champions but decided not to participate.

The Provisional Government was established under the Social Democratic government; however, the Bolsheviks refused to accept the government and revolted in October 1917, taking control of Russia. Vladimir Lenin, their leader, rose to power and governed between 1917 and 1924. The Bolsheviks formed the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, or the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, marking the beginning of the Russian Civil War between the revolutionary Reds and the counter-revolutionary Whites. In 1922, the Communist Reds were victorious and formed the Soviet Union, making Russia communist. Lenin died in 1924, starting a power struggle which ended with Joseph Stalin seizing power. He was the leader of the Communist Party until 1953. He encouraged political paranoia and conducted the Great Purge to remove opponents of his dominance. Stalin died in 1953, and the Soviet Union went through \\"De-Stalinisation\\" under the new leader Nikita Khrushchev, though his attempts to improve the lives of ordinary citizens were often ineffective. Khrushchev ruled through the years of the Cold War. Leonid Brezhnev was appointed leader in 1964. Brezhnev governed the era without economic reforms, which led to a national economic decline by the mid-1970s. Yuri Andropov gained power in 1982 and tried to improve the economy by increasing management effectiveness but without making changes to the principles of a socialist economy. Andropov later died in 1984, fifteen months after gaining power. Konstantin Chernenko led the Soviet Union from 1984 until his death thirteen months later in 1985. Chernenko was unable to consolidate power and effective control of the Communist party. Chernenko did little to prevent the escalation of the cold war with the United States and Western Europe. Mikhail Gorbachev became the last leader of the Soviet Union in 1985 and led until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Gorbachev improved relations and trade with the West and reduced the Cold War tensions. He implemented Glasnost, which meant that Soviet people had freedom they never previously had; this included greater freedom of speech. Control of the press was relaxed and thousands of political prisoners and dissidents were released. Gorbachev removed the constitutional role of the Communist party. This led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991. Russian Revolution February Revolution The First World War placed an unbearable strain on Russia's weak government and economy, resulting in mass shortages and hunger. In the meantime, the mismanagement and failures of the war turned the people and importantly, the soldiers against the Tsar, whose decision to take personal command of the army seemed to make him personally responsible for the defeats. In February 1917, the Tsar first lost control of the streets, then of the soldiers, and finally of the Duma, resulting in his forced abdication on 2 March 1917 On 25 February 1917, citywide strikes spread throughout Petrograd. Dozens of demonstrators were killed by troops. The crowds grew hostile, so the soldiers had to decide which side they were on. As the situation became critical, soldiers refused to work for the Tsar. On 26 February 1917, The Army abandoned the Tsar; the soldiers mutinied and refused to put down the riots. By 27 February 1917, the workers were in control of the entire city. October Revolution On 24‚Äì25 October 1917, the Bolsheviks and Left Socialist Revolutionaries organized a revolution, occupying government buildings, telegraph stations, and other strategic points. On 24 October 1917, the Red Guards took over bridges and telephone exchanges. On 25 and 26 October 1917, the Red Guards took over banks, government buildings, and railways stations. The cruiser Aurora fired blank shots at the Winter Palace signalling the start of the revolution. That night (9:40 PM), the Red Guards took over the Winter Palace and arrested the Provisional Government. On 27 October 1917, Lenin proclaimed that all power now belonged to the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies.  Civil War  After Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin took over the Soviet Union, many people still opposed the communist party. This led to the civil war between the White Army and Red Army. The White Army included the opposition party, while the Red Army were the people that supported Vladimir Lenin. This led to a number of dead around 10‚Äì30 million.  Collapse of the Soviet Union  In 1991, Mikhail Gorbachev voted the country out. He realized that the once communist country was now over half being democratic than a communist state, which resulted in the collapse. Boris Yeltsin then became the first president of Russia.

It was part of SAGEM, a major French company involved in defence electronics, consumer electronics and communication systems. In 2005, SAGEM and SNECMA merged to form SAFRAN. In 2008, the SAGEM group spun off its communications and mobile telephony businesses (known simply as: Sagem Mobiles) to focus on its core business. The broadband business was called: SAGEM Communication. The mobile phone business was called: SAGEM Wireless. Sagem Wireless was launched in January 2009 with investment from Sofinnova and Thierry Buffenoir became its CEO. As an independent company, Sagem Wireless undertook a shift in strategy away from the traditional ODM space of operator- branded low-range handsets and towards the design, development and delivery of customised mid and high-range mobile devices for global lifestyle brands and mobile operators. In the spring of 2011 Sagem Wireless was renamed Mobiwire SA and was bankrupt soon after. On 22 July 2011, following recovery proceedings, Sagetel Mobiles made an equity investment and a partial assets transfer relying on the support of the employees and management. The new company was named MobiWire SAS.

He was a member of the New York State Senate (6th D.) from 1832 to 1834, sitting in the 55th, 56th and 57th New York State Legislatures. He resigned his seat on June 5, 1834. In 1837, he removed to Houston, then the capital of the independent Republic of Texas, and resumed the practice of law there. The same year, he was appointed Attorney General of the Republic of Texas. In November 1838, he was appointed by President Sam Houston as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Texas, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of James Collinsworth, but the Texas Congress did not confirm the appointment, and instead elected Thomas Jefferson Rusk a few days after Houston left the presidency. Afterwards he resumed the practice of law in partnership with Houston, but died a few months later in Houston at the age of 37 and was buried at the city's Glendale Cemetery. Neither Collinsworth nor Birdsall ever convened the Supreme Court, the first session was held in January 1840, six months after Birdsall's death, with Rusk as Chief Justice.

He was known for his communist sympathies, and for spearheading the union movement between Syria and Egypt in 1958. Career After graduating from the Military Academy of Damascus, in 1935, Afif al-Bizri pursued advanced military training in France. His time there is credited with exposure to communism, where he met several French communists. He never officially joined the Syrian Communist Party, but was said to hold \\"radical Marxist views\\". In 1941, he left to Iraq and joined Rashid Ali al-Gaylani's revolt against the British. He returned to Syria after Gaylani's revolt was suppressed by the British. He served in the French-created \\"Troupe Speciale,\\" but deserted his post to join the Syrian rebels in 1945, which led to his arrest and deportation to Lebanon by the French authorities. After Syria's independence in 1946, Bizri resumed his military career as an instructor of topography at the Homs Military Academy. He fought as a volunteer in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, and was appointed by then-Chief of Staff of the Syrian Army, Husni al-Zaim, to the delegation that negotiated the Syrian-Israeli armistice agreement of 1949. Pan-Arabism by Gamal Abdal Nasser Al-Bizri shaking hands with Gamal Abdel Nasser as part of the Syrian delegation seeking unity with Egypt, January 1958 Starting in the mid-1950s, Bizri was advocating a socialist ideology in the army. After Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser allied himself with the Soviet Union, Bizri joined his Arab nationalism movement, and was later appointed by President Shukri al-Quwatli, as chief of staff of the Syrian Army, as an appeasement to Nasser. His term was characterized with the spread of Pan- Arabism in the Syrian Army ranks. Many of the officers who were promoted under him were loyal to Nasser. He also clashed with anti-Nasser politicians including Minister of Defense Khalid al-Azm and Prime Minister Sabri al- Assali, whom was forced to follow a pro-Nasser policy under threat of arrest. In 1957, he led a military tribunal into what came to be known as the \\"Iraqi Conspiracy.\\" The tribunal accused many anti-Nasser politicians with receiving illicit funds from anti-Nasser Arab governments including Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon, as well as plotting the assassination of Nasserist and Socialist leaders including Abdel Hamid al-Sarraj, Akram al-Hawrani, Khalid Bakdash, and Afif al-Bizri. The tribunal handed down death sentences to twelve politicians including members of the parliament, Adnan al-Atassi and Mikhail Ilyan. The sentences were commuted after the intervention of Arab governments, Great Britain, and President Quwatly. Bizri led the officer delegation that pleaded with Nasser for a full union between Syria and Egypt in 1958. He personally participated in the talks that eventually led to the establishment of the United Arab Republic on February 1, 1958. However, Bizri fell out with Nasser soon after the union because Nasser appointed his friend Egyptian General Abdel Hakim Amer as governor of Syria. Nasser distrusted Bizri's communist leanings, and eventually dismissed him from office in June 1959, and outlawed the communist party soon after. Bizri supported the 1961 coup that brought down the UAR. He returned to Syria from his exile, but was refused a post in the army due to his history.

Later historians have attempted to discover which king issued the decree, with general consensus deciding on King Henry I of England. The historian Pauline Stafford has related this decree to Henry's attempts to have his daughter Matilda succeed him on the throne of England, and sees this charter as recording this important step taken by the king towards that goal. A further unusual feature of this charter is that it mentions the negotiations that took place prior to the issuing of the charter, in this case, where Theobald of Bec persuaded Roger to be more generous than he had originally intended with the grant.Hudson Land, Law, and Lordship p. 158 Roger died around 1141 or 1142. His heir to his lands was first his eldest son Peter, who died without children in 1158.Keats-Rohan Domesday Descendants p. 758 The lands then passed to Roger's second son Robert.

In the game, players must shift around puzzle blocks in order to create steps and platforms, ultimately to reach children who have been trapped within the giant structures. A sequel, Crashmo (known as Fallblox in Europe and Australia), was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2012. A third game, Pushmo World (known in Europe and Australia as Pullblox World and in Japan as Hikuosu World), was released for Wii U on June 19, 2014. A fourth game, Stretchmo (known in Europe and Australia as Fullblox and in Japan as Hikudasu Hippaland), was released for Nintendo 3DS in May 2015. Gameplay In the game, a Pushmo is a large, climbable playground structure made of blocks that can slide forwards and backwards. The player controls Mallo, a red, round sumo wrestling creature visiting Pushmo Park, home to dozens of Pushmo. While speaking with Papa Blox, the park's caretaker and the creator of the Pushmo, Mallo learns that a number of children have become trapped within the Pushmo structures. In order to rescue the children, Mallo must move the sliding blocks of the Pushmo in such a way to create a path to reach the child. Mallo can push and pull blocks a maximum of three steps forward, and can only do so while standing in front of the block or by standing to the side, provided Mallo has a platform on which to step while moving. If Mallo becomes stuck, the player can either reset the Pushmo or use a rewind feature similar to games such as Braid and Catrap. Also, difficult levels can be skipped and re- visited later, if desired. Later levels add manholes that allow Mallo to travel within the Pushmo to reach other parts of the structure. Along with the game's included 250-plus levels, Pushmo also includes the Pushmo Studio, where players can create and share their own Pushmo puzzles. In order to share puzzles, Pushmo generates a QR code that can be read by the 3DS' on-board cameras; the QR images can be posted on the Internet, printed or photographed from the 3DS's screen. Reception Pushmo has received critical acclaim, particularly for its presentation and originality. Lucas Thomas of IGN called the game \\"a beautifully original, absolutely charming and oftentimes devious little portable puzzler\\", \\"the 3DS eShop's killer app\\" and \\"this may very well be the best downloadable game Nintendo's ever offered in any format\\". Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com said Pushmo was \\"one of the 3DS's most outstanding offerings to date\\". Patrick Barnett of Nintendo World Report said the game was \\"an ingenious puzzler that will consume the free time of anyone who gives it a whirl\\". Sequels A sequel to Pushmo called Crashmo (Fallblox in the PAL region) was announced on October 4, 2012 by Nintendo in both North America and Europe. It was released in Japan on October 31, 2012, November 22, 2012 for the North American Nintendo eShop and November 15, 2012 for the European and Australian eShop. Using Mallo, players save birds rather than children and Mallo will be able to take on 140 new levels by pulling the blocks in any direction, causing some to fall. A third game, Pushmo World, known in Europe and Australia as Pullblox World and in Japan as Hikuosu World, has been released for the Wii U in Japan, North America, Europe and Australia on June 19, 2014. A fourth game, Stretchmo, was released for the 3DS in Japan on May 12, 2015, and in Europe, Australia, and North America on May 14, 2015.

He was trying to build support for an English Protestant takeover of Scotland and collected names of potential supporters. In his report, Ninian lamented that these supporters were motivated for gain from England rather than by the \\"Word of God.\\"Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), pp. 34-35: Marcus Merriman, 'The Assured Scots: Scottish Collaborators with England during the Rough Wooing', Scottish Historical Reveiew, vol. 47 no. 143 (April 1968), pp. 16 fn, 18 fn, 23, 26. Andrew Dudley hoped to distribute English bibles in Dundee from his base at Broughty.CSP Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 35. His brother John Cockburn was declared a traitor on 29 February 1548. Regent Arran had captured the House of Ormiston and the Privy Council ordered its demolition.HMC 11th Report part vi, Manuscripts of the Duke of Hamilton (London, 1887), p. 39. Ninian wrote to Protector Somerset on 16 March, repeating some older news from a letter of 20 February which does not survive. He had been to Mary of Guise with a message from Somerset but her answer was not satisfactory, and she had managed to make him the enemy of Regent Arran, his half-brother John Hamilton, Bishop of Dunkeld, and George Douglas of Pittendreich. Ninian thought he would have to stay near English-held Haddington or Broughty Castle. Arran was going to harvest Ormiston wood as a punishment, and was taking timber and stones from the house of Alexander Crichton of Brunstane for the new Spur blockhouse at Edinburgh Castle, (designed by Migliorino Ubaldini). Ninian had asked Andrew Dudley, the commander of Broughty, to write to Mary of Guise that he was well able to defeat any attack from French galleys.CSP Scotland, vol.1 (Edinburgh, 1898), pp. 97-98. In August, Ninian told Grey of Wilton the news that Mary, Queen of Scots, had sailed for France from Dumbarton Castle.CSP Scotland, vol.1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p .154 no. 306. In his History John Knox mentions that Ninian was involved in the trial of John Melville of Raith for treason. Knox, with some uncertainty, says Ninian discovered a compromising letter at the House of Ormiston. Raith's correspondence with his son in England was deemed treasonous. Raith was beheaded in December 1548.John Knox, History of the Reformation, Works, vol.1 (Edinburgh, 1846), pp. 224-5. At this time, Ninian was in favour with Mary of Guise, who was Regent Arran's rival for power in Scotland, and he told Andrew Dudley he hoped to bring her round to the English cause.CSP Scotland, vol.1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 56 no. 119. Officer of the Scots Guard Nicholas Throckmorton gave Ninian the codename \\"George Beaumont\\" The Scottish diplomat James Melville of Halhill recorded his meeting at St Germain en Laye with Ninian in 1553, now a Captain of Horse in the French king's guard. Mary of Guise was about to become Regent of Scotland in place of Regent Arran, and Ninian brought news from Scotland of the opinion of her political enemy John Hamilton, now Archbishop of St Andrews, who had been ill when Arran discussed relinquishing his powers to her. The Archbishop had recovered due to the care of the Italian physician Gerolamo Cardano. Melville was not pleased by Ninian's intervention and called him a \\"busy meddler.\\" Melville described how Ninian tried to use him as an interpreter in an interview with Anne de Montmorency, Constable of France, and pretended Melville was his nephew. Melville conveyed his reluctance to proceed to the Constable and he dismissed Ninian from his presence in his cabinet in the Ch√¢teau before the tale was told.Thomson, Thomas, Memoirs of his own life (Bannatyne Club, Edinburgh, 1827), p. 22. In December 1553, Montmorency received a very similar report of Arran and the Archbishop's intentions to retain Edinburgh Castle and Dumbarton Castle, sent by the ambassador, Antoine de Noailles, who had heard it from a banished Scotsmen in London.Abb√© de Vertot, Ambassades de Messieurs de Noailles en Angleterre, vol.2 (Leyden, 1763), pp. 346-7. In May 1557 Mary, Queen of Scots wrote to her mother from the Ch√¢teau of Villers-Cotter√™ts on behalf of \\"le Cappitaine Cokborne.\\" Ninian urgently needed to return to Scotland to conclude a property transaction with Alexander Aitchison and John Sinclair. The lands concerned at \\"Gosfenot\\" had been occupied by French forces during the war with England. However, as Ninian was fully occupied in the king's service, Mary hoped the Queen Regent would settle the matter. (\\"Gosfenot\\" was perhaps near Gosford House at Longniddry).Maidment, James Analecta Scotica (Edinburgh, 1834) p. 38: A. Labanoff, Lettres de Marie Stuart, vol.1, pp. 38-39. During the crisis of the Scottish Reformation, Ninian's brother John, laird of Ormiston was involved in a major setback for the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Ormiston carried ¬£1,000 or 6,000 crowns from England to aid their fight against French troops in Scotland on 31 October 1559. The Earl of Bothwell ambushed him and after a sword fight captured the money. This caused diplomatic embarrassment as the English were caught out aiding Mary of Guise's rebels.CSP Scotland, vol.1 (Edinburgh, 1898), pp. 258-259, 262. The English ambassador in Paris Nicholas Throckmorton considered sending Ninian to spy on the French at the siege of Leith in May 1560. Throckmorton described Ninian‚Äôs rewards as an officer of the Scots Guard. He was a gentleman archer with a salary of 800 Francs, and was lord of the manor of Themis (or Captain of Feismes Castle) with an income of another 800 Francs. As an officer of the Guard, he commanded a company of 100 horsemen. Usefully, Ninian‚Äôs wife, Elizabeth Kemp, was an attendant in the Privy Chamber of Mary, Queen of Scots in France. Throckmorton wanted Ninian to assume the name \\"Beaumont,\\" and thereafter he continued to sign his letters to William Cecil as \\"George Beaumont.\\"CSP Foreign Elizabeth, vol. 8 (London, 1871), no. 715.For the income of Themis/Feismes, see Biblioth√®que Nationale de France gallica on-line catalogue, Fran√ßais 4588, item 59; Continuation d'un don d'une terre, au profit de \\"Greignau Colburn, gentilhomme escossois, cappitaine du chasteau de Feismes,\\" auquel le roi HENRI II avait fait don, pour neuf ans, √† partir du 1 janvier 1557, \\"de tout le revenu, proffit et esmolument de [ladite] terre et seigneurie de Feismes, ses appartenances et deppendances, ainsy qu'elle se poursuit et comporte, scitu√©e et assize au village de Vitry.\\" On 22 and 23 June 1560, Ninian (as Beaumont) met Thomas Gresham at Antwerp. He told Gresham the French ambassador was planning on behalf of Francis II of France to write to James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran, who had been commander of the Scot's Guard. Arran would be offered the Crown of Scotland and the withdrawal of French troops if he abandoned the plan for him to marry Elizabeth I of EnglandCSP Foreign Elizabeth, vol. 3 (London, 1865) p. 9, & nos 224, 236, 263. Servant of Mary Queen of Scots Mary Queen of Scots made Ninian chamberlain and factor of the Priory of Sciennes. His wife Elizabeth Kemp joined the queen's household in Scotland and she received Ninian's royal pension of ¬£225 per year. Thomas Randolph gave Elizabeth a letter from Ninian to give to Mary. Ninian's letter had news of the French wars of religion that made the queen weep. Later, Randolph wrote that his report of the siege of Orl√©ans had not \\"discomforted\\" her, but Ninian's plain speaking would do him little good in Scotland. Elizabeth died in 1565, they had a son Francis Cockburn.Accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland, vol.11 (Edinburgh, 1916), p.55, 221, 363: CSP Scotland, vol.1 (Edinburgh, 1898), 676, 688. Ninian continued in France in the Scots Guard, and sent William Cecil inaccurate reports of French subsidies given to Scotland.John Hungerford Pollen, Papal Negotiations of Mary Queen of Scots, p. 423 & footnote: CSP Foreign Elizabeth, vol.8 (London, 1871) no. 701. Hugh Fitzwilliam met him in Paris in September 1566, and wrote to Cecil that Ninian was friendly and helpful but his information was unreliable.CSP Foreign Elizabeth, vol.8 (1871), no.733 Ninian came to Scotland to the court of Mary in September 1565. He travelled through England, and at Berwick upon Tweed he met the Earl of Bedford who wrote that Ninian was \\"the same old man and had not changed his vein.\\" Ninian reported to Cecil that he spoke to Mary discussing the political roles of the Earl of Lennox and the Earl of Bothwell, reminding her of the difficulties her father experienced banishing the Earl of Angus and George Douglas in 1529. He returned to France and was joined by his nephew, Christopher Cockburn, in November.CSP Foreign Elizabeth, vol. 7 (London, 1870) pp. 467-8, 477, 510. George Buchanan wrote that Ninian was in Scotland in 1567. Ninian raced back to the French court in June 1567 with news of Mary's capture at the battle of Carberry Hill. On the way he overtook her ambassador, William Chisholm, Bishop of Dunblane, who was ignorant of Mary's defeat, and upstaged him in front of Charles IX of France and Catherine de Medici.Aikman, James, trans., History of Scotland by George Buchanan, vol. 2 (Glasgow, 1827), p. 523. Working for the Regents of Scotland Ninian was mostly stationed in Dieppe, though Catherine de Medici kept him at court in January 1568. In April 1568 his fellow archers wrote they wished he had been fighting alongside them at battle of Saint Denis. After Mary Queen of Scots went into exile in England, Ninian's correspondence with her half-brother Regent Moray, the English ambassador, and others was discovered in July 1568. He became a fugitive and lost all his offices and influence in France. The English ambassador, Henry Norris, reported that his house in Paris was raided just after he fled.CSP Foreign Elizabeth, vol. 8 (1871), nos. 2118, 2395. Another agent, Master James Gordon was keen to step in his place.CSP Scotland, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), p. 454. Ninian returned to Scotland, and in October 1568 he travelled to York with Regent Moray for the conference discussing Mary's alleged crimes and the Casket letters.CSP Foreign Elizabeth, vol .8 (London, 1871), nos. 1982, 2552. In Scotland, Ninian received payments from the Regents who ruled on behalf of James VI of Scotland. In August 1572 George Buchanan mentioned the Captain in a letter to Thomas Randolph. Buchanan was joking about the news of Randolph's marriage, and said he preferred in this case Captain Cockburn's \\"shrewd Scottish wit\\" to Randolph's \\"English Solomoniacal sapience\\", Randolph being sick in the head whilst Cockburn was infirm in the feet.Ellis, Henry, ed., Original Letters Illustrative of British History, series 3 vol. 4 (London, 1846), p. 374. Ninian was sent to London on royal business carrying letters in July 1573.Accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1970), pp. 160, 325, 350, 356-7, 375. He was proud that he could still ride post-haste. At York the Lord President of the North looked at the date of the letters he carried from London and asked his age and marvelled. He reached Newcastle in a day and Berwick the next.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1571-1574, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1905), p. 601. Regent Morton wrote to the Countess of Lennox on 19 August 1573. He had asked for her help to recover the jewels of Mary, Queen of Scots. He sent the letter with his \\"good friend\\" Ninian Cockburn, who had delivered some of the queen's jewels to Sir Valentine Browne.CSP Scotland, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1905), p. 604. Cockburn served at Morton's justice ayre at Peebles in 1574. He corresponded with the Earl of Leicester, who discussed his letters with Francis Walsingham. (Ninian warned of someone coming to Scotland from France, (possibly Esm√© Stewart who arrived five years later). Morton sent Ninian to Berwick with letters in July 1575 but he broke his leg and was laid up at Coldingham. Morton sent the surgeon Gilbert Primrose to care for him.Accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 13 (Edinburgh, 1978), pp. 17, 69, 73. Ninian recovered and went to the French court and England in August 1576. For this journey, Morton requested a passport for the \\"old gentlemen\\" from Cecil. Again in 1578, Ninian went to Cecil with a message from Morton, and Morton wrote that Ninian was Cecil's \\"old acquaintance, not minded yet to settle himself for any age, but to visit the world after his accustomed manner.\\"HMC Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield House, vol. 2 (London, 1888), p. 183.

Initially active in the 1980s, Signal Aout 42 became known for producing music in the EBM and industrial styles of electronic music, but into and through the 1990s also incorporated techno, acid, and trance styles. After a decade-long hiatus, the band became active again in the late 2000s.  Background  Jacky Meurisse at the Wave-Gotik-Treffen in 2016 Signal Aout 42 (at the time known simply called SIGNAL) formed in 1981 as the project of a bunch of schoolmates (Jacky Meurisse, Damien and Luc Vandamme) who decided to get on stage to have fun and play improvised gigs. In fact they didn‚Äôt have proper compositions but they were more like audio and visual performances (industrial noises, chainsaw, metal barrels‚Ä¶played to rhythms generated by drum machines and synthetic sound atmospheres, the whole thing being made in a DIY style, tinkering around with homemade or borrowed instruments. Due to many jokes about the name Signal (which was also the name of a famous brand of toothpaste), Signal changed its name to Signal Aout 42 (translated: Signal August '42), a reference to the date when the German Wehrmacht propaganda publication Signal was first released. A cover image from the debut issue was used on posters announcing their concerts. With his first salary in 1985, Jacky Meurisse bought a bit of equipment, including a Roland TB-303 Bass Line and a TR-606, which enabled them to write the first tracks worthy of the name: \\"Pleasure and Crime\\" and \\"Lovely Trees\\". They were released together as 12‚Ä≥ maxi single by Disco Smash, which became an underground club hit. The follow- up single was \\"Girls of Vlaanderen\\", a nod to his wife who is of Flemish origin. The success of these releases led to recording of an album, Pro patria. It remains a cult record in the mind of alternative electronic music fans. In 1988 Meurisse became a professional musician and invested in a recording studio located on 22 rue du Fort in Comines. It was here that he composed the smash hit \\"Le Dormeur\\" for one of his more chart-oriented side projects, Pleasure Game, as well as the 12‚Ä≥ singles \\"Submarine Dance\\", \\"To Talk Nonsense\\", \\"The Right Thing\\", and \\"Carnaval\\", which all became EBM New Beat classic tunes. A second album, Contrast, was released in 1990. At that time Signal Aout 42 was made up of Jacky Meurisse; Damien Vandamme, who gave constructive ideas and who was in charge of visuals for the band; Jean Luc Szekanecz, who took part in the writing of a couple of 12‚Ä≥ singles and a few gigs; and Luc Vandamme, who performed live percussion. The compilation album Immortal Collection 1983-1995 was released in 1995 by Out of Line Music. From 1990 to 1995, Jacky Meurisse relocated the studio. He worked exclusively for Disco Smash-Blackout Records and wrote several successful tracks for side projects like Pleasure Game (\\"Le Dormeur\\"), Le Park (\\"Naked\\"), DJPC, Amnesia (\\"It's A Dream\\"), and BORIS while keeping his passion for SA42 and After the third album, Conviction, there was a hiatus of more than ten years before the release of a fourth album, Transformation, in 2007.

During his lifetime Sumitro held several prominent roles including the Dean of the Faculty of Economics at the University of Indonesia.  Early life  Sumitro was born in Kebumen, Central Java, on May 29, 1917, the eldest son in an aristocratic Javanese family. Sumitro was the son of Margono Djojohadikusumo, the founder of Bank Negara Indonesia and the first head of the Temporary Grand Advisory Council (Dewan Pertimbangan Agung Sementara, DPAS) and member of the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence (Badan Penyelidik Usaha Persiapan Kemerdekaan, or BPUPK). He spent his childhood in Java before moving to Europe, where he received his academic training, first at the prestigious Sorbonne University in Paris and later at Economische Hogeschool (the College of Economics) in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. He first won recognition as an economist at the age of 29, serving as an adviser to the Dutch delegation attending the United Nations Security Council meeting in London in 1946. Personal life Sumitro married Dora Marie Sigar, born in Manado in North Sulawesi 1921, on 7 January 1946 in Jakarta.Family details are from Sumitro Djojohadikusumo, Jejak Perlawanan Begawan Pejuang [Footsteps in the Resistance of a Freedom Fighter], Jakarta: Sinar Harapan, 2000, pp. 439 and 440. They had 4 children: * Biantiningsih Miderawati Djiwandono (n√©e Djojohadikusumo; born 1948) * Maryani Ekowati Djojohadikousumo Lemaistre (born 1950), * Prabowo Subianto Djojohadikusumo (born 1951), and * Hashim Sujono Djojohadikusumo (born 1954).

His wife, Dora, outlived him, dying in Singapore on 23 December 2008.  Government and political career  In March 1946 Sumitro returned to the newly independent Indonesia. He served in a series of successive governments, starting as an assistant to prime minister Sutan Sjahrir. In 1948 he was the deputy chief delegate representing Indonesia at the UN Security Council meeting at Lake Success, New York. Following Indonesia's international recognition in December 1949, Sumitro became charg√© d'affaires at the Indonesian Embassy in Washington D.C., before becoming one of five experts assisting the UN secretary- general.\\"Sumitro dies at 84 of heart failure\\", The Jakarta Post, March 10, 2001, archived on May 20, 2014. Sumitro went on to serve as the a Cabinet Minister for both Sukarno and Suharto. During the late 1950s Sumitro involved in the PRRI/Permesta rebellion during which disgruntled leaders in several provinces in Sumatra and Sulawesi declared secession from the central government in Jakarta. The movement was quickly crushed and Sumitro fled abroad.

Contributions to Indonesian higher education Sumitro played a prominent role in the Faculty of Economics at the University of Indonesia (FEUI). Following Independence, Sumitro was the only Indonesian with a doctorate in economics. He invited foreign lecturers from the Netherlands and lecturers from other faculties to assist in educating the students in the FEUI. As tensions grew and Dutch professors were pushed out of their roles in the university, Sumitro recognized the need for more Indonesian economists. He asked the Ford Foundation to help support teaching in the Economics Faculty by sending a group of promising Indonesian students to the University of California, Berkeley to study economics. This group of students, who later became known as the Berkeley Mafia, returned to Indonesia to serve in several high profile government positions and are credited as the architects of the modern Indonesian economy. The group included Widjojo Nitisastro, Mohammad Sadli, Emil Salim, Subroto, and Ali Wardhana.

The building is a two storied structure, with a tall clock tower over the entrance gate. The mosque has intricate designs and texts from Quran engraved on the wall. The interior of the mosque is decorated with marbles, candles and hanging lanterns. Imambara Courtyard  Clock  Hooghly Imambara is famous for its vaunted clock. It is at the middle of the twin towers constructed on the doorway of the main entrance. Each tower, having a height of approximately 150 ft., takes 152 steps to reach its top. The clock has two dials with three bells having weight 80 mds, 40 mds and 30 mds. Smaller bells ring at an interval of 15 minutes and bigger bell rings to signify one hour. The clock requires two people to wind it for half an hour of each week, with a key weighing 20 kg. It was bought for Rs. 11,721 (in 1852) by Syed Keramat Ali from the manufacturer: M/s Black & Hurray Co., Big Ben, London. Location It is in Hooghly District. People coming from Kolkata have to take a train (Local or Express) to Naihati Junction. From Naihati, they have to catch the Bandel Local train and they get off at Hooghly Ghat Station. From there, Imambara is in a walking distance. There are rickshaws and autos to ferry visitors to the Imambara from the station. Or, the best way to come possibly is to go to Howrah Station and avail the straight trains (local EMUs) to Bandel, which are more frequent and less crowded. One needs to get down at Hooghly Station, and take autos/totos/rickshaws to the Imambara. Visitors should carry their own lunch/snacks, since there are no eateries around the Imambara. Visitors are also advised to carry potable/drinking water.

The Literary Encyclopedia. First published 16 August 2004 accessed 15 May 2017 published in 1981 by Allen Lane. It won the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize in 1983 and, following a period of ups and downs, was released as a film in 1993. Plot  Prentis, junior assistant in the 'dead crimes' department of the police archives in London, starts writing a personal memoir almost inadvertently. It is in response to his growing alienation from his wife and children; to regular visits to his estranged father, who has recently become catatonic and is in hospital; and to the confusing situation at work where he suspects his boss, Quinn, of suppressing crucial files in a case he is asked to investigate. Eventually it emerges that the files concern a friend that his father has betrayed and a blackmailer who claimed to have evidence that his father was not the World War 2 war-hero he claimed to be. Quinn is approaching retirement and has been grooming Prentis to see if he would make a suitably humane successor. Now he gives Prentis the choice of whether Quinn should destroy the files in question. When he agrees, he is guaranteed promotion. At the same time he loses his sense of inferiority to his father and manages to rescue his family situation at home. He has come to the conclusion that the impressions we make are fictitious. His father‚Äôs story of his work as a spy in Nazi-occupied France, passages from which are interspersed with Prentis‚Äô own narrative, was created to hide the real truth about himself. Prentis, in his turn, is now creating a new version of himself in order to conceal his own weakness and uncertainties.

He contributed to the theory of heavy particle radioactivity (Cluster decay).  Education  Poenaru completed his higher education at the Emanuil Gojdu National College in Oradea where in 1953 he received a diploma of merit. After passing the entrance examination, he studied at the Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunication of Politehnica University of Bucharest from which he graduated in 1958. In 1971, he received a B.A. in theoretical physics from the University of Bucharest while working in electronic engineering at the Institute of Atomic Physics (IFA) of the Romanian Academy in MƒÉgurele near Bucharest. He received his Ph.D. in Nuclear Electronics, from Politehnica University in 1968. He received a second Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics from the Central Institute of Physics Bucharest in 1980.  Academic career  1958‚Äì1962 Electronic engineer, Institute of Atomic Physics (IFA) of the Romanian Academy, MƒÉgurele near Bucharest. 1962‚Äì1969 Senior electronic engineer, IFA, MƒÉgurele. 1966‚Äì1968 Part-time, assistant professor, Faculty of Electronics, Politehnica University of Bucharest (Seminars on Radio-Electronics). 1969‚Äì1977 Senior researcher of 3rd degree, IFA MƒÉgurele. 1977‚Äì1990 Senior researcher of 3rd degree, Institute of Physics and Nuclear Engineering (IFIN - former IFA reorganized), MƒÉgurele. 1981‚Äì1986 Part-time, lecturer, Faculty of Physics, University of Bucharest (Nuclear structure and Nuclear Reactions). 1990‚Äì1996 Senior researcher of 1st degree, the highest position in research, equivalent with full professor at the University, IFIN, MƒÉgurele. 1996‚Äì2000 Scientific director of IFIN-HH ‚Äî the largest Romanian Institute of Research. Since 1996 Senior researcher of 1st degree, Horia Hulubei National Institute of Physics and Nuclear Engineering (IFIN-HH), the former IFIN reorganized. Also PhD supervisor (Associate Professor, Faculty of Physics, University of Bucharest), since 1990. On June 30, 2017 he was elected Honorary member of the Romanian Academy.  Scientific leadership  Poenaru organized the International Symposium \\"Advances in Nuclear Physics\\" celebrating the 50th anniversary of IFIN-HH, held in Bucharest in 1999 and the NATO Advanced Study Institute on \\"Nuclei far from Stability and Astrophysics\\", Predeal, 2000. He was named one of the most valued reviewers of 2010 by the Editors of Elsevier and Nuclear Physics Other journals for which Dr. Poenaru peer reviewed articles include Physical Review Letters, Physical Review C, Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics and Canadian Journal of Physics. He was a member of the Scientific Council of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Dubna, 1996‚Äì1997. He was project manager of the FP5 European Union Centre of Excellence IDRANAP (InterDisciplinary Research and Applications based on Nuclear and Atomic Physics), selected in 2000 by European Commission among 34 successful proposals out of 185 applications from 11 countries.  Scientific achievements  Poenaru designed and built about 15 electronic instruments, including a counting-rate meter with industrial applications, a closed-circuit television system used at the cyclotron, a charge-sensitive low-noise amplifier and a precision pulse generator for a semiconductor detector spectrometer and a switching circuit for photomultiplier tubes. He helped develop the theory of charge collection in semiconductor detectors and the formation of current or voltage pulses at the input of associated electronics. Poenaru produced experimental works on nuclear reactions (e.g., neutron evaporation spectra) and identification of new high-spin nuclear isomeric states. He experimented on fission isomers (e.g. excitation functions, excitation energies, isomeric yield, half-life measurements, angular correlations).D. N. Poenaru, Fission isomers. Experimental work, Annales de Physique (Paris), 2 (1977) 133-168. He created ASAF and Numerical SuperAsymmetric Fission (NuSAF) models used to show that alpha decay may be considered a cold fission process. He identified a new semi-empirical relationship (SemFIS) for half-life relative to alpha-decay based on fission theory, taking into account the shell effects.D. N. Poenaru, M. Ivascu, Estimation of the alpha-decay halflives, Journal de Physique (Paris) 44 (1983) 791-796. He published the most frequently-cited paper in the field of cluster decay in 1980.A. Sandulescu, D.N. Poenaru, W. Greiner, New type of decay of heavy nuclei intermediate between fission and alpha-decay. Soviet J. Part. Nucl. 11: 528‚Äì541. The next one was published in 1985.Poenaru, D. N., Ivascu, M., Sandulescu, A., and Greiner, W., Atomic nuclei decay modes by spontaneous emission of heavy ions, Physical Review C 32 (1985) 572-581. Radioactivity Starting in 1984, the following radioactivities were experimentally confirmed worldwide: 14C, 20O, 23F, 22,24-26Ne, 28,30Mg, and 32,34Si. The measured half- lives are in good agreement with theoretical predictions within the analytical superasymmetric fission (ASAF) model developed by Poenaru, W. Greiner, et al. Citations of papers published by D. N. Poenaru et al. on heavy particle radioactivities started in 1984 after the first experimental confirmation by Rose and Jones of the 14C radioactivity of 223Ra. The phenomenon of heavy reactivity received wide popularity. The event was described by scientific journals, including La Recherche Nr. 159, Oct. 1984 p. 1300; Science et Vie Nr. 808, Jan. 1985 p. 42; Physics Bulletin Vol. 46 Nr. 489, 1985 p. 489, Scientific American Nr. 3, March 1990 p. 58 (translated into 9 languages), Europhysics News Nr. 5, Nr. 5, September/October 1996, p. 99 and by newspapers in Germany, Hungary, and Romania. Many experimenters and theoreticians acknowledged D. N. Poenaru's contributions.W. Kutschera et al., Physical Review C 32 (1985) 2036.G. Shanmugam, Physical Review C 38 (1988) 1377; C 41 (1990) 1184.P. B. Price, Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science 35 (1989) 19-42.Pan Qiangyan et al., Physical Review C 62 (2000) 044612.D.N. Basu et al., Physics Letters B 566 (2003) 90.G. Ardisson, M. Hussonnois, Radiochimica Acta 70/71 (1995) 123. Poenaru continued to investigate actively the field. He published in many journals and books, gave invited talks at International Conferences and led international seminars. He and his coworkers published comprehensive tables of half-lives for cluster emission used by experimentalists and other theorist as a guide or a reference. His ASAF model provides a unified approach of cold fission, cluster decay and alpha decay. The systematics of experimental results updated in 2002 was useful to stress that the strong shell effect of the daughter nucleus 208Pb was not fully exploited, suggesting the need for new measurements.D. N. Poenaru, Y. Nagame, R. A. Gherghescu, W. Greiner, Systematics of cluster decay modes, Physical Review C 65 (2002) 054308; Erratum: C 66 (2002) 049902. In 2006, the barrier shape of some cluster decay modes were obtained by using the macroscopic- microscopic method. An alpha emitter (106Te) was discovered with a potential energy surface on which the alpha-decay valley may be seen by the same method. An extensive study of alpha decay of superheavy nuclei was performed during the last decade, as a consequence of identifying new elements of the \\"island of stability\\".D. N. Poenaru, I. H. Plonski, W. Greiner, Alpha-decay half-lives of superheavy nuclei Physical Review C 74 (2006) 014312. A new method to estimate the preformation probability as a penetrability of the internal part of the barrier within a fission theory was developed.D. N. Poenaru, W. Greiner, Rare Decay Modes by Cluster Emission from Nuclei, Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics, 17 (1991) S443-S451. The simplest way to represent the systematics of half-lives for alpha-decay and heavy particle radioactivity is offered by the universal curve (UNIV), log T = f(log P) - a single straight line for a given even-even cluster decay mode, published in 1990. T is the half-life and P is the penetrability. The three fission models (ASAF, UNIV, and SemFIS) have been also applied to study the decay modes of superheavy nuclei produced in heavy ion fusion reactions at GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research Darmstadt, Joint Institute for Nuclear Research Dubna, RIKEN Japan, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA. For atomic numbers Z > 122, it is possible that cluster decay may be stronger than (i.e. have a larger branching ratio than) alpha decay.Poenaru, D. N., Gherghescu, R. A., Greiner, W., Heavy particle radioactivities of superheavy nuclei, Phys. Rev. Lett. 107 (2011) 062503. He extended the binary fission theory to more complex phenomena such as ternary fission (particle-accompanied fission) and multicluster fission was predicted. Quaternary fission (two-alpha accompanied fission) was experimentally discovered by Goennenwein et al. Pyatkov and Kamanin et al. in JINR Dubna are pursuing experiments on collinear ternary fission. In 2005, when Alexandru Proca's death was commemorated, Poenaru used the opportunity to disseminate information about his relativistic equations of the massive vector boson field, as well as his life in Romania and in France. Since 2007, the macroscopic-microscopic method was used to study the equilibrium shapes of metallic atomic clusters. Within these multidisciplinary investigations the hemispheroidal quantum harmonic oscillator, a new deformed single-particle shell model, was developed. The large yield of single ionized trimer (with two delocalized electrons, the analogue of an alpha particle) observed in experiments on doubly ionized metallic clusters was explained. Unlike in fission of heavy nuclei, in this case both the liquid drop model deformation energy and the shell corrections versus the number of delocalized electrons of the light fragment reach a minimum at the well known magic number ne=2. It was suggested to use this type of fission mode in nanotechnology.  International collaboration  Since 1964 Poenaru collaborated with scientists from JINR Dubna, CRN Strasbourg, Institut de physique nucleaire d'Orsay, CENBG Bordeaux-Gradignan, Vanderbilt University (Nashville), Advanced Science Research Center of Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute Tokai, Institut fuer Theoretische Physik der J. W. Goethe Universitaet, Frankfurt am Main, GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research Darmstadt, and Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies. During 53 years of scientific activity he spent nearly 11 years abroad: 2 months in Ukraine; 3 months in Russia; 3 months in Japan; 4 months in USA; one year and 10 months in France, and 8 years in Germany.  Publications  He published more than 189 articles in refereed journals (152 ISI), 123 communications at international scientific meetings (54 invited talks, 30 oral contributions and 39 seminar talks). The first two conferences at which cluster decay modes were discussed were Varna in 1985 and Kyoto 1988. He was coauthor or co-editor of 12 books; five in Romania and seven in USA, Germany, England, the Netherlands and Singapore. * Nuclei far from stability and astrophysics, Eds. D. N. Poenaru, H.

Greiner in the New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica for calculations, published in 1980, indicating the possibility of a new type of decay of nuclei: heavy particle radioactivity. In this way he became the 4th Romanian scientist mentioned in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, after Nicolae Paulescu, Henri CoandƒÉ, and Aureliu Sandulescu. In 1980 Sandulescu, Poenaru, and Greiner described calculations indicating the possibility of a new type of decay of heavy nuclei intermediate between alpha decay and spontaneous fission. The first observation of heavy-ion radioactivity was that of a 30-MeV, carbon-14 emission from radium-223 by H.J. Rose and G.A. Jones in 1984.

For more than two decades the facility played an important role in the teaching of party doctrine to the organization's functionaries, as well as offering a more general educational program to trade union activists. The Workers School was a model for local CPUSA training centers in the area (e.g., the Jewish Workers University, founded in New York City in 1926. ) and in other American cities (e.g., the Chicago Workers School. ) It also provided the direct inspiration for the New Workers School, established by the breakaway Communist Party (Majority Group) headed by Jay Lovestone and Benjamin Gitlow (supported by Bertram D. Wolfe and Ben Davidson) after they left the Communist Party in 1929. The Workers School was dissolved through merger in 1944, becoming part of the CPUSA's Jefferson School of Social Science. History Construction worker atop Empire State Building with Chrysler Building below and behind (1930) Background Over the course of the spring and summer of 1919 the Socialist Party of America divided into competing Socialist and Communist wings.The most accessible treatment of this sometimes confusing factional war remains Theodore Draper, The Roots of American Communism. New York: Viking Press, 1957. In the aftermath of this bitter split, the electorally-oriented Socialists retained control of a number of key public institutions of the party, including the Rand School of Social Science, a trade union and party training facility located in New York City. (Historian Marvin E. Gettleman makes clear that the Workers School was seen by the Communists as the \\"historic successor\\" of the Socialists' Rand School.) The revolutionary socialist Communist wing, on the other hand, was rapidly driven underground by successive raids throughout late 1919 and early 1920 conducted at the behest of the Lusk Committee and the Justice Department.See: Draper, The Roots of American Communism, passim. With the country in the throes of the First Red Scare, the various organizations of the Communist movement eked out a furtive underground existence. At the end of 1921 a decision was made by key party leaders, approved and driven ahead by the Communist International, for the Communist Party of America (CPA) to emerge from its underground existence of secret meetings and pseudonyms and to attempt to re-establish itself as a public organization known as the Workers Party of America (WPA). This effort was met with success, as a majority of the Finnish Socialist Federation, the Workers Council group, and others previously opposed to underground political activity flocked to the new organization. Membership soared from barely over 4,000 in the old underground CPA in 1922 to more than 15,000 in the legal WPA in 1923.Tim Davenport, \\"The Communist Party of America (1919-1946): Membership Figures,\\" Early American Marxism website, www.marxisthistory.org/ The presence of such a large body of new members in the American Communist movement presented a challenge for the group of core cadres, as the understanding of party ideology by many of these new members was seen as defective. With the Rand School firmly in the grasp of the WPA's hated rivals, the need for a new party training school was seen as a pressing order of the day. Establishment Samuel Adams Darcy ran the New York Workers School as of 1930 (Source: City of Portland Archives, Oregon, A2001-074.120 - pls cite) By October 1923 a new Communist Party training school had been readied ‚Äî the New York Workers School. The facility was first located 48-50 East 13th Street. It moved to Communist headquarters at 28 East Fourteenth Street on Union Square. In January 1934, the New Masses magazine advertised its address as 35 East 12 Street. The facility moved yet again to a permanent home located at 35 East Twelfth Street ‚Äî a building said by one FBI informant to be so \\"dingy, makeshift, and old\\" that it \\"should have been condemned.\\" As with the rival Rand School of Social Science, the Workers School attempted to train trade union activists as well as key party cadres as part of what Gettleman has called \\"a systematic effort to mobilize learning to support the workers' side in the class struggle.\\" The teaching staff took pains to stress a close connection between learning and action, with a view to a hastening of the overthrow of capitalism. Dissolution The Workers School was absorbed by the Jefferson School of Social Science in 1944 ‚Äî a parallel Communist Party adult educational institution. Organization Marxism embodied in Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels monument in Marx-Engels- Forum, Berlin-Mitte, Germany Curriculum Each term at the school began with publication of an \\"Announcement of Classes.\\" The school launched in the fall of 1923 with a total of 12 courses as part of its curriculum, including Marxism, the history of international workers' movement, tactics of the Communist International, as well as \\"Biologic and Social Evolution.\\" In addition, courses in elementary and advanced English were offered for the benefit of the Communist movement's largely immigrant membership, as well as courses on \\"speech improvement\\" (the elimination of accents) and \\"platform speaking.\\" Courses were conducted at night so that workers could remain on the job without interruption of their lives and financial loss. Workers School class announcements from the 1930s indicate that two successive class blocks ran each night, one running from 7:00 to 8:30 pm, followed by another group of classes meeting from 8:40 to 10:10 pm.American Legion, Isms. Second Edition. Indianapolis, IN: American Legion, 1937. Reproduced in Gettleman, \\"The New York Workers School, 1923-1944,\\" pg. 269. Classes were offered at the Workers School every weekday evening although most met only once or twice per week, with Tuesday being the night of the lightest course offerings. By 1927 the number of courses offered by the school had tripled, including courses on \\"Citizenship and Naturalization,\\" labor journalism, and the creation and operation of shop newspapers, among others. The school's \\"core course,\\" entitled \\"Fundamentals of Communism,\\" was taught in six different classes, including a day course for workers on the night shift. By the middle 1930s as many as 50 sections in this key course were offered at the Workers School and in satellite classrooms around New York City. The school occasionally published its own cheap editions of Marxist \\"classics\\" or issued its own textbooks, including one by leading Yiddish-language Communist Moissaye Olgin. Teaching method By the time of its 15th anniversary in 1938, the Workers School had developed its own pedagogic method, forsaking the traditional academic format of lecture and recitation for a variation of the Socratic method in which short lectures were made with a view to posing of key questions for joint discussion by students.Richard H. Rovere, \\"School for Workers,\\" The New Masses, vol. 29, no. 12 (Dec. 13, 1938), pg. 18. This teaching method, borrowed from a small set of elite liberal arts colleges in the New England region,These included Sarah Lawrence College, Bennington College, the New College at Columbia University, and some courses at Yale and Harvard. See: Rovere, \\"School for Workers,\\" pg. 18. was intended to shift the responsibility for learning to the students themselves. People The Communist Party's National Agit-Prop Director Bertram D. Wolfe headed the New York Workers School throughout the 1920s. Joseph R. Brodsky had an as-yet undefined affiliation with the school. =Directors= * 1923-1929: Bertram D. Wolfe, assisted by Ben Davidson (politician) (better known by his \\"party name,\\" D. Benjamin). (Both of these taught at the Workers School in a full- time capacity, and both would leave the Communist Party with expelled leader Jay Lovestone in 1929, taking up work at the so-called New Workers School established by the rival Communist political organization which they helped found.) * 1929-1938: Abraham Markoff, a New York pharmacist who died in 1938 * 1938-1944: Will Weinstone =Advisory Council= Members of the advisory council included: * David Saposs: labor historian * Elizabeth Gurley Flynn: former IWW organizer * Floyd Dell: editor of The Masses * John Dos Passos: left wing novelist =Teachers= Many prominent leftists taught there including: * Herbert Aptheker * Alexander Bittelman (on Tactics of the Third International) * Earl Browder (on the Chinese Revolution) * Arthur W.

Wilkerson =Students= * David Jenkins (later director of the California Labor School * Murray Bookchin, communalist (1921‚Äî2006) Tuition and participation In the estimation of the leading academic expert on the New York Workers School, the institution was largely self-supporting, with student tuition providing funds for the payment of modest salaries to the part-time teaching staff. The cost of a 12-week course meeting once a week at the time of the Workers School's launch in 1923 was $3.50. This fee was raised to $4 in 1927, with twice-weekly classes in English language instruction priced at $6 for the 12 week term. Reduced fees were available to trade unions and various other fraternal organizations seeking to sponsor students on scholarship. A core teaching staff taught between 10 and 15 classes a week in exchange for a weekly salary of $12 ‚Äî an amount which was insufficient to cover the costs of life in New York City. Pressure was placed upon instructors to maintain enrollment in the school by conducting classes in a lively style as for both political and economic reasons high enrollment levels by the Workers School's administration. Admission to the New York Workers School was not limited to members of the Communist Party and its youth section, the Young Communist League, but also included non-party students. Indeed, the Workers School was envisioned not only as a training center but as a means of recruiting talented and sympathetic individuals into the Communist Party. Students at the school were mostly of working class origin and were often immigrants to the United States. Workers in shoe, garment, and jewelry manufacturing as well as the building trades were particularly well represented, as were students having jobs in restaurants and retail shops. Participation topped the 1,000 student mark in the fall of 1926. Annual attendance at the peak of the CPUSA's educational effort was approximately 5,000 students.Peter Filardo, \\"Guide to the Jefferson School of Social Science (New York, N.Y.) Records and Indexes,\\" Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives, New York University, New York City, 2009. Eventually the Workers School would open up satellite schools in the Bronx, Harlem, Brooklyn, and in several New Jersey industrial towns across from New York City on the other side of the Hudson River. The school launched its own magazine, The Student-Worker, in February 1927, with members of the Student Council serving as the editorial staff of the publication.\\"Workers' School Students Have Magazine; Interesting Article in First Issue,\\" Daily Worker, vol. 4, no. 35 (February 23, 1927), pg. 4. Content of the magazine's first issue included a contribution by Bertram D. Wolfe, Director of the Workers School, as well as material produced by students on the aims of the school, teaching methods, and the selection of course topics. In the fall of 1929 participation was pegged at \\"over 1200,\\" of whom about 20 percent were enrolled in basic English classes and the rest taking courses in history, politics, or other party training courses.\\"1200 Attend Workers School,\\" Daily Worker, vol. 6, no. 188 (October 14, 1929), pg. 2. This represented a new record enrollment for the institution.\\"Workers School Starts Second Week Tonight,\\" Daily Worker, vol. 6, no. 189 (October 15, 1929), pg. 2. It was noted in October 1929 that the New York Workers School also maintained a Ruthenberg Library and reading room, which was open nightly from 6:30 until 9:30 pm. A campus newspaper was also launched at that date, Workers' School Journal, which was to be run under student management and to publish contributions made by students at the school. Branch campuses Branches opened in the New York City area: the Bronx, Harlem, Brooklyn, and towns in New Jersey. Although the bulk of operations of the New York Workers School was conducted at its main facility, small branch campuses were periodically added in order to improve accessibility. In the fall of 1929 the Communist Party operated a \\"Bronx Branch of the Workers' School,\\" located at 2700 Bronx Park East. A total of 60 students began the fall term at that location. Impact Passaic strikers with children picketing outside White House in Washington, DC (1926) In the late 1920s, the Workers School advocated for issues including the Sacco and Vanzetti trials, \\"Hands-Off-China\\" (for Shanghai Massacre), and \\"Passaic Relief\\" (for the Passaic Textile Strike). In 1949, FBI undercover agent/informer Angela Calomiris testified during the Foley Square trial that she took \\"educational courses\\" on communism at the Jefferson School of Social Service and the New York Workers School. In the 1950s, the Workers School remained part of discussion of Communist infiltration in America. For example, in 1959, Frank Meyer, then anti-communist editor at National Review magazine, formerly a communist educator, testified to three phases of Communist training operations: 1) public agitation and propaganda, 2) molding of hard-core Communists, and 3) inner party training schools, the last of which, as he explains was: > ... for the purpose of putting a final hardness, understanding from the > party's point of view, toughness, on the Communist who is already > approaching top leadership positions ... > The third type of training consists of a network of schools, full-time > party schools, from the local level ‚Äî section schools ‚Äî through district > schools, to national schools, and finally to the international schools that > have been run over the years under various names by the international > Communist movement. Legacy In the estimation of one historian, for all its advocacy of political militance by the staff of the New York Workers School, the actual outcome was mild: > Anticommunist ideologues entertained lurid fantasies of party cadres > stepping right out from a classroom discussion of one of Lenin's pamphlets > and violently assaulting the U.S. Government. But, despite the rhetoric of > direct action, and student-staff willingness to apply communist doctrines on > the streets, on picket lines, or in union struggles, there is no evidence > that would suggest that the Workers School, or any other party educational > enterprise, was some U.S. equivalent of the Smolny Institute, the academy > from which the Russian Bolsheviks made their successful armed seizure of > state power in 1917.\\" The New York Workers School was emulated by the Communist Party on a smaller scale in other key American industrial cities during the period of its greatest strength, the late 1930s and early 1940s.Harvey Klehr, The Heyday of American Communism: The Depression Decade. New York: Basic Books, 1984; pg. 372. Former Soviet spy Whittaker Chambers mentioned the Workers School (which he called the \\"Workers Center\\") in his memoirs: > Behind Comrade Angelica sat Comrade Tom O'Flaherty. He was a big, unhappy > Irishman, who lived sadly in the shadow of his celebrated brother, Liam, the > author of The Informer and The Assassin . He drank heavily, and I have > sometimes seen him lying, stiff and foul, in front of the Workers Center on > Union Square.

He was born and educated in New Zealand, later moving to England, to take up a Doctorate in Engineering at Clare College, Cambridge. He was employed for a period of time at the then Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, after which he was appointed to the Engineering Department of the University of Oxford, where he stayed for twenty years. Later, he held the position of Professor of Mathematics at Imperial College, London.  Early years and education  Spence, the son of a lawyer, was born in Auckland, New Zealand on 3 January 1926. He was educated at King‚Äôs College, Auckland and the University of Auckland, from which he graduated with a both a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Science. He then moved to England where he undertook research in Engineering at Clare College, Cambridge. He was awarded his Doctorate in 1952.  Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough  After completing his doctorate, Spence took up employment at The Royal Aircraft Establishment, where he undertook research relating to the design of aircraft wings. His paper, 'The lift coefficient of a thin, jet-flapped wing', his most significant work of the period, appeared in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, in 1956. He also studied the propagation of shock waves, specifically how such waves are weakened by viscosity, which is of particular relevance to supersonic flight.  Academic Career and Research Interests  In 1964, Spence left Farnborough to take up the position at the Engineering Department of the University of Oxford, becoming a Fellow of Lincoln. He remained at Oxford for about twenty years, applying his mathematical techniques to a range of topics, including the compression of solids. This latter work enabled him to apply his skills to the study of magma flow beneath the earth's surface, and how it behaves in the presence of fractures, thereby obtaining a better understanding of volcanic eruptions. Spence's final years were spent as Professor of Mathematics at Imperial College, London, where he taught mathematics to engineering and science students. He continued his research across a range of disciplines, one of which involved the use of injected water to enhance oil recovery from a well - important for energy conservation of depleting reserves in areas such as the North Sea. His research interests were energised by his many visits to universities in Australia, New Zealand and the United States.  1991 - 2003  In 1991, at the age of 65 years, Spence retired from his chair at Imperial College, London. His intellectual interest in mathematics and science, expanded to include political history and the law. David Allan Spence died in Headington, Oxford, on 7 September 2003, aged 77. He was survived by his wife, Isobel and their two sons and two daughters. A friend, eminent New Zealand judge Baron Cooke of Thorndon, described Spence as perceptive and analytical of human motivation to an extent bordering on cynicism. While deeply respectful of significant achievement in any walk of life he nevertheless had an \\"attitude towards authority markedly less than reverential - which may at times have hindered his career\\". Spence was a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society, and of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications, and was a member of the London Mathematical Society.

Biography  Ambrosi was born to a family of herders in Borgo Valsugana, the present day Italian province of Trentinoat that time part of the (Princely) County of Tyrol, a crown land of the Austrian Empire. He was not able to attend school, but he pursued self-taught studies in the natural sciences, history, philosophy and, in particular, botany. He devoted himself to botany by studying under Francesco Angelo Facchini and Casimiro Sartorelli, focusing on the flora of the Trentino region. He published many scientific works, notably, in 1851, Prospetto delle specie zoologiche conosciute nel Trentino. In 1853 he married Elisa Zanollo, and the couple would have eight children together, though five of died in infancy. In 1854 he began publishing the journal La flora del Tirolo meridionale, which was discontinued in 1857 before he was able to complete the detailed list, after a fire destroyed his house in the city of Trento, including all his archives and collections. In 1864, Ambrosi was appointed director of both the Trento Public Library and the adjoining Trento Museum of Natural Sciences. In that role, he was able to facilitate a series of initiatives, including the establishment of a chair for the teaching of Italian history and literature in 1869, and the publication of the periodical Historical Archive for Istria, Trieste and Trento from 1881. He became close friends with Fortunato Vincenzo Zeni, one of the founders of the Museo civico di Rovereto, and worked with German scholar Theodor Mommsen to expand his expertise on, and organize his collection of epigraphs.Theodor Mommsen e l'Italia, Atti del Convegno (Rome, 3-4 November 2003), Accademia dei Lincei, Rome 2004, p. 219 Ambrosi's work at the library and museum could consume his attention for the remaining decades of his life, reducing his study of botany while increasing his focus on history, geography and anthropology. He facilitated the expansion of the library to a collection of forty thousand volumes. Because of his patriotic and pro-Italian sentiments, in 1881 Ambrosi was tried, by the Austro-Hungarian government, on charges of breaking press laws, for holding in the library a volume censored by the public security authorities. Ambrosi was a member of several scientific, cultural, national and international institutions, including the Soci√©t√© botanique de France, the Accademia Roveretana degli Agiati in nearby Rovereto, and the Societ√† degli Alpinisti Tridentini. He also became interested in zoology, writing some memoirs about birds and an important treatise on the Trentino bear.F.

Doty spent his childhood in May, Oklahoma, then attended Oklahoma A&M; (now Oklahoma State University), and received a degree in architectural engineering in 1928. During the Great Depression that immediately followed Doty's graduation, Doty found intermittent work, but was unable to establish a business in Oklahoma City. In order to make a living, Doty signed up with the Civilian Conservation Corps, first as a file clerk, then as an architect in the state parks program. Doty was hired by Park Service design director Herbert Maier to complete plans for a museum building at Glacier National Park, and absorbed Maier's style by studying the design guidelines issued by Maier, which contained prototype designs executed by Maier and Park Service staff for national and state parks. By January 1935, Doty was promoted to associate engineer and given responsibility, together with landscape architect Harry Cornell, for the state parks of Kansas and Oklahoma.

Doty designed his new workplace, the Santa Fe Regional Office, while still in Oklahoma, completing the design after moving to Santa Fe. Doty moved to the San Francisco Office in 1940, where he took on work for the new White Sands National Monument. During World War II Doty worked on major war effort projects like the Alcan Highway and Shasta Dam. Following the war in 1946 he became the Park Service's regional architect in 1948. He designed the lodge at Hurricane Ridge in Olympic National Park and the Joshua Tree National Park administration building. In 1954 Doty joined the Western Office of Design and Construction, where he assumed a leadership role in the Mission 66 project. Doty spent some of his post-Mission 66 time with the park service on projects at the National Mall in Washington. retiring in 1968. He lived in Walnut Creek, California in the 1980s.

It is the only hospital on the island of approximately 120,000 inhabitants.VUmc versterkt band met Arubaans ziekenhuis, 4 December 2009 History Entrance of former San Pedro de Verona hospital The hospital is named after the first physician of Aruban origin, who used to treat patients in his home (Quinta del Carmen) before the first hospital of Aruba, San Pedro de Verona was founded by catholic nuns in 1920. San Pedro de Verona hospital was converted into a nursing home in 1977 when Dr. Horacio Oduber Hospital started receiving its first patients. Between 1938 and 1985 the Lago oil refinery in San Nicolas owned a second hospital, who served primarily its employees, their families and privately insured citizens. It was not until 1985 when the Lago hospital was closed, that HOH became the only hospital on the island. HOH is a general hospital and a level III trauma center.Geschiedenis Location and accessibility HOH is located in the area of Eagle Beach in Oranjestad, Aruba, right in front of the low-rise hotel area, and within 5 minutes of the high-rise hotel-strip at Palm Beach. The hospital is easily accessible by major highways, including the Sasaki-corridor and the Kibaima-Tanki Flip roadway, which connects the largest urban areas of Aruba. The furthest urban areas are within 20 minutes of HOH by ground ambulance, while the distance to most rural areas can be up to 45 minutes by road. The hospital has an active helipad with all procedures in place to receive patients by police and navy helicopters.Woman airlifted to hospital Medical staff The medical disciplines available in HOH include general medicine, general surgery, internal medicine, neurology, neuro-surgery, orthopedic surgery, pediatry, gynaecology, cardiology, nephrology, gastro- enterology, anesthesiology, ophthalmology, bariatric surgery, otolaryngology, psychiatry, oncology, pathology, intensive care medicine, plastic surgery, dermatology, obstetrics, pulmonology, radiology and urology.azv aruba Specialized physicians are either contracted by HOH or work privately as independent consultants. As Aruba does not train its own physicians, most medical staff at HOH are trained in the Netherlands, while the rest are trained in other countries of Europe or Latin America. However HOH is a training facility for residents, medical students and nurses from selected Dutch universities and a locally established vocational nursing school.Salubridad & Servicio ¬´ Colegio EPI ArubaLa salud en las Am√©ricas - Google Boeken The nursing and paramedical staff at HOH include individuals from Aruba, Cura√ßao, Sint Martin, Surinam, the Netherlands, Belgium, Scotland, Germany, the UK, Canada, Colombia, Venezuela, Costa Rica, Mexico among other countries, which creates a unique multi-lingual environment.

Oncological cases are sent to the radio-therapy facility of the Sint Elisabeth Hospital in Cura√ßao. Divers with decompression sickness are sent to Bonaire to the Fundashon Mariadal in Bonaire. Candidates for organ transplantation or complex maxillofacial surgery and patients with growth and puberty disorders are also referred to the mainland or the Netherlands.azv aruba At the same time, HOH frequently receives patients from smaller hospitals on nearby islands like Bonaire, St. Martin, Saba, Statia and occasionally from Cura√ßao as particularly intensive care beds and neonatology incubators are limited in this region. HOH also receives daily referrals from the Intituto Medico San Nicolas (IMSAN), a large out-patient facility in the San Nicolas area, which attends approximately 16.000 patients through its emergency department.

He got a job as an assistant clerk at the Recette g√©n√©rale des Imp√¥ts (like a receiver general, but for tax) in Orl√©ans and then he worked for a local newspaper called Le Progr√®s du Loiret. He then began to publish his poems, some of which were written in the Beauceron patois. He got the opportunity to have them heard by a troupe of Parisian artists on tour. After receiving some encouragement, Cout√© decided at the age of 18 in 1898 to go to Paris. After several lean yeans, he found some success in cabarets. He also collaborated with Th√©odore Botrel for the journal La Bonne Chanson. Singer and poet Jehan Rictus, who based his poems on the use of slang, was aware of Cout√©'s talent and said of him, \\"Georges Oble and me, we were undoubtedly in the presence of a teenager of genius who, to his extraordinary gifts, already combined a most skilful technique and in-depth knowledge of the profession\\". He also contributed to the libertarian newspapers La Barricade and frequently La Guerre Sociale. He had a difficult end to his life: tuberculosis, absinthe and poverty. He died in 1911 from pulmonary congestion 24 hours after being taken to Lariboisi√®re Hospital. At the time, he was about to be brought before the cour d'assises for having published an antimilitarist and revolutionary song in La Guerre Sociale praising \\"facts qualified as crimes\\".

He was the eldest son of Alain de Gu√©briant, an aristocrat and large landowner who was mayor and general councilor of the town. He decided to become expert in agriculture, and obtained a diploma from the National Institute of Agronomy in Paris in 1903. He adopted the ideas of social Catholicism, and in 1911 he founded the first agricultural mutual accident insurance fund. He favored the creation of municipal unions led by a peasant elite committed to developing Breton agriculture. After World War I (1914‚Äì18) he became president of the fund. From 1919 to 1941 he chaired the Office Central de Landerneau, which later became Triskalia, a Breton agricultural cooperative. Herv√© de Gu√©briant initiated an agrarian revival in the inter-war period to compensate for the loss of political influence of the monarchists and to revive the social and political engagement of the great aristocratic families. He became a leading figure in French agriculture, and in 1927 was elected first president of the Chambre d‚ÄôAgriculture du Finist√®re.

He was born on 3 August 1837 in Di√©moz and died on 30 December 1905. He was the son of Maximilian and Florine Jacques Reverchon. His father was a follower of the ideas of Charles Fourier (1772‚Äì1837), and he decided to join Victor Prosper Considerant (1808‚Äì1893) in La R√©union (Dallas), near Dallas, Texas. Julien, who displayed an interest in the natural world at a young age, had already amassed a collection of nearly 2,000 species of plants with his brother. The family arrived at La R√©union in December 1856 and learned of the failure of the Fourier colony. Jacques Reverchon then bought a small farm in the vicinity. Julien began to study the local flora. He married Marie Henri on 24 July 1864; they had two sons who died of typhoid fever in 1884. After abandoning botany for a few years, he started collecting plants in 1869, when he made an expedition to collect fossils with Jacob Boll (1828-1880) in West Texas. With subsequent collections, he contributed to the production of noted floras by Asa Gray (1810‚Äì1888) and Charles Sprague Sargent (1841‚Äì1927) and the enrichment of many American collections. He taught botany at the end of his life in Dallas. At the time of his death, more than 2,600 species were cultured in his farm, and he possessed a rich herbarium of 20,000 specimens.

It was prototyped in January 1999 at iCentrix Ltd in Andover, Hampshire, UK, by former Caldera UK employees led by Roger Alan Gross and Andrew Thomas Wightman. The concept behind MarioNet was to build a thin-client browser to provide web-based content to very small client platforms with little RAM or ROM and minimal processing power. It was designed to run on a range of embedded operating systems or indeed a ROM platform without an operating system. The server side used Mozilla, the recently open-sourced web browser based on Netscape's Navigator. A proprietary protocol called OPTIC was used to communicate between the two parts. Target client devices included cell phones, tablet devices, touch screen information kiosks and vending machines.  Functional overview  A unique feature of the MarioNet design was its split architecture. The majority of the browser code resided on a web server where most of the work would be done including HTML processing, image rendering for the target device and the connection to the World Wide Web. The remote controlled client was a small graphics engine which simply uncompressed and displayed images and relayed mouse movements and keystrokes (hence the marionette play on words). This technology is also called a cloud browser. Web browsers are large complex programs, including back then. They are resource- intensive and to perform well they require multiple client/server connections. The design had at its core a light-weight proprietary transport protocol called OPTIC (Optimized Protocol for Transport of Images to Clients). This protocol was very simple and required only a single connection between the client and a server. OPTIC would run over any transport protocol from RS-232 serial communications to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. On startup, the client sent the characteristics of the screen (resolution, color depth, physical size etc.) to the server where the images were processed and rendered for the target device. They would then be compressed and sent via the OPTIC protocol to the client for display. The design of client software was just a few kilobytes of code and was based on Wightman's own tiny ROMable graphical windowing system called GROW (Graphical ROMable Object Windows) which he had developed whilst at Digital Research in the early 1990s. The server browser based on Mozilla was restructured to incorporate a client-side rendering capability and support for the OPTIC protocol.  Proof of concept  A proof of concept was developed and trialled at Kimpton Primary School in Hampshire, UK. A cyber cafe was created in the school's library comprising a Linux web server appliance and legacy 286 PCs running the client part. The trial generated some interest in the media and received a further boost when Sir George Young MP, attended a demonstration given by Gross at Kimpton School. Despite early interest, the team struggled to raise the funding required to patent the invention and develop the concept into a commercial product, so iCentrix was dissolved when Gross joined Citrix UK in Cambridge later on in 1999. The idea languished for several years until the announcement of a similar technology as the Opera Mini in 2005, and Bolt (web browser) in January, 2009, client/server split web browsers with light-weight clients. Later, Amazon announced an Amazon EC2 server based, \\"server-accelerated\\", split-architecture browser, Amazon Silk, for Kindle Fire in 2011.

The film, starring Kris Lemche, Sean Lennon, Danny Masterson, and Geneva Carr, was distributed by Kevin Smith's SModcast Pictures and Phase 4 Films. It premiered was at the Fantasia Film Festival on July 24, 2012, where it was chosen as an official selection. Plot The plot follows the misadventures of the Fridge, an under-appreciated superhero, at a time when superheroes have lost government funding and all public support. In a synopsis by Interview Magazine: \\"Alter Egos inhabits a fantasy world where superheroes are a dime a dozen. If you have the powers, as lead supers Fridge (Kris Lemche), and C-Thru (Joey Kern), do, then, well, you can practice them for good, as long as you follow the guidelines, or at least some of them. Quite obviously, this is a parody of parodies and flips the superhero genre on its head. Like Superman, Fridge is dorky in his human clothes. Unlike Superman, it's not because he has to do so to keep his identity under wraps‚Äîmore like he uses his superhero garb to explore different facets of his personality, as evidenced by the title. Somewhere along the storyline, he must tackle the fact that his girlfriend loves his superhero identity more than his unmasked self, and, naturally, face his nemesis, the man who killed his mom and dad‚Äîalthough he really doesn't want to.\\" Cast * Kris Lemche as Brendan/\\"Fridge\\" * Sean Lennon as \\"Electric Death\\" * Danny Masterson as \\"Jimmy\\" * Geneva Carr as Newscaster * Joey Kern as \\"C-Thru\\" * John Ventimiglia as Shrink * Brooke Nevin as Claudel * Christine Evangelista as Emily * Kristina Klebe as \\"Ice Scream\\" * Marina Squerciati as Dr. Sara Bella * Aur√©lie Claudel as Rich woman * Carlos Velazquez III as Moon Dog Production Musician Sean Lennon, besides playing \\"Electric Death\\", also contributed the musical score for this film. Galland and Lennon have been friends for around 15 years, and have collaborated on each other's albums. Lennon also scored Galland's 2009 feature, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Undead, and also worked with Galland on his award-winning debut short, surreal film Smile for the Camera. Music Rolling Stone editor Matthew Perpetua discusses the process of developing the soundtrack of Alter Egos in an interview with Sean Lennon. Oh No They Didn't states the following: \\"Lennon, who also makes a cameo as a super villain, began working on the project earlier this summer, composing what Galland describes as \\"an epic superhero sound.\\" In Variety, in an interview with Sean Lennon, he discusses the blending of various genres for the soundtrack \\"When it came time for writer/director Jordan Galland to give his friend and musical colleague Sean Lennon instruction on scoring his indie film, \\"Alter Egos,\\" Galland recalls requesting \\"something that feels like 'Twin Peaks' at times and that feels like it's harnessing the power of 'The Dark Knight' at times.\\" Twitch Film Premiered the Trailer on its website, and editor Todd Brown had the following to say about it: \\"While I won't spoil the cause of the 'emotional crisis' here ‚Äî it's contained in the trailer and is pretty damn fantastic ‚Äî this whole thing just oozes style and charm and a sense of comedy based in wit and a sincere love for the genre. Galland takes himself in some new directions here while still preserving the unique voice that made Rosencrantz an indie hit.\\" Release Daniel Schechter, a personal friend of Galland's, did the trailer in exchange for Galland providing the soundtrack for Supporting Characters.

It is found on shallow water coral reefs in the tropical west Atlantic Ocean. It shows a variety of different morphologies depending on its location. It feeds on plankton and derives part of its energy requirements from microalgae found within its tissues. It is an important member of the reef building community and subject to the same threats as other corals. It can cause painful stings to unwary divers. Taxonomy Millepora alcicornis is not a true coral in class Anthozoa but is in class Hydrozoa, and is more closely related to jellyfish than stony corals. Because of the variability in growth habit that this coral exhibits, it has been the subject of much confusion as to its taxonomy, being described under a number of different names from different localities. In 1898, Hickson decided that the variations in morphology were due to environmental factors and that Millepora alcicornis was the valid name for all these species. This conclusion has since been questioned. The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae, but his type locality is unknown. The scientific name comes from the Latin with Millepora meaning \\"thousand-pored\\" and alcicornis meaning \\"elk-horned\\". It seems likely that the type locality is in fact the West Indies. Explaining this in 1941 Crossland wrote \\"I cannot resist the remark that the one thing quite certain about the many forms of Millepora is that none of them have any resemblance to an elk's horn, except perhaps that from the West Indies\\". Description The morphology of Millepora alcicornis is very variable. Most colonies probably start as encrusting forms and adopt a branching structure as they grow. The encrustations can become established on a variety of structures, not only on coral reefs and rocks but also on dead corals and the hulls of wrecked ships. Later development is in the form of plates or blades in habitats with much water movement such as the surf-pounded outer edges of reefs. In calmer waters, such as in deep lagoons or more sheltered parts of the reef, a more upright, leafy or branched structure develops which can grow to tall. The habit of growth is also influenced by the inclination of the surface on which the fire coral grows. On vertical surfaces, the encrusting bases are larger with longer perimeters and the density of branching is lower than it is on horizontal surfaces. The cylindrical branches usually grow in a single plane and span a range of hues from brown to pale, cream-like yellow, while branch tips are white.Fire Coral (Millepora alcicornis) Marine Invertebrates of Bermuda. Retrieved 2012-01-02.Branching fire coral (Millepora alcicornis) Marine Species Identification Portal. Retrieved 2012-01-03. Embedded in the calcareous skeleton are numerous microscopic polyps. They are connected internally by a system of canals and are concealed behind pores in the skeleton, the surface of which is smooth and lacks the corallites of true stony corals. The polyps have specialist functions, the gastrozooids processing and digesting the food caught by the dactylozooids which are grouped around them. The gastrozooids are small and plump and extend four to six tentacle stubs through their pores but are otherwise invisible. The dactylozooids have hairlike tentacles covered in cnidoblasts. Stings from the cnidocysts immobilize an item of prey and the tentacles thrust it through the mouth of an adjacent gastrozooid, from where it passes into the stomach for digestion. The polyps also extrude the coenosteum, the calcareous material of which the skeleton is composed. The coenosteum contains certain symbiotic microalgae called zooxanthellae. These are photosynthetic organisms which provide their hosts with energy and in return benefit from a protective environment in a well lit position. About 75% of the fire coral's energy requirements are provided by the zooxanthellae.Venomous corals: The fire corals Coralmania. Retrieved 2012-01-02. Distribution Millepora alcicornis is found in the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, Florida, the Cape Verde Islands and along the coast of Central and South America as far south as Brazil. It has also been found in Bermuda, but the morphology at that location is so different from that in the rest of its range that it may be a distinct species. It grows at depths of up to and is the only fire coral that often grows at depths greater than . Biology Millepora alcicornis feeds on plankton. The tentacles of the dactylzooids are normally extended all the time. If an object is waved about above the coral, it will cause the tentacles to retract and then the coral can be handled without experiencing the painful stings caused by the cnidocytes. Reproduction is by either asexual or sexual means. Parts of the coral may get detached from the colony by a storm or other means, and some of these fragments may end up in suitable locations to grow into new colonies which will be genetically identical to the parent colony. This fragmentation is probably the most frequent method of reproduction. Alternatively, certain pores called ampullae contain polyps that bud off short-lived, jellyfish-like medusae, which separate from the colony. They produce gametes which, after fertilisation, develop into planula larvae. These drift with the currents as part of the zooplankton before settling out and developing into new colonies. Ecology A number of species of shrimp and fish take refuge among the branches of Millepora alcicornis, seemingly immune to the venom. Hawkfish in particular often perch on top of the fire coral, perhaps protected by their skinless pectoral fins. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Millepora alcicornis has few predators. The fireworm (Hermodice carunculata) sometimes grazes on it, but prefers other corals. Certain nudibranchs in the genus Phyllidia eat it as do filefish in the family Monacanthidae. It has been found that when Millepora alcicornis grows in close proximity to an arborescent gorgonian sea fan, the fire coral becomes aggressive. It produces \\"attack\\" branches which grow out sideways towards the sea fan, develop into hand-like structures and encircle and smother it. The fire coral then uses it as a substrate for new growth. Sometimes this new growth gets separated from the parent colony, and a new colony of fire coral is formed, genetically identical to the original one. This aggressive action is specific to gorgonians and does not happen in response to the close presence of other live or dead corals, other sessile invertebrates or open water. The fire coral seems to be able to detect the gorgonian's presence as a result of water flowing over the surfaces of both. Threats Although not a true coral, Millepora alcicornis is subject to the same general threats that corals and coral reefs are facing. The greatest of these is global warming and the consequent rise in sea temperatures. Millepora alcicornis is one of the first corals to show bleaching as the symbiont zooxanthellae are killed. However, it is also more resilient than most and becomes re-established by recruitment earlier than the scleractinian corals. Other general threats to reefs include ocean acidification, pollution, sedimentation, invasive species and other changes in species dynamics, coral diseases, fisheries, leisure activities and tourism. Small quantities of Millepora alcicornis are gathered for sale to collectors. Human interactions The cnidocytes of Millepora alcicornis are powerful enough to sting human skin. They can inject a venom that causes a painful burning sensation, skin eruptions, blisters and scarring. The toxin has been investigated and is a water-soluble protein, 40 Œºg of which provides a median lethal dose to mice weighing . Millepora alcicornis has no commercial uses but is sometimes kept in reef aquaria. It requires high water movement and bright light to flourish and its health can be judged by its colour, a yellow hue showing health whereas a darker brown colour can indicate too little light. It can be difficult to control because it grows fast and spreads over other objects in the tank.

Biography  Madeleine Barot was the daughter of Alexandre Auguste Barot, a literature teacher from Clermont-Ferrand, and Madeleine Kuss.Mayeur, Encrev√©, [1993], p.58. From 1927 to 1934, she began her studies at Sorbonne University in Paris, where she achieved both a graduate degree in History and a diploma in library/archives. In 1934, she became an intern at the Biblioth√®que nationale de France. She was then hired as a librarian at the √âcole fran√ßaise de Rome, where she worked from June, 1935 to June, 1940.Barrot [1983], p.117. Barot was active in young Protestant associations through the French Federation of Christian Student Associations, founded in 1895.Andr√© Encrev√©, ¬´Les protestants fran√ßais au milieu du XXe si√®cle¬ª, in Dzovinar K√©vonian et al, [2013], p. 41-63. In July‚ÄìAugust 1939, she chaired a committee at the World Conference of Christian Youth in Amsterdam, organized by Willem Visser 't Hooft, which promoted the amalgamation of Protestant movements. She thus became involved in the prewar resistance movement, inspired by Swiss pastor Karl Barth. A friend of pastor Marc Boegner, Barot was named Secretary General of Cimade during a meeting of the heads of young Protestant movements on August 15, 1940, replacing Georgette Siegrist. She held that position until 1956. Madeleine Barot was directly responsible for the presence of Cimade in camps, by first forcing her own way into the Gurs camp thanks to her relentless negotiations with the authorities and then making it a customary feature in all camps. A committed Christian, she also proved to be energetic and well connected nationally as well as internationally. In 1953, Madeleine Barot was put in charge of the \\"Men and Women in the Church and Society\\" department by the World Council of Churches. There, she began important work in carving out a space for women within the church. She was involved in several important organizations: * A Commission for Church support in development; * France's Protestant Federation * Christian Action For the Abolition of Torture * A Conference of Religions for Peace She also continued her work with Cimade. In 1988, she was given the status of Righteous Among the Nations on the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial, which honours people throughout Europe who directly or indirectly helped to protect and support Jews during the Third Reich.

Biography His parents were wealthy ¬´ mulattoes ¬ª - according to the racial vocabulary used at the time - and he received his early education in Basse-Terre, but finished it in Paris, where he graduated in law in 1846. He then devoted himself to the anti-slavery cause, wrote several pamphlets on abolition, and organized a club, which won several statesmen to its cause, including Victor Schoelcher. In 1848 Schoelcher was made under-secretary for the colonies, and, being reminded of his promises by Melvil, caused a decree to be issued freeing all the slaves in the French dominions. The freed slaves showed their gratitude by electing Melvil their deputy to the constituent assembly in 1848. In 1849, and during the whole of Napoleon III's reign, Melvil devoted his time to literary purposes, wrote on the colonies in most of the French magazines, and published biographies of many black citizens of South America. In 1871 he was again elected deputy of Guadeloupe, but was condemned for participation in the Paris Commune, and took refuge in Switzerland until 1880, when he was allowed to return to Guadeloupe.

One of Nigeria's most controversial entertainers, he is best known for his alternative lifestyle, political views, and media productions, most notably The Charly Boy Show. He has served as president of the Performing Musicians Association of Nigeria, and in 2011 was an Idol Series judge. Early life The second son of former Supreme Court justice Chukwudifu Oputa, Oguta-native Oputa was born into a Catholic household, and is the cousin of Swedish musician Dr. Alban. As he often refused to reveal his date of birth in interviews, his age remained unknown until 2011 when he celebrated his sixtieth birthday, however, in his usual enigmatic character, he announced his 63rd birthday on 19 June 2013, making his age a contentious one.My Body is My Altar Although he has described his parents as liberals who always encouraged their children to speak and say what they had in mind, Oputa has also spoken about their conservative nature. He had set out to become a priest,Charly Boy declares his love for Catholic leader in open letter but left seminary school after a year.

Despite this, 1990 was one of Nigeria's best-selling albums of 1988, and Oputa was credited with using his music to stand up to his government, a l√° Fela Kuti. Oputa would also collaborate with Seysener to establish the annual beach concert Lekki Sunsplash. In recent years, Oputa has worked on several collaborations with his cousin Dr. Alban, most notably on the song \\"Carolina\\" which sampled an earlier hit of Dr. Alban's ‚Äì \\"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner\\" ‚Äì and had originally featured singer Michael Rose. The re-worked version was sung in Nigerian Pidgin and was a hit in Nigeria. The pair also recorded the songs \\"Work Work Africa\\" and \\"Commercial Waste\\". Image Charly Boy is well known for his change of image which started with androgyny at the start of his music career. His preference for make-up, relaxed and braided hairstyles, and \\"women's clothes\\" caused controversy among conservative Nigerians. He would later be nicknamed \\"Nigeria's Boy George\\" by entertainment journalists, but claimed that he had started this persona long before his British counterpart became famous.

It was launched on NTA 2 Channel 5 Lagos, and syndicated to other stations across the country, and among the cast were Charly Boy's wife Diane Oputa, actress Stella Damasus, Mercy Oyebo, singing duo Tunde and Wunmi Obe, and Patrick Doyle. Charly Boy's alter-ego Madam ZiZi (a drag character) and monologues which condemned the country's dictatorship were also popular features. Despite its popularity, The Charly Boy Show struggled to receive consistent sponsorship; Charly Boy would later ask celebrity friends to appeal for sponsors on-camera, without much success. The show was cancelled in 2001 after ten years. The Charly Boy Kiddies Show The Charly Boy Kiddies Show was a short-lived spin-off of the original series which was aimed at children. Although the show's creator was a regular cast member, the main stars were children who auditioned to be part of the show. It included segments from the original show including Candid Camera, this time performed by younger actors. Like its predecessor, The Charly Boy Kiddies Show failed to gain sponsors, and was subsequently cancelled. However, in 2010, Charly Boy established The Charly Boy Kiddies Affair in Abuja, which aimed to boost the potential of Nigerian children.Charly Boy hosts kids in Abuja Zoom Time Zoom Time was a The Charly Boy Show politics spin-off co-presented by Charly Boy and Tunde Obe (the latter was also a cast member of The Charly Boy Show) which featured prominent politicians and military men.

Occasionally entertainers, like Regina Askia, were interviewed.

He has on several occasions been tortured by the Nigerian police and the military for standing up to his country's government. However he is also, on occasion, regarded as their friend, depending on the sensibility of those in power. An inspirational writer, Charly Boy focuses on various subjects in several newspapers including The Daily Post and his own publication Charly Boy Magazine, and has been known to write slogans on rocks in Abuja where he currently resides. An avid supporter of Okada riders in Nigeria - an organisation that has been frowned on by government as they have been regarded as a menace and unsafe transportation - he has fought for the rights of Okada users - most of whom are poor individuals who earn their living by using the Okada for commercial purposes; he also stated that operators play a prominent role in government as most politicians engage their services during campaigns. His efforts earned him the name Area Fada.

As a music video producer/director, Charly Boy has worked with numerous music artists including Onyeka Onwenu (\\"Dancing in the Sun\\"), Alex O (\\"She's So Pretty\\"), Floxy Bee (\\"Eko\\"), and Femi Kuti (\\"No Cause For Alarm?\\"). In 1990, Charly Boy was among the Nigerian singers who supported Yvonne Chaka Chaka ‚Äì then the face of Pepsi in Africa ‚Äì in a series of concerts and featured in a commercial for the brand with Femi Kuti and Evi-Edna Ogosi. He was also in a number of Target cigarettes print commercials with his wife Diane. Controversy In 1988, the album \\"1990\\" included the song \\"Big Bottom\\", a tribute to the female derriere. In most Nigerian states it was denied airplay on radio due to its somewhat raunchy lyrics. The accompanying video, deemed ahead of its time, features Charly Boy's wife Diane as a woman with a generous posterior who is a guest at Charly Boy's wedding; as she bends over during the ceremony, the groom turns around to stare at her rear, to the annoyance of his bride. Other features of the video were members of the public who are unaware that their buttocks are on camera, and a woman in a bikini-top dancing provocatively. The \\"Big Bottom\\" video was subsequently banned by the Nigeria Broadcasting Commission on grounds of obscenity .Big Bottom The Charly Boy Show was widely criticised for being overtly sexual ‚Äì Charly Boy's dancers (known as \\"Charly's Angels\\")Charly Boy and His Angels were often shown clothed in S&M; outfits and brandishing whips.

In 2010, Charly Boy was interviewed by the magazine E 24-7 alongside equally maverick Channel O presenter Denrele. The article, captioned \\"Caught In The Act - Yes, I Love Denrele\\" featured photographs of the pair in suggestive poses including a mouth-to-mouth kiss.

Since 2001, the Industrial Property Department of the government of Vietnam has the name \\"Phu Quoc Fish Sauce\\" as a trademark, and only registered manufacturers are allowed to use the name in Vietnam. Such protection, however, does not extend worldwide. In 2012, Phu Quoc fish sauce was granted a European Union Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status. Background Traditional Phu Quoc fish sauce has been made solely out of fermented anchovies, salt, and water for over 200 years. The waters around The island are rich in seaweed and plankton which provide food for the anchovy population. However, it only since the late 1950s that the product has been recognized outside of its home island, reaching its zenith of popularity between 1965 and 1975. With increasing government subsidies of many industries in the period from 1975 to 1985, the local fish sauce craft lost market share to larger competitors, but in recent years, the popularity of the authentic Phu Quoc product has been rebounding. In 2012, Phu Quoc fish sauce was granted a European Union Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status. Currently, Phu Quoc fish sauce production has reached 8 million liters / year. Production Phu Quoc fish sauce is made from anchovies that have been fermented in brine in large barrels measuring in diameter and in height, containing 7 to 13 tons of product. The barrels are made from braided rattan from the local mountains, and can be used for up to 60 years. While any kind of fish can also be used to make the fish sauce, Phu Quoc sauce is made exclusively from anchovies harvested from waters surrounding the island. During the fishing season (which extends from July to December), fishermen harvest anchovies by net, removing the anchovies from among other fish and items in the nets, and immediately combining them with salt at a 3:1 ratio in water tanks. Differences Phu Quoc fish sauce is differentiated by its color, which is due entirely to the ingredients and is not the result of any coloring agents. Development issues Currently, Phu Quoc fish sauce is facing two problems: * The anchovy population that is the main resource for this product is endangered by overfishing and other environmental degradation. * The perceived quality of the product has been marred by lesser products using the name prior to the establishment of the trademark protection. Trademark protection has been denied in some foreign countries due to overuse of the term by other manufacturers prior to the Phu Quoc producers' efforts to obtain trademark protection.

Studies of NGC 3114 NGC 3114 has first been subject of studies in 1963, when Jankowitz and McCosh obtained photographic UBV photometry for 171 of its stars and photoelectric UBV photometry of 52 stars. They estimated the cluster to be 910 parsecs from the Sun, its mean visual extinction E(B-V) = 0.27 and its age to range from 6\\\\times 10^{7} and 2\\\\times 10^{8} years. In 1988, Schneider and Weiss obtained photometry data for 122 stars, revising the cluster reddening to be E(B-V) = 0.03. Three years later, Sagar and Sharpless made the largest data recording of the cluster to date, obtaining BV CCD photometry of around 350 stars from seven 3.6'√ó5.4' regions. Because these regions were rather far from the cluster centre, a substantial contamination was expected. Nevertheless, by assuming the cluster reddening value obtained by Schneider and Weiss, they found the cluster to be 940 \\\\pm 60 pc, which agreed with the measurements taken 28 years previously by Jankowitz and McCosh.

In addition, he was the Minister for Economic Affairs for Argentina and served as an ambassador for Argentina to the United States and the United Kingdom and Spain. He was born in Buenos Aires in March 1819 and died in London, in 1898. He functioned as the finance minister during the presidency of Domingo Faustino Sarmiento. He was nephew of Miguel Can√© Andrade and cousin in first degree of Miguel Can√© Casares. Early activism In 1837 Dom√≠nguez was one of the founders and organizers of the Literary Salon. During that time he wrote his most famous poem, El Omb√∫. In 1839 he took refuge in Montevideo along with other members of the Generaci√≥n del 37 and supported, via the media, the French blockade and invasion of General Juan Lavalle, in the Buenos Aires province. He remained in Montevideo during the long siege that was imposed on former President Manuel Oribe, dedicate himself to the press. For a short time he was a military officer, but soon afterwards was appointed official of the ministry of war. In 1843 he won a literary contest with El Omb√∫, and by 1845 he wrote the Ode to Montevideo. Career After the battle of Caseros Dom√≠nguez returned to Buenos Aires, where his participation in the press led to his being elected provincial representative. In June he opposed the San Nicolas Agreement. Some time later he was elected deputy to the constituent congress of Santa F√©, which - due to the revolution of September 11, 1852 - was not incorporated. Instead, he was one of the authors of the constitution of the separatist state of Buenos Aires. He was a civil servant and journalist during the period of the divided republic, and ambassador to several countries in Europe. In 1856 he was editor of the newspaper El Orden, together with Felix Frias. Three years later he was sent to Parana to demand the repeal of the \\"law of differential rights\\" with which the Argentina Confederacy was to defend the economic absorption on the part of Buenos Aires. In 1860 he was a member of the Buenos Aires convention which proposed amendments to the Constitution. The following year he wrote a History of Argentina - strongly biased against federalism, which he completed in 1820 - and which, for a long time was the official textbook for teaching national history in the country. Political career After the battle of Pav√≥n, he was secretary to General Bartolom√© Mitre and finance minister of the Buenos Aires governor Mariano Saavedra. He joined the Autonomist Party of Adolfo Alsina and accompanied him in his administration as governor of Buenos Aires. He was Member of Parliament and member of the convention for the reformation of the Constitution. His campaign for the presidential candidacy of Domingo Faustino Sarmiento in Buenos Aires was unsuccessful, but he still earned the President's appreciation, who appointed him as finance minister. The economy of his day was marked by the problems of the Paraguay War and the civil war, so the overall economic situation was not favorable. Moreover, his economic ideas were of a free trade doctrine which was strongly criticized as simply applying imported recipes, little suited to the situation in Argentina at that time. The crisis that began with Sarmiento became worse, and would end up exploding in the government of Nicolas Avellaneda. When he left office he was appointed financial representative in London. In that city he rewrote his History of Argentina, which was disseminated in the academic English community as the first full history of Argentina translated into that language. In 1873 he was provincial constitutional standard, and was later ambassador to Peru, Brazil, USA and finally England, during the administrations of Avellaneda, Roca and Celman.

Biography   Early life and World War I  He was the son of Henri, an anarchist carpenter from Nantes, and Hortense Roulot, a chair-maker from M√©nilmontant. However he was orphaned at the age of 14. He was self taught and developed a passion for books then he started to frequent libertarian circles. He thus met Jean Grave, Paul Delesalle, Victor Serge. He was part of the Anti-Stalinist left. During World War I, he was drafted within the 5th Battalion of Foot Soldiers, and was sent on the frontline on August 12, 1916. He is wounded at Chemin des Dames by a shrapnel on October 23, 1917. He will recount his war experience in Pain de soldat (Soldier's Bread).  Author  In May 1922, he attended the International Congress of Progressive Artists and signed the \\"Founding Proclamation of the Union of Progressive International Artists\\". He was hired in 1923 by Editions Grasset, as director of the press service. Until his retirement in 1956, he was acting as literary advisor. However he led his fight for proletarian literature with a manifesto book (Nouvel √¢ge litt√©raire, New Literary Age), a review (New Literary Age then New Age), a collection (Les romans of the New Age) at the √âditions Valois. He devotes all his energy to the promotion of proletarian literature, introduces many authors from the world of work. New Literary Age (1930), his manifesto book traces the history of this literature. \\"This is, in our opinion, proletarian literature: the fact of using the 'written thing' to stand up.\\" His humanitarian, pacifist and anti-militarist commitment has been seen on many occasions:  In 1925, he signed a manifesto against the war in Morocco.  In 1927, he signed the petition (published on April 15 in the Europe newspaper) against the law on the general organization of the nation at times of war which abrogated all intellectual independence and all freedom of opinion. His name rubbed shoulders with those of Alain, Lucien Descaves, Louis Guilloux, Jules Romains, S√©verine ...  in 1939, he is jailed for a short while because he signed a pacifist leaflet by Louis Lecoin.  Publisher  He sought to promote proletarian literature, differentiating it from populism and from the literature of communist proletarians. Following on from the work of Jules Michelet, Charles P√©guy, Georges Sorel, but also Ramuz, he called for a literature made by the people and for the people, which should be the work of writers originating from the people. Two examples are Constant Malva, a minor from Borinage or Rose Combe, an Auvergne gatekeeper, which he publishes in his series \\"The novels of the New Age\\". To be \\"authentic\\", the writer must have a thorough knowledge of the environment he wants to portray. The writer who wants to describe the working class must therefore be born in this class. \\"To talk about poverty, you have to have known it,\\" says Poulaille. From the 1940s, he turned to other manifestations of popular culture, such as \\"Christmas carols‚Äù, \\"chanson de toile\\" and became interested in new media (records and cinema).

It is often an important element in the defensive system of hill castles, especially in Germany and other parts of Central Europe. Originally, the term neck ditch was only applied to spur castles. These were sited on hill spurs where three sides of the castle were protected by steep hillsides. Realistically they could only be attacked from the direction of the higher ground of the hill itself. The castle would therefore be separated from the rest of the hill by a dry ditch or moat which, for practical reasons, was cut across the narrowest part of the spur, the \\"bottleneck\\", hence the name. The castle was then only accessible over a bridge ‚Äì usually a drawbridge. Today the term neck bridge is also used for other types of castle, where there is a deep, dry moat on one or two sides, whilst the other sided are protected by inaccessible terrain. For example, a ditch may be cut across the neck of a spit or peninsula in the case of a lowland castle that is otherwise surrounded by water. Many old neck ditches have since become thickly overgrown and may only be made out with some difficulty. Examples of castles with neck ditches in the classical sense are Liebenstein, Rochlitz, Kriebstein and Isenburg. If other parts of a castle, such as the outer and inner wards, are separated with such moats, they are known as cross ditches (German: Abschnittsgraben).

In 1801 he was appointed a Lord of the Admiralty by Henry Addington, which post he held till 1804; but the death of his father-in-law, his wife, and only child within a few days of one another (5 and 9 August 1803) caused a personal breakdown. He died on 5 April 1806.

B√©c≈ìur's parents were well-placed. His father, Fran√ßois B√©c≈ìur, was an apothecary, his mother, Anne Vaucremont, was the daughter of a doctor. He studied pharmacy first with his father and then in Germany, and finally in Paris where he attended the courses of Antoine de Jussieu. He then returned to Metz. He was initially interested first in philosophy and mathematics but then devoted himself to natural history studying mainly insects and birds. At this time conservation techniques were mediocre. B√©coeur developed a method that preserved bird specimens and prevented them from being damaged by insect attack. He sent birds thus prepared to the Jardin du Roi, later to become the Mus√©um national d'Histoire naturelle, which earned him the praises of Georges- Louis Buffon and helped revolutionize the conservation of birds and ornithology at the museum. He tried several times, but without success, to become an assistant at the museum. His method of conservation was based on arsenic but he died without publishing the recipe of the arsenical soap. It appeared again early in the nineteenth century in publications by Daudin and Dufresne, who were connected with the Mus√©um d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris. B√©coeur's secret had been handed over to Fran√ßois Levaillant (1753‚Äì1828), who sold the recipe together with his collection of birds, animals and plants to the French government in 1797. The arsenical soap remained in widespread usage until the 1950s. B√©coeur was an associate of Fran√ßois Levaillant, who played a significant role in the establishment of French ornithology. The huge collection of B√©coeur was purchased by the Duke of Zweibr√ºcken for the cabinet of curiosities of the Ch√¢teau de Karlsberg, destroyed after the Siege of Mainz in 1793.

The son of an attorney for the Count of Nantes, he was destined for the priesthood and received his first tonsure in December 1771, but renounced his vows following the death of his elder brother. He succeeded his father, and was married in April 1781. In his role as an attorney, he also added the role of notary in the fief of the bishop, called the fief of Reguaires. An early member of the Society of Friends of the Constitution, in 1792 he founded the Cordeliers Club of Nantes. In November 1792, he was elected to the municipality of Nantes. When the War in the Vend√©e broke out, a central committee was created in Nantes on 13 March; as a notable of the city, he was called by the municipality of the commune to run it. On 11 October 1793, this committee was abolished by the representatives Pierre Philippeaux, Pierre-Mathurin Gillet, and Albert Ruelle, and replaced by the Comit√© de surveillance r√©volutionnaire (\\"Revolutionary Oversight Committee\\") under the decree of 25 September. Along with the bishop Julien Min√©e, Bachelier was the only one of the founding members of the committee that remained in place. Arrested with the other members of the committee, they stood trial by the Revolutionary Tribunal of Paris between October and December 1794. Bachelier was acquitted, and retired to Nantes in a house that he had constructed in the suburbs before the Revolution, and where he lived in isolation until his death at the age of almost 92 in August 1843, 15 years after his wife. His only means of living were a small annuity of 1,100 francs, a product of the disposition of his assets, which diminished during the Revolution. After his death, the sale of his furniture only earned 500 francs. Charles Dugast-Matifeux wrote his obituary which appeared in the National de l'Ouest of 13 September 1843.

The replicas were built using traditional shipbuilding techniques.  Collections  The main collection of the museum is the full-size replicas of historic ships on display along the Straits of Magellan. Replicas of weapons and ancient navigation tools are also exhibited as well as copies of documents and books relating to the historic ships and an outdoor shipbuilding workshop.  Replicas  Today the museum has three ship replicas: =Nao Victoria= Nao Victoria, was a carrack, long, wide, that was part of the fleet commanded by Ferdinand Magellan that discovered the waterway around southern tip of the South American continent. Later, commanded by Juan Sebastian Elcano, she was the only ship of the five to complete the first-time circumnavigation of the globe. Commanded by Duarte Barbosa, Nao Victoria participated in the Discovery of Chile, being the first to explore the region in 1520, and discovering or naming Patagonia, Cape Virgenes, the Straits of Magellan, Tierra del Fuego, the Pacific Ocean and other milestones. She is one of the most famous ships in history of navigation. =James Caird= James Caird, was a lifeboat of the Endurance, adapted by Harry McNish, and sailed from Elephant Island to South Georgia during Sir Ernest Shackleton's 1916 Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. Many historians consider the feat of the crew of James Caird to be the most impressive of all global navigation. =Schooner Ancud= Ancud was the ship that, under an 1843 mandate of the President of Chile, Manuel Bulnes, claimed the Strait of Magellan on behalf of Chile's newly independent government, building Fort Bulnes. Commander of the schooner was Captain John Williams Wilson. On 31 December 2011, the museum announced the construction of a replica of the schooner in its shipbuilding workshop; the replica Ancud was opened to public on 5 September 2012. =HMS Beagle= , a British Navy brig-sloop, was converted into an exploration vessel. The most famous of her three trips was the second one under the command of Captain FitzRoy. On board was the young Charles Darwin. HMS Beagle remained in the Magellan regi√≥n for almost three years. She is famous for being the ship where Darwin started developing his theory of evolution. The construction of the full-size HMS Beagle replica started in November 2012. Four years later, in November 2016, the museum announced that the vessel was completed.

He was born on March 21, 1840, in Lille, and died June 30, 1914. He was actively involved in the development of Lille, in particular his contributions to the field of urban transport. Biography Alfred Mongy was born March 21, 1840, at Lille in the neighborhood of Treille in Old Lille. Coming from a modest family but being a brilliant student, he entered the municipal services in his hometown aged 20 years in 1860 with the vision of a grand boulevard that would allow urban sprawl outside the ramparts of Lille. The mayor of Lille at the time, Augustus Richeb√© refused to support the project. He directed the construction of many public buildings (schools, institutes, university buildings), and the restoration of the Porte de Paris. Mongy left the municipal services in 1896 and began an independent engineer after four years at the prefectural services. With Arthur Stoclet he pioneered a great project: the breakthrough Grand Boulevard between Lille, Roubaix and Tourcoing. Alfred Mongy is one of the founders in 1900 of the Tramways Company and Northern Railways, which implements the construction of the Grand Boulevard Lille-Roubaix-Tourcoing. The project opened on December 5, 1909, with a Boulevard 50 m wide. This boulevard consisted of two lanes, designed by engineer Leo Francq.

Rosa intended it as an \\"in-between\\" story to accompany his anthology The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck, happening chronologically between chapter 10: \\"The Invader of Fort Duckburg\\" and chapter 11: \\"The Empire-Builder from Calisota\\". The story is set in 1906. The story was first published in the French Uncle Picsou #349; the first American publication was in Uncle Scrooge #332, in August 2004. Plot Scrooge McDuck, along with his sisters Hortense McDuck and Matilda McDuck, are mining for gold in Panama, which has just recently separated from Colombia and become independent. At the same time, the construction of the Panama Canal is underway as a joint operation between Panama and the United States, and President Theodore Roosevelt has personally come to inspect the construction of the Culebra Cut. Scrooge has legal claim to a mountain which stands in the way of the canal, so Roosevelt wants to come into agreement with him so that he can give the mountain to the United States and the construction of the canal can proceed. Roosevelt makes a secret personal deal with Scrooge: he will help Scrooge mine gold faster, so that when his mining has been completed, he can give the mountain away to the United States. To this end, Roosevelt and Scrooge steal an excavator, with which Scrooge can mine a lot faster than with his old pickaxe. The excavator goes out of control, so Roosevelt and Scrooge end up in the lands of the Guyami Indians. Chief Parita, the leader of the Guyami, doesn't trust Scrooge, so Roosevelt makes an agreement with him instead. The Guyami chief is instantly impressed by a visit from \\"the Chief of the United States\\", and entrusts Roosevelt with the location of \\"Gold Hill\\". Roosevelt and Scrooge start mining gold with the excavator, but the mountain collapses from the strain, revealing an ancient pre-Columbian giant jaguar sculpture full of magnificent riches. Scrooge wants to claim all this to himself, while Roosevelt wants to preserve the riches in a museum. They start a fight, but this is cut short when the sculpture becomes loose and falls off the mountain. In Roosevelt's absence, distrust has broken out between the United States and Panama, and a war is about to start. However, the sculpture arrives right into the scene and a war is avoided. As thanks for avoiding a war with Panama, Roosevelt agrees to give Scrooge whatever he wants. Unfortunately, Scrooge passes out from accidentally drinking chicha instead of brandy, so Hortense and Matilda choose for him instead: a teddy bear, which they had seen earlier and thought was cute, and see as an appropriate snub to their brother's worsening greed. Decades after, in the present day, Scrooge rues his possession of the teddy bear as a memento of \\"the worst deal I ever made\\", but when his three grandnephews tell him that Roosevelt's teddy bear is the first of its kind in the world, Scrooge jumps at the chance at putting it in a museum and earning huge profits from entrance fees. Notes This is one of Rosa's most historically accurate stories. *Theodore Roosevelt and Chief Parita of the Guyami are real historical people. Another historical person appearing in the story is General Esteban Huertas, but Rosa needed him to be a villain rather than a hero, so he chose to use his character as a different person, just named \\"General Esteban\\". *The teddy bear was indeed named for Roosevelt, and the first of its kind was sent to him in response to a 1902 political cartoon lampooning his refusal to shoot an American black bear that had already been captured and tied up before he arrived. A toymaker created a stuffed animal and sold it under the name \\"Teddy's bear\\", after receiving Roosevelt's permission to use his name.

The story is told through a combination of narrative and a mix of vernacular and found photography from the personal archives of collectors listed by the author. This young adult book was originally intended to be a picture book featuring photographs Riggs had collected, but on the advice of an editor at Quirk Books, he used the photographs as a guide from which to put together a narrative. Riggs was a collector of photographs, but needed more for his novel. He met Leonard Lightfoot, a well-known collector at the Rose Bowl Flea Market, and was introduced to other collectors. The result was a story about a boy who follows clues from his grandfather's old photographs, tales, and his grandfather's last words which lead him on an adventure that takes him to a large abandoned orphanage on Cairnholm, a fictional Welsh island. The book has been a New York Times best seller. It reached the #1 spot on the Children's Chapter Books list on April 29, 2012, after being on the list for 45 weeks, remaining there until May 20, when it dropped to the fourth spot on the list. Critics have generally praised the book for creative use of vintage photographs in the sepia style and surrealist form, as well as good characterization and settings. Plot As a child, Jacob Magellan Portman has been fascinated with his grandfather Abraham's stories about surviving as a Jew during World War II, running from man-eating monsters, and living with peculiar children in a secret home guarded by \\"a wise old bird\\". As Jacob grows older, he begins to doubt the stories until the arrival of his grandfather's death. Blood-strewn, exhausted, and lying in his back garden on the outskirts of Florida Woods, Abraham's last words are a mystery: \\"...find the bird in the loop on the other side of the old man's grave on September 3, 1940, and tell them what happened.\\" As his grandfather dies, Jacob catches sight of a horrific monster just like the ones described in Abraham's stories. Soon, he starts experiencing trauma and being plagued with nightmares relating to those monsters. Believing their son to be going crazy, Jacob's parents take him to Dr. Golan, a psychiatrist, who suggests that Jacob go to Cairnholm, Wales, the location of his grandfather's children's home to confront the place of his trauma. On his own, Jacob locates and explores the old house only to find it empty and everything caked in dust. According to the local people, the place is haunted and a bomb had killed all its inhabitants many years ago, on September 3, 1940. Sensing a connection, Jacob refuses to give up and returns to the house one more time, where he encounters a mysterious girl who can conjure fire with her hands whom he follows, trying to question her after hearing her call out his grandfather's name. They reach the bogs surrounding the house before Jacob realizes that the people of Cairnholm are different, including the patrons at the inn and his father isn't there. Luckily, a confused Jacob is rescued by the girl from before and an invisible boy, who introduce themselves as Emma Bloom and Millard Nullings respectively. A suspicious Emma holds him captive and brings him to the children's home, where he finds it magically transformed to the paradise of his grandfather's stories, complete with the peculiar children and the \\"wise old bird\\", who is, in fact, the headmistress Miss Alma LeFay Peregrine (named after that well-known raptorial bird of prey the peregrine falcon). There Jacob is also introduced to other peculiar children apart from Emma and Millard: Bronwyn Bruntley, a girl with incredible strength, Claire Densmore, a little girl with an extra mouth at the back of her head, Olive Abroholos Elephanta, a little girl who can levitate, Enoch O'Connor, a boy who can raise the dead by transplanting hearts for a short amount of time, Hugh Apiston, a boy with bees living in his stomach, Fiona Frauenfeld, a girl with an affinity for growing plants, and Horace Somnusson, a boy with prophetic dreams. Shocked and befuddled by the state of the place, Olive and Millard explain that they are currently existing in a time loop, a place where time is constantly reversed and where they all relive the same day every day, September 3, 1940. This is all thanks to Miss Peregrine, a special type of peculiar being known as an ymbryne, one who can shapeshift into birds (namely a peregrine falcon after which she is named) and manipulate time. Apart from keeping them alive (if not the bomb would have killed them), this time loop also protects the peculiar children from being hunted by hollowgast ‚Äî humanoid, tentacle-mouthed creatures that devour peculiars. That experiment occurred in the Siberian tundra, which was marked by a cataclysmic explosion, and from there the hollowgast were born. In addition to hollowgast being a threat, hollows who have consumed enough peculiars are evolved into wights, beings who resemble humans in every aspect save their eyes, which have no pupils. These wights' ultimate goal is to gain power from the peculiars, as well as morph every one of their fellow hollowgast into wights that will rule the world. Soon, Miss Peregrine's former mentor Miss Avocet arrives at the loop mad with grief over the kidnapping of her wards to wights, who have executed their plan of raiding loops. Fearing for the children's safety, Jacob is tasked with the job of reporting any suspicious information going on in the outside world. With his comings and goings, Jacob and Emma begin to develop feelings for each other, as well as get a glimpse into his own peculiar self: he can see the hollows while other peculiars can't, just like his grandfather. Miss Peregrine's fears are confirmed when eyeless sheep bodies begin to pile up, and Martin, a worker in the Cairnholm Local Museum, is killed. Going against Miss Peregrine's orders to not leave the house, Enoch, Bronwyn, Emma, Jacob and Millard escape, and Enoch uses a sheep heart to briefly bring Martin back to life. Martin manages to inform the group of the presence of a wight on the island, but by then it is too late as one appears right behind them along with a hollow companion. To Jacob's shock, he reveals himself to be Dr. Golan, as well as Jacob's family's hired lawn gardener, and Jacob's middle school bus driver. Jacob refuses Golan's offer to join him in finding peculiars, and decides to stay with his friends. Golan sends his hollow after the group, and Emma and Jacob split up from the rest. After a brief scuffle, Jacob kills it with a pair of sheep shears. They make their way back to the orphanage, but discover that Golan has kidnapped Miss Peregrine and Miss Avocet and locked the rest of the children in the house. Dr. Golan warns them not to attempt to rescue Miss Peregrine and leaves the loop, but Millard manages to sneak out invisibly and follow him. Jacob and his friends follow Millard's tracks and find Golan near a lighthouse trying to catch a boat with his other wight comrades. During the process of saving Miss Peregrine, who is trapped in her bird form, Millard is wounded from a gunshot, but Golan is ultimately killed by Jacob. Just then, the other wights arrive and even though they are able to rescue Miss Peregrine, Miss Avocet is taken away. Returning to the orphanage, they find it destroyed, leaving them having to track down the wights and discover how to help Miss Peregrine. It is then Jacob decides to follow his friends and returns to the present to say goodbye to his father, but promises to return when his mission is finished. Guided by only a prophetic dream from Horace, they set sail to find help. Peculiardom Peculiars Otherwise known as syndrigast (a word meaning \\"peculiar spirit\\" in the Old Peculiar language, which is in turn the author's adaptation of Old English, or Anglo- Saxon language), peculiar folk are a branch of humanity possessing a second soul which manifests itself in strange ways such as abnormal characteristics and abilities commonly referred to as peculiarities. Very rarely are peculiar children born to peculiar parents as the essence or gene of peculiarity often skips entire generations, making peculiar population vastly less than that of normal people. Ymbrynes An ymbryne (pronounced IMM-brinn) is a specific kind of female peculiar who can transform into distinct birds, control and manipulate time as she sees fit, and govern the peculiar world. Most essentially, the ability to control time lets these women possess a period of historical time by looping it, creating a potentially eternal sanctuary for peculiars. They often set out into the present-day world to rescue peculiars in dire situations or to search for those without an ymbryne. Ymbryne means \\"revolution\\" or \\"circuit\\" in Old Peculiar. Council of Ymbrynes The Council of Ymbrynes is the official government and law of peculiardom. Their responsibilities include the maintenance of loop order, the writing or amending of laws on a regular basis, and the determination of sentences for those convicted of a crime. Members are not specified. Time loops Time loops are the fabric of the peculiar world, often referred to as peculiardom. Similar to towns, cities, states, and countries, they act as specific locations. Together they create a vast and quite complex world of varying whereabouts and dates only peculiars are able to enter. Within these loops, peculiars live indefinitely without aging or reliving previous experiences, even as the day around them repeats itself. While it may appear to be a form of eternal youth, it is the suspension of time inevitable. In reality, many, if not all, of Miss Peregrine's children are over fifty years old, but the loop detains them as teenagers and small children physically and mentally. A loop must be reset daily or it will collapse, leaving all peculiars within it exposed to the outside world. Aging forward As a result of time loops, those who reside in them may not be able to return to the present day, depending on how long they've been there. In a mere matter of hours outside of the loop, the amount of time evaded will catch up. An example of this is Miss Peregrine's own former ward, a young girl named Charlotte who left the loop while Miss Peregrine was away. She was discovered by police in the mid-1980s and sent to a welfare agency. When Miss Peregrine found her just two days later, she'd already aged thirty-five years. Although she survived the ordeal, the unnatural aging process had caused Charlotte a great deal of mental disorder, and she was sent to live with Miss Nightjar, an ymbryne more suited for her care. The same process of deterioration applies to anything taken out of time loops as another instance was an apple Jacob took back to the inn where he and his father were staying in the present day. He left it on the nightstand next to his bed as he fell asleep that night, but by morning, found it had rotted to the point of disintegrating. Hollowgast A word meaning \\"empty spirit\\". The hollowgast are monsters who feed on peculiars. They were created by a freak-accident in an unethical and illegal experiment conducted by Miss Peregrine's two brothers. Hundreds had joined their cause, and with the aid of misguided but powerful ymbrynes, it was intended to achieve immortality without the limitations of time loops. Instead, it led to a catastrophic collapse that destroyed half of Siberia where the experiment took place. Everyone involved was presumed dead, but their corpses became deformed and crawled back to a lesser, animalistic state of life. Apart from their shadows, hollows are invisible to all but a gifted few including Abraham and Jacob Portman. They are also identified by the groups of large tentacle-like tongues that occupy their grotesquely stretched mouths. It is speculated that this outcome was the result of being reverse-aged to a time before their souls existed, thus the word hollowgast. Their souls having been erased, hollows possess no form of peculiarity and cannot enter time loops. Wights If a hollow consumes enough peculiar souls, its original human form is restored, with the exception of irises and pupils leaving the eyes entirely white. Because of this, peculiars refer to these evolved creatures as wights. They possess no extraordinary abilities but are highly skilled in posing as normal people under multiple identities and can even pass into time loops. Much of their existence revolves around procuring peculiars for remaining hollows to devour. Once they set their eyes on a peculiar child, they will follow them around. As they did with Jacob all the way to the island. Characters Peculiar children *Jacob Magellan Portman ‚Äî A 16-year-old American teenager and the protagonist of the story. Jacob becomes subject to acute stress reaction after witnessing his grandfather's death and claiming that a monster from his grandfather's childhood stories had killed him. Everyone he knows begins to consider him crazy and avoids him. His parents eventually take him to see a psychiatrist, on whose instruction Jacob's dad takes him on a trip to the Welsh island where his grandfather grew up. There, Jacob discovers that the stories of a magical orphanage and both peculiar children and the monster are real. He also learns that the ability to see these monsters is actually an extremely rare peculiarity as they are invisible to all but a few like himself. *Abraham Portman ‚Äî Abraham was Jacob's grandfather who also had the peculiarity of seeing the monsters. He left Miss Peregrine's loop as a young man to join both the war against Germany and the war against the hollowgast, promising to make a home in America for his fellow peculiars. But having started a family of his own during his time in the normal world, he never went back for them. In spite of this, he was still pressured into eradicating hollows, resulting in long, frequent hunting-trips away from his wife and two children, a secret which they took as careless neglect. Over the years, Abraham became a near-stranger to everyone he knew and, in his old age, was killed by one of the very monsters he had fought so valiantly to defeat. Police simply concluded that dementia and an attack by wild animals were the cause of his death. *Emma Bloom ‚Äî Emma is a teenager under Miss Peregrine's care. Her peculiarity manifested in her hands when she was ten years old. They began to glow red, becoming painfully hot to the point of generating fire. Emma had a romantic relationship with Abraham which they maintained even as he went to war until he stopped responding to her letters. After years without replying, Abraham finally wrote her back simply to tell her he could no longer do so because he'd married another woman. Emma became heartbroken and bitter but still mourned him upon learning of his death when his grandson Jacob arrived in Miss Peregrine's time loop. Although she treated Jacob harshly at first, their mutual sorrow for Abraham started a deeply sincere relationship between them. *Millard Nullings ‚Äî Millard is a young adolescent possessing the peculiarity of invisibility which is said to be quite uncommon. He chooses to go about nude to stay fully invisible, but wears clothes at supper on Miss Peregrine's orders. He is also exceptionally well-versed in all things peculiar and, as a hobby, spends much of his time documenting every little detail of the day they live in. *Bronwyn Bruntley ‚Äî A young adolescent possessing super-human strength, Bronwyn is also kindhearted and a loyal friend. She respects and obeys Miss Peregrine more than her fellow wards do, often correcting them and citing rules they're meant to follow, mostly in fear of anyone getting in trouble. The only occasions for which she refuses to cooperate are when she is made to dress lady-like. Before Miss Peregrine took her and her older brother Victor in, Bronwyn discovered her own strength at the age of ten when she snapped their abusive stepfather's neck without actually meaning to. *Enoch O'Connor ‚Äî A young adolescent with the ability to resurrect the dead and bring inanimate objects to life for a limited time by using the extracted organs of other living things. Enoch was born to a family of undertakers and, before moving into time loops, caused tremendous confusion by frequently bringing the dead to life at his father's funeral parlor. He is the least liked of Miss Peregrine's wards as the others are put off by his selfish behavior, negative thinking, and obsession with violence. His previous ymbryne was never specified, nor were his reasons for relocating to Miss Peregrine's loop. *Olive Abroholos Elephanta ‚Äî Olive is the second youngest to Claire and comes across as quite giddy and openly friendly. Her peculiarity renders her lighter than air, making her float freely like a balloon. She has barely any control over it and must always be weighted down or bound to something to keep from floating away. Her most routine means is a pair of heavy leaden shoes. *Hugh Apiston ‚Äî Hugh is a teenager with bees living in his stomach. His peculiarity allows him to communicate with them and command them. *Horace Somnusson ‚Äî Horace is a young adolescent capable of having prophetic dreams, albeit very scarcely. They occur most often as nightmares of events so horrifying, they have a tendency to throw him into bouts of shock. He can be quite a snob and is an extremely passionate follower of fashion, commonly seen in a suit and tie with a top hat and monocle. *Fiona Frauenfeld ‚Äî Fiona is a teenager possessing power over plants. Her peculiarity allows her to manipulate their life and growth and control their movements. She speaks with a thick Irish accent, though she rarely speaks at all, and has a romantic, symbiotic relationship with Hugh. *Claire Densmore ‚Äî The youngest of all Miss Peregrine's wards, Claire also possesses the most grotesque peculiarity in their midst: a second mouth in the back of her head with sharp teeth, hidden beneath her blonde curls. She is typically cheerful but becomes shy and self- conscious when made to dine with others. *Victor Bruntley ‚Äî Miss Peregrine once had many more peculiars under her care, many of whom were killed by the hollowgast, including Bronwyn's older brother Victor. Like Bronwyn, Victor possessed immense physical strength. He left during the loop's early days, claiming he couldn't stand being trapped there; it was a reckless decision which led to his demise. Until his burial when the loop closed, his lifeless body had remained at Miss Peregrine's home, locked away in his bedroom and neatly laid to rest in bed. Some of the children would occasionally sneak in and have Enoch resurrect him, though he always seemed to be in a rush to get back to the afterlife. *The Twins ‚Äî The Twins appear as two short children, wearing sacks on their heads that have holes for the eyes, however without their masks, they have pale gray, scaly skin with gray serpentine eyes and fangs. Not much is known about the Twin's personalities, besides the fact that they are shy and quiet due to the fact that they do not speak to anyone besides each other. Not too much is known about their peculiarity, but in the movie they were capable of turning a Wight into stone with just a glare, similar to Medusa in Greek Mythology. It was believed in the book they had a telepathic bond. Ymbrynes All ymbrynes take on last names which correspond to the type of bird into which they can shapeshift (e.g., Miss Peregrine can turn into a peregrine falcon). * Alma LeFay Peregrine ‚Äî Miss Peregrine is a highly skilled ymbryne and the headmistress of her children's-home. She is a delicate woman who enjoys smoking a pipe and adores her charges, though she can be strict at times. At a very young age, she learned to hone her peculiarity as a student under Miss Avocet. Miss Peregrine's loop is located on the fictional island of Cairnholm, Wales, on September 3, 1940, though it's actually September 2 for the first few hours. * Esmerelda Avocet ‚Äî Miss Avocet is an elderly and wise woman from the mid- Victorian period in England. Having taught most notable ymbrynes to master their craft, she is regarded as near-royalty. Her loop is in Derbyshire on July 15, 1867, but it was invaded by wights and hollowgast, forcing her to flee to Miss Peregrine's loop. * Miss Nightjar ‚Äî Miss Nightjar takes in difficult cases of peculiars. One such case being Miss Peregrine's former ward, Charlotte. Miss Nightjar's loop is in Swansea, Wales on April 3, 1901 and is co-run by Miss Thrush. * Miss Finch ‚Äî Miss Finch has an aunt who is also an ymbryne but prefers to stay in finch form. Their loop is based in London, but the date is not stated. * Millicent Thrush ‚Äî Miss Thrush has a loop in London and is headmistress of a children's home there but also co-runs Miss Nightjar's special-care home. * Miss Kestrel ‚Äî Possibly a rather historical ymbryne. Enoch mentions an old story of her being injured in a road accident. The incident is said to have trapped her in the form of a kestrel for an entire week, leading to the collapse of her loop before she healed. Location and date are not stated. * Balenciaga Wren ‚Äî Miss Wren is the headmistress of a menagerie for peculiar animals. Her loop is based in mainland Wales in a much older, unknown time. * Miss Gannett ‚Äî Miss Gannett has a loop in Ireland, in June of 1770. * Miss Treecreeper ‚Äî Miss Peregrine mentions her name but doesn't remember where or when her loop is based. Non-peculiars * Franklin Portman ‚Äî Jacob's father, Frank, is an unemployed, amateur ornithologist who volunteers at a bird rescue and likes to pass it off as his job. He also spends much of his time writing manuscripts for nature books, though he's never completed one, giving up on his every project midway. His whole life, he's had a rather rough relationship with his own father, Abraham, as he was almost never around. Frank is very protective of his son, but understands his need for room to grow and learn on his own. * Maryann Portman ‚Äî Maryann is Jacob's obsessively materialistic mother and Franklin's wife. She comes from a wealthy family that owns a drugstore company with one hundred and fifteen branches across the state of Florida. While she loves her son and is immensely protective of him, she tends to be more concerned about public image and what people think of them. *Dr. Golan ‚Äî Dr. Golan was one of the many peculiars who supported and participated in the disastrous experiment that created the hollowgast. He is among those who have reached the state of being a wight, a term he disowns as \\"their word.\\" He is a licensed psychiatrist and, in order to uncover information on Miss Peregrine's loop, has been stalking the Portman family for years under many a guise including their yard man, Jacob's middle school bus driver Mr. Barron, and ultimately himself when Jacob begins seeing him for therapy. *Malthus ‚Äî Malthus was once a peculiar and an old friend of Dr. Golan's who also joined the rebellion against the ymbrynes, dying by the results of the experiment designed to overthrow them and reemerging a hollow. He now travels with the restored Golan, devouring peculiars as they discover time loops. For reasons not specified, Golan allowed him to kill Abraham before they could learn the location of Miss Peregrine's loop. From then on, Malthus haunted Jacob, keeping a vigil on him day and night. *Martin Pagett ‚Äî Martin is a part-time but knowledgeable and well-spoken curator of a small museum on Cairnholm, though due to the island's sparse renown and low tourist appeal, they rarely see any patronage. He strikes up a bond with Jacob, giving him a rundown of Cairnholm's history and assisting him in learning how the children's home was destroyed. Martin plays an unwitting but vital role in discovering Malthus and Dr. Golan on the island. *Oggie ‚Äî Oggie is Martin's uncle, whom he introduces to Jacob in order to help him learn more about the fallen children's home. Elderly and gruff but still sharp of wit, Oggie recalls the strange children and their reclusive headmistress and recounts the bombing in detail, occasionally veering off into rants on the weather and politics. Though he longed to fight for his country, he was too young then and merely watched it all take place. * Susan Portman ‚Äî Susan is Frank's younger sister and Jacob's aunt. While going through Abraham's possessions with them after his passing, she found his copy of The Selected Works of Ralph Waldo Emerson and that he had written a brief well-wish to Jacob on the title page. When she gives it to him on his birthday, Jacob unwittingly discovers a letter from Miss Peregrine when it fell out from between the pages. *Ricky ‚Äî Ricky is described as Jacob's best and only friend, though their relationship is more of a deal for personal benefit: in exchange for Jacob helping Ricky with his homework, Ricky acts as Jacob's bodyguard at school. Reception Miss Peregrine's spent seventy weeks on The New York Times Best Sellers list for children's chapter books. It reached the number one spot on the list on April 29, 2012, after being on the list for forty-five weeks. It remained there until 20 May, when it dropped to the fourth spot on the list. The book dropped off the list on September 9, 2012, after sixty-three weeks. According to Deborah Netburn for the Los Angeles Times, the best part of the novel is \\"a series of black-and- white photos sprinkled throughout the book\\". Publishers Weekly called the book \\"an enjoyable, eccentric read distinguished by well-developed characters, a believable Welsh setting, and some very creepy monsters.\\" Sequels A sequel, titled Hollow City, was released on January 14, 2014. The novel is set immediately after the first, and sees Jacob and his friends fleeing from Miss Peregrine's to the \\"peculiar capital of the world\\", London. The third installment in the Miss Peregrine's series, titled Library of Souls, was announced in early 2015. It was released on September 22, 2015. A Map of Days, the first installment of a new trilogy set in the United States and featuring the main protagonists from the original trilogy, was released on October 2, 2018 by Dutton Books for Young Readers (a division of Penguin Group).https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/557311/a-map-of-days-by- ransom-riggs/ On January 14, 2020, the fifth installment, The Conference of the Birds, was released.

As a youth, he worked as a coal miner while playing local-league football. He played for several non- League clubs before joining Notts County in 1929. Over the following ten years, Robinson played for five different Football League sides and made a total of 169 appearances. He later worked as a coach in the Netherlands before emigrating to Canada in later life. Biography Robinson was born on 21 January 1908 in the mining village of Shiney Row, County Durham and worked as a collier before becoming a professional footballer. In 1985, after retiring from work, he emigrated to Canada. Robinson died in Vancouver in 1991. Football career While working as a miner, Robinson played for his village club Shiney Row Swifts, and later assisted Houghton Colliery Welfare. In June 1926, he signed as an amateur with North Eastern League club Shildon, where he spent one season. The following summer he joined Midland Football League side York City, initially on amateur terms. Robinson was awarded a professional contract in August 1928 and made a total of nine league appearances during his two years at Fulfordgate. In May 1929, he was signed by Notts County of the Football League Second Division, but he failed to play in a first-team fixture for the club. Robinson left Notts County at the end of the 1929‚Äì30 season and joined Third Division North club Nelson in June 1930. He was signed to replace Ted Ferguson, who had departed to Annfield Plain during the summer. Robinson made his Nelson debut in the opening match of the 1930‚Äì31 campaign, a 4‚Äì5 defeat away at Rochdale, and kept his place in the side for 28 consecutive matches. However, the club struggled during that time, recording only five wins and suffering heavy defeats to Tranmere Rovers (1‚Äì7) and Southport (1‚Äì8).Dykes (2009), p. 84 He was dropped for the trip to New Brighton on 24 January 1931 in favour of Gilbert Richmond, who retained his starting place for the next three games. Robinson returned for two matches during February 1931 but again lost his place to Richmond, who shared right-back duties with Harry Counsell over the remainder of the season. The following month, Robinson left Nelson in order to join Northampton Town on trial. After an unsuccessful trial spell at Northampton, Robinson returned to non-League football with Southern League outfit Tunbridge Wells Rangers. In July 1932 he signed for Barnsley, where he made 23 league appearances during the 1932‚Äì33 season. Robinson moved to First Division club Sheffield United for a transfer fee of ¬£750 in the summer of 1933. After playing 17 league matches for the Bramall Lane side, he found himself surplus to requirements and was sold to Carlisle United in August 1934 for ¬£175, less than a quarter of the fee paid the previous year. Robinson was an ever-present for Carlisle throughout the 1934‚Äì35 campaign, appearing in all 38 league fixtures. Despite this, he moved clubs again in August 1935 and signed for Lincoln City on a free transfer. Robinson spent more than four years at Sincil Bank, making 64 league appearances, before his career was brought to an end by the outbreak of the Second World War. After the war, he worked as a football coach in the Netherlands with Enschede.

On the other hand, his short films earned him a harvest of prestigious prizes: Le Haricot, (Palme d'Or du court m√©trage at Cannes in 1963)http://www.festival-cannes.fr/fr/archives/ficheFilm/id/3109.html and Toine (C√©sar du meilleur court m√©trage in 1981). Most especially, he belongs to the small French circle to have won Oscars in Hollywood, in 1960 with Histoire d'un poisson rouge (The Golden Fish), produced by Cousteau, in the category Academy Award for Live Action Short Film, and in 1975 with Les borgnes sont rois (One-Eyed Men Are Kings), in collaboration with Michel Leroy, produced by Paul Claudon. Edmond S√©chan is the uncle of French singer Renaud. Renaud and his brother make an appearance in the Red Balloon, a movie in which S√©chan worked as director of photography.

The film is based on a novel of the same name. Plot Lalu (Rosalind Chao) is a young Chinese woman who is sold by her impoverished family and transported against her will to the American West in 1880. Upon her arrival in California, she meets Jim (Dennis Dun), a Chinese \\"wife trader\\" who sells her to Hong King (Michael Paul Chan), a successful Chinese merchant who lives in an Idaho mining town. The two set off on the long journey to Idaho and eventually strike up a friendship along the way. When they finally arrive in the rough, isolated town, she is distraught to discover that she is not going to be Hong King's wife. Instead, she is to work in his saloon as his newest prostitute under a new name, \\"China Polly\\". She is further dismayed when Jim abruptly disappears, leaving her to fend for herself. The following night, when Hong King tries to sell her virtue to the highest bidder, Lalu violently refuses to submit to her would-be suitors and successfully avoids becoming a prostitute, thanks in part to the intervention of a kind stranger, Charlie Bemis (Chris Cooper), who turns out to be Hong King's Caucasian partner. She placates a furious Hong King and convinces him to allow her to be his servant and saloon maid in order to repay the cost of her purchase. Hong King agrees to let her buy her freedom for the impossible sum of a thousand pieces of gold. Polly, as Lalu comes to be known, endures great hardship. At one point, she is sexually assaulted by Hong King. However, she refuses to give up. She works hard and makes friends with the local townspeople. She also grows closer to Charlie, who begins to fall deeply in love with her. Meanwhile, Hong King is beset with financial problems and decides to sell Polly to the highest bidder. In a rare stroke of luck, Charlie wins her in a game of poker. She moves in with him but insists they remain platonic and keep separate quarters. Jim comes back and wants her to be with him but he then leaves her again when he finds out that she is living with Charlie. The \\"white demons\\" begin to run out the Chinese people from their town so it will be a purely white town and the Chinese will stop getting all of the gold. Polly works in many jobs and saves money to go back to China and her family, but ultimately ends up falling in love with Charlie. She marries him and lives the rest of her life with him in a different area so she will not be harassed by the white demons anymore.

In 2013 Don Smith died at age 89. 1951‚Äì1989 Between 1956 and 1968, EllisDon computerized its accounting and cost control systems, and operated a purchased tower crane ‚Äì the first construction company in Canada to do both. In 1971, EllisDon launched a Corporate Safety Strategy to improve job site safety. Between 1974 and 1976, the company expanded, establishing operations in Edmonton, Alberta and in Saudi Arabia. Since then EllisDon has expanded its current operations to its offices around the world. Once EllisDon was awarded the Construction Management Contract for the Metro Toronto Convention Centre project in 1982, it moved on to build the SkyDome (renamed Rogers Centre in 2005). This project was completed in 1989, and was the world's first retractable rooftop stadium. 1990‚Äì2003 In 1990, EllisDon established the construction industry's first freestanding Research and Development Department. Following that, EllisDon in 1993 became the first Canadian company to build in Latvia and Lithuania following the removal of the Iron Curtain in the USSR. In 1997, EllisDon completed its first project in Malaysia. In 1996, Don Smith's son, Geoff Smith ‚Äì who joined the company as a full-time employee in 1982 ‚Äì became EllisDon's President and CEO. 2004‚Äìpresent In 2004, EllisDon participated in a new hospital funding model, a public-private partnership (PPP) with the $450 million William Osler Health Centre in Brampton, Ontario. EllisDon delivered Toronto's MaRS (Medical and Related Services) Convergence Centre (Building B) in 2005. In 2008, EllisDon completed construction and installation work in the Dubai Waterfront, the largest waterfront development of its kind in the world. In 2010, EllisDon completed Winnipeg International Airport Terminal Building, Canada's first LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified airport terminal. In June 2016, EllisDon launched The Carbon Impact Initiative Action PlanThe Carbon Impact Initiative Action Plan in support of Canada‚Äôs international climate change commitments. Industry executives, in collaboration with government leaders, established the initiative outlining strategies to transform the market toward a low-carbon economy. Mohawk College‚Äôs Joyce Centre for Partnership and Innovation BuildingMohawk College‚Äôs Joyce Centre for Partnership and Innovation Building is Ontario‚Äôs first net- zero institutional building as well as the first pilot project under the Carbon Impact Initiative. In March 2018, EllisDon acquired the interests of joint venture partner Carillion (in liquidation in the UK) in four Ontario hospital projects, becoming the sole service provider at Royal Ottawa Hospital, Oakville-Trafalgar Memorial Hospital, Brampton Civic Hospital and Sault Area Hospital.

Such works can be classified as structural art when they attain excellence in the three areas of efficiency, economy, and elegance, as defined by Prof. David P. Billington of Princeton University. A key part of the concept of structural art is that the structural engineer making the design must exercise his or her creativity and playfulness to create an elegant structure within the constraints imposed by engineering requirements. These constraints include the safety and serviceability of the structure. Therefore, a structure cannot be a successful work of structural art without also being a successful work of structural engineering design, yet many works of structural engineering design that are safe and serviceable do not rise to the level of structural art because they fail to be economical, efficient, or elegant. Structural art is a topic of active scholarly research at several universities in the United States, including Princeton University, Tufts University, Bucknell University, University of Massachusetts Amherst, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Roger Williams University, and in other parts of the world such as Spain (Universitat Polit√©cnica de Val√®ncia) and Germany (HCU Hamburg). While structural artists often collaborate with architects, the discipline of structural art is based upon engineering rather than architectural design. A recent summary about this topic can be found in a review paper Origin of the concept The idea of structural art as a creative subdiscipline of structural engineering originates from the scholarship of Prof. David P. Billington of Princeton University. The term appears to have been coined in his 1983 book The Tower and the Bridge, and arose out of scholarly study of great works of structural design made by engineers starting in the late 18th century with the beginning of the wide availability of iron as a structural material. Much of the impetus for the idea came from the personal and professional writings of engineers such as Thomas Telford, John Roebling, and Robert Maillart, among others, who wrote of the conscious way they attempted to create aesthetically pleasing, imaginative, and elegant structures, while meeting safety and serviceability requirements. A theme uniting many of the foundational structural artists is that they either were builders themselves (John Roebling) or had a builder's mentality (Fazlur Khan). Other scholars of structural engineering design have published works that can be considered part of the body of knowledge on structural art. Notable among these is Alan Holgate The three S's and E's It is also said that a work of structural art should be interpreted in terms of the 'Three S's'; the scientific, social, and symbolic meaning: *Scientific: How is the structure designed to safely transmit loads to the ground? What materials are used, and how much is used? *Social: What were the short and long term costs of the structure to society? What role does the structure play in the functioning of society? *Symbolic: What feelings does the structure inspire? What meaning does the structure carry for its users? An example of three specific ideas related to the three S's are the 'Three E's'. A work of structural art must excel in efficiency, economy, and elegance, often referred to as the 'Three E's': *Efficiency: The use of the minimum amount of material needed to ensure that the structure safely performs its function. *Economy: Avoidance of excessive monetary cost in the design, construction, operating and decommissioning costs of a structure. Economy should be evaluated in terms of the life-cycle cost of the structure whenever possible. *Elegance: The structural form should be aesthetically pleasing, but should be defined and driven by engineering considerations. Thus, an elegant design is not simply one that is pleasing, but one that arises from engineering creativity, satisfies the requirements of efficiency and economy, and is also pleasing. Professor Billington has also put forth in his lectures that works of structural art involve imagination, inspiration, and innovation - though this categorization is not found in his formal writings. Structural artists and great works Some of the structural artists who essentially defined the art form by their own works include: Thomas Telford, Gustav Eiffel, John Roebling, Othmar Ammann, Robert Maillart, Christian Menn, Heinz Isler, Fazlur Khan, Felix Candela, Pier Luigi Nervi, Eduardo Torroja, Eladio Dieste. Some of the great works of structural art include: Menai Straits Bridge, Craigellachie Bridge, Eiffel Tower, Brooklyn Bridge, George Washington Bridge, Verrazano Narrows Bridge, Salginatobel Bridge, Ganter Bridge, Sicli Company Building, John Hancock Center, Los Manantiales Restaurant at Xochimilco, Little Sports Palace. Contrast with architecture Structural art is distinct from architecture primarily in that the constraints under which structural artists practice are very different from those under which architects practice. Structural artists, while seeking elegance, must satisfy safety and serviceability, efficiency and economy, and usage needs. Architects are somewhat freer in making designs, constrained primarily by usage needs. Gateway Arch, a successful work of architecture Eiffel Tower, a successful work of structural art Eero Saarinen's Gateway Arch and the Eiffel Tower provide a contrast that illustrates the difference between structural art and architecture. The Gateway arch is widely thought to be a highly successful work of architecture, and the Eiffel Tower is recognized as a work of structural art. Both structures must primarily resist wind loads yet have very different forms. The Eiffel Tower has been shown to be the near optimal form for resisting wind loads, and therefore is more in line with the ideals of structural art than architecture. The Gateway Arch succeeds as a work of architecture and does not meet the ideals of efficiency and economy. Criticism and differing views of structural design Contemporary scholarly debate regarding the definition of structural art continues to develop and advance the concept. Two areas in which such debate is occurring are the inclusion of a temporal aspect in the evaluation of structural art, and inclusion of the sustainability of a design. Regarding the temporal aspect, it has been argued that the time-dependent concept of a design process is missing from the conventional definition of structural art. This feature of a design can arise particularly regarding construction, when economy of time is an important consideration. Though sustainability of a design is not explicitly included in the current definition of structural art, it can be argued that a design that succeeds in efficiency, economy, and elegance will be sustainable, provided that evaluations of the 'Three E's' consider life-cycle performance of the structure. Probably the most elaborated critique on structural art was given in where according to Mentor Llunji, the author of the book, widely accepted definition of structural art is considered counterproductive because imposes trivial limitations on developing the real structural engineering artistry.

He was the most influential member of the firm of Venetian printers, the House of Scotto, which existed from the late 15th century until 1615. At its peak in the 1560s, the Scotto firm under Girolamo was one of the preeminent publishing firms of Europe, producing volumes on law, scholasticism, philosophy, medicine, theology, and ancient literature in addition to music. Only the firm of Gardano produced more books of music in the 16th century than the House of Scotto under Girolamo; over half of Scotto's publications, 409 out of approximately 800 in total, were books of music.Jane Bernstein, \\"Scotto: 3, Girolamo Scotto\\". Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online (accessed 1 January 2012). Life and work Girolamo was one of six children of Bernardino Scotto, of Milan (1447‚Äì1537).Bernstein, 31 Born in Milan, his early life is undocumented, and prior to the first appearance of his name on a Scotto- published book in 1539, his name appears only once in the historical record: in a petition to the Venetian Senate dated 1536 requesting a printing privilege for a work of scholastic philosophy by Marcantonio Zimara on Averroes' commentaries on Aristotle.Bernstein, 42 He married Cesaria Sinistri, who survived him, as she was the executor of his will; they probably had no children.Bernstein, 47 Most likely he was involved in the firm during the 1530s, learning both the craft and the trade. Some Scotto-published books of madrigals of Philippe Verdelot ‚Äì dated 1536 and 1538 ‚Äì show idiosyncrasies associated with Girolamo's later work, and may have been typeset by him.Bernstein, 43 In 1539 Girolamo took over operation of the family business from his brother Ottaviano II. While Ottaviano lived until at least 1566, he seems to have had little further control over the firm, although he continued to publish. In her book on the Scotto firm, Jane Bernstein suggests that Ottaviano may have been ill, since he made two separate wills in the 1540s; he also may have preferred to devote his time to his other interests, such as philosophy and medicine, happily giving over the business aspect of the publishing house to his younger brother. Girolamo acquired control of the publishing house at a singularly opportune time. Venice was entering into a several-decade-long period of peace and prosperity, and capitalist, commercial enterprises were doing well. There was an enormous demand for madrigals, a relatively new musical form proving immensely popular in Italy, and through the technological advance of single-impression music printing ‚Äì in which blocks of type imprinted a portion of staff along with a note ‚Äì Girolamo was able to mass-produce music to meet the market demand. In addition to producing music books he also continued the firm's tradition of publishing other subjects, such as philosophy, medicine, law, theology, and other matters, and all the while composing and publishing his own music.Bernstein, 4‚Äì5, 45 The Scotto and Gardano firms together formed an effective monopoly on the publishing industry not only in Venice, but in all of Italy. Gardano, unlike Scotto, published only music. Rather than compete fiercely, as Gardano did with a small firm in Ferrara, the two houses worked together more often than not, often borrowing from each other, seemingly having worked out an understanding that both houses could profit from their arrangement. In the 33 years of their domination of the Italian market, Scotto produced over 800 publications ‚Äì approximately a complete print run of a new book or set of music parts every two weeks. Mary S. Lewis, \\"Gardano: 1, Antonio (Antoine) Gardano\\". Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online, (accessed 2 January 2012). Having the monopoly, a healthy market for his products, and a network of booksellers throughout Italy and Sicily, Scotto acquired considerable wealth during the middle decades of the 16th century. Tax records, and his will, mention his ownership of numerous rental properties and cultivated fields, many in the vicinity of Padua. In 1571 he was elected as priore to the Venetian Guild of Printers and Booksellers, which included in its membership all of the notable figures in the business in Venice. Girolamo died on 23 September 1573, and was buried in the monastic church of San Francesco della Vigna in Venice.Bernstein, 46‚Äì47 On Girolamo's death in 1572, the Scotto firm passed to Girolamo's heir, his nephew Melchiorre Scotto. On Melchiorre's death in 1613, it was dissolved and its assets put up for public auction since Melchiorre's designated heir was considered by the Venetian authorities to be illegitimate.Bridges, 87 Music Scotto's music, all secular and vocal, was written for his market, and was largely didactic. He wrote 220 compositions which he published himself, many of them madrigals for two or three voices. Two-voice madrigals were a relative rarity at the time, but useful for teaching, and for amateurs; most madrigals were for four or five voices. Stylistically they kept up with current trends, and he probably learned from the composers whose works he published; in fact he sometimes paraphrased their work in his own. One of his compositions was a setting of Petrarch's sonnet Padre del ciel, doppo i perduti giorni. This serious work, a sonnet of contrition and renunciation emblematic of the Counter-Reformation, was set by only one other composer: the renowned Cipriano de Rore.Einstein, 401 Notes References * Bernstein, Jane.

Plot Major Terry O'Neill (William Powell) returns to Baltimore in 1919, after the end of World War I, expecting to get his old newspaper night editor job back. However, the paper has recently changed owners, the job has been filled, and his friend and former editor, Allan Smith (an uncredited Will Wright), has been told to cut costs. Disillusioned, Terry decides to abandon his ideals and make his fortune by whatever means necessary. Leaving the building, he runs into two less-than-savory friends, \\"Fishface\\" (Rags Ragland) and \\"Three Finger\\" (Frank McHugh). When the pair are arrested for bookmaking, it takes all his money to pay their fines and that of \\"Snarp\\" (James Gleason). He crashes a high society wedding party in the hope of meeting businessman Lewis J. Malbery (Henry O'Neill). When a guard insists on seeing his invitation, Terry grabs guest Kay Lorrison (Esther Williams) and kisses her, much to her surprise. After the guard goes away, she slaps Terry in the face, but after his honest confession, begins to warm to him. She introduces him to her uncle, publisher Joe Lorrison (Charles Trowbridge). Terry impresses him with his ideas on how to fight a bitter foe - none other than Malbery - and lands a job. He and Kay, who works on occasion at the paper, develop a relationship. After masterminding a skillful newspaper campaign against Malbery, Terry surprises his boss by quitting his relatively low-paying job to go to work for Malbery in New York. Snarp, Fishface, Three Finger and \\"Eel\\" (Slim Summerville) tag along and open a pool room. When after three years, Malbery promotes him to executive vice president of the company, he returns to Baltimore to see Kay. He finds her once again at a wedding. To his dismay, however, she informs him that this time she is the bride. Nightclub singer \\"Dusty\\" Millard (Angela Lansbury) gets him on the rebound. After a while, Terry crosses paths with Kay once more. She is a widow, and interested in picking up where they left off. Dusty gives up, realizing she has no chance against her rival. However, Kay learns that Terry has become hard and cynical. When Snarp's bookmaking operation was uncovered, his disreputable pals appealed to Terry; he secretly had Snarp freed, but saw to it that his good fortune was attributed to Saint Dismas. Terry loses everything in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Nearly all his friends and associates, who invested in the stock market on his advice, make him a scapegoat. The only exceptions are Snarp and Dusty. A reformed Snarp tries to get Terry to put his faith in Saint Dismas, without success. Dusty offers Terry an expensive bracelet he once gave her, but he turns her down. Embittered by the rejection, she takes over a charity Snarp set up dedicated to Saint Dismas, intending to steal the donations and place the blame on Terry. When Terry leaves town on business, he falls ill and is cared for by Father Nolan (Lewis Stone). Snarp comes to see him to tell him what Dusty and their old associates are doing. Then a concerned Kay shows up. Terry drives into town to plead with Dusty to return the money. Dusty and the others are unmoved at first, but when they see how sincere he is, Dusty gives it all back, and more.

A massive network of constructed pre-Columbian roads and trails have been well documented across the Americas, and in many places remnants can still be found of trails used by hunters and gatherers. One unique characteristic of the trail marker tree is a horizontal bend several feet off the ground, which makes it visible at greater distances, even in snow. Even today, modern hunters look for horizontal shapes while hunting deer, elk, and moose. Dr. Janssen noted in 1941: Large trees that exhibit deformed growth and distinctive forms bent in a vertical plane are sometimes labeled trail trees, marker trees, thong trees, or signal trees by enthusiasts. Historically, these unique trees were commonly known as Indian trail trees. Proponents of trail tree lore claim these unique forms are culturally modified trees used to mark trails or important places. Distinctively bent trees have long been noted throughout the Temperate Deciduous Forest of eastern North America. The extent to which indigenous peoples used such trees as navigational aids, and whether such trees were formed by anthropogenic or natural means is controversial. These distinctively shaped trees have been photographed and documented in the Great Lakes Region by scientists and historians since the early 1800s. Examples of documented trail marker trees The trail tree known as first oak trail marker tree near Monterey, Tennessee, is one of two trail marker trees on private property near Monterey, Tennessee. The town of Monterey was originally named Standing Stone. Traditional Native American ceremonies are still held to honor the standing stone in Monterey. The trail tree known as white oak marker tree in Traverse City, Michigan, is a traditional trail marker tree and has been protected by the people of Traverse City for decades. This tree is in Traverse City Park, one of two that stood in the park. This remaining tree has been protected by the local historians. There have been ceremonies performed at the tree and a wrought iron fence has been erected to protect this treasured landmark. The trail marker tree in White County, Indiana, is one of two enormous white oak trail marker trees in the county and is estimated to be over 350 years old. These trees are on private property, cared for and protected by the homeowners and assisted by the community out of respect to the Native Americans. In an article published by The Indiana Historian, September 2001, a Miami elder and teacher spoke \\"that there are fewer than a handful of these 'Trail Trees' left in Indiana today. These special gifts were made for our People as they journeyed to find their way back home to the loved ones in the circle. Intentionally bent, this magnificent tree still stands.\\"The Indiana Historian, September 2001 In regards to this historic tree, a Native American in White County named Buffalo Heart referred to the ancient tree as \\"Grandfather\\" and recounted numerous trail marker trees throughout White County from her childhood. Much of the early research in this area in Indiana was by historian Marilyn Abbott, according to Madden and Dold in the 175th anniversary of White County. The trail tree known as trail marker tree in Michigan was shaped in 1930 at the direction of park designer Herbert F. Larson Sr. by two Ojibwe men: \\"When Larson asked the two Indian men to retrace the old trail, Larson would have insisted (by his known interest in Ojibwe culture), that they mark the trail in Indian fashion rather than by cemented rock stanchions or metal rebar.\\"Otchingwanigan, Earl and Christie (September 2, 2011). Native American Indian Trail Marker Trees: Collaborative Evidence Concerning Two Recently Discovered Trees in Iron County, Michigan. pp. 3-4. Anthropogenic interpretation Proponents of trail tree lore believe that a widespread cultural practice among northeastern and southeastern groups of indigenous peoples of the Americas placed sign posts in the North American wilderness by intentionally bending and securing selected saplings to force deformed growth oriented to indicate directions to resources or along trails. Each manipulated sapling was intended to survive, to grow large and to retain its shape becoming part of an extensive land and water navigational system designed to help them find their way in wild landscapes throughout forested areas of North America. This navigational system is presumed to have been already in place before the arrival of the first Europeans. Trail marker trees provided a form of land and water navigation originating from Native American tribes throughout North America. Trail marker trees designated areas of significant importance to Native Americans including council circles and gathering points. A well defined council circle, the Greensky Council Trees still exists to this day shaped by the Odawa tribe in 1830 and is located in Northern Michigan. They altered the trees in traditional Odawa fashion to mark the location: to honor this location that had been and would continue to be sacred to their people. Each of these trees takes a sharp bend away from the center of the circle at a height of eight feet and then turns up again; a dramatic and elegant designation. The first report of trail marker trees, in what is now the State of Illinois, appeared in a document called Map of Ouilmette Reservation with its Indian Reminders dated 1828‚Äì1844. This map shows actual drawings and locations of existing trail marker trees. Even after the indigenous population was removed in the 1830s by the Indian Removal Act, pioneers in this area kept the knowledge of the trail marker trees alive by direct contact with many Northwest Territory tribes. At the beginning of the 1900s, articles, books, special events, and installation of bronze plaques at known Indian trail tree sites began to appear. These historic trees were now becoming recognized as historically significant landmarks for navigation presumed shaped and used by Native Americans. The first recorded plaque was dedicated by the Chicago Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution on May 6, 1911 at the northernmost edge of Cook County, Illinois. There are eleven similarly shaped trees in succession pointing the direction of the Indian trails near the famous Green Bay Trail. Recorded in the original Federal survey of 1838, on the narrow path from Chicago to Milwaukee, two identifiable trail marker trees once stood clearly marking the route north. The abundance of trail marker trees in the Great Lakes region was a direct result of its central location and need to navigate between the Great Lakes, dense forests and river systems that existed in this area. Trail marker trees served Indigenous Americans as they traveled the river systems and lakes, acting as points of exit to portage routes or trails. In the Illinois Country, later part of the Northwest Territory, this custom of shaping the trees by hand was passed on directly from the local tribes to the North American fur trade inhabiting this region from the 1700s. These culturally altered living landmarks appeared in several forms, each conveying a distinctive message to their creator. Trail marker trees differed from tribe to tribe. Their uses varied from pointing out a fresh water source off a main route, to indicating exposed deposits of flint, copper, lead and other mineral resources that may have been important to Native American for medicinal and ceremonial purposes, including the shaping of council circles. This system was also used to exit rivers and creeks at portage points or link them to other major trails. A trail marker tree high on a river bank was easily visible, even during floods, which occurred often. Native Americans chose trees mainly from the hardwood family in their region. They most commonly shaped Oak and maple trees‚Äîdue to their flexibility when young, and their permanence and ability to retain shape. They bent trees over to form an arch, and secured them to a stake in the ground or tied them to a large stone with a leather strap or vine. They left a new branch to grow skyward from the top of the arch, forming a new trunk. Eventually they removed the old trunk, leaving a knob, a distinctive characteristic of trail marker trees. In a culture based on hunting and gathering, the hunter was trained from childhood to recognize horizontal shapes in the forest in hopes that it was wild game. The distinctive horizontal characteristic made the trail marker tree easily recognizable. The shape itself not only stood out horizontally in a vertical world at approximately the height of game, but also was visible above snowfall in the Great Lakes region. Controversy Controversy has followed trail tree lore since the beginnings of its popularity early in the Twentieth Century. One early protest, in the form of a letter to the editor of the Chicago Record- Herald dated November 10, 1911 presents points of contention that should be considered today. George H. Holt objected to the placement and dedication of a bronze tablet at the site of a deformed tree claimed to be an Indian Trail Tree and adopted by his community November 7, 1911. Following publishing of Holt's letter, Valentine Smith, Head Regent of the Fort Dearborn Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, offered a rebuttal, citing authorities who supported the plaque. Holt wrote: :\\"To the Editor: The erection of a bronze tablet to mark \\"The Indian Trail Tree\\" at Glencoe ought not to pass unchallenged. It may be a pity to spoil a petty conceit, but it is much worse to invent a historical incident and to commemorate it by a tablet which must always discredit the perpetrators, the intelligence of the period and the trustworthiness of history. :I personally remember the time when that tree was erect and when a whirlwind or severe wind passed over that section and split and bent the tree at the fork, leaving a portion of it still erect and the broken portion of it as it is today, the only change being that the tree has grown. Other trees were broken and uprooted at the same time. The attention of many persons was attracted to this particular tree because it was close to the railroad and because it survived the shock, and it became a matter of interest from year to year to note whether the broken portion of the tree would continue to live. There are probably many persons living along the north shore who remember the incident. :If there were no living witnesses to the incident, the theory advanced would be indefensible upon three grounds: :First‚ÄîA tree does not grow upward in the manner assumed by the inventor of the \\"discovery.\\" The broken portion of the tree is at the same height today as it was when it was broken. Most people know that a tree does not grow upward as a man grows. :Second‚ÄîAny Indian who was so ignorant of woodcraft as to conceive of marking a trail by bending over a limb and fastening it to the ground in the manner indicated in this tablet, would have been the laughing stock of every other Indian. :Third‚ÄîThere was a practicable road traveled by horses and teams, between Milwaukee and Chicago, within plain sight of this \\"Trail Tree\\" eighty years ago, and there were other settlers along that road from whom the Indians might have inquired the way, if they had lost it. The configuration of the country is such that no Indian, even a hundred years ago or more, would have thought of using a trail running in the direction indicated, because it would lead him into rough and heavily wooded country, traversed by ravines and leading nowhere, when he could far more easily have followed the sand ridge and kept out of the woods and the mud. :There are many other reasons which might be given for discrediting this invention of a historical event that never happened and commemorating it with a tablet that must occasion ridicule as long as it exists. - George H. Holt.\\" The following is Valentine Smith's rebuttal. Her letter mentions 'authorities' on the subject, such as Frank R. Grover of the Evanston Historical Society, and Jens Jensen (landscape architect), a well known landscape architect at the time and spokesperson at the Blackstone Hotel for the unveiling of the tablet on May 6, 1911. Valentine Smith wrote: :\\"Trail Tree\\" Tablet. Chicago, Nov 15. :To the Editor: As chairman of the committee of the Chicago Daughters of the American Revolution which erected this bronze table, I have decided to reply to the criticisms of George H. Holt. :Mr. Holt stands alone in his contentions. I think he must have mistaken the tree, because his memory would be almost superhuman if he ever saw the pointing branch of that tree stand upright. We have not acted without consulting authorities. Frank R. Grover, vice president of the Evanston Historical Society, read a paper on Indian trail markers before the Chicago Historical Society on Feb. 21, 1905. His paper can be found on pages 267-8 of the publication of that society. He said that at various points along the north shore, following the old Indian trails, trees were still to be found which had evidently been bent and tied down as saplings to mark the Indian trails. The trees, he said, were invariably large, which indicated that they had been bent over a century ago. One of the trees he mentioned was selected by the committee to support the tablet. :The \\"pointing branch' of this tree was not broken, but bent. The fiber of the wood leaves no doubt of this fact. The same even curve to be observed in the fiber was to be discerned in the bark before relic hunters stripped it bare. A whirlwind would not have left the tree in this condition. :Mr. Holt is evidently unaware of the existence of three other trees along the same trail from Lakeside station south to Hubbard's woods. Each tree has its pointing branch and all are white elms. They are arranged so systematically that they tell their own story. Moreover, the use of \\"trail\\" trees so marked is not doubted by Jens Jensen a member of the outer park belt commission, City Forester Prost and other experts.\\" George H. Holt was the only person to voice an opinion against the trail marker tree research. He was in the lumber business, so he may have had other reasons for not wanting trees identified as historic trail marker trees. Trail tree located in north Georgia, USA, individual is approximately six feet. Trees growing new leaders from storm-broken branches high up may obtain odd appearances and are sometimes misinterpreted as intentionally modified trees expected to grow and raise the modification high into the air where it can be easily seen by passersby. Injury and injury response remain at the height of the original injury for the life of the tree.

He was one of a group of influential academic architects in the 1820s and 1830s that furthered the precepts of Percier and Fontaine, although little of his own work survives.Mead 1996.  Early life and training  Born in Paris, Fran√ßois Debret was the son of Jacques Debret, criminal court clerk of the Parliament of Paris. He was the younger brother of Jean-Baptiste Debret. In 1808, he married a sister of the architect F√©lix Duban. Their son, Francis, born in 1809, graduated from the French Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts (Academy of Fine Arts). Around 1793 Debret studied with Charles Percier.  Career  In 1813, Debret succeeded Jacques Cellerier as the architect in charge of restoring the Basilica of Saint-Denis near Paris. His work there demonstrated a lack of understanding of gothic architecture. He supervised the trimming of stone from the church's flying buttresses, causing dangerous structural weakness; carried out the removal of authentic ornamentation; and added the anachronistic Gallery of Kings to the west facade. Already condemned by medievalists, he rebuilt the spire of the facade's north tower, after it was struck by lightning in 1837. The new spire was too heavy, jeopardizing the structural integrity of the facade. Relieved of his post in 1846 due to incompetence, he was succeeded by Eug√®ne Viollet- le-Duc, who took down the spire in 1847. The disputes over Debret's designs for the church furthered the Gothic Revival in France.Curl 2006, p. 228. In 1818‚Äì1819, he was assigned the task of transforming the former Augustinian convent in Paris into the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, which had been revived in 1816 under the Bourbon Restoration. Debret supervised the construction of the serviceable B√¢timent des Loges (1822‚Äì1828) and built the foundation and south wing of the Palais des √âtudes (started in 1820), but in 1832 was replaced by his former student and brother-in-law, F√©lix Duban, who redesigned it. Debret was more successful with his theatre designs. After restoring Nicolas Lenoir's Th√©√¢tre de la Porte Saint-Martin in 1818, he remodeled the acoustically well- regarded auditorium of Victor Louis's Th√©√¢tre des Arts in 1819. His changes included raising the ceiling by replacing the original Ionic capitals with Corinthian. In 1820 he was commissioned to design the temporary opera house, the Salle Le Peletier, in which he essentially rebuilt the auditorium of the Th√©√¢tre des Arts (demolished by an ordinance of 9 August 1820Wild 1989, p. 273.). The design of the auditorium was so well received, it was prescribed as the official model for the auditorium of a new opera house in the competition of 1861. The Salle Le Peletier was destroyed by fire in 1873, and the Nouvel Op√©ra (New Opera) opened in 1875. Debret also designed the Salle de la Bourse, which opened in 1827.Wild 1989, p. 68.Lance 1872, p. 184. Debret was elected a member of the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts in 1825 and became inspector general to the Conseil G√©n√©ral des B√¢timents Civils (General Council of Civil Buildings) in 1841. He was replaced by Rohault de Fleury as the architect of the Op√©ra in 1846 and shortly after the February Revolution of 1848 was dismissed as inspector general. Among his students and apprentices was Antoine-Nicolas Bailly.

Goda & B. Jalali, \\"Dispersive Fourier transformation for fast continuous single-shot measurements,\\" Nature Photonics 7, 102‚Äì112 (2013) doi:10.1038/nphoton.2012.359. temporal Fourier transform or photonic time-stretch (PTS) is a spectroscopy technique that uses optical dispersion instead of a grating or prism to separate the light wavelengths and analyze the optical spectrum in real-time. It employs group-velocity dispersion (GVD) to transform the spectrum of a broadband optical pulse into a time stretched temporal waveform. It is used to perform Fourier transformation on an optical signal on a single shot basis and at high frame rates for real- time analysis of fast dynamic processes. It replaces a diffraction grating and detector array with a dispersive fiber and single-pixel detector, enabling ultrafast real-time spectroscopy and imaging. Its nonuniform variant, warped- stretch transform, realized with nonlinear group delay, offers variable-rate spectral domain sampling,A. Mahjoubfar, C. Chen, & B. Jalali, \\"Design of Warped Stretch Transform,\\" Scientific Reports 5, 17148 (2015) doi:10.1038/srep17148. as well as the ability to engineer the time-bandwidth product of the signal's envelope to match that of the data acquisition systems acting as an information gearbox.B. Jalali & A. Mahjoubfar, \\"Tailoring Wideband Signals With a Photonic Hardware Accelerator,\\" Proceedings of the IEEE 103, 1071-1086 (2015) doi:10.1109/JPROC.2015.2418538. Operation principle TS-DFT is usually used in a two step process. In the first step, the spectrum of an optical broadband pulse is encoded by the information (e.g., temporal, spatial, or chemical information) to be captured. In the next step, the encoded spectrum is mapped by large group-velocity dispersion into a slowed temporal waveform. At this point the waveform has been sufficiently slowed so it can be digitized and processed in real-time. Without the time stretch, single shot waveforms will be too fast to be digitized by analog to digital converters. Implemented in the optical domain, this process performs a similar function as slow motion used to see fast events in videos. While video slow motion is a simple process of playing back an already recorded event, the TS-DFT performs slow motion at the speed of light and before the signal is captured. When needed, the waveform is simultaneously amplified in the dispersive fiber by the process of stimulated Raman scattering. This optical amplification overcomes the thermal noise which would otherwise limit the sensitivity in real-time detection. Subsequent optical pulses perform repetitive measurements at the frame rate of the pulsed laser. Consequently, single shot optical spectra, carrying information from fast dynamic processes, can be digitized and analyzed at high frame rates. The time-stretch dispersive Fourier transformer consists of a low-loss dispersive fiber that is also a Raman amplifier. To create Raman gain, pump lasers are coupled into the fiber by wavelength-division multiplexers, with wavelengths of pump lasers chosen to create a broadband and flat gain profile that covers the spectrum of the broadband optical pulse. Instead of Raman amplification, a discrete amplifier such as an erbium doped optical amplifier or a semiconductor optical amplifier can be placed before the dispersive fiber. However the distributed nature of Raman amplification provides superior signal to noise ratio. Dispersive Fourier Transform has proven to be an enabling technology for wideband A/D conversion (ultra wideband analog to digital converters)A. S. Bhushan, F. Coppinger, and B.

Relation to phase stretch transform  The phase stretch transform or pST is a computational approach to signal and image processing. One of its utilities is for feature detection and classification. Phase stretch transform is a spin-off from research on the time stretch dispersive Fourier transform. it transforms the image by emulating propagation through a diffractive medium with engineered 3D dispersive property (refractive index).

Its existence was first recorded in the late 13th century. In the Late Middle Ages and Early Modern Period it was frequently fought over due to its location between the territories of Brandenburg, Magdeburg and Brunswick.  Strategic location  In the areas of the Upper Aller and Ohre rivers, the former medieval principalities of L√ºneburg, Altmark, Brunswick, Magdeburg and Halberstadt bordered one another and, in some cases, were even geographically enmeshed. Several noble families made a name for themselves in the area including the Bartenslebens, Alvenslebens and von Schulenburgs. They played an important role as result of their position on either side of these borders. They owned large feudal estates which helped to give them considerable independence for long periods of time. Calv√∂rde formed a key strongpoint in this regard because it lay at the southern end of the formerly impassable marshy forests of the Dr√∂mling at a point that used to be the key crossing of the Ohre river that on the road from Brunswick to the southern Altmark.  History  Calv√∂rde originally belonged to the counts of Hillersleben, from whom it was inherited by the counts of Regenstein in the Harz mountains. For a long time Brandenburg, Magdeburg and Brunswick fought for the place against the Welf dukes. The little town, along with several nearby villages, belonged to the castle and formed a Brunswick exclave in what later became Prussian territory. Presumably through a marriage to the inheriting daughter of the von Wederde family, that died out before 1404 and had been the feudal tenants (Pfandherren) at Calv√∂rde, the barony went to the Alvenslebens of Rog√§tz Castle. Their two estates in Calv√∂rde and Rog√§tz complicated the ownership situation. The castellans (Burgherren) often acted as senior advisors (Geheime R√§te) to their landlords. In 1542 the Schulenburgs succeeded the Alvenslebens as feudal tenants. In 1571, the House of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel redeemed the barony again in order to manage it subsequently as an Amt. From 1608 to 1615, Duke Joachim Charles had his court at the castle, becoming a benefactor to the market town of Calv√∂rde. Although the castle had been expanded into a fortress in the 17th century, it fell into ruins not long thereafter.  Artist's impression  The former appearance of the castle has been preserved in two drawings. These are a Merian copperplate and an even older sketch that is now in the Fatherland Museum of Brunswick (Vaterl√§ndischen Museum Braunschweig) and has been supplements by plans in the Wolfenb√ºttel state archives. Calv√∂rde Castle around 1600 - drawing by Anco Wigboldus Present state The circular upper ward (Oberburg) is a group of buildings of various epochs. It was protected by several branches of the River Ohre and accessible over a drawbridge. The courtyard (Amtshof), watermill and the star-shaped gardens are representative of its appearance in the 17th century. The road to Gardelegen still runs in a semi-circle on the embankment of the Ohre. The lower part of the round bergfried in the centre of the inner courtyard is made of fieldstone, the upper storeys of red brick. It was thus called de rode Hinrik (\\"the red Henry\\"). The tower bears the Alvensleben coat of arms and contains the dungeon. Above it, on two storeys, are the armouries and the accommodation for the tower keeper. The southeastern side of the site is occupied by the three-storey reception hall (Palas) with its Gothic staircase tower. On it are the coat of arms of Brunswick and an inscription dated 1590, the year the castle was renovated by Duke Henry Julius. On the upper floor of the great hall are living quarters, above that the great hall (Rittersaal) and, in the adjacent wing, the chapel. The castellans (Burgmannen) were accommodated in the northern part of the site Between that and the gatehouse are the brewery, bakery and granary (Kornhaus). The crenellation and spire of the bergfried were destroyed in the Thirty Years' War. Other parts of the castle were demolished in 1737. In 1828 the castle was sold for demolition, so that the castle buildings have disappeared apart from an insignificant remnant.

Biography  Jean Renaudie joined the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des beaux-arts in 1945, studying in the studios of Auguste Perret then Marcel Lods. Gaining his architect's licence in 1958, he founded l'Atelier de Montrouge with Pierre Riboulet, G√©rard Thurnauer and Jean-Louis V√©ret (whom he met in 1956). He practiced a form of architecture that, due to its starkness and the simplicity of its plastic effects, is described as 'brutalist'. His studio stood out whether with the cr√®che in Montrouge or with the Vincennes stadium (contest, June 1963). He separated from the other members in 1968. As well as disagreement regarding the events of May 1968, they clashed on the planning of the new town Val-de-Reuil. Renaudie would have liked to put the town on the cliff overlooking the flat, wet site intended at the beginning. He thus created his own agency in Ivry-sur-Seine. From 1971 to 1975 and from 1976 to 1980, he participated in two phases of the renovation of the centre of Ivry, in collaboration with Ren√©e Gailhoustet. One of his projects, the Jeanne-Hachette shopping centre, gave him international recognition. From 1974, he worked on the renovation of the centre of old Givors, creating the City of Stars. Between 1976 and 1981, he participated in the urban development zone in Villetaneuse. He won the grand prix national de l'architecture from the French Minister of Culture for the sum of his works. The main focus of his work was on social housing and urban planning. He had been one of the first opponents of the construction methods of the major housing estates ('grands ensembles') and the first new towns in the 1950s and 1960s. He never wished to systematise architecture, creating a wide variety and diversity of apartments in his housing projects. One of his major achievements is found in Givors, at the foot of the ruined ch√¢teau. These blocks of social housing, on the side of a hill, have a very special architecture, which seeks to optimise the views and orientations of the houses.

Lislet was the son of Jean-Baptiste Geoffroy a white, French engineer working in Mauritius (then called Ile de France) and a freed black slave from Guinea. Lislet's father had freed his mother in order to take her as his mistress, but because Lislet was illegitimate, he took the name of the place of his birth for his last name.

Career At age 15, he entered the engineer corps and moved to Mauritius where he worked and studied astronomy and mathematics under Bernard Boudin de Tromelin, known as le Chevalier de Tromelin. When the Anglo- French War (1778-1783) began, Lislet-Geoffroy was made assistant pilot, serving with de Tromelin. In 1880, he became draughtsman to the engineers of the Isle de France, then the name of Mauritius. In 1788, he was appointed to map Mauritius, and his success in the project earned him commission as Geographical Engineer. Avoiding the reign of terror, he was commissioned in 1794 to visit and chart the Seychelles, and his success there earned him the promotion to assistant-officer in the body of military engineers. When Captain-General Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen took charge of Mauritius in 1803, Lislet Geoffroy was promoted to captain, and when Isle de France was captured, Lislet Geoffroy became chief of the commission for the inspection of the island. French Academy of Sciences In 1786, he was elected to the French Academy of Sciences. The academy was dissolved during the French Revolution, and Lilset Geoffroy was not among those reinstated when it reformed in 1793, possibly because of the distance between himself in the colonies and Paris, but possibly for prejudicial reasons.

He performed some of the first measurements of the propagation velocity of radio waves, helped develop France's first triode vacuum tube, and with Eugene Bloch invented the astable multivibrator. Life Henri Abraham was born July 12, 1868 in the 1st arrondissement of Paris. After brilliant studies at Chaptal secondary school, from 1886 to 1889 he pursued scientific graduate studies at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, where he attended the lectures of physics professors Jules Violle and Marcel Brillouin, and the Faculty of Paris, where he studied physics with Gabriel Lippmann and Edmond Bouty and obtained degrees in physical sciences and in mathematical sciences. He was then appointed for one year preparer physics laboratory of the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, then led by Jules Violle, where he wrote his thesis for the doctorate in physical sciences: \\"New determination of the ratio between electromagnetic and electrostatic units\\", which he received in 1892. He served as professor at Coll√®ge Chaptal (November 1890 ‚Äì September 1894), then at the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand (September 1894 ‚Äì November 1900). Lecturer at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure from 1897 (1899‚Äì1900 3rd year), he was appointed lecturer in physics in November 1900, then the conference's second year with Marcel Brillouin, then it supports the Conferences 1st year. He also succeeded Jules Violle as director of the physics laboratory of the school. He served as director of the laboratory at the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes from 1904 to 1905. After the annexation of the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure by the University of Paris, he was appointed on 1 November 1904 Lecturer of Physics at the Faculty of Paris, delegate to the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, then professor of physics in 1912. He served a term as exchange professor to Brazil in 1922. He retired in October 1937, when he received an honorary award. Eugene Bloch succeeded him as director of the physics laboratory, while Pierre Auger was his successor for physics conferences. He was Secretary General of the Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise de Physique from 1900 to 1912 and its President in 1922. With Gustave-Auguste Ferri√©, he founded the League of Radio√©lectriciens in 1921, and succeeded him as president in 1934. He was also president of the Society of clotting France in 1932, and in 1934 Secretary General of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics. Arrested by the militia on the night of June 23, 1943, in Aix-en-Provence, he was delivered to the Gestapo and taken to Marseille on December 7 at Drancy before being deported from the Bobigny station on \\"Convoy No. 63\\" 17 December 1943 to Auschwitz concentration camp, where he was probably killed on arrival, December 22, 1943. The Three Physicists Prize was named to honour him, Bloch and Georges Bruhat, who also died in Nazi concentration camps. Scientific work One of Abraham and Bloch's early astable multivibrators (small box, left) being used to calibrate a wavemeter (center) As a student at the ENS, Henri Abraham was fascinated by the pioneering experiments of Heinrich Hertz in 1888 on radio waves which confirmed the predictions of Maxwell's equations, established in 1864. His entire scientific career was devoted to developing applications of electromagnetic theory. In his thesis, he created a new measure of the relationship between units of electric charge used at that time in the electrostatic and the electromagnetic CGS systems of units. The ratio of these units was equal to the speed of wave propagation c, according to Maxwell. His work inferred a value of this speed with an uncertainty of 1/2000 that of experiments performed by the best physicists of the time. In 1899-1900, he measured very short time constants of the Kerr effect, a few billionths of a second, or about the time it takes light to travel one meter. Between 1911 and 1914, he made the first measurements of the actual speed of electromagnetic wave propagation, measuring the propagation times between remote stations (in collaboration with Alexandre Dufour and G. Ferrie). Mobilized in 1914 in the Department of Military Telegraphy, under the direction of Commander Ferrie, in collaboration with Eugene Bloch he developed the first French triode amplifying vacuum tube for radio reception. He and Bloch also invented the astable multivibrator. The harmonics produced by this device provided the first accurate technique for measuring radio frequencies, which was employed in 1916 in the French and English armies, and in the U.S. Army after 1917. After the war, Abraham helped his former pupil Alexandre Dufour achieve the first devices foreshadowing our modern CRT oscilloscopes, and to record the oscillations of high frequency radio waves. He also directed the thesis of Peter Fleury (1921). In the thesis of his pupil Jean Mercier (in 1923 ), a method is described which allows accurate measure of the frequency f of a radio wave and its wavelength L (distance traveled by the wave during the time period T = 1 / f). This measure allows deduction of the speed of light c = L / T = Lf with an unparalleled accuracy of 1:10,000. The same measurement method, applied with modern techniques after the Second World War in 1973, achieved a precision of nine significant digits, leading to a change in the definition of the meter.

Tasmania was a British colony from 1856 until 1901, at which time it joined five other colonies to form the Commonwealth of Australia. By the end of the colonisation in 1830 the British Empire had annexed large parts of mainland Australia, and all of Tasmania. First colonies 1803 The first British colonies on Tasmania appeared circa 1803. Small numbers of whalers and sealers set up communities along the Northern Coast and the Bass Strait islands. The whalers and sealers began to trade with the Aboriginal Tasmanians along the North Coast. Most of the goods traded were seal skins, dogs and Aboriginal women. Sporadic skirmishes over land and women occurred between the settlers and the Aboriginal people, but few records of the conflict exist. In late 1803 to early 1804 colonisation of Tasmania began to formalise. The governor of New South Wales built military outposts along the River Derwent in southern Tasmania, and also on the Tamar River in the north to prevent French interests in the area. These outposts began to grow into small communities as new settlers and convicts came from Great Britain. Communities around Hobart and Launceston were established, which would eventually become the largest settlements on Tasmania, and railways connecting the towns were built. The early colonies on Tasmania constantly suffered from lack of food. Agricultural expansion 1820 - 1830 By 1820, British authorities controlled around 15 percent of Tasmania, stretching from Hobart to Launceston. Much of this land had been settled for farming, with colonists exporting grain to Britain and rearing cattle for local consumption. It was during this agricultural expansion that the population of colonists grew from 7,185 in 1821 to 24,279 in 1830. During this time, the British authorities ceded rural land owned by the Crown to British colonists. About 6,000 settlers received land along rivers on the Eastern Midland Plain between Hobart and Launceston under this scheme, and many colonists also settled along the Meander River west of Launceston. These settlers reared sheep and exported wool and mutton to Northern England. The total number of sheep reared on Tasmania was around 1,000,000. Over time, the British acquired over 30 percent of Tasmanian land, and the entire area became known as the Settled Districts. By 1823 the population of Aboriginal people was estimated at around 2,000. Dogs were first introduced to Tasmania by British colonists, used to hunt game, such as kangaroos. Aboriginal people, convicts and settlers used the dogs as a way to source food and also used dog fur for clothing and shoes. They also used the kangaroo meat and fur that was hunted by the dogs as produce to sell. This hunting culture slowed down the agricultural development.Boyce, James. ‚ÄòCanine Revolution: The Social and Environmental Impact of the Introduction of the Dog to Tasmania‚Äô, Environmental History Vol. 11, No. 1 (Jan., 2006). Impact on the native population Authors such as Jeremy Paxman and Niall Ferguson have concluded that the British colonisation of Tasmania led to the genocide of the Aboriginal Tasmanians.Ferguson (2003) pp109-111 Although distantly related, the people on the island had been separate from the peoples of the mainland for around 8,000 years. It is unknown how many Aboriginal people were living there when the Dutch arrived in 1642, nor when James Cook landed in 1777, but when the British began their colonisation in 1803, there were an estimated 7,000-8,000, many of whom were already dying from diseases thought to have been contracted from European sailors, explorers and seal hunters. In addition, many had been left infertile by venereal disease. The introduction of technologically advanced, brutal convicts and less than sympathetic settlers must have contributed to their misery. Almost all of the 7,000 Indigenous Tasmanians were killed during a period of colonisation lasting around 27 years. By the end of Britain's colonisation in 1830, at least two families of Aboriginal people were living on the Island. By 1835 only one Aboriginal family remained on the island, who were living in a white sealing village near the Bass Strait, hiding from British authorities.Paxman (2011) pp.165-166 Recent figures for the number of people claiming Aboriginal Tasmanian descent vary according to the criteria used to determine this identity, ranging from 6,000 to over 23,000.

As a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist, Castro believed strongly in converting Cuba and the wider world from a capitalist system in which individuals own the means of production into a socialist system in which the means of production are owned by the workers. In the former, there is a class divide between the wealthy classes who control the means of production (i. e., the factories, farms, media, etc.) and the poorer working classes who labor on them, whilst in the latter, there is a decreasing class divide as the government redistributes the means of production leading to communism. Marxism is the socio-political theory developed by German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in the mid-19th century. It holds as its foundation the idea of class struggle, i. e., that society mainly changes and progresses as one socio-economic class takes power from another. Thus, Marxists believe that capitalism replaced feudalism in the early modern period as the wealthy industrial class, or bourgeoisie, took political and economic power from the traditional land-owning class - the aristocracy and monarchy. In the same process, Marxists predict that socialism will replace capitalism as the industrial working class, or proletariat, seize power from the bourgeoisie through revolutionary action. In this way, Marxism is believed by its supporters to provide a scientific explanation for why socialism should, and will, replace capitalism in human society. Leninism refers to the theories put forward by Russian revolutionary, political theorist, and politician Vladimir Lenin, the leader of the Bolshevik Party, who was a leading figure in the October Revolution that overthrew the Russian Provisional Government and replaced it with the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic under the rule of the Communist Party. Taking Marxism as its basis, Leninism revolves around putting forward ideas for how to convert a capitalist state into a socialist one. Castro used Leninist thought as a model upon which to convert the Cuban state and society into a socialist form.  Influences  Castro described two historical figures as being particular influences on his political viewpoints: the Cuban anti-imperialist revolutionary Jos√© Mart√≠ (1853‚Äì1895), and the German sociologist and theorist Karl Marx (1818‚Äì1883). Commenting on the influence of Mart√≠, he related that \\"above all\\", he adopted his sense of ethics because: :When he spoke that phrase I'll never be able to forget ‚Äì 'All the glory in the world fits into a grain of corn' ‚Äì it seemed extraordinarily beautiful to me, in the face of all the vanity and ambition that one saw everywhere, and against which we revolutionaries must be on constant guard. I seized upon that ethics. Ethics, as a mode of behavior, is essential, a fabulous treasure. On the other hand, the influence which Castro took from Marx was his \\"concept of what human society is\\", without which, Castro argued, \\"you can't formulate any argument that leads to a reasonable interpretation of historical events\\". Castro attended schools run by Jesuits that \\"contributed to my development and influenced my sense of justice\\". Castro also stated that it was at his Jesuit-run high school that he became influenced by Falangism, the Spanish variety of national syndicalism, and its founder, Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera. Castro also participated in Hispanidad, a movement that criticized Anglo Saxon material values and admired the moral values of Spanish and Spanish American culture.Fidel's Ethics of Violence by Dayan Jayatilleka, page 65  On the Soviet Union and its leaders  Although a Leninist, Castro remained critical of Marxist‚ÄìLeninist Joseph Stalin, who was the Premier of the Soviet Union from 1941 to 1953. In Castro's opinion, Stalin \\"committed serious errors ‚Äì everyone knows about his abuse of power, the repression, and his personal characteristics, the cult of personality\\", and also held him accountable for the invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany in 1941. At the same time, Castro also felt that Stalin \\"showed tremendous merit in industrializing the country\\" and \\"in moving the military industry to Siberia\\", things which he felt were \\"decisive factors\\" in the defeat of Nazism.  Politics and religion  Castro stated \\"Christ chose the fishermen because he was a communist\\".https://www.irishtimes.com/news/christ- was-a-communist-says-castro-1.292935 and in his 2009 spoken autobiography, Castro said that Christianity exhibited \\"a group of very humane precepts\\" which gave the world \\"ethical values\\" and a \\"sense of social justice\\", before relating that \\"If people call me Christian, not from the standpoint of religion but from the standpoint of social vision, I declare that I am a Christian.\\"Castro and Ramonet 2009. p. 156. Castro further believed that \\"faith is a personal matter that must be born in the conscience of every person. But atheism shouldn¬¥t be used as a rallying cry\\".http://evangelicalfocus.com/lifetech/2117/The_night_that_the_gospel_was_preached_to_Fidel_Castro In his book 'Fidel and Religion' Castro opines that there is a \\"great coincidence between Christianity‚Äôs objectives and the ones we Communists seek, between the Christian teachings of humility, austerity, selflessness and loving thy neighbour and what we might call the content of a revolutionary‚Äôs life and behaviour\\". Castro saw a similarity to his goals with the goals of Christ, \\"Christ multiplied the fish and the loaves to feed the people. That is precisely what we want to do with the Revolution and socialism.\\" adding that \\"I believe Karl Marx could have subscribed to the Sermon on the Mount‚Äù. However Castro is critical of the historical role of the Catholic Church which he describes as ‚Äúas a tool for domination, exploitation and oppression for centuries\\".https://www.ncronline.org/news/world/christ-marx-and-che-fidel- castro-offers-pope-his-religious-views  On Israel and antisemitism  In September 2010, The Atlantic began publishing a series of articles by Jeffrey Goldberg based on extensive and wide-ranging interviews by Goldberg and Julia E. Sweig with Castro, the first of which lasted five hours. Castro contacted Goldberg after he read one of Goldberg's articles on whether Israel would launch a preemptive air strike on Iran should it come close to acquiring nuclear weapons. While warning against the dangers of Western confrontation with Iran in which inadvertently, \\"a gradual escalation could become a nuclear war\\", Castro \\"unequivocally\\" defended Israel's right to exist and condemned anti-Semitism while criticizing some of the rhetoric on Israel by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the President of Iran, under whom Iran‚ÄìIsrael relations became increasingly hostile: Asked by Goldberg if he would tell Ahmadinejad the same things, Castro responded: \\"I am saying this so you can communicate it.\\" Castro \\"criticized Ahmadinejad for denying the Holocaust, and explained why the Iranian government would better serve the cause of peace by acknowledging the 'unique' history of anti-Semitism and trying to understand why Israelis fear for their existence\\".  Public image  By wearing military-style uniforms and leading mass demonstrations, Castro projected an image of a perpetual revolutionary. He was mostly seen in military attire, but his personal tailor, Merel Van 't Wout, convinced him to occasionally change to a business suit. Castro is often referred to as \\"Comandante\\" (\\"Commander\\"), but is also nicknamed \\"El Caballo\\" (\\"The Horse\\"), a label that was first attributed to Cuban entertainer Benny Mor√©, who, on hearing Castro passing in the Havana night with his entourage, shouted out: \\"Here comes the horse!\\".Richard Gott, Cuba : A new history. p. 175. Yale press. During the Cuban Revolution campaign, fellow rebels knew Castro as \\"The Giant\\".Jon Lee Anderson. Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life. p. 317. Large throngs of people gathered to cheer at Castro's fiery speeches, which typically lasted for hours. Many details of Castro's private life, particularly involving his family members, are scarce as the media is forbidden to mention them. Castro's image appears frequently in Cuban stores, classrooms, taxicabs and national television. Despite this, Castro had stated that he did not promote a cult of personality.\\"Fidel Castro\\" PBS Online Newshour February 12, 1985. Castro took a relatively socially conservative stance on many issues, opposing drug use, gambling, and prostitution, which he viewed as moral evils. Instead, he advocated hard work, family values, integrity, and self-discipline.

In 1627, it was published in the original Spanish in Brussels, and in the same year was published in Italian, at Rome. In Spain, the poem was first published in the Madrid edition of John's works of 1630.  Plot  In the Spiritual Canticle St. John of the Cross tries to explain the mystical process that follows the soul until it reaches its union with God. In order to get this, the poet uses an allegory: the search of the husband (Christ) by the wife (the human soul). The wife feels wounded by love, and this makes it to start the search of the Beloved (el Amado); the soul asks everywhere for him in despair until they finally get together in the solitude of the garden (Paradise). Versions Two redactions of the Spiritual Canticle exist. The earlier version of thirty-nine stanzas is generally referred to as Canticle A, and is derived from the Manuscript of Sanl√∫car. The later version, containing forty stanzas, is generally referred to as Canticle B, and is derived from the Manuscript of Ja√©n. One twentieth-century debate concerned whether the Canticle B was John‚Äôs own work, or that of another author.This debate was begun by Dom Philippe Chevalier, ‚ÄòLe Cantique spirituel de saint Jean de la Croix a-t-il √©t√© interpol√©?, Bulletin Hispanique, (Oct- Dec, 1922), pp307-342, whose position was supported by J Krynen and Roger Duvivier, among others. See San Juan de la Cruz, Doctor de la Iglesia: Obras completas, 14th ed. L. Ruano, ed., (Madrid: Bibioteca de Autores Cristianos, 1994), pp.592-3 However, more recent works on John have been willing to accept the authenticity of the Canticle B.See for example Cris√≥gono de Jes√∫s, Vida y Obras de San Juan de la Cruz, (Madrid: BAC, 1964), pp. 620-5. See Marie M Gaudreau, Mysticism and image in St John of the Cross, (1976), pp. 225-9 for a summary of the bibliography on this dispute.

Theme Garc√≠a described the play as interweaving serious critique of consumer society, despair over the human race through a deconstruction of Jesus of Nazareth. For Golgota Picnic, Rodrigo Garcia has collaborated for the first time with musician Marino Formenti, who performs in the show \\"The Seven Last Words of Our Saviour On the Cross\\" by Joseph Haydn on a piano, completely naked. The play has been shown in a number of countries, including Spain. Controversies The play has attracted criticism from conservative Christian groups. Its performance in 2011 in the French city of Toulouse, and subsequently in Paris, led to protests by French Catholics. Archbishop of Toulouse, Robert Le Gall, said that the play \\"fouled the faith of many believers\\", and bishop Dominique Rey of Frejus-Toulon criticized Garcia's depiction of Christ as \\"madman, dog, pyromaniac, messiah of Aids, devil-whore, no better than a terrorist\\". The head of the Th√©√¢tre du Rond- Point received death threats before the play's opening. Despite the protests, Christian activists' request to have the play banned in France were futile. Protests against the play have in turn aroused criticism from groups defending free speech. In 2011 Christian protestors in France faced counter- demonstrations by free speech groups. In 2014 protests Polish Catholics and nationalist activists protested against staging of this play in Poland.http://wyborcza.pl/1,75478,16231482,Protesty_na_pokazach__Golgoty_Picnic__w_calym_kraju_.html As in France, the play faced criticism from high-ranking members of the Catholic Church, such as archbishop Stanis≈Çaw GƒÖdecki. While the play was staged in theaters across Poland, theater goers faced hostile crowds attempting to bar them entry, singing religious ceremony, shouting criticism of the play, and on occasions, attempting to perform exorcisms. Several theaters have caved in and cancelled the play. The play was also withdrawn from the Malta Festival Pozna≈Ñ due to fears of riots. Garc√≠a described this as a religion-inspired censorship.http://poznan.gazeta.pl/poznan/1,36037,16191957,Rezyser__Golgota_Picnic___Zastraszyli_nas__To_cenzura_.html Dissenting artists held informal readings of the play, and a number of prominent artists led by film director Agnieszka Holland petitioned Polish government to intervene and prevent religious radicals from violating the freedom of expression, describing the protester actions as \\"an assault against Polish and European democracy and a symptom of backwardness\\". Meanwhile, politicians from the conservative Law and Justice party said that the play violates Polish blasphemy laws (Article 196 of the Polish Criminal Code which states that the \\"anyone who offends the religious feelings of other people [can be] subject to a fine, restriction of liberty or imprisonment for up to two years\\"), and filed a motion with prosecutions for investigation. Polish culture minister Ma≈Çgorzata Omilanowska supported the artists by saying \\"Freedom of artistic expression is the basis of democracy and the constitution.\\" A major newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza, published the script on 28 June.

Track & Field News ranked him the world's best javelin thrower in 1961. Career Born in Amiens, Macquet was originally a handball player, taking up the javelin in 1949. He won his first national championship title in the javelin in 1953, but his breakthrough years were 1955 and 1956, when he repeatedly improved the French record and entered the international javelin elite. In May 1956 Macquet threw 79.01 m, which was less than three meters short of Bud Held's world record; ahead of the 1956 Olympics he beat Finland's Soini Nikkinen, who had broken the world record in the meantime, in a dual meet between France and Finland. Macquet was considered a potential Olympic medalist, but at the Olympics in Melbourne he only threw 71.84 m and placed seventh. Macquet first broke 80 metres in 1957, and remained one of the world's top throwers for the next few years, improving his results slowly but steadily. However, he continued to disappoint in major championships; although Track & Field News ranked him in the world's top ten in every year from 1956 to 1961 and in the world's top two three times, he never won a medal at either the Olympics or the European Championships. At the 1958 European Championships in Stockholm he placed fourth with a throw of 75.18 m, only eight centimetres behind bronze medalist Gergely Kulcs√°r of Hungary. Macquet failed to qualify for the final at the 1960 Olympics in Rome, but was still ranked second in the world that year by Track & Field News. In 1961 Macquet set his personal best, 83.36 m, and was ranked first in the world. After 1961 Macquet was never ranked in the world's top 10 again, but still competed in his third Olympic Games in 1964, again failing to qualify for the final.

She served as president of the Conseil National des femmes fran√ßaises (CNFF/ literally, \\"National Council of French Women\\") between 1913 and 1922. Early life and family Julie Puaux was born on 13 February 13 1848 in Luneray, a small town couple of miles inland from Dieppe in Normandy, France. Luneray is one of the few places in this part of France to have a significant Protestant population. The Puaux family was Protestant, moderately prosperous and, at a time when the political and social reverberations of the revolution were still very much alive, anti-monarchist and passionately anti- catholic. Fran√ßois Puaux (1806-1895), Julie's father, was the minister at the (Protestant) Reformed Church in the town Julie's siblings included Frank Puaux (1844-1922), himself a Protestant minister-theologian and a noted historian of Protestantism in France. On 2 February 1869 Julie Puaux married Jules Siegfried (1837-1922) at Al√®s (Gard).L√©onore, acte de mariage. He was a successful businessman and politician originally from Alsace. The couple's son, Andr√© Siegfried (1875-1959), would later become known to English speakers for his commentaries on American, Canadian, and British politics. Career Siegfried was a feminist. Initially the focus of her energies was on education provision for girls in Le Havre, the major port city of which her husband served as the mayor (1870-1873 and 1878-1886). There was an apprenticeship college and, in 1880, a primary school. Then, in 1885, she was involved in setting up one of the first girls' secondary schools (lyc√©es de fille). Soon after her husband was elected to the Chambre des d√©put√©s (parliament) in 1885 the couple moved to Paris, setting up home initially in a centrally positioned apartment at 6 rond-point des Champs-Elyses and moving after ten years, to what became the family home at 226 boulevard Saint-Germain in the city's fashionable Left Bank district. Julie Siegfried now engaged actively in various feminist organisations and actions. She took part in the conferences at Versailles that were arranged by Sarah Monod and was involved with the journal, \\"La Femme\\". She worked with the Union fran√ßaise pour le suffrage des femmes(UFSF / \\"French Union for Women's Suffrage\\") and, most prominently, with the Conseil National des femmes fran√ßaises (CNFF/ literally, \\"National Council of French Women\\") of which she served as president between January 1913 and her death in 1922, in succession to Sarah Monod, the CNFF's first president. She became vice-president of the International Council of Women, of which the CNFF is the French branch. She also presided over the \\"League for Moral Education\\". But her most important role involved her CNFF work. The CNFF was the largest feminist organisation in France, with 21,000 members in 1900 and almost 100,000 in 1914. Its objectives included the provision of support, hygiene improvements, women's education and work for women. But its strongest advocacy concerned votes for women. In this campaign Julie Siegfried was strongly backed by her husband. Jules Siegfried and his parliamentary colleagues managed to have the necessary motion tabled and positively received in the National Assembly (lower house of parliament) in 1909, but there was no vote: at this stage, and for many more years even after the necessary legislation had been passed by the lower house in 1919, women's suffrage was blocked by the Senate (upper house).Anne-Sarah Bougl√©-Moalic, Le vote des Fran√ßaises : Cent ans de d√©bats 1848-1944, Presses universitaires de Rennes, 2012 Celebration In 1919 Julie Siegried was made a knight of the legion of honour in recognition, formally, of her work as president or founder of welfare support organisations and for war [welfare] work (\\"pr√©sidente ou fondatrice d‚Äô≈ìuvres d'assistance ou d‚Äô≈ìuvres de guerre\\").

History Armenians were recorded in Serbia in 1218 when Saint Sava invited constructors to build a Serbian Orthodox monastery after he had been to Armenia and seen the beautiful Armenian architecture there. The Armenians were to build Vitovnica Monastery, which has preserved a bilingual sacral text in Serbian and Armenian dating to the building. Armenians were a small part of the Ottoman Turkish army when they invaded Serbia prior to the Battle of Kosovo 1389. However upon hearing that they would attack a Christian people, they fled the Ottomans to the other side to fight alongside the Serbs. After the battle, the surviving Armenians settled in the hills of Sokobanja where they built Jermenƒçiƒá Monastery. Evliya Celebi registers an Armenian \\"district\\" of U≈æice in the 17th century. Remains of an Armenian graveyard lie in Kalemegdan fortress, which was last used in the 17th century after the Ottomans destroyed it. Only a few tombs are left in good condition. In 1810, the Turks destroyed the Celije Monastery, and the Serbs rebuilt it in 1811 with the help of wealthy Armenians. One of the benefactors had his idea of an Armenian style dome included in the work, so the monastery today can be considered an outcome of Byzantine/Serbian-Armenian architecture. In 1880s, merchants from the Gamakh region in Armenia settled in Valjevo (Tehlirians). Among the Tehlirians was Soghomon Tehlirian's father. During the Second World War, many Armenians moved to North America and France. In the past, there used to be an Armenian Catholic church in Novi Sad (built in 1746, razed in 1963). Some 500 female Serbian descendants of Armenians married Serbs in the 1990s.

He was a political figure of considerable importance in fifteenth century Ireland, and a supporter of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond. He was murdered as a result of a feud over the ownership of Baggotrath Castle, near Dublin.  Family  He was the son of William Cornwalsh: as the surname suggests, the Cornwalsh family had come to Ireland from Cornwall in the fourteenth century.Otway-Ruthven, A.J. History of Mediaeval Ireland Barnes and Noble 1993 p.115 He was probably descended from Sir John de Cornwall, Constable of Carlow Castle in the time of Edward III. He lived mainly at Dunboyne in County Meath. He married Matilda Rochfort and by her was the father of John Cornwalsh, himself a future Chief Baron.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.1 p.174  Career  He was a justice of the peace for Wexford and Waterford and Deputy Admiral of Ireland. He was appointed Chief Baron in 1420 on the advice of James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond. Irish politics was then dominated by the bitter and long-lasting feud between Ormond and the Talbot family, headed by John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, and Cornwalsh was a staunch adherent of Ormond. He quarreled with the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Sir Laurence Merbury, who accused Cornwalsh of gravely slandering him before the English Council.Otway-Ruthven p.359 Cornwalsh was suspended from office but restored in 1426, when the Irish Council sent him to London to give a favourable report on Ormond's tenure as Lord Lieutenant.Otway-Ruthven p.365 In 1420, when his predecessor as Chief Baron James Fitzwilliam died, Cornwalsh was appointed guardian to Fitzwilliam's young son, Phillip; with hindsight this may seem an ironic choice in light of his later murderous feud with Phillip's family.  Death  Baggotrath Castle was bought by Sir Edward Perrers in about 1403. Perrers was an English-born military commander and an influential statesman, who acted as Deputy to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and was a close associate of James Butler, 3rd Earl of Ormond. After his only son's death in 1428 possession of the castle passed to Sir Edward's widow Joanna. Under her will, made in 1440, she appointed Cornwalsh her executor: she died soon afterwards, and Cornwalsh entered into possession of the castle. His occupation of Baggotrath was deeply resented by Sir Edward's daughter Ismay and her husband William FitzWilliam, (a cousin of Cornwalsh's former ward Phillip FitzWilliam). The FitzWilliam family for centuries were the principal landowners in Dundrum, and constantly sought to expand their holdings. On 28 September 1441, when Cornwalsh had come up to Baggotrath to hold the Michaelmas assizes Fitzwilliam, according to the subsequent charges, assembled a large military force, seized the castle and murdered the Chief Baron.Ball, F. Elrington History of Dublin 6 Volumes Alexander Thom and Co. 1902-1920 Vol.2 pp.44-5 Baggotrath Castle  Aftermath  Given the gravity of the crime and the social prominence of the victim, it is surprising that Fitzwilliam and Ismay were soon pardoned for killing Cornwalsh, and were even allowed to retain possession of Baggotrath castle. Elrington Ball speculated that the Crown was not satisfied as to their guilt, or that Cornwalsh's actions were seen as sufficient provocation for the crime.Ball History of Dublin Vol. 2 pp.44-5 It was in any case relatively easy to get a royal pardon from Henry VI, even for crimes as notorious as the 1455 murder of the Devonshire lawyer Nicholas Radford by Thomas Courtenay, 6th Earl of Devon, which gravely shocked English public opinion.Ross, Charles Edward IV Eyre Methuen Ltd. 1974 p.390 Elrington Ball drew the inference that \\"violence is indigenous to the Irish soil\\".Judges in Ireland Vol.1 p.100 There is no doubt that murder and other violent crimes were all too common in fifteenth- century Ireland, even among the ruling class: Cornwalsh's son and heir John later married Matilda, widow of Thomas Hussey, 5th Baron Galtrim, who was reputedly murdered on his own wedding day, an episode which inspire the nineteenth-century ballad \\"The Bride of Malahide\\". On the other hand given the number of similar or even more heinous crimes in England, such as the Radford killing, it is perhaps fairer to conclude that there was a serious breakdown of law and order in both kingdoms, which greatly weakened the authority of the Crown.Ross p.390  References  1441 deaths Irish murder victims People from County Meath Cornish families 15th-century Irish people Year of birth unknown Chief Barons of the Irish Exchequer ","title":"James Cornwalsh"},{"id":"34270600","text":"Cham Mokhtar (, also Romanized as Cham MokhtƒÅr) is a village in Itivand-e Jonubi Rural District, Kakavand District, Delfan County, Lorestan Province, Iran.
