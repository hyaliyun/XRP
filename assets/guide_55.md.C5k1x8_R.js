The company also advocates that ‚ÄúSewage‚Äù which is a nuance for any town is actually a great resource when treated and can be used by industries to save fresh water for people and agriculture. The company is developing largest PPP project of 200 MLD capacity with reuse of treated water as the basic objective. The company was established in 1999. History In 1999, Mr. Arun Lakhani acquired Vishvaraj Housing Company Pvt Ltd. In the year 2000, the company's name was changed to Vishvaraj Infrastructure Ltd. VIL is a firm in the infrastructure space working in the highways, water and wastewater sectoring. It is a company that is focused on developing Water and Highway projects. Vishvaraj Infrastructure Ltd. (VIL) specializes in three broad, high potential sectors ‚Äì * Water * Waste Water and * Transportation Business Divisions Transportation India boasts of 3.3 million km of highways, with 80,000 km of National highways and 131,000 km of State highways. Vishvaraj spotted opportunity in roads sector way back in 2000 and decided to stay focused on BOT projects. It made a humble start with the development of 8.3 km Bypass road on BOT basis, which was one of the first BOT concessions awarded at that time. Vishvaraj has 6 projects in its Highway Business Portfolio covering 1,116 Lane kilometers and estimated Project costs of Rs.21,955 million. Its projects are across Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. Water Vishvaraj Environment Pvt Ltd has been pioneering innovative PPP models in infrastructure. The company's objective is to contribute in removing man-made water crisis and to provide water security to the nation. The company has implemented 24x7 water distribution project for the city of Nagpur which is a first of its kind of project in India. Many other cities are replicating the model. The company also advocates that ‚ÄúSewage‚Äù which is a nuance for any town is actually a great resource when treated and can be used by industries to save fresh water for people and agriculture.

It would provide an emergency evacuation route for school children to escape a future lahar flow from Mount Rainier, consisting of an up to high flood of mud, rock and boulders. , the $40 million bridge was still in the planning phase. Background Historic mudflows from Mount Rainier Steel highway bridge embedded in lahar from 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Lahars from the Cascade Volcanoes are historically common. Orting is situated in the floodplain of the Puyallup River and on top of the debris field of past lahars from Mount Rainier, including the Osceola Mudflow. The Osceola Mudflow followed an eruption 5,600 years ago that left a horseshoe-shaped crater in Mount Rainier comparable to that of the 1980 eruption of Mount Saint Helens and deposited debris across a area as far as Commencement Bay on Puget Sound. Another event, the Electron Mudflow, produced a lahar that was deep when it reached the Puget Sound lowland. The current lahar risk is considered extremely high in Orting, with an estimated one in seven chance of a catastrophic event in a resident's lifetime. Land use planning and emergency management in Orting differs from that in surrounding Pierce County, allowing development and location of schools in this area. The Mount Rainier Volcano Lahar Warning System has existed since 2000 to give residents in high-risk areas some advance warning of an approaching lahar, but evacuation drills in Orting have shown that motorized transportation (school buses) is not a viable option for removing students from the lahar zone due to road congestion and time factors. Evacuation planning at Orting schools started in 1995, and it was then that the insufficiency of infrastructure began to be an issue. , drills were showing student evacuation times via an existing foot route to still be in excess of the notification window. Bridge design A yearlong design process was started by Pierce County in consultation with Washington State Department of Transportation and other agencies and a citizens' group in January, 2009, after considering other evacuation means such as pathways and a tunnel under the river. The bridge would be wide and accommodate 12,000 people in 30 minutes. Orting is estimated to have a 40 minute evacuation window after the Mount Rainier Volcano Lahar Warning System is activated. Preliminary design renderings from 2014 show a pedestrian suspension bridge with stairsteps approaching a lower pier, and another pier higher on a ridge above Orting, near the community of Tehaleh. Part of the bridge deck would contain stairs and lie at a 40% slope.

Built in 1850, it is a well-preserved example of a mid-19th century schoolhouse with Greek Revival styling. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Description and history The Brock Hill Schoolhouse stands in a rural area of western Newbury, on the west side of North Road. It is a modest single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled cedar shingle roof, clapboard siding, and a modern concrete foundation which replaced an original fieldstone foundation. The main facade is unadorned except for a central entrance and a flagpole, mounted above the entrance. The sides and rear each have two window bays. The interior has a small coatroom, which is separated from the class room by a reproduction of an original divider wall. The interior walls are all finished in beadboard with a chair rail, painted in latex paint. A 19th-century wood stove stands in the center of the classroom. with The school was built sometime between 1802 and 1818, and served Newbury's District 8. Its name derives from its presence near the farm of Thomas Brock at the time of its initial construction; the land for the school was given by E.S. Brock when the school was rebuilt into its present shape in 1850. The school served the rural upland area's students until 1913. The school was apparently abandoned for a time, and was sold by the school district in 1960, seeing uses that may have included a hunting lodge. At one time it was fitted with plumbing and electricity, but these changes have been reversed. Adjacent to the schoolhouse is a surviving 19th-century privy and woodshed structure; both were the subject of restoration in the early 2000s.

In addition, the system shows very strong optical, ultraviolet, and radio pulsations originating from the red dwarf with a period of just 1.97 minutes, which is a beat period from the orbital rotation and the white dwarf spin. These pulsations occur when a relativistic beam from the white dwarf sweeps across the red dwarf, which then reprocesses the beam into the observed electromagnetic energy. At present, the white dwarf is not accreting significantly, and the system is powered by the spin-down of the white dwarf. The pulsar is about the same size as Earth.

Like Antonio Francisco Lisboa, also known as Aleijadinho, he is one of the most famous artists of colonial Brazil and was of mixed race. Mestre Valentim recounts details of his life in his testament. He was born in Serro do Frio to Manoel da Fonseca e Silva, a white man, and Amatilde da Fonseca, a black woman. Although he never married, his relationship with Josefa Maria da Concei√ß√£o resulted in a daughter named Joana. Although the details of his artistic training are up to debate, he may have traveled to Portugal with his family as a child. By adulthood, he found himself living and working in Rio de Janeiro.  Career  Alligator fountain, Passeio Publico, Rio de Janeiro He began his career as a sculptor, and numerous sculptural works within Rio de Janeiro's churches have been attributed to him. He was also instrumental in creating a foundry and in producing the first large-scale bronze cast sculptures made in Brazil. Exceptional for an artist of color in colonial Brazil, Mestre Valentim became an architect. He received numerous commissions from the viceroy Dom Luiz de Vasconcelos e Souza. Also unusual for a colonial Brazilian artist is the fact that a portrait painted during his lifetime still exists today. Jo√£o Francisco Muzzi's painting includes Mestre Valentim presenting architectural plans to the viceroy. none One of his most ambitious projects was the design of the Passeio P√∫blico of Rio de Janeiro, the first public park in Brazil. The sculptural works of the park include stylized entrance gates; two obelisks; statutes of Greek gods and Brazilian plants and animals; and several fountains. The park featured two pavilions containing paintings by Leandro Joaquim (1738‚Äì1798). Unfortunately, most of Mestre Valentim's design has since been altered, many of the sculptures removed, and the pavilions eliminated.

He was involved in various iterations of Japanese professional baseball from 1929 through 1959. Born in Taiwan under Japanese rule, Yokozawa graduated from Meiji University. He umpired for Japan's nascent professional league in the years 1929-1935; he also helped the Tokyo-based team to four victories in Japan's Intercity Baseball Tournament. At the beginning of the Japanese Baseball League (JBL), Yokozawa managed the Tokyo Senators in 1936‚Äì1937. Yokozawa played second base for the team in one game in 1937, and had one plate appearance. Leaving managing, Yokozawa became an umpire in the JBL in 1938, working in that capacity through the 1944 season. Meanwhile, his old team the Senators (after a number of ownership and name changes, disbanded following the 1943 season). In 1946, Yokozawa looked to revive the franchise and soon founded the new Senators. He assembled a team of ready and able players, but as a newly formed team the Senators faced strict fiscal management and resorted to using hand-me-down uniforms from the Hankyu Railway's pre-war team, the Hankyu Club (who would eventually become the modern-day Orix Buffaloes). Former Japanese statesman Kinkazu Saionji, grandson of the influential Kinmochi Saionji, became the team's owner, and Noboru Oride, borrowing heavily from a Ginza cabaret proprietor, became the team's sponsor. Trapped by a lack of funds, Yokozawa was forced to resign as the team's manager after one season. Returning again to umpiring, Yokozawa remained in that position until 1959. When the JBL reorganized into Nippon Professional Baseball in 1950, Yokozawa was named umpire-in-chief of the Pacific League division.

In a 2014 article, The Telegraph claims that al-Bakr \\"has connections\\" to Abd al-Malik Muhammad Yusuf Uthman abd al-Salam who was added to the U.N. Security Council‚Äôs Al-Qaida Sanctions List in 2015. Al-Salam, widely known as Umar al-Qatari, is a Qatar-based Jordanian national designated as a SDGT for giving \\"thousands of dollars and material support to a Syria- based al-Qaida associate intended for ANF (Al-Nusra Front) operatives\\", recruiting for ANF, facilitating travel to ANF in Syria, and working alongside Ibrahim al-Bakr to acquire and transport weapons to Syria with the help of a Syria-based al-Qaeda operative. Lebanese paper al-Mustaqbal reported that Abd al-Malik mediated a $50,000 delivery from Ibrahim al-Bakr to Muhsin al-Fadhli, an al-Qaeda operative. According to the same source, al-Malik initially acknowledged his role in the exchange, although he eventually denied that he had facilitated the delivery.https://www.rewardsforjustice.net/english/muhsin_al_fadhli.html As Foundation for Defense of Democracies Senior Fellow David Weinberg recorded in his report titled ‚ÄúQatar and Terror Finance. Part II: Private Funders of al- Qaeda in Syria‚Äù, Bakr also provided currency for al-Nusra fighters and their families to Abd al-Malik as he was travelling to Lebanon from Syria. Specifically, al-Malik reportedly admitted that he had received ‚Äúroughly 15,000 euros, 5,000 Qatari riyals, and Syrian, American, and Malaysian currency‚Äù, a version that he later retracted. In late 2012, Ibrahim al-Bakr traveled to Waziristan, Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Pakistan \\"for his work with al-Qaida.\\" Because Umar al-Qatari also traveled to Waziristan in 2012, where he spent time at an al-Qaida training camp, some questions remain about whether their connection extended beyond their work for al Nusra Front and into supporting al-Qaeda training sites. In March 2013, Lebanese newspaper al-Joumhouriya claimed that in 2012 Bakr had met in Beirut with both Abd al- Malik and Shadi al-Mawlawi, which Lebanese authorities prosecuted and convicted as a terror financier on behalf of al-Nusra. On that occasion, al- Bakr allegedly provided Mawlawi with funds to purchase weapons for Nusra fighters in Syria. Furthermore, al-Bakr reportedly encouraged Mawlawi to facilitate deliveries of ammunitions and funds into Syria.http://www.aljoumhouria.com/news/index/61579 As of late 2014, it was reported that the U.S. believes al-Bakr is \\"still providing financial, material, or technological support to al-Qaeda.\\" In spite of his long track record as a terror financier, it appears that Qatar has never properly prosecuted Al-Bakr or pressed charged against him. Currently, no record exists that charges were pressed in absentia. Terrorist designation On September 24, 2014, the U.S. Department of the Treasury named Ibrahim ‚ÄòIsa Hajji Muhammad al-Bakr as a SDGT and a foreign terrorist fighter facilitator. On January 23, 2015, the United Nations Security Council‚Äôs ISIL & Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee listed al-Bakr as being associated with al-Qaeda for \\"participating in the financing, planning, facilitating, preparing, or perpetrating of acts or activities by, in conjugation with, under the name of, on behalf of, or in support of\\" and \\"otherwise supporting acts or activities of\\" al-Qaeda.

Al-Attiyah was reported by Lebanese and American authorities of being a financier for al- Qaeda and its Syrian affiliate, the al-Nusra Front. In May 2012, Lebanese officials were tipped off by the United States that al-Attaiyah was using their country as a base to funnel money to the al-Nusrah Front. According to Lebanese media, he gave $20,000 to Umar al-Qatari also known as the ‚ÄòWolf of al-Qaeda‚Äô and Shadi al-Mawlawi, both al-Qaeda operatives and U.S. designated terrorists. He was consequently arrested in Lebanon, but due to intensive lobbying efforts by Qatari authorities, he was released on May 23, shortly after his arrest.http://www.alhayat.com/OpinionsDetails/402371 Some of these efforts included Qatar reportedly threatening to deport over 30,000 Lebanese expats residing in Qatar if their demands of al-Attiyah's release were not met. Although he was charged and sentenced in his trial in absentia in June 2014 to seven years in prison by the Lebanese military for ‚Äúbelonging to an armed terrorist organization and conspiring against state institutions with the purpose of altering the structure of the Lebanese state,‚Äù and for ‚Äúfinancing terrorist groups and the introduction of weapons to Syria delivered through rebels‚Äù, he currently resides in Qatar where continues to show support for dangerous terrorist groups. Al-Attiyah also worked on the Mahdid Ahl al- Sham Campaign online fundraising campaign in August 2013, where he co- presented a fundraising video that asked for donors for support to arm Jihadists in Syria. This defunct campaign, posed as a charity organization, has been known to fund violent extremists. It was shut down in 2014, and has been described by the U.S. Department of State as suspicious of sending support to extremist elements in Syria. Additionally, it has been identified as a source of financing for the Al-Nusra Front, the Syrian branch of Al- Qaeda, listed by the United States as a terrorist group. Additionally, he continues to display his support for terrorists and terror activities on his Twitter page, frequently voicing admiration for Osama bin Laden, al-Nusrah Front, and ISIS. In a tweet posted on November 9, 2014, he stated his wish for Bin Laden to still be alive, and hopes that he is resting in paradise. His ties to the royal family have caused controversy for Qatar and their inadvertent support for terrorists and the financing of terrorists. Al-Attiyah is first cousins with Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah, Qatar's head of ‚Äúadministrative control and transparency agency‚Äù, responsible for enforcement against money laundering and terrorist funding. Despite the blatant ties and Qatar's disregard of his cousin to terrorist financing, Qatar's foreign minister insisted that Qatar does not condone radical terrorists or terrorist groups. The al-Attiyah family stems from the same lineage as Qatar's ruling family, the al-Thani's and the Banu Tamim‚Äôs, who are considered the second most prominent tribal clan in Qatar.

The album was composed by Bijibal, features four songs and was distributed by Muzik 247, which released on 1 January 2016. The album received positive feedback from music listeners. Production About the development and concept of \\"Idukki\\", Pothan said that the song helped him introduce the audience to the story's locale: \\"It was the plot of the movie that came to my mind first. Then I decided to fix the milieu in Idukki. Not all viewers may have been to Idukki\\". According to the director, \\"A person from an urban setting may not go on to take revenge like what the central character does in Maheshinte Prathikaram. Hence, I had to convey the lifestyle of [the] Idukki people to the audience\\". Lyricist Rafeeq Ahammed said that he had never visited Idukki or felt deeply about the district. He asked friends in Idukki: \\"They told me that they wanted a song that captures the beauty of the place. It is one of the beautiful places in Kerala embellished with forests and rivers\\". The music was composed after the lyrics were written; Ahammed wrote the song as a poem in one day. According to Bijibal, it was easy to compose \\"Idukki\\" because it had such \\"motivating lyrics\\". He originally recorded the song with a small orchestra, singing it himself. The composer later recorded another version with a lush orchestra; however, Pothan thought it lacked the beauty of the original and used the first version in the film. In addition to her role as Jimsy, Aparna Balamurali sang \\"Mounangal\\" with Vijay Yesudas. At her audition, she also sang. Aparna was recommended by Pushkaran's wife, who is her university instructor. According to the actress, \\"I was made to sing while at the set quite frequently. Later, it must have struck them that it is a good idea to give me a song\\". Music video The video of the first song, \\"Idukki\\" (featuring Fahadh Faasil) was released on 1 February 2016. It was sung by Bijibal and written by Rafeeq Ahamed. The song, which begins with the line \\"Malamele Thirivech\\", describes the beauty of Kerala's Western Ghats. The song video of \\"Theliveyil\\" sung by Sudeep Kumar and Sangeetha Sreekanth, which released on 4 February 2016; was set at a funeral ceremony as its backdrop and begins with a brief vocal by children. The video songs of other tracks \\"Mounangal\\" and \\"Cherupunjiri\\" was released on 5 and 7 February. Reception Malayala Manorama placed \\"Mounangal\\" at number one on their Tunes Weekly for 12 February 2016. According to reviewer Nelson K. Paul, \\"Composer Bijibal perfects this one with the finer layersof clarinet, of saxophone, of violins, of guitars, of sitar, to name it alladded in. These elements blend in the right proportions to produce a rather affecting song. Vijay Yesudas and Aparna Balamurali make no mistake behind the microphone. The loop before the charanam is musically rich with the enchanting association of the instruments mentioned above. Class act by the composer, once again\\". Although Paul called \\"Idukki\\" the film's best song, he also found \\"Mounangal\\" charming. He praised Bijibal for his work on \\"Idukki\\": \\"His brilliance, as a composer and singer, is in display in the 'Idukki' song. The composer-singer gives Rafeeq's simple, smile-evoking lyrics the right treatment, keeping to minimal instruments while executing a soulful rendition. He is ably backed by the wonderful female chorus. Even without the visuals, one would long to feel the beauty of Idukki\\". Elizabeth Thomas of The Hindu described the song: \\"We feel like standing right in the middle of the hilly terrain. As the song goes on describing Idukki, its people, and their lifestyle, we sway and swoon along, feel the mist and greenery and as the song ends, we become one with the place and its people\\".

Being headquartered in Kiev, Ukraine, the League still provides a solid ground for a direct cooperation between all of its members, which are students of the leading Ukrainian, Polish, Dutch as well as British universities. Those students are young lawyers, political scientists, international affairs experts, sociologists, economists etc. During 2015-2016, the organization's activities spread to Kyiv, Lviv, Dnipro, Odessa, and others. In addition, the organization is represented in Poland (Warsaw, Krak√≥w), the Netherlands (Groningen), Sweden (Lund), Germany (Berlin), the United Kingdom (London), Portugal (Lisbon), France (Paris), India (New Delhi). At the beginning of 2016 the organization has applied to the International Federation of Liberal Youth. In June 2017, the organization gained full membership in the International Federation of Liberal Youth. In October of that year, the organization became an associate member of the European Liberal Youth, which is the youth wing the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party. In September 2017, a memorandum of cooperation between the organization and the largest Lithuanian liberal organization, the Lithuanian Liberal Youth, was signed.  Purpose and Objectives  The main purposes of the Liberal Democratic League of Ukraine are the preservation and distribution of fundamental human rights and freedoms, including their social, economic and cultural aspirations and interests. For these ends the organization aims:¬´–î–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∏ –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω—ñ–∑–∞—Ü—ñ—ó¬ª ¬´ * to develop and equally distribute liberal democratic ideas; * to unite Ukrainian youth with liberal outlook, who strive to see Ukraine as a strong and progressive liberal democratic state; * to take effective collective measures to protect the fundamental human rights and freedoms; * to foster the liberalization of the Ukrainian law; * to improve Ukrainian legislation by preparing projects of regulations, providing scientific and legal opinions, examination in all branches of the law, conducting political and social research; * to achieve fruitful cooperation with the new generation of patriotically minded Ukrainians; * to develop international cooperation with liberal, democratic and liberal democratic organizations and associations from different countries. * to popularize Ukrainian history, culture and traditions both regionally and internationally; * to practice public control over the processes of adoption of laws as well as challenging the accountability of the Ukrainian government. Its members also look forward to establishing a liberal democratic political party based on the values and objectives of the Liberal Democratic League of Ukraine in the nearest future.  Ideology and concepts  According to the Charter of the Liberal Democratic League of Ukraine, the Manifesto of the organization involves the following principles: * The liberty of one citizen ends where the liberty of another citizen begins; * Personal responsibility for own deeds and actions is the basis for the successful and progressive society; * Individuals agreed to surrender some of their freedoms and submit them to the authorities in exchange for protection of their remaining rights. Thus a state serves as an instrument for the successful realization of the aspirations and goals of its citizens; * Market economy and private property have proved to be the best means to earn capital and build wealth, therefore a laissez-faire practice is sine qua non in domestic affairs. * The right to life, liberty and security of people along with the personal happiness of each are the main values, which must be promoted and protected. * Apart from the aforementioned ideas, the very framework of the organization is based on the principle that Ukrainian people can live in prosperity provided that the political power is exercised by young yet matured Ukrainians, which were born in an independent Ukraine. Furthermore, an international activity of the organization is carried out in accordance with the principle that \\"Ukraine is not only Europe, but also the whole world\\".  Structure  In order to embody these objectives, the organization has a unique internal structure, which corresponds with all main trends of the LDLU. The organization is composed of different Departments, which in turn are subdivided into Sectors. As of August 2016, the key Departments of the Liberal Democratic League of Ukraine are as follows: * Liberal Democracy Department * Human Rights Department * Education and Youth Department * Domestic affairs Department * Foreign affairs Department * Law Department * Sociology, Analyses and Prognoses Department * PR-Department * HR-Department  The Viche  The Liberal Democratic League of Ukraine Viche is the principal organ of the organization that comprises all members. Every member has one vote and nobody has the right of veto. It is the Viche, which is in charge of making all core decisions.  The Council  There is also a Council of the LDLU, which is another decisive organ responsible for making decisions in between the sessions of the LDLU Viche. As of the year 2018 the Council consists of:‚Äû–ü—Ä–æ –Ω–∞—Å‚Äú * Arthur Kharytonov ‚Äì the President of the Organization; * Yevheniia Shulha ‚Äì the Vice President of the Organization; * Roman Leuta ‚Äì the Head of the Secretariat of the Organization; * Olena Ohorodnik ‚Äì the Head of the Liberal Democracy Department; * Denys Hatseniuk ‚Äì the Head of the Human Rights Department; * Vira Hembarska ‚Äì the Head of the Foreign affairs Department; * Serhii Poroshenko ‚Äì the Head of the Domestic affairs Department; * Karyna Stepanova ‚Äì the Head of the Education and Youth Department; * Taras Paslavskyi ‚Äì the Head of the PR-Department; * Mykhailo Rudenko ‚Äì the Head of the HR-Department; * Olha Tsurkan ‚Äì the Advisor to the President;  Activity of the organization   Public liberal enlightenment  The project was introduced to conduct classes and lections dedicated to liberalism, which are believed to spread liberal seeds among students. The program of lections is made up of topics dedicated to protection of the fundamental human rights and freedoms, strengthening the rule of law, pluralism, coherent society and liberal democracy. The project was introduced in the Ukrainian Humanities Lyceum, Kiev, in winter 2015. Both the school‚Äôs administration and students warmly welcomed the idea of program. The LDLU is about to run the same projects in other schools of the Ukrainian capital. In 2017, the list of schools where the project was held enriched by Gymnasium ‚Ññ 59 named after Alexander Boychenko, Lyceum \\"Naukova zmina\\", secondary school ‚Ññ 78 (Kiev), etc.  Lessons in Dissent in Ukraine  The Liberal Democratic League of Ukraine was among very few Ukrainian organizations, which supported the Umbrella Revolution in Hong Kong in 2014. Being inspired by the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong, the representatives of the LDLU have contacted Matthew Torn, a producer and expert in Hong Kong politics. He showed his interest and even supported the idea of a project aiming to show his Lessons in Dissent movie in Ukraine. Matthew Torn also gave an exclusive interview, in which he expressed his respect to and admiration of young Ukrainians, which do their best in fighting kleptocracy. Notably, the actions of governments of both the European Union and the United States were said to be very weak in solving the Ukrainian crisis, hence were even criticized by Matthew Torn. Meanwhile, in his conversation with Arthur Kharytonov, who is the President of the Liberal Democratic League of Ukraine, the leader of the Umbrella Revolution Joshua Wong for the first time commented the political situation in Ukraine by supporting the Ukrainian struggle against both internal and external enemies. The premiere of Lessons in Dissent in Ukraine took place on 25 April 2016 in Kiev, and next day in Lviv.  Inclusive friendly  Disabled people in Ukraine face a number of problems in all main spheres of social life, as the Ukrainian authorities do nothing in order to improve the standards of life for people with disabilities, which eventually have to spend their free time at home.

Early life  Ram Prasad Nautiyal was born to Shri. Gauri Datta Nautiyal and Smt. Devaki Devi on 1 August 1905 at Kanda village of Beiroankhal block in Pauri Garhwal Uttrakhand (part of the then United province of Agra & Awadh). He was one of the prominent freedom fighters from Uttrakhand and most importantly probably the only major name who worked in Himalayan ranges itself, returning from the cities like Delhi, Kolkata, Lahore etc., where it was a bit easier to sustain and campaign in comparison to dangerously scattered hill areas. He had two siblings, named Bali Ram and Kashi Ram. Ram Prasad Nautiyal was the eldest of the three. It is said that while studying in Karachi (now in Pakistan), Bali Ram Nautiyal took part in anti-British activities and was jailed for that. In jail, he was brutally tortured by police, he could never recover from this and died at a young age. Though Ram Prasad belonged to an average Pahari family, any how they managed him to study in DAV School in Dehradun, where during a speech by Sarojini Naidu some students started chanting pro-freedom slogans; Ram Prasad was one of them. For this they were fined Rs.50 each and in case of non- compliance three weeks of imprisonment was dictated, as Ram Prasad did not have any money to pay, he had to remain in jail for three weeks. Later on he was rusticated; since he did not stop his sloganeering even after being incarcerated.  A short stint with British Army  After being rusticated he left for meerut where he joined the British Army as a record keeper and was sent to Balochistan in supply division. There he saved Colonel Abbott from an attack by a Balochi Sardar named Torkhan. Colonel Abbott helped in learning horse riding which made him eligible to move to 63 mobile core in Rawalpindi (Now in Pakistan). One day while two British army battalions (2/8 Punjab regiment led by colonel Davis and 5 Royal Maratha regiment headed by colonel Valley) were engaged in a proxy war some fugitives from Royal Russian army attacked them, and several British soldiers got killed. Ram Prasad Nautiyal along with his two companions were given a responsibility to inform colonel Davis who got stuck on the other side of the dried river belt where exercise was going on. Ram Prasad Nautiyal successfully completed the task while the other two caught into the Russian firing and died on the way. This impressed Colonel Davis, who promoted as adjutant quarter master. This experience with British army proved handy for him in future.  Lala Lajpat Rai's death and impact on Ram Prasad Nautiyal  While serving in British Army he got to read an article in Arya Gadget (published from Lahore) on Lala Lajpat Rai's death. At that time Bheemsen Sachhar was the editor of the paper. There was a line written in the article which said, \\"I am born in an enslaved country, where any ordinary police officer can kill me beating with canes.\\" Death of Lala Ji in the hands of an ordinary British officer and these mind boggling articles in the newspapers shook his conscience and he decided to leave British Army. After being released from army he met Dr. Kichloo and Dr. Gopinath who were leading this freedom struggle in Lahore (now in Pakistan), they advised the young man to go to Kolkata and participate in Congress cession there. Ram Prasad reached to Kolkata before the scheduled date of the conference; there he met Dr. S. S. Hardikar, who admitted him to Congress service committee. Meanwhile, an agitation was in progress at Grand Peninsula railways, Ram Prasad and his companions were caught distributing pamphlets supporting the agitation. All of them were arrested and taken to Fort-William fort from there they were sent to jail, in jail he came across Shripad Amrit Dange, Kedarnath Sehgal, Barrister Joglekar, Achyuta Patvardhan and many other leaders. In the meantime a compromise between Congress and British government was done and all the political prisoners were let off a week before the scheduled date of the annual conference of Indian National Congress in Kolkata. After the conference was over Dr. Hardikar selected four Satyagrahis for UP, Ram Prasad Nautiyal was one of them. They were sent to Hugli for six months for training. After his training was over he was sent to Lahore. In those days Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, Battukeshwar Datta, Sukhdeve and Jagdish used to visit Lahore frequently, as their visits were planned secretly so nobody could meet them. In 1930 when annual congress cession was scheduled to be held in Lahore at the bank of river Ravi, Ram Prasad was one of the members of service committee (though he had to flee before the cession could start in 1929, itself). In this cession a proposal for complete freedom was taken up (on 26 January 1930). There was a student leader named Pushpa (niece of principle Chhabildas and daughter of an inspector in British CID) from D.A.V. College, she was the head of women service committee, Ram Prasad was completely indulged in his anti-government activities, and an arrest warrant was already circulated to capture him, this information was sent to him secretly by the women leader. As soon as Ram Prasad got the news, he left Lahore at midnight in a disguise and started his journey on foot, via Pathankot he reached Dalhousie and then Chamba district of today's Himachal. Later on he moved to a Mathh in Sahpur, there he met Sukhdev and Jagdish Chandra Jain who were absconding from Lahore conspiracy. After meeting them he shifted to a nearby Arya Samaj Temple and was arrested from there. He was sent to Lahore jail where many young freedom fighters were incarcerated and were being tortured to confess their involvement in the murder of British officer Saunders. British police started torturing Ram Prasad to confess his crime and tried to make him one of the accused in the case, when they failed to do so they tried to convince him to become an informer, but everything proved futile and British police had to release him on 21 December 1929 from Lahore jail.  Civil Disobedience in Garhwal and Kumanyun  After being released, he directly reached to the campus of annual Congress cession at the bank of Ravi. Where he was given a duty to look after the visitor camp for the delegates from UP. Here he got a chance to meet people from Garhwal and Kumayun, prominently Har Govind Pant, Kumayun Keshri Badri Dutta Pandey, Victor Mohan Joshi, Devi Singh Kauriya, Anusuya Prasad Bahuguna, Kripa Ram Mishra Manhar and may others. Later he was appointed as an inspector to Satyagraha guides of Kumanyun and was sent to Ranikhet. He ran several camps in Garhwal and Kumayun region. He opened his office in Dogadda (nearby Kotdwar) and continued his activities. By this time he got famous as \\"Kaptaan (captain) Shahab\\" amongst fellow revolutionaries. Civil disobedience was on its peak and entire country was following Gandhi ji, Ram Prasad Nautiyal decided to propagate this message to the public and make them aware about their rights. In several public meetings held by him and his group they persuaded public to protest against increased taxes that was dictated by British authorities. Consequently, 76 revenue and Thokedars resigned from their posts and started supporting revolutionaries in their fight against British government. Meanwhile, forest department started wire fencing around Pilan river which resulted in closing of the grazing land for the cattle breaded by the public living in the villages scattered around those lower part of Himalayan ranges. Ram Prasad Nautiyal rallied against it and uprooted the wire fencing. While an arrest warrant was circulating for him he kept his activities being underground, though police succeeded in arresting him from Bhatwadon village in Rikhnikhal block of Pauri district. He was arrested under section 208 of Indian penal court and was sent to two years of rigorous imprisonment.  I am not a British Citizen  While returning from a Prabhat-Pheri from ChunaDhar (a little ahead of Dogadda) all the Satyagrahis were chanting pro-freedom slogans, suddenly came deputy commissioner of the police Ibbotson with his team. Ganga Singh Tyagi a class 9th student was holding tri-color in his hand and shouted, \\"Bharat Mata ki Jai\\", \\"Vande Matram\\". This made Ibbotson very angry, he started flogging the child. Ganga Singh fell unconscious, even at this Ibbotson came off his horse and started booting the child. On seeing this Ram Prasad got infuriated, he got DCP by his collar and flung him down the road. Luckily Ibbotson got hold of an uprooted tree and saved his life. Police tried to catch Ram Prasad but he fled away to Chunadhar hills. Later on when he was arrested, he was brought to Justice MS Gill in chains, who asked to immediately remove his chains and hand calves. Ibbotson's lawyer started reading the charge sheet; Judge asked Ram Prasad, \\"Do you want to say something?\\" He said \\"When Ibbotson is available in the court not as a DCP but as a petitioner than why he does not come to witness box and narrate the incident.\\" The judge looked at Mr. Ibbotson and he had to come to witness box, and narrated entire incident truthfully. Now judge looked at Ram Prasad and said, \\"what do you want say in your defense?\\" Ram Prasad replied, \\"I don't consider myself to be a British citizen and saying anything in British court would be a dishonor for me. Thus he refused to be a part of any legal procedure with British authorities saying that they have no right to rule his country and their rule is unlawful.  A bid to siege British establishment in Lansdowne  In 1942 Gandhi started the Quit India movement and gave a slogan of \\"do or die\\". In this spree of protests, rallies and violent struggle many revolutionaries captured several strategically important places and offices throughout the country. Ram Prasad Nautiyal and his fellow rebellions had some meetings in the juggles of Pauri Garhwal region, they concluded that it was best time to take control back from British establishment in the area. They divided entire Garhwal and Chamoli region in four zones and created four teams for the respective zones. A central committee of twenty one people was also conceived to handle the entire operation; As Ram Prasad Nautiyal was a military trained person he held the main responsibility in the committee. In the final meeting of central committee the plan was given finishing touches, and a draft was issued for all the four zones established earlier. The plan said, they would first snap all the telephone lines connecting Lansdowne to remaining country, then Lansdowne court will be seized and S.D.M. Mr. Ambadatta would be declared to be the D.M., finally they would take control of the treasury and thus hand over entire administration to the public. For interim governance an executive committee will be stablished under fellow Pratap Singh Negi. Unfortunately, in this important meeting Mr. Mangatram Khantwal was also present; who while on his way back home leaked the entire plan to a British agent named Govind Singh Maalgujaar, the later one straightly went to D.C. Ferneeds in Lansdowne and informed him about possible coup. Mr. Ferneeds ordered to seal all the routes leading to Lansdowne, army was deployed on Chaumasun bridge and Bandhar bridge, licensee arm holders were summoned and entire administration was handed over to security personnel who now had a free run. Now they knew that it would be very difficult to face armed forced deployed in huge numbers throughout the region, however they kept working on their plan. Taking a lead Ram Prasad Nautiyal reached to Karnaprayag with his supporters, brock into the PWD store there and picked seven cartons of dynamite, by walking hundreds of kilometer the explosives were brought to Beironkhal block, from there it was distributed to all four zones established earlier. On 27 August 1942, revolutionaries got all the schools and government offices closed in the area, thousands of people started marching towards Lansdowne. Ram Prasad Nautiyal himself headed through Toonikhal with 80 odd people, and then he sent a team of 50 people to Dhura area to snap telephone lines connecting Lansdowne. While cutting the telephone wires one of their associate got caught into electric wiring and a heavy shock of the electric current flung him down the hill. Meanwhile, authorities and army started witch-hunting, hundreds of people were incarcerated. On getting the news of causality in the process of snapping telephone lines Ram Prasad Nautiyal and his associates started a search for the dead-body of their companion, Ram Prasad himself lifted the body on his shoulder brought it to a nearby river bank and quietly performed the rituals with changing of Vande Mataram in the night itself. Thousands of people were marching towards Lansdowne for the planned coup; might be in a day or two it could have resulted in unavoidable clashes between British security personnel and common public but sensing the fact that this bloodshed might not result in any good, Ram Prasad decided to stop marching teams wherever they were. Risking his life he kept running pillar to post and met the people who have already marched ahead in different places, convinced them to go back for time being, and accommodated thousands of people who could not returned immediately. The plan got failed but it irked British government too much, they started arresting who so ever they wanted, tortured people, illegal detentions were common. The situation deteriorated to such a low that when British agents did not find any male member in a house they used to sexually assault female members of the families. To avenge this, people killed a British officer and threw his dead-body into a river in Kumartha village; Police charge-sheeted a named Kantichand Uniyal for this who fled to the jungles of Badrinath, where he died of cold and hunger. Later on when Ram Prasad Nautiyal was arrested he was informed that due to his activities government had to call army and in total it took Rs.84 Crore (today it could translate into millions of dollars) to suppress the revolt.  Death of his toddler son and ailing father  While Ram Prasad Nautiyal was indulged in anti-British activities from the jungles of Kolaggad keeping himself underground, he was informed that his father was ill and might die any time, after confirming the news he came to his village, hungry from days he ate leftover food. He saw his father lying unconscious having a bed sheet over his face; he touched his father's feet, asked his mother for blessings and to allow him to leave. But family and relatives told him that his father might not live even by morning, so being eldest it was his duty to perform the rituals (at least to burn the pyre). Ram Prasad agreed to stay by 4:00 AM in the morning, while he woke up at 2:00 AM at night, a team of 200 police personnel sieged the house. It was decided that he must not be touched till morning on the condition of his surrender to the officials; however his family denied his presence at home. Nayab Tesildar Chandan Singh came up the stairs and shouted \\"Kaptaan Sahib, you are under arrest!\\" Tehsildar's arrogant shouting made Ram Prasad angry; he broke down the door of the room where his mother locked him to avoid his direct confrontation with heavily armed police force. He came out to the gallery grabbed Chandan Singh by his neck and threw him down the floor. While Chandan Singh fell down he opened fire at Ram Prasad, who retaliated with his pistol. On hearing gun fire his toddler son (who was already ill) fled to the nearby Manduaa fields. Entire family was traumatized on seeing such a heavy police force and the kid fell unconscious. In the morning Ram Prasad Nautiyal asked police team to arrange for Dhol-Damau and Ransingha for his departure and told that he was not an ordinary thief but a revolutionary. On seeing his aggressiveness and to avoid bloodshed police had to accede to his demands. Thus he was carried in a palanquin with Bands and trumpets to Dunav and further on a war horse.  After Independence  Dr. Hardayal Pant appointed him as an organizer of regional security groups. There were 36 posts functioning under him. They had 460 rifles, 8 machine guns and 50,000 cartridges. Later on he was appointed as a guide to a panel who surveyed McMahon line along with China border, on 19 November 1949 they returned from the border. Later on he was sent to Niti Mana, where he trained 600-odd local citizens on assault rifles as area-defense groups. Then he was moved to police training center in Moradabad. In 1951 he met Govind Ballabh Pant and expressed his desire to work for the public in Garhwal and Kumayun region. The same year assembly election were to be held and he demanded a ticket for the same but Mr. Pant denied on the pretext of his being required in more valuable work by the government. But Ram Prasad Nautiyal took an appointment with central leadership of Congress and met Nehru ji and Patel ji. Thus he successfully fought Uttar Pradesh assembly election from Lansdowne twice in a row.  As an MLA from Lansdowne constituency  In first ever assembly elections in independent India in 1951 he defeated Shri Padma Datt by 5647 votes from Lansdowne East constituency. (http://www.elections.in/uttar- pradesh/assembly-constituencies/1951-election-results.html) In 1957 he got 12824 votes and won the Lansdowne East seat once again. (http://www.elections.in/uttar-pradesh/assembly-constituencies/1957-election- results.html) In his two terms as a member of Legislative Assembly from Lansdowne East constituency he worked on spreading a network of motor roads in the region and by opening cooperative societies he prioritized economic empowerment of public. ;Ram Nagar - Marchula - Beironkhal - Thalisain motor road and Deriyakhal - RikhniKhal - Beironkhal motor road Ram Nagar - Marchula - Beironkhal - Thalisain motor road and Deriyakhal - RikhniKhal - Beironkhal motor road are his measure achievements, both the motor road links were completed by the help of local public, later on when Ram Nagar-Beironkhal road was completed there were no buses to ply through the route. He campaigned for Cooperative societies and collected fund to buy two second-hand buses. Most of the parts of these roads are now given an status of National Highways. ;Users Transport society Ltd and Daalagaon drinking water scheme In 1957 he started working on Users Transport society Ltd; and got it stablished in 1958. In his leadership Users Transport Society had 24 buses plying on different routes in Garhwal and Kumayun region. Daalagaon drinking water scheme was another measure work, this scheme provided potable water to dozens of village scattered in the vicinity. For the financial inclusion and empowerment of the public he established cooperative banks in Lansdowne, Beironkhal, Naugaonkhal etc. He himself bought shares of these banks and encouraged the public to do so.  Death  He never felt easy with modern Congress leaders and went into self-imposed exile from politics. As he was a man of public, he could never accept this state of seclusion and fell ill. He lived in Kotdwar Garhwal for most of this period. After a short illness he died on 24 December 1980.

Plot In 1943, World War I veteran Jim Butler (Montagu Love), along with his daughter Nona (Inez Cooper) and their English servant and friend, Harry Adams (Ernie Adams), live on Sunday Island, a small island in the South Pacific. Their idyllic life is shattered when an air battle takes place over the island. One pilot bails out of his damaged aircraft while the other pilot manages to land. A German pilot, Lt. Kurt Heiman (Henry Guttman) finds that the American pilot Allan Scott (Edward Norris) is unconscious, but before he is killed, Mona entreats Helman to bring the wounded American to her home. Butler is afraid that either pilot will contact their superiors about the valuable oil deposits on the island, so he takes control of the situation, confiscating the German's pistol and insisting that both antagonists agree to a truce. Helman has a secret ally on the island, Captain Van Bronck (Robert Armstrong) and together, the two make plans to have Japanese invaders to take over the island. An uneasy alliance of Butler and the American pilot is needed to beat back the attack, but ultimately, the islanders and their friends are able to summon help from the Americans.

At that time he was a member of the Pauline Hanson's One Nation party, but on 18 December 2016 he resigned from the party to sit as an independent. On 23 December 2016 the Federal Court of Australia held that Culleton was bankrupt. On 11 January 2017 the President of the Senate, Stephen Parry, wrote to the Governor of Western Australia, Kerry Sanderson, advising her that as a result of Culleton's bankruptcy his seat in the Senate was vacant. Culleton disputed the effect of the court's order and claimed still to be a Senator. His appeal against the bankruptcy order, to the Full Court of the Federal Court, was dismissed on 3 February 2017. On the same day, the High Court determined that Culleton had, in any case, been ineligible for election to the Senate due to a criminal matter in New South Wales. The Senate vacancy left by Culleton was later filled by his brother-in-law Peter Georgiou, One Nation's second Senate candidate for WA in the 2016 election, after an official recount. Culleton established The Great Australian Party in April 2019. On his 2019 nominee declaration, he provided his profession as \\"Senator in Exile\\". Time in the Senate Culleton was declared as elected as a Senator for Western Australia on 2 July 2016 as the lead candidate on the Pauline Hanson's One Nation ticket during the 2016 election. At the time he had been convicted in absentia on a larceny charge over a vehicle key in New South Wales, but had not yet been sentenced. On 18 December 2016 Culleton announced on Twitter that he had resigned from One Nation, citing a lack of party support and \\"un-Australian behaviour\\". Party leader Pauline Hanson responded that Culleton had been \\"a pain in my backside\\" and that she was \\"glad to see the back of him\\". Debt and legal proceedings Culleton was involved in a long and complex history of legal proceedings in relation to claims he owed money to a number of different companies. * Macquarie Leasing Pty Ltd obtained a judgment in the WA District Court against Culleton in March 2013 for $94,304. In 2014 Culleton was bankrupted over this debt,. however in 2015 the bankruptcy was set aside by consent.. * In May 2013 Permanent Custodians, part of the ANZ Bank group, foreclosed on the Culletons' farm which was near Williams, Western Australia, obtaining judgment against the Culletons for $4,672,859 plus interest.. The Culletons unsuccessfully attempted to have this set aside, in 2014, and 2016.. Culleton referred to his dispute with the ANZ Bank in his submissions to a Parliamentary Joint Committee, and in his first speech to the Senate. *Elite Grains, a company associated with Culleton had been placed in liquidation and the report to creditors said that Elite Grains had $5.4 million in secured debt, $656,000 in unsecured liabilities and that \\"There will not be a dividend to any class of creditor in this liquidation\\". *Balwyn Nominees, a company associated with former Wesfarmers director Dick Lester, obtained judgement against the Culletons for $205,536 plus interest in 2013.Dakin Farms Pty Ltd v Elite Grains Pty Ltd (No 2) [2013 WADC 160]. The Culletons have unsuccessfully attempted to overturn this judgment in WA Courts in 2015, 2016, and 2017.. In 2016 Culleton commenced proceedings in the Federal Court seeking to overturn the judgment however this application was dismissed as being erroneous and \\"entirely unarguable\\".. Creditors petition and bankruptcy A Senator who becomes bankrupt is thereby disqualified from membership of the Senate and the seat becomes vacant.Constitution of Australia, sections 44(iii) and 45. Balwyn Nominees sought an order in the Federal Court that Culleton be made bankrupt. On 23 December 2016, after a tumultuous hearing, the Federal Court rejected Culleton's application for trial by jury, found that the technical requirements of the Bankruptcy Act had been met and held Culleton's various other submissions were unarguable and totally without merit. The court ordered sequestration of Culleton's assets, with the effect of declaring him bankrupt.. The court granted a 21-day stay on proceedings under the sequestration order, with Culleton announcing that he would appeal the decision. Culleton's appeal was dismissed by a full court of the Federal Court on 3 February 2017 (see below). After receiving an official copy of the trial judgment from the Federal Court as well as documentation from the Inspector- General in Bankruptcy, on 11 January the President of the Senate, Stephen Parry, wrote to the Governor of Western Australia, Kerry Sanderson, to notify her that Culleton's seat had become vacant due to his having become an undischarged bankrupt on 23 December 2016. Parry added that, since the matter of initial ineligibility was still before the High Court sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, he was currently unable to advise that the ordinary procedure for filling a casual vacancy (section 15 of the Constitution) Casual vacancies. applied and he would provide further advice following the Court's decision, expected \\"in the near future\\". Culleton immediately announced that he would lodge a High Court challenge to the President's ruling as \\"premature\\" since the 21-day stay was to run until 13 January. On 12 January the Federal Court extended the stay of proceedings under the sequestration orders by one week. Culleton maintained that this was also a stay of the declaration of bankruptcy, so that he continued to be a Senator. However, he was already listed on the Parliament website as a \\"former Senator\\". On 19 January it was reported that Culleton's lawyer had received a letter from Parry's office which warned that, in continuing to identify himself as a Senator, Culleton could be committing the serious offence of impersonating a public official, and that in response Culleton had amended his parliamentary Facebook page to read \\"Rod Culleton ‚Äì 'Senator' for WA ‚Äì Gone Fishin'\\" and changed the signature on his parliamentary emails to \\"Rod Culleton  Federal Senator for Western Australia (Gone Fishin')\\". On 31 January 2017, Justice Gageler in the High Court rejected challenges by Culleton to the Court's jurisdiction and to Parry's decision.. On 3 February 2017, a full court of the Federal Court unanimously dismissed Culleton's appeal against the sequestration order. It rejected Culleton's claim that the trial judge had treated him unfairly, finding that the judge had dealt properly with his \\"unfocused and erratic\\" submissions. It also rejected his argument that a sequestration order does not necessarily involve a finding of bankruptcy, confirming that \\"insolvency, not judgment execution or debt collection, is the essence of an application for a sequestration order\\". at [16] and [52]. Culleton unsuccessfully sought a stay of the sequestration order in the High Court.. Criminal charges In April 2014 Culleton was involved in a dispute with a tow truck driver in Guyra, NSW. The tow truck driver was attempting to repossess a truck and the key to the tow truck was lost. Culleton was charged with larceny in relation to the missing key. When the matter came before the local court in March 2016 Culleton was not present, saying he did not have time to travel to the Court as he was required to be in court in WA the day before on unrelated larceny charges (see below). Culleton was convicted in his absence. He successfully applied to set aside the conviction, with the conviction being annulled on 8 August 2016. Culleton then pleaded guilty to the offence, and was ordered to pay the truck driver's costs but a conviction was not recorded. A second, unrelated, larceny charge, concerning a hire car in Western Australia in March 2015, has not yet been heard in a court. The allegations are that receivers had attended the property of Mr Dixon near Cuballing, Western Australia, with the ANZ Bank alleging he had defaulted on a loan. While the receivers were inside the farm house talking to Mr Dixon, the hire car was blocked in by hay bales. The car was subsequently moved and it is alleged that Culleton tried to obtain a key. While the charge was expected to be heard in August 2016, it was listed to be heard in the Perth Magistrates Court over a four-day period, in September 2017. When the case was heard, Culleton represented himself, shouted at the magistrate and threw his eyeglasses in her direction (they hit a table); a police officer removed him from the court, but he apologised to the court and was allowed to return to cross-examine witnesses. However, since the case was set to run for only one more day and there were a large number of witnesses, the hearing was adjourned until 2018. Senate ineligibility Under section 44(ii) of the Constitution, any person who \\"has been convicted and is under sentence, or subject to be sentenced, for any offence punishable under the law of the Commonwealth or of a State by imprisonment for one year or longer\\" shall (section 44 continues) \\"be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives\\". Disqualification. Previous time in prison was not a disqualification and there have been numerous politicians who had spent time in prison before their election. The High Court had previously observed that the disqualification is not simply for the conviction for an offence, nor serving time in prison. The disqualification required both conviction and that the person was imprisoned at the time or awaiting sentence.. The WA larceny charge did not give rise to any question of disqualification as Culleton had only been charged and had not been convicted. At the time of Culleton's nomination and election, he had been convicted for the New South Wales offence but had not been sentenced. A former colleague lodged a petition with the High Court (sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns), claiming that Culleton was not able to nominate for the election as he was convicted and awaiting sentence in New South Wales at the time of the election. Subsequently, the Australian Government asked the Senate to also refer the matter to the High Court; the reference included a request to determine what should be done if Culleton's seat were found to be vacant. The primary issues before the High Court concerned the effect of the subsequent annulment of Culleton's conviction and whether Culleton was subject to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for one year or longer. On 3 February 2017, the High Court determined the Senate reference, unanimously finding that Culleton had been ineligible for election to the Senate. At the time of the 2016 election he was subject to being sentenced to imprisonment for up to two years, which under Constitution section 44(ii) rendered him ineligible for election. This had not been affected by the subsequent annulment of the finding of guilt; the annulment had operated only from the time of the annulment. The vacancy should be filled by a special count of the ballot papers. Any directions necessary to give effect to the conduct of the special count should be made by a single Justice. However, the Court anticipated that a simple recount, as if Culleton had not been a candidate, would make the votes cast for him (so far as they were \\"above the line\\", which was 96% of them) would flow through to the next One Nation candidate. The Court ordered, as the Commonwealth had previously agreed, that most (with specific exceptions) of Culleton's costs of the action would be borne by the Commonwealth (Culleton had initially represented himself, but eventually he had been provided with counsel).; full name \\"In the matter of questions referred to the Court of Disputed Returns pursuant to section 376 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth) concerning Senator Rodney Norman Culleton\\". The majority stated, in an introductory summary of their judgment (with which Nettle J differed only as to reasoning): at [4] per Kiefel, Bell, Gageler & Keane JJ. > Senator Culleton was a person who had been convicted and was subject to be > sentenced for an offence punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer > at the date of the 2016 election. That was so, both as a matter of fact and > as a matter of law. The subsequent annulment of the conviction had no effect > on that state of affairs. It follows from s 44(ii) that Senator Culleton was > \\"incapable of being chosen\\" as a Senator. In the result, there is a vacancy > in the representation of Western Australia in the Senate for the place for > which Senator Culleton was returned. The beneficiary of the recount, as determined by the High Court on 10 March 2017, was Culleton's brother-in-law, Peter Georgiou. When the Senate resumed on 7 February, the President of the Senate, Stephen Parry, informed the house of the High Court's decision that Culleton had been ineligible to nominate and that consequently his election was void and he was not a Senator. Parry stated that this did not invalidate any Senate proceedings in which Culleton had taken part, by reference to the High Court decision in Vardon v O'Loghlin; that salary paid to Culleton as a Senator had been paid without authority and accordingly was now a debt due to the Commonwealth; and that whether any of that debt should be waived was a decision for the government, on which Parry had sought advice from the finance minister. In May 2017, Culleton was informed by the Commonwealth Department of Finance that \\"payments made to you and in relation to you since the election on 2 July 2016 are a debt to the commonwealth\\" and might include superannuation payments, other entitlements and staff payments. Culleton was invited to consider his options, which could include providing evidence of his financial circumstances. Culleton told media that he would not be answering the Department's letter. \\"I‚Äôm just going to hang in like a flea in between the shoulder blades of a dog\\", he said, \\"right where it can‚Äôt scratch.\\" Special Minister of State Scott Ryan confirmed that this department, as well as the Senate, had so written to Culleton and also to disqualified Family First Senator Bob Day; he indicated that they could apply for the debts to be waived. Culleton commented that he intended to appeal the High Court judgment against him to the Privy Council: on being reminded that this has been virtually impossible since the Australia Act 1986, he said that he disagreed.The only conceivable such avenue appears to be through Constitution s 74, by invoking the royal prerogative. However, s 74 permits the Commonwealth parliament to limit appeals to the Privy Council and an appeal against this High Court decision appears to be excluded by the Privy Council (Limitation of Appeals) Act 1968 (Cth), s 3, or at any rate by the Privy Council (Appeals from the High Court) Act 1975 (Cth). It was observed in the High Court in 1999 that, considering Australia Act s 11 as well as those earlier acts, \\"no institutions of government of the United Kingdom exercise any judicial powers with respect to this country\\": . See also On 8 August 2017 the President of the Senate reported that he had received correspondence from Culleton's lawyers \\"requesting the Senate to refer matters relating to Mr Culleton back to the High Court for reconsideration\\" and added, \\"I am advised that the Senate has no power to comply with this request.\\"Senate Hansard (proof) 8 August 2017, p 2., tabling both the and the The Great Australian Party In 2018, Culleton initiated the process to establish a new political party, The Great Australian Party, to stand candidates for the Senate in the 2019 Australian federal election. He continued to refer to himself as a \\"senator-in-exile\\" and sought to appeal his disqualification to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. Other policies of the proposed party were to remove personal income tax, nationalise the Commonwealth Bank and abolish the Family Court of Australia. The party was formally registered by the Australian Electoral Commission on 7 April 2019. Culleton became the party's lead candidate for the Senate in Western Australia in the May 2019 election. His nomination was immediately referred to the Australian Federal Police to clarify the possibility that he had made a false declaration on his nomination form. Personal life Culleton's wife Ioanna (n√©e Georgiou) is of Greek heritage, and her family came to Australia in the 1970s, when she was five years old. While a member of the One Nation Party, Culleton did not support the party position that multiculturalism had failed. He became an advocate for farmers after his own farm at Williams was foreclosed in 2013. Culleton is linked to at least three companies, including Elite Grains, that were under liquidation in 2016.

It is known from Malesia and Polynesia. Description The rhizomes are dorsiventral (having distinct upper and lower surfaces) with stipes closely spaced attached in two rows. The stipes are jointed and have phyllopodia at the base. The rhizome scales have hairy edges, and are of uniform color and usually glossy. The leaf blades are undivided, usually bearing branched veins and more than one row of sori on either side of the costa. They always have unbranched hairs, while many species have branched hairs with a single gland at the apex. Some species have hydathodes, some of which are cretaceous (leaving a lime deposit on the leaf around them). The sporangia bear one to two (occasionally as many as six) stiff, simple straight hairs without glands at the tip of the sporangium. Parris observed that the genus resembles Prosaptia in bearing phyllopodia at the stipe bases, but lacks the clathrate rhizome scales of that genus. The presence of simple, stiff hairs on the sporangium is shared with Oreogrammitis and Radiogrammitis. Taxonomy The genus was first described by Barbara Parris in 2013 to receive some of the species of the genus Grammitis, which as then circumscribed was artificial and contained a number of disparate lineages. The name \\"Archigrammitis\\" means \\"chief Grammitis\\", referring to the size of the fronds, A. friderici-et-pauli being the largest member of Grammitis under the former circumscription. Species Parris placed six species in the genus, which were accepted by the Checklist of Ferns and Lycophytes of the World, : *Archigrammitis demissa (Parris) Parris *Archigrammitis friderici-et-pauli (Chris) Parris *Archigrammitis marquesensis (Parris) Parris *Archigrammitis ponapensis (Copel.)

Russian soldier of World War II (called, in the Soviet Union, the Great Patriotic War) and a Hero of the Soviet Union. Biography Zhilin was born on to a peasant family in the village of Upper Beloz—ërki in Stavropol Region of Samara province. He lost his father, brothers, and sisters in the Russian famine of 1921‚Äì22. Only he and his mother Martha V. survived and they lived in abject poverty and the family is remembered as the poorest in the village. Zhilin had only a primary education. At age 16, Zhilin began working in the collective farm \\"Kalinin\\". He became assistant secretary of the local Komsomol (Communist youth league). In 1933, the Komsolol sponsored Vasily to work on the construction of the rubber-asbestos mill in Yaroslavl. In 1937, he was drafted into the Red Army. After graduating from the regimental school, he became a junior officer. He participated in the occupation of eastern Poland in 1939 and the Winter War against Finland in 1939‚Äì1940. At the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, Zhilin was in the army reserve. In the early days of the war he was evacuated to Omsk where he worked in the tire plant. He was recalled to active service in December 1941. On 2 February 1942 he was sent to the front, where he served in a heavy mortar battery in the 872nd Infantry Regiment of the 282nd Infantry Division in the northern sector of the front. He participated in battles at Velikiye Luki and Nevel and was wounded on 3 September 1943. In 1944, Zhilin was a sergeant in a guards rifle company of the 199th Guards Regiment of the 67th Guards Rifle Division, part of the 6th Guards Army of the 1st Baltic Front. On the night of 25 June 1944, Zhilin and his company crossed the barrier of the Western Dvina. In his report on this action, the commander of the regiment Lieutenant Colonel Degtyarev wrote: For this heroic action, Zhilin was awarded the decoration of Hero of the Soviet Union. After treatment for his wounds he returned to his post in the guards, where he was twice wounded in further fighting, on 11 August 1944 and 11 November 1944. After the war, Zhilin was discharged and returned to Stavrapol-on-Don (now Tolyatti), where his mother had moved after remarriage. According to his official biography, he worked in the city's Department of Physical Education and served on the Executive Committee for Sports and took an active part in the social and political life of the city. However, according to the recollections of colleagues, he did not actually work much, for health reasons; his colleagues, in deference to his status as a war hero and in consideration of his poor health, and because he was well-liked, did not require much work of him. He was a member of the District Committee of the Komsomol. Zhilin died on 24 July 1947 in Stavropol-on-Don, from tuberculosis. He was buried with full military honors. When Stavropol-on-Don was moved to its current location of Tolyatti (because of the filling of the Kuybyshev Reservoir), his grave was moved to Banykinskom Cemetery.

Garippo (June 4, 1931 ‚Äì May 31, 2016) was a former Cook County judge and supervisor in the state‚Äôs attorney‚Äôs office best known as the presiding judge over the trial of John Wayne Gacy. He also made notable contributions during the trial of Richard Speck and the controversy which surrounded Chief Illiniwek.  Early life and education  Garippo was born and raised in the Galewood neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois on June 4, 1931. His father (Louis P. Garippo) was a committeeman of the 36th ward of Chicago and played a role in his future decision to make a living as a judge. Garippo received his Bachelor's degree from the University of Notre Dame in 1952 after his completion of Fenwick High School four years prior. At Notre Dame in addition to his studies Louis was secretary of the bowling team for the year of 1950. From there Garippo went on to achieve his law degree DePaul University in 1955 and pursue his career as a criminal prosecutor.  Professional career  Initially after Garippo's graduation from law school he was enrolled in the United States Army for two years before his first employment as an attorney. From the years of 1958 to 1968 he worked in the criminal division of the State's Attorney's office with the concluding title as first assistant state's attorney. In 1961 Garippo made contributions to the trial involving Richard Morrison and eight Chicago police offices known as the Summerdale Scandal. Morrison a self-proclaimed master burglar was arrested in 1959 in connection to a string of burglaries in Chicago in the years which had proceeded. In the months that followed the arrest the fact that Morrison was aided in these crimes by eight Chicago police officers came to light and he was released based on plea bargain for a testimony to convict those officers who had aided him. The most notable case during his duration in the State's attorney's office was assisting prosecution who was convicting Richard Speck in 1966. Richard Speck, infamous for the serial murders of eight Chicago nurses on the night of July 14, 1966 was convicted by the efforts of William J. Martin and Garippo. The result being Speck was sentenced to death however the sentence was ultimately overturned due a 1972 supreme court decision to abolish the death penalty for the time being. The case also served precursor for cases later to come in Garippo's career which also involved serial murder. Garippo's time as a judge began with election to the bench of the Cook County Circuit Court in 1968 and concluded with his retirement in 1980. In 1970 Garippo issued a ruling which required journalists comply with a court subpoena under the event that they possessed evidence which would aid a potential conviction which was ground breaking for the time. The most notable moment of his career occurred in his final year as a presiding judge following the arrest of John Wayne Gacy on December 21, 1978. One of the most infamous serial murderers of the 20th century, John Wayne Gacy was arrested and tried for the murder of 33 young men who were buried under his house in Norwood Park Township, Illinois. Gacy's defense argued criminal insanity against the prosecution of William Kunkle, however Gacy was found guilty in spring of 1980. His sentences handed down by Garippo included 21 natural life sentences and 12 death sentences. Gacy remained on death row for 14 years before his death by lethal injection in 1994 at Stateville Correctional Center. In 1980 following the Gacy trial judge Garippo retired from the bench to pursue the remainder of his career in private practice. In the year 2000 he was hired to write a report which covered fully the details which surrounded the controversy of Chief Illiniwek being a racially based mascot. The report did not include any recommendations but the mascot was retired in 2007.  Personal life  Louis lived the majority of his life in Glenview, Illinois with his partner Colette and was the father of four children. He died on May 31, 2016 at an assisted living facility in Glenview as result of congestive heart failure at 84 years old.

Nazi Germany, Swiss exile (1933-1939) In January 1933 the political backdrop was transformed when the Nazi Party took power and converted Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Political activity - except in support of the Nazi Party - became illegal. At the end of February the Reichstag fire was instantly blamed on the Communists, and in March 1933 those identified as Communists began to be arrested. During 1933 Margarete Wittkowski emigrated to Switzerland, where she enrolled at Basel University and worked on her doctorate dissertation. She passed the oral element of her doctoral exam, for which she was supervised by Edgar Salin and Herman Schmalenbach, in February 1934, for work concerning the relationships between the big banks in Berlin and German industry. Some sources indicate that she received her doctorate in 1934. She applied to the Budge Foundation for a research stipendium, but was unable to provide the necessary backup information to support a successful application. She was nevertheless able to pursue an academic career, working with J√ºrgen Kuczynski, a distinguished economist and, like her, a refugee from Nazi Germany. The focus of their work was a study entitled \\"Die Wirtschaftspolitik der Barbarei, Hitlers neue europ√§ische Wirtschaftsordnung\\" (\\"The Economics of Barbarism: Hitler's New Economic Order in Europe\\"), which in the end was published in 1942, and concerned the economic policy of the fascist states. The authors attacked the widespread contention that the economy in Nazi Germany was unusually efficient. It was their view that labour output was lower and the accident rate was higher than before 1933, and that earnings growth since then was attributable to monopoly practices, reduced raw material costs, a reduction in emphasis on consumer goods and an extension of working hours. There was also a warning directed at the United States (at this stage still not militarily involved against Germany) that successful conquest by Nazi Germany of Europe and the Soviet Union would give rise to a fascist European bloc capable of flooding the world with cheap manufactured goods. Remarkably, between 1934 and 1938, Wittkowski continued to travel to Germany, while taking care to hasten back to Switzerland when the situation appeared to be becoming too dangerous. In the Spring of 1934 she moved to Berlin where she co-produced a communist trades union newspaper with a like minded comrade called Ullrich Fuchs. Early the next year she narrowly escaped arrest, emigrating again to Switzerland in February 1935. She worked on several newspapers for distribution to southern Germany, including an illegal newspaper aimed at farming communities. Other newspapers for which she wrote include the \\"S√ºddeutsche Volksstimme\\" and \\"S√ºddeutsche Informationen\\". She was also involved in distribution, according to one source making \\"frequent trips to \\"the southern Baden border area where she handed over illegal publications and messages\\". There are references to her having at times undertaken her courier activities under the cover name \\"Hilde\\". There was also at least one visit to Paris, in October 1936, which at this time had become the de facto headquarters of the Germany Communist Party in exile. British exile (1939-1946) In November 1938, a few days after the \\"Kristallnacht\\" pogroms across the border, Wittkowski was arrested in Z√ºrich and expelled from the country for her \\"illegal political activities\\". She lived - now illegally - in Basel for another six months, after which, in April 1939, she succeeded in escaping to England, where her literary collaborator J√ºrgen Kuczynski had been based since 1936. Sources are largely silent over her activities in England during the war years. Unlike many political refugees from Nazi Germany, there is no record of her having been interned as an enemy alien by the English when war broke out, which may well reflect her work with Kuczynski who had excellent connections with elements of the British establishment. It is on record that until 1943 she worked for the Comintern with Harry Pollitt, a leading member of the Communist Party. She appears to have been considered a leader among the exiled German communists in England. Soviet occupation zone (1946-1949) Margarete Wittkowski returned to Berlin in June 1946. The region surrounding the city was now administered as the Soviet occupation zone, although the contentious creation of the Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED) a couple of months earlier had already created a necessary precondition for its relaunch in October 1949 as a new kind of one-party dictatorship, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Wittkowski joined the SED in 1946. J√ºrgen Kuczynski was already back in town, and together they founded a weekly newspaper called \\"Die Wirtschaft\\" (\\"The Economy\\"). She also took charge of the economics section of Neues Deutschland, the newly established mass-circulation daily newspaper of the recently established Socialist Unity Party. Sources nevertheless indicate that Wittkowski objected to being given work as a journalist because she wished to contribute more directly to rebuilding the country. In 1947 or 1948 she joined the German Economic Commission established by the occupation forces. Working closely with , this involved a central role in devising the planned economic model for the new socialist German state. In 1949/50 she attended a course at the Party Academy. There was a study period in Moscow. In 1950/51 she served as vice president on the German Economic Commission for what had become, in October 1949, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). German Democratic Republic (1949-1974) In 1951 Wittkowski was transferred to the Consumer Co-operatives Association, an office she held till 1954. This was a demotion, attributed by one source to an emulation by Walter Ulbricht of Stalin's 1951 purge of \\"zionist conspirators\\". Others, referring to her time in England, are content to point out that during this time \\"those who had emigrated to the West were more likely to be considered as unreliable comrades\\". Whatever the reason for her removal from the German Economic Commission, it does appear that Wittkowski was respected for her formidable intellect, which unlike others she was sometimes willing to deploy in discussions involving Walter Ulbricht, the country's leader. After Stalin died, in March 1953, the East German party leadership became slightly less nervous, and in 1954 she was reinstated as deputy president of what had now become the State Planning Commission, which gave her significant influence over national economic policy. In April 1954 Wittkowski was also elected a member of the powerful Party Central Committee, which under the Leninist power structure employed in East Germany was the real focus of political power. She also sat as a member of the national parliament (\\"Volkskammer\\") between 1952 and 1958, and again between 1963 and 1967. Between 1956 and 1958 Wittkowski found herself increasingly out of line with the leadership, both because of differences over aspects of economic policy and because she sought to open a spirit of wider debate. In a speech delivered on 22 March 1956 to the Central Committee plenum she criticised Ulbricht over his failure to brief Central Committee members on the momentous events at the Soviet 20th Party Congress in Moscow the previous month: she urged a little more openness within the East German Central Committee. Wittkowski advocated greater priority be given to profitability and the needs of the population. At the Central Committee plenum in November 1956 she called for greater decentralisation of economic decision making. Addressing the Central Committee plenum in November 1956, she criticised the \\"bureaucratic\\" actions of many functionaries, which she characterised as discrediting the \\"party and the government\\". She also appealed for a less confrontational policy with socialists in the German Federal Republic, where a court imposed ban on the Communist Party in August 1956 failed to trigger significant protests by West German workers. There were two German states but there was only one German working class. Wittkowski might have taken a lead within the Central Committee in criticising aspects of economic policy, but she was not a lone voice. Inside the Central Committee, Karl Schirdewan and Ernst Wollweber were voicing similar sentiments. Other prominent critics of the party line were , Fred Oel√üner and Fritz Selbmann. However, whereas Wittkowski saw in the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in West Germany a potential ally in support of workers and in opposition to the Adenauer r√©gime, Ulbricht saw the western SPD, even before publication in 1959 of the Godesberg Program, as irredeemably counter-revolutionary. The idea that one might \\"do business\\" with them was a repudiation of valued Stalinist dogma. More generally, he was underwhelmed by her economic and other criticisms. Her advocacy of \\"socialist self-management\\"According to Otto Hinckelmann, \\"Socialist self-management designates a decentralized form of management of enterprises within a socialist economy. In contrast to central planning, under socialist self-management the workers in each enterprise manage the enterprise themselves, typically by means of a worker-elected committee. After 1961, socialist self-management was practiced in Yugoslavia.\\" led to a charge of \\"Managerism\\".According to Otto Hinckelmann, \\"Managerism, as used by communists, refers to a shift in political control from the communist party to the managers of the largest enterprises in the economy. Gorbachev was accused of fostering this during the era of Perestroika (restructuring) in the last years of the USSR.\\" In February 1958 the Central Committee plenum endorsed the orthodox line advocated by General Secretary Ulbricht: Wittkowski underwent a \\"temporary demotion\\". (For the other critics named in the previous paragraph demotion was permanent) She was removed from her deputy presidency of the State Planning Commission and her name was no longer included on the party list for the Volkskammer election that year. She was also resigned from the Central Committee, although her name now appeared on the list of candidates for Central Committee membership, an indulgence not afforded to comrades Schirdewan and Wollweber. She was quickly restored to the State Planning Commission vice-presidency, although now there was more than one vice- president so that her relative stature within the body was diminished. A few years later, after 1961, the economic reforms branded as the \\"New Economic System\\", reflecting a modest loosening of centralised control across the entire \\"Eastern Bloc\\" seemed to acknowledge concerns that had been expressed by Wittkowski three years before. She herself remained at this point outside the Party Central Committee Politburo, but her principal interlocutor within it was Werner Jarowinsky who had been a pupil of her old friend and literary collaborator, J√ºrgen Kuczynski. In February 1961 she resigned from the State Planning Commission for the last time and took up a post as a deputy chair of the Council of Ministers, where her departmental responsibilities covered Trade, Supply, and Agriculture. Over the years there were many deputy chairmen of the Council of Ministers, but Wittkowski was the only woman ever to be numbered among them. She held this post till July 1967. Meanwhile, in 1963 she was readmitted to the Party Central Committee. Margarete Wittkowski's final big job, to which she was appointed in 1967, was the presidency of what was renamed, on 1 January 1968, the East German Central Bank (Staatsbank). She held this position till her death, which took place while she was travelling, at Singen on the southwestern edge of West Germany.

Popescu (February 10, 1881-February 11, 1963) was a Romanian theologian, historian and priest of the Romanian Orthodox Church. Born in D√¢mbovicioara, D√¢mbovi»õa County, his father was a priest. He attended Nifon Seminary in Bucharest from 1893 to 1901, and in 1902 took his high school graduating examination at Saint Sava National College. He attended two faculties at the University of Bucharest, theology and literature, obtaining degrees in 1907 and 1908. From 1910 to 1913, Popescu attended courses in history and Byzantine studies at the University of Vienna, taking a doctorate in history in 1913. He served as a deacon at Zamfira Monastery from 1908 to 1910, at the Romanian Orthodox chapel in Vienna during his time there and, from 1913 to 1920, at Bucharest's Cotroceni Monastery. Between 1919 and 1923, he directed the chancery for the Metropolis of Ungro-Wallachia. Ordained a priest, he served at two parishes: Schitul MƒÉgureanu (1920 to 1926) and Bradu Boteanu (1926 to 1933).

He founded the World Health Summit in 2009. He was Chairman of the Foundation Board of the Charit√© Foundation (2005-2015), editor of the Journal of Molecular Medicine (since 1993), Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces and Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology as well as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Ethnological Museum Dahlem of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation. From 2004 to 2008, he was CEO of the Charit√© ‚Äì Universit√§tsmedizin Berlin. Charit√© on Detlev Ganten's birthday and from 1991 to 2004 Founding Director and CEO of the Max Delbr√ºck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association. MDC founding director Detlev Ganten  Academic and professional career  Ganten completed agricultural training in Elmshorn in 1959 with the agricultural assistant state examination. Following his secondary education he studied medicine in W√ºrzburg and Montpellier (France) from 1962 to 1964 and worked in the surgical ward of the hospital \\"La Mamounia\\" in Marrakesh (Morocco). From 1966 to 1968 he continued his medical studies in T√ºbingen, concluding them with the medical state examination and subsequent internships in T√ºbingen and Emden. In 1968 Ganten received his MD from the University of T√ºbingen followed by a research period (1969 to 1973) at the Clinical Research Institute in Montreal (Canada) affiliated with the University of Montreal. In 1970 he received his license to practice medicine and then in 1973, obtained the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) from McGill University in Montreal. From 1973 to 1991 Ganten worked for the Pharmacological Institute of the University of Heidelberg where he also qualified as a professor in 1974. In 1975 he received a professorship in Pharmacology at the Medical Faculty of Heidelberg University. In 1978 he became specialist in Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacology. On January 1, 1992, Ganten was appointed Founding Director of the Max Delbr√ºck Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC) in Berlin- Buch. His task was to transform the central institutions for cardiovascular research, cancer research and molecular biology of the Academy of Sciences of the GDR into a new national center for health research of the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres. Around the same time (1993) he was offered the chair for Clinical Pharmacology at the Free University of Berlin. In this period he promoted clinical translational research from basic research to clinical application, intensifying the cooperation in the field of basic research at the MDC with the hospitals in Berlin-Buch, the hospitals of the Medical Faculties of the Free University in Berlin-Steglitz (Klinikum Benjamin Franklin) and Wedding (Virchow-Klinikum) and the Medical Faculty of the Humboldt University (Charit√© Campus Mitte). In 2004, the Senate of Berlin appointed Ganten CEO of the Charit√© ‚Äì Universit√§tsmedizin Berlin. Under his direction the locations of academic medicine in East and West Berlin were united. As a result of the merger with the \\"Universit√§tsklinikum Benjamin Franklin\\" of the Free University of Berlin, the Charit√© Berlin became a member of both universities and thus the largest university hospital in Germany. Ganten held the office of CEO of the Charit√© ‚Äì Universit√§tsmedizin until 2008. New CEO at Charit√© The year 2005 saw the establishment of the Charit√© Foundation by donor Johanna Quandt and Ganten. Since then, Ganten has been acting Chairman of the Foundation Board. Charit√© Foundation Board of Trustees Support from the Charit√© Foundation helped to establish an increasingly closer association between the Charit√© ‚Äì Universit√§tsmedizin and the Max Delbr√ºck Center in Berlin-Buch. The formation of the \\"Berlin Institute of Health (BIH)\\" was founded in 2013 through an agreement of the Federal Ministry for Research and Technology and the Senate of Berlin. The BIH provides a joint structure and platform for MDC and Charit√© to strengthen their clinical research initiatives. On occasion of the 300th anniversary of the founding of the Charit√©, Ganten launched the World Health Summit and continues his association as Founding President of this annual Berlin event. In 2013 Ganten was elected co-chair of the Interacademy Medical Panel (IAMP). IAMP Elections of Executive Committee 2013 - 2016  Fields of research  Ganten's major area of research is hypertension. He discovered basic mechanisms underlying the development of hypertension and is investigating the hormonal regulation of hypertension, in particular the renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system. Further key research interests include the genomic and molecular mechanisms of evolution and evolutionary medicine, concepts for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, Public Health, Global Health and Bioethics. His scientific work won Ganten visiting professorships at the University of California in 1983, at the Coll√®ge de France, Paris, in 2010 respectively. Ganten is also an editor of the Journal of Molecular Medicine (since 1993). Ganten has been president and coordinator of numerous scientific conferences, among them: Scientific Meeting of the European and International Societies of Hypertension (Heidelberg 1986, Berlin 2008); Gordon Conference (1997, Italy); and the Annual Meeting of the Society of German Natural Scientists and Physicians (Gesellschaft Deutscher Naturforscher und √Ñrzte, GDN√Ñ ‚Äì Berlin 1998).  Functions in scientific societies and committees  Ganten's functions in scientific societies and committees include: membership in the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities (BBAW); the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities, the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina; the Academia Europaea, the Polish Academy of Sciences; and the Acad√©mie de Berlin. Further memberships include the Health Research Council of the German Federal Ministry for Science and Technology from 1992 to 1997 and the Science Council of the German Federal Government from 1993 to 1998. Ganten was President of the Helmholtz Association of National Research Centers (1997‚Äì2001); and a member of the German Ethics Council from 2001 to 2007.

It was recorded over the course of three live performances and released on the eponymous album The Impostor. The concerto is dedicated to Earl Scruggs, who Fleck lists as his primary inspiration for playing the banjo.  Instrumentation  The concerto is scored for 2 flutes, piccolo, 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 2 trombones, bass trombone, tuba, tympani, percussion, and strings.  Form  The concerto is in three movements: # Infiltration # Integration # Truth Revealed The entire concerto is 36 minutes long.  Composition  The concerto was commissioned by the Nashville Symphony in 2011. The uphill six-month long writing process became the subject of a documentary called How to Write a Banjo Concerto which Fleck co-directed with Sascha Paladino. One of the most challenging parts of the writing process Fleck had to overcome was that he had no experience in writing orchestral music. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Fleck described his ability to read music as \\"rather primitive.\\" He overcame this by writing the orchestral parts in banjo tab, then used computer software to \\"translate\\" the tab into standard music notation. The concerto depicts a \\"heroes' journey, with the banjo in the starring role.\\" The unusual naming of the movements, which he found after composition was completed, relates Fleck's feelings of being an outsider: > A musician like myself can feel that way pretty regularly, even though the > point of much of what I do is to attempt to find ways to fit naturally into > many diverse environments.

Le Guin, first published in 1964. It is the first work of the Hainish Cycle. The story is set on a fictional planet of the star Fomalhaut, and follows a highborn woman as she tries to track down a family heirloom. It was framed by commentary from ethnologists studying the intelligent life-forms of the Fomalhaut system. The story drew from Norse mythology, and explored the concept of time dilation. \\"The Dowry of the Angyar\\" drew comments for its stylistic devices, while a review praised Le Guin's writing as \\"crystalline prose\\". It was later used as the prologue to Le Guin's 1966 novel Rocannon's World. In later publications, the story was given the title \\"Semley's Necklace\\". Setting and framing \\"The Dowry of the Angyar\\" is the first work set in Le Guin's fictional Hainish universe. In this alternate history, human beings did not evolve on earth, but on Hain. The people of Hain colonized many neighboring planetary systems, including Terra (Earth) and Athshe, possibly a million years before the setting of the novels. The planets subsequently lost contact with each other, for reasons that Le Guin does not explain. Le Guin does not narrate the entire history of the Hainish universe at once, instead letting readers piece it together from various works. The novels and other fictional works set in the Hainish universe recount the efforts to re- establish a galactic civilization. Explorers take years to travel between planetary systems, although the journey is shortened for the travelers due to relativistic time dilation, as well as through instantaneous interstellar communication using the ansible, introduced in The Dispossessed. This galactic civilization is known as the \\"League of All Worlds\\". The story is set on a planet of the star Fomalhaut, which is depicted as harboring multiple intelligent species. The species that the protagonist belongs to has a social structure which divides individuals into two categories: \\"Olgyior\\" and \\"Angyar\\", with the former subordinate to the latter. There are two additional species, the Fiia and the Gdemiar. The story depicts the plan soon after \\"starlords\\", who are emissaries of the League of Worlds, have begun to land on the planet and levy taxes on its population. The story is framed by commentary from the League of World's ethnologist Rocannon and the curator of the League's museum on the fictional planet of South Georgia, as they discuss Semley's planet, as well as a description of the intelligent species of the Fomalhaut system, and a comment on Rocannon's own story by an unknown narrator. Plot summary Semley, a highborn Angyar woman, is married at a young age. Despite being from a highborn family, she has less material wealth than many of the members of the household of her husband, and feels threatened by this. Not long after a daughter is born to her, she returns to her family seeking a necklace of mythical beauty that her family once possessed. Her father sends her to the Fiia, who profess no knowledge of it. She then turns to the Gdemiar, who manufactured the necklace. They tell her that they can take her to it, in a journey that \\"will last only one long night.\\" She is taken on board a spaceship to a museum of the League of Worlds, where she meets Rocannon. She asks the museum for her necklace, and they return it to her. Semley returns to her husband's house, where she finds that although she only experienced two days of travel, she has been away for nine years by the planet's calendar; the planet's year lasts 800 days, and so Semley has been away nearly 20 Earth years. Her husband is now dead, and her daughter a grown woman. In her grief, Semley abandons the necklace and runs into the wilderness. Themes A torc, or necklace, like that featured in the Br√≠singamen myth In an introduction to the story written for a later anthology, Le Guin said that \\"Dowry of the Angyar\\" was most characteristic of her early science fiction writing. She described it as the most romantic of her works, saying that she had steadily moved away from explicit romanticism. She wrote \\"the candor and simplicity of [Dowry of the Angyar] have gradually become something harder, stronger, more complex.\\" Reviewer Amy Clarke wrote that the story might have been inspired by \\"Br√≠singamen\\", a Norse myth about the necklace of the goddess Freyja. She stated that the nocturnal Gdemiar in Le Guin's story were the analogs of the dwarves in the Norse myth, while the diurnal Fiaa were similar to the elves. Scholar Donna White also argued that Dowry of the Angyar was a retelling of the myth of Freyja's necklace. A commentary in Science Fiction Studies stated that the story mixed Norse mythology with the notion of time dilation from Einsteinian relativistic physics. According to scholar Kim Kirkpatrick, Semley's story is told through Rocannon, making Semley more of a passive object. Additionally, Semley as a character is shown as not being self-aware in the way Rocannon is, and especially unaware of the consequences of her action in travelling on the spaceship. Scholar Richard Erlich wrote that the protagonist of the story gets the object of her quest at the end, but at a high price. Therefore, Erlich states that the story teaches a message of caution, a message that is found elsewhere in folklore. The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction described the story as exploring the subjective nature of time in the folkloric concept of Faerie, and providing a \\"Technofantasy justification\\" for it. Semley's journey lasts a single night or two, but cruelly she discovers too late that time dilation has resulted in many years having elapsed at home. Publication and reception \\"Dowry of the Angyar\\" was written in 1963, and published in the science fiction magazine Amazing Stories in 1964. It was incorporated as the prologue (titled \\"Prologue: The Necklace\\") into the 1966 novel Rocannon's World, which was Le Guin's first novel. It was later reprinted as the first story in the 1975 collection The Wind's Twelve Quarters. In later printings the story was titled \\"Semley's Necklace\\". It was anthologized in the 1992 collection The Oxford Book of Science Fiction Stories. An obituary for Le Guin in the web publication The Conversation described the story as the \\"finest of its kind\\" in the genre of fantasy, and went on to say that its \\"crystalline prose [was] equal to Semley‚Äôs tragic fate\\". A review of The Wind's Twelve Quarters in a teachers' journal referred to the story as a \\"valuable reading experience\\". The style and structure of the story were commented upon by several reviewers. Kirkpatrick found that \\"The Dowry of the Angyar\\" used stylistic devices frequently used later by Le Guin. These included as directly addressing the reader in a manner that engaged the audience in creating the story, and involving the central character in an identity-related guessing game. Kirkpatrick stated that although the story is seemingly focused on Semley, in some respects Rocannon is the main character. As a scientist, he studies and questions Semley, thus both depicting and objectifying her as an alien \\"other\\" and likening his own perspective to that of the audience, whose curiosity about Semley's story he shares. A 2015 literary commentary suggested that within the story Le Guin used two styles that alternated. The framing story, set in a museum of the Ekumen, used scientific and technical language, in keeping with the character of Rocannon, a style typical of conventional science fiction. Semley's journey, on the other hand, was told with a \\"poetic shaping of language\\" that the author found more typical of fantasy, or \\"science fantasy\\". The commentary described this combination as a \\"very interesting compositional operation\\".

It is grouped into eight thematic sections and contains nineteen stories, many appearing in one of Mailer's miscellanies; thirteen were published in periodicals or other anthologies before appearing in this collection. The collection was reprinted in hardcover in 1980 and some of the stories were reprinted in other volumes. The collection ranges from stories that are only a couple of sentences, like \\"It\\", to longer novellas, like \\"A Calculus at Heaven\\". All included texts represent Mailer's early career, from his first published short story in 1941 while an undergraduate at Harvard to experimental stories from the mid-sixties. The tales range in content from war to urban life to science fiction, each managing to address the conflict between the individual and the social demands that echo throughout Mailer's oeuvre. Styles differ between stories, ranging from his early narrative approach of The Naked and the Dead to the more mature form found in Advertisements for Myself. The Short Fiction of Norman Mailer illustrates Mailer's early development as an influential voice in 20th-century American letters. Background A prevalent theme throughout Mailer's stories is the individual's struggle against forces that seek homogeneity and conformity. Gabriel Miller states that \\"Mailer's early fiction clearly warns that modern man is in danger of losing his dignity, his freedom, and his sense of self before the enormous power of politics and society\\". Reflecting a recurring theme in Mailer's work, \\"repetition kills the soul\\", Mailer's short fiction illustrates the attempts to keep the individual spirit alive against the twentieth-century forces of consumerism, technology, and totalitarianism. Often, Mailer sees psychoanalysis as a negative social force that dulls the senses and the psyche, as Andrew Gordon observes: \\"Mailer has used psychoanalysis in a very conscious and sophisticated way in his fiction. He also has carried on a crusade, both in his essays and his fiction, against the power of psychoanalysis in popular culture.\\" In many ways, Mailer's early short fiction represents his quest to find a voice \\"compatible with his recurrent themes and emerging vision.\\" Introduction In his introduction, Mailer details his conflicted attitude toward the short story and casts doubt on his own abilities to write a good one. This claim, however, might just be a way for Mailer to mitigate any negative criticism and show modesty by denying his abilities, or as a ruse to get us to discover for ourselves whether Mailer can write a good short story. Yet, Mailer had a general dislike for short stories, and tended to write them when the more serious occupation of writing novels was not going well, or when he had doubts that he was ever meant to be a writer. In fact, Mailer states, that his own short fiction is \\"neither splendid, unforgettable, nor distinguished\\" and implies that he is more a \\"novelist, philosopher, essayist, journalist, personality, cathartic, spark, or demiurge\\". J. Michael Lennon states that Mailer had an idea that if he was not able to finish a story in a day or two, it was never meant to be written. While it's true that Mailer's reputation as a novelist and a practitioner of new journalism are his chief claims to fame, Eric Heyne suggests that, contrary to Mailer's perhaps disingenuous claims, his short fiction is important, as it demonstrates a distinct arc in his development as a writer from his early work to his more mature style, and shows its literary and historical importance in the transition from modernism to postmodernism. The Disappearance of the Ego Part one consists of two short stories written in 1960. The Killer: A Story First published in Evergreen Review in 1964, \\"The Killer: A Story\\" is a first-person account of a male prisoner's parole hearing. The prisoner's thoughts consider his moral character and perspectives on life, like what qualities one needs to be viewed favorably: \\"Good to be slim, trim, shipshape, built the way I am, provided you are modest\\". He focuses on the negative parts of being on parole; however, he is happy to be out of prison because he has to be a repetitive drone in order to remain unnoticed. Truth and Being: Nothing and Time Subtitled \\"A Broken Fragment from a Long Novel\\", \\"Truth and Being: Nothing and Time\\" first appeared in Evergreen Review 26, 1962. Mailer wrote it after being released from Bellevue for the stabbing of his wife Adele. In \\"Truth\\", Mailer writes a fictitious, first-person account about having cancer, or as he describes the story: \\"an odd, even exceptional, essay about: shit. Literally\\". This short story is an extended metaphor and reminiscent of Borges about a \\"rebellion of the cells\\". Lennon explains that this story is best understood in the context of Mailer's Manichean view of the cosmos: feces is one of the battlegrounds in the fight between good and evil. The Air of the Dying The second part consists of two short stories. A Calculus at Heaven Mailer wrote Calculus during his senior year at Harvard for Robert Hillyer's English A-5 when he was 20-years-old. It was originally published in 1944 in Cross- Section: A Collection of New American Writing, his first publication in a book. In the style of Dos Passos, A Calculus at Heaven is a third-person novella that Mailer said \\"is not of the first quality\\", but makes \\"an interesting contrast to The Naked and the Dead,\\" his first novel about World War II. What he meant, explains Merrill, is that this version of combat is informed only by popular culture‚Äîby what he deems \\"the liberal mentality\\"‚Äîthat can only guess and has not experienced. Even though he had yet to be drafted, Mailer was keen to engage the war in his writing, especially since he had been reading Malraux and Hemingway. Like NAD, it is set in the Pacific Theater during World War II, and shares its \\"hovering, brooding, sympathetic narrative consciousness\\". Inspired by the drawn-out battle for Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands, its mood is somber. Five American soldiers who are heavily outnumbered by the enemy have direct and strict orders to maintain complete control of the nearby coastal road at all costs. Surrounded by the Japanese on the fictional island of Trinde, the soldiers contemplate their seemingly inevitable demise. Its ending seems inspired by Hemingway. As they smoke what might be their last cigarettes, the captain notices that it will be a sunny day. \\"Yes,\\" someone answers, \\"sometimes you want to look pretty carefully at it\\". Advertisements for Myself on the Way Out Subtitled \\"Prologue to a Long Novel\\", this story was originally published in Partisan Review 25, fall 1958, and is told from the perspective of Marion Faye, the protagonist of Mailer's novel The Deer Park, in Provincetown, MA. J. Michael Lennon states that this story \\"emphasizes the perilous, confused, or mutable condition of its teller\\". The protagonist, like many of Mailer's narrators, sees himself as disembodied: a \\"ghost, geist, demiurge, dog, bud, flower, tree, house, or some lost way-station of the divine\\", that Lennon sees as an attempt, God-like, to figure out or create his destiny. Poor Kids The third part consists of two short stories. The Greatest Thing in the World Written during his sophomore year at Harvard, \\"The Greatest Thing in the World\\" was Mailer's first publication. It appeared in the Harvard Advocate in 1941. In a 1944 letter, Mailer confessed the story was inspired by a real-life \\"hitch-hiking tour which [he] embarked on quite Byronically, and in retrospect, masochistically\\". It contains strong characterizations, a fast-paced plot, and a tension through the protagonist's tempting of fate. It won Story magazine's eighth annual college contest in the same year, which Mailer later stated was the \\"first powerful and happy event of my career\\" and gave him the certainty that he was \\"meant to be a writer\\". In a 1964 interview, Mailer said this honor \\"fortified him,\\" leading to his writing No Percentage in two months: \\"It was just terrible. But I never questioned any longer whether I was started as a writer\\". In a 1948 interview, Mailer opined that \\"Thing\\" would \\"probably make a wonderful movie someday\\", and later said \\"it reads like the early work of a young man who is going to make a fortune writing first-rate action, western, gangster, and suspense pictures\\". This Depression-era story begins with Al Groot bargaining for coffee and a doughnut. He reminisces about having more money then hitches a ride with three strangers. He lies to them and says he has more money than he actually has. After gambling on a pool game and winning, Groot angers the other men when he insists on quitting. The men beat him up, threaten him, and drive off with him in the car. He escapes by jumping out of the car. In this naturalistic world, Mailer depicts the occasional sensual victory as all that individuals can hope for. The \\"greatest thing in the world\\", then, is the individual's little win in the face of ostensibly mightier forces. Maybe Next Year \\"Maybe Next Year\\" was written at Harvard for Theodore Morrison's English A-3 and published in Harvard Advocate in 1942. It depicts young boy's observations of his contentious parents. Mailer wrote this story during his junior year and combines his reading of Faulkner and his feelings about family and childhood in a coming-of-age story in which the young boy must prove his masculinity in a world dominated by his mother's oppression. \\"Maybe Next Year\\" might begin Mailer's life-long obsession with dirt and anal imagery in a quest to \\"dirty himself in freedom\\". Ultimately, states Rollyson, it's about longing for power and control. The narrator continuously runs away from his nagging and domineering mother and defeated father by retreating into the nearby woods where he encounters hoboes on the railroad. Due to the statements made by his mother, \\"They're filthy old things, you'll get sick and die, they're diseased, they're diseased\\", the boy insults and stones an injured tramp. The boy feels satisfied and grown-up seeing two men cry. In the story's reprint in Advertisements for Myself, Mailer states that its \\"prose is Salinger-ish, but the inspiration was by Faulkner\\". Sobrieties, Impieties The fourth part consists of five short stories about World War II, written 1951‚Äì53. While \\"The Notebook\\" and \\"MacDougal Alley\\" are not war stories, they were written about the same time, so are included in this section. The Paper House \\"The Paper House\\" was first published in New World Writing: Second Mentor Collection in 1952 and is based on an anecdote told to Mailer by Vance Bourjaily. It is set in occupied Japan in 1951. Hayes and Nicholson are American Army men stationed there for the war. Mailer writes the story from Nicholson's point of view by seeing his acquaintance's distaste for women. The two army men become regulars at a geisha house where they meet Yuriko and Mimiko. Hayes falls in love with Yuriko; however, she tells his friend Nicholson that he doesn't trust her. After a fight, Yuriko tells Hayes that she will commit hari-kari. Before she can commit the act, Hayes and Nicholson return to the geisha house to stop her. The Notebook Originally written, according to Mailer, in \\"an hour,\\" \\"The Notebook\\" was first published in Cornhill Magazine in 1953. According to his biographer, Mailer turned a real-life situation with Adele Morales, his second wife, into this story and underlines a credo for Mailer: \\"a promise never to hide his motives from himself, no matter how ignoble\\". Set in 1951, it concerns an unnamed writer and his unhappy girlfriend. Much of the story shows the writer's inner monologue about his creative process, and his compulsory need to record everything in his notebook. The girlfriend complains that he is an observer and not a participant in her life, making him question his intentions and his love for her. He decides he loves her and hides his notebook. The Language of Men Based on Mailer's experience as an army cook, \\"The Language of Men\\" was first published in Esquire in April 1953 ‚Äì the first of over 40 for Esquire ‚Äì and is Mailer's most autobiographical story. Mailer states: \\"I didn't think of all the specific things then. I just thought of it as a lousy job. But then I started to write the story, and a lot came back that I'd forgotten; and the experience of being an Army cook was a lot more real for me while I was writing than when it had happened\\". Like Mailer, the protagonist Sanford Carter is given the job of a cook in occupied Japan after the end of World War II ‚Äî a job neither the writer or his character liked. Carter attempts to make improvements, but he becomes resentful when the men do not seem to appreciate his efforts. The same may have been true for Mailer. The Patron Saint of MacDougal Alley Originally titled \\"Pierrot\\" and published in World Review (1953), Mailer made small revisions and changed the name to \\"The Patron Saint of MacDougal Alley\\" before republishing it in AFM and SFNM. In \\"The Patron Saint of MacDougal Alley,\\" Mailer describes a man's interactions with a man named Pierrot. The story follows Pierrot as he constantly moves between multiple places; however, he cannot seem to find a home. The Dead Gook First published in Discovery, No. 1 in December 1952, is about a jungle patrol in the Philippines and based on Mailer's experience with the Filipino Huks, communist partisans, in Luzon and a memorable patrol to find and destroy some Japanese marines. This experience also influenced the naturalism of NAD. The story focuses on Private Brody and Sergeant Lucas. The regiment is approached by a group of Filipino men that claim to have heard gunfire nearby and think there is an American or resistance fighter involved. Brody starts to wonder if anyone will cry for him if he dies. The regiment finds a dead resistance fighter and returns his body to the village to be buried. The story ends with Brody crying for the dead resistance fighter. Dark to Dawn, Dawn to Dark The fifth part consists of two short stories. Great in the Hay Dated 1951, \\"Great in the Hay\\" is a two-page short story that reads like a fairy tale, complete with a moral: \\"People who live in the dark live longest of all\\". Al and Bert live similar lives: they look the same, they both produce films, and they are both married. However, Al is known for being \\"good in the hay\\" while Bert is known for only caring about money. Bert obsesses about this difference and hires a private investigator to try to find out Al's secret. Bert finds out the reasons why women love Al, but remains unsatisfied. Al later kills himself because he is depressed, increasing Bert's confusion. The Last Night: A Story Originally published in Esquire in December 1963, Mailer later worked this story into an unpublished screenplay with wife Norris Church Mailer about a Noah's Ark spaceship. It was the last short story Mailer would write, and in 1984, he released a limited edition of the story. \\"The Last Night: A Story\\" is a science fiction tale about the end of the world. A plan to create a civilization on Mars fails because more radiation is found there. After it is discovered that the whole solar system is poisoned by radiation, the only option left is to blow up the Earth and use the force from the explosion to propel a rocket with one hundred people and animals to another galaxy. The treatment ends with the rocket propelling toward the stars and out of the solar system. Victor Peppard praises \\"The Last Night: A Story\\" as a story that gives new nuance to science fiction: \\"Mailer is able to embody his polemic with modern science in an artistic form grounded in a number of rich literary antecedents and traditions, which ultimately take science fiction to a higher place\\". Microbes The sixth part consists of two experimental short stories. It First published in AFM and the shortest story in the collection, \\"It\\" is four sentences and thirty-six words long. It's the first- person account of a soldier's own decapitation. The Shortest Novel of them All The only new story in for SFNM, \\"The Shortest Novel of Them All\\" is a twelve-sentence, romantic tragedy that follows a couple through courtship and marriage. Mutants The seventh part consists of two short stories. Ministers of Taste: A Story \\"Ministers of Taste: A Story\\" features two real letters written to Robert B. Silvers, editor of the New York Review of Books, that appeared in Partisan Review. Neither letter can be located in the original source, but both are reprinted in Mailer's Selected Letters. The first letter was written on February 22, 1965. Both letters feature Mailer detailing his disappointment in his working relationship with Silvers after he fails to submit two of Mailer's novels to the NYRB despite Mailer's numerous favors for him. In the second letter written on April 4, 1965, Mailer gives Silvers an ultimatum: publish the novels or lose him as a client. Despite the discontent, the second letter ends with Mailer referring to Silvers as his devoted friend. The Locust Cry Originally published in February 1963 in Mailer's bi-monthly column in Commentary, \\"The Locust Cry\\" is actually two short stories, \\"The Test\\" and \\"Upsetting the Bowl,\\" that are commentaries on Martin Buber's Tales of the Hasidim. =The Test= Prince Adam Czartoryski has been married for many years. However, he and his princess cannot conceive a child. Prince Adam travels to the maggid of Koznitz and asks to be prayed for. Soon after, the prince and his princess are fortunate enough to conceive a son. The prince tells his brother about his blessing, but his brother think it is a joke. The two travel to the maggid of Koznit so that the brother can get prayer for his ill son. They are told to leave by the maggid and the son dies before they make it home. =Upsetting the Bowl= Rabbi Elimelekh raises and pours a bowl of soup among the table as he and his disciples sit around the table. This causes one of the disciples to get upset. The Rabbi tells the disciple to not be afraid. The whole Jew country becomes edict. The consciousness of the man in this story is portrayed as an evil atheist who performs ungodly activities. The man worries and has to do the same thing each day. If one thing goes wrong, so does the rest of the day. Then one day it becomes clear and the man becomes grateful and a believer in God. Clues to Love The eighth part consists of two short stories, probably Mailer's finest and most well-known. The Time of Her Time In \\"The Time of Her Time\\", Sergius O'Shaugnessy, a Village playboy, struggles to satisfy Denise Gondelman. Mailer intended \\"Time\\" to be a part of a long novel, but published it instead as a short story in AFM in 1959. Before publication, Mailer wrote to Dwight Macdonald and thirteen other critics to solicit support for publication in order to avoid potential legal trouble. After the US publication, Mailer writes Andr√© Deutsch, his publisher in England, to argue the merits of \\"Time\\" and why it should be published. Originally, a censored version was published in England, but the full text was printed in a subsequent 1968 edition. Enid Stubin describes \\"The Time of Her Time\\" as a satire that depicts the realities of human relationships: \\"The sly and affectionate substance of this 'notorious' story places 'The Time of Her Time' well ahead of its time as a satirical meditation on the roles of men and women in and out of love\\". Andrew Gordon considers \\"Time\\" as a forerunner to An American Dream: the two works share subject matter and setting, so \\"'Time' can be considered a test run for Dream\\", though more ironic and self-mocking and, therefore, more \\"acceptable\\". Critics like Raines and Heyne see the relationship between Sergius and Denise as a battle, both suggesting that while Denise is empowered ‚Äî now \\"a real killer\\" ‚Äî and moves on at the end, Sergius is left defeated and emasculated. Mailer has been criticized for \\"tired stereotypes\\" of women, Jews, and blacks in \\"The Time of Her Time\\", and it remains a controversial short story, but one of his best. In 1979, Mailer chose \\"Time\\" as his best short story; he writes in his preface that choosing this story was easy because his \\"credentials as a writer of short stories are, say the word, compact\\". The Man Who Studied Yoga This novella was originally published in New Short Novels 2, 1956, which Mailer originally intended to be the first of a series of eight novels. In Mailer's original conception, \\"Yoga\\" was to be the prologue to an eight-novel series. Sam aspires to write a novel, but makes his living writing continuity for comic strips. He is not a heroic figure, but one that struggles with daily life and truly wants to improve. Sam, states Heyne, despises his bourgeois life, but surrenders to it, perhaps making him the object of Mailer's derision. \\"The Man Who Studied Yoga\\" is perhaps Mailer's sole excursion into middle-class normalcy: Sam and Eleanor seem to have a successful, if somewhat boring, suburban life, but it is soon interrupted by watching a pornographic movie with friends. Overstimulated by the movie, Sam dreams of Louis XV's garden of virgins called the Deer Park which becomes the title of Mailer's third novel about Hollywood. In fact, Mailer writes in his journal that finishing \\"Yoga\\" gave him the necessary drive and confidence to write The Deer Park. The narrator is first-person, omniscient: \\"I would introduce myself if it were not useless. The name I had last night will not be the same as the name I have tonight\\". This might be a conscious echo of the opening of Melville's Moby- Dick: \\"Call me Ishmael\\", or perhaps a contemporary bathos. The title of the novella alludes to an old joke, also alluding to Moby-Dick. One of Sam's friends tells a shaggy dog story of a man who goes to India to study yoga, echoing Pip's passing mention of a joke in Melville's novel: he unscrews his navel, thinking he is on the verge of a revelation, and his ass falls off. This instance seems to suggest Sam's reluctance or inability to take risks or do anything to break the monotony of his routine life. His navel gazing is what makes him the object of Mailer's scorn and drains his life of significance. The film inspires a dread in the couple who realize that they, in Trilling's reading, \\"ache with the sexual longings that are never to be satisfied, and with the frustration of their dreams of themselves.\\" In short, Mailer shows that in order to conform to society without violating its established norms \\"is purposeless death.\\" Sam turns to psychoanalysis for assistance, but Mailer's satiric language makes it clear that he aligns this practice with conformity and its efficacy remains suspect. The novella ends in what is perhaps another echo of Melville ‚Äî this time Bartleby: Diana Trilling calls \\"The Man Who Studied Yoga\\" \\"one of the best stories of our time and aesthetically Mailer's best-integrated piece of fiction\\".

Working for the Destour party, at first, it later became part of the Neo-Destour then the Socialist Destourian Party, since its foundation on March 2, 1934, in Ksar Hellal. It gathered nationalist activist like B√©chir M'hedhbi, co-founder of the journal and its first editor in chief, Mahmoud El Materi, Bahri Guiga, M'hamed Bourguiba, Ali Bouhajeb and Tahar Sfar. Becoming a daily newspaper, it pursued its publishing after Tunisia's independence in 1956. Its last edition was published on March 19, 1988. It was replaced the following morning by Le Renouveau newspaper.,  History   Origins and foundation  In the early 1930s, Habib and M'hamed Bourguiba, El Materi, Guiga and Sfar, started writing articles in La Voix du Tunisien, a newspaper owned by Chedly Khairallah, a member of the Destour. Soon, they stood out from their elders of the party thanks to their originality and the way they express the problems and issues related to the Tunisian people. Their new reasoning charmed public opinion as they were in favor of the inviolability of national identity and political sovereignty of the Tunisian people. Furthermore, they advocated for a gradual emancipation of the country while supporting a nationalism that fought against a regime and not against a civilization., They quickly attracted the interest of public opinion but also French preponderants, large landowners and businessmen, who had a great influence on the colonial administration. Thus, they obtained from the French Residence firm measures to end tbe freedom of expression of the five journalists: On May 12, 1931, many nationalist newspapers were censored, including La Voix du Tunisien while the Bourguibas, Guiga, Salah Farhat and El Materi were prosecuted. Nevertheless, they obtained from their friends in Paris, Marius Moutet and Gaston Bergery, the postponing of their hearings to June 9, 1931. Awaiting trial, the journalists expressed their dissatisfaction in a protest campaign. However, thanks to popular pressure the day of trial, the hearings were adjourned once again. That did not please, resident-general, Fran√ßois Manceron, who succeeded in starting an argument between the journalists and Khairallah, over the management of the newspaper, which ended up with their resignation from the journal. Despite that, the group stood in touch and gathered sometimes in Caf√© de la Kasbah or Baghdad restaurant to discuss politics and national news. They were often in the company of French or Tunisian socialists, among whom, the pharmacist, Ali Bouhajeb. Once, while having a talk, they decided to create their own newspaper. A drafting committee was, therefore, created among whom, Habib and M'hamed Bourguiba, Bahri Guiga, Tahar Sfar, Mahmoud El Materi and Ali Bouhajeb, who was also the manager of the publishing company. B√©chir Mhedhbi, a senior year high school student, joined the team to be the copyeditor. As for the headquarters, they were settled in the back room of the Bouhageb pharmacy, It was in a context of Great Depression, when the low classes suffered hard conditions, that L'Action Tunisienne published it first edition on November 1, 1932.  Raising popularity  = Defending lower classes = Disappointed by the elders' resigned moderation, the young nationalists raged and defended lower classes. Bouhajeb devoted a whole section to this cause: La Voix du guenillard while the other committee members wrote, in turn, in their editorial. Supplied in information by documents provided by administration officials, they soon acquired a large audience. For example, Bourguiba advocated for lower classes rights. He demonstrated the mechanism of colonial exploitation, ascending from effects to causes, while addressing the social phenomena, calling on the workers and students to organize in order to defend themselves against exploitation. = Naturalized Tunisian issue = L'Action Tunisienne organized a campaign to protest against the Naturalized Tunisian issue. The campaign was a total success raising the journalists from Destour activist to members of the executive committee of the party.  Later activism to independence  L'Action was a platform for nationalists who expressed their dissatisfaction with the protectorate. Among its famous journalists were Bourguiba, H√©di Nouira and many others.  Post-independence  After obtaining independence on March 20, 1956, L'Action Tunisienne maintained its activism as the Neo Destour newspaper then the Socialist Destourian Party one until it was replaced with Le Renouveau.

The book engages with the work of many scholars who have written on the subject, including Carol Adams, Alasdair Cochrane, Gary Francione, Melanie Joy, Martha Nussbaum, and Peter Singer, as well as with the views of non-specialists, including slaughterhouse workers involved with the film Slaughterhouse: The Task of Blood, released by Century Films in 2005.  Basic idea  The key question dealt with in the book is whether the consumption of products derived from the bodies of animals should be banned. The position that Deckers adopts is unusual in that he argues that this question must be resolved by addressing the question of what is optimal for human health, where Deckers argues for an unconditional duty to maximise positive global health impacts, which is tantamount to a duty to minimise negative global health impacts. Applied to the consumption of animal products, this duty transpires into the duty to commit to qualified moral veganism: vegan diets ought to be the default diets for the majority of the human population.  Synopsis  In the first chapter, Deckers abstracts from some of the deeper questions associated with this topic by focusing on the narrow global health impacts, ignoring the question how nonhuman organisms ought or ought not to be treated when human beings make decisions about what to eat. The chapter reveals that, in many situations, omnivorous and vegetarian diets produce more narrowly defined negative global health impacts than vegan diets. The survey is limited mainly to how different diets impact on zoonoses, as well as to how they impact on land, water, fossil fuels, and atmospheric resources. It is also argued that omnivorous and vegetarian diets result in significant negative health impacts upon the lives of those who work in the farm animal sector, for example on those who work in slaughterhouses. In chapter two, Deckers argues that human moral agents must move beyond these narrow considerations as our duty to strive for holistic human health cannot be fulfilled unless the interests of nonhuman organisms are also considered. In contrast to mainstream theories in animal ethics, which have argued mainly for duties to avoid inflicting pain, suffering, and death upon other animals and who denounce speciesism, Deckers argues that a good moral theory embraces speciesism and should consider the consumption of animal products in light of an extension of speciesism, which he refers to as ‚Äòanimalism‚Äô, a commitment to give preferential treatment to all individuals in the animal kingdom. On this basis, Deckers argues that, in many situations, plants can be justifiably consumed, whereas animal products, even if they were derived from animals who had not been killed but who had died naturally or accidentally, ought not to be eaten. This prima facie taboo on the consumption of animal products is also brought to bear on the issue presented by those who entertain the idea of genetically engineering animals in the hope that doing so might reduce their capacities to feel pain or to suffer. Another interest that Deckers considers to be relevant in relation to this issue is the human interest in safeguarding the integrity of nature. Drawing on the worldview of Alfred North Whitehead, Deckers argues that the genetic engineering of animals presents a greater threat to this interest compared to conventional methods of breeding animals, which are, incidentally, not free from the concern that they fail to safeguard the integrity of nature either. The human interests in adopting a taboo on the consumption of animal products and in safeguarding the integrity of nature are also brought to bear on the issue presented by another technology that is currently being developed to reduce some of the concerns sketched in the book: the production of lab-grown, cultured, synthetic, or in- vitro flesh. Deckers argues that we should adopt a prima facie duty to allow cells to be where they are, rather than to extract them from animals and to manipulate them to do things outside their natural contexts inside Petri dishes. However, he argues also that this duty might be overridden by the greater duty to curtail the human consumption of conventional animal products. In addition, Deckers argues that, if the assumptions that domesticated cats cannot maintain good health on vegan diets and that they must consume some flesh are correct, the development of in-vitro flesh in order to feed them would be appropriate. Chapter two culminates in the development of a theory which Deckers calls qualified moral veganism. His commitment to veganism is qualified as Deckers's theory does not demand that people abstain from eating animal products in all situations. It is a moral rather than a dietary position that can be adopted by everyone, even by those who have very good reasons not to adopt vegan diets. It is a vegan theory in the sense that vegan diets ought to be the default diets for the majority of the human population. Chapter three sets out the political project that is associated with this theory, the vegan project, which strives to bring about legal and political reform in all jurisdictions across the globe to introduce qualified bans on the consumption of animal products. The vegan project does not stand or fall if governments either fail to relate to some of the interests that Deckers brings to bear on the issue or do not ascribe the same weight to them. Rather, Deckers argues that something like the vegan project can also be justified merely by appealing to the much narrower range of human health concerns that are discussed in chapter one. Chapter three also refutes three objections that have been raised against the vegan project. The first is that it would be pointless in view of the fact that many people are not prepared to embrace it; the second that it should be rejected as it would jeopardise human food security unjustifiably; and the third that the vegan project alienates human beings from the natural world. In chapter four Deckers explores what other people think about qualified moral veganism by evaluating a number of discussions that others have had on the topic of the book. It engages with the views of academics and non-specialists, including slaughterhouse workers. Deckers argues that qualified moral veganism stands firm in spite of public opposition, and he also sheds some light on some of the key obstacles towards its wider acceptance, including the roles played by cultural and religious traditions. Deckers recognises that many people believe that vegan diets are nutritionally deficient, which is why the appendix of the book engages with the nutritional literature, concluding that carefully chosen vegan diets are nutritionally adequate.

She argues that Deckers's focus on holistic human health highlights a moral concern with the consumption of animals who die naturally or accidentally, an issue that has been largely overlooked by scholars in animal ethics.Mancilla, A.

History  The ecological medicinal Ecoherbes park was inaugurated on the 20th of June 2015 and opened its doors to the public on the 21st of June, at the summer solstice. It is a project that has been born and is being developed with the objective of providing, in situ, knowledge of the plants and their use in current medicine and traditions. Visitors can walk freely through the gardens or explore it with a guide.  Collections  The garden houses more than 400 species of medicinal, aromatic and culinary plants from different parts of the world. Together with the plants, there is a large biodiversity of native trees and shrubs surrounded by a combination of farmlands and the Mediterranean and natural park of the Ebro Delta in the background. The 2 hectare botanic garden is situated in a 10 hectare archaeological park. In its construction, all the morphology of the land has remained, such as the centenary dry stone walls and many trees that are still alive, such as the Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), the olive tree (Olea europea) some of which are thousands of years old and the carob tree (Ceratonia siliqua) that is over 300 years old. The garden is structured by paths that provide many routes and where the plants are distributed micro-climatologically, taking into account the exposure to the sun, wind and humidity. The flower beds facilitate drainage and soil aeration, leading to an optimum structure for the root system of the plants. All the different species are planted individually in their own flower beds, making is easier to adjust the substrate and to attend to the plant with any specific needs. Each plant has a placard explaining the properties of each species, what it is used for, its common and scientific name and where is originates from. Plants Ecoherbes Park The garden has the following collections: Rosmarinus, Thymus, Salvia, Menta, Albahaca, Artemisa, Echinacea, Geranium, Tanacetum, Achillea, Kalanchoe, Origanum, Cymbopogon, Plectranthus, Satureja, Leonorus, Lavandula and other medicinal plants from different continents. Within the enclosure, forming part of the garden, is the so-called Witches' Corner, where highly toxic, poisonous and psychotropic plants are located. This area is restricted for underage visitors. The garden is also a reservation area for species that are in danger of extinction. There is a seed bank or gymnosperm which has its own reproduction nursery where many of the species are experimented on for climate adaption.

History In 1911, newly elected Governor Francis E. McGovern laid out his progressive vision for Wisconsin, which included a proposal for a recall. The next week, State Senator Paul O. Husting introduced Senate Joint Resolution 9, which allowed for the recall of every office holder in the state, including both those elected and appointed. Several senators did not like that the recall also applied to judges, and attached an exemption for judges. The bill passed the Senate 20-7. The bill was then passed by the Assembly 64-1. Since proposed amendments to the Wisconsin Constitution must pass two consecutive legislatures before going to the people for a vote, Husting introduced his bill again on February 11, 1913.State.wi.us, Wisconsin Constitution Article XII. Retrieved August 1, 2016. The bill passed the Senate 26-1, and the Assembly 72-17. The proposed amendment then when to the voters, who, in November 1914, voted it down by a margin of 64 percent to 36 percent. A second attempt at a recall amendment came in 1923, when Senator Henry Huber introduced Senate Joint Resolution 39, which allowed for the recall of public officials. It passed the Senate 17-12, and the Assembly 60-10. In 1924, Huber was elected Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin, so the second introduction of the resolution was taken up by Max W. Heck. It passed the Senate 22-8, and the Assembly 70-22. The resolution was scheduled to appear on the November 2, 1926 ballot. There was strong opposition to the proposed amendment, because it allowed for the recall of state judges. Organizations, such as the State Bar of Wisconsin, the Milwaukee Bar Association, Archbishop Sebastian Gebhard Messmer and the editorial boards of the Milwaukee Journal and the Milwaukee Sentinel. The proposed amendment also had its supporters, including the editorial board of the Wisconsin State Journal, the Wisconsin State Federation of Labor, and U.S. Senator Robert M. La Follette Jr. The amendment passed, by a margin of 50.6 percent to 49.4 percent. In 2011, State Senator Jim Holperin became the first state legislator to be subject to a recall in two different legislative bodies: the Assembly in 1990, and the State Senate in 2011. In 2012, Governor Scott Walker became the first governor in U.S. history to survive a recall. Legislation summary 1926 creation The recall was officially created in November 1926 by constitutional amendment. The rules established in the constitution are: * Voters may petition for the recall of any elected official after the first year of their term * The petition must be signed by voters equal to at least 25 percent of the vote in the last gubernatorial election in the district from which the elected official is to be recalled * A special election will be held between 40 and 45 days from the filing of the petition * The official being recalled will continue to perform their duties until the result of the election is officially declared * Other candidates for the office will be nominated in accordance with normal election rules * The candidate who receives the most votes will serve for the remainder of the term * The name of the elected official who is being recalled will be on the ballot unless they resign within 10 days of the petition being filed * After one successful petition and election, no other recall attempts can be made for the remainder of the term 1981 amendment In 1981, the constitution was amended, which changed the rules for recalls. This amendment changed the rules, which follow: * Voters may petition for the recall of any elected official after the first year of their term * The petition must be signed by voters equal to at least 25 percent of the vote in the last gubernatorial election in the district from which the elected official is to be recalled * A special election will be held on the Tuesday six weeks after the petition is filed, or the next Tuesday if that day is a holiday * The official being recalled will continue to perform their duties until the result of the election is officially declared * Other candidates for the office will be nominated in accordance with normal election rules * If more than two people run for a nonpartisan office, or if more than two people run in the same political party for a partisan office, a recall primary will be held * In the case of a recall primary, the date above will be used, and the general election will be held on the Tuesday four weeks after the primary * The name of the elected official who is being recalled will be on the ballot unless they resign within 10 days of the petition being filed * After one successful petition and election, no other recall attempts can be made for the remainder of the term Recall attempts Successful recalls *1977 recall of Dane County Judge Archie Simonson *1977 recall of five members of the La Crosse School Board'Recall vote removes five in La Crosse,' Racine Journal Times, August 3, 1977, pg. 7A *1992 recall of four members of the La Crosse School Board'La Crosse recall election removes 4 School Board members,' Milwaukee Journal, July 15, 1992, pg.

Preparations for the service began in 2012 originally testing the concept on YouTube. The current service was announced in November 2014. The service was launched in 2015 and promoted as \\"Netflix for News\\" and features ‚Äúcurated but personalized news coverage‚Äù via short video reports. The service offers two services: ‚ÄúReuters Now‚Äù, a constantly- updated customisable, skippable and downloadable news lineup of lasting between 5 and 30 minutes composed of story clips, and uninterrupted live feeds of global events. Reuters TV has both a U.S. and international version of the service with news tailored to both. The stories are chosen by user's interests, time and location (for example, an American viewer is likely to receive longer report of an American-related news story than a French viewer.) Originally costing 1.99 dollars a month, the service was made free in August 2015. In 2016, Reuters launched Reuters TV for publishers.

The film recounts the story of Operation Entebbe, a 1976 counter-terrorist hostage-rescue operation. The film stars Rosamund Pike and Daniel Br√ºhl. It was released in the United States on 16 March 2018 and in the United Kingdom on 11 May 2018. Plot In 1976, two German and two Palestinian terrorists hijacked Air France Flight 139 en route from Tel Aviv to Paris. They held the passengers and crew hostage at Entebbe in Uganda and demanded a ransom of $5 million for the airplane and the release of 53 Palestinian and pro-Palestinian militants, 40 of whom were prisoners in Israel. When all diplomatic efforts failed, the Israeli government decided not to negotiate and approved a counter-terrorist hostage rescue operation by Israeli Defense Force commandos.

On 29 July 2016, Rosamund Pike, Daniel Br√ºhl and Vincent Cassel joined to play the lead roles in the film, with Cassel ultimately not participating. Principal photography on the film began on 14 November 2016 in Malta, and production also took place in the U.K. A real hijacking took place during filming at the Malta International Airport. The film features extensive footage of the noted Batsheva Dance Company, dancing to a modern version of the traditional Jewish song Echad Mi Yodea. One of the characters in the film is a dancer in the troupe, and the dance is shown as the film opens and then throughout the film, intercut with portions of the narrative. Release The film premiered on 19 February 2018 at the 68th Berlin International Film Festival. It was released in the United States on 16 March 2018, and received a release in the United Kingdom on 11 May 2018. Promotion An initial trailer for Entebbe was released on 7 December 2017, using the 1971 song \\"I'd Love to Change the World\\" by the band Ten Years After. Reception Critical reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 24% based on 107 reviews, and an average rating of 5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"7 Days in Entebbe has a worthy story to tell, but loses sight of its most compelling elements in a dull dramatization of riveting real-life events.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 49 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a \\"C\\" and called it competent but pointless, saying: \\"When all the dust settles, we‚Äôre left right where we started, and with nothing to show for it but a fleeting reminder that peace is impossible without negotiation. It‚Äôs a lesson that history has failed to teach us, filtered through a movie that doesn‚Äôt understand why.\\" The Chicago Sun-Timess Richard Roeper gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, writing, \\"All too often in 7 Days in Entebbe, primary characters on all sides of this 1970s period-piece political thriller state the obvious ‚Äî and then state it again, and then have to stand around while someone else states the obvious one more time, just in case the folks in the seats have yet to grasp the stakes at hand and the dilemmas in play.\\" Liel Leibovitz of Tablet criticized the film's downplaying of violence, such as the final raid being \\"shot in infuriating slow-motion and cross-cut with a modern dance performance\\", writing that the lack of violence eliminates the possibility of \\"catharsis\\" and renders the film a \\"vapid and vacuous statement\\". Historical accuracy The film puts Yonatan Netanyahu's death much earlier in the raid on the airport than had been portrayed in previous films on the subject or in the Netanyahu family's version of events. Director Padilha said that this placement was based on interviews with participants in the raid. Although the production had commissioned British historian Saul David's 2015 study Operation Thunderbolt as a guide, the director opted to subordinate historical accuracy to dramatic effect in a number of scenes. Most notably, the division of the hostages and the Air France crew staying with the hostages are presented in a way that contradicts eyewitness accounts gathered by David.

The bridge is south of Stockton-on-Tees town centre and just north of the adjacent Surtees Bridge which carries the A66 road. The bridge is built on the site of a series of Tees Bridges alternating between two adjacent crossing sites.  Previous Rail Bridges in Stockton-on-Tees  Since 1830 there have been a series of railway bridges over the River Tees at this point. To ensure continuity of service, replacement bridges have been constructed adjacent to the current operational bridge.  The 1830 Stockton Railway Bridge  The 1830 bridge was an iron chain suspension bridge built principally to carry coal on the Stockton and Darlington Railway to Port Darlington, later to be renamed Middlesbrough, and was to be the first suspension bridge built for railway traffic. Drawings of the original 1830 Stockton Railway Bridge ;Design The designer was Sir Samuel Brown, a retired naval officer with experience building the 1820 Union Bridge over the River Tweed between Scotland and England, and the Royal Suspension Chain Pier, Brighton (1823). Stockton Railway Bridge was long with a main span of . The wide unstiffened bridge deck was suspended using of round eye bar link chain supported by two masonry towers, giving of clearance (heading) on the river below the deck and there were lattice timber parapets on either side of the deck. The whole structure cost ¬£2,300 and weighed only 113 tonnes--less than the loads it was expected to carry. ;Construction Work was started on the bridge in 1829 and it was opened on 27 December 1830. ;Trials and operation When the first trial steam engine and train of loaded coal wagons crossed the bridge on 27 December 1830, the bridge flexed so much that the unstiffened bridge deck rose like a static wave in front of the engine. One particular trial load was enough to damage the towers with one tower on the Yorkshire side cracking. The bridge was propped mid span using trestles and traffic was restricted to four wagons at a time, spaced apart by chains to spread the load. The trials had shown that this type of suspension bridge was unsuitable for railway traffic and to this day there are no rail suspension bridges in the UK. Suspension bridges were not used successfully for railways until the building of the 1855 Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge in the USA incorporating both road and rail decks. The foundations and submerged remains of the wooden trestles of the 1830 bridge were found during work for the construction of the 2009 Surtees Rail Bridge.  The 1844 Stockton Railway Bridge  The 1830 bridge needed a replacement. With site investigations in 1841 by John Harris, Robert Stephenson designed a five span cast iron trussed girder bridge on piled masonry piers. This was built over the period 1841-1844 by contractor Grahamsley and Read and when it opened in May 1844 it replaced the suspension bridge. The bridge was similar in design to Stephenson's 1846 bridge over the River Dee in Chester that had collapsed in the year following its completion. To ensure the same thing didn't happen at Stockton bridge, props were added and the bridge carried rail traffic until succeeded by the 1881 wrought iron bridge. The 1881 Walter Scott bridge  The 1881 bridge  In 1881 a wrought iron bridge was constructed with five spans of plate girders supported on concrete-filled iron cylinders. When the bridge was superseded by the 1906 bridge the tracks were removed. In 2008-2009 the 1881 bridge was dismantled and removed by Carillion Civil Engineering to make way for the 2009 Surtees Rail Bridge. The 1906 Tees Bridge  The 1906 Tees Bridge  In 1906 a new superstructure was built on the original masonry piers of the 1844 Stevenson bridge using steel plate girders instead of the previous cast iron girders and brought back into use. The downstream 1881 wrought iron bridge was closed and the tracks removed. Due to settlement of the embankment and bridge distress there was a speed restriction imposed on the 1906 bridge. Although no longer carrying rail traffic, the bridge continues to carry rail signalling cables across the River Tees.  The 2009 Surtees Rail Bridge  In 2008-2009 the 1881 bridge was demolished to build a three span steel and concrete railway bridge. The new bridge was designed by HBPW Structural and Civil Engineering Services and built by Carillion Civil Engineering and Railtrack. The bridge's piers were designed to align with the middle three piers of the existing 1906 Tees Bridge to allow for the easy passage of river traffic. The 2009 bridge scheme received a commendation in the Institution of Civil Engineers' Robert Stephenson Awards 2010.

The couple received international attention following a speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention that criticized Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Biography Khizr Khan was born in 1950, the eldest of ten children, to poultry farming parents in Gujranwala, a city in Pakistan's Punjab Province. Ghazala is also from Punjab, born in 1951 in Faisalabad. The couple met while attending the University of Punjab, where Ghazala studied Persian and Khizr pursued an LL.B. in the Law College. Khizr passed the Punjab bar in 1974. Once married, the couple moved to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates to earn money to move to the United States. Two of their sons, Shaharyar and Humayun, were born in Dubai. Immigration to the United States They moved from the UAE to the United States in 1980. Their first home in the US was in Houston, Texas, where the family stayed while Khizr went to receive LL.M. degrees from the University of Missouri Law School in 1982 and Harvard Law School in 1986. In 1986 they also became American citizens. Khizr, Ghazala, and their two sons then moved to Silver Spring, Maryland, where their third son, Omer, was born. Khizr went on to work at the Washington, D.C., office of the law firm of Hogan & Hartson, one of the largest law firms in the United States, where he was employed as the firm's manager of litigation technology from 2000 to 2007. Death of Humayun Khan Their middle child, Humayun, attended the University of Virginia, where he became a cadet in its Army ROTC program. Upon graduating in 2000, he was commissioned in the Army as a way to earn money for law school and because, according to Khizr, Humayun \\"felt that ROTC had completed him as a person, and he wanted to give back.\\" He rose to the rank of captain and served in Iraq during the Iraq War. In 2004, at the age of 27, Humayun was killed in Baqubah, Iraq, in an explosion. He was inspecting a guard post when he saw a suspicious vehicle approaching. Ordering his subordinates to stay back, he stepped forward to engage. The car was later determined to have been carrying more than 200 pounds of explosives, and when it detonated he was killed along with the two suicide attackers. (reposted July 28, 2016 as \\"Khizr Khan's loss: A grieving father of a soldier struggles to understand\\" (archived July 31, 2016)) He was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star Medal and Purple Heart and is interred at Arlington National Cemetery. Move to Virginia Following Humayun's death, the Khans moved to Charlottesville, Virginia, to be closer to their other sons. Ghazala began working at a fabric store and Khizr continued his legal consulting, working in commercial law and specializing in electronic discovery. They became heavily involved with the University of Virginia ROTC program, where Humayun had been a cadet, and became known as the \\"mom and pop of the department\\". In 2008, the Khans participated in an HBO documentary, Section 60: Arlington National Cemetery, featuring visitors to the section of Arlington National Cemetery where their son, and many other United States military personnel who died in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, are buried. Politics Before 2015, the Khans had not been publicly political. In the 1980s, Khizr was a strong supporter of Ronald Reagan, but in 2015 he had a strong negative reaction to then-candidate Donald Trump's speech promoting the idea of banning Muslims from entering the country. He gave an interview on the subject to a reporter for Vocativ, published in December 2015. Many of Khizr's speeches and writings focus on United States founding documents, and in particular the Constitution. He was introduced to them as a law student in Pakistan, and found them both profound and thought-provoking. Starting in 2005, Khizr began carrying pocket constitutions with him, which he would read from and give to University of Virginia ROTC cadets. 2016 DNC speech Khizr Khan speaks at the 2016 Democratic National Convention Prior to the 2016 Democratic National Convention, Hillary Clinton's campaign reached out to the Khans about speaking at the event. The couple deliberated and eventually agreed, believing it to be what Humayun would have done, despite protests from their other sons that it would make them targets for criticism. In planning for the speech, Ghazala opted not to speak on stage, worried that she would not be able to maintain her composure if a picture of her son were with them. On July 28, the final day of the convention, Khizr, accompanied by Ghazala, gave a speech about Humayun, during which he harshly criticized Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump. Khan took issue with several of Trump's policies, including his proposed ban on migration from a list of majority- Muslim countries. Many news outlets focused on two passages from the speech in particular: When Khizr offered to lend Trump his copy of the Constitution, he pulled a small version of the document from his pocket, holding it up and gesturing with it, in what the Washington Post called it the most memorable image from the convention. Khan said afterwards that the gesture was unplanned, and that he ad-libbed the sentence about lending Trump his copy upon realizing he had it in his pocket. According to the New York Times, Khan has long kept a supply of pocket Constitutions in his home, carrying one around and distributing copies to visitors \\"the way other hosts might distribute a party favor.\\" Following the speech, sales of pocket Constitutions soared, with one 2005 edition rising to the second position on Amazon.com's bestsellers list. The ACLU offered free copies through their website until Election Day (November 8, 2016), but public demand (reportedly over 100,000) exhausted their supply within days. Updated August 5, 2016 The ACLU also offered an \\"I'll gladly lend you mine\\" graphic tee shirt. A year later, The Guardian Simon Hattenstone called it \\"a defining image\\" of the election, which \\"remains the most eloquent response to Trump's bigotry.\\" New York magazine's Andrew Sullivan declared the speech \\"the fulcrum of this election,\\" and one minute after it had ended, a spike in searches for \\"register to vote\\" was seen on Google. =Trump's response= In an interview with ABC News, George Stephanopoulos asked Trump about the content of the speech, asking him to respond to the charge that he had not made sacrifices. Trump began by suggesting that Hillary Clinton's campaign staff had written the speech (according to Khizr, they wrote it themselves), and said, \\"I think I've made a lot of sacrifices ... I've created thousands and thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, built great structures. I've had tremendous success. I think I've done a lot.\\" He went on to describe financial help he has provided for veterans' causes. Trump also remarked on Ghazala's presence on stage, implying a connection between her silence and gender roles in Islam: \\"If you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had nothing to say. She probably ‚Äî maybe she wasn't allowed to have anything to say. You tell me.\\" Directly responding to Trump's comments, Ghazala wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post, saying that Trump is ignorant with regard to Islam and its relationship to terrorism, and explaining that while she was asked if she wanted to speak, she felt she would be too upset to do so. In an interview on Morning Joe the day after the op-ed was published, she added that \\"All Muslim women have very strong opinions if they have to talk to their husbands they can say anything they like to. We are not from that type of culture that we will just have to follow the husband. Islam teaches us to be equal, but we have different responsibility. At home wife is in charge, outside men, whatever, he his making, whatever, he is bringing home and we both got together as husband and wife to raise the family.\\" =Political and public reaction= Trump's comments sparked widespread outrage and condemnation from both Democrats and Republicans, and were widely reported in the press. Prominently, Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona, who Khizr says was a hero to Humayun, issued a statement about what he called his \\"most severe disagreement\\" with Trump, saying \\"While our party has bestowed upon him the nomination, it is not accompanied by unfettered license to defame those who are the best among us.\\" In a Washington Post op-ed, Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine cited Trump's treatment of the Khans as one of the major reasons why she \\"will not be voting for Donald Trump for president.\\" Muslim American women took to social media with the hashtag \\"#CanYouHearUsNow\\" to protest Trump's comments. The organization Veterans of Foreign Wars issued a statement saying, \\"Election year or not, the VFW will not tolerate anyone berating a Gold Star family member for exercising his or her right of speech or expression.\\" Paul Rieckhoff of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America said that Trump's comparison of his own sacrifice to families who lost family members in war was \\"insulting, foolish and ignorant.\\" The Jewish War Veterans of the United States said that Trump was worthy of \\"contempt\\" and said that his remarks on Ghazala Khan were \\"vile beyond words.\\" An open letter by 23 Gold Star families called upon Trump to apologize to the Khans. On August 4, a group of protesters at a Trump rally in Portland, Maine, were ejected after standing among the seated attendees and silently holding up pocket Constitutions. On August 5, Khizr told Anderson Cooper that he and his wife were withdrawing from further TV appearances because it was emotionally draining, but said they would not be silent. On September 3, the Khans were special guests at the Islamic Society of North America convention in Rosemont, Illinois, where they both spoke. They did not address the election, other than Ghazala joking, \\"I have to speak today.\\" Khizr made one other high-profile appearance before the election on October 21, 2016, when the Hillary Clinton campaign released a 60-second television ad featuring Khizr Khan at home, showing the viewer pictures and mementos while telling the story of Humayun's sacrifice, and his voice wells up as he concludes, \\"I want to ask Mr. Trump: Would my son have a place in your America?\\" In the final weeks of the election, Khizr joined Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail in Virginia. Post-election activities Muslim Ban Ever\\" rally outside the Supreme Court, April 2018 After Trump's victory in the presidential election, in response to his announced nominations for cabinet positions before the inauguration, Khizr Khan urged the Senate Judiciary Committee to reject Senator Jeff Sessions as Attorney General, pointing out the Senate's rejection of Sessions in 1986 for a federal judgeship over racism concerns, and adding that Sessions \\"does not understand patriotic dissent.\\" Khizr also voiced opposition against Trump's travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries, threatening an anti-Trump boycott if the ban was not repealed. On March 5, 2017, Khan canceled a planned speaking engagement in Toronto and said he had been told that his travel privileges were being reviewed. His Facebook announcement said, \\"This turn of events is not just of deep concern to me but to all my fellow Americans who cherish our freedom to travel abroad. I have not been given any reason as to why.\\" Camielle Edwards, spokeswoman for Canada's Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen, said, \\"We are unaware of any restrictions regarding this traveler.\\" Khan later said that he \\"did not want to go through the hassle of uncertain rules and capricious implementation\\" at the border. On August 18, 2020, Khan appeared on video as a delegate at the Democratic National Convention to cast the votes of Virginia for Joe Biden. Memoir Khizr published a memoir in October 2017 entitled An American Family: A Memoir of Hope and Sacrifice, published by Random House. Simon Hattenstone wrote in The Guardian that while \\"it tells the story of the Khan family ... it is also a universal story of migration - struggle, hope and achievement\\". In the New York Times Book Review, Linda Chavez said it \\"can teach all of us what real American patriotism looks like\\" and called it \\"a wonderful refutation of Trump's nativism and bigotry\\" without becoming a \\"partisan polemic\\". Alyssa Rosenberg wrote in The Washington Post that the memoir is \\"a small but lovely immigrant's journey\\" which successfully avoids \\"Trump outbursts\\". She went on to say that \\"Khizr Khan is probably a better American than I am. But it's a strength of his book that I felt inspired, rather than condemned, by that conclusion.\\" See also *Gold Star Fathers Act of 2014 *American Gold Star Mothers *Gold Star Mothers National Monument References  External links  * Khizr Khan, Father of Veteran (C-SPAN, July 28, 2016) ‚Äì Full DNC speech with pre-recorded introduction by Hillary Clinton.

Taking place 22‚Äì27 January in Panama City, Panama, it was the first of its kind celebrated in Central America. Pope Francis announced plans for the event at the end of the closing Mass of World Youth Day 2016 in Brzegi near Krak√≥w, Poland, on 31 July 2016. Theme On 22 November 2016, Pope Francis announced the theme for World Youth Day 2019: I am the servant of the Lord. May it be done to me according to your word (Lk 1:38). The theme coincided with the goals of the XV Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops on youth, faith and vocational discernment, held in 2018. Logo and Hymn On 14 May 2017, the WYD 2019 logo was revealed during a Eucharistic meeting. The design was chosen from 103 proposals submitted to the Archdiocese of Panama in a contest that was won by Ambar Calvo, an architecture student. The Panama Canal appears as a symbol of the journey that pilgrims travel to Jesus guided by Mary. The pilgrim's cross also appears. The points mean two things: they are the crown of the Virgin, but also the pilgrims who are on their way to travel the continents. Like the logo, the creation and edition of the official anthem was submitted to a contest, where several proposals were presented to the Archdiocese of Panama, which was conquered by Abdiel Gonz√°lez. On 3 July, during the XLVII Bread and Wine Dinner held at the ATLAPA Convention Center, it was presented to around 3,000 people, in the presence of Panamanian bishops and President Juan Carlos Varela. The Archbishop of Panama, Jos√© Domingo Ulloa Mendieta, said that \\"this hymn expresses the mission to which we are called adisciples and missionaries in these times, following the example of the Virgin Mary\\". The hymn of the event was named Be It Done to Me, according to Your Word, and was launched by Archbishop Mendieta of Panama on 3 July 2017, in the Panamanian capital. Announcement Pope Francis announced plans for the upcoming event at World Youth Day in Krak√≥w on 31 July 2016. The president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, accompanied the announcement. Francis also said that he did not know if he would be on this journey as St. Peter's successor: \\"I do not know if I will be in Panama, but Peter will be.\\" Journey The main event center of this journey was Campo Santa Maria La Antigua. Panama City, provided for the pilgrims, in connection with the events of WYD, and the Park of Forgiveness Renew me, located in the Recreation Park Omar Torrijos, a space for the young people to have access to the vocational fair Follow Me. Between 22 January and 25 January, the afternoon periods in particular were marked by concerts and presentations by various Catholic bands, called the \\"Youth Festival\\", which had 33 venues, 7 official venues, 5 satellite venues, as well as other venue points of dance and theater presentations, plastic arts exhibitions, paintings and photography, and a foods space. Among the more than 20 artists confirmed, headliners included Canadian Matt Maher, Australian priest Rob Galea, winners of the 2018 Grammy Alfareros, rock nuns Siervas, and the Brazilian band Mission√°rio Shalom. There was also the theme park called \\"Cristonautas\\". The theme of migrants was often mentioned by the Pope during this journey, which was attended by many young Venezuelans at a time when the country was going through a serious political and social crisis. First day (22 January) =Opening= Participants gathering for the welcome ceremony along the Cinta Costera The events began this day, in the Park of Forgiveness, the vocational fair, and in Cristonautas Park. The Opening Ceremony of the Day was held in the Campo Santa Maria La Antigua. In his homily, Archbishop Mendieta of Panama welcomed the pilgrims, saying: \\"Our joy is immense in the presence of all of you. Today we welcome you with open hearts and arms. Thank you for accepting the call to meet us in this small country where faith came hand in hand with the Virgin Mary under the title of Santa Maria La Antigua. A country that made every effort to have each of you have an encounter with Jesus Christ: the Way, Truth and Life.\\" The archbishop recalled that Panama was the first diocese on the mainland of the Americas, where the Gospel was spread to the rest of the American continent, and spoke of gratitude to God for hosting this WYD: \\"Our people are ready to receive you, to share their traditions, multiethnic and pluricultural wealth, but in a very special way, share the joy of faith in a God who is acting among us in our personal and community history.\\" Second Day (23 January) =Catechesis= The first day of pilgrims' catecheses with the bishops took place. =Pope's arrival to Panama= Participants awaiting the arrival of Pope Francis at the Tocumen International Airport Pope Francis departed from Rome on 23 January, landing at Panama City Airport at 4:30 pm local time after a trip that included traveling 9,500 km over 10 countries during 13 hours' flying time.g1.globo.com/mundo/ The Supreme Pontiff was received by the Panamanian President Varela, local bishops and about two thousand young people, who sang the well-known phrase in Spanish \\"This is the Pope's youth\\". No speeches or pronouncements were made, only the hymns of the Vatican and Panama. Pope Francis then traveled to the headquarters of the Apostolic Nunciature, where he stayed throughout the event. Thousands of people gathered along the avenues of the country's capital to greet the Holy Father. =Pardon Park= There was also a procession of the pilgrim image of Our Lady of Fatima, who had arrived from Portugal the day before, and shortly after the Holy Mass, presided over by the Archbishop Mendieta, there was the inauguration of the Park of Forgiveness, in which 200 confessionals were installed so that the young pilgrims could receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation. \\"Here thousands of young people will come to hear from the Lord of love, of forgiveness, that a new life begins,\\" said the archbishop, who also assured that \\"the great majority of young people will not leave World Day without going through these confessionals.\\" The 200 confessionals were manufactured by 35 inmates of the La Joya penitentiary complex. After the inauguration, Dom Mendieta was the first to confess, saying that he is \\"a sinner redeemed by the mercy of God. To truly confess it helps me a lot, especially in this time that I will have to help in the reconciliation of many on Friday that I will be with the Holy Father confessing the young people of the detention center.\\"panama2019.pa/pt/ Third day (24 January) This day began with a welcome to Pope Francis in Palacio de las Garzas, received by the Panamanian president, to whom he gave an image of Santa Maria La Antigua in his first official event. In addition to the president, Francisco was received by the first lady Lorena Castillo, the cardinal Jos√© Luis Lacunza Maestroju√°n and the archbishop of Panama, Jos√© Luis Ulloa Mendieta. Later he met with members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and with Central American bishops. =Catecheses= At the same time as the meeting of the authorities, the pilgrims of the journey met in their respective catecheses for the second day, whose theme was \\"Behold the handmaid of the Lord.\\" =Opening ceremony= The official opening ceremony of WYD began this day. In his address to thousands of young people in Campo Santa Maria la Antigua, the Pope said to the young people: Fourth Day (25 January) =Catecheses= Catecheses took place for the last day, whose theme was \\"Let it be done to me according to your will.\\" =Las Garzas= The Pontiff was with 180 young people held in the Center of Compliance of Minors, in Las Garzas. The Pope was welcomed by Archbishop Mendieta and the national director of the Institute of Interdisciplinary Studies, Emma Alba Tejeda. The young people presented to the Holy Father the song \\"The prayer of the poor\\". Francis also heard a testimony of the intern Luis Oscar Mart√≠nez.[ http://conventodapenha.org.br/jmj2019-papa-aos-menores-infratores-deus-nao-ve- rotulos-mas-filhos/ conventodapenha.org.br] The Pope presided over the moment with the young inmates. He emphasized the Gospel of Luke (Luke 15: 2) in the homily when the Pharisees and scribes attempted to condemn Christ for sitting at the table with those who were considered sinners. After the Penitential Liturgy, some of the young people deprived of their liberty were able to confess to the Holy Father and to some bishops. The Pope also greeted another 30 detainees who participated in the manufacture of the 250 confessionals used in WYD Panama. Pope Francis gave to the inmates an iron sculpture of Christ on the Cross outlined by olive branches. =Via Sacra= In the evening, about 400,000 people participated in the Via Sacra, which was presided over by the Pope and held in Campo Santa Maria la Antigua. The theme chosen for this moment was \\"reality of the young and the Martyr Church\\". Young people of Latin America prayed the 14 stations that portray the journey of Christ to Calvary, remembering the sufferings present today throughout the world. The young people of Brazil, for example, performed for the eighth station the passage of the Gospel of Mark 15:21 on Simon of Cyrene, embellished with the message \\"May the cross of others be our cross. Let us be united and take with love the immense cross of the world\\", and that young people who feel defeated should not lose hope. In his reflection, the Pontiff said: The conclusion of the beautiful speech of the Pope was: \\"We want to be a Church that supports and accompanies, who knows how to say 'I am here', in the lives and crosses of so many Christians who walk beside us.\\" Fifth day (January 26) =Basilica= Pope Francis presided at the morning the Mass consecrating the altar of the Cathedral Basilica of Santa Maria la Antigua. The priests, consecrated men, and lay movements of Panama participated in the Mass. During the celebration, the Pope performed the rite of dedication of the altar of the cathedral, where relics of three Latin American saints were placed: Rose of Lima, √ìscar Romero, Martin of Porres, and a Polish saint, John Paul II. With this liturgical act, this became the first cathedral of America whose altar was consecrated by a pontiff. =Lunch= In the afternoon the Holy Father had a private lunch in the Major Seminary of St. Joseph with a group of 10 young people who participated in WYD, 5 boys and 5 girls, of different nationalities representing the 5 continents. =Vigil= After that, at night time, ending the day, the Pope presided over the vigil with about 600,000 young people in Campo S√£o Jo√£o Paulo II. The pilgrim image of Our Lady of Fatima was present throughout the event. The crowd was invited to listen to three testimonies: the first was that of Erika de Bucktron, mother of four children, and the youngest has Down syndrome, and it was recommended to her to perform an abortion of the latter. The second testimony was Alfredo Mart√≠nez Andri√≥n, 20, who was a choirboy in his childhood, but the poverty of his family forced him to leave school to work. He fell into drugs and was arrested, but found help at the St. John Paul II Foundation. Finally came the testimony of 26-year-old Nirmeen Odeh of Palestine, who recognized that although she was baptized because of where she lived, she thought it better to be away from Christianity. However, at World Youth Day 2016, she discovered the love of Jesus. Later, through books like The Confessions of St. Augustine, she strengthened his faith. After the testimonies, Francis gave a speech, assuring the youth: \\"Mary shows the power of God. With a few words, she knew how to say yes, trusting in the love and promises of God, the only force capable of making all things new.\\" Sixth day (27 January) =Closing Mass= Pope Francis began his day with the closing Mass of WYD. At the beginning of the celebration, the Pope was addressed by Archbishop Jos√© Domingo Ulloa Mendieta, who thanked the opportunity given to the country to organize this edition of WYD: The Pontiff invited the young people to take up their \\"missionary call now, and not in the future, following the example of Mary who said, 'Let it be done to me according to your word.' \\" About 720,000 pilgrims were present at the Campo S√£o Jo√£o Paulo II ‚Äì Metro Park. The passage from the Gospel that initiates the public life of Jesus was reflected in the homily reference to the synagogue where Isaiah's prophecy had been fulfilled: \\"Jesus reveals the now of God, who comes to meet us, to call us also to take part in his now 'to proclaim the Good News'.\\" At the end of the Mass, the Pope prayed to Our Lady, entrusting to her the young people of the whole world, and said goodbye to the pilgrims, announcing the site of the next WYD in 2022, in Lisbon, Portugal: Present at this Mass were the presidents of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela; of Costa Rica, Carlos Alvarado; of Colombia, Iv√°n Duque; of Guatemala, Jimmy Morales; of El Salvador, Salvador S√°nchez Cer√©n; and Honduras, Juan Orlando Hern√°ndez. =House of the Good Samaritan= After Mass, the Pope went to the Good Samaritan House, presenting the place with an image of the Good Shepherd. =Meeting with volunteers and farewell= In his last appearance in Panama, before the 19,500 volunteers of the Journey, the Pope made a speech with which he concluded his visit. Three of these young people made a brief address to the Pope, expressing their experiences of volunteering and participating in WYD. Archbishop Mendieta spoke briefly, thanking the Pope for his example and assuring the Pontiff of their prayers: \\"Count on the prayer of this youth.\\" The Pope took leave of the authorities and departed for Rome.

It uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and provides features such as authentication, bidirectional streaming and flow control, blocking or nonblocking bindings, and cancellation and timeouts. It generates cross-platform client and server bindings for many languages. Most common usage scenarios include connecting services in microservices style architecture and connect mobile devices, browser clients to backend services.https://grpc.io/about/ gRPC's complex use of HTTP/2 makes it impossible to implement a gRPC client in the browser, instead requiring a proxy.  Authentication  gRPC supports the usage of TLS and token based authentication. Connection to Google services must use TLS. There are two types of credentials: channel credentials and call credentials.  Encoding  gRPC uses protocol buffers to encode the data. Contrary to HTTP APIs with JSON, they have a more strict specification. Due to having a single specification, gRPC eliminates debate and saves developer time because gRPC is consistent across platforms and implementations.  Adoption  A number of different organizations have adopted gRPC, such as Square, Netflix, CoreOS, Docker, CockroachDB, Cisco, Juniper Networks and Spotify. The open source project u-bmc uses gRPC to replace IPMI. On 8 January 2019, Dropbox announced that the next version of \\"Courier\\", their RPC framework at the core of their SOA architecture, would be migrated to be based on gRPC, primarily because it aligned well with their existing custom RPC frameworks.

Animal ethics  Deckers has published numerous articles in animal ethics, mainly on the ethical issues associated with the human consumption of animal products.https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=hXCTsB8AAAAJ&hl;=en&oi;=sra This topic has been approached from various angles, including its connections with the causation of harm to animals, environmental degradation, climate change, and the emergence and spread of zoonoses. Early work also considered the relevance of the philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead for animal ethics, where Deckers's work has been reviewed critically by other Whiteheadian scholars.McDaniel J. A response to Deckers. Journal of Animal Ethics 2011, 1(1) 93‚Äì95; Dombrowski D. A response to Deckers. Journal of Animal Ethics 2011, 1(2), 210‚Äì14. More recent work has also considered the ethics of in- vitro flesh and the idea of creating animals with decreased pain sensitivity, where Deckers chaired a conference on these themes, funded by the Wellcome Trust.The audio-visual recordings and powerpoint slides of this conference can be found here: As a speciesist, Deckers argues that human health is paramount to address whether and when animal products ought to be consumed. The book Animal (De)liberation: Should the Consumption of Animal Products Be Banned? defends 'qualified moral veganism', which is associated with a political goal: the vegan project.Deckers J. Animal (De)liberation: Should the Consumption of Animal Products Be Banned?, London: Ubiquity Press, 2016; [doi: https://dx.doi.org/10.5334/bay]. The book is critical of positions adopted by other scholars, including Alasdair Cochrane, Gary Francione, Martha Nussbaum, and Peter Singer, and has more in common with the positions of scholars such as Alice Crary, Melanie Joy, and Marti Kheel. Many charges have been pressed against vegan diets, for example that they alienate human beings from nature (Michael Pollan) or that they increase human food security and other sustainability concerns relative to other diets (Simon Fairlie).Fairlie S. Meat: A Benign Extravagance, East Meon: Permanent Publications, 2010. Deckers addresses these challenges. The book‚Äôs appendix also considers whether vegan diets might be nutritionally adequate or even superior compared to other diets. The book has been described as ‚Äòan innovative defense of veganism‚Äô because of its concern with maximising positive global health impacts, and its primary focus on safeguarding the health of moral agents.Mancilla, A. Veganism. In: P. Thompson and D. Kaplan (eds.). Encyclopedia of Food and Agricultural Ethics. Dordrecht: Springer; 2016:4. https://doi.org/ 10.1007/978‚Äê94‚Äê007‚Äê6167‚Äê4_578‚Äê1  Reproductive ethics and embryo research  Deckers has analysed debate in Westminster Parliament around the use of embryos for stem cell research and cloning as well as the law on abortion in Great Britain, and argued for legal reform.Deckers, J. An Analysis of the Arguments Underpinning UK Embryonic Stem Cell Legislation on the Embryo's Status. Journal of Stem Cells 2007, 2(1), 47‚Äì62. http://www.novapublishers.org/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=5525 (author‚Äôs version at https://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/pub_details2.aspx?pub_id=31766); Reprinted also here: http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr;=&id;=uFliNQuyeokC&oi;=fnd&pg;=PA59&ots;=5c_8cjvmFb&sig;=idKTcUYtOrdQZ3tdK- GBOwqem-o#v=onepage&q;&f;=false In the debate on abortion, Deckers has engaged with Judith Jarvis Thomson's thought experiment of the violinist. In an article with the title 'The right to life and abortion legislation in England and Wales: A proposal for change‚Äô, Deckers argues for a radical overhaul of the law on abortion in England and Wales.Deckers J. The right to life and abortion legislation in England and Wales: A proposal for change. Diametros 2010, 26, 1‚Äì22. URL:. His work in this area has been the subject of significant academic critique.See e.g. Eberl, J. T. (2007). A Thomistic perspective on the beginning of personhood: redux. Bioethics, 21(5), 283‚Äì289.  Genetics  In his article ‚ÄòAre scientists right and non-scientists wrong? Reflections on discussions of GM‚Äô Deckers analyses the views of scientists and non-scientists on genetic engineering.Deckers J. Are scientists right and non- scientists wrong? Reflections on discussions of GM. Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics 2005, 18(5), 451‚Äì478. doi: 10.1007/s10806-005-0902-1(author's version at .) In a comprehensive overview of the literature between 1975 and 2008, the article was identified as a key paper in the debate on the ethics of GM crops.Gregorowius, D., Lindemann- Matthies, P., & Huppenbauer, M. (2012). Ethical discourse on the use of genetically modified crops: a review of academic publications in the fields of ecology and environmental ethics. Journal of agricultural and environmental ethics, 25(3), 265‚Äì293. More recent work reflects on the meaning and the moral significance or otherwise of the (un)natural, where Deckers argues, inspired by Alfred North Whitehead‚Äôs teleological understanding of natural entities, that the concept of the unnatural carries both meaning and moral significance in discussions of genetic engineering. At the same time, his (ontological) understanding of the world is critical of Whitehead's thought by rejecting the view that the universe as a whole is a teleological entity.Deckers J. Animal (De)liberation: Should the Consumption of Animal Products Be Banned?, London: Ubiquity Press, 2016, sections 2.6 and 2.11.[doi: https://dx.doi.org/10.5334/bay]. Deckers also developed a contextualised case in human genetics as a teaching resource for Advance Higher Education.  Other work  In a book chapter on 'Fairness in Newcastle: Theory and Practice‚Äô, Deckers engages with a report of the Newcastle Fairness Commission, published in 2012, which set out to define some principles of fairness to improve decision-making and guide the work of Newcastle City Council and other organisations in the city.Deckers J.

In April 2010, a complaint about her was made to the General Medical Council by the National Policing Improvement Agency, since then disbanded.https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/squier-v- gmc-protected-approved-judgment-20160311-2.pdf Following various disciplinary and legal processes, she appeared before the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service between October 2015 and March 2016. The charges against her related to six babies about whom she had provided reports and given evidence. It was alleged that she expressed opinions outside her field of expertise, made assertions that were not supported by evidence, and misrepresented research papers to support her opinions. At the conclusion of the hearing, the tribunal determined that Squier was guilty of repeated dishonesty, her fitness to practice was impaired, and that she should be struck off the medical register.http://www.mpts- uk.org/static/documents/content/Waney_Marian_Valerie_SQUIER_21_March_2016.pdf Squier appealed the tribunal's decision to the High Court of England and Wales during October 2016. On 3 November 2016, the court published a judgment which concluded that \\"the determination of the MPT is in many significant respects flawed\\". The judge found that she had committed serious professional misconduct but was not dishonest. She was reinstated to the medical register but is not allowed to give expert evidence in court for three years. At one time, Dr Squier believed in the theory of shaken baby syndrome and appeared as a witness for the prosecution in a number of cases. However on examining the available evidence for the theory more closely, she has come to believe that there is no evidence for shaken baby syndrome and that it does not exist.

According to Harpercollins, Vallotton is the bestselling artist of all time, thanks to worldwide sales of the Good News Bible in excess of 225 million. Early life Vallotton was born in Lausanne, Switzerland, the daughter of Swiss writer, teacher and journalist Benjamin Vallotton who had studied theology in Munich and Paris; her mother had been born in Alsace, the granddaughter of a Lutheran pastor. Her father's cousin was the painter, F√©lix Vallotton. During World War II, she and her sister Gritou worked for the Resistance; she used her Swiss nationality to help her transport mail. Vallotton also worked in a refugee centre in Toulouse where she painted frescos on the walls in attempt to make them more welcoming to families from Poland, Estonia and other Baltic states. While at the centre, Vallotton befriended Resistance fighter Berty Albrecht who had been baptized by Vallotton's grandfather. Career as an Illustrator A lifelong Christian, Vallotton set out to simplify the Gospel message with the use of illustration. Aside from the Good News Bible, her works include From the Apple to the Moon, (1970), Who Are You Jesus (1973), The Man who said No: Story of Jonah (1977) and The Mighty One and Sam, (1982). Prior to her success with the Good News Bible, her only work had been one called Priority, a collection of 60 illustrations covering the life of Jesus and considered so unmarketable by her agent that he dumped 3,000 copies in the Seine. At Eurofest '75, the Billy Graham organised conference in Belgium, Vallotton gave an illustrated talk on an overhead projector, fitted with an acetate scroll, each morning before the Bible exposition. Good News For Modern Man In the early 1960s, impressed by the illustrations he had seen in Priority, New York publisher Eugene Nida contacted Vallotton about illustrating a children's Bible. After a ten-minute meeting with Nida at Stuttgart Airport, Vallotton agreed to begin work on the Good News Bible. Vallotton created over 500 illustrations and drew some of them up to 90 times to get them right. Vallotton's distinctive style uses simple lines and shading to convey character and emotion: ‚ÄúI wanted to simplify them the most I could. I wanted to get to the truth... the most important thing!‚Äù Later life Vallotton continued to illustrate religious books after her success with the Good News Bible. She also designed six stained-glass windows depicting the Creation at the Reformed Church of Saint- Di√©-des-Vosges in Lorraine, northeastern France where her brother Paul Vallotton was the minister. In later life she had a storytelling ministry to children at a Protestant church in Paris.

Accessed June 23, 2016. Urban Canyon (2015) This exhibition was held in the 1335 Mabini art gallery in Manila, and was structured to draw the audience's attention to the unique structures hidden in the city. The artist's idea behind this project is that our conception of a city relies heavily on cosmopolitan ideals, which inevitably eliminate its true character. For this show, Anading exhibited four series of projects: Road to Mountains, Untitled (Drawer), Homage to Homage, and Gateway. In the show, the artist used ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù objects from the city that were annihilated in order to make way for the new urban setting, and placed them outside of their usual environment. Understanding the exhibition requires questioning what is lost within the structure and what it is replaced with.Lumbao, Cocoy. \\"Urban Canyon.\\" 1335mabini. March 2015. Accessed June 23, 2016. In Untitled (Drawer), the artist accumulated images of tower cranes in clear film photographs, as the tower crane disappeared when the skyscraper reached its final stage. As the new object was completed the tower cranes vanished in oblivion.Lumbao, Cocoy. \\"Urban Canyon.\\" 1335mabini. March 2015. Accessed July 06, 2016. A similar topic was portrayed in Homage to Homage, in which a scaffold was wrapped in steel by the artist in order to celebrate its temporary nature. The idea behind the show was to demonstrate the vanishing nature of all objects that are created for the sole purpose of aiding architecture that will construct the ideal metropolitan city. The scaffold's form was preserved but wrapped in luster by the artist in order to depict the very question behind its presence, and ultimately its disappearance. In Road to Mountains, Anading placed rubber tires used as speed bumps throughout the gallery to highlight their contradictory nature; an object used for motion that becomes a means to cease motion. The artist depicted the paradox behind speed bumps alongside the paradox with the progression of city life. The final show in the project; Gateway, was a three-part video set in three different cities: Singapore, Manila and La Rochelle. The artist used this video to explore the ‚Äúborders that define a city‚Äù through the use of contradicting images such as structure and sky, and silhouette and light.\\"Poklong Anading.\\" Guggenheim Collection Online. Accessed June 22, 2016. Anading drew attention through the video to how the urban edifices change cityscapes. Pocket Coffin (2013) This exhibition was held at the Galerie Zimmermann Kratochwill (Graz, Austria) from October 31, 2012 to January 5, 2013. Anading came up with the title of the exhibition during an inter-religious event in the same city, and derived the name from a 7th-century pocketbook.Lumbao, Cocoy. \\"Miracle Healing and Other Hopeful Things.\\" 1335mabini. 2015.

One of the shows in the exhibition was called ‚Äúrfinderexplore‚Äù, which consisted of sound files made up of the various voices heard during the religious conference. The artist presented all of these sound files as blank folders, eliminating the certainty that the digital usually brings and instead forcing the viewer to delve into uncertainty. Miracle Healing and Other Hopeful Things (2011) Miracle Healing and Other Hopeful Things (2011, Mo Space, Manila) was the artist's exhibition of large scale installations.

He made major contributions in the areas of philosophy of religion, and philosophy of science. He taught and conducted research as a professor of philosophy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, from 1967 to 1999, and as a visiting professor at several other universities. His teaching and research interests included philosophy of time, philosophy of logic, and theism. He authored 10 books and more than 300 articles, earned many awards, and gave many presentations as a sought after speaker.... His presentations at a summer conference resulted in the Philosophy of Time Society. This society is still active to this date. Schlesinger was also an ordained rabbi, and authored many articles in the area of philosophy of Judaism. He led services, and taught at the University of North Carolina Hillel, as well as yeshivas and synagogues in England, Australia, and Israel. As an author, he has been largely collected by libraries worldwide.  Early life and yeshiva education  George Schlesinger, whose Hebrew name is Harav Nattan ben Harav Shmuel, was born in Budapest, Hungary on November 7, 1925. In the late 1930s, before World War II, the Nazis were approaching Hungary. At the age of 13 or 14, in 1939, Schlesinger, his brother, and parents were able to obtain a visa and escape to Palestine. They settled in Bnei Brak, living next door to Rav Karelitz, who later became famous and known as the Hazon Ish. Schlesinger later studied at the Yeshiva Kol Torah and the Chevron Yeshiva. At 23, Schlesinger worked as a Rosh Mesivta (teacher) at Yeshivat Bnei Akiva in Kfar ha-Roeh. He was soon thereafter ordained as a Rabbi in 1948. In 1950 at Kfar ha-Roeh, he met his wife, Shulamith.  Secular studies  Unlike many of the other Yeshiva students, Schlesinger had a desire to study English and secular studies in addition to his Torah learning. Shortly after getting married, Schlesinger and his wife, Shulamith, moved to England. He taught at a Jewish institution in Manchester, England. He went on to receive his B.Sc. and M.Sc in Physics at the University of London. Schlesinger and his wife then moved to Australia. He received his PhD in Philosophy from the University of Melbourne in 1959.  Career  In Melbourne, Schlesinger helped run a network of orthodox schools and published a periodical for children and parents. He also was a volunteer rabbi in Canberra, Australia where his son David was born. After receiving his PhD, from 1960 until 1967, he taught at the Australian National University, in Canberra, and reached the rank of Reader, equivalent to a full professor.  Philosophy professor at University of North Carolina  In 1967, Schlesinger moved from Australia to North Carolina, where he began teaching and conducting research as a professor of philosophy at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. He continued to work at the university until his retirement in 1999. During the time he was at the University of North Carolina, he was also a visiting professor many times at the Bar-Ilan University in Israel. He was also a visiting professor at several other universities, including University of Minnesota, the University of Pittsburgh, and the University of Texas. His main areas of teaching and research at Chapel Hill, were philosophy of religion, and philosophy of science. He was particularly interested in confirmation theory, philosophy of physics, and philosophy of time. He taught a course on space and time jointly with physics professor Hendrik van Dam. As a professor, Schlesinger won many awards including, in 1975, the university wide Tanner Award \\"in recognition of excellence in inspiractional teaching\\". In 1990, UNC's Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies presented him with the Henry Horace Williams Award for excellence in undergraduate teaching. While at Chapel Hill, Schlesinger also gave talks at the University Hillel. He and his son David would attend services on Friday night and Saturday, walking in the opposite direction of everyone else going to the football games.  Publications  Schlesinger wrote many books and articles in the areas of philosophy of religion, theism, the problem of evil, philosophy of science, philosophy of time, philosophy of logic, philosophy of physics, metaphysics, philosophy of probability, philosophy of language, and ethics. His books include Aspects of Time, Intelligibility of Nature, Metaphysics:Methods and Problems , New Perspectives on Old-Time Religion, Range of Epistemic Logic, Religion and the Scientific Method, The Sweep of Probability, and Timely Topics. Schlesinger also contributed towards books written by others, including Challenge: Torah Views on Science and Its Problems and Science in the Light of Torah. His articles appear in many well known Philosophical Journals, including The Philosophical Quarterly, Analysis, Mind, Philosophical Studies, Religious Studies, and the International Journal for Philosophy of Religion. His work also appears in Judaic Journals including Chai Today, and Tradition. Philosophy of religion Schlesinger wrote many books and articles in the area of philosophy of religion. He argued very strongly in favor of theism - that there is one and only one infinitely powerful creator of the universe who plays an active role in the world and in our lives. His work focused on examining and analyzing all the arguments in favor and against theism. In his work, many questions are discussed and answered, such as why the world was created in such a way that we have evil and suffering. His work also focused on the logic of belief, including why some would not believe in theism. Schlesinger wrote that there is overwhelming evidence in favor of a creator, such as how fine-tuned the universe is in order to support life. He wrote that although the creator is all powerful, just like it is impossible to name the highest integer, it is not possible to create a world which gives the highest desirable state to its inhabitants. In his article, \\"The First Commandment,\\" he wrote that we are born with a yearning towards a higher power. However, those who are dishonest with others, are also dishonest with themselves, and this self-deception leads many to be non-believers and block out any yearning for a higher power. Schlesinger believed that whether or not to believe in a creator, was a very important decision we would make. Our entire philosophy of life would derive from this fundamental decision. Schlesinger believed we would be betting our life on whatever we decide. Schlesinger defended Pascal's Wager, authoring an article with Dr. William Lycan entitled \\"Pascal's wager defended\\". In this article, Schlesinger and Lycan answered the \\"many Gods\\" challenge to Pascal's wager. In his article, \\"The Problem of Evil and the Problem of Injustice,\\" Schlesinger wrote that the problem of why there is evil and suffering in the world vanishes when one considers the characteristics of the world the creator wished to maximize. These characteristics include the opportunities for man to do good. Schlesinger examined theories as to why there is suffering and then proposed his own theory. He argued that the purpose of suffering can not be punishment as those who do not deserve punishment sometimes suffer. He also argued against reincarnation and suffering based on actions in a previous life, as there is no purpose to the punishment if we cannot remember or be aware of our previous lives, if they exist. He proposed his own theory which is that the world was created in order to increase the opportunities for man to do good, which includes a virtuous response to suffering. Schlesinger wrote books on the topic of philosophy of religion. These include New Perspectives on Old-Time Religion, which contains Schlesinger's ideas and analysis of the logic and philosophy of religious beliefs. In this book, Schlesinger presents a strong defense of theism, which includes answering arguments against theism, such as why there is evil and suffering in the world. Schlesinger also discusses divine attributes in this book, and his belief they are all vs the belief they are separate. In his book, Religion and the Scientific Method, Schlesinger argues that there may be more than one way to acquire knowledge, not only the methods in use by working scientists. In this book, he discusses how those engaged in religious studies can defend the methods that they use even when they are not the same as those in use by scientists. He discusses evidence in favor of theism, and why the existence of evil and suffering in the world is not evidence against theism. In this book, Schlesinger illustrates that reflections on religion lead us to consider almost every other topic in philosophy. Philosophy of time Schlesinger was very focused on time. He pointed out some very interesting ideas about time such as the fact that in a universe without events there is no time. Schlesinger pointed out that events depend on time and time depends on events. Schlesinger wrote many articles analyzing and commenting on the dynamic philosophy of time vs the static philosophy of time. Schlesinger described the dynamic philosophy of time as events that move from the future into the NOW, and then further and further away into the past. In the static view of time, events and moments stay fixed in position. Although most analytic philosophers support the static philosophy of time, Schlesinger argued in numerous articles that we should not be so quick to abandon the dynamic philosophy of time. Schlesinger would often point out the differences between the nature of time and the nature of space. Schlesinger would point out that unlike the dimensions of space, time is dynamic. This is different than the focus of modern physics that time and space are interwoven and one of the same. Schlesinger offered a Philosophy of Time seminar during the summer of 1991. From this seminar, came the Philosophy of Time Society that continues to exist to this date. The society is affiliated with the American Philosophical Association. In his book, Aspects of Time, Schlesinger discusses similarities and differences between the spatial dimensions and time. He also discusses temporal becoming, the direction of time, and backward causation. Philosophy of logic Schlesinger wrote many articles and a book on the logic of knowledge and belief (epistemic logic). He analyzed many interesting questions. In the article \\"The Credibility of Extraordinary Events\\", he discussed how believable it is that a rare event occurred when it is reported by a witness with variable trustworthiness. In the article, \\"Confirmability and Determinism\\", he discussed whether the total amount of confirmation we have (or could have) is sufficient to believe certain things are true, such as whether or not causation and determinism is true throughout the universe. In the article, \\"Do we have to be justified in our beliefs\\", he discussed how people hold on to core beliefs no matter what the evidence says. In his book, \\"Range of Epistemic Logic\\", Schlesinger uses probability theory and epistemic logic to solve problems in philosophical thought. Schlesinger's main theme in this book, is that Epistemic Logic can be profitably applied with a small logical investment. In this book, he applies epistemic logic to \\"Descartes dream argument, issues of privileged access, fallibilism, scepticism, understanding, confirmation, and the confirmation criterion of maningfulness\\". Philosophy of life Schlesinger had a philosophy of life: Attitude and how we react, is what determines our happiness and success in life, rather than the actual events in our life. In many articles Schlesinger offered advice, illustrated with stories. Schlesinger believed that the words we speak are very powerful and we need to be very careful with what we say. In his article, \\"Silence is a Fence for Reason,\\" Schlesinger offers the advice to \\"know what we say\\", but \\"only say what we know\\". In this article, Schlesinger discussed the difference between intelligence and wisdom. If we have a high IQ, but let everyone know, then we do not have wisdom Schlesinger believed that good character was very important. He defined humility as being aware of one's assets, but not believing they are more important than anyone else's assets. Rabbi Schlesinger would often illustrate good character with a story. He described a self-centered person as one who puts on a jacket when it is cold, rather than building a fire  Other  Schlesinger wrote articles and books on many other topics. In the book, \\"Metaphysics, Methods and Problems,\\" he wrote on abstract concepts including existence, objects, space, time, and cause & effect. In the book, \\"Intelligibility of Nature\\", Schlesinger writes on the principle of essential connectivity, present and absent properties, and the elements of the universe. In the book, \\"The Sweep of Probability,\\" Schlesinger applied probability to philosophical problems and life in general. Topics included in the book include confirmation, credibility of witnesses, randomness, and others. In this book, Schlesinger wrote about improbable events, and what would make them extraordinary and warrant our interest. Schlesinger would say that a particular serial number showing up on a bill would be improbable, but it would not be extraordinary. However, if someone was able to guess the entire number correctly, that would be both improbable and extraordinary.  Family life  Schlesinger and his wife, Shulamith, have a son, David, and a daughter-in-law, Linda. There are 4 grandchildren, Avishai, Ariav, Efroni, and Eliana. David and Linda currently live in Memphis. Avishai, Ariav and Efroni - and most recently Eliana - have made aliyah and live in Israel. Efroni authored the book, A Year of Divrei Torah, edited by Linda Schlesinger, and published in 2012. Linda Schlesinger authored the book, Torah Sage in Our Midst, published in 2015 about the well-known Rabbi Efraim Greenblatt who lived in Memphis and later moved to Israel.

The choice of another European city after Santiago de Compostela meant that, so far unique, two consecutive world days were held in the \\"old continent\\". It was celebrated in the Pope's native country. The theme can be summarized in the sentences You have received a spirit of sonship and It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. 1.6 million people gathered on the final Mass. Preparation In the Message for the World Youth Day, announced on August 15, 1990 in the Vatican, John Paul II reminded the role of the Holy Spirit in Christian life. The Pope drew attention to the essence of true freedom and responsibility of Christians towards the world. He invited young people to come to the sanctuary of the Black Madonna at Jasna G√≥ra. The choice of the Polish city of Czestochowa had a strong symbolic value: It is the site of a great sanctuary, to which even Pope John Paul II was very devoted, besides, the city was in Poland, where the Pope was born, so it was an opportunity to pay tribute to all those killed during the war and the Soviet regime. Theme The theme chosen by Pope John Paul II from these days is the eighth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, verse 15: \\"You have received a spirit of children.\\" Hymn The hymn of the World Day chosen for this year is called Abba Ojcze,vatican.va was composed of Slawomir Scychowiak, Mario Tomassi Tamoasso and Sergio Tomassi Tamoasso;es.7digital.com and its anthem%vatican.va was composed by Jan G√≥ra and Jacek Sykulski. Program The event was held as part of the Pope's apostolic visit in Poland and Hungary celebrated 13 to 20, 1991. In particular, the WYD lasted five days, the first three with catechesis, as the vigil at the Mass in the Shrine of Jasna G√≥ra for the pilgrims.
