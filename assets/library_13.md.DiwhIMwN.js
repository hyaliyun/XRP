A 73-year-old ethnic Indian Singaporean man, Aravindan Balakrishnan, and a 67-year-old Tanzanian woman, his wife, Chanda Pattni, had been investigated for slavery and domestic servitude. The case centred around the Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought commune which was led by Balakrishnan. In the early 1980s after a police raid, Balakrishnan decided to move the group's activities underground. Balakrishnan's control over his followers intensified and the commune became a prison to his followers. On 25 October 2013, three women were rescued from the commune. These were: a 69-year-old Malaysian woman (later revealed to be Aishah Wahab), a 57-year-old Irish woman (Josephine Herivel) and a 30-year-old British woman (Katy Morgan- Davies). Katy Morgan-Davies was born into the sect and hadn't experienced the outside world until her release. Perpetrator Aravindan Balakrishnan (known to his followers as \\"Comrade Bala\\") was born in Kerala, India but migrated to Singapore, Malaya, where his father was a soldier, when he was 10. Balakrishnan was a student at Raffles Institution and later the University of Singapore, where although gaining a reputation as a \\"quiet chap\\", he became increasingly politically active and believed that he would have been imprisoned in Singapore had he openly admitted to being a communist. In 1977, while living in London, his Singaporean citizenship – which he gained in 1960 – was revoked due to his leadership of the Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought, which the Ministry of Home Affairs accused of engaging in \\"activities which are prejudicial to the security\\" of Singapore, and denounced him as a radical \\"closely associated with Eurocommunists\\". The authorities claimed that Balakrishnan and others, many of them former Singaporean students he had associated with in London, were plotting to overthrow Singapore's leader, Lee Kuan Yew. Despite believing the United Kingdom to be a fascist state due to its treatment of the people of Singapore during the Malayan Emergency, Balakrishnan emigrated to the UK in 1963 on a British Council scholarship to study at the London School of Economics, and married his wife Chandra in 1971. Over the years he built up a following by giving lectures and staging various sit-ins and protests. He was a regular attendee at London demonstrations, where he waved banners depicting the Chinese leader Mao Zedong and addressed the crowds. In 1974, Balakrishnan and his \\"small clique\\" were expelled from the Communist Party of England (Marxist–Leninist) on account of \\"their pursuance of conspiratorial and splittist activities ... spreading social fascist slanders against the Party and the proletarian movement\\" and attempting \\"to put themselves above the discipline of the Party\\".\\"Statements of the National Executive Committee, CPE (ML)\\", The Marxist-Leninist, 1:1, September 1974, reprinted at marxists.org. Quoted in Nick Cohen \\"Cultists & communists – too close to us for comfort\\", The Spectator (blog), 25 November 2013 The CPE(M–L) \\"repudiated the metaphysical logic harmfully promoted\\" by Balakrishnan in \\"opposition to dialectical materialism and the concrete analysis of concrete conditions\\". In response, Balakrishnan set up the Workers' Institute and launched his own publication, the South London Workers' Bulletin, which accused the CPE(M–L) of being \\"fascists\\" and \\"agents of imperialism\\". Between 1974 and 1976, his followers attempted to \\"build revolutionary stable base areas in working-class communities\\", primarily South London, and worked in ordinary jobs. Balakrishnan discouraged his followers from joining trade unions, describing them as agents of the \\"imperialist fascist bourgeoisie\\". Eventually, after the more liberal members of his group drifted away, a cult of around 10 female members formed around him. The collective moved to Brixton in 1976, under the title Workers Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. Following Mao's death in 1976, the Institute built the Mao Zedong Memorial Centre at 140 Acre Lane, Brixton, which also functioned as a communist collective of \\"thirteen comrades\\", with \\"13 members living on the premises, half in paid work, six doing full-time revolutionary work, with a strong emphasis on women taking a leading role (apart from leading the Party Committee headed by Bala)\\". Members were handed a rota of chores and only allowed to go out in pairs, which Balakrishnan claimed was because the area they lived in was \\"notorious for violence\\" and \\"anything could happen\\". Following a police raid on the Memorial Centre in March 1978, which the group claimed involved \\"over 200 police\\", including officers from the Special Patrol Group, \\"under the pretext of searching for drugs\\", the Workers' Institute effectively went underground, with the remaining members being convinced to end all contact with others and maintain an intense level of secrecy. Family members were later branded fascist agents and ostracised, and Balakrishnan and his captives moved to a number of properties during this time as a means for him to escape detection from the authorities. Balakrishnan convinced his followers that everything was controlled by him from the sun, the moon, wind and fires; that he could overthrow governments, control natural disasters, and make people live or die. In order to progress his cause, Balakrishnan invented \\"JACKIE\\" (an acronym for Jehovah, Allah, Christ, Krishna and Immortal Easwaran) – a type of dangerous, mystical machine that monitored all thought and could control minds. Balakrishnan began sexually abusing two of the women in 1979, often physically beating them and making others watch as he did so. All of the women were beaten and four (not including his wife) were said to have been sexually assaulted or engaged with sexual relations with him. Balakrishnan forced the women to swallow his ejaculate as it was \\"the elixir of life\\", and claimed the women he sexually abused had been trying to seduce him out of \\"jealousy\\" for his lover. Victims *Katy Morgan-Davies - born in 1983, she was originally named Prem Maopinduzi Davies. She began calling herself \\"Rosie\\" in her teens. She has subsequently changed her name to Katy Morgan-Davies, after the American singer Katy Perry. She is the biological daughter of Balakrishnan and Sian Davies. Morgan-Davies was brought up entirely isolated from the outside world and never went to a nursery, school, dentist or doctor. She was not told who her parents were. The commune members taught her to read and write.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-b0af7ef5-1031-4e1f-a3ac-b3c21ef0f932 *Sian Davies - in the early 1980s, after joining the commune, she had a sexual relationship with Balakrishnan. On Christmas Eve 1996, Morgan-Davies remembered seeing Davies bound and gagged on the living room for trying to escape. Later, she fell out of a top floor bathroom window and was taken to hospital. In hospital she suffered a rapid decline in her mental health and fell into a coma. She died eight months later. After the fall, her family were told she had gone to India to do charity work. At the time of Davies' death her daughter, Morgan-Davies, did not know she was her mother. *Aishah Wahab - a Malaysian woman who moved to the United Kingdom at the age of 24 to study, joining the group shortly after. Aishah was reportedly so drawn in by Balakrishnan's Marxist rhetoric that she left her fiancé and moved in with the collective. *Oh Kar Eng - nurse from Malaysia who had followed Balakrishnan from the 1970s. She hit her head on a cupboard in 2001 and suffered a stroke. No medical treatment was allowed by the commune and she died the next day. The police were not informed of the accident. Her family were not told about her cremation, and they were told the commune did not have their ashes when in fact they were in a lockup garage in West Norwood. *Josephine Herivel - known as Josie, was a violinist studying at the Royal College of Music before she joined the group. Her father, John Herivel was one of the Bletchley Park codebreakers who helped Britain and its allies win World War II. She is believed to have moved to London in the 1970s and disowned her family after becoming involved with the Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought. Herivel initiated the escape plan after becoming concerned with Morgan-Davies rapid weight loss (which was due to undiagnosed diabetes). Medical treatment was not permitted by the commune. Herivel secretly phoned a helpline after memorizing the number from a television program. Herivel has denounced the Balakrishnan sentencing, claiming he has been framed by the state. Imprisonment and rescue The two older victims are believed to have met Balakrishnan in London through, according to police, a shared political ideology,Martin Evans \\"Slavery case: suspects named as former Maoist collective leaders\\", telegraph.co.uk, 25 November 2013 as he was the leader of the Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought.'Slave' house couple 'leaders of 1970s political cult'\\", Channel 4 News, 25 November 2013 The women were not being physically restrained, but held by \\"invisible handcuffs\\" after being subjected to brainwashing, emotional abuse and physical abuse by their captors. The three women, who are not related, are said to have been held captive for more than 30 years with the youngest of the three thought to have spent her whole life in servitude. However it has not yet been established if she was born in the house from where she was rescued. The police were tipped off by Freedom Charity who contacted police following a phone call they had received on 18 October, during which a woman stated that she'd been held unwillingly for more than 30 years.

Social learning has been observed in a variety of animal taxa, such as insects, fish, birds, reptiles, amphibians and mammals (including primates). Social learning is fundamentally different from individual learning, or asocial learning, which involves learning the appropriate responses to an environment through experience and trial and error. Though asocial learning may result in the acquisition of reliable information, it is often costly for the individual to obtain. Therefore, individuals that are able to capitalize on other individuals' self- acquired information may experience a fitness benefit. However, because social learning relies on the actions of others rather than direct contact, it can be unreliable. This is especially true in variable environments, where appropriate behaviors may change frequently. Consequently, social learning is most beneficial in stable environments, in which predators, food, and other stimuli are not likely to change rapidly. When social learning is actively facilitated by an experienced individual, it is classified as teaching. Mechanisms of inadvertent social learning relate primarily to psychological processes in the observer, whereas teaching processes relate specifically to activities of the demonstrator. Studying the mechanisms of information transmission allows researchers to better understand how animals make decisions by observing others' behaviors and obtaining information.  Social learning mechanisms  Social learning occurs when one individual influences the learning of another through various processes. In local enhancement and opportunity providing, the attention of an individual is drawn to a specific location or situation. In stimulus enhancement, emulation, observational conditioning, the observer learns the relationship between a stimulus and a result but does not directly copy the behavior of the experienced individual. In imitation, the observer directly copies the behavior of the animal in order to complete a novel task. All of these mechanisms are possible through inadvertent social learning, without active facilitation from the experienced individual. When an individual more actively influences another's behavior through any one of these mechanisms, the individual becomes a teacher. = Local enhancement = Male guppy In local enhancement, a demonstrator attracts an observer's attention to a particular location. One seminal study with guppies (Poecilia reticulata) demonstrated how local enhancement influenced foraging behavior. Untrained adult female guppies (observers) were given five days of experience swimming with demonstrator fish trained to take one of two equivalent routes to food. When these observers were later isolated, they preferentially used the route their demonstrators had used. These results indicate that guppies learn about their local environments through the social learning mechanism of local enhancement. Local enhancement has also been observed to transmit foraging information in among birds, rats, and pigs. = Opportunity providing = Opportunity providing is a social learning mechanism in which the experienced individual puts the observer in a situation that facilitates the acquisition of knowledge or a new skill. A well known example of unintentional opportunity providing is the transmission of feeding behavior in black rats (Rattus rattus). One pilot study determined that black rats living in the forests of Israel preferentially fed on pine cones instead of other fresh fruits and vegetation nearby. These rats also methodically stripped pine cones rather than gnawing at them randomly. To determine how these food preferences developed, researchers provided naive adult black rats with fresh pine cones in captivity and observed their behavior. After three months of experimentation, they found that none of the rats had successfully opened the pine cones and had instead haphazardly and inefficiently attempted to feed on the cones. In further experiments, the rats were allowed to observe experienced individuals opening the pine cones but were still unable to pick up the skill of pinecone stripping. Eventually, the researchers determined that naive adult rats could learn to strip pine cones efficiently if presented with an already partially stripped cone. This is consistent with opportunity providing because experienced individuals inadvertently provide naive rats with partially stripped cones that facilitate their learning without altering the experienced rats' behavior. Opportunity providing has also been found to be important in the acquisition of tool use by chimpanzees, in which a mother chimpanzee may contribute to the development of her offspring's nut cracking technique by leaving \\"hammer\\", either hard wood or rocks, and nuts in the nest. The infant is thus given the chance to use the hammer in the “proper” context. The mother chimpanzee may provide this opportunity unknowing or actively depending on the situation. = Stimulus enhancement and observational conditioning = In stimulus enhancement, a demonstrator exposes an observer to a particular stimulus, leading to the observer learning the relationship between a stimulus and its result. A study investigating stimulus enhancement in greylag geese (Anser anser) found that individuals that had previously observed a human opening a box preferentially spent more time investigating the box and attempting to open it via trial and error. These geese were also more successful at eventually opening the box in comparison to control geese that had not previously observed a human opening the box. One adult female and one young rhesus macaque Observational conditioning is a phenomenon similar to stimulus enhancement. In observational conditioning, the behavior of the demonstrator exposes the learner to a new relationship between stimuli that it had not previously known, and causes the learner to form an association between them. In an experiment with rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), young monkeys that observed their parents fearfully responding to model snakes also developed a fear of snakes without direct contact. After three months, the observer rhesus macaques still showed strong fearful reactions toward snakes, suggesting that they had formed a strong connection from just observing their parents’ behavior. Another example of this is how blackbirds learn to identify predators; they observe other birds mobbing unfamiliar objects they haven't seen before. = Imitation and emulation = Orangutan eating a coconut In imitation, a learner observes a unique action performed by the demonstrator and learns to reproduce the behavior exactly. (This differs from \\"copying\\" in which the learner reproduces that same action but this is performed with a different part of the body e.g. the left paw is used instead of the right paw.) Researchers conducted studies with marmosets to observe how they learned to access food. When groups of marmosets observed a demonstrator removing the lid with his hands or mouth, they also used only their hands or mouth, respectively. Thus, the marmosets completely imitated their demonstrators. Gorillas and chimpanzees also utilize imitation to learn food handling skills. Emulation is similar to imitation in that after observing a demonstrator interacting with objects in its environment, an observer is more likely to act to bring about a similar effect on those objects, but not necessarily through the same method. In a study with orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), researchers demonstrated that tool use was passed down through emulation. Humans demonstrated the use of a tool to a group of orangutans and then presented orangutans with the same tools and desirable, but out-of-reach, food. Orangutans used the tools to obtain food, but they did not use the same exact methods as the human demonstrators. This suggests that subjects paid attention to the general functional relationship between the task and the result, but did not adhere to the actual methods of tool use demonstrated, and were thus not imitating. In a naturalistic environment, imitative learning is seen in many animal species. Many species of songbirds learn their songs through imitation, and it has been hypothesized that chimpanzees' understanding of intentionality of action in other members of a social group influences their imitative behaviors. Imitation of birdsong As a sexually selected trait, variation in learning of songbird calls is often studied. Lahti et al. performed a study on swamp sparrows (Melospiza georgiana) where young sparrows were exposed to song models with controlled trill rates. Higher trill rates are more difficult to perform and thus are likely more desired in birdsong performance. When exposed to low- performance models, it was found that the learner sparrows sacrificed imitative accuracy for higher performance, while when exposed to high- performance models, imitation was very accurate. The researchers suggest that this study may provide insight into how behaviors learned through imitation can still be selected for due to level of performance. Sewall explored the variation in learned bird songs in relation to social and genetic intermixing of families of red crossbills (Loxia curvirostra). When given to foster parents, it was shown that fledgling crossbills will imitate the particular variations in their foster parents' calls. It was thus hypothesized that such idiosyncrasies in call could aid in creating familial cohesion and that when such call variants are passed down generations, those variants are direct signals of the crossbill's genetic and familial history. MacDougall-Shackleton summarized research that suggests developmental stressors affect bird song learning, and that such discrepancies in call can be identified and selected against in some species of birds. He suggests that while many studies have shown that several species of songbirds prefer the song dialect of their local area, current data is lacking in explaining why this is so. It has been argued that genetic factors may play into this preference as well as social learning. In this study, three separate groups of laboratory-raised house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) were raised hearing the local song dialect, a foreign song dialect, or no song. When adults, all finches showed sexual preference for the local dialect, suggesting an inherited component to song preference. Visual behavioral imitation Pigeons are able to learn behaviors that lead to the delivery of a reward by watching a demonstrator pigeon. A demonstrator pigeon was trained to peck a panel in response to one stimulus (e.g. a red light) and hop on the panel in response to a second stimulus (e.g. a green light). After proficiency in this task was established in the demonstrator pigeon, other learner pigeons were placed in a video-monitored observation chamber. After every second observed trial, these learner pigeons were then individually placed in the demonstrator pigeon's box and presented the same test. The learner pigeons displayed competent performance on the task, and thus it was concluded that the learner pigeons had formed a response-outcome association while observing. However, the researchers noted that an alternative interpretation of these results could be that the learner pigeons had instead acquired outcome-response associations that guided their behavior and that further testing was needed to establish if this was a valid alternative. Carrasco et al. tested a chimpanzee, Lili, and found \\"surprising skill\\" at imitating actions, and behaviors that indicated an intentional change in mimicry. When Lili performed an action with the wrong appendage, she corrected her mistake in subsequent attempts. They concluded that the subject had a complex visual-motor control system and that the behaviors were intentionally imitated rather than solved through stimulus enhancement. Chimpanzees can also imitate. A demonstrator performed the same actions in two conditions: \\"Hands Free\\" and \\"Hands Occupied.\\" It was found that the chimpanzees imitated more often when the demonstrator was in the \\"Hands Free\\" condition, indicating that chimpanzees are able to understand the reasoning behind another being's actions and apply that understanding when imitating others. The performance of opening an artificial fruit after watching a demonstrator was tested in groups of adult pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) and compared to adult humans. The macaques showed weak evidence of imitative learning compared to the adult humans. It was hypothesized that because the macaques were adults, they were less likely to imitate than juvenile monkeys, as accurate imitation may be an adaptation that is more useful to juveniles. Mechanisms for imitative learning Mechanisms that support imitative learning have been studied on the neurological level. Roberts et al. performed research on zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) that explored the importance of neural motor circuitry on birdsong learning. If the premotor nucleus was disrupted while a juvenile finch was learning a song from an older finch, the song was not copied. Images of a finch undergoing various neural manipulations showed that premotor circuits aid in encoding information about songs. Behavioral mechanisms have also been studied. Cecilia Heyes at the University of Oxford argues that the mechanisms underlying social learning in both humans and nonhumans are analogous to those of non-social learning. Observational learning, then, only becomes social when perceptual, attentional, and motivational factors are focused on other organisms by genetic or developmental forces. At different life stages Rats use social learning in a wide range of situations, but perhaps especially so in acquiring food preferences. Learning about suitable foods can be divided into four life stages. *Before birth: In utero, fetal rats detect odor-bearing particles that come from their mother's diet and cross the placental barrier. Shortly after birth, newborn rats respond positively to these foods. *During nursing: Nursing rats receive information about their mother's diet through her milk. They prefer the foods she ate during lactation. *Weaning: When young rats are weaning and eating solid foods for the first time, they use adult rats as guides. They forage where the adults are foraging or where adults have previously scent-marked. *Adolescence and adulthood: When rats forage on their own, their food choices are influenced by social interactions that may take place far away from foraging sites. They smell foods on the fur, whiskers and especially the breath of other rats and strongly prefer the foods those rats had previously eaten.  Teaching  Many of the mechanisms involved in inadvertent social learning are also employed during teaching; the distinction is drawn based upon the role of the demonstrator. From the perspective of the pupil, teaching would be identical to its inadvertent social learning equivalent, but in teaching, a tutor actively demonstrates a behavior pattern or draws attention to a location with the specific function of transmitting information to the pupil. An individual must meet three criteria to qualify as a “teacher”: it modifies its behavior only in the presence of a naive observer, it incurs some cost (or at least, no benefit) to itself in doing so, and the naive observer acquires knowledge or skill more rapidly or efficiently than it might otherwise. All of these criteria are rarely met in animals, and only recently have convincing examples been adequately described. Most identified examples have still not been conclusively proven to meet all criteria and primarily serve to suggest that teaching may occur while acknowledging that further research is needed. Adult killer whales (Orcinus orca) teach the predatory technique of “stranding” to their young. Stranding in these circumstances is a behavior in which a whale temporarily beaches itself to reach prey on land near to the shoreline. Adult whales have been observed helping juveniles with many aspects of this behavior by pushing them up and down the beach, guiding them towards prey, and intervening when the juveniles find themselves in danger. Adults only engage in this behavior with apparently naive juveniles. They are more successful when hunting alone than when teaching juveniles, but case studies suggest that juveniles taught the stranding technique by adults are able to master it more than a year earlier than their non-taught peers. In spiders, the parent spider will teach the offspring not to eat bees. (?This reference is for dolphins, not spiders) Coaching appears to occur in other species as well. In domestic chickens, adult hens encourage safe food choices by responding with increased pecking and scratching at palatable food when chicks consume apparently unpalatable food. = Providing opportunities = Adult meerkats search for prey. Adult meerkats (Suricata suricatta) have been shown to teach pups essential prey- handling skills. Meerkats often consume dangerous prey (such as venomous scorpions) that inexperienced pups appear unable to safely subdue and consume without assistance from older individuals. Adults only display teaching behavior in response to pup begging calls, and adults modify their specific teaching behaviors based upon the age of the pup begging (providing more assistance to younger, presumably less experienced pups). In some instances, providing prey to pups appears costly to adults. Pups are initially unable to find and consume any of their own prey and more rapidly gain predatory abilities through learning experiences from a “teacher”, suggesting that adult teaching facilitates both the speed and efficiency of skill acquisition. Other species appear to similarly teach their young through the provisioning of weakened or otherwise subdued prey. In both cheetahs and domestic cats, adults catch live prey animals and transport them back to cubs, allowing the cubs to learn and practice hunting skills. = Using local enhancement = The lead worker (on the left) has returned to the nest and is leading the remaining workers back to the food source via tandem running. Tandem running in ants provides evidence that teaching can occur even without a large brain with complex cognitive abilities. This behavior is shown by an ant who has located a food source in order to guide a naive ant to the desired location. The leading ant only continues the tandem run if the following ant frequently taps on the leader's body, showing that the leader (teacher) modifies its behavior in the presence of the naive follower. Tandem running appears to impose a significant cost on the leader, slowing its speed to ¼ of what it would be if running alone. But the benefit is clear: evidence suggests that followers find food much more quickly through tandem running than from searching alone. Other evidence of teaching through local enhancement can be seen in a variety of species. In bees, knowledgeable workers perform a waggle dance to guide naive workers to an identified food source. This dance provides information about the direction, distance and quality of the food source. In callitrichid monkeys, adults emit \\"food-offering\\" vocalizations only in the presence of infants that appear to indicate the presence of food or discovery of a hidden prey item.  Relevance of social learning  Social learning is a beneficial means to gather information if asocial learning is particularly costly and would increase risk of predation or expend unnecessary energy. In these types of scenarios, social learners may observe the behaviors of an experienced individual. This allows the observer to gain information about the environment without individually being put at risk. = Predator learning = An animal generally learns its natural predators through direct experience. Thus, predator learning is very costly and increases the predation risk for each individual. In group learning scenarios, a few members can experience the danger of predation and transmit this acquired predator recognition throughout the group. Consequently, in future encounters, the entire group can recognize the threat of predation and respond accordingly. This social learning method has been shown in group mobbing behavior in the common blackbird (Turdus merula). Blackbird groups were more likely to mob an object if a member of the group had previously been conditioned to recognize it as a predator. This behavior has also been recorded in guppies, where naive guppies from environments with less natural predators significantly improved their anti- predator behavior when placed in a group with guppies from a high predation environment. Red squirrels are more successful at opening nuts after watching an experienced individual. = Foraging strategies = Social learning also provides individuals with information about food sources in an environment. This can include information on where to find food, what to eat, and how to eat it. There are several examples in the animal kingdom in which animals utilize social learning to find food. For example, birds are more likely to forage in areas where they already see birds feeding. The Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus) also utilizes social learning behaviors to find food sources. Mature rats leave sensory trails to and from food sources that are preferentially followed by naive pups. Animals can also learn what to eat from social learning with conspecifics. Experimentally discerning harmful foods from edible foods can be dangerous for a naive individual; however, inexperienced individuals can avoid this cost through observing older individuals that already have acquired this knowledge. For example, several species of bird will avoid food if they see another individual eat it and become ill. Observation can also educate the observer about how to eat particular foods. Red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) have been shown to more successfully open hickory nuts after watching more experienced squirrels open the nuts.  Maladaptive examples of social learning  thumbleftWhile asocial learners' fitness remains relatively unchanged regardless of frequency, social learners' fitness is higher when they are relatively rare in the population. Social learners' fitness decreases as their frequency increases. Social learning does not necessarily mean that the transmitted behavior is the most efficient response to a stimulus. If a socially learned behavior expends unnecessary energy, and there is a more efficient strategy that is not being utilized, employing social learning is maladaptive. This has been experimentally demonstrated in guppies. After a group of guppies was trained to swim a more energetically costly route to food, naive guppies were added to the group. These new members were more likely to follow the larger group even if a shorter, more effective route was provided; however, if the naive guppies were not introduced to the trained individuals, they preferentially used the more efficient route to the food source. Norway rats have been shown to abandon previously individually learned habits due to the actions of conspecifics. Rats modified established aversions to certain foods if they observed conspecifics eating those same foods. If this previous aversion was formed for adaptive reasons (i.e. the food was nutrient-poor), reversion to consumption of this food source could reduce the fitness of the individual. More theoretically, social learning can become maladaptive after a certain point in animal populations. If there are more social learners than asocial learners in a particular group, the information transferred between individuals is less likely to be reliable. This could result in maladaptive information transfer to social learners, decreasing the fitness for social learners in comparison to that of asocial learners. Therefore, social learning is only an adaptive strategy if the number of individual learners is equal to or greater than the number of social learners.  Local traditions  When many individuals residing within the same area employ social learning, local traditions can be formed and cultural transmission can occur. These learned behavior complexes shared by individuals appear in the population generation after generation and persist in the behavioral repertoire of individual organisms even following removal from the immediate learning situation. One of the most commonly recognized examples of tradition in animals is found in songbirds, in which the same song pattern is transmitted from generation to generation by vocal imitation. Even \\"alien\\" syllable types not produced by their biological parents can be learned by finches raised by foster canaries in the lab. If copying errors are common, or if each observer adds individually learned modifications to a new behavior pattern, stable traditions are unlikely to develop and persist over time. However, even when no longer adaptive, traditions can be passed down if individuals learn primarily through observing experienced individuals rather than through asocial learning techniques. This was observed in guppies in the laboratory, in the group foraging example explained above. Even when the originally trained “founder” guppies were removed from the group and only initially naive individuals (trained by the founders) were present, the tradition persisted and new guppies learned the costly path. Socially learning the more costly route also resulted in slower learning of the more efficient route when it was subsequently presented, suggesting that even maladaptive strategies can be socially learned and incorporated into local traditions.

The Carniriv () is an annual festival, held in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. The Carnival starts few weeks before Christmas, and lasts for seven days. During this time several ceremonial events are held, most of which hold some cultural and or sacred significance. The Port Harcourt Carnival bears a certain uniqueness as it combines two carnivals - a purely cultural carnival and a contemporary Caribbean style carnival- in one. It also features musical performances from both local and international artists. This gives it an edge over all other regional and continental carnivals, and presents with the principal advantage which must be consummately exploited. The Government of Rivers State recognizes Carniriv as its biggest tourism export. With economic interests increasingly identifying tourism as a viable alternative to the fossil fuel economy- especially in these parts- the state government has exhibited its commitment to developing this carnival into a regionally unrivalled and globally reckoned tourist attraction. Thus, it has always made available the necessary monetary backing needed for the event to hold every year, and has also worked hard through the Rivers State Tourism Development Agency and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism to see that it is held. History By all means, Carniriv ’88 is the direct ancestor of Carniriv: The Port Harcourt Carnival. From 1988, through to 2008, the idea of staging a carnival with statewide participation morphed in a number of forms- most notably in the form of Rivifest - until the emergence of the current carnival. Carniriv: The Port Harcourt Carnival was construed and staged in 2008; and with it came the poignant allure to build a sturdy and ultimately attractive carnival brand. =Orientation= Rivers State is known as the land of a thousand masquerades. With a fine variety of spoken tongues, numbering over 300, it is somewhat easy to discern the beauty in the diversity of its peoples. Very many civilizations, ancient and seemingly ageless as they are, quite simply draw attention to the richness and unspeakable eminence of the collective heritage of the Rivers people. Simply put, we are the microcosm of the macrocosm, a Nigeria (with all of its cultural and ethnic diversity) within Nigeria. This, to all intents and purposes, is at the core of the philosophy and guiding principle of Carniriv: The Port Harcourt Carnival. Events =Garden City Freestyle Parade= The carnival here enters its final day, and the hype and excitement portend to a crescendo. Glamour, style and pageantry all fuse into one fine artistic blend in a contemporary modern cultural procession through the streets of Port Harcourt. Traditionally, 6 bands participate in this procession; with 5 bands (namely: Jubilee, Liberation, Dynamic, Fusion and Treasure Bands) all wrapped-up in fervent competition. =International Heritage Parade= In true carnival style, contingents of the 23 LGAs engage a procession (on a pre-defined route) through the streets of Port Harcourt- showcasing enthralling dances and masquerade displays as they do so. All of these performances are embedded in colourful floats gigged with impressive icons. This year, the Heritage parade goes international with the inclusion of troupes from Malaysia and South Africa as honorary participants. =Kids Carnival= This Carnival is a strong reflection of the importance attached to children in Carniriv, and by extension Tourism Development, in Rivers State. The Children’s Carnival is designed as a mini-procession, commencing at the Elekahia play-ground and culminating in the Liberation Stadium (Elekahia) - where children will be treated to a carnival full offun, refreshment, leisure and unrestrained entertainment befitting of an ice-breaker event in anticipation of the Grand opening of Carniriv 2012.

Its establishment is associated with the Syriac Union Party (SUP).  History  = Integration in the Rojava institutions = With the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War and the Rojava conflict, Sutoro units were first organized in town of al-Qahtaniyah (Qabre Hewore), and soon thereafter in al-Malikiyah (Dayrik). The Syriac Union Party maintains warm and friendly relations with its Kurdish neighbours, and it was one of numerous organisations to join the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) in establishing a formal administration for self-governance in northern Syria called Rojava. Following this policy, the Sutoro has sought to align itself with the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) from an early juncture. Although the Kurds were initially suspicious when it started organising and wanted its members to either disarm or join Kurdish formations, the Sutoro was soon accepted and welcomed by Kurdish forces. It became fully integrated in the administration of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, operating alongside the general Rojavan Asayish police force, manning joint checkpoints and patrolling neighbourhoods together, while its paramilitary counterpart, the Syriac Military Council (MFS), joined an alliance with the YPG in January 2014. = Breakaway of group \\"Sootoro\\" = The Sutoro Police should not be confused with the Sootoro which has the same name in the Syriac language, but uses the English translation \\"Syriac Protection Office\\" and the transliteration \\"Sootoro\\".

He was trained as a painter, but is best known for his fine sculptural work in terracotta and stucco. Life Mazza was born in Bologna on 13 May 1653, son of Camillo Mazza (1602–72). His father was a sculptor who had studied under Alessandro Algardi in Rome, and who worked in Bologna, Padua and Venice.Guida del forestiere per la città di Bologna e suoi sobborghi, by Girolamo Bianconi; Bologna; 1820, page 515. He trained as a sculptor under his father for a while, then studied painting in Bologna under the fresco painter Domenico Maria Canuti. He painted in Carlo Cignani's life classes. He also studied with Lorenzo Pasinelli. He seems to have returned to sculpture after having left Canuti with the painter Giovanni Gioseffo dal Sole and studied at a private school in the Palazzo Fava in Bologna. Mazza became a successful and prolific sculptor, producing many statuettes and reliefs in terracotta. Mazza's fully finished terracotta statuettes would have been intended for cabinet display in the homes of wealthy art lovers. Prince Johann Adam Andreas of Liechtenstein, an art connoisseur, was introduced to Mazza in 1691 by the painter Marcantonio Franceschini. The Prince and Mazza were in correspondence between 1692 and 1702, and Mazza provided a number of works. The Prince tried to persuade Mazza to move to Vienna, but without success. Mazza undertook many commissions for churches. Giuseppe Mazza died in Bologna on 6 June 1741 at the age of 88. The sculptor Angelo Piò and Lorenzo SartiAnnali della città di Bologna dalle sua origine al 1796, by Salvatore Muzzi; Bologna, 1846, Volume 8, page 746. were among Mazza's pupils. A road in Bologna carries his name. Work Mazza painted the figures of adoring angels in a painting of the Virgin and Child displayed in the Capella Maggiore of Bologna Cathedral. The church of the Corpus Domini in Bologna has a Virgin and Child and two large angels by Mazza, who also made the bas-reliefs of the high altar. Most of Mazza's work had religious themes, but he sometimes depicted mythological or secular subjects. Mazza made a number of works for Prince Andreas of Liechtenstein that depicted mythological subjects, including six marble busts and twelve terracotta groups, as well as two marble statues and three terracotta models for vases. The Prince had all the terracotta works copied in stone for his gardens at Rossau. Between 1686 and 1695 Mazza participated, along with the architect Giacomo Monti (1620-1692) and the painter Marcantonio Franceschini (1648-1729), in the renovation of the Corpus Domini church in Bologna. He contributed reliefs and plaster statues. The statues of St Francis and St Clare on the left and right of the high altar were based on Franceschini's basic designs. He made large bronze reliefs for the Church of San Clemente, Venice. In 1722 he made five large bronze reliefs depicting the miracles of Saint Dominic for the Chapel of San Dominico in the church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice.

His early training as a painter is reflected in his later work. His sculptures have a pictorial quality. They are balanced and self-contained. His work shows the influence of Algardi but have the vivacity of 18th century styles. This contrasts with the High Baroque style that was then in fashion in Rome.

It should not be confused with the variation in sharpness which also is due differences partial coherence. The directed bright-field (see Fig. 1) has extremely strong directional characteristics by means of a point source and an optical system (condenser); in this case, each point of the photographic film receives light from only one direction. Figure 1. Directed bright-field On the other hand, in a diffused bright-field setup (see Fig. 2) the illumination of the film is provided through a translucent slab (diffuser), and each point of the film receives light from a wide range of directions. Figure 2. Diffused-bright- field The collimation of the illumination plays a fundamental role in contrast of the image impressed on a film.C. Tuttle. 1926. \\"The relationship between diffuse and specular density.\\" J. Opt. Soc. Am. 12, 6 (1926), 559–565. In case of high scattering fraction, the attenuance provided by the image particles changes considerably with the degree of collimation of the illumination. In Figure 3 the same silver-based film is reproduced in directed and diffused bright-field setups. The global contrast also changes: the contrast on the left is much stronger than that on the right. Figure 3. Images of the same silver-based film acquired in directed and diffused bright-field setups In the absence of scattering, the attenuance provided by the emulsion is independent of the collimation of the illumination; a dense point absorbs a big portion of light and a less dense point absorbs a smaller portion, irrespective of the directional characteristics of the incident light. In Figure 4 are reported the images of a dye-based film acquired in directed and diffused bright-field setups; the global contrast of the two images is about the same. Figure 4. Images of the same dye-based film acquired in directed and diffused bright- field setups The ratio between the attenuances provided by a specific point of a photographic film, which were measured in directed (Ddir) and diffused (Ddif) bright-fields, is termed the Callier Q factor: :Q=\\\\frac{D_\\\\text{dir}}{D_\\\\text{dif}} The Callier Q factor is always equal to or greater than unity; its trend versus the diffusely measured density Ddif is depicted in Figure 5 for a typical silver-based film.J.

Commenting on the album's concept, Henry stated: \\"NOVA' came from obsessive ideation on growth and on transition. The art and stories and the moments that inspired me through this record tend to explore this as well. The feeling of leaving behind what was, and of welcoming the foreign. Throughout the process, I had this vision of a 'nova' or of a star no bigger than a person launching from earth into outer space and expanding endlessly until its light was all that we could see. That's the feeling I get from these records, infinite light.\\" The album's last single, \\"Light Me Up\\", which featured the vocals of Miguel and Julia Michaels, was released on July 25, 2018. Initially an unused Jack Ü demo which was shown to Grime by Diplo, Grime decided to build the demo out and have Miguel's and Michaels' vocals recut, since he felt that the album required a \\"summery vibe\\" to it.

It is made up of fourteen short stories and thirteen vignettes. The novel presents stories that center around a community of South Texan Mexican American migrant farm workers during the late 1940s and early 1950s. The novel begins with the short story \\"A Lost Year\\", in which an unnamed male protagonist cannot seem to remember what occurred during the previous year. The stories and vignettes that follow are fragmented, lack chronology and lack consistency in characters. The last short story, \\"Under the House\\", ties all of these stories together by presenting them as the memories of the male protagonist, who seems to become empowered by the act of remembering. The novel won the Premio Quinto Sol prize for literature in 1970 and has since been adapted into a movie.  Background  = Background and publication = Rivera said he had trouble getting his works published at first, and said some of his manuscripts were probably rejected because he was Chicano. Rivera sent manuscripts everywhere and he said he received \\"thousands\\" of rejections before winning the Quinto Sol award and publishing his novel the subsequent year. = Editions = Rivera, Tomás (1971) ...y no se lo tragó la tierra/...And the Earth Did Not Part.

Rivera, Tomás (2012) ...y no se lo tragó la tierra. Edition and Introduction by Julio Ramos and Gustavo Buenrostro, Buenos Aires: Ediciones Corregidor.  Main themes  = Social change = Many of the short stories in Rivera's novel reveal harrowing conditions that Mexican American migrant workers faced, and thus could be seen as a work that calls for social change to provide better working conditions for Mexican American migrant workers. In the short story \\"The Children Couldn't Wait\\", for example, a little migrant worker boy is shot to death by the farm boss for taking what the boss thought was too many breaks to drink water. Additionally, in \\"The Little Burnt Victims\\", two small children of migrant workers are burned to death in an accidental fire when they are left alone in their house. The parents were discouraged from bringing their children to the fields with them and thus had been forced to leave them at home alone. In this way, problems with working conditions for migrant workers are made clear in many of the stories. Furthermore, in \\"It's That It Hurts\\", the difficulty of getting a quality education for migrant farm worker children is stressed. In the story, a boy gets in trouble for hitting another student back, and knows that he will be expelled. The other boys at school call him \\"Mex\\" and make fun of him, and the principal justifies expelling him by saying, \\"...they could care less if I expel him…they need him in the fields\\". The racism the boy faces at school—both from children and adults—therefore hinders his ability to get a quality education. The stories thus expose dire conditions for Mexican American migrant workers and may be seen as a work that calls for structural changes to occur. = Disillusionment with Mexican American Folk Catholicism = In many of the novel's short stories, the young male protagonist becomes disillusioned with aspects of Folk Catholicism. In \\"A Silvery Night\\", for instance, the boy decides that he will call the devil late at night, but the devil never shows up, even after the boy curses him. He therefore realizes that there is no devil. Similarly, in the short story \\"...And the Earth Did Not Devour Him\\", the boy—angry that his close kin are suffering even though they are good people—curses God, but nothing happens to him as a consequence. In fact, the next day his father and brother are getting over his sickness and the weather is less harsh for working. The developments in these two short stories and in others, as well, point to an overall theme in the novel of a sense of disillusionment with religion. The protagonist seems to embrace rationalist, individualist thinking. = Community building = However, in a chapter in his book Dancing with the Devil, José E. Limón argues that the novel does not in fact celebrate the protagonist's rationalist individualist thinking, and in fact associates him with the devil. Limón makes the point that in order for the boy in the novel to embrace rationality, he must put down and deem backwards his Mexican American culture's folk Catholicism. The boy therefore may be portrayed as the \\"real\\" devil in the story. In fact, Limón points out that in \\"Silvery Night\\", the boy actually puts on a devil's mask, and that in the story \\"...And the Earth Did Not Devour Him\\", the mother says she is afraid that the devil's blood runs through the boy already. Limón therefore suggests that the novel argues for the importance of a communal identity rather than an individualist one. This argument is supported by the fact that the novel brings together a myriad of voices from the Mexican American migrant worker community through the male protagonist's remembering and retelling of the stories, and by the fact that in the last short story the boy states that, \\"I would like to see all of the people together. And then, it I had great big arms, I could embrace them all.\\"  Latin American Edition of Tierra  Julio Ramos and Gustavo Buenrostro edited the first Latin American edition of Tomás Rivera's novel ...y no se lo tragó la tierra (1971).Ramos, Julio; Buenrostro, Gustavo (2012), \\"Prólogo\\", in Rivera, Tomás, ...y no se lo tragó la tierra, Buenos Aires: Corregidor, pp. 9–64, . Ramos and Buenrostro's edition of Tierra inaugurated a collection of Mexican Literature in Argentina. In their extensive introduction, Ramos and Buenrostro argue that Rivera's outstanding fictionalization of memory resists the tendency to aestheticize and heroize the figure of the farm worker; which was a common practice of social realism during the decades of 1930 and 1940. In their introduction, Ramos and Buenrostro coin the notion of \\"lenguas sin estado (languages without state)\\". They also establish a connection between Tomás Rivera, Juan Rulfo, Octavio Paz, and other literatures from the Borderlands. Additionally, the Latin American edition of Tierra includes numerous unpublished materials that show the relationship between Rivera and the editors of the foundational publishing house Quinto Sol. These materials also illustrate the genesis of the novel.

This is the judgement of the Supreme Court of India. The Vishaka Guidelines were a set of procedural guidelines for use in India in cases of sexual harassment. They were promulgated by the Indian Supreme Court in 1997 and were superseded in 2013 by the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013. Background Before 1997, a person facing sexual harassment at workplace had to lodge a complaint under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code 1860 that deals with the 'criminal assault of women to outrage women's modesty', and Section 509 that punishes an individual/individuals for using a 'word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman. During the 1990s, Rajasthan state government employee Bhanwari Devi who tried to prevent child marriage as part of her duties as a worker of the Women Development Programme was raped by the landlords of the gujjar community. The feudal patriarchs who were enraged by her (in their words: \\"a lowly woman from a poor and potter community\\") 'guts' decided to teach her a lesson and raped her repeatedly. The rape survivor did not get justice from Rajasthan High Court and the rapists were allowed to go free. This enraged a women's rights group called Vishaka that filed a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court of India. This case brought to the attention of the Supreme Court of India, \\"the absence of domestic law occupying the field, to formulate effective measures to check the evil of sexual harassment of working women at all work places.\\" Vishaka vs. State of Rajasthan In 1997, the Supreme Court passed a landmark judgment in the same Vishaka case laying down guidelines to be followed by establishments in dealing with complaints about sexual harassment. \\"Vishaka Guidelines\\" were stipulated by the Supreme Court of India, in Vishaka and others v State of Rajasthan case in 1997, regarding sexual harassment at workplace. The court stated that these guidelines were to be implemented until legislation is passed to deal with the issue. The court decided that the consideration of \\"International Conventions and norms are significant for the purpose of interpretation of the guarantee of gender equality, right to work with human dignity in Articles 14, 15 19(1)(g) and 21 of the Constitution and the safeguards against sexual harassment implicit therein.\\"  What is sexual harassment  Sexual harassment includes such unwelcome sexually determined behavior (whether directly or by implication) as: # physical contact and advances; # a demand or request for sexual favors; # sexually colored remarks; # showing pornography; # any other unwelcome physical verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual nature. Where any of these acts is committed in circumstances where the victim has a reasonable apprehension that in relation to the victim’s employment or work whether she is drawing salary, or honorarium or voluntary, whether in government, public or private enterprise such conduct can be humiliating and may constitute a health and safety problem. It is discriminatory for instance when the woman has reasonable grounds to believe that her objection would disadvantage her in connection with her employment or work including recruiting or promotion or when it creates a hostile work environment. Adverse consequences might be visited if the victim does not consent to the conduct in question or raises any objection thereto. Thus, sexual harassment need not involve physical contact. Any act that creates a hostile work environment - be it by virtue of cracking lewd jokes, verbal abuse, circulating lewd rumours etc. counts as sexual harassment. The creation of a hostile work environment through unwelcome physical verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual nature may consist not of a single act but of a pattern of behavior comprising many such acts. Thus, it is important that the victim report such behavior as soon as possible and not wait for it to become worse. In some cases, the psychological stigma of reporting the conduct of a co-worker might require a great deal of courage on the part of the victim and they may report such acts after a long period of time. The guidelines suggest that the complaint mechanism should ensure time bound treatment of complaints, but they do not suggest that a report can only be made within a short period of time since the incident occurred. Often, the police refuse to lodge FIRs for sexual harassment cases, especially where the harassment occurred sometime ago.  Employer's obligations  Note that the Vishaka Guidelines are not sufficient for legal compliance for employers as the same has been replaced by a full-fledged statute of the Parliament. Although the statute mostly retains the framework provided in the Guidelines, there are significant differences and it is the statute that the employers must follow. For instance, the definition of sexual harassment has significantly changed. From this perspective, the Vishaka Guidelines is of only historical and academic importance now. It will also be relevant in cases that were brought up before 2013 enactment of the law. The minister for Women's Welfare Maneka Gandhi stated that government will take tough steps against any organisations, including NGOs that do not implement the new law. It is a good idea to use a checklist to make sure that your organisation is compliant with the law. A sample checklist for sexual harassment compliance is available here. Internal Complaints Committee and Local Complaints Committee: The Sexual Harassment Act requires an employer to set up an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) at each office or branch having more than 10 employees of any gender. The government is in turn required to set up a Local Complaints Committees (LCC) at the district level to investigate complaints regarding sexual harassment from establishments where the ICC has not been constituted on account of the establishment having less than 10 employees or if the complaint is against the employer. The Sexual Harassment Act, 2013 also sets out the constitution of the committees, process to be followed for making a complaint and inquiring into the complaint in a time bound manner. Interim Reliefs: The Sexual Harassment Act empowers the ICC and the LCC to recommend to the employer, at the request of the aggrieved employee, interim measures such as (i) transfer of the aggrieved woman or the respondent to any other workplace; or (ii) granting leave to the aggrieved woman up to a period of three months in addition to her regular statutory/ contractual leave entitlement. In addition to ensuring compliance with the other provisions stipulated, the Sexual Harassment Act casts certain obligations upon the employer to, inter-alia, * provide a safe working environment * display conspicuously at the workplace, the penal consequences of indulging in acts that may constitute sexual harassment and the composition of the Internal Complaints Committee * organise workshops and awareness programmes at regular intervals for sensitizing employees on the issues and implications of workplace sexual harassment and organizing orientation programmes for members of the Internal Complaints Committee * treat sexual harassment as a misconduct under the service rules and initiate action for misconduct. * The employer is also required to monitor the timely submission of reports by the ICC. If an employer fails to constitute an Internal Complaints Committee or does not comply with any provisions contained therein, the Sexual Harassment Act prescribes a monetary penalty of up to INR 50,000 (approx. US$1,000). A repetition of the same offence could result in the punishment being doubled and / or de-registration of the entity or revocation of any statutory business licenses.  Preventive steps  * Sexual harassment should be affirmatively discussed at workers' meetings, employer-employee meetings, etc. * Guidelines should be prominently displayed to create awareness about the rights of female employees. * The employer should assist persons affected in cases of sexual harassment by outsiders. * Central and state governments must adopt measures, including legislation, to ensure that private employers also observe the guidelines. * Names and contact numbers of members of the complaints committee must be prominently displayed.  Recommendations  National Commission for Women has asked the government to ensure constitution of Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) in accordance with Supreme Court guidelines in its departments, institutions and autonomous bodies to address such cases. It has also recommended conducting gender sensitisation workshops for top level management officials. NCW recommended publicizing committee using posters, etc. and explicitly mention the contact details of the members. The commission also highlighted the need for orientation programs for employees to sensitize them on sexual harassment. Another recommendation was to enhance communication strategies to combat violation against women. The rules for the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 came into force on 9 December 2013. http://www.lawyerscollective.org/wp- content/uploads/2013/12/Sexual-Harassment-at-Workplace-Rules.pdf See also * The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 References  External links  Supreme Court of India cases Women in India Sexual harassment in India 1997 in law ","title":"Vishaka Guidelines"},{"id":"41150143","text":"Jack Bass is an American author and journalist.

It stars Bruce Boxleitner as a sheriff who must stop a Native American monster from destroying his town. It premiered on Syfy and was later released on DVD.  Plot  An unscrupulous land developer, Big Jim Burns, ignores the protests of Native Americans as he violates their ancestral burial grounds. The local sheriff, Steve Evans, is caught in the middle of the conflict, as he is half Native American and half Caucasian. When one of Burns' construction crews unearths an ancient relic, they unleash a giant skeletal monster that proceeds to kill everyone in its path. Evans must deal with his rebellious daughter, unhelpful bureaucrats, and Johnny Black Hawk, a Native American who agitates for violence.

He competed internationally on the US National Wildwater Team.  Adventurer  McEwan is credited with numerous first descents including the Great Falls of the Potomac in 1975, the 1973 descent of approx. 8 miles of Linville Gorge, with Jamie McEwan. He, Jamie McEvan, Andy Bridge and Wick Walker were the first to explore the Mexican whitewater on the Santa Maria in 1985. In 1981 McEwan participated in an expedition to Bhutan with Wick Walker, Les Bechdel, Eric Evans, Jamie McEwan, with Ed Hixon in support, on the Wong Chu, Para Chu, Pho Chu, and Mo Chu. In 1998, McEwan and his brother Jamie, Roger Zbel and Doug Gordon were the kayaking members of an expedition to run the Tsangpo Gorge, considered the \\"Mount Everest\\" of rivers. They were supported by Wick Walker, Harry and Doris Wetherbee, Paulo Castillo, and Dave Phillips. The expedition encountered unanticipated high water and ended in tragedy when teammate Doug Gordon capsized, missed his roll and died.  Educator  While adventures are exciting to people and can expand humanity's horizons, Tom McEwan has arguably had a far great impact on the world through his leadership as an educator through his numerous roles at summer camps. In the United States, many school districts have a long break during summer. Camps exist to give children productive outlets for their physical energy and engage them in a variety of important skills and experiences devalued in modern classroom curricula. In this context, Tom McEwan has served in a variety of capacities as a hands-on educator, leader, and director of various summer camps, most notably Valley Mill Camp in Germantown, MD. Tom currently runs the Liquid Adventures Kayak School in Cabin John, MD. It is difficult to identify a simple metric to value his role overseeing thousands of children over many years, but one can easily recognize his tutelage and adventuring lineage of a large number of accomplished kayakers, such as World Cup champion Andy Bridge, Olympic gold metalist Joe Jacobi, adventurer John Weld, and University of California full professor of river science Gregory Pasternack. McEwan's teaching style was a blend of hands-on training and leading by example. During summer weekends, McEwan would take a group of campers to kayak whitewater rivers that would shock many parents in the current culture of over-protectionism. During these trips, students would follow McEwan from eddy to eddy working down rapids, but also practice a variety of intricate maneuvers quite different from what other boats would be doing. These activities developed a deep alternative mindset for thinking about how rivers function and how to navigate them, and these insights can be seen in how students who trained with McEwan have become creative leaders. Also, by example McEwan taught students to work hard at times when others would rest. For example, many whitewater reaches end in reservoirs, but rather than casually drifting through the, McEwan set a challenging pace for teens a third of his age to try to keep up with. His paddling form was heavily influenced by experience in wildwater kayaks, and he also trained students in these unusual forms of boats.

An unknown number of people were able to leave the store on their own after the initial collapse. It was the worst disaster in Latvia since 1950, when the steamer Mayakovsky sank in Riga, killing 147 people. Building overview The building, which contained a Maxima supermarket and other businesses, was completed on 3 November 2011. Architectural design was by Zane Kalinka and Andris Kalinka from the local architectural firm KUBS. It was developed by Homburg Valda and built by the Reℜ company. When the building was finished, it won the Latvian Building of the Year award. Several months before its opening, a fire broke out in the market in which nobody was injured. At the time of the collapse, construction by Reℜ was taking place. The area of the shopping centre was , and the building cost around €1.4 million. The shopping centre was located in a part of the building owned by SIA Tineo, but it was originally owned by The Homburg Group, which still owns the adjacent apartment building. Tineo is an offshore company owned by the Maxima group, a retail chain with operations mostly in the Baltic states, which owns the \\"Maxima XX\\" supermarket in the building. The company initially claimed it was a tenant of the building. The building also contained a bank, a beauty salon, a currency exchange, a newsagent's and a pet shop. There were plans for a layer of topsoil thick on the roof; small recreational spots with benches, connected by cobblestone-paved paths, were planned for the resident of an apartment house that was part of the same complex. Before the collapse, construction of the green roof was in progress, as was construction of underground car parking in the basement, intended for residents of the building. Collapse  Rescuers gathered near the entrance of the store Eyewitnesses said that at around 16:21 a fire alarm was set off and there were announcements made that the store should be evacuated. Security personnel verified this to be related to welding construction in the basement and switched off the alarm. It was later reported that the owner of the company which had installed the alarm said that it was designed to detect fire emergencies. He said it is unlikely that the alarm was set off by dust from the roof starting to collapse, as it was set off near water pipes in the basement. The store's security verified that there was no fire and therefore did not carry out an evacuation, but rather treated it as a false alarm and called a technician to turn it off. The building collapsed shortly after the technician arrived and he was not able to verify why the alarm had gone off. A board member of \\"Maxima Latvija\\" said that security had followed protocol, which was not to evacuate if there was no visible danger. According to some reports, the smaller shops in the retail centre, unlike Maxima, were evacuated and closed. Many customers, however, stayed in the store, encouraged by the calm demeanor of Maxima's employees. Some employees of the smaller shops also started returning to their workplaces after being told by security that it was a false alarm. It has also been reported by witnesses that at around 17:00 the alarm was turned off. The roof caved in at 17:41 local time. Because the collapse occurred during peak shopping hours, it was suspected that at least a hundred people may have been in the store during the collapse. Eyewitnesses said the roof collapsed over the checkout counters, where many people were waiting to pay, and over the dairy, alcoholic beverage and household chemicals sections. This was confirmed by police who released a map based on CCTV footage just before the collapse. It was later reported that the collapse started over counters 6, 7 and 8. There were more than 50 employees working in the various stores in the building and an uncertain number of customers that might have been in the building, many of whom were able to escape before rescuers arrived. Most of the store lost electrical power due to damage caused by the collapse, which resulted in the main door locking and trapping several people inside the store, people had to break the glass to escape. The roof fell into the building, and also onto several cars parked outside the store. The firefighters, ambulances and police arrived at the scene within minutes. After the initial collapse, firefighters divided the building into four working areas. Although it had initially seemed that the remaining roof construction posed no further danger, at 19:04 another part of the roof collapsed over one of the previously designated work areas, trapping several firefighters, injuring twelve and killing three of them. By that time 20 people – most of those injured in the first collapse – had been rescued. The injured were transferred to the Pauls Stradins Clinical University Hospital, the Riga East Clinical university hospital, the Riga Second hospital, and the Traumatology and Orthopedic hospital. One child was transferred to the Clinical University Hospital for children. Both before and after the second collapse, only firefighters were allowed to enter the building, and anyone inside was pulled out and brought to the ambulances parked just outside the store. After the second collapse, it was reported that only five firefighters were allowed to enter the building at a time, and that the rest were forced to wait outside because of the danger of further collapse. Each firefighter was allowed to spend only half an hour working. Bulldozers were used to clear the rubble. Mobile cranes were deployed at 21:27 to lift concrete slabs. According to a Latvian army tweet, 110 soldiers were on site on 21 November. Several tents were installed for the use of firefighters and ambulance workers by the military. Latvia was offered aid by several countries, however it was turned down as State and fire rescue service believed they already had the required manpower, equipment and experience for the rescue operation. At least one silent period was used to listen for signs of life among the rubble; some cell phones were heard ringing. The use of thermal scanners and Search and rescue dogs was also tried, however this proved unsuccessful as concrete rubble was too thick to detect warmth and dogs were distracted by the strong scent of household chemicals and alcohol that had leaked from broken packing. Another fireman was reported to have been injured during clearing of the rubble in the early hours of 23 November. Another collapse occurred at 17:52 on 23 November. None of the rescuers were harmed in this subsequent collapse. As the third collapse compromised the structural integrity of the roof, rescue efforts were stopped at around 19:00. A representative of the paramedics said that, given the severity of injuries the bodies of the latest victims had, they had no hope anyone else might still be alive. The rescue was restarted the following afternoon. There were no more victims found in the rubble and rescue work was finished on 25 November. Candles and flowers in memory of the victims. The rubble can be seen in the background. The fatalities have been identified as 51 citizens of Latvia,http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/33833/ 2 citizens of RussiaAt least 53 dead after Latvia mall collapse (PHOTOS, VIDEO). RT. 21 November 2013. and 1 citizen of Armenia. Aftermath After the disaster, the Mayor of Riga Nils Ušakovs gave an order to inspect all building projects carried out by Re&Re.; The developer of the apartment building put additional construction on hold. The apartment building itself was not damaged in the incident. Maxima agreed to pay compensation to the victims and families of the dead. Investigation and cause The inquiry into the collapse began just minutes after it occurred. The police investigated three theories: first, that there was an error in structural design, and authorities overseeing planning had been negligent; second, that the cause is related to initial building procedures; third, that it was caused by the construction of the green roof. In a related case on 27 February 2014 a man was fined for signature forgery on documents related to construction works in 2011. The police announced this finding in March, but did not disclose any further information. Latvian Television ran a report in April alleging that the person fined was owner of a now liquidated company MONCE – a subcontractor hired to install the metal constructions of the building by the manufacturer of the constructions Vikom Industry. Instead of hiring a certified building engineer to oversee the installation, the company had forged the documents using the name of an engineer, whom they previously had offered a job and paid him a token salary of 5.95 lats a month from January to April 2011, which he actually never received. The investigation of the cause of collapse was hindered by the collapsed building still being unsafe to enter. The remaining constructions were reinforced by March 2014. From April 2014, investigators were finally able to enter the building, where they recovered evidence buried by the third collapse of the roof and carried out investigation experiments – a controlled collapse of the remaining section of the roof and controlled fires, to test what loads the roof could carry and if the building's structures could have been compromised in the fire which occurred during its construction. The preliminary findings from the controlled collapse, which took place from 14 to 17 April showed prolonged deformation of the metal support structures, which started well before the target weight of the roof was reached and ended with the constructions eventually breaking, suggesting that the roof was built improperly and the actual collapse was not caused by a sudden change, but by overloading structures for a prolonged period of time and possibly metal fatigue. Two controlled fires were set on 27 May. The police did not disclose preliminary results of this experiment and said that they aim to complete investigation in late fall. On 10 June 2014 it was announced that a separate criminal inquiry has been launched to verify findings of State Labour Inspectorate, which reported work safety violations in Maxima. The police concluded investigation on the site on 28 July 2014. In January 2015 the first suspects were named – construction engineer Ivars Sergets, design expert Andris Gulbis and architect Andris Kalinka. In addition the assets of HND Grupa (a company owned by Sergets) and Kubs (owned by Kalinka and his sister) were frozen. It is unclear what the architect is suspected for as both the investigators and his representatives refused to comment. Sergets is suspected of making an error in the designs of the building's roof constructions. Gulbis is suspected of negligence as he was supposed to inspect and approve the design, but failed to notice the error. Prosecutor general Ēriks Kalnmeiers cautioned that the investigation is still ongoing and there will be more suspects. He said that the way the building was designed meant it was bound to collapse, however, the investigation had uncovered other factors that contributed to the collapse occurring at a particular time and therefore resulting in deaths, as well as numerous unrelated violations, which speak of a general tendency to disregard regulations, therefore everyone who had been neglectful contributed to the accident and should be held responsible. The trial began on 8 December 2015 for the 9 accused persons: construction engineer Ivars Sergets, architect Andris Kalinka, construction expert Andris Gulbis, construction inspector Mārtiņš Draudiņš, head of construction at the Reℜ Staņislavs Kumpiņš, representatives of the Riga construction board Jānis Balodis, Marika Treija and Aija Meļņikova and employee of the Maxima supermarket Inna Šuvajeva. The trial was held in Ķīpsala International Exposition Centre outside court buildings due to the several hundred people involved, with 263 named as victims and 144 as witnesses.https://eng.lsm.lv/article/society/society/zolitude-supermarket- disaster-trial-starts.a158603/ Verdicts were delivered on 18 February 2020. Eight of the nine defendants were acquitted. The building's civil engineer Ivars Sergets was sentenced to six-year imprisonment for making gross errors in the structural calculations, which directly led to the collapse.https://eng.lsm.lv/article/society/crime/verdicts-delivered-in- zolitude-tragedy-case.a348764/ = Initial speculations on the cause= According to Re & Re's preliminary report, the cause was likely a design error. The report is a result of three independent civil engineers' examination of the project documentation. The rooftop garden was included in the original design, but the building was still \\"designed with insufficient load carrying capacity, three times less than required\\". The report states that the main reasons for the collapse are faulty estimation of the maximum load to be carried by the roof, and the design of the connections in the structural steel supporting the roof. According to Ivars Sergets, the owner of the HND Grupa which was responsible for the construction of the building, the collapse may have been caused by overload, created by materials being loaded onto weaker points of the roof. He rejected the possibility that the disaster had been caused by the design of the garden, since the store had been operating for two winters and the stress created by the weight of snow had been up to twice as great as the stress caused by the garden at the time of the collapse. He pointed out that too many of the building materials were stored on the roof. Later on, however, he admitted that trusses made of two pieces bolted together were used, while the original design called for a single truss. This was a result of issues with transporting longer trusses to the building site. Lilita Ozola, an engineer teaching at the Latvian University of Agriculture, suggested that for changing the trusses the entire design plan should have been revised and reapproved by authorities. With the two-piece trusses installed, the joint between them would bear most of the roof's weight. She pointed out that there is a video recording of the shopping centre's roof collapsing in which it is obvious that it failed at the exact position of the joints. She also criticised construction work taking place on the roof when there were people in the building. Toomas Kaljas, who claims to be a structural engineer working for a Finnish company, has published research based on photographs from the site, suggesting the connections between the horizontal bars that held the roof were inadequately designed. The garden on the roof played a minimal role. The load on the bolts that were holding the bars was uneven and there were too few of them. The calculations of forces applied to bolts were wrong. A better design would have resulted in components bending and cracking over time, instead of the whole building suddenly collapsing like dominoes without warning. Kaljas tested some nuts which were built to meet DIN 934 standard and which, according to him, are available in any hardware store. He found that these are not strong enough. A solution would have been to either get stronger nuts, or place two of them on the end of the same bolt. According to Toomas, the building designer should have issued a standard for the required nuts or, if not, then the builders should have asked for it. He thinks all public buildings that use these bolts should get additional nuts. Latvian state police has called into question the competence of Kaljas stating that he was not able to produce his credentials. It is also speculated that he has connections to Vikom Industry, although he himself has denied it. According to a press representative of Kubs, the architect bureau that designed the building, the possibly faulty metal joint components were supplied by Vikom Industry. The management at Vikom Industry had said that they were unable to provide single-piece components and offered components that would be assembled out of two-halves, but which would be just as strong as the ones ordered. Therefore, according to Kubs, Vikom Industry is solely responsible for the component and bolt force and strength calculations. Vladislavs Podgurskis, a representative of Vikom Industry, said in response that all metal components were made and assembled strictly according to the building design and that it must be a design error. Vikom Industry said the bolts for joining the trusses had been supplied by the Eurobolts company. On 25 November Vikom Industry requested a manufacturer's certificate from Eurobolts for a certain batch of bolts. The owner and CEO of Eurobolts, Olga Romanova, said that the company has no information on what the bolts they sell are used for, however, the bolts in the batch Vikom Industry was interested in were not strong enough for joining trusses for the roof and that Vikom Industry had in fact never bought bolts that would be strong enough for that purpose. She added that judging from photographs of the trusses on the scene of the incident even smaller bolts were used. An anonymous fireman told TV3 News that the bolts he had seen on scene had not been broken, rather pulled out from fastenings, indicating the bolts were not designed for bearing the weight of the roof. The vice director of the Latvian Fire Safety and Civil Defence College, Vilis Students, who participated in the rescue work, said that the concrete components seemed unexpectedly fragile. Translated quote: \\"I am no specialist, but we could break the roof components with hammers and pliers. During exercises with concrete objects, we usually had to use a jackhammer.\\" According to Maxima staff, the building had been dangerously unstable for about a year. The construction workers had told them that the foundation was cracked and needed reinforcement. At one point the storage room and store workers' locker room was completely flooded. There had also been extra support columns under the ceiling of the storage room, but those had been removed later. The fire alarm sounded frequently. The staff believe that the reason for the alarm was that it was obsolete and could not distinguish smoke from dust. The workers did not want to testify about this in front of a camera because they feared for their jobs.  Political reaction  On 23 November, Latvian President Andris Bērziņš stated that the collapse was a \\"murder of defenseless people\\" and that the \\"perpetrators should be arrested\\", and that the inquiry needed independent experts from other countries who are not associated with Latvian builders in any possible way. He also said that the entire political system needs to be changed as it allows individuals to escape responsibility. The BBC News Riga correspondent reported that the president wanted a criminal investigation \\"led by independent investigators from abroad – implying that powerful business interests in Latvia are too closely entwined with politics to ensure a fair and honest investigation.\\" Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis resigned on 27 November. He said that the country needed strong government with support in parliament at the moment of crisis and that he was thus taking responsibility for the incident. He also said he had considered this in the days after the tragedy and had made a final decision during a meeting with the president, but denied the president had asked him to step down. Opinion polls indicate that most people want mayor of Riga Nils Ušakovs to also step down. As political commentator Aivars Ozoliņš points out, since the Riga city council controls the local building authority responsible for the quality of buildings in Riga it was Ušakovs, not Dombrovskis, who should have taken political responsibility for the incident. Soon after the collapse several experts cited abolishing state building inspection among the reasons why control over building processes has lessened. This was done as a result of budget cuts during the global economic crisis as it was thought that municipal building authorities perform the same tasks. This was done in 2009 by the government of Valdis Dombrovskis. Ušakovs has cited this as the reason why the government of Dombrovskis was responsible; however he himself was a member of the Saeima when this decision was made and supported it in parliament. The incident also caused some tension between Latvia and Lithuania after the top management of the Lithuanian-owned chain refused to take any responsibility for the incident. In particular, the CEO of Maxima Latvija, Gintaras Jasinskas, when asked if he had considered stepping down like Dombrovskis, caused outrage by saying \\"Why? Those who feel guilty should step down. I can look people in the eye\\". This was condemned by several Latvian politicians and the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the Lithuanian ambassador to express official condemnation. Jasinskas was sacked and Lithuania expressed regret over his actions.  Parliamentary investigation  Saeima's Zolitūde tragedy investigatory committee meeting on 23 March 2015 On 11 November 2014 members of the 12th convocation of Saeima, at the request of 36 deputies, voted in favour of establishing the Zolitūde tragedy parliamentary investigatory committee. The committee was appointed for the period of 12 months to investigate the actions taken by the state of Latvia in assessing the causes of the tragedy as well as measures taken by the government to prevent the recurrence of similar tragedies and mitigate the consequences of the tragedy. The committee devoted most of its attention to issues in the construction sector of the economy, including state and municipal supervision of the construction sector (especially the dissolution of the State Construction Inspection Office and the creation of the National Construction Control Agency), quality of construction engineering education and the certification system, public procurement in construction sector, supervision of the market of construction materials and other questions. Addressing issues related to civil defence and social assistance, the committee in its sittings examined the following topics: competence of the employees of the security company ; cooperation between rescue services and municipalities in emergency situations, coordination of emergency response and mitigation of accident impact, resources of the responsible services; involvement of non-government organisations in emergency situations, in organizing social support; emergency social care package offered by the state and municipalities, and other topics.Zolitūdes traģēdijas parlamentārās izmeklēšanas komisijas sēžu protokli Nr. 5.-19., http://zolitude.saeima.lv/komisijas-sezu-protokoli The final report of the committee was adopted on the committee meeting on 27 October 2015 and has been published in the official journal \\"Latvijas Vēstnesis\\" in Latvian and English. In the final report the committee named seven persons as morally and politically responsible for the tragedy: * former Prime Minister, Valdis Dombrovskis; * former Ministers for Economics, Artis Kampars and Daniels Pavļuts; * former state secretaries of the Ministry of Economics, Anrijs Matīss and Juris Pūce; * Mayor of Riga, Nils Ušakovs; * Head of the Riga Construction Board, Inguss Vircavs. Protests A protest movement against the parties involved sprung up after the incident. Maxima stores were boycotted due in part to statements by its management after the shopping centre's roof collapsed, and also due to reports of exploitation of workers and poor product quality. Several employees, including those that worked in the collapsed store, told media that they received insufficient safety instructions, fire escape doors were blocked, they were not allowed to leave work without permission even to visit the toilet and would have their pay reduced if they failed to comply. The stores would also keep only a few checkout counters open in order to save money, causing long lines to form, requiring employees to work long hours, while paying the minimum wage. Maxima was also criticised for apparently intimidating workers to keep them from reporting discrepancies to authorities, talking to media or joining a trade union. The company was also accused of lying in the wake of the tragedy for initially denying owning the building and for saying that their safety instructions, which required evacuation only when it had been verified there was obvious danger, had been approved by the State Fire and Rescue Service There also have been protests against Maxima in Lithuania. Reactions The Latvian president stated that the Saturday, Sunday and Monday immediately following the disaster would be days of mourning and sent condolences to Armenia in response to the death of one of its citizens. The families of victims requested that all objects at the site of the disaster be dismantled and evacuated, including the 12-story apartment building owned by Homburg Zolitude.https://eng.lsm.lv/article/society/society/families-of-zolitude- tragedy-demand-memorial.a95154/ The Mayor of Riga Nils Ušakovs said that the Maxima building would be demolished and have a temporary memorial built in its place.https://eng.lsm.lv/article/society/society/two-years-after-zolitude- disaster-temporary-memorial-is-planned.a143345/ Since them, relatives of victims have asked for a proper memorial in its place.https://eng.lsm.lv/article/society/crime/six-years-since-the-zolitude- tragedy-in-latvia-lengthy-proceedings-continue.a339115/ Riga Council and Estonian real estate company Prana Property could not come to an agreement whereas the Council would purchase the land and the unfinished apartment building for 200,000 Euro, demolish it and build a memorial. However, Prana Property countered that they had purchased the property for 4 million and could finish the construction of the apartment building.https://www.lsm.lv/raksts/zinas/latvija/uznemums-nepiekrit-rigas- domes-piedavajumam-atpirkt-ipasuma-dalas-zolitudestragedijas-vieta.a298733/ In the end, the parties agreed to end co-ownership of the land and the company would keep the apartment building property and provide access to the future memorial, while the Council would demolish the underground parking section and construct a memorial.https://www.apollo.lv/6719842/zolitudes-tragedijas-vieta- bus-gan-dzivojamais-nams-gan-pieminas-vieta In almost all Latvian embassies, people were allowed to write their names in condolence books. The Latvian Lutheran and Russian Orthodox church organisations urged people to pray for the victims of the tragedy. Representatives of Maxima Latvia expressed condolences to the families of the deceased. After an emergency meeting, the board of Maxima promised that inspections would be carried out on all Maxima stores. Lithuania and Estonia declared a day of mourning on 24 November.

It focuses on a detective who is trying to solve a string of grisly murders and disappearances. Kong, a recent college graduate, was given a $4.5 million budget from her then-husband Bill Osco to write and direct a film. Principal photography began in 1980 under the title Easter Sunday. Plot In the town of Pottsville, Idaho, citizens begin disappearing. Young Michael Smith, son of Marge Smith (Dorothy Malone) is the first to vanish. A young man is decapitated while fleeing from an unseen assailant, and patrons at a drive-in theater are brutally murdered. At each scene, green slime is found. Wanting to get to the bottom of the disappearances but afraid that the publicity might damage the town's potato business, Mayor Gordon Lane (José Ferrer) hires chemical safety engineer Garcon Jones (Martin Landau) to investigate. Also investigating the disappearances is Detective Mortimer Lutz (Bill Osco), who senses that something terrible has befallen the town. Meanwhile, more and more people disappear, with a puddle of green slime found at each site. With this new string of disappearances Lutz begins to suspect that Jones knows more than he is willing to tell. His suspicions grow when he is attacked by something monstrous while at home, with Lutz barely managing to escape from his attacker. Lutz confronts Jones about the incident but is told that there is nothing wrong in the area. The following night while Lutz takes his waitress girlfriend Laurie (Marianne Gordon) home, they are suddenly attacked by a hideous creature. After holing themselves inside a diner they manage to lock it inside a freezer. The couple then contacts Mayor Lane, however when he arrives they discover that the creature has vanished, leaving behind a puddle of green slime. In light of this recent attack, Lutz confronts Jones again who then admits that a highly radioactive creature is responsible. It's revealed that the town is home to one of 2,000 nuclear dump sites in the U.S. and the creature (who is implied to be young Michael Smith) is the resulting mutation due to repeated exposure to the site's radioactive materials. The mutant, while intelligent, is completely psychotic and sensitive to light and is inactive during the day. Arming themselves with shotguns, Jones and Lutz eventually manage to track the creature down to an abandoned warehouse where they are stalked by the hungry mutant. Jones is soon attacked and disemboweled by the creature, leaving Lutz alone to fend off the creature. Donning a gas mask, Lutz attempts to kill the creature with poison gas but it seems unfazed by the poisonous fumes and tosses Lutz around like a ragdoll. As the creature advances Lutz manages to toss a beaker of acid into the creature's face momentarily stunning it. Taking advantage of the creature's distraction, Lutz grabs a nearby axe and hacks the creature to death, ending the creature's reign of terror. A new mutation is seen bursting from the ground.  Cast  * Martin Landau as Garson Jones * Marianne Gordon as Laurie * Bill Osco as Detective Mortimer Lutz * José Ferrer as Mayor Gordon Lane * Dorothy Malone as Marge Smith * Ruth Buzzi as Virginia Lane Cast notes: *Marianne Gordon was married to singer Kenny Rogers at the time, and is billed as \\"Marianne Gordon Rogers\\"  Production  Kong, a recent college graduate, was given a $4.5 million dollar budget from then-husband Bill Osco to write and direct a film, despite the fact that she had no professional film-making experience. She stated that she impressed Osco with storyboards and shot breakdowns. Kong wooed Martin Landau by pretending to be an actor interested in his theater workshop, and using the opportunity to give him her script. Impressed with her straightforwardness, he accepted the role. It would mark producer and occasional actor Osco's departure from his previous sexually explicit films such as the 1974 sexploitation film Flesh Gordon. Principal photography began in 1980 under the title Easter Sunday. Release =Theatrical release= During the film's production it was intended that the film would be released on Easter in 1981. However, the film could not find a distributor for three years, and was finally released on November 18, 1983 under its new title. The Being was a commercial failure, performing poorly at the box office. =Home media= The Being was released on DVD on September 13, 2005 by Shriek Studio in widescreen format with no special features. Shriek Studio released it again on July 31, 2007 as a part its Mutant Monsters Triple Feature which combined it with The Dark and Creatures from the Abyss. It was last released by Code Red as a double feature alongside Cop Killers. Critical response Critical response for The Being has been mostly negative, with many criticizing the film's acting, script, editing, and poor lighting. Scott Weinberg from DVD Talk was among the film's detractors calling the film \\"Grungy, muddy-looking\\" he also called it a \\"blatant Alien ripoff\\". J. Read from Monstersatplay.com called it \\"cheap, rushed, and an incongruous mess\\" stating it as a perfect example of all the bad movies that came out in the 1980s. Allmovie called the film \\"abysmal\\", with \\"clumsy, ham-fisted\\" direction,\\"lack of focus\\", \\"goofy\\" effects, and a \\"leaden, noncharismatic\\" performance from lead actor and producer Bill Osco. Nevertheless, the reviewer calls it \\"worthy of note for cinematic trash-fiends\\", because of its cast, flashes of humor and \\"oddball qualities\\".Guarisco, Donald. \\"Review\\" on Allmovie.com TV Guide gave the film a negative review awarding it a score of 1 1/2 out of 4, stating, \\"The biggest mystery about this mystery-horror film is how the producer ever managed to persuade two Oscar winners (Dorothy Malone and Jose Ferrer) to appear in such cinematic Valium\\". Robert Firsching from New York Times panned the film, calling it, \\"abysmal\\". Leonard Maltin awarded the film 1 stars out of 4 stating that humor was the film's only saving grace, stating that \\"it wasn't enough to overcome its Z-grade script and production\\". Jack Sommersby from eFilmCritic.com gave the film a negative review, writing, \\" it's not the worst of its type but not quite good enough to warrant a recommendation\\". Brett Gallman from Oh, the Horror! wrote, \\"The Being manages an odd, offbeat quality despite its familiarity. It’s a film that features an amorphous killer alien but also takes the time to consider Pottsville’s other plights, such as the impending arrival of a massage parlor that has the moral majority in a tizzy. Osco’s voiceover narration and interior monologues abruptly stop midway through the film, and even the Easter setting is entirely incidental\\". Legacy In spite of the film's critical and commercial failure, The Being would gain a small cult following over the years since its release. Kong would go on to direct Night Patrol (1984) and the 1987 cult horror film Blood Diner.

(RBI) is an Austrian banking group, itself is a central institution of the Raiffeisen Banking Group Austria (RBG). The central bank is listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange, with the regional banks of RBG were the major shareholder of the central bank, via a shareholders' agreement. Raiffeisen Bank International was a subsidiary of Raiffeisen Zentralbank Österreich (RZB Group). In 2017, Raiffeisen Bank International reverse-merged with its parent company Raiffeisen Zentralbank Österreich. Due to its size, Raiffeisen Bank International was supervised by the European Central Bank directly (as 1 of the 126 banking group). History A subsidiary of Raiffeisen Zentralbank Österreich, Raiffeisen Bank International operates a banking network in Central and Eastern Europe. 17 markets are covered with subsidiary banks, leasing companies and representative offices. As of end-2010, RBI served more than 14 million customers via roughly 3,000 branch offices. At the end of February 2010, RZB CEO Walter Rothensteiner announced that a possible merger of RZB with Raiffeisen International Bank- Holding AG (RI) was being considered. This move would open up broader access to the capital, money and bond markets. As all of these changes would take place within the group, it would have no impact on the equity capital ratios. The newly founded Raiffeisen Bank International AG would contain RI and those parts of RZB that do not involve business with the Raiffeisen sector. Business related to RZB's function as the central institution of the Raiffeisen Banking Group and those participations relevant for this sector were to remain at RZB. On 19 April 2010, the executive boards of the two institutions resolved to present a proposal on this merger to the shareholders for approval. At the general shareholders meeting on 7 July 2010, the shareholders of RZB voted to spin off the bank's commercial customer business and the related participations from RZB and to merge these with RI. The next day, the shareholders of RI approved this merger at a general shareholders meeting. The newly founded institution, Raiffeisen Bank International AG, began its activities on 11 October 2010. In 2016 Raiffeisen Banka d.d. of Slovenia (was renamed to KBS Banka, but merged with other bank to become Nova KBM) was sold to Apollo Global Management and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. On 18 March 2017 Raiffeisen Bank International merged with Raiffeisen Zentralbank Österreich; the merger was approved by the extraordinary general meeting of RBI's shareholders in January 2017. In mid-2017 the bank suspended the initial public offering of its subsidiary . Locations In 2015 Xiamen branch and the representatives office in Harbin, both in China, were closed down.

The Garter stall plates are visible affixed to the rear panelling of each stall Garter stall plates are small enamelled brass plates located in St George's Chapel displaying the names and arms of the Knights of the Garter. Each knight is allotted a stall in St George's Chapel and the stall plate is affixed to his personal stall. His successor knight in that stall adds his own stall plate and thus a fairly complete series of stall plates survives for the successive occupants of each stall. Many other ancient European Orders of Chivalry use similar stall plates in the home church or other building of their order. Significance Stall plates are important for several reasons: *They are works of art in their own right which demonstrate the skills of medieval and later metal workers and enamellers. *They are an extremely valuable source to students of heraldry, as they show contemporary images of ancient arms the provenance and reliability of which is second to none. Unlike the ancient seals which often survive, stall plates show not only the form of the arms but generally also the tinctures (colours). *They contain inscriptions which were used as evidence during legal disputes concerning devolution of peerage titles. However, as was demonstrated by J. Horace Round,Round, pp.174-5 the stall plates from about the mid-16th century frequently were inscribed with titles which were not legally held by the knight, but were merely ornate styles — frequently baronies which had never existed or were not theirs by right. The question addressed by Round was whether such styles inscribed on a Garter stall plate could form legal evidence in a court of law to prove that the knight had legally held the title recited on his stall plate. Before the 21st century and the curtailment of a peer's right to a seat in parliament, such issues were of great importance. An example of such a case was that of 1912 concerning the Barony of Furnivall. The appellant proposed in support of her claim that the stall plate of Henry, Duke of Norfolk (1655–1701), KG, nominated to the Order in 1685, was inscribed with the style of \\"Lord Furnivall\\". She herself was descended from the Duke. Similarly in 1692 Henry, Earl of Suffolk (1627–1709) had made a claim to the Barony of Howard de Walden based on the evidence from three Garter stall plates which purported to show that baronies by writ did not pass away with heirs general but were retained by the heir male, if he were an earl, with his earldom. This is known as the \\"Doctrine of Attraction\\", namely that an earldom attracts a barony. Regulation King Henry VIII (1509-1547) made a statute of the Order of the Garter relating to stall plates as follows:Round, p.174 > \\"It is agreed that every knyght within the yere of his stallation shall > cause to be made a scauchon of his armes and hachementis in a plate of > metall suche as shall please him and that it shall be surely sett upon the > back of his stall.

The Germans took the ship to port at Hampton Roads in Virginia in the United States where the Supreme Court of the United States decided who would get ownership of the vessel. History SS Appam at Hampton Roads flying a German flag Appam was built in 1913 by Harland & Wolff in Belfast, United Kingdom. She had a gross tonnage of 7,781 and was 425 feet long with a 37 foot beam. On 11 January 1916 the ship left Dakar in Senegal for Plymouth, United Kingdom, carrying 168 passengers and 133 crew members. Among the passengers were: Sir Francis Charles Fuller, the British Chief Commissioner to the Ashanti Region; and Sir Edward Merewether, the Governor of the Leeward Islands, and wife. By 15 January communication with the vessel stopped and the vessel was thought to have sunk when an empty lifeboat was spotted. In actuality, with World War I raging, the Imperial German Navy merchant raider captured Appam on 15 January 1916. The Germans put a prize crew aboard Appam, and, under German control as a prize, Appam separated from Möwe on 17 January and made her way to the United States, where she went into port at Hampton Roads, Virginia. The United States was a neutral country at the time, so Appam′s British owners filed suit in U.S. federal court to have Appam returned to them. On 29 July 1916, U.S. Federal Judge Edmund Waddill of Virginia directed that Appam, along with the cargo remaining aboard her and the proceeds of her perishable cargo that already had been sold, be returned at once to the ship′s British owners. The German Empire appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of the United States, which heard the case as The Steamship Appam, . On 6 March 1917, the Supreme Court found in favour of the British owners, handing down a decision that a belligerent nation may not bring prizes of war into a neutral port. On 28 March 1917, Appam was returned to her British owners and renamed SS Mandingo, before reverting to her original name at the end of the war.

The shop was located in a house in Banjica that was built and used by the CPY as a print shop from August 1, 1941 to August 31, 1944. The secret pressroom in the house was never discovered by the Nazis. In 1950, the house was turned into a memorial museum containing the material about all secret Partisan print shops in Belgrade. The museum was closed in August 2000. The house was declared a Cultural Monument of Exceptional Importance in 1979.  History  The Party started the building of the house on Banjički venac no. 12 prior to the bombing and occupation of Belgrade in April 1941, which halted the works until May. The house was finished by the end of July 1941. Svetozar Vukmanović organized men and plans for the construction, and provided new machines and materials for the pressroom. Through Branko Đonović, he provided two printing machines — one was large and worked on electric power, the other was smaller and worked on manual operation. These machines were bought in Zemun from a merchant and brought to the house. Since the building of the house was still not finished, the machines were hidden among the constructional material. Vukmanović also recruited people for work in the pressroom. He then decided to rent a house to a young couple with a maid, so that in the backyard two experienced graphic workers can work. His choices were M.D. Mile Bosković, Zagorka Jovanović and Ljubica Đonović. Bosković was his old acquaintance since his high school days in Cetinje. He was the member of the CPY, but unknown to the Belgrade police, because he studied abroad. Jovanović was a student of medicine in Kragujevac, she already worked in one secret pressroom before, and she was very reliable. Since Bosković was a bachelor, it was decided that him and Jovanović are to get married. This wedding solved the problem, Jovanović was well known to the police, so after the wedding she adopted new last name and changed her documents. Ljubica Đonović, the old acquaintance of Vukmanović and a member of CPY, got the part of the house maid and moved in the house afterwards. Choosing the workers for the pressroom, Vukmanović chose only the experts. He chose two workers for the pressroom, first one was graphic worker Branko Đonović, who also recommended the other worker, typographer Slobodan Jović. From the tenants of the house they formed a special cell which was directly connected to the Central committee of the CPY (CCCPY), whose secretary was Jovanović. After Vukmanović left, the care of illegal pressroom was taken over by Ivan Milutinović, member of the CCCPY. This pressroom was a secret not only for a police and Germans, but also for most members of the Party. The people that knew for the pressroom were Vukmanović, Milutinović, Đorđe Andrejević Kun, workers in the pressroom, owners of the house Branko and Dana Maksimović, as well as Josip Broz Tito and members of the Politburo of CCCPY. After Milutinović left the pressroom and went to the liberated territory in the middle of September 1941, Blagoje Nesković took over managing of the pressroom; he was a secretary of the Provincial Committee of CPY for Serbia. By the end of July 1941 the pressroom was moved in the house in Banjički venac. Andrejević Kun then made a special closet with the help of his father-in-law Mihajlo Ratković, that closet was hiding a secret entrance to the pressroom. After that, they isolated the pressroom with the boards, so that the noise from the machines could not be heard. Before they moved in, they solved another problem — electricity. The machine needed a three phase current, which they installed under the illusion that the doctor's office needed it. Since the machines used a large amount of electricity they had to remodel electric meter. Special room in which the pressroom was placed was equipped, besides the two printing machines, with two beds, maps of the current events on the front, radio, three guns and several bombs. The pressroom started to work August 1, 1941 by printing the first issue of the Bulletin of the HighCommand of NLA Detachments of Yugoslavia, which was brought in the pressroom by Milutinović.  Organization of work and life in the pressroom  In the house on Banjički venac there were special rules for living and working. Gate and the front door were always locked. Secret entrance to the pressroom was always open. During the work hours everybody was in the pressroom except one tenant who was on duty upstairs. Branko Đonović and Jović slept in the room which led directly to the pressroom. In the case of emergency they had to climb down the ladder in the secret room. They had no visitors except Branko and Dana Maksimović, whom lived nearby, in the house of Branko's father. For delivering printing materials, Jovanović was in charge. She met every day in the agreed time and place with Milorad Rajter and exchanges the material. During this job Jovanović used a different ID so that the police, in the case of her arrest could not find the pressroom. Later, Ljubica Đonović joined Jovanović in this job but they worked separately. In time, as the repression grew, the action of exchanging materials took more and more people involved. First, Branko Maksimović joined them, and then Branko Đonović and Jović, armed with fake IDs, followed. All the police attempts to find the secret pressroom failed and it continue to work regularly. Distribution of the material from the house in Banjički venac was taking place in the apartment in Lastina street no. 9, where the central expeditionary station was located. That apartment was owned by civil servant Miroslav Parezanović and his wife Olga. From there materials were taken by the technicians of the Provincial Committee, Slavka Morić and Srbijanka Bukumirović, who delivered it to couriers of the committee and to the headquarters of the Partisan squad. Part of party material was distributed in Belgrade, and part was sent all over occupied Yugoslavia. Secret work of the pressroom gave top results. It was organized so that the people who worked in the pressroom and those who took over the material did not know each other. Also, the people who expedited the material did not know where the pressroom was located. Because of that the pressroom stayed undetected and survived two large police interventions into Partisans' organization. In fall 1941 and spring 1942, because all of the police activities, the work in the pressroom was in stagnation, but it remained undetected. Police put in a lot of effort to discover it. They checked all the technique in all public pressrooms in the city, and since they could not find anything, they figured out that the pressroom was somewhere in the heartland. One event that showed the police that the pressroom was, in fact, in Belgrade was on 7 November 1942. In the streets of Belgrade, flyers were distributed with a report on the speech which Sergei Molotov delivered in Moscow on 6 November. This speech was broadcast through Radio Moscow around 7 pm. The flyers were all over Belgrade by 9 pm. By August 1943, the pressroom printed five issues of the Bulletin of the High Command, seven issues of Glas, Proleter for 1942, declarations of the Provincial Committee of CPY of 1 July 1942, 7 September 1942, March 1943 and 1 May 1943, four Circular issues of the Provincial Committee, declaration of the CK SKOJ of 7 November 1942, different books, flyers, radio news and other materials.  Departure of Bosković  By the end of December 1941 Gestapo began the purge of the Belgrade University. Since Bosković kept reserved and did not declare himself about the National Liberation War, Gestapo decided him of freemasonry. Especially suspicious was the fact that he studied abroad, so he was tagged as English spy. In the night of 5/6 January 1942 German police came to the house to look for Bosković. He was hiding in the secret pressroom, along with Branko Đonović and Jović. Jovanović and Ljubica Đonović explained the police that Bosković went to visit his cousin outside the city. Police then searched the house, but found nothing suspicious. Before they left, they told Jovanović that Bosković must immediately report to Gestapo, the moment he returns. Week later another German patrol came by the house and brought a new invitation for Bosković to report to Gestapo. Party organization than made a decision that Bosković is no longer legal tenant of the house, so he joined Branko Đonović and Jović in there hiding in the pressroom. At the end of January 1942 Andrejević Kun came to the pressroom. In that time he lived in administrative colony under the fake name Antonović, but that alias became unsure so he moved to the house in Banjički venac. Since Kun was to stay in occupied Belgrade, he had to hide in the pressroom until a safe place for him is found. During that time he was working on making fake IDs. He made fake documents on the name Vinko Tomasević for Bosković, who went to Zagreb at the beginning of July 1942. There, he connected with Ivanka Mucević Nikolas with whom he was supposed to cross to the liberated territory and go to Tito's Supreme headquarters. Since they lost their connection, Nikolas and Bosković were spotted by the police in one of their walks in occupied Zagreb. One policeman recognized Nikolas and arrested her along with Bosković. That was the first time that the police captured somebody from the secret pressroom. Bosković revealed nothing, so he was transferred to the Stara Gradiška concentration camp where he was murdered in September 1944.  Germans moving in the house  After finding that doctor Bosković was arrested in Zagreb, members of the secret pressroom decided that they are not going to keep the house rented on his name, because of the fear that the police may find out about his arrest. Jovanović and Ljubica Đonović reported to the police that they are moving to their cousins to countryside. They both remained in the house as illegal tenants. Branko and Dana Maksimović then returned as legal tenants. Secret life in the house became extremely hard, in the afternoon while Maksimovićs were at work, other tenants could not make a sound, and during the winter because of the smoke they could not build a fire to worm. During his travels to Macedonia, where he was sent by Supreme headquarters, Svetozar Vukmanović visited Belgrade from December 1942 until January 1943. After year and a half he came back to the pressroom. At the beginning of the May 1942 a large number of significant members of Partisans from Belgrade, went to the liberated territory in Bosnia, where the Supreme headquarters of the Partisans were located. In that group were Đorđe Andrejević Kun, Vladislav and Jara Ribnikar, Slavka Morić, Milada Rajter, Brana Petrović and others to whom Jovanović and Ljubica Đonović joined. Work of the pressroom continued until August 31, 1943 when the Germans ordered that all tenants must leave the house in three days, so that their officers could move in. They also ordered that all the furniture must stay in the house. Since the deadline for the moving of the pressroom was so short, and party organization in Belgrade in that time was in troubles, Branko Đonović and Jović had to organize moving of the pressroom themselves. By the instructions of the Provincial Committee, they moved smaller printing machine to the secret shelter in the apartment of Milutin Blagojević in Krajinska street number 24. Because of the fear that the Germans might find the secret printroom, the Provincial Committee advised Maksimovićs to go illegal, and soon in October they crossed to liberated territory in Srem. German officers, whom from September 1943 to October 1944, lived in the house in Banjički venac 12, never noticed that on the bottom of the closet was a hidden entrance to the secret pressroom.  Museum  House on Banjički venac 12 was made into the Museum of Secret Party pressrooms on 1 May 1950, which was a section of the Museum of Belgrade. Exhibition represented the work of secret pressrooms that worked on the territory of occupied Belgrade. A memorial plaque was placed on the house and it was declared a Cultural Monument of Exceptional Importance in 1979. Museum was closed for the visitors August 2000 and house was return to the successors of Branko and Dana Maksimović, after the litigation with the city of Belgrade.  In popular culture  Work of the secret pressroom was described in many books which deal with World War II in Belgrade, and especially good description was given by Dragan Marković in his book Otpisani (The Written Off). During the filming of the TV series Otpisani in 1974, screenwriters Dragan Marković and Siniša Pavić dedicated an episode under the name Pressroom. In the series, the things have been changed a little so that the events in the pressroom happen faster than they did in reality. The names of the characters in series were also changed, so instead of Bosković and student Jovanović appears doctor Janković (Zoran Milosavljević) and Olivera (Svetlana Bojković), instead of house keeper Ljubica appears Ivana (Ljubica Ković) who was shown as a middle aged woman, graphic workers Zareta (Đorđe Jelisić) and Nenad (Josif Tatić) also don’t have many similarities with Branko Đonović and Slobodan Jović, while the character Milan (Mirko Bulović) is the closest to the actual Milutin Blagojević, owner of the house where the other pressroom was located.

It is the apex advisory body of the Government of Nepal for formulating a national vision, periodic plans and policies for development. It is headed by the Right Honorable Prime Minister. The NPC assesses resource needs, identifies sources of funding, and allocates budget for socio-economic development. It serves as a central agency for monitoring and evaluating development plans, policies and programs. The NPC also serves as an intellectual hub for the exchange of new development ideas and proposals from scholars, private sector, civil society, and development partners.  History  The Planning Commission was first created in Nepal in 1956. It was soon renamed in accordance with the Yojana Mandal Act of 1957. Following the introduction of the partyless Panchayat system in 1961, the National Planning Council was formed under the then king. In 1963, the Council was dissolved and a new planning body, with an identical name, was constituted under the Chairman of the Council of Ministers. All the Ministers became ex-officio members of the Council; and the Ministry of Economic Affairs was renamed the Ministry of Economic Planning. In 1968, all tasks related to development budget and foreign aid hitherto carried out by the Ministry of Economic Planning were assigned to the Ministry of Finance. The National Planning Council then morphed into the National Planning Commission (NPC) under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister. A 1972 study on the functions and responsibilities of the central planning agency resulted in the reconstitution of the NPC. After the historic restoration of multiparty democracy in 1990, the newly elected government reconstituted the NPC again with the Prime Minister as Chair, a full-time Vice-Chairman, five Members, and a Member-Secretary. The current organization and functions of the NPC draw on the Executive Order issued by the cabinet in 2010.

His shop in the booksellers' district of St Paul's Churchyard was at the Sign of the Gun, where he sold many anonymous works as well as works by Thomas Kyd, Robert Greene, Anthony Munday and Christopher Marlowe. Between 1594 and 1611 he sold all three quartos of William Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus. Family Edward White, born about 1548, was the son of a Suffolk mercer, John White of Bury St Edmunds. His mother's name is unknown. Career White began his printing career in 1565 as apprentice to William Lobley. By 1576 he was sufficiently established to take on his brother, Andrew White, as his own apprentice. In succeeding years he is known to have had eleven other apprentices. He entered his first copy in the Stationers' Register on 21 July 1577, The true history and faithful relation of a most horrible murder committed by Alphonse Diazius. On 7 April 1579 he entered Thomas Salter's The mirror of modesty, and dedicated it to his wife's step-mother, Lady Anne Lodge. Lady Lodge lived only a few months longer; on 29 December 1579 White was the first stationer to enter a work by his brother-in-law, Thomas Lodge, An Epitaph of the Lady Anne Lodge, of which no copy now survives. He was admitted to the livery of the Stationers' Company in June 1588. Although he never attained the office of Master of the Company, he served as under warden in 1600, and as senior warden in 1606. White's output included a great deal of popular literature. He either licensed, printed or sold some twenty plays, as well as three dozen ballads, and almost the same number of pamphlets. White died late in 1612 or early in 1613; his last entry in the Stationers' Register bears the date 12 August 1612. His widow survived him, and with their son took over the family printing business until her own death about 1615. Among works licensed to White's son were Sir John Fitz's Ghost (13 September 1605), A new ballad of the late commotion in Herefordshire occasioned by the death of Alice Wellington, a recusant (13 September 1605), and England's joy, or the happy nuptials of Prince Frederick and the Lady Elizabeth (20 February 1613). In 1619 John Grismand partly took over the business, perhaps, Bishai suggests, because White's son was a less successful businessman than his father.

Lumbini is the traditional birthplace of Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, who was born in the 7th or 6th century BC.According to Buddhist tradition, Maya Devi (or Mayadevi) gave birth to the Buddha on her way to her parents’ home in Devadaha in the month of May in the year 623 BC. Feeling the onset of labor pains, she grabbed hold of the branches of a shade tree and gave birth to Siddharta Gautama, the future Buddha. The Buddha is said to have announced, \\"This is my final rebirth\\" as he entered the world. Buddhist tradition also has it that he walked immediately after his birth and took seven steps, under each of which a lotus flower bloomed. In 249 BC, the Buddhist convert Emperor Ashoka visited Lumbini and constructed four stupas and a stone pillar. Ashoka's Pillar bears an inscription that translates as: \\"King Piyadasi (Ashoka), beloved of devas, in the 20 year of the coronation, himself made a royal visit, Buddha Sakyamuni having been born here, a stone railing was built and a stone pillar erected to the Bhagavan [\\"blessed one\\"] having been born here.

Master plan The United Nations Development Programme contributed nearly one million dollars for preparation of a Master Plan for the development of Lumbini, including numerous engineering and archaeological studies. The plan, which was completed in 1978, has as its objective to restore an area of about 7.7 km2, to be known as the Lumbini Garden, centering on the garden and the Ashoka Pillar, with an additional area of 64.5 km2 to be developed in its support.

The work A Case of Conscience (1592) of William Perkins is considered foundational for the genre. So-called \\"case divinity\\" has been described as fundamental to Puritan culture. The underlying theological trend is said to be visible in George Gifford: evidence from life accentuated as \\"proof of election\\", to be obtained reflectively, and matching \\"biblically promised effects\\". In line with the tenets of Reformed theology, the assurance of salvation could produce dilemmas on a spiritual level, and Puritan casuistry in part was a response to the need to address these issues as practical problems. Perkins, Richard Greenham, William Ames and Joseph Alleine were noted as authors who wrote in this area. From Ames, it was considered that reprobation can almost never know itself. More accurately, the issue is election, and the assurance of it, and Perkins addressed it as a preoccupation. Otherwise, the content of \\"Puritan casuistry\\" is still somewhat contested by scholars, because the element of casuistry is apparently lower than would be expected, if it were simply the casuistry of Puritanism. One explanation lies in a transformed, Protestant, meaning of \\"casuistry\\", as the \\"sifting of the conscience\\". Some of the content of confession is therefore implied, and so of devotional life. In terms of genre, devotional literature can be closer to the mark, than moral literature. It has been argued by a Jesuit author that \\"casuistry\\" here is a misnomer, and \\"practical divinity\\" more accurate. Background in Early Modern casuistry The medieval tradition in casuistry went under the name casus conscientiae, \\"cases of conscience\\". It took the form of moral principles shown as applied to particular situations. It was taken up by 17th century writers, both Catholic and Protestant. When Reformed theologians adopted casuistry, it was in a distinctive style: concise and biblical, and largely denying the separation of moral philosophy from theology. In the early 17th century the term \\"practical theology\\" was coming in, to cover \\"cases of conscience\\", though its scope could be wider than that.

It is an account of women who have contributed to the sciences, up to the time when it was published. Themes The comprehensive theme that is depicted throughout Woman in Science is that of women's biological capacity. It is asserted that women being less prominent than men in science is due to the lack of educational and career opportunities available rather than, the biological aspects of brain size or structure. In addition, the book encompasses the many developments of science throughout history. The main objective of the author/book was for women to become more involved and gain a respected position in the scientific field, in addition to increasing educational and career opportunities for women interested in science.

In addition to archaeogenetics, he has published on the reconstruction and spread of prehistoric languages and in the field of forensic genetics.  Biography  Peter Forster studied chemistry at the Christian-Albrechts-University in Kiel and the University of Hamburg. At the Heinrich-Pette-Institut for Virology and Immunology in Hamburg, he specialised in genetics and obtained his PhD degree in 1997 in biology on the topic of \\"Dispersal and differentiation of modern Homo sapiens analysed with mitochondrial DNA\\". After postdoctoral research at the Institute for Legal Medicine at the Westphalian Wilhelms-University in Münster, he was appointed Research Fellow at the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research in Cambridge University in 1999, and furthermore a Fellow at Murray Edwards College at the University of Cambridge. He is on the editorial board of the International Journal of Legal Medicine, and a director of Roots for Real. Peter Forster was elected a life member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. In January 2016 the Royal Society of Biology elected Peter Forster as a Fellow.  Human Origins  Modern humans have existed in Africa for around 200,000 years. Peter Forster discovered on the basis of modern and ancient DNA that there has only been a single successful migration out of Africa during prehistory, and he dated this emigration to around 60,000 years ago. The size of this emigrant group, according to his estimate, was less than 200 people (BBC 2009: African tribe populated rest of the world). Their descendants travelled on average about 200 to 1,000 metres per year and reached Europe and Australia just over 40,000 years ago, and America around 20,000 years ago. Due to the small numbers of founders, and due to their subsequent isolation on separate continents, differences between populations accumulated, yielding the distinctive sets of features that are perceived today as human races.Forster P: Ice Ages and the mitochondrial DNA chronology of human dispersals: a review., Phil Trans R Soc Lond B 359:255-264, 2004 On the basis of geographic DNA patterns, Forster discovered that the current language areas on all continents arose primarily through the prehistoric spread of culturally or militarily dominant men, whose languages were evidently favoured by the local women and passed on to their children. Hence, there is a statistical relationship today between the language and the Y chromosome types of modern males, but no such relationship between mtDNA and language in females today.Forster P, Renfrew C: Mother Tongue and Y Chromosomes. Science 333:1390-1391, 2011 Peter Forster has also applied his statistical evolutionary approach on languages directly and has calculated that the Celtic languages spread in the Bronze Age from about 3000 BC, and that the Germanic languages spread during the Iron Age from about 600 BC, as far as Britain.Forster P, Renfrew C: Forster P, Renfrew C: „Phylogenetic Methods and the Prehistory of Languages. McDonald Institute Press, University of Cambridge, 2006. To obtain these results, Forster has compiled, proofread and corrected DNA- and language databases, and developed, in collaboration with his colleagues, phylogenetic network analysis of mitochondrial DNA, Y-chromosomal DNA, and linguistic data, as well as the concept of the mtDNA- and Y-chromosomal \\"clock\\". He has developed practical applications of his research in the shape of DNA ancestry tests, geographical ancestry tests and relationship tests for casework in genealogy, family research and forensics.

The chamber was found to be about 2.8 metres by 1.2 metres, and its area was defined by a spread of charcoal with a hearth at the eastern end, where there was thought to have been a second chamber or passage. The finds included five flint flakes, a burnt flint arrowhead, a small chip from a polished flint axe, and nine small fragments of pottery. Phillips believed that the pottery fragments were from the Beaker culture, and thus might represent Bronze Age reuse of an earlier Neolithic monument.

Martinez, 538 U.S. 760 (2003), was a decision of the United States Supreme Court, which held that a police officerated in certain egregious circumstances and remanded the case to the lower court to decide this issue on the case's facts. A complex series of concurrences and dissents were filed, many partially joined by various justices. Justice Thomas announced the judgment of the court, finding that no constitutional rights were violated. However, the only opinion to gain the votes of a majority of the court was Part II of Souter's concurrence, which consisted of a direction to the lower court to consider the substantive due process claims on remand.  Background  In 1997, during an altercation with the police in Oxnard, California, the respondent Martinez was shot five times. He was very seriously injured. The police officer's supervisor—the petitioner, Chavez—arrived at the scene around the same time as the paramedics. He rode in the ambulance with Martinez and accompanied him into the hospital. Throughout this time, Martinez was often conscious but in great distress, repeatedly stating that he was dying and requesting treatment. Without informing Martinez of his Miranda rights, Chavez sporadically interviewed Martinez about the incident over a period of 45 minutes. Martinez survived the incident, but was partially paralyzed and left blind.\\"permanently blinded and paralyzed from the waist down\\" Chavez v.

Martinez, 538 U.S. 760, 764 (2003) Martinez sued Chavez in a §1983 action alleging that his constitutional rights had been violated. The district court found that Chavez had violated at least two of Martinez's clearly established rights: the 5th Amendment right not to be compelled to be a witness against himself and his 14th Amendment right not to be subjected to coercive questioning. Because of this violation, the district court held that Chavez was not entitled to qualified immunity. The 9th Circuit affirmed this ruling. The Supreme Court then granted certiorari.  Opinion  Justice Thomas announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion. = Fifth Amendment =  Thomas opinion  > The Fifth Amendment requires that “[n]o person ... shall be compelled in any > criminal case to be a witness against himself.” We fail to see how, based on > the text of the Fifth Amendment, Martinez can allege a violation of this > right, since Martinez was never prosecuted for a crime, let alone compelled > to be a witness against himself in a criminal case.Chavez v.

Forte was created specifically for season eight of America's Got Talent (AGT) in 2013. After weeks of preparation online, the three original members met in person just two days before their first performance together; afterward, the show's rules forced the group to make a personnel change. The new lineup advanced to the final round in September, where Forte finished in fourth place. Following their elimination, the men accepted a recording contract offered by representatives of Columbia Records, who were waiting for them in the hallway offstage. Forte has since performed at Carnegie Hall and the White House, and has been the featured guest at numerous charity galas. The group was the first finalist from season eight to headline a show in Las Vegas. Their eponymous debut album, released in November 2013, peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard Classical Albums chart. Forte's second album, The Future Classics, presents their operatic take on contemporary popular songs and features an original piece using the theme music composed for Game of Thrones. History =Background= Josh Page of Suffern, New York, won the \\"David Foster and Friends\\" competition in 2009. When Page was pulled from the audience at a 2011 Josh Groban concert to sing a duet with Groban, the resulting video went viral. Sean Panikkar was born and raised in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, the second son of Sri Lankan immigrants.Croan. Panikkar's parents and older brother were born in Sri Lanka. He is an established opera performer, and has sung for such opera companies as the Pittsburgh Opera and the Metropolitan Opera, and at such venues as La Scala. Hana Ryu studied at the Korea National University of Arts in Seoul, South Korea. He came to the United States on a student visa, choosing in 2012 to pursue a Master of Music degree at Binghamton University. Recurring member Fernando Varela was born in Puerto Rico and raised in central Florida. Like Page, Varela won a David Foster competition, \\"Born to Sing\\", in 2011. =Formation: America's Got Talent= In 2013, founding members Page and Varela met online, where Varela saw the YouTube video of Page with Groban. Page suggested that they form \\"a new kind of tenor group\\" to compete on America's Got Talent (AGT). They found Ryu during an online search, and spent the next few weeks preparing for their audition in Los Angeles, which came just two days after the three met in person for the first time. Forte's performance of \\"Pie Jesu\\" won praise from the judges; Howard Stern said they had the element of surprise because they looked like schlubs, but next time \\"we're going to know that you're not schlubs, but you're fantastic singers\\". Howie Mandel said the trio was like the premise to a joke: a Latino, a Korean and a New Yorker \\"walk into a bar, and record a giant hit record. You guys are phenomenal.\\" Before the group could perform again, AGT producers learned about Ryu's visa status; he was in the United States legally, but the show's rules rendered him ineligible to compete for the winning prize. Page and Varela found Panikkar in time for their next performance in Las Vegas,Fortuna. \\"Hana was the only opera singer [and] Josh felt that having a true operatic tenor was a key element of the group,\\" Panikkar explained; his wife convinced him to take advantage of \\"the kind of exposure that opera singers, and opera in general, never receive.\\" where they were sent directly to sing in front of the show's producers. Varela called it a stressful week, during which the new trio had to learn how to work together, and on a song Panikkar didn't know. When the men faced the judges, Mel B asked them to explain the personnel change, and said it was like a second audition. After Forte sang \\"The Prayer\\", Stern said to the other judges, \\"the new guy is the strongest singer.\\" The re-formed group continued to advance in the competition; in the rounds to follow, Forte performed such songs as \\"Somewhere\\", \\"Unchained Melody\\" and \\"Caruso\\" to audience ovations and judges' praise, After their finale performance of \\"Caruso\\", Mel B said, \\"it's funny to think that you three came together and performed first on this show. You would never know that—it's like you're professionals, and you've been together forever.\\"}} and an eventual fourth-place finish. Though the men later expressed disappointment with the outcome, Panikkar said they never expected to win the competition. Career =2013–2014: FORTE and concert appearances= Following Forte's elimination from America's Got Talent, representatives of Columbia Records \\"literally stopped us in the hallway as we were leaving the stage\\", and Panikkar, Page and Varela signed on. Their self- titled CD was recorded within the next seven days and released in November 2013; FORTE spent two weeks on the Billboard 200 chart, peaking at No. 76. The album reached No. 3 on the Billboard Classical Albums chart, and debuted at No. 2 on Amazon.com's best sellers list and No. 1 at Barnes & Noble. Forte's live performances in 2013 included the Music of Hope concert at Carnegie Hall, where their fans raised more than US$3,000 for the Golden Hat Foundation, and the National Christmas Tree lighting ceremony at the White House. Forte was the first act from season eight of AGT to headline a show in Las Vegas, performing at the Tropicana for three nights in December. In March 2014, Forte was the closing act for the 8th annual Festival of the Arts Boca in Boca Raton, Florida, where they performed to multiple standing ovations. Palm Beach ArtsPaper said the men were coaxed back onto the stage for two encores, the second coming after \\"the thunderous applause refused to die down.\\" In April, the trio was the featured act at the Central City Opera Theater of Dreams Gala in Denver, Colorado, and followed that with a performance at the Fort Worth Opera Festival. FORTE (l-r: Ryu, Page, Panikkar) frame the ocean off Sands Point, New York, in the music video for their single \\"Game of Thrones\\" (2015). =2015–present: Ryu's return and The Future Classics= Fernando Varela returned to Florida in mid-2014 to embark on a solo tour, while performing as part of Forte into December. Original member Hana Ryu succeeded Varela in 2015; Page, Panikkar and Ryu began work on their second album, The Future Classics, which was funded by a crowdsourcing campaign though PledgeMusic. The album was conceived as Forte's spin on popular music, including such songs as \\"Burn\\", \\"Collide\\" and \\"Free Fallin'\\". Producer Zach Page said the idea came after FORTE was marketed as an adult contemporary-style album, which the men believed was the wrong approach. Instead, the \\"production muscle\\" of the follow-up album was intended to captivate listeners as Forte had done with their performances on AGT. The Future Classics was self-released digitally on February 2, 2016, to those who had taken part in the campaign; CDs were shipped on April 11. The first single, \\"Game of Thrones\\", was inspired by the soundtrack for the HBO series, which Josh Page called \\"the perfect subject matter to justify an epic opera performance.\\" Since its theme had no lyrics, Page adapted High Valyrian text from Game of Thrones and set it to the music composed by Ramin Djawadi. The video for the single was shot over two days' time at Sands Point on Long Island, and self-released by Forte in February 2015.\\"Game of Thrones\\". A1. (Forte). 2015. It was a top-five hit on YouTube's \\"Just-Released Music Videos\\" list in March. When the video was shared by the official Game of Thrones Twitter account, Page said, \\"it knocked the air out of me.\\" In concert in August 2015, Forte joined David Foster, Nathan Gunn and America's Got Talent season 9 runner-up Emily West at the 11th Annual Charles Evans PCF Pro-Am Tennis Tournament Gala in Southampton, New York. Forte was the headline act on September 28 at the Bloomsburg Fair. The group joined Foster for three charity events in October: the Carousel Ball in Denver, Colorado; the Global Lyme Alliance Gala in New York City; and the Tradition of Hope Gala in Los Angeles. Also in October, they gave three performances for the Hope On the Hill Gala at the Van Andel Institute. In December, Forte joined Gunn, Isabel Leonard and John Fogerty in performance at the MLB Prostate Cancer Foundation 2015 New York Dinner in New York City. Forte headlined a benefit for Catholic Charities of Buffalo in June 2016 at Kleinhans Music Hall. Their first appearance in 2017 was at Tydings Auditorium in New Mexico in February. In March, Forte joined Broadway and Hollywood artists including Liz Callaway, Annie Golden, Telly Leung and Chris Mann to cover \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", a single and video to benefit Americans for the Arts. Forte released a video cover of the Daredevil theme in October. Forte joined the NAMM Show in January 2018, headlining the show's Grand Rally for Music Education. For this performance, the trio comprised Page, Alok Kumar and Victor Ryan Robertson. In May, Forte joined season six America's Got Talent winner Landau Eugene Murphy Jr. to headline Opera Grand Rapids' 50th Anniversary Night with the Opera Gala. Founding member Fernando Varela joined Page and Panikkar for this appearance, and Varela also performed with Forte in February 2019 at the Sharon L. Morse Performing Arts Center. Critical reception =Genre= OperaPulse listed its Top Ten Best Things to Happen to Opera In the 21st Century, and the collaboration between Broadway, pop culture and prime-time television ranked No. 2. The Got Talent franchise, and specifically contestants Forte and Paul Potts, were singled out for helping the operatic genre redefine itself. =Releases= AllMusic called FORTE \\"close-up, clear, and full of presence, so the artists' individual qualities are easily distinguished.\\" The Las Vegas Review-Journal called it \\"basically a 'greatest hits' of 'popera. MTV News said Forte's \\"Game of Thrones\\" video is \\"an incredible homage to the series\\" that gave them chills. Revision3 named it an editor's pick for Forte's \\"glorious voices, and swords forged only of the finest Valyrian steel.\\" Classic FM awarded \\"most epic cover\\" status to \\"a magnificently camp video in which the three tenors run around in fancy dress, and indulge boyhood fantasies of being master swordsmen.\\" =Performances= \\"Forte riveted the audience with phenomenal performances\\" at Carnegie Hall in 2013, wrote MasterClass Lady. The group's 2014 appearance in Fort Worth, Texas, received a mixed review from TheaterJones: since only Panikkar is \\"truly an opera singer\\", the three voices blending was \\"sometimes compelling, sometimes problematic. ...

Today it is a major component of the University Hospitals of Strasbourg, a teaching hospital that is the biggest employer in Alsace, with over 11,000 employees, ranking fourth in France in terms of quality. History Porte de l'hôpital (1340) Chapelle Ehrhard (1428) Pharmacy (1537) Close-up of main historical building (1725) =The first hospital= According to the 1143 charter of Bishop , preserved in the municipal archives of the city of Strasbourg, the hospital was founded in the year 1119, although another source refers to a hospital in 1105. The first building was located close to the cathedral, in the street that now bears its name (rue du vieil hôpital). A religious brotherhood, probably Augustinian, took care of the sick and destitute. Being a religious establishment, with a mission to care for the needy, the hospital turned nobody away. The Great Interregnum of the Holy Roman Empire, from 1254 to 1273, was a period of great instability in Alsace. The hospital gave asylum to a large influx of refugees from the countryside, where feuding lords burnt a number of villages. =The second hospital= During the 14th century, the population of Strasbourg was decimated by famine and by the plague. It was decided to move the hospital outside of the city walls. A new hospital was constructed just outside the city gate that became known as the \\"Porte de l'Hôpital\\". The hospital was devastated by fire on 6 November 1716, apparently started by a washerwoman with a candle. It was largely rebuilt between 1717 and 1725. =The third hospital= Two new buildings were opened in the hospital grounds in 2008, which together are known as the \\"Nouvel Hôpital civil\\", covering 90,000 square metres. The inauguration, in the presence of the French Nicolas Sarkozy, took place on 6 January 2009. The new blocks include 715 beds. The equipment includes a Da Vinci robotic surgical system. The Porte de l'hôpital The Strasbourg city walls of 1340 included seven gates. Of these only one remains, the Porte de l'hôpital or Spitaltor, including a 14th-century external fresco. This city gate is located at the entrance of the old hospital, next to the Erhard Chapel. It was classified a monument historique in 1929. Chapelle Erhard The Protestant Chapel at the hospital entrance, dedicated to St Erhard, was built in 1428. The wine cellars The wine cellars, which date from 1395, are a tourist attraction in their own right. Over the centuries, many patients paid for their care by leaving parcels of land that have grown to constitute a vast area of vineyards. The 1716 fire that destroyed most of the hospital, spared the wine cellars. The cellars produce some 150,000 bottles a year of Gewürztraminer, Muscat, Riesling and Pinot Gris. The historic cellar is renowned for the quality of its wines but does no advertising and reinvests all its profits in the purchase of medical equipment. In the 18th century, the Hospital of Strasbourg was the largest Domaine in Alsace, making and selling wine as a side business. Patients were given two litres of wine a day.

In such a system all jobs start service immediately (there is no queueing). The processor sharing algorithm \\"emerged as an idealisation of round-robin scheduling algorithms in time-shared computer systems\\". Queueing theory A single server queue operating subject to Poisson arrivals (such as an M/M/1 queue or M/G/1 queue) with a processor sharing discipline has a geometric stationary distribution. The sojourn time jobs experience has no closed form solution, even in an M/M/1 queue. Generalized processor sharing Generalized processor sharing is a multi-class adaptation of the policy which shares service capacity according to positive weight factors to all non-empty job classes at the node, irrespective of the number of jobs of each class present. Often it is assumed that the jobs within a class form a queue and that queue is served on a first- come, first-served basis, but this assumption is not necessary for many GPS applications. In processor scheduling, generalized processor sharing is \\"an idealized scheduling algorithm that achieves perfect fairness. All practical schedulers approximate GPS and use it as a reference to measure fairness.\\" Multilevel processor sharing In multilevel processor sharing a finite set of thresholds are defined and jobs partitioned according to how much service they have received. The lowest level (containing jobs which have received the least service) has the highest priority and higher levels monotonically decreasing priorities. Within each level an internal discipline is used.

Three members of the group, including those identified as Joseph Lavell Parker (son of Hollywood actor Anthony Ray Parker) and Beraiah Hales, after an 18 month investigation by detectives from across the country the investigation ended with no charges being laid due to lack of evidence. The case has drawn reactions from the then Prime Minister (John Key), the Police Commissioner (Peter Marshall), the Minister of Police (Anne Tolley), several prominent media personalities in New Zealand, and the New Zealand public. Investigation The story initially broke due to reporting by 3 News (now Newshub) on 6 November 2013. Police spokesmen claimed they had been aware of the group and had been monitoring their Facebook page for two years, but had not begun prosecution because no alleged victims had made formal statements or complaints. However, it was later reported that at least two alleged victims had gone to the police in 2011. One of the alleged victims made a formal complaint in 2011 when she was thirteen years old, and was quoted as saying the police \\"said that I didn't have enough evidence to show, because I went out in clothes that was pretty much asking for it. [...] I was asked a lot of questions about what I was wearing, and I went out in a skirt.\\" She stated she was also asked to re-enact her sexual assault with dolls. In that same month the media reported that several girls who alleged they were raped by the group made complaints to the police at least as early as 2011, despite initial claims that no such complaints had been filed: four girls had come forward in 2011 and 2012. The police continually stated there was insufficient evidence to prosecute, although they claimed they had warned members of the group to cease their activities. That same months one of the alleged victims made a second official complaint after claiming the police failed to act on her initial complaint two years before. Police Commissioner Peter Marshall initially defended the police's treatment of the alleged victims and its handling of the case, but later acknowledged that the police misled the public on the details of the case and could have done a better job dealing with the investigation. Police Minister Anne Tolley has since asked the Independent Police Conduct Authority (IPCA) to review how the case was handled, citing concerns of police mishandling. On 11 December 2013, speaking at a parliamentary select committee in Wellington, Police Commissioner Peter Marshal admitted police failings over the handling of the case, acknowledging that the investigation and response \\"should have been sharper.\\" On 12 November 2013 the police appointed \\"a woman detective with significant experience in child sexual abuse cases to head the newly named Operation Clover\\", who was to lead a multi-agency probe into the case. The investigating team has asked possible victims and others who may have information into the group to come forward by calling a dedicated phone-line. The mother of an alleged victim stated that the school which the young men and some of the alleged victims attended did nothing in response to complaints. In a statement to the press the principal claimed \\"she was aware of an incident at an out-of-school party which she was told about it in April 2012\\", and that the school at the time cooperated with police, but the alleged victim claimed she was bullied by one of the young men on school grounds. Some friends of the group have since claimed the boasts are exaggerated and the group did not specifically target under-age girls. Friends of the group also claimed the behaviour of the young men was nothing more than normal teen antics. Despite official police complaints having been laid as early as 2011, several friends of the group have claimed that other girls did indeed give consent: in New Zealand it is an offence to have sexual contact with a person under the age of 16, and one alleged victim was 13 years old when she made an official complaint in December 2011. The IPCA reported in March 2015 that the original 2011 police investigation had serious problems and basic police work on the matter was inadequate. The police decided that prosecutions would be inappropriate but the IPCA said the legal threshold for prosecution had been met, for example on charges of sexual activity with a person under the age of consent. Police officials admitted that the police work was of unacceptable standard and apologised to the women involved and their families.. Police spoke with more than 100 girls as part of the Operation Clover reinvestigation in 2013. The outcome was announced in 2014 following a 12 month review of the case. Media attention The Roast Busters group and the alleged lack of police action came to prominent media attention in early November 2013 and sparked a national debate and attracted international attention. On 16 November 2013 numerous protests were held across New Zealand's major cities in response to the group as well as police and media handling of the case. Protesters sought to speak out against rape culture, the police mishandling of the case, victim blaming, and inadequate funding for rape crisis centres and educational programmes set up focusing on consent, and rape prevention and awareness. The matter has also featured heavily on talk back radio and political blogs, where the handling of the subject by some commentators sparked outrage, subsequently resulting in advertising boycotts and presenters being taken off air due to comments felt to be victim blaming. When speaking with an 18-year-old friend of an alleged victim of the group, who had launched rape complaints, the hosts referred to the group's actions as \\"mischief.\\" Some felt the hosts implied that the alleged victims of gang rape were culpable when the hosts claimed that young girls \\"should not be drinking anyway.\\" On 21 November 2013 a petition signed by over 111,000 people demanding stronger action over the Roast Busters scandal was handed over to the New Zealand Parliament. The petition also demanded better police support for victims of sexual assault and asked that the government to no longer strip back funding to sexual violence services. In January 2019, an interview conducted with Joseph Lavell Parker by Newshub was heavily criticised for reportedly re-traumatising the victims of the group's attacks, who had launched rape complaints against him. The ringleader, Joseph Lavell Parker, described his place in the gang, as being an artist, saying \\"When you talk about the Roast Busters that is why I started Roast Busting. Why I even was a Roast Buster, to me it was a form of performing, it was an avenue of performing. It was kind of like a performance act in a lot of ways. You got treated like a performer, celebrated like a performer, celebrated like peers you get a lot of fruits that performers get, like is like...access to all types of...of all types of sinful treats [laughs] which is what I was indulging myself in... That is what drew me to pursuing the Roast Busters as hard as I pursued it.\\"Roast Busters' victims shocked by Joseph Parker's comments Catrin Owen, Jan 22 2019, Stuff New Zealand Name The name of the group Roast Busters is assumed to be derived from the term \\"Spit roast\\", a euphemism for a sexual practice involving two males and one female, and to be a play on the title of the 1984 film Ghostbusters.

It made a six-hour record flight and also flew as the Italian representative at the 1936 Olympics. Design and development The Orione was a cantilever high-wing monoplane, designed for high performance, competition flying and record breaking. Its wing had a rectangular-plan central piece, occupying about one-third of the span, and outer straight tapered panels with rounded tips. Ailerons occupied the whole trailing edges of these outer panels and were unusual in extending aft beyond the trailing edge of the centre section. There were no inboard flaps or air brakes. It had an oval cross-section fuselage of pod and boom form, much slimmer aft of the wing. The pilot's cockpit was slightly ahead of the leading edge. Originally the cockpit was open, though with a long, unstepped, multi- paned glazing ahead of the seat; later this was replaced by an enclosing multi-framed canopy that merged aft into the fuselage. The tail unit was rather similar to that of the earlier Falco, with a single piece, all moving elevator with a straight leading edge and a semi-elliptical trailing edge and a small triangular fin which supported a much larger, tall balanced rudder, essentially triangular in shape but with rounded vertices. Hinged above the elevator trailing edge, which had a large cut-out for its movement, the rudder extended down to the keel where it was protected by a small, faired underfin/tail bumper. There was a short landing skid running from near the nose to below mid-chord. The Orione was first flown in 1932. There is firm evidence for the construction of just one example. This aircraft was one of two Italian representatives at the Berlin Olympic games of 1936 (the other was the Bonomi BS.20 Albanella), part of a successful demonstration to establish gliding as an Olympic sport (Gliding at the 1936 Summer Olympics). The following year it took part in the First Italian National Gliding Competition, held in Asiago in August; flown by Aldo Tait it set an Italian endurance record with a flight of 5 hr 58 min. Near the start of World War II there were plans to produce a version with a span increase, the Orione 2, but this was never built. Variants ;Orione 1: Competition glider, flown 1932.

The Criminal Law (Forensic Procedures) Amendment Act No. 37 of 2013 (the \\"DNA Act\\") provides for the expansion and administration of such a database in South Africa, enabling the South African Police Service (SAPS) to match forensic DNA profiles derived from samples collected at crime scenes with forensic DNA profiles of offenders convicted of, and suspects arrested for, offences listed in a new Schedule 8 of the amended Criminal Procedure Act of 1977. Before the DNA Act: DCID DNA profiling has been used in South African law enforcement since 1998, albeit without a legal framework prior to the commencement of the DNA Act. The DNA Criminal Intelligence Database (DCID) was developed by SAPS and is administered by the Biology Unit of the SAPS Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL). The repository of DNA Profiles held by the FSL prior to the commencement of the DNA Act comprises two indices, namely a Casework Index containing forensic DNA profiles derived from biological samples collected from crime scenes and a Reference Index containing forensic DNA profiles of known people, including victims, suspects, volunteers and personnel. The Criminal Procedure Act of 1977 currently prevents DNA samples from being taken from convicted offenders. The DNA profiles in the DCID are generated by analysing an AmpFlSTR Profiler Plus STR multiplex system of 9 different STR loci (D3S1358, vWA, FGA, D8S1179, D21S11, D18S51, D5S818, D13S317 and D7S820) plus Amelogenin for sex determination. There were approximately 80,000 DNA profiles on the DCID in 2007, with the number increasing to approximately 180,000 by late 2013. DNA Act: NFDD The Criminal Law (Forensic Procedures) Amendment Act No. 37 of 2013 (the \\"DNA Act\\") provides for the expansion, regulation and administration of a national DNA database known as the National Forensic DNA Database of South Africa (NFDD). The initial Criminal Law (Forensic Procedures) Amendment Bill drafted in 2008 was tabled in Parliament in 2009 and subsequently split into two separate bills. The Criminal Law (Forensic Procedures) Amendment Bill [B2–2009], dealing with fingerprints and other body-prints, was assented to in 2010 and came into effect on 18 January 2013. A separate bill unofficially known as the \\"DNA Bill\\" was re-introduced to Parliament in May 2013. It addresses various concerns that arose regarding the initial bill, including those relating to human rights issues. The final version of the DNA Bill, namely the Criminal Law (Forensic Procedures) Amendment Bill [B9D–2013], was passed by the National Assembly on 12 November 2013, and was assented to by President Jacob Zuma on 23 January 2014. The commencement date of the DNA Act is 31 January 2015. The DNA Act provides inter alia for: *the amendment of the South African Police Service Act of 1995 to facilitate the establishment and regulation of the NFDD *the taking of specified bodily samples from certain categories of persons for the purposes of forensic DNA analysis *the conditions under which the samples or forensic DNA profiles derived from the samples may be retained or the periods within which they must be destroyed *the use of forensic DNA profiles in the investigation of crime and the use of such profiles in proving the innocence or guilt of persons before or during a prosecution or the exoneration of convicted persons *assistance in the identification of missing persons and unidentified human remains The NFDD comprises six indices containing forensic DNA profiles, namely a Crime Scene Index, an Arrestee Index, a Convicted Offender (CO) index, an Investigative Index, an Elimination Index and a Missing Persons and Unidentified Human Remains Index. Mandatory DNA sampling applies to persons convicted of, and persons arrested for, offences listed in a new Schedule 8 of the amended Criminal Procedure Act of 1977. The offences listed in Schedule 8 may be amended after the initial implementation phase which takes into account capacity constraints. The DNA profiles in the NFDD are generated by analysing 15 different STR loci plus Amelogenin for sex determination. Different retention frameworks apply to each the six different indices. The Crime Scene Index contains forensic DNA profiles obtained from all crime scene samples (biological evidence collected from crime scenes) which will be held on the NFDD indefinitely. The Arrestee Index and Convicted Offender Index contains forensic DNA profiles of all persons arrested or convicted, as the case may be, of a Schedule 8 offence which range from rape and murder to burglary. Forensic DNA Profiles entered into the Arrestee Index will either be migrated to the Convicted Offender Index upon conviction, where they will be held indefinitely, or removed within three years if the arrest does not result in a conviction. Forensic DNA profiles obtained from volunteers with informed consent will be held under the Investigative Index and will be removed from the NFDD within 3 months of the case being finalised. The repository of DNA profiles held by the state FSL was expected to be transferred to the NFDD within 3 months of the DNA database being operational. In 2013, the FSL was investigating implementing the Combined DNA Index System, which is the database and software developed by the FBI. The DNA Act is subject to a five-year implementation plan which takes into account new training and equipment requirements. DNA Project As in Brazil, families of crime victims in South Africa have successfully campaigned for the establishment of a national forensic DNA database. The DNA Project, a non- profit organisation, is an advocacy initiative founded by attorney Vanessa Lynch following the unsolved murder of Lynch's father, John Lynch, in 2004. The DNA Project advocates the establishment and expansion of a national forensic DNA database and hence earlier identification of criminal suspects. It has campaigned for the passing of the DNA Bill, donated laboratory equipment to the FSL, funded the UK Forensic Science Service's diagnostic review of South Africa's FSL, initiated DNA forensic awareness training programs, and developed a post-graduate forensic analyst qualification.

Caudy was born in the Netherlands, immigrated to the Thirteen Colonies in the 1730s, and settled within the Cacapon River valley near present-day Capon Bridge in Hampshire County. As early as 1741, Caudy was associated with the arrangement and development of transportation routes throughout present-day Hampshire County. Caudy twice hosted George Washington; first during his surveying expedition in 1748 and again upon Washington's 1750 return to the Cacapon River valley. Caudy participated in the French and Indian War and is best known for having purportedly defended himself from a band of Native American fighters on Caudy's Castle—a sandstone outcrop that now bears his name. According to tradition, Caudy used his long rifle barrel to push his Native American attackers off the rock into the Cacapon River below. In his later life, Caudy became involved in a land dispute with John Capper that was resolved by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron in November 1762. Caudy died in 1784 and was interred on his property south of present-day Capon Bridge. According to local tradition, Caudy was buried with a Native American on either side of him, while another tradition says Caudy was buried with his horse. Early life James Caudy was born in 1707 in the Netherlands. He possibly arrived in the Thirteen Colonies through Prince George's County in the Province of Maryland in the 1730s. While in Prince George's County, Caudy married his first wife, Mary Hutchinson.  Settlement in Virginia  Around 1738, Caudy and fellow frontiersman Joseph Edwards purchased tracts of land along the Cacapon River. He and Edwards were accompanied by the first two families of European descent to settle in the Cacapon River valley. Caudy and his family settled on in the Cacapon River valley near present-day Capon Bridge in what was then Orange County. Caudy's land parcel was located to the south of Edwards's ; the present-day U.S. Route 50 (Northwestern Turnpike) approximately corresponds to the boundary between Caudy's and Edwards's land parcels.  Development of transportation routes  George Washington (pictured) stayed overnight at Caudy's cabin during a surveying expedition in 1748, and surveyed land for Caudy when he returned to the Cacapon River valley in 1750. As early as 1741, Caudy was associated with the arrangement and development of transportation routes throughout present-day Hampshire County. On March 25, 1742, an Orange County court order mandated that Jeremiah Smith and James Eaton \\"view and lay\\" a road from Caudy's land to Isaac Perkins's mill near Winchester. That year, a wagon road was constructed between Winchester and Caudy's land tract. By 1744, this route was extended from Caudy's property to the North River at present-day North River Mills. This route later terminated at the mouth of Patterson Creek on the North Branch Potomac River and connected Winchester with Cumberland, Maryland. In December 1742, the County Court of Orange County ordered the construction of another wagon road from Caudy's land to the South Branch Potomac River. In 1743, a wagon road connecting Winchester and Moorefield traversed Caudy's land using a ford in the Cacapon River. This road led to a watermill near Old Fields on the South Branch Potomac River. Due to the location of Caudy's settlement along the Winchester–Moorefield route, his residence served as an overnight stopping point for George Washington and George William Fairfax in April 1748. Washington and Fairfax were returning to Winchester en route to Belvoir following their surveying expedition in the South Branch Potomac River valley in present-day Hardy County. Washington and his surveying party stayed overnight in Caudy's log cabin. On April 12, 1750, George Washington surveyed a plot of \\"waste land\\" for Caudy, using white oak trees as boundary markers. Caudy and John Stewart of Frederick County coordinated the layout and construction of further transportation routes through the region, and were respected for their efforts. Following Stewart's death in 1750, Stewart left his eldest son in the charge of Caudy and Captain Jeremiah Smith, who both procured land along the Cacapon River for him.  French and Indian War  = Caudy's Castle incident = James Caudy single-handedly fended off Native American fighters within the craggy recesses of a rock formation (pictured), pushing them into the Cacapon River below. This formation was later known as Caudy's Castle. According to local tradition and folklore, Caudy is known as an \\"Indian fighter\\". Upon detecting a Native American stalker in pursuit of him, Caudy pretended to flee along a pathway leading up the mountain toward the craggy bluffs spanning between above the Cacapon River, south of present- day Forks of Cacapon. This pathway edged around the face of a rock formation overlooking the Cacapon River, and narrowed into a rocky ledge. Another legend says Caudy was leading a group of pioneer settlers in defense against Native American attacks. In both versions of the story, Caudy awaited his pursuers within the craggy recesses of the rock formation. The narrow recesses within the pinnacle's sandstone ledges allowed only single file passage through the rock outcrop toward the formation's face. As Caudy's followers traversed the outcrop's narrow passes and ledges, Caudy is said to have used his long rifle barrel to push them one-by-one off the rock formation into the Cacapon River below. Other legends say Caudy used the tactic atop this rock on several occasions. The outcrop was named \\"Caudy's Castle,\\" by which it is still known. With the exception of this event, there exist no other accounts of encounters or conflicts between Caudy and Native Americans. =French and Indian War service= During the French and Indian War, Caudy remained on his property on the Cacapon River; he staunchly defended it and likely sought further protection at Fort Edwards to the north. Caudy's residence may have been fortified; it was known as \\"Coddy's Fort\\". This fortification was not part of the \\"chain of forts\\" organized by George Washington for the defense of settlers against Native American raids in the South Branch Potomac and Cacapon River valleys. Caudy also served as a drummer in Maryland frontiersman Michael Cresap's militia. Caudy hosted Washington again in 1755, providing Washington with an ample supply of grass seed that was likely produced in one of Caudy's fertile fields known as \\"Caudy's Meadow\\". Civil engineer Claudius Crozet later mentioned Caudy's Meadow in his fieldnotes during the planning and construction of the Northwestern Turnpike nearby. Washington sent payment for the grass seed to Caudy through James Wood, the founder of Winchester, Virginia.  Later life and death  A West Virginia state highway historical marker commemorating Caudy's defense from Native American attack at Caudy's Castle. The marker is located along West Virginia Route 127 near Forks of Cacapon. Following his marriage to the widow of James McCoy by 1761, Caudy intended to acquire McCoy's east of Great North Mountain in Frederick County. Caudy's claim to McCoy's land was disputed by John Capper, who claimed to have purchased McCoy's property before his death. A feud developed between Caudy and Capper; it was resolved by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron in November 1762. Lord Fairfax awarded to Caudy and the remainder of the disputed land to Capper. Caudy never learned to write in English; he signed his last will and testament with an X mark in 1784. Caudy died on March 15, 1784, and was interred on his property south of present-day Capon Bridge. According to local tradition, Caudy was buried with a Native American on either side of him. Another tradition says he was buried with his horse. The site of Caudy's interment is located on property now known as Hartford Bealer farm. In the 1930s, Caudy's burial site was attended to by a local Boy Scouts troop, who landscaped the site and planted shrubbery. By 1976, Caudy's burial place was marked with four posts. In 2002, the Capon Bridge Ruritan Club removed the overgrown shrubs and erected a white fence around Caudy's interment site. The project was initiated by Capon Bridge area residents Roy Giffin, Ken Edmonds, and Roberta Munske. The Ruritans purchased a marble marker and erected it on the site at 9 a.m. on November 15, 2003. The burial site is accessible and visible from Christian Church Road, West Virginia Secondary Route 13. Marriages and issue Caudy's first marriage was to Mary Hutchinson in Prince George's County, Maryland. He and Mary had five children together: * David Caudy (died in November 1782), married Martha Hiett * Ann Caudy Dulany, married a Mr. Dulany * Margaret Caudy Wood, married Daniel Wood * Mary Caudy Kinman, married Samuel Kinman * Sarah Caudy Hancher, married John Hancher By 1761, Caudy had married the widow of James McCoy, who lived across Great North Mountain in Frederick County.

It is said he first appeared upon the stage in the arms of his mother, Mary Stafford Cooper, at the age of eighteen months when the comic opera Castle Grim was performed in Dublin. His family moved to the United States when he was eight, and he soon appeared on the American stage in the melodrama Silver King in 1889.\\"Claude Cooper Dead.\\" New York Times, 21 July 1932, p. 17.Hobart, Doty. \\"Encore.\\" Radio Digest, December 1930, p. 112.

This early form of sound film was not successful in the United States, in part due to Thomas Edison's obstruction, and Gaumont abandoned American production in 1910. The Flushing studio then became the home of Solax Studios, a newly established silent film production company that hired former Gaumont employees including Claude Cooper who directed Solax's first twelve productions.McMahan, Alison.

Cooper appeared in silent films from a variety of East Coast companies, including the All Star Film Corporation, the Famous Players Film Company, the Reliance Film Company, and the Kinemacolor Company of America. However, his longest association was with the Thanhouser Film Corporation of New Rochelle, New York, for whom he worked, usually as an actor but sometimes as a director, from 1914 to 1917.

The charity was founded in 2009 by Aneeta Prem and the chair of trustees is Toby Harris. Awareness and helpline for forced marriage, FGM and dishonour abuse The charity provides educational material and teaching and training programmes for schools & front line professionals and runs a 24/7 helpline supported by trained professionals. It is thought there may be 8,000 forced marriages each year in Britain and it is most prevalent in communities originating in South Asia. The charity operates its own website and also uses social media websites. In conjunction with the UK government's Forced Marriage Unit and the Metropolitan Police, the charity provides a smartphone app which, to divert suspicion, ostensibly looks like a game but which gives information regarding forced marriage for victims and carers and allows helplines to be called and emergency help to be summoned. The organisation aims to give every teenager in Britain a copy of Prem's book But It's Not Fair, a book with governmental recommendation. Freedom Charity was founded by Aneeta Prem, a magistrate, who was born in London. When working as a karate teacher in London, Prem encountered the problem of forced marriages when teaching martial arts to young women. On 16 June 2014, The Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 (UK)Legislation on Forced Marriagehttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/12/contents/enacted made forcing someone into marriage a criminal offence. The charity marked the change in legislation by launching a hashtag campaign #freedom2choose and a video to help raise awareness of the change in legislation was produced. The video featured The Home Secretary, Theresa May; Aneeta Prem, founder of Freedom Charity; Sophie Lott from the government's Forced Marriage Unit; Commander Mak Chishty, National Police Lead on Forced Marriage; Nazir Afzal, Chief Crown Prosecutor of the Crown Prosecution Service for North West England, Edward Pleeth, a barrister; plus an anonymous victim of forced marriage, Domestic slavery rescue In October 2013, the organisation was contacted by three women in London saying they had been held as domestic slaves for thirty years. A television documentary on forced marriages, followed by an interview with Prem describing the work of Freedom Charity, had prompted one of the victims to call the helpline. Freedom contacted the Metropolitan Police who managed the women's rescue with the assistance of the charity which held secret telephone calls with the captives. Two suspects were arrested. Red Triangle symbol An inverted red triangle containing a gold heart is the international symbol for solidarity against FGM. The symbol was first used in 2016 by Aneeta Prem in her novel Cut Flowers and further more as part of the Freedom Charity Red Triangle Campaign on 6 February 2016 for the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation. The National Police Chiefs’ Council and Freedom charity campaign sold red triangle badges to raise awareness among people that FGM is a crime. The proceeds were used to supply books about FGM to schools. The Red Triangle symbol represents the female form. =Origins= The red triangle (FGM) symbol was devised by Aneeta Prem, a British author, human rights campaigner, magistrate and the founder and president of Freedom Charity. =Red Triangle campaign 2017= Monday 6 February 2017 saw Freedom Charity launch the Red Triangle campaign. Set to run until International Women's Day on 8 March, the campaign aims to help eradicate Female Genital Mutilation FGM/C in a generation. Those taking part in the campaign are encouraged to wear a small downward facing red triangle to symbolise solidarity against Female Genital Mutilation. Cut Flowers (book) \\"Cut Flowers\\" is a novel written by Aneeta Prem, the founder of Freedom. The novel is about female genital mutilation FGM. Katie and Sophia are just two ordinary girls eagerly awaiting the summer holidays until their teacher, Miss Adams, gives them their summer homework – to prepare a presentation about what they did over the holidays. Little did they know that it would be the start of a lifelong mission to protect young girls all over the world. When Katie finally returns from Africa she needs all of Sophia’s support and creative flair to shine a spotlight on something that’s affecting millions of girls worldwide, but that no one seems to want to talk about… The book has PSHE Association lesson plans to accompany it. The book warns about the dangers of FGM, and is being distributed to schoolchildren to raise awareness of the illegal practice. But It's Not Fair (book) \\"But It's Not Fair\\" draws on the author Aneeta Prems' extensive experience supporting child victims of Forced Marriage and dishonour based crimes through her work with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Government Ministers, the police, survivors and her experiences as a magistrate. The story is written from the view of a young British girl, Vinny, whose friend almost becomes a victim of Forced Marriage. The book is presented in a chatty and easy-to-read style, but it carries some powerful messages. It not only raises awareness of Forced Marriage and highlights some of the key signs associated with Forced Marriage, but it also suggests courses of action that could help potential victims. Freedom Charity distributes copies of \\"But It's Not Fair\\" free to schools, alongside lesson plans for teachers.

Owen Browne Carter (1806 – 30 March 1859) was an English architect, based in Winchester. Life The library in Winchester, built as the Corn Exchange to Carter's designs Carter was born in London in 1806. He spent 10 years employed in the office of the architect William Garbett (1770–1834) in Winchester, where he was to spend most of his life. Following Garbett's death, Carter oversaw the construction of St John's South, a group of almshouses, to his late employer's design. In about 1829–30 he went to Egypt in the company of Robert Hay. He spent some time in Cairo, where he made a large number of architectural and topographical drawings, about fifty of which are in collection of the British Museum. Some of these drawings were lithographed under Carter's supervision, and published by Hay in 1840 in a folio volume entitled Illustrations of Cairo. In and around 1836, shortly after his travels to Egypt, he began work on re-designing Nork House, in Banstead, Surrey. The works was commissioned by the Right Honorable Lord Arden, who had bought the house and large extensive estate a few years before. The house was built in 1614, but had been remodeled and re designed to suit previous owners. The works by Carter were the largest the house had seen, and ensured the mansion house stood the biggest grandest house there was for many years to come. Drawings of the house and plans by Carter are currently held by Metropolitan Museum of Arts, in New York, America. They are strictly copyrighted by the museum and single pages are worth hundreds of pounds, therefore can not be published anywhere.  N.M He then afterwards drew up designs for the new church of St Peter, Southampton, and for the rebuilding of St Matthew, Otterbourne (in collaboration with the squire, William Yonge, replacing an older church about half-a-mile away), St Mary, Nutley, and St. Michael and All Angels, Knights Enham, although the last of these was not carried out. Carter was also responsible for restorations or alterations at St. Peter ad Vincula, Colemore; St. Leonard, Grately and St Leonard, Oakley, all in Hampshire. His buildings in Winchester included the New Corn Exchange (now a public library), with a central portico modelled on that of Inigo Jones' St Paul, Covent Garden. Describing the front of the building, The Gentleman's Magazine said that Carter had \\"endeavoured to avoid the flimsy effect of the modern Grecian school, and to keep in view the more legitimate style of design inculcated by Palladio in Italy, and at home by our own countrymen, Jones and Wren.\\" In 1845 he restored the Great Hall of the Royal Palace at Winchester, renewing the stonework of the parapet and gables, and the plate tracery in the windows, removing the late 18th-century wooden window frames, and replacing the Georgian brick porch with one of a Gothic design. He exhibited architectural drawings at the Royal Academy between 1847 and 1851, showing designs for the rebuilding of Holyrood church, Southampton, and for restorations of the Poultry Cross at Salisbury (carried out in 1852-4) and the screen at Winchester Cathedral. His address is given in the catalogues as 22 Southgate Street, Winchester. He published some works on local subjects such as Picturesque Memorials of Winchester (1830), and contributed articles to John Weale's Quarterly Papers on Architecture on the stained-glass windows of Winchester Cathedral, on Beaulieu Abbey, and on the churches of Penton Mewsey, Headbourne Worthy, and Bishopstone. All these articles were illustrated with his own drawings. George Edmund Street, a relative, received his initial architectural training with Carter in 1841–44. Carter was a cousin of a painter and art teacher called Haseler, Street's uncle by marriage. Death Carter died at Salisbury on 30 March 1859, aged 53.

He was released in March 2019. The transfer is reportedly part of negotiations for a $30 billion concessional lending facility for Angola, the money being returned to the country’s central bank. The move to criminalise the loan negotiations with foreign lenders is seen as a means to undermine the political clout of the previous administration with the populace while at the same time shore up support for the new administration within the ruling party MPLA.

The group will generally consist of individuals who have money to invest and people who might be in a position where they would be seeking investors. The LION is designed to create opportunities for local businesses, individuals, and local investors to network and develop informal relationships. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has created some very specific laws about how one can ask for money. These laws limit any kind of public offerings of shares/interest in a company (i.e. securities), unless there are proper filings and the people investing are considered accredited investors. There is a general exemption that the SEC does not regulate where the investors are friends with the people they are investing in. The LION hosts informal gatherings with the idea that friendships would form and the SEC guidelines would not be violated when any investments occur. The LION also documents who attends the gatherings as a means of creating a paper trail proving that the individuals involved in an investment had the opportunity to form an informal relationship. The LION does not facilitate any dealings, nor does it allow businesses to make pitches soliciting investments to the group. All investments that might occur as a result of the LION meetings would occur outside of a LION meeting and be wholly arranged by the individuals involved in that business dealing. The first Local Investing Opportunity Network was formed in Port Townsend, Washington as part of the Transition Towns movement.

Background  The statue was originally commissioned by the Windstar Foundation, an environmental non-profit organization that Denver founded in the 1970s. Since its unveiling in 2002, the Spirit statue was a fixture at the Windstar property in Snowmass, Colorado, but it was moved following the dissolution of the Windstar Foundation. The Windstar property was sold in early 2013.  Current location  In September 2013, after the Windstar Foundation was dissolved and its assets sold, the Spirit statue was removed from the Snowmass property and given to the Colorado Music Hall of Fame. Spirit moved with the Colorado Music Hall of Fame to its new location at Red Rocks in 2015. Although some of Denver's fans were upset to see the Windstar property sold and the Spirit statue moved, most people – including Denver's former wife – think the Colorado Music Hall of Fame is a fitting location for the massive statue.

PUP's self-titled debut album was released on October 8, 2013 on Royal Mountain Records. In December 2013, PUP signed with SideOneDummy Records and re- released their debut album in the United States on April 8, 2014. The group was in the studio in late 2015 recording their second album The Dream Is Over which was released on May 27, 2016 through SideOneDummy. The band's third album, titled Morbid Stuff, was released on April 5, 2019. History =Origins and formation= Bassist Nestor Chumak, guitarist Steve Sladkowski, and drummer Zack Mykula are childhood friends who attended school in Toronto together. Two of them met in third grade, and the third met them in high school at Humberside Collegiate Institute. Throughout their childhood, they played in a number of bands together. Vocalist and guitarist Stefan Babcock also grew up playing in bands in Toronto. During high school, Babcock was the lead guitarist for a ska band called Stop Drop N Skank that he formed with some of his classmates at Earl Haig Secondary School. Babcock encountered Chumak, Sladkowski, and Mykula on occasion at local Toronto music venues, but was not close with them at the time. After high school, Babcock's band Stop Drop N Skank dissolved. While attending Ryerson University, he worked with Nestor Chumak to record a song he had written for a school project. Following its completion, the duo teamed up with Chumak's friends Sladkowski and Mykula to form a group called Topanga. The name comes from Topanga Matthews, a character on the 1990s Disney sitcom Boy Meets World whom the band has called \\"our first middle-school crush.\\" They decided to record a four-track EP together, although Babcock says that at the time, they considered this a one- off project and didn't think of themselves as a \\"real band.\\" Topanga EP (later retitled Lionheart EP) was released as a free download on December 7, 2010. =Early days as a band= Topanga performing at a bar in Ottawa in 2012 Shortly after the release of their debut EP, the band began performing live together. They played their first show ever at the Bovine Sex Club in January 2011. According to Babcock, the EP was gaining traction online, and they began receiving increasingly better show offers. By the beginning of 2012, they had begun touring with Hollerado and were signed to Hollerado's label, Royal Mountain Records. On February 15, 2012, they released the two-track Oceans 7\\" with Royal Mountain. In 2012, Topanga began contemplating making their first full-length album, and wanted to find a producer who could help them capture their heavy performance style in a studio recording. Inspired by The Bronx's 2008 self-titled album, they were interested in working with its producer, Dave Schiffman, an industry veteran who had worked with artists such as Rage Against the Machine, Weezer, and Anti-Flag. They sent him a demo and, to their surprise, he liked it and soon flew to Toronto to begin working on their album. The album was recorded in Montréal, in a studio that belongs to professional former F1 driver Jacques Villeneuve. While working on the album, the band decided to change their name from Topanga to something else. According to Babcock, they felt the name was less fitting now that they had locked down a heavy punk rock style (as opposed to the lighter rock style they had played early on). In addition, Disney had announced a new spinoff series based on Boy Meets World, and the band didn't want to be associated with it. After a few months of uncertainty, they decided on the name PUP. The name is an acronym of a quote by Babcock's grandmother, who said that playing in a rock band was a \\"pathetic use of potential.\\" The band officially announced their new name via social media on April 16, 2013. A banner from Topanga's Bandcamp site announcing the new name and logo =PUP= The upcoming album's release date was set for October 8, 2013. From September to the end of November 2013, PUP joined Hollerado and the Zolas on a 24-stop tour across Canada to promote the album. Upon its release, the self-titled debut album, PUP, was met with critical praise. The Calgary Herald named PUP one of Canada's best new bands, and Stereogum listed them as one of the top 40 new bands of 2013. PUP won two Bucky Awards from CBC Radio 3 for Best Live Show and Best New Artist in 2013, and was nominated for Best Video. In December 2013, PUP signed with SideOneDummy Records and re-released their debut album in the United States on April 8, 2014. In 2014, they went on their first tour of the UK, playing 8 shows around the country with the UK band Slaves. The first two shows of the tour in London were part of the NME Awards tour. After that they played South By Southwest in Austin, Texas, followed by several more London shows and the Groezrock festival in Belgium. In May they started an extensive tour of the US with the Menzingers, Lemuria and Cayetana, playing 32 shows in 39 days. In August they opened for the Hives in London, England, and then played at Reading and Leeds Festivals. In September 2014, they made first appearance on Riot Fest at Chicago and Toronto. The Masquerade in Atlanta in 2014 In late 2014, PUP completed its first head-lining tour of Canada and the US, culminating in a sold-out concert at Toronto's Lee's Palace featuring a \\"next level\\" performance. In early 2015, PUP completed a multi-city tour of Australia, supporting The Smith Street Band. PUP then participated in the 2015 Vans Warped Tour, joining the tour for the month of July, including a highly anticipated date in Toronto, the band's hometown and place where the band has enjoyed success. This was the band's first time playing the Molson Amphitheatre. Between October and December 2015, the group supported Modern Baseball on their headlining US tour. =The Dream Is Over= In early 2016, PUP headlined a very select number of shows in New York City. They also released a new track, \\"DVP\\", from their second album. and also they announce upcoming second album The Dream Is Over which was released on May 27, 2016 through SideOneDummy. On May 27, 2016, PUP released their second album, The Dream Is Over. According to the band, the title is a direct quote from Babcock's doctor after damaging his vocal cords. PUP performing in New York in October 2016 PUP toured the US, Canada, Australia and Europe in 2016 on a headlining tour entitled \\"If this tour doesn't kill you, I will\\", which is also the name of the first track on the album. In early 2017, PUP headlined European shows with The Wonder Years and Tiny Moving Parts. During spring and summer 2017 the band made their first appearances at several music festivals, including Shaky Knees, Boston Calling, WayHome, Lollapalooza, and Osheaga. In September 2017, PUP made their cable television debut on Last Call with Carson Daly on NBC, performing \\"Sleep in the Heat\\" and \\"If This Tour Doesn't Kill You, I Will / DVP\\".

Overview Statue of Robert Burns in Bernard Street The street is named after innkeeper Bernard Lindsay who was granted the barony of the area by King James VI. In 1780, the first public sewer in Scotland was built in Bernard Street, flowing into the Water of Leith. The iron seal of the sewer is still visible by the bridge at the end of Bernard Street. At the east end of the street is a statue of Robert Burns by David Watson Stevenson erected in 1898. Other buildings include the premises of Leith Merchants Club and the former home of the Leith Banking Company. Today, the buildings of Bernard Street have been converted to use as pubs, cafes and the offices of media, marketing and publishing companies. From the mid-18th century, a stagecoach service ran from Bernard Street to the city's Old Town. Bernard Street was also formerly the terminus of one of Edinburgh's tram lines and was to have had a tram stop as part of the new Edinburgh Trams development.

It is housed in a historic building, which is considered to be a landmark in the area. History In 1915, a branch library was established for Remuera. It was originally located in the brick shops located at 411–413 Remuera Road. The building had previously belonged to the Remuera Road Board, which amalgamated with the Auckland City Council in the same year. In 1926, parts of this building were taken to Point Chevalier and used to construct the public library there. On 31 July 1926, the Remuera Library was opened on its present site. The building was designed by the architectural firm Gummer and Ford, who were then one of the leading firms in Auckland. The building shows influences of Neo-Georgian and Arts and Crafts style architecture, stemming from Gummer's study in England under Edwin Lutyens. It has a largely open plan design, which was innovative at the time. The building won a NZIA gold medal for its design in 1928. The building features a large lecture hall which had previously been used to deliver public lectures. At some point in the mid- twentieth century, Auckland Libraries ceased their public lecture series (largely due to declining interest) and the lecture hall was converted to accommodate the library's growing collection. There is an entrance to the library through the lecture hall which remained closed for much of its existence. There were various additions made to the library during the late 1950s and early 1960s, including the building of partitioning walls. A major heritage restoration project was undertaken in 2002. This restoration undid many of the additions that had been made during the 1950s and 1960s. A disabilities ramp was installed leading to Saint Vincent Avenue and the lecture hall entrance to the library was finally re-opened. The staff workroom was also expanded, utilising the former stage as floorspace. These renovations led to the library winning another NZIA medal in 2004 in the Heritage and Conservation category. In 2006, there was some debate about the gnomon on the sundial installed outside the library being set in the wrong direction, and therefore not working.

The song was released by Nippon Columbia in October 1938.http://www.kosekiyuji-kinenkan.jp/sakkyoku/kashu-a.html History In the wake of the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in July 1937, demand for patriotic songs to boost public and military morale swelled in Japan. Newspapers regularly held competitions calling for submissions from the public of songs and song lyrics. The lyrics for Roei no Uta were chosen in such a fashion, after a contest jointly held by the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun and Osaka Mainichi Shimbun. The jury, which consisted of luminaries such as the writer Kan Kikuchi and the poet Hakushū Kitahara, awarded Kīchirō Yabūchi's Roei no Uta as the winning entry. The 28-year-old composer Yūji Koseki was chosen to set the lyrics to music. Nippon Columbia recorded the song soon after with singers Tadaharu Nakano, Akira Matsudaira, Noboru Kirishima, Hisao Itō, and Akira Sasaki performing, backed by the Nippon Columbia house orchestra under the direction of the composer. The song, originally the B-side to the which was performed by the Toyama Military Academy's band and male chorus, quickly eclipsed its discmate in popularity, eventually selling in excess of 600,000 copies. The song became one of the most famous gunka in Japan, establishing Yūji Koseki at the forefront of Japanese composers of the era.

The story was first published in Uncle Scrooge #5 (March–May 1954) by Dell Publishing with three one-page gag stories by the Barkses: \\"Hospitality Week\\", \\"McDuck Takes a Dive\\", and \\"Slippery Sipper\\". The cover was drawn by Barks. The Secret of Atlantis and the gag stories have been reprinted many times. Characters in the story include Uncle Scrooge, Donald Duck, and Donald's nephews: Huey, Dewey, and Louie. The \\"Junior Woodchuck's Book of Knowledge\\", a forerunner of the Junior Woodchuck Guidebook, is mentioned, and the story features the first appearance of Scrooge's \\"worry room\\". Another first time debut was Donald's residence, listed as \\"1313 Webfoot Drive\\". It was split into three parts that ran conjuctive to each other, who gets the last word on debt, chasing after a coin which culminates into a pie fight (at a place called the \\"Atlas Bakery\\", giving a cryptic hint of the main plot), then finally Scrooge and Donald's discovery, and subsequent escape from, Atlantis. Plot After checking his books, Uncle Scrooge sees a long overdue debt from 1950. He angrily remarks that the debt is too small to litigate, then decides to hire Donald Duck as a debt collector, promising him 50%, only for Donald to learn he is the debtor, owing ten cents. A battle of the last word ensues when Donald pays the debt with a quarter, demanding change plus his fee, then laughs he settled his debt to Scrooge for 1/2. Scrooge pulls one over on Donald by giving him a nickel from Balonia. However, when the nephews remark that currency is no longer minted as Balonia became defunct after the First World War, Donald sells the nickel to a coin dealer for five American dollars. Uncle Scrooge admits Donald won, but seeks another plan, using the same 1916 American quarter Donald originally paid with. Scrooge then launches into incessant advertising, saying he will pay 50 cents to anyone who holds a 1916 quarter. This results in eveyone sending him their quarters simply for the advertising to stop. Scrooge then takes a cargo plane and dumps all the quarters into the Atlantic Ocean, save for Donald's own, which is now appraised at the astronomical amount of ten skyrillion dollars. However, a mishap causes the quarter to roll all over Duckburg and the ducks cause all sorts of mishap to retrieve it, only for it to ultimately end up being flattened by a steamroller. The coin needs to be replaced, but Scrooge mopes he hid the coins too well. However, when Scrooge recalls a specific patch of ocean where he dumped the coins, the nephews pinpoint it, causing Scrooge to get scientists to invent high-pressure diving suits. When Donald and Scrooge dive, they see the depths are actually become lighter instead of darker, thanks to bioluminescent fish. It's then that they discover the lost city of Atlantis. At first believed to be a ghost town, they are shocked to see fish people who bring them before their king, and the fish people are wearing the quarters as jewelry, as Atlantean law states anything that falls from the \\"air world\\" becomes Atlantean property. The king says that Donald and Scrooge will become subjects of Atlantis, and forbids them to leave for soon more would be here out of curiosity, and greedy men would also attack Atlantis to rob it of its treasures. The ducks are imprisoned until they have been determined to be good citizens of Atlantis. A fishman wearing a mortarboard hat, who is called \\"Professor\\", has been ordered to help the ducks acculturate. The professor explains that Atlantis was originally an Egyptian colony until a massive earthquake caused the land to sink. The land subsidence was slow, and the men kept building the cities farther up mountains, topped with conelike air intakes, until everything was sunk. However, in trying to fight the drowning, the humans found they could adapt underwater, and for millennia have been evolving with gills and other fishlike traits. When Dewey and Huey dive to rescue their uncles, they suffer the same fate of being imprisoned. However, they feign interest in living in Atlantis, which pleases the Professor to which he elects to release them on a guided tour of the city (but keeps Scrooge and Donald imprisoned, knowing they are not genuine). The Professor shows how electric fish aid Atlanteans in tasks such as lighting and cooking. When the nephews ask how the Professor speaks English, he replies Atlanteans know all languages of the air world, as the world's original language was spoken in Atlantis, and the sinking spared Atlanteans from the diaspora caused by the destruction of the Tower of Babel. The nephews then encounter a sunken cargo plane, which has been cordoned as off-limits, as such planes in the past have caused destruction to Atlantis due to unexploded bombs. However, exploring it the nephews find the plane was carrying jukeboxes. The Professor is at first cautious of such a device, but his intellectual curiosity gets the better of him and he admits ths Atlanteans haven't made music. The jukebox doesn't work, but the Professor summons an electric eel to power the appliance, and provides one of the 1916 quarters to pay for a song. When a 1940s big band song starts playing, an excited Professor summons the entire population, and soon all Atlanteans are enjoying a dance party. When the guards join in on the party, Huey and Dewey grab a sack of quarters, then free their two uncles. The four swim to the freedom, but are almost stopped by guards throwing tridents at them. One of them ruptures the sack of quarters, and Scrooge is only able to save one. Upon reaching a shallow depth, the Atlanteans must give up, as they risk asphyxiation for their lungs have evolved as being unable to breathe the surface air. The king begs them not to reveal their existence, and Dewey gives his word of honor as a Junior Woodchuck not to do so. Now back to safety, Scrooge promises that he will sell the sole quarter as soon as they reach home. But when he attempts to sell the ten skyrillion dollar quarter, the coin dealer replies that there is only one person in the world wealthy enough to afford such as astronomical sum: Scrooge himself. .

Cultural valuables were taken from Germany and placed in the Soviet Union. Years later, at the break up of the USSR, the said cultural valuables came to attention as the issue of ownership arose. Following, the debates between the Russian Duma and the Yeltsin government began, with the Duma focusing on compensation to Russia for wartime loss, and Yeltsin focusing on maintaining international relationships and agreements. Arising from the debate, were many struggles, but ultimately the enactment of the Federal Law on Cultural Valuables Displaced to the USSR as a Result of the Second World War and Located on the Territory of the Russian Federation. Background At the end of the Second World War in 1945, in what some would argue as retaliation, and others as compensation for the massive loss of cultural property the Soviet Union suffered, cultural valuables (such as books, art, artifacts, etc.) were taken (stolen, or relocated) from Germany. Since the end of the War the existence of such valuables were kept secret, and their existence was denied. In total during World War II, nearly thirty million Soviet people died as a result of prison camps, torture, starvation and cold blood murder. The USSR suffered a huge wartime loss, not only through cultural property but also by the deaths of millions of people. In 1991 when the collapse of the Soviet Union occurred, and the rise of the Russian Federation began, mention of vast amounts of hidden cultural valuables came to light because the issue of ownership arose. Debate =Yeltsin in Favour of Restitution 1992= In June 1992, a Decree of the Russian Government created what was called the State Commission for Restitution of Cultural Valuables, which was to decide issues related to restitution. However, the Commission did very little and was at a halt by June 1993, and then was later abolished by March 2001. Also, in 1992, there were many bilateral cultural agreements with a number of countries such as, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Luxembourg, Poland, and the United Kingdom for mutual restitution of displaced cultural valuables; none of which were talked about in the Constitutional Court ruling in 1999 about the constitutionality of the Russian 1998 law, where international agreements were to be put above domestic laws. However, in June 1992 there was the only restitution of books to the west by Russia; there was 600 Dutch books that were returned to the Netherlands. But, this is only a small portion of the estimated 30,000 Dutch books that had arrived in the USSR. The idea of restitution did not last long, and soon turned into demands for compensation. =Duma halts restitution 1994= Starting in 1994, the idea of restitution had completely come to a stop, and the debates started about constructing a law on said cultural valuables. Duma deputies are responsible for the start of the debate by stating that there is lack of international laws and the inadequacy of domestic legislation to justify its refusal to permit further restitution. This came about when Duma deputies refused the return of French archives that were a part of a 1992 agreement. Demands for compensation from wartime loss and destruction started to arise from the Duma deputies, suggesting that other countries should be charged storage fees for what was held in Russia secretly for over 50 years; and further that the only possible restitution of cultural valuables that would occur to other nations was in exchange for Russian cultural valuables, because the deputies at this point were arguing that many of the plundered cultural valuables from Russia were being held across the ocean from the United States Zone of Occupation in Germany. Further, with the support of some legal specialists and Russian legislators argue that all the cultural valuables that were brought to Moscow under government orders were all done so legally. But, nevertheless there is the other side of the debate, which is also supported by the Yeltsin government, who argue for compromise and internationally appropriate solutions. =Duma Proposes Law 1995 and 1996= For six years the debate continued. In January 1995 a large international conference was held in New York City titled \\"Spoils of War\\", where the international context about the issues surrounding cultural valuables plundered or misplaced at the end of the Second World War came to light. Firstly, it was important to note that no allied agreement that was made ever stated that works of art or other cultural property could be used for compensation purposes. Efforts such as what was done by the British and the Americans, where they carried out an elaborate program of restitution to countries of origin were discussed. Stories such as the United States had returned over half a million cultural items to the Soviet Union, but Russians were not aware of this, were among many topics discussed. On an international level, legal concepts and precedents existed during the time of the plundering from Germany in 1945, such as the Hague Convention of 1907. Specifically Article 56 of the Convention \\"forbids the seizure, damaging and destruction of property of educational and art institutions, … and articles of scientific and artistic value belonging to individuals and societies as well as to the State\\". Such international law did not stop Stalin from ordering the seizure of cultural valuables as compensatory reparations from Germany. However, Stalin's order is still followed by the Russian position 50 years later, as they would argue that these transfers (seizures) were carried out legally after the war as compensation. On the other side such a point of view is wrong because Russia is not in compliance with international law regarding the protection of cultural property. Despite the ongoing debate and Russia's failure to restitute cultural valuables to other European countries, Russia had an interest in becoming a member of the Council of Europe. In order for Russia to become a member they had to sign a statement of intent in order to be admitted, which they did and gained admission in late 1995. Russia at this time agreed to negotiate claims for the return of cultural property to other European countries, and to return property that was transferred to Moscow in 1945, in a rapid manner. Surprisingly, nothing to this agreement ever occurred or was of any mention in the Russian press; and less than a year later in May 1996 the Duma passed the first reading of the proposed law nationalizing the spoils of war. The law emphasized compensation to Russia for wartime loss. =Yeltsin's Position, July 1996= It was not long after, in early July 1996, the law was passed almost unanimously, making other European counties very hostile about the law. The passage started a slew of diplomatic protests, and as a result the Russian Upper House, the Council of the Federation, rejected the law strongly because of the outcry from the Yeltsin administration. Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation at the time, and his administration stood strong behind this argument for rejecting the law on the basis that it would conflict with numerous international agreements. =Duma Passes Law, March 1997= Nevertheless, the law continued to gain support from other nationalist-oriented parties, and the push for the passage of the law continued. The chair of the Duma Committee on Culture, Nikolai Gubenko, continued to stress that the law was a must, on the basis that all the cultural property that was transported to what was the Soviet Union was all done so legally according to allied agreements, and that the law is way of providing justice to the loved ones, nearly 30 million, that are no longer with us due to the horrific outcomes of the war. With more gained support, and a slightly revised law, the Duma again almost unanimously passed the law on February 5, 1997, and was further passed by the upper house, the Council of Federation on March 5, 1997. =Yeltsin Vetoes the Law, March 1997= Sticking to what he believed, and despite the ongoing support for the law, President Yeltsin vetoed the law on March 18, 1997. Making his position clear in his official message to the Duma, Yeltsin stood firm that the law was in contradiction of the Constitution. Further Yeltsin pointed out that the law went against Russian bilateral agreements with other European countries. Constitutional Court ruling Notwithstanding the President's power to veto the law, the Council of the Federation overrode Yeltsin's veto, with a vote of 141 to 37 in favor of the law on May 14, 1997. Regardless of the fact that the Council of the Federation overrode Yeltsin's veto, he still refused to sign the law, and further cited allegations of voting irregularities; and repeated his position that the law conflicted Russia's international legal obligations. President Yeltsin was forced to sign the law by the Constitutional Court in a decision on April 6, 1998. The Constitutional Court ruled that they were unable to consider the constitutionality of the law before the President signed it. So, on April 15, 1998, President Yeltsin signed the law making it officially Federal Law. The Law did return to Constitutional Court in 1999 for review on the basis of unconstitutionality, contradiction of Russia's international legal obligation and alleged irregular voting practices. The ruling of July 20, 1999 did rule in fact that parts of the law were unconstitutional and that parts of the voting process were violated; but despite these findings the law was still validated and found not in conflict with the Constitution. The ruling further stated that the cultural valuables that were relocated to now what is known as Russia at the end of the Second World War should not be returned to the former aggressor countries and should remain in Russia as a form of compensation. The law was sent back to the Duma for amendments to be made in November 1999, and then finally May 25th, 2000, the Federal Law received the Presidential signature from the then President Vladimir Putin. The law The Federal Law on Cultural Valuables Displaced to the USSR as a Result of World War II and Located on the Territory of the Russian Federation consists of six Chapters and twenty-five Articles. The Law is aimed at governing cultural valuables displaced to know what is known as Russia. The fundamental goals of the Federal Law are \\"to protect said valuables from misappropriation and prevent their illegal export beyond the borders of the Russian Federation as well as their unlawful transfer to whomsoever; to establish the necessary legal bases for treating said cultural valuables as partial compensation for the damage caused to the cultural property of the Russian Federation as a result of the plunder and destruction of its cultural valuables by Germany and its war allies during World War II; to protect the interests of the Russian Federation in the settlement of disputed issues with foreign states concerning said cultural valuables through consistent compliance with the principle of mutuality; to provide a possibility for acquainting citizens of the Russian Federation and foreign citizens, including specialists in the fields of education, science and culture, with said cultural valuables; and to create favorable conditions for the continuous development of international cooperation in the fields of education, science and culture\\". International criticism The Law enacted by the Russian Federation on displaced cultural valuables, has been nothing but criticized on an international level. A Hungarian specialist cited a large number of issues on how the Russian law violates international law and treaties. But more specifically, emphasized that Hungary is entitled to the restitution of Hungarian property removed to the USSR as a result of the Second World War. Further, similar feelings were expressed by a Ukrainian specialist, who argues that Ukraine and other former Soviet republics should have a say in determining the fate of their cultural valuables, on the basis of international norms and democratic principles. A specific criticism of the law is the notion of a limitation period. This is the idea that a claim must be made within 18 months of the information about a specific cultural valuable is published in an appropriate federal agency publication. This strikes a lot of concerns because who decides and what is an adequate publication, and after the 18 months what happens. In 2009, a Ministry of Culture legal specialist wrote that the passage of the law \\"would appear as a unilateral Russian rejection of its international obligations and evoke a negative impact on international relations of the Russian Federation with various European governments\\". Recently, in June 2013, news reports illustrate that the controversy about the appropriation of German artefacts by the USSR, is still on going between Germany's Angela Merkel and Russia's Vladimir Putin. During a visit in St-Petersburg, Angela Merkel, chancellor of Germany, criticized an exhibition at the Hermitage Museum that contained a number of valuables that were stolen from Germany. President Putin declared that the issue is very sensitive and that both sides would continue to talk to resolve the issue.

Chabad Hasidic philosophy focuses on religious concepts such as God, the soul, and the meaning of the Jewish commandments. Teachings are often drawn from classical Judaic teachings and Jewish mysticism. Classical Judaic writings and Jewish mysticism, especially the Zohar and the Kabbalah of Rabbi Isaac Luria, are frequently cited in Chabad works. These texts are used both as sources for Chabad teachings as well as material requiring interpretation by Chabad authors. While Chabad was founded by Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, Chabad philosophy is based on the teachings of Baal Shem Tov (founder of Hasidism) and the Magid of Mezritch (the Baal Shem Tov's successor and Rabbi Shneur Zalman's teacher and mentor). The teachings of Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, the first Chabad Rebbe, form the basis of Chabad philosophy. Rabbi Shneur Zalman's teachings were greatly expanded upon by succeeding generations of Chabad Rebbes. One of the most central Chabad works is the Tanya by Rabbi Schneur Zalman, and many themes found in the Tanya receive greater treatment in subsequent works.  \\"Chabad\\"  According to Shneur Zalman's work Tanya, the intellect consists of three interconnected processes: Chochma (wisdom), Bina (understanding), and Da'at (knowledge). While other branches of Hasidism focused primarily on the idea that \\"God desires the heart\\", Shneur Zalman argued that God also desires the mind, and that the mind is the \\"gateway\\" to the heart. With the Chabad philosophy, he elevated the mind above the heart, arguing that \\"understanding is the mother of fear and love for God\\".Tanya', Shneur Zalman of Liadi, Chapter 13. According to Jonathan Sacks, in Shneur Zalman's system, Chochma represents \\"the creation in its earliest potentiality; the idea of a finite world as was first born in the divine mind. Binah is the idea conceived in its details, the result of contemplation. Da'at is, as it were, the commitment to creation, the stage at which the idea becomes an active intention.\\"The Encyclopedia of Hasidism, entry: Habad, Jonathan Sacks, pp. 161–164 While in Kabbalah there are clearly delineated levels of holiness, in Hasidism and Chabad philosophy these are grounded in the mundanities of people's inner lives. So in reality — according to the Chabad analogy — Chochma is the birth of an idea in the mind, Binah is the contemplation, and Da'at is the beginning of the actualisation of an idea. Sacks argues that this provided a psychological formulation that enabled the hasid to substantiate his mystical thoughts. \\"This was an important advance because bridging the gap between spiritual insight and daily behaviour had always been a problem for Jewish mysticism.\\" Chabad philosophy argues that man is neither static nor passive nor dependent on others to connect to God. Shneur Zalman rejected all ideas of aristocratic birth and elitism — he argued for meritocracy where all were capable of growth, every Jew — in his view — was capable of becoming a Tzadik.Hasidism: The movement and its masters, Harry M. Rabinowicz, 1988, pp. 83–92, Jason Aronson, London Chabad often contrasted itself with other schools (termed by Chabad thinkers as Chagat) of Hasidism.\\"Chagat\\" is an acronym for \\"Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet\\" (kindness, severity, beauty), the Kabbalistic terms for the three primary emotions. While all Hasidism have a certain focus on the emotions, Chagat saw emotions as a reaction to physical stimuli, such as dancing singing or beauty. Shneur Zalman, on the other hand, taught that the emotions must be led by the mind, and thus the focus of Chabad thought was to be Torah study and prayer rather than esotericism and song. As a Talmudist, Shneur Zalman endeavored to place Kabbalah and Hasidism on a rational basis. In Tanya, he defines his approach as moach shalit al halev (Hebrew: \\"מוח שליט על הלב\\", \\"the brain ruling the heart\\").Tanya, ch. 12 Themes =Prayer= Prayer takes a central place in Chabad philosophy. In the Tanya, the desire to pray is referred to as the \\"desire for life\\". Rabbi Shneur Zalman wrote to one Hasidic community, counselling those who were unable to remain at the synagogue for lengthy prayers, to leave early, rather than disturb the rest of the congregation.Shneur Zalman of Liadi. \\"Kutres Achron: Essay 8\\". Tanya. Kehot Publication Society. Brooklyn: New York. =Contemplation= A central position in Chabad philosophy is the notion that the ultimate service of God can be achieved through contemplation and other cognitive processes, rather than through emotions. Chabad philosophy differs from the teachings of other Hasidic groups in this regard, placing greater emphasis on the use of the mind's cognitive faculties in religious devotional efforts.\\"Chabad\\" is a kabbalistic acronym for the names of these cognitive faculties.Weiner, Hebert, 9½ Mystics (). Chabad philosophy provides a conceptual approach to understanding God and other spiritual matters, maintaining that contemplating such topics constitutes Avodat Hashem (\\"the service of God\\").Stroll, Avrum, ‘Encyclopaedia Judaica’’, Second Edition, Volume 18 pages 503–505 (). Chabad philosophy also incorporated the teachings of Kabbalah as a means to deal with one's daily life and psyche. It teaches that every aspect of the world exists only through the intervention of God. Through an intellectual approach and meditations, Chabad teaches that one can attain complete control over one's actions. = Torah study = Shneur Zalman fought against the perception that was prevalent in the early years of Hasidism that the movement neglected Talmudic study by focusing too heavily on mysticism and obscurantism. He emphasized that mysticism without Talmudic study was worthless — even dangerous. Without Talmudic study, he argued, the mind could never be elevated — and if the mind is not elevated, the soul will starve. On the other hand, he argued that while Torah was to be the focus of all study, it was also important to integrate the Torah's teachings into one's life. In a letter to Joshua Zeitlin of Shklow, Shneur Zalman wrote: \\"The Hasidim, too, set aside time for study. The difference between them and the Misnagdim is this: the latter set time for study and they are limited by time, whereas the former make the Torah their path of life.\\" Shneur Zalman taught that Torah must be studied joyously – studying without joy is frowned upon. He provided a metaphor: when a mitzvah is fulfilled an angel is created. But if the mitzvah was joyless then the angel too will be dispirited. Thus, while Shneur Zalman emphasized that Hasidism focus on traditional Jewish scholarship rather than on mysticism, he was emphatic that this must be done with zeal and joy. Bible stories Rabbi Shneur Zalman stated that in the bible, lofty teachings are transcribed in the form of stories. Rabbi Shneur Zalman quotes an unnamed source, stating that studying such biblical episodes simply as stories does not constitute the fulfillment of the Jewish commandment of \\"Torah study\\".Shneur Zalman of Liadi. \\"Inyan Shene'emar B'imaot\\". Ma'amari Admur Hazoken: Parshiot v'Moadim. Vol 1. Kehot Publication Society. Brooklyn: New York. (1983):168. Available on HebrewBooks.org =Kabbalah= In Chabad thought, the study of Kabbalah is seen, in some instances, not only as an act of religious study, but as a way to fulfill other Jewish commandments. In the Tanya, the study of Kabbalah is divided between the study of Seder Hishtalshelus (the Kabbalistic theory of the evolution of the universe), and the study of the esoteric meaning of the commandments. The study of the commandments is said to be a superior form of study, because it relates more closely to the performance of mitzvoth, and in some cases, is considered to take the place of the commandment itself.Shneur Zalman of Liadi. \\"Kutres Achron: Essay 4\\". Tanya. Kehot Publication Society. Brooklyn: New York. =Seder Hishtalshelus= Seder Hishtalshelus (), meaning \\"Order of Development/Evolution\\", refers in Kabbalah and Hasidic thought to the chain- like descent of Spiritual Worlds (Olam/Olamot) between God and Creation. Each spiritual Olam-World denotes a complete realm of existence, resulting from its general proximity or distance to Divine revelation. Each realm is also a form of consciousness reflected in this World through the psychology of the soul. The concept of Seder Hishtalshelus is explored in numerous Chabad philosophical works. =Love of God= According to Rabbi Shneur Zalman, there are two main forms of human love for God. One form, called the \\"natural love\\", is one that is brought about through the subjection of bodily drives, the other, \\"produced love\\", is the result of contemplation on topics which arouse such emotions.Shneur Zalman of Liadi. \\"Sha'ar Yichud V'emuna: Introduction\\". Tanya. Kehot Publication Society. Brooklyn: New York. =Love of one's fellow Jew= Ahavat Yisrael (Hebrew: אהבת ישראל, \\"love for one’s fellow Jew\\") is a biblical precept,“Love your fellow like yourself” (Leviticus 19:18). greatly elaborated in Chabad thought.Schneersohn, Shalom Dovber. \\"Maamar Heichaltzu\\". Chabad.org.Shneur Zalman of Liadi. \\"Lekuttei Amarim Tanya: Chapter 32\\". Tanya. Kehot Publication Society. Brooklyn: New York. In the Tanya, Rabbi Shneur Zalman states that the obligation to love one's fellow Jew extends even to sinners. =Charity= In Chabad thought, charity is seen not only as a physical act of giving, but as a conduit for spiritual enlightenment. In the Tanya, giving charity is said to draw inspiration and bring about humility.Shneur Zalman of Liadi. \\"Kutres Achron: Essay 7\\". Tanya. Kehot Publication Society. Brooklyn: New York. = Unity = Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson advanced, in his writings and lectures, a proposed unity between opposing concepts. He proposed that it was possible to unite the mundane aspects of the world with the aspect of \\"godliness\\" in the world. Schneerson emphasized the significance of creating an \\"abode for God on this world\\". Consequently, he encouraged his followers to unite a life in the modern world with the teachings of Judaism. He felt that the world was not a contradiction to the word of God, and it was to be embraced rather than shunned. Schneerson taught that the use of modern technology does not necessarily contradict a life of spirituality. For that reason, Chabad has consistently utilized modern technology to spread its message. Since its inception, Chabad have used the radio, and later television, satellite feeds, and the Internet to spread its message. =Dirah Betachtonim= Dira Betachtonim () is the process of manifesting the presence of God within the world. An examination of Dirah Betachtonim is found in Samech Vov by the fifth Chabad Rebbe, Rabbi Sholom Dovber Schneersohn. In Samech Vov, this concept is described as the ultimate purpose of creation.Paltiel, Yosef Y. Samech Vav. Inside Chassidus. insidechassidus.org. Accessed April 1, 2014. Dirah Betachtonim is also explored by the seventh Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel. Central to the Dirah Betachtonim concept is the notion of sublimating the physical aspects of existence.Levin, Faitel. A Synopsis of the Dirah Betachtonim System. Chabad.org. Accessed April 15, 2014. = Bitul Hayesh = In Chabad philosophy, yeshut (\\"selfhood\\" or \\"self-assertion\\") is seen as the antithesis to yichud (\\"unity\\"), a denial of the reality that God \\"fills the heavens and the earth\\" and that there is none besides Him. Bitul Hayesh means total self- negation and a conscious awareness of the ultimate nature of man.Schochet, J. Immanuel. The Mystical Dimension. Kehot Publication Society. 1990. Pages 50-52. Bitul Hayesh is achieved by one's reflection on God's greatness, exaltedness and majesty. For when one feels that they are in the presence of God, they will feel a sense of insignificance and humility. And at the same time, the worshipper will feel a passionate adoration for God, and a desire to cleave to God.Mindel, Nissan. The Divine Commandments. Kehot Publication Society. 1992. Page 12. = Moshiach = In Chabad theology, the concept of messianism (משיח - moshiach) is discussed at length. The seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, taught that the concept of moshiach is linked to the fifth and highest level of the soul, the yechidah (the soul's essence). He explains that just like the yechidah of a soul is that soul's quintessential point, the same is true with moshiach, which is a revelation of Godliness that transcends all limitations. Hence, in the times of moshiach, the world will be filled with the level of yechidah, perfecting and completing this world. Other concepts A number of other important concepts in Chabad philosophy are referenced in scattered locations in Chabad literature. Though these topics were discussed in brief and were not the focus of any major work, new insights have been drawn from their treatment in Chabad thought. =Roles of Rebbe and Hasid= In its earlier formulations, Hasidic thought had elevated the rebbe to a level above that of typical hasid. A rebbe was closer to God, his prayers were more amenable to Him, and a hasid should satisfy himself with attachment to the Rebbe and hence indirectly to God. A rebbe was to be a living example of perfection and would concern himself with intellectualism on behalf of the followers. According to Sacks, Chabad stressed the individual responsibilities of every Jew: \\"The rebbe...became more of a teacher and adviser, recognising the vocation of each of his followers, guiding them towards it, uncovering their strengths, and rejoicing in their achievements.\\" In Chabad thought, the Rebbe is not an intermediary between the Hasid and God. Rather, the role of the rebbe was to train followers to become spiritually self-sufficient and to turn to their Rebbe for instructions rather than intercession with God, miracles or blessings. Hasidism traditionally demanded that every Hasid personally participate in the dissemination of Torah and Judaism to one's surroundings and seek out the benefit of one's fellow Jew. Rabbi Sholom Dovber Schneersohn said: A Hasid is he who surrenders himself for the benefit of another.Sefer Hasichos 5700 p. 33 Beyond this, Chabad demands pnimiyut (inwardness / sincerity): one should not act superficially, as a mere act of faith, but rather with inner conviction.The Mystical Dimension vol. 3 by Jacob Emanuel Schochet. Kehot Publication Society 1995 p.198.() The relationship the Chabad Hasid has with the Rebbe is called hiskashrus. Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn stated, \\"A bond with me (hiskashrus) is made by studying my ma'amorim of Hasidut, by fulfilling my request concerning the daily recital of Tehillim, and the like.\\"HaYom Yom, entry for 24 Sivan; et al.Kaploun Uri. \\"The Gashmiyus of a Rebbe\\". Chabad.org. http://chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/96057/jewish/The-Gashmiyus-of-a- Rebbe.htm In a continuation of longstanding Chabad tradition, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson demanded that each individual exert themselves in advancing spiritually, and not rely on the Rebbe to do it for them.Toras Menachem vol. 2 p. 212–213 Major texts = Tanya = Sefer HaTanya, Shneur Zalman's magnum opus, is the first schematic treatment of Hasidic moral philosophy and its metaphysical foundations. The original name of the first book is Sefer Shel Beinonim, the \\"Book of the Intermediates.\\" It is also known as Likutei Amarim — \\"Collected Sayings.\\" Sefer Shel Beinonim analyzes the inner struggle of the individual and the path to resolution. Citing the biblical verse \\"the matter is very near to you, in your mouth, your heart, to do\\",Deuturonomy 30:14. the philosophy is based on the notion that the human is not inherently evil; rather, every individual has an inner conflict that is characterized with two different inclinations, the good and the bad.The Encyclopedia of Hasidism, entry: Tanya, Jonathan Sacks, pp. 475–477 (15682–11236) Some have argued that Shneur Zalman's moderation and synthesis saved the general Hasidic movement from breaking away from Orthodox Judaism. It allowed for mystically inclined Hasidim to be familiarized with traditional Jewish scholarship and observance, and for traditionalists to access Hasidism within the framework of Jewish scholarship.The Messiah of Brooklyn: Understanding Lubavitch Hasidim Past and Present, M.
