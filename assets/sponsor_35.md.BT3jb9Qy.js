It took place 7 minutes after midnight on 26 January 1985, and had a magnitude of 6.2 in the Richter scale. Its epicenter was located about 45 km southwest of Mendoza, the provincial capital, at the southern end of the region's pre-Andes range, and at a depth of 15 km. It was felt as grade VIII in the Mercalli intensity scale. The earthquake caused 6 deaths and about 100 injuries. In the affected Greater Mendoza area, where most of the provincial population is concentrated, one third of the buildings were built of adobe. Some 23,000 homes were destroyed or condemned, though the actual number might have been larger. Estimates vary between 50,000 and 100,000 people left homeless. A report released soon afterwards stated that the main reason why the event did not produce thousands of casualties was its short duration (less than 10 seconds). In addition, the fact that it was a summer Friday night might have led many people to be sitting outside their homes, chatting with their neighbors, rather than sleeping inside.

Background British rock band Felt broke-up in 1989, while frontman Lawrence had been living in Brighton. Finding Brighton to be unpleasant, he moved to New York in early 1990.Wilkinson 2005, p. 122 Lawrence soon started to reminisce about his childhood in the 1970s. He proceeded to visit a pawn shop and buy a guitar, which he would use to compose Back in Denim. He eventually grew homesick and soon moved to London. Lawrence formed Denim with a variety of \\"session men and ageing glitter-rockers\\", according to Rough Guides editor Peter Buckley.Buckley, ed. 2003, p. 369 Lawrence had been receiving calls from major labels, but decided to sign with dance-oriented record label Boy's Own Recordings, who had signed a distribution deal with London Records. His decision to sign with them was based on his notion that \\"rock music was finished, and DJs could get our records into the charts.\\" Production and composition While Felt's albums were recorded with a minuscule budget for small independent labels, Lawrence had \\"the chance to make the album I'd always wanted\\" for a major label. Between May 1990 and July 1992, Back in Denim was recorded and mixed with producer John Leckie. At one point, Lawrence was banned from the studio and had pushed Leckie to breaking point, which resulted in him exclaiming: \\"I've worked with Phil Spector and John Lennon and Syd Barrett, but I can't take this any more. You're madder than any of them.\\" Eventually, before threatening to disown the recordings, he finished the proceedings with Brian O'Shaughnessy. The amount of money that went into making the album had made Boy's Own Recordings go bankrupt. The album's sound has been described as glam rock and pop. Tim Sendra of AllMusic claimed that for Back in Denim, Lawrence \\"channeled his love of simple punk, huge hooks, novelty songs, and slagging everyone\\". Mojo review Roy Wilkinson commented that the album's \\"wistful examination of Britain and knowing adoption of pop styles from other eras\\" laid the groundwork for Britpop. The album was complete with \\"glam and pop hooks machined to perfection with the best in 1990s recording science\\". \\"Middle of the Road\\" features a sample of Middle of the Road's version of \\"Chirpy Chirpy Cheep Cheep\\". Release and reception It was released in November 1992 on Boy's Own Recordings. London Records wanted to release the album's title track as a single, but Lawrence requested to re-recording the song's chorus, to which London Records cut funding for further studio time. \\"Middle of the Road\\" was released as a single, with the B-sides \\"Ape Hangers\\", \\"Robin's Nest\\", and an instrumental version of \\"Ape Hangers\\" titled \\"The Great Grape Ape-Hangers\\", in January 1993. The album was received well by critics but was commercially poor. In retrospect, Lawrence commented \\"The tills were closed. [...] This was my masterpiece and I would fight to death to get it right. If that meant it was going to end up selling 25 copies, then that was the way it had to be.\\" The album was reissued in May 2006 on West Midland's Records, a subsidiary of Cherry Red. Norwegian band Turbonegro covered \\"Back in Denim\\" as a bonus track at 2007 album Retox. In 2017, Pitchfork ranked Back in Denim at number 50 in their list of \\"The 50 Best Britpop Albums\\".

Humans Sesamoiditis occurs on the bottom of the foot, just behind the big toe. There are normally two sesamoid bones on each foot; sometimes sesamoids can be bipartite, which means they each comprise two separate pieces. The sesamoids are roughly the size of jelly beans. The sesamoid bones act as a fulcrum for the flexor tendons, the tendons which bend the big toe downward. Symptoms include inflammation and pain. Sometimes a sesamoid bone is fractured. This can be difficult to pick up on X-ray, so a bone scan or MRI is a better alternative. Among those who are susceptible to the malady are dancers, catchers and pitchers in baseball, soccer players, and football players. Horses Location of the sesamoid bones, behind the fetlock. In the horse it occurs at the horse's fetlock. The sesamoid bones lie behind the bones of the fetlock, at the back of the joint, and help to keep the tendons and ligaments that run between them correctly functioning. Usually periostitis (new bone growth) occurs along with sesamoiditis, and the suspensory ligament may also be affected. Sesamoiditis results in inflammation, pain, and eventually bone growth. Causes In humans, excessive forces caused by sudden bending upwards of the big toe, high heels, or a stumble can contribute to sesamoiditis. Once the sesamoid bone is injured it can be very difficult to cure, because every time you walk you put additional pressure on the sesamoid bone. Treatment in humans consists of anti-inflammatory medication, cortisone injections, strapping to immobilize the big toe, and orthotics with special accommodations to keep pressure off the affected bone. In horses, sesamoiditis is generally caused by excess stress on the fetlock joint. Conformation that promotes sesamoiditis include long pasterns, or horses with long toes and low heels.

He is known as Guilherme in Brazil and Gui Finkler in Australia and New Zealand. Early life Finkler was born in Caxias do Sul in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul in 1985. Finkler has a wife, Karine, and daughter, Rafaela. Club career=Early career Finkler played for Brazilian side Juventude, scoring four times in 15 appearances in the 2006 season. Upon returning from a loan spell at Cianorte he played in three further matches in 2007. Finkler's subsequent Brazilian club was Juventude's city rival, Caxias. England and Belgium Finkler had a spell in Europe during the 2006‚Äì07 season, when he had a trial at the then English Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers. He impressed enough during pre- season games, scoring several goals, that the club took up a season-long loan option. However, he never made a first team appearance in competitive games. After failing to stake a claim in the side, his loan was cut short in January 2007 by mutual consent. Finkler continued his stay in Europe by seeing out the 2006‚Äì07 season on loan at Belgian Pro League side Mouscron. Melbourne Victory Finkler signed for Melbourne Victory on 22 June 2012, prior to the 2012‚Äì13 A-League season. =Season 2012‚Äì2013= Finkler made his debut for the Victory in round 1 against crosstown rivals Melbourne Heart. After playing regularly for the Victory, Finkler suffered a season-ending injury in round 12 against A-League debutant club Western Sydney Wanderers, when his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) was ruptured in a heavy tackle. Finkler would return to frustrate Western Sydney but the ACL damage required surgery in a new country, with a new language, and rehabilitation for nearly a year. Until his injury, Finkler had been leading the A-League season 2012/13 assists count with eight. He made his return to football in the 2013‚Äì14 season. =Season 2013‚Äì2014= Gui Finkler training with Melbourne Victory in 2013. Finkler made substitute appearances in the opening 0‚Äì0 draw with Melbourne Heart and in round 2 away to Adelaide. Finkler scored his first goal for Melbourne Victory (also Victory's first goal of the season) in a 2‚Äì2 draw against Adelaide United. After the disruption of Ange Postecoglou's departure in the following weeks to coach the Australian national side, assistant-turned- manager Kevin Muscat continued to use Finkler off the bench, only bringing him on for the final 10‚Äì25 minutes of matches to build up match fitness and strengthen his post-operation knee. His corners from the right-hand side being the highlight of his brief appearances, as well as free kicks. After a dispiriting home loss to Newcastle Jets, Victory hosted Perth Glory on Friday 13 December 2013. Guilherme came off the bench for the final 17 minutes and scored his first ever home goal following Adama Traore's solitary goal of the season,http://m.foxsports.com.au/football/a-league/adama-traore-and-gui- finkler-score-goals-as-melbourne-victory-overcome-perth- glory-20/story-e6frf4gl-1226782739293 to make it 2‚Äì0 and seal the match, with a classy move. The final derby with John Aloisi in charge of the Heart took place with both teams desperate for a win. Heart had not won a match since a 3‚Äì1 win over Sydney in February 2013, and Victory to try to stay in the top 5. Again Finkler named on the bench. Troisi scored a goal and was subbed for Finkler after just under an hour, and Finkler laid up Mitch Nichols with a sublime pass to put Victory 3‚Äì0 up against the 10-man Heart, and gift Nichols his first, and last brace at Melbourne Victory ‚Äì days later J-League club Cerezo Osaka managed by Australian Ranko Popovic increased its offer for Nichols to $325k from $200k. Victory eventually sold him at the 3rd bid, on 6/1/2014, for AUD$400k ‚Äì double the initial offer, and with a clause that would benefit Victory financially if Cerezo re-sold him. This and Finkler's improvement after returning from injury led to more time on the pitch and a regular starting XI place. Finkler scored against Western Sydney Wanderers with a free kick taken at the end of the match to save the game for the Victory. Melbourne Victory coach Kevin Muscat and Western Sydney Wanderers coach Tony Popovic both praised the goal, which was taken from close to the same spot that Finkler had used an earlier free kick from to cross the ball in. These tactics were not working, and with Finkler taking several corners from the RHS, it was unlikely the Wanderers defence would be breached with a cross. Deep into injury time, Victory won a free kick 30 yards from goal, taken by Finkler. He decided not to curve the ball in to the smaller Victory forward line to be again cleared by the WSW defense, and took Ante Covic the WSW keeper, as well as many teammates and the opposition defence by surprise by having a shot and scoring a memorable goal to draw the match, ending a pattern of home defeats by WSW. On Saturday 4 January 2014, Guilherme Finkler was named in the Melbourne Victory starting XI for the first time since his knee injury sustained exactly one year and one day prior. his knee for his club's match against Brisbane Roar. He was subbed off after just over an hour against league leaders Brisbane Roar, with the score 0‚Äì1, when Victory had a defender sent off. On 14 January 2014, Finkler appeared as a substitute for Andrew Nabbout after 19 minutes in a game against Western Sydney. The match lasted for longer than most, with two drinks breaks per half due to the heatwave that was over Melbourne (which affected working conditions in several professions, and other sports including the Australian Open, seeing compulsory breaks in play). Finkler scored his fourth goal for the season in the 90th(+6) minute to make the score 3‚Äì1 to his tem. On 22 February, Finkler scored two goals and played a full match for the first time in the season as the game against Adelaide United finished 4‚Äì3 in his club's favour. Finkler scored his club's first penalty of the season against Perth on New Year's Eve, 2013, in the absence of the previous season's penalty taker Mark Milligan. In the final home and away match, in Wellington on 12 April 2014, Finkler provided an assist and scored his 8th goal of seasonhttps://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/12/melbourne-victory- wellington-phoenix-a-league in a chain of passes described by FoxSports commentary as a Master class.

Rossman (June 17, 1881 ‚Äì January 16, 1928) was an American baseball player. He played professional baseball for 12 years from 1903 to 1914, principally as first baseman, including five years in Major League Baseball with the Cleveland Naps (1904, 1906), Detroit Tigers (1907‚Äì1909) and St. Louis Browns (1909). He appeared in 511 major league games and compiled a .283 batting average and a .318 on-base percentage. Early years Rossman was born in Philmont, New York, in 1881. Professional baseball Rossman began playing professional baseball in 1903 in the Connecticut League and was with Holyoke in 1903 and 1904. He was drafted by the Cleveland Naps but was sent to the Naps' minor league team in Des Moines in 1905. Rossman finally made it to the major leagues in September 1904, playing 16 games in right field for the Naps in the closing weeks of the season. Rossman did not play in the majors in 1905 but won a spot as the Naps' starting first baseman in 1906. He hit .308 in 118 games with 53 RBIs. Rossman's .308 average in was 8th best in the American League and third highest among the Cleveland regulars‚Äîtrailing two Hall of Famers, Nap Lajoie and Elmer Flick. In December 1906, the Naps sold Rossman to the Detroit Tigers. With Ty Cobb and Sam Crawford already in the Detroit lineup, the addition of manager Hughie Jennings and Rossman in 1907 gave the Tigers the spark they needed to win three straight American League pennants from 1907 to 1909. Claude Rossman, Cleveland Indians Rossman had a good season for the Tigers in 1907, playing 153 games at first base. He was among the 1907 American League leaders in RBIs (69), hits (158), total bases (195) and runs created (62). Rossman also excelled in the 1907 World Series, batting .474 with a .579 slugging percentage, 9 hits, 2 RBIs and a run. Unfortunately for the Tigers, their two biggest hitting stars, Ty Cobb and Sam Crawford, did not come through, hitting .200 and .238 respectively. Rossman had as many hits and triples in the 1907 World Series as Cobb and Crawford combined. In , Rossman had the best year of his career. Rossman was among the American League leaders in most batting categories: 2nd in dobules with 33 (trailing only Ty Cobb); 3rd in total bases with 219 and extra base hits with 48 (trailing teammates Cobb and Crawford in both categories); 4th in slugging percentage at .418; 5th in RBIs (71), triples (13), and OPS (.748); and 6th in batting average at .294. In the 1908 World Series, Rossman had two hits and 3 RBIs in another losing effort to the Chicago Cubs. Batting behind Ty Cobb in the Detroit lineup, Rossman had a useful talent for laying down bunts. Rossman was so proficient at bunting that Cobb was regularly able to streak from first to third base on Rossman's bunts. On August 20, 1909, with Rossman batting .261 in his third season in Detroit, the Tigers traded him to the St. Louis Browns for Tom Jones. Rossman played in only 2 games for the Browns, his last major league game occurring on September 3, 1909. Rossman continued to play professionally in the American Association after leaving the Browns. First with Columbus in 1910 and later that season with Minneapolis, where he continued to play until 1914. Rossman had a peculiar emotional quirk where he sometimes froze and could not throw the ball when he became excited. Runners would lead off first to draw a throw from the pitcher, then run to second when Rossman froze.The Ballplayers ‚Äì Claude Rossman  BaseballLibrary.com at www.baseballlibrary.com Rossman had excellent range as a first baseman. His career Range factor of 11.06 at first base was almost 2.00 full points above the average for first baseman of his era. But his propensity to freeze with the ball in his throwing hand is said to have greatly shortened his career. He was 28 when he played his last major league game. In 511 major league games, Rossman hit .283 with 523 hits, 238 RBI, 175 runs, 109 extra base hits, and 49 stolen bases. Later years Rossman died at age 46 in Poughkeepsie, New York, while residing as a patient at the Hudson River State Hospital for the Insane where he had been a patient for several years. He was buried at an unknown cemetery in Philmont, New York.

Career=Texas Rangers Byrd was drafted out of El Capitan High School in Lakeside, California in the second round of the 1974 MLB Draft by the Texas Rangers. He turned pro in 1974, playing with the Rangers Gulf Coast League team, earning a 4-1 record and an ERA of 2.87 in nine starts. In 1975, Byrd moved up to the Anderson Rangers of the Western Carolinas League, in which he had a 7-11 record in 22 starts for the club. The following season in 1976, the Rangers moved Byrd up to AA baseball, where he joined the San Antonio Brewers of the Texas League, where Byrd once again posted a 7-11 record, however his ERA went up to 5.22, as well as 106 walks in 143 innings pitched. On November 5, 1976, Byrd was left unprotected in the 1976 MLB Expansion Draft, where the Toronto Blue Jays selected him with the 21st pick in the draft. Toronto Blue Jays The Blue Jays, an expansion team in 1977, did not have a AA team affiliated with their club that season. Instead, they sent Byrd to the Cleveland Indians AA team in the Eastern League, the Jersey City Indians. Byrd had a poor record of 1-4, however, he had a very solid ERA of 3.13 in ten games with the club. The Blue Jays promoted Byrd to Major League Baseball in June of that season. Byrd made his major league debut on June 20, 1977, when he started a game against the Cleveland Indians at Exhibition Stadium. At 20 years old, Byrd became the youngest Blue Jay pitcher to start a game, a distinction he holds to this day. Byrd pitched five innings, allowing three runs, while striking out four hitters, as Toronto lost to Cleveland 6-5. Byrd earned a no-decision in the contest. On June 25, Byrd made his second career start, pitching 7.1 innings, allowing four runs, and took the loss as the Baltimore Orioles defeated Toronto 5-2. In his fourth career start, Byrd pitched six innings, allowing three runs, as Toronto won over Cleveland 5-3 at Cleveland Municipal Stadium, and Byrd earned his first career victory. Byrd would struggle for the rest of the season, picking up only 2 wins in a total of 17 starts. His season ended on a particularly dismal note, as he lost each of his final nine starts, and pitched in only 0.2 innings in his final start, allowing five runs to the Boston Red Sox. Byrd finished the year (and, it turned out, his major league career) with a 2-13 record, and an ERA of 6.18. At the end of spring training 1978, the Blue Jays assigned Byrd to their AAA affiliate, the Syracuse Chiefs of the International League. He complained to the press when he was sent down to Triple-A that his minor league salary was less than what he could make doing construction work. At Syracuse, Byrd had a disastrous time of it, making seven starts and posting a 0-3 record and an ERA of 8.13. When the Blue Jays decided to further demote Bryd to Double-A after his poor start in Syracuse, he abruptly left the Blue Jays organization and‚Äîproving his point about his minimal minor league baseball salary‚Äîspent the rest of the year working at a construction site. Byrd rejoined the team for spring training, 1979, declaring that the previous year was \\"water under the bridge\\". However, the Blue Jays released Byrd on March 29, 1979. Seattle Mariners In 1979, Byrd spent the season with the San Jose Missions of the California League, which was the Seattle Mariners A level affiliate. Byrd posted a solid record of 12-6 with an ERA of 2.98 in 26 starts. However, wildness continued to be a problem, as in 151 innings, Byrd walked 117 batters, hit 15 others, and threw 17 wild pitches. Byrd ended his career after that season.

They belong to the main lineage of case-constructing caddisflies, the Integripalpia or tube-case caddisflies. The Limnephilidae is one of the most species-rich Trichoptera families of northern temperate regions, but only a few are known from tropical areas and the Southern Hemisphere. For this reason they are often known as northern caddisflies. Description and ecology The adults are usually brown in colour, often with narrow mottled or patterned forewings and much broader, transparent hindwings. The aquatic larvae construct portable cases from a wide variety of plant and mineral materials, sometimes even snail shells. Cases of young larvae often looking completely different from those of larger instars. Larvae tend to be eruciform (with a thickset head and thorax), rather slow-moving, and usually feed by browsing algae or scavenging animal remains. They pupate within the larval case, the pupa swimming to the surface before flying away as an adult. For most species the life cycle is completed within one year. The family includes one extraordinary aberrant genus, Enoicyla, whose larvae are terrestrial, living among moss and leaf litter. The females of Enoicyla have only vestigial wings and are flightless.

His life and work Praetorius was born in Salzwedel, Margraviate of Brandenburg. He was educated at the University of Rostock, where he also taught in the local schools; was ordained by Agricola at Berlin in 1565; became preacher in the same year at the monastery of the Holy Ghost at Salzwedel, and soon after deacon of the Church of St. Mary's; and from 1569 until his death was pastor in Salzwedel. A great admirer of Martin Luther, and an opponent of Jesuitism and Calvinism alike, Praetorius laid great stress on the sacraments, though not in the Roman Catholic sense, and held to justification by faith, though he also insisted on purity of life. He was a precursor of Johann Arndt and Philipp Jakob Spener, though not Pietist in the narrow sense. His lack of caution brought upon him the charges of antinomianism and perfectionism, the latter theory later even being called Praetorianism. Through his tracts, which he or his friends published after 1570, Praetorius exercised an influence far beyond his own congregation; these were collected and published by Arndt under the title Acht-und-f√ºnfzig sch√∂ne, auserlesne, geist- und trostreiche Trakt√§tlein (L√ºneburg, 1622), containing also fourteen hymns with their melodies, one of them being \\"Was hat gethan der heilige Christ?\\" Praetorius' tracts were later arranged in the form of dialogues, with certain moderations, by M. Statius in his Geistliche Schatzkammer der Gl√§ubigen (L√ºneburg, 1636, and often). There arose over his writings the Praetorian controversy, Abraham Calovius assailing the view of Praetorius and Statius that the faithful possess salvation not only in prospect but in reality. Spener's antagonist, G. C. Dilfeld, considered Praetorius akin to Esaias Stiefel, and the general superintendent of Greifswald, Tiburtius Rango, secured the prohibition of the Schatzkammer in Swedish Pomerania. Despite all this, Praetorius' writings were continually read, and in the second quarter of the 17th century they influenced a circle of converts in Cottbus and its vicinity. Spener frequently alludes to him admiringly, and the Schatzkammer has been revised by the Kornthal pastor J. H. Stoudt (Stuttgart, 1869).

Ivan Ivanovich Krasnov was educated at the boarding-school by Kharkov University. He began military service in 1816 at the Life Guards of the Cossacks Regiment. Three years later, he was promoted to the rank of aide-de- camp to Vasily Orlov-Denisov, commander of the 2nd Cavalry Corps. He participated at the Russo-Turkish War, 1828‚Äì1829, and subdued the Polish rebels during the November Uprising in 1831. Afterwards, he returned home to the Don Voisko Province. In 1838, Ivan Krasnov was elected the director of the board of the Don Cossack Voisko and assistant to the Ataman for civil affairs.

It is one of the largest high schools in New York State, and is located in Suffolk County, Long Island. History=1951‚Äì1970 The first class to graduate from Brentwood High School was the class of 1957. Prior to this, public school students in the district attended Bay Shore High School. The physical brick and mortar structure had not yet been built. Brentwood High School began with the Ross Building, with its tennis courts and state of the art swimming pool. In 1961 Dr. Eugene G. Hoyt, then the District Principal, and Dr. Raymond Scheele of Hofstra University, presented a plan for curriculum development to Dr. Meade of the Ford Foundation. On the basis of this work, the foundation awarded Brentwood High School (with Hofstra as the \\"cooperating university\\") a grant of more than $300,000 for curriculum development. The Sonderling Building was completed and open for students in September 1964. It was named for the then-President of the Board of Education, Edward Sonderling. During the summer of 1968 (in compliance with the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968), temporary portable classrooms were constructed between the Ross and Sonderling Buildings, housing the language and health classes. The Guy di Pietro Building was later constructed between the two main buildings and named in honor of the late Social Studies (1963-1967) Department Chairman (1967-1972), who became the Superintendent of Schools in 1973, and remained so until his death in 1985.http://www.robsny.org/News/InMemorium/InMemorium.html (G. Guy Di Pietro, second scroll) On January 11, 1968, then-Senator Robert F. Kennedy visited Brentwood High School and spoke to 800+ students, parents and faculty in the Sonderling auditorium. After giving a short address, he opened the floor to questions and asked his own questions of the audience. 1970‚Äì1980 June 27, 1971 was the last Brentwood senior class to graduate all together as one 1,400 body of students enjoying the now demolished Commack Arena as the commencement site. By June 1973 the separation between BHS Ross and BHS Sonderling was complete. The class of 1973 had 2 separate graduations; Ross building was at 1pm, and Sonderling was at 5pm in the afternoon. The total graduating class from 1973 was approximately 1200 students. The commencement ceremonies were held on the athletic field on June 23rd, 1973. From 1974 to 1989, the student body was large enough that the two primary buildings, Ross and Sonderling, were treated as two distinct high schools. Students from North Middle School and West Middle School went to Sonderling, while students from East Middle School and South Middle School went to Ross.

The name of the title is taken from the fortress town of Belmonte in Calabria, historically important for the defence of the Italian coast from Saracen invasion. Belmonte has been known since the Risorgimento as Belmonte Calabro. In addition to the princely title, the princes were made Grandees of Spain (First Class) in 1712, and in 1726 were granted the rank of Prince of the Holy Roman Empire () with the style of Serene Highness (). The princes hold a number of subsidiary titles, including Duke of Acerenza (1593), Marquess of Galatone (1562) and Count of Copertino (1562). The seat of the princes is Palazzo Belmonte, on the Bay of Salerno and south of Amalfi. The princes are descendants of the Fieschi family of Genoa, who were ennobled as Counts Palatine in the year 1010 by Henry the Holy, King of Italy and later Holy Roman Emperor. The Emperor created the title of Count of Lavagna and appointed the Fieschi as Imperial Vice-Regents of all Tuscany and of the coast of Genoa. Ancestry The Princes of Belmonte descended from the Fieschi, Counts Palatine of Lavagna. The Fieschi were one of the main families of Genoa, along with the Grimaldi, Spinola and Doria families. In the 13th century, the Fieschi were allied to the House of Grimaldi, modern day Princes of Monaco, in the struggle between the Guelphs and Ghibellines. The current prince is 35th in line from Frisco, 1st Count of Lavagna. The ancestors of the Princes of Belmonte include Sinibaldo, Pope Innocent IV, and Ottobuono, Pope Adrian V, as well as several cardinals, a King of Sicily, the Viceroy of Naples under Ren√© I of Naples (Jacopo Fieschi), three saints including Saint Catherine of Genoa (1447‚Äì1510), and both generals and admirals of Genoa and other states. Through their later marriage to a line of the Pignatelli, the Princes of Belmonte share blood with a third pope, Pope Innocent XII, and the Jesuit Saint Joseph Pignatelli. Coin of the Reign of Charles V, Mint of Naples and Aquila, showing IBR. Ugone of Lavagna was alleged to have been the first to bear the name \\"Fiesco\\" or Fieschi, attributed to his control of the fiscal affairs of the Holy Roman Emperor. His descendant, Rubaldo Fieschi, was confirmed as Count of Lavagna in the 11th Century. Around 1156, Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor confirmed feudal rights in Lavagna to the Fieschi: the beneficiaries included Rubaldo and his nephews Gulielmo, Tebaldo, Enrico, Ruffino, Aldedado, Gherardo; Ottone and his brother Ugone; and Alberto and his brother Beltramino. The rank of Count Palatine was confirmed once again at Lucca on 27 May 1369 by Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor of the House of Luxembourg. Later confirmations of the Fieschi status as direct vassals to the Holy Roman Emperor were given by the House of Habsburg in 1521, 1529, 1568, and 1620. Beltramino Fieschi, 7th Count of Lavagna, was succeeded by his son Gerardo Fieschi, 8th Count, who was known as 'Gerardo Ravascherius'. Taking the name Ravaschieri Fieschi, this branch rose to greater prominence as royal bankers in the Kingdom of Naples: Giovanni Battista was appointed Master of the Mint of Naples and Aquila (Maestro di Zecca di Napoli e L'Aquila) in 1552 under His Imperial Majesty Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor (1516‚Äì1554), and his seal of 'IBR' frequently appears on the coinage of that time. Giovanni Battista was one of 7 children, of whom the eldest brother Giovan Francesco, was Prior of Bari of the Order of Malta (died 1555). Germano followed his father as 'Maestro di Zecca', under King Philip II of Spain, and was the father of Giovan Battista, 1st Baron of Badolato, and therefore grandfather of Orazio, the first Prince Belmonte. The princely title of Belmonte has descended to its present holder through the following houses: Ravaschieri Fieschi, Squarciafico Pinelli, and Pignatelli y Aymerich. The heiress of the last of these married the Marquess of Castellabate, uniting her lands and titles with those of the Granito family, patricians of Salerno (Seggio di Campo) since 1380.

In bookbinding, a dos-√†-dos binding ( or , from the French for \\"back-to-back\\") is a binding structure in which two separate books are bound together such that the fore edge of one is adjacent to the spine of the other, with a shared lower board between them serving as the back cover of both. When shelved, the spine of the book to the right faces outward, while the spine of the book to the left faces the back of the shelf; the text of both works runs head-to-tail. The dos-√†-dos format dates back at least to the 16th century, though they were most common in England in the first half of the 17th century.Glaister, 144. Two books frequently bound in this form were the New Testament and Psalter, presumably because both were needed during church services. Regardless of content, the outer boards of dos-√†-dos bindings were usually embroidered, or covered with leather and then finished with gold.Glaister, 144; One example is Irvin S. Cobb's Oh! Well! You Know How Women Are! bound dos-√†-dos with Mary Roberts Rinehart's Isn't That Just Like a Man!, as published by George Doran in 1920.Copy description located in second- hand bookstore T√™te-b√™che The term \\"dos-√†-dos\\" is also used to refer to a single volume in which two texts are bound together, with one text rotated 180¬∞ relative to the other, such that when one text runs head-to-tail, the other runs tail-to-head. However, this type of binding is properly termed t√™te-b√™che (/t…õtÀàb…õ É/) (from the French meaning \\"head-to-toe\\", literally referring to a type of bed). Books bound in this way have no back cover, but instead have two front covers and a single spine with two titles. When a reader reaches the end of the text of one of the works, the next page is the (upside-down) last page of the other work. These volumes are also referred to as \\"upside-down books\\" or \\"reversible books\\". The t√™te-b√™che format has been used for devotional books since the nineteenth century, and possibly earlier. It has also been used, for example, to bind two-way language dictionaries, and even for novels. An example is The Loving Couple: His (and Her) Story, a 1956 novel by Patrick Dennis. Here, the books are first-person accounts of a rocky marriage, one narrated by the husband, the other by the wife. The format became widely known in the 1950s, when Ace Books began to publish its Ace Doubles. This was a line of t√™te-b√™che genre paperbacks that ran from 1952 through the early 1970s. The Ace Doubles binding was considered innovative, if gimmicky, at the time; the 18 October 1952 issue of Publishers Weekly describes it as a \\"trick format\\". More recently, the format was used for the 1990 Methuen paperback edition of Monty Python's Flying Circus: Just the Words, a two-volume collection of the scripts of the television series.

Osselets usually occur in the front legs of the horse, because there is more strain and concussion on the fetlock there than in the hind legs. The arthritis will occur at the joint between the cannon bone and large pastern bone, at the front of the fetlock. Definition Osselets refers to the inflammation of the connective tissue that is around the cannon bone and the fetlock joint. Inflammation can involve arthritis and can become a degenerative joint disease. The condition is a job risk for young thoroughbreds and is usually caused by stress and due to the trauma of repeated hard training in young horses. The first thing that appears on a horse with osselets is a swelling in the front part of the fetlock joint, there may be synovial strains on the sides of the joint. It is painful for the horse to flex the joint and usually causes lameness. Fetlock joint Definition Fetlock is the common name for the metacarpophalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints of horses, is a rotatory joint that can exhibit the greatest range of motion of any equine joint. Christopher E. Kawcak, Myra F. Barrett, in Joint Disease in the Horse (Second Edition), 2016 The fetlock joint is formed between the large metacarpal or metatarsal bone ( in the hindlimb and forelimb) and the proximal sesamoid bones.Dyce, Sack, and Wensing's Textbook of Veterinary Anatomy 5th Edition Relation with osselet Osselets is caused by stress on the fetlock, which results in a stretching of the joint capsule. If the inflammation damages the cartilage of the joint, swelling in that area can become chronic and permanent. The joint capsule can also thicken. Causes and effects Osselets is caused by stress on the fetlock, which results in a stretching of the joint capsule. The early stage is called green osselets, and is characterized by a hot, soft swelling at the fetlock. If inflammation damages the cartilage of the joint, the swelling may become chronic and permanent. Eventually, the bones of the joint will become involved, causing arthritis, pain, stiffness, and periostitis (new bone growth). The fibers of the joint capsule will also increase in size. The long pastern bone may also eventually chip at its front edge, which will leave bone fragments in the joint. Horses with short, upright pasterns are predisposed to develop osselets, as this conformation promotes concussion of the fetlock joint. Other contributors to the horse contracting the osselets include uneven tensions in the fetlock joint (usually due to poor or unbalanced footwear), irregular terrain and hasty conditioning. The latter often causes muscle fatigue and does not protect the horse's joints from tripping or \\"bad steps\\" while working. Diagnosis The horse will suffer pain in flexion, or when the animal presses on the affected front of the fetlock, it is indicative of osselets, as is the short and short march that is the result of when both frontal fetlocks are involved. (Shoulder problems can also cause a horse to move that way, so watch carefully.) The heat and swelling around the fetlock will be obvious when a horse has osselets. Treatment When it first appears, it can be cured with rest, which is very important for treatment. To relieve inflammation, it is advisable to apply cold compresses for several days. Anti-inflammatory medications administered orally or by injection may also be used. Another treatment would be to inject corticosteroids into the joint. However, if this kind of medication is used while the horse continues its continuous training or racing, they will inevitably lead to the destruction of joint surfaces.

Accessed April 11, 2014 It is a type of GDDR SDRAM (graphics DDR SDRAM).  Overview  Like its predecessor, GDDR4, GDDR5 is based on DDR3 SDRAM memory, which has double the data lines compared to DDR2 SDRAM. GDDR5 also uses 8-bit wide prefetch buffers similar to GDDR4 and DDR3 SDRAM. GDDR5 SGRAM conforms to the standards which were set out in the GDDR5 specification by the JEDEC. SGRAM is single-ported. However, it can open two memory pages at once, which simulates the dual-port nature of other VRAM technologies. It uses an 8N-prefetch architecture and DDR interface to achieve high performance operation and can be configured to operate in √ó32 mode or √ó16 (clamshell) mode which is detected during device initialization. The GDDR5 interface transfers two 32-bit wide data words per write clock (WCK) cycle to/from the I/O pins. Corresponding to the 8N-prefetch, a single write or read access consists of a 256-bit wide two CK clock cycle data transfer at the internal memory core and eight corresponding 32-bit wide one-half WCK clock cycle data transfers at the I/O pins. GDDR5 operates with two different clock types. A differential command clock (CK) as a reference for address and command inputs, and a forwarded differential write clock (WCK) as a reference for data reads and writes, that runs at twice the CK frequency. Being more precise, the GDDR5 SGRAM uses a total of three clocks: two write clocks associated with two bytes (WCK01 and WCK23) and a single command clock (CK). Taking a GDDR5 with 5 Gbit/s data rate per pin as an example, the CK runs with 1.25 GHz and both WCK clocks at 2.5 GHz. The CK and WCKs are phase aligned during the initialization and training sequence. This alignment allows read and write access with minimum latency. A single 32-bit GDDR5 chip has about 67 signal pins and the rest are power and grounds in the 170 BGA package. Commercialization of GDDR5 GDDR5 was revealed by Samsung Electronics in July 2007. They announced that they would mass-produce GDDR5 starting in January 2008. Hynix Semiconductor introduced the industry's first 60 nm class \\"1 Gb\\" (10243 bit) GDDR5 memory in 2007. It supported a bandwidth of 20 GB/s on a 32-bit bus, which enables memory configurations of 1 GB at 160 GB/s with only 8 circuits on a 256-bit bus. The following year, in 2008, Hynix bested this technology with its 50 nm class \\"1 Gb\\" GDDR5 memory. In November 2007, Qimonda, a spin-off of Infineon, demonstrated and sampled GDDR5,Register report . Retrieved November 2, 2007. and released a paper about the technologies behind GDDR5.Qimonda GDDR5 White Paper As of May 10, 2008, Qimonda announced volume production of 512 Mb GDDR5 components rated at 3.6 Gbit/s (900 MHz), 4.0 Gbit/s (1 GHz), and 4.5 Gbit/s (1.125 GHz).GDDR5 in Production, New Round of Graphics Cards War Imminent., retrieved May 11, 2008 On November 20, 2009, Elpida Memory announced the opening of the company's Munich Design Center, responsible for Graphics DRAM (GDDR) design and engineering. Elpida received GDDR design assets from Qimonda AG in August 2009 after Qimonda's bankruptcy. The design center has approximately 50 employees and is equipped with high-speed memory testing equipment for use in the design, development and evaluation of Graphics memory. On July 31, 2013, Elpida became a fully owned subsidiary of Micron Technology and based on current public LinkedIn professional profiles, Micron continues to operate the Graphics Design Center in Munich. Hynix 40 nm class \\"2 Gb\\" (2 √ó 10243 bit) GDDR5 was released in 2010. It operates at 7 GHz effective clock-speed and processes up to 28 GB/s.Hynix 1H '11 Product Catalog, page 8.

Accessed July 24, 2014. \\"2 Gb\\" GDDR5 memory chips will enable graphics cards with 2 GB or more of onboard memory with 224 GB/s or higher peak bandwidth. On June 25, 2008, AMD became the first company to ship products using GDDR5 memory with its Radeon HD 4870 video card series, incorporating Qimonda's 512 Mb memory modules at 3.6 Gbit/s bandwidth.Qimonda Press Release. May 21, 2008 AMD Press Release. June 25, 2008 In June 2010, Elpida Memory announced the company's 2 Gb GDDR5 memory solution, which was developed at the company's Munich Design Center. The new chip can work at up to 7 GHz effective clock-speed and will be used in graphics cards and other high bandwidth memory applications. \\"4 Gb\\" (4 √ó 10243 bit) GDDR5 components became available in the third quarter of 2013. Initially released by Hynix, Micron Technology quickly followed up with their implementation releasing in 2014. On February 20, 2013, it was announced that the PlayStation 4 will use sixteen 4 Gb GDDR5 memory chips for a total of 8 GB of GDDR5 @ 176 Gbit/s (CK 1.375 GHz and WCK 2.75 GHz) as combined system and graphics RAM for use with its AMD-powered system on a chip comprising 8 Jaguar cores, 1152 GCN shader processors and AMD TrueAudio. Product teardowns later confirmed the implementation of 4 Gb based GDDR5 memory in the PlayStation 4. In February 2014, as a result of its acquisition of Elpida, Micron Technology added 2 Gb and 4 Gb GDDR5 products into the company's portfolio of graphics memory solutions. As of January 15, 2015, Samsung announced in a press release that it had begun mass production of \\"8 Gb\\" (8 √ó 10243 bits) GDDR5 memory chips based on a 20 nm fabrication process. To meet the demand of higher resolution displays (such as 4K) becoming more mainstream, higher density chips are required in order to facilitate larger frame buffers for graphically intensive computation, namely PC gaming and other 3D rendering. Increased bandwidth of the new high-density modules equates to 8 Gbit/s per pin √ó 170 pins on the BGA package x 32-bits per I/O cycle, or 256 Gbit/s effective bandwidth per chip.  GDDR5X  On January 6, 2015, Micron Technology President Mark Adams announced the successful sampling of 8 Gb GDDR5 on the company's fiscal Q1-2015 earnings call. The company then announced, on January 25, 2015, that it had begun commercial shipments of GDDR5 using a 20 nm process technology. The formal announcement of Micron's 8 Gb GDDR5 appeared in the form of a blog post by Kristopher Kido on the company's website September 1, 2015. In January 2016, JEDEC standardized GDDR5X SGRAM. GDDR5X targets a transfer rate of 10 to 14 Gbit/s per pin, twice that of GDDR5. Essentially, it provides the memory controller the option to use either a double data rate mode that has a prefetch of 8n, or a quad data rate mode that has a prefetch of 16n. GDDR5 only has a double data rate mode that has an 8n prefetch. GDDR5X also uses 190 pins per chip (190 BGA). By comparison, standard GDDR5 has 170 pins per chip; (170 BGA). It therefore requires a modified PCB. GDDR5X commercialization Micron Technology began sampling GDDR5X chips in March 2016, and began mass production in May 2016. Nvidia officially announced the first graphics card using GDDR5X, the Pascal-based GeForce GTX 1080 on May 6, 2016. Later, the second graphics card to use GDDR5X, the Nvidia Titan X on July 21, 2016, the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti on February 28, 2017, and Nvidia Titan Xp on April 6, 2017.

From the earliest times, at least since the plays of Aristophanes, religion has been one of the three primary topics of literary satire, along with politics and sex.Clark (1991) pp.116-8 quotation: Clark, John R. and Motto, Anna Lydia (1973) Satire--that blasted art p.20Clark, John R. and Motto, Anna Lydia (1980) Menippeans & Their Satire: Concerning Monstrous Leamed Old Dogs and Hippocentaurs, in Scholia satyrica, Volume 6, 3/4, 1980 p.45 quotation: Satire which targets the clergy is a type of political satire, while religious satire is that which targets religious beliefs.Hodgart (2009) p.39 Religious satire is also sometimes called philosophical satire, and is thought to be the result of agnosticism or atheism. Notable works of religious satire surfaced during the Renaissance, with works by Geoffrey Chaucer, Erasmus and Albrecht D√ºrer. Religious satire has been criticised and at times censored in order to avoid offence, for example the film Life of Brian was initially banned in Ireland, Norway, some states of the US, and some towns and councils of the United Kingdom. This potential for censorship often leads to debates on the issue of freedom of speech such as in the case of the Religious Hatred Bill in January 2006. Critics of the original version of the Bill (such as comedian Rowan Atkinson) feared that satirists could be prosecuted.

Reactions, criticism and censorship Religious satire has been criticised by those who feel that sincerely held religious views should not be subject to ridicule. In some cases religious satire has been censored - for example, Moli√®re's play Tartuffe was banned in 1664. The film Life of Brian was initially banned in Ireland, Norway, some states of the US, and some towns and councils of the United Kingdom.Vicar supports Life of Brian ban In an interesting case of life mirroring art, activist groups who protested the film during its release bore striking similarities to some bands of religious zealots within the film itself.Dyke, C: Screening Scripture, pp. 238-240. Trinity Press International, 2002 Like much religious satire, the intent of the film has been misinterpreted and distorted by protesters. According to the Pythons, Life of Brian is not a critique of religion so much as an indictment of the hysteria and bureaucratic excess that often surrounds it. The issue of freedom of speech was hotly debated by the UK Parliament during the passing of the Religious Hatred Bill in January 2006. Critics of the original version of the Bill (such as comedian Rowan Atkinson) feared that satirists could be prosecuted, but an amendment by the House of Lords making it clear that this was not the case was passed - by just one vote. In 2006, Rachel Bevilacqua, a member of the Church of the SubGenius, known as Rev. Magdalen in the SubGenius hierarchy, lost custody and contact with her son after a district court judge took offense at her participation in the Church's X-Day festival.

Carr (November 28, 1924 ‚Äì April 9, 2008), who published as H. Y. Carr, was an American physicist and pioneer of magnetic resonance imaging. Carr was born in Alliance, Ohio where he was an Alliance High School graduate in January 1943; he later was inducted into their Hall of Fame. He served in the Army as a Sergeant in the 12th Weather Squadron Air Corps during World War II in Italy. After the War he received a Harvard National Scholarship from Harvard University and graduated summa cum laude in 1948 and also earned his master's degree in 1949 and a Ph.D. in physics in 1953 from Harvard University. His doctorate thesis, published in 1952, described the first techniques for using gradients in magnetic fields and is the first example of magnetic resonance imaging. He later moved to Rutgers University, where he was professor. Dr. Carr became Professor Emeritus in 1987 and was actively involved in the area of MRI with studies up until his death. In 2003 the Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to Paul C. Lauterbur and Peter Mansfield for their work on MRI. There was some controversy when Carr was not awarded the prize jointly with Lauterbur and Mansfield. See Nobel Prize controversies. Ten years before the Nobel announcement, Carr wrote to Physics Today noting that both his 1952 demonstration of use of magnetic gradients for spatial localization and his actual demonstration of 1-D \\"imaging\\" had been overlookedHerman Y. Carr, ‚ÄúLetter to Editor,‚Äù Physics Today, 1993 January, page 94. by the radiologist Felix Wehrli in a 1992 article.Felix W. Wehrli, ‚ÄúThe Origins and Future of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging,‚Äù Physics Today, 1992 June, page 34. In a later letter to Physics Today, Carr notedHerman Y. Carr, \\"Field Gradients in Early MRI,\\" Physics Today, 2004 July, page 83. that the 1952 MRI demonstration had also been overlooked by Bertram Schwarzschild in a 2003 article which referred to Wehrli‚Äôs 1992 article.Bertram Schwarzschild, ‚ÄúLauterbur and Mansfield Awarded Nobel Medicine Prize for MRI,‚Äù Physics Today, 2003 December, page 24. Schwarzschild did mention the 1952 use of field gradients to correlate nuclear signals to spatial location and thus enable the measurements of both diffusion and flow, but the 1952 MRI measurement of structure was not mentioned. As a professed pacifist he served on the National General Board of Church and Society of the United Methodist Church where he was a representative to Russia during glasnost promoting Christianity, justice and world peace. He was recognized and honored in 1995 with the Francis Asbury Award for fostering United Methodist Ministries in Higher Education. He was a very active member of the United Methodist Church of New Brunswick where he served many capacities as a church layman. His special interest was focused on the church's Urban Outreach to area public housing and men‚Äôs shelters, world peace and social justice. Professor Carr was known as a fine teacher and received a Guggenheim Fellowship where he participated in a cooperative research program at Cornell University, Oxford University in England and at the University of Amsterdam the Netherlands. In addition to numerous scientific publications Dr. Carr co-authored the introductory textbook Physics From the Ground Up published in 1971. In 2001 an anonymous donation created two Herman Y. Carr Scholarships in Physics and Astronomy at Rutgers University. Dr. Carr became Professor Emeritus in 1987 and was actively involved in the area of MRI studies up until his death. Herman Carr, 83, died peacefully on April 9, 2008 at his home in Bridgewater Township, New Jersey. He was the husband of Hilda Hagen Kinney, who had died on August 29, 1986.

It is available on all cable television providers in Ontario, as well as by webcast. When the legislature is not sitting, the network broadcasts committee hearings which take place in the Amethyst Room. Each Sunday, a compilation series called Sunday Encore rebroadcasts the highlights from the previous week. Closed captioning is also provided. The Ontario Parliament Network's coverage of Question Period is also aired from 3:00-4:00am the following morning on TVOntario stations. When meetings are adjourned and there are no sittings, the channel plays music in full-length albums and shows pictures in and around the building with scheduled sittings and events. This music includes jazz musicians like Oscar Peterson, Moe Koffman, Ed Bickert, Lorne Lofsky and Jim Galloway, and there are also classical, Latin, flamenco and British-style brass band albums. The classical performers include guitarists Liona Boyd and Norbert Kraft, cellist Ofra Harnoy, and trumpeter Johnny Cowell. Orchestras are the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, Toronto Chamber Orchestra, and CBC Vancouver Orchestra and the brass band is the Hannaford Street Silver Band. Around Christmas time, the selection changes to Christmas-themed albums by the same people and shows pictures inside the building all decorated with Christmas garments and tree.  List of transmitters  In a number of small communities in Northern Ontario without cable service, TVOntario also formerly operated LPTV transmitters which broadcast the network as a conventional over- the-air signal. These transmitters operated with the call sign CJOL-TV. As well as the service's regular programming, the transmitters also leased broadcasting time to the Wawatay Native Communications Society, a producer of First Nations television programming.\\"Northern graduates band together Taught by radio in remote areas, natives to get diplomas\\".

He has currently made twelve appearances for his country, making his debut back in 1998. Management McGeeney managed the Kildare senior football team from 2007 until 2013. On 15 July 2012, Sean Johnston made his debut for Kildare in an All-Ireland Senior Football Championship qualifier against his native Cavan, coming on as a substitute late in the second half and scoring Kildare's final point of the match. The substitution was regarded by many as a genius managerial move by McGeeney whose team were only winning by 16 points at the time. Some commentators recognise this move as the starting point for McGeeney's illustrious and successful managerial career which so far includes one under 21 Leinster title. He was axed after losing a ballot by county delegates by one vote, 29 to 28 in September 2013. In October 2013, McGeeney joined the management team of the Armagh football team under Paul Grimley .

The band began playing small bars and frat parties on campus with members Himebaugh, Matt McDevitt (keyboards), Frank Gerage (guitar/bass) and Pat Wagner (drums). The group soon branched out to other campuses in Illinois along with a few shows in Chicago at the now legendary Otis'. The members of Hello Dave changed over the years- Himebaugh the mainstay played and traveled hundreds of thousands of miles with Eli Becker (bass), Chris Clemente (bass), Mike Hall (guitar), Willis Potocki(bass), Blake Cox (bass), Steve Merchant (drums), Bryan Resendiz (drums), Tony Orant (keyboards and vocals)Allen Wetzel (bass), and current members- Mike Magoo McGohan (guitar), Marty Williamson (guitar), Peter Bauschke (drums) and Matt Longbons (bass). The band criss crossed the country many times and played shows with bands including- Big Head Todd and the Monsters, Blues Traveler, Train, Keith Urban, Tim McGraw, OAR, Pat Green, Robert Earl Keen, The Doobie Brothers, REO Speedwagon, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Sister Hazel, Big and Rich, Lady Antebellum and the list goes on.

Recently HD traveled to Nashville to work with producer Wyatt Easterling and engineer Mark Capps (three time grammy winner). Throughout the decade of 2000 the band traveled the world doing shows for the US Military- from Japan to Alaska, Iraq to Korea, Saudi Arabia to Hawaii and Europe. Nearly once every year they toured for a week to 6 weeks for the men and women of America's Armed Forces.  \\"Chicago Twang\\"  Himebaugh describes the band's sound as Chicago Twang (a phrase that's been a part of the Chicago music scene since the 1920s) - \\"not quite country and not quite rock and roll\\"- and wrote a song by the same name describing the exploits of the band on its journey as a mainstay on the music scene.

The keshi it includes are monochromatic and derived from the Kinnikuman („Ç≠„É≥ËÇâ„Éû„É≥) anime and manga franchise, whose primary motif is professional wrestling. The line was launched in Japan in 1983, and licensed in 1985 for the American market as M.U.S.C.L.E. (reflecting Kinnikuman's English title of Muscleman). M.U.S.C.L.E. used a harder rubber than Kinkeshi; its U.S. sequel, Ultimate Muscle, had a small release of about twenty Kinkeshi, though a larger run of figures using a plastic softer than M.U.S.C.L.E. but not eraser-like was released exclusively in the USA. History Starting in Japan in 1983, Bandai's Kinkeshi line was licensed in 1985 to Mattel for marketing in the United States and Canada, where wrestling had become popular. This North American line was renamed \\"M.U.S.C.L.E.\\" (Millions of Unusual Small Creatures Lurking Everywhere). The line included 236 official figures, a boardgame, a NES game entitled M.U.S.C.L.E., a championship belt figure holder, and a wrestling ring playset. The figures were distributed in clear, blister-packed random four-packs, semi-opaque garbage can 10-packs, and 28 packs featuring non-random assortments. For a short time, the figures were also distributed as a bonus in Nestl√© Quik (now known as Nesquik) cans.http://blog.uofmuscle.com/course-catalog/advertising- promotion/advertising-promotion-200-the-muscle-nestle-quik-tin/ The main hero was Kinnikuman, who, in the US, was \\"Muscle Man\\" and was the leader of the \\"Thug Busters\\". The only other named figure in the US line was Buffaloman, who was renamed \\"Terri-Bull,\\" and was said to be the leader of the \\"Cosmic Crunchers\\". Some of the figures were sculpted to resemble popular wrestlers who had competed in Japan such as Terry Funk, Dusty Rhodes, Abdullah The Butcher, and Jushin \\"Thunder\\" Liger. The first shipment of figures were all a \\"bubble-gum\\" pink color that the collecting community calls \\"flesh\\". The second shipment was a half-and-half mixture of flesh and either dark blue, red, or purple figures. The third shipment contained no flesh figures, only dark blue, red, purple, magenta, salmon, lime green, neon orange, and light blue. Five figures came with the boardgame in an exclusive grape or light purple color. In addition to packs containing only figures, there was a mail- away poster, a \\"Battlin' Belt\\" display case, and two games released that made use of the M.U.S.C.L.E. figures. The \\"Hard Knockin' Rockin' Ring\\" game was a plastic wrestling ring with two small clamps for figures and that played much like Rock'em Sock'em Robots. The M.U.S.C.L.E. board game was a unique battle- royal style game where teams of five figures of two different colors fought. The Hard Knockin' Rockin' Ring came with two exclusive flesh figures not released in the regular line of toys, a slightly smaller version of #141 (Muscleman) and a Terri-Bull. The board game also included the same sculpt of Terri-Bull in lime green. Circa 1987, unlicensed Kinkeshi were marketed in Western-Europe. The Sesto Fiorentino based GIG Spa company mixed three different imported keshi lines to create its own franchise. Around the same period, the Exogini line was marketed in France as Cosmix by El Greco \\"Un hellenistic crafts S.A.\\", a Greek manufacturer, to Action GT (Action Games & Toys Inc.), a North American company, and imported to France by Id√©al Loisirs S.A., a famous French toy distributor. The models and even the leaflet catalogues were identical, however the package and character names were totally different. The gum colors and types were also distinct to each line with the exception of the generic \\"salmon matte\\" type. The Exogini had more gum variations than the Cosmix line and the third keshi series did not appeared in the French line. The very same product, including later series figure though, was sold under various names in South Korea circa 1991. However, France was the only country, outside of the franchise's native Japan, to broadcast the Kinnikuman TV series (localized as Muscleman) by that time. Later, a dubbed Kinnikuman version was broadcast in Catalonia (Spain) as Musculman in the '90s. Its sequel, Kinnikuman Nisei, appeared in the United States (Ultimate Muscle: The Kinnikuman Legacy) in the early 2000s. In South Korea, where the manga was early published by King Comics, Kinnukuman is known as \\"Í∑ºÏú°Îß®\\". Few years later, a third Kinkeshi line appeared in the United States as Alien Wrestler. It was available in Italy, where these Kinkeshi were freely included in a crisps brand's special offer. This Taiwan-made bootleg line was an inferior gum quality compared to the first bootleg generation and featured the late \\"PART\\" series of the Kinkeshi line. In the United States, the sequel to Kinnikuman, Kinnikuman NiSei was translated by 4Kids Entertainment in 2002 and aired from 2002-2004 on Saturday mornings. It was re-aired in 2006 as summer filler. In 2003, Bandai America launched a new Kinkeshi series extension exclusively for the North American market. Ultimate Muscle: The Kinnikuman Legacy, the American dubbed version of Kinnikuman Second Generations, is actually more successful overseas than in Japan. It enjoys a dedicated following in the 14-30 year age group. Figures, both 6.5\\" articulated and 1.5\\" M.U.S.C.L.E.-sized, based on the Ultimate Muscle storyline were released sporadically in 2003, as well as a collectible card game entitled Ultimate Muscle Battle Card Game. In 2004, a knockoff of Alien Wrestler entitled Future Man was marketed in both mono-pink and multicolored varieties. The details of the figures were not as sharp as the official releases.

Taricco, whose father was Italian and hailed from Sardinia, was as a full-back capable of playing as right or left back who initially played from 1993 to 2004. He began his career in his native Argentina for Argentinos Juniors before transferring to England where he spent the next 10 years representing Ipswich Town, Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United. He suffered a hamstring injury on his debut for West Ham and agreed to cancel his contract after the game, retiring from professional football. He later playing for lower league Italian side A.S. Villasimius and Castiadas before later joining Brighton & Hove Albion as an assistant manager to Gus Poyet in 2009. He also resumed his professional football career in the 2010‚Äì11 season before retiring for the second time at the end of the 2012‚Äì13 season and would go on to follow Poyet to Sunderland, AEK Athens, Real Betis, Shanghai Shenhua and Bordeaux during the following seasons. Playing career=Argentinos Juniors Taricco began his football career at Buenos Aires club Argentinos Juniors, coming through the club's famous youth team to make his first team debut in 1993. After only one season in the first team, he moved to English side Ipswich Town.http://www.bdfa.com.ar/jugadores-MAURICIO-RICARDO- TARICCO-2656.html Ipswich Town In September 1994, Taricco joined Ipswich Town for around ¬£150,000 after then Ipswich Town manager John Lyall looked for new players in South America. He was signed alongside Uruguayan Adri√°n Paz, who played at Estudiantes de La Plata. Both were represented by FIFA agent, Marcelo Houseman, brother of 1978 FIFA World Cup champion Ren√© Houseman. Taricco made his debut in a League Cup match which ended as a 3‚Äì0 home loss against Bolton Wanderers, playing the whole match in his sole appearance of the season, which saw Ipswich Town relegated from Premier League. On 26 August 1995, Taricco played his first league match under manager George Burley, who replace Lyall midway in the previous season. The match against West Bromwich Albion ended 0‚Äì0. He quickly made an impression as a solid defender blessed with immaculate passing ability and considerable attacking flair, and he went on to make 47 appearances that season.http://www.sporting- heroes.net/football/ipswich-town-fc/mauricio-taricco-8839/brief-biography-of- his-career-at-portman-road_a12309/ Early in the 1996‚Äì97 season, Taricco scored his first goal for Ipswich Town in a 5‚Äì2 win over Reading. and his second on 8 March 1997 in a 1‚Äì0 away win over Stoke City. His talent earned him the 1997 Ipswich Town F.C. Player of the Year, receiving the award in 18 April, just before a match against rivals Norwich City. Taricco confirmed his popularity by scoring in that match, which ended in a 2‚Äì0 win for Ipswich Town. His club finished in 4th place in the 1996‚Äì97 First Division, only to be beaten by Sheffield United on away goals in the 1997 First Division play-offs semifinal. He further endeared himself to his fans by leaving the Portman Road pitch in tears after the elimination, playing a total of 53 matches during the season. In the 1997‚Äì98 season, Taricco made another 53 appearances for Ipswich Town, reaching the quarter-finals in the 1997‚Äì98 Football League Cup before losing to Chelsea in a penalty shoot-out after a 2‚Äì2 draw in regular time, in which Taricco scored. He also scored in the 2‚Äì0 win against Manchester United in the previous round. Ipswich Town again reached the First Division play-offs after finishing 5th, but lost twice to Charlton Athletic in the semifinals. That season, Taricco was named in the PFA Team of the Year. Taricco continued his good form at the start of 1998‚Äì99, which included a spectacular goal following a run from inside his own half against Crystal Palace on 3 October 1998. He caught the attention of Tottenham Hotspur, whose bid of ¬£1.775m Ipswich found impossible to refuse. His final game for the club turned out to be a 2‚Äì0 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 3 November 1998, when he was stretchered off in the last few minutes. He played a total of 137 league matches, scoring 4 goals. Tottenham Hotspur Taricco was about to be signed by Tottenham Hotspur on 5 November 1998, but a knock to his ankle in his last match delayed the transfer in some weeks, in a deal worth ¬£1.75 million, becoming George Graham's first signing at the club. His Premier League debut came on 16 January 1999 against Wimbledon in a goalless draw, with his full debut being again a 0‚Äì0 draw on 20 February 1999 against Middlesbrough. Taricco ended his first season with 13 league appearances. He did not take part in the 1998‚Äì99 Football League Cup triumph since he was cup-tied. Taricco earned a regular starting role as left-back with Justin Edinburgh nearing the end of his Spurs career and Paolo Tramezzani failing to impress. He played a total of 29 league matches in the 1999‚Äì2000 season. In the summer of 2000, after Ben Thatcher was signed as left-back option, Ipswich Town tried to sign Taricco back, but the deal was rejected. The Argentinian played only five times in the 2000‚Äì01 season, being sidelined for most of the season due to injuries. He returned as a starter in the following season as a right-back, filling in for the injured Stephen Carr and playing 30 Premier League matches in the season, even though he missed five matches for consecutive sending offs against Manchester United and Chelsea in March 2002. Taricco also played in the 2002 Football League Cup Final where his side lost to Blackburn Rovers.http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/worthington_cup/1834988.stm Taricco faced greater competition during the 2002‚Äì03 season as Carr recovered from his injury, returning to the left-back position. He played only 21 Premier League matches and scored his first goal for the Spurs in a 3‚Äì2 loss against Liverpool. Following Thatcher's departure to Leicester City, Taricco played 32 league matches during the 2003‚Äì04 season, scoring once against Leeds United early on 23 August 2003. His temperament came into question following spats with Chelsea's Scott Parker and Damien Duff in April 2004, and Taricco was banned for the first three matches of the 2004‚Äì05 season. In the summer of 2004, Taricco was overlooked by new manager Jacques Santini, who favoured the recently signed Erik Edman at left-back. He also failed to impress Martin Jol, who was appointed in November 2004 and was released in the same month. West Ham United On 19 November 2004, shortly after being a free agent, Taricco signed for West Ham United. He made his debut for the League Championship club as a starter in the Dockers derby against Millwall only two days after signing, but tore his hamstring and was replaced in the first half. Although the injury would have had him sidelined for eight weeks, he offered to have his contract with the club cancelled, which the club accepted, claiming he would not be able to contribute if he was having treatment for over two months. At the time, Alan Pardew, his manager, commented that it was one of the most honest things he had ever known a footballer to do.https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/honest- taricco-leaves-west-ham-22034.html Shortly after, he confirmed his retirement from professional football. Italian amateur football Taricco, who had stated his desire to play in Italian football during his Tottenham Hotspur tenure, joined amateur Sardinian club AS Villasimius in 2005, who then competed in Eccellenza Sardinia, in the fifth tier of Italian football. He stayed at the club for four years before joining Castiadas, who also played at Eccellenza Sardinia, on 6 August 2009. In November 2009, he left Castiadas in order to become assistant manager to Gus Poyet, his former teammate at Tottenham Hotspur, at English team Brighton & Hove Albion. Brighton & Hove Albion Despite joining Brighton & Hove Albion as assistant manager, Taricco returned to professional football after almost six years from his last professional appearance starting at left-back for an FA Cup clash against Woking on 16 November 2010, with Brighton & Hove Albion winning the game on penalties. He was sent off for a second bookable offence after 105 minutes. Taricco also played four league matches as Brighton & Hove Albion won the 2010‚Äì11 Football League One title. After playing less than an hour in a 3‚Äì1 defeat against Crystal Palace on 27 September 2011 and not featuring in the playing squad against his former club Ipswich Town, Taricco announced his retirement from professional football on 3 October 2011, only to come back out of retirement weeks after when he played against Birmingham City on 29 October. He was sent off again, this time receiving a straight red card, during the 3‚Äì0 away defeat to Championship League leaders Southampton on 19 November. Taricco played his last match in a 3‚Äì0 win against Southampton on 2 January 2012. Assistant manager career=Brighton & Hove Albion On 10 November 2009, it was announced that Taricco would be assistant manager to Gus Poyet at English team Brighton & Hove Albion. During his spell, he also played 15 league matches after being away from professional football for six years. When manager Poyet left the club in June 2013, Taricco also left his position. Sunderland On 8 October 2013, Taricco joined Sunderland, again as assistant manager to Poyet. When Poyet was sacked on 16 March 2015 after a poor run of results, Taricco also left the club. AEK Athens Taricco followed Poyet at AEK Athens when the Uruguayan has been named manager of the Greek club on 30 October 2015. Real Betis After Poyet was hired by Real Betis on 9 May 2016, Taricco joined the Spanish club as assistant manager. Shanghai Greenland Shenhua On 29 November 2016, Taricco joined Shanghai Greenland Shenhua, still again as assistant coach to Poyet. Girondins de Bordeaux On 20 January 2018, after Poyet was named manager at Bordeaux, he joined the club as an assistant coach alongside Fernando Menegazzo.

He graduated from Northwestern College in Watertown, Wisconsin in 1872 and from Concordia Seminary in St. Louis in 1875. He was a Lutheran pastor from 1875 to 1878, serving first at Centerville, Wisconsin and then at Manitowoc, Wisconsin. He became a professor of theology at Concordia Seminary in 1878, and in 1887 he became president of the same institution.

As a systematic theologian, Franz Pieper's magnum opus, Christliche Dogmatik (1917-1924), provided the modern world with a learned and extensive presentation of orthodox Lutheran theology.Francis Pieper, Christian Dogmatics, 4 vols., (St Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1950-1953), 1:v.

Atlantic history is split between three different contexts: trans-Atlantic history, meaning the international history of the Atlantic World; circum-Atlantic history, meaning the transnational history of the Atlantic World; and cis-Atlantic history within an Atlantic context. The Atlantic slave trade continued into the 19th century, but the international trade was largely outlawed in 1807 by Britain. Slavery ended in 1865 in the United States and in the 1880s in Brazil (1888) and Cuba (1886).David Eltis, et al. Atlas of the Transatlantic Slave Trade (2010) While some scholars stress that the history of the \\"Atlantic World\\" culminates in the \\"Atlantic Revolutions\\" of the late 18th early 19th centuries,Wim Klooster, Revolutions in the Atlantic World: A Comparative History (2009) the most influential research in the field examines the slave trade and the study of slavery, thus in the late-19th century terminus as part of the transition from Atlantic history to globalization seems most appropriate. The historiography of the Atlantic World, known as Atlantic history, has grown enormously since the 1990s.Alison Games and Adam Rothman, eds., Major Problems in Atlantic History: Documents and Essays (2007) Concept=Geography The Atlantic World comprises the histories of Europe, Africa, and the Americas. Travel over land was difficult and expensive, so settlements were made along the coast, especially where rivers allowed small boats to travel inland. Distant settlements were linked by elaborate sea-based trading networks. Since the easiest and cheapest way of long-distance travel was by sea, international trading networks emerged in the Atlantic World, with major hubs at London, Amsterdam, Boston, and Havana. Time was a factor, as sailing ships averaged about 2 knots speed (50 miles a day). Navigators had to rely on maps of currents or they would be becalmed for days or weeks.Peggy K. Liss, Atlantic Empires: The Network of Trade and Revolution, 1713-1826 (Johns Hopkins Studies in Atlantic History and Culture) (1982) These maps were not only for navigational purposes however, but also as a way to give insight in regards to power and ownership of lands that had already been claimed, essentially creating a greater desire to finding new routes and land. One major goal for centuries was finding the Northwest Passage (through what is now Canada) from Europe to Asia.Pierre Berton, The Arctic Grail: The Quest for the Northwest Passage and the North Pole, 1818-1909 (2000) Emergence Garcia II, monarch of Kongo in West Central Africa in 1642 Given the scope of Atlantic history it has tended to downplay the singular influence of the voyages of Columbus and to focus more on growing interactions among African and European polities (ca 1450-1500), including contact and conflict in the Mediterranean and Atlantic islands, as critical to the emergence of the Atlantic World. Awareness of the Atlantic World, of course, spiked post-1492: after the earliest European voyages to the New World and continuing encounters on the African coast, a Euro-centric division of the Atlantic was proclaimed between the Spanish Empire and the Portuguese Empire by the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494. The West Coast and Central Africa, which are distinct from one another and each made up of many competing polities, played core roles in shaping the Atlantic World and as major sources for slave labor.John Kelly Thornton, Africa and Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World, 1400-1680 (2nd ed. 1998) An elaborate network of economic, geopolitical and cultural exchange took shape‚Äîan \\"Atlantic World\\" comparable to the \\"Mediterranean World\\".

Historical usage Historian Bernard Bailyn traces the concept of the Atlantic World to an editorial published by journalist Walter Lippmann in 1917.Bailyn, Atlantic History, 6-7. The alliance of the United States and Great Britain in World War II, and the subsequent creation of NATO, heightened historians' interest in the history of interaction between societies on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.Bailyn, Atlantic History, 9. Other scholars emphasize its intellectual origins in the more systematic and less poliltical approach of the French Annales school, especially the influential work by Fernand Braudel on the Mediterranean World (trans. 2 vols, 1973).Alison Games, \\"Atlantic History: Definitions, Challenges, and Opportunities\\". American Historical Review. 111 (June 2006), 741-757 In American and British universities, Atlantic World history is supplementing (and possibly supplanting) the study of specific European colonial societies in the Americas, e.g. British North America or Spanish America. Some critics see this North Atlantic emphasis as a return to British Imperial history that underplays the importance of African history, the slave trade, and their influential roles in Brazil and the multi-national Caribbean. Atlantic World history differs from traditional approaches to the history of colonization in its emphasis on inter-regional and international comparisons and its attention to events and trends that transcended national borders. Atlantic World history emphasizes how the colonization of the Americas reshaped Africa and Europe, provided a foundation for later globalization, and insists that our understanding of the past benefits from looking beyond the nation state as our primary (or sole) category of analysis. Aspects=Environment The beginning of extensive contact between Europe, Africa, and the Americas had sweeping implications for the environmental and demographic history of all the regions involved. In the process known as the Columbian Exchange, numerous plants, animals, and diseases were transplanted‚Äîboth deliberately and inadvertently‚Äîfrom one continent to another. The epidemiological impact of this exchange on the indigenous peoples of the Americas was profound, causing very high death rates and population declines of 50% to 90% or even 100%. European and African immigrants also had very high death rates on their arrival, but they could be and were replaced by new shipments of immigrants (see the Population history of American indigenous peoples). Many foods that are common in present-day Europe, including corn (maize) and potatoes, originated in the New World and were unknown in Europe before the 16th century. Similarly, some staple crops of present-day West Africa, including cassava and peanuts, originated in the New World. Some of the staple crops of Latin America, such as coffee and sugarcane, were introduced by European settlers in the course of the Columbian Exchange.Timothy Silver, A New Face on the Countryside: Indians, Colonists, and Slaves in South Atlantic Forests, 1500-1800 (Studies in Environment and History) (1990) Slavery and labor plantation in Virginia, depicted in 1670 The slave trade played a role in the history of the Atlantic World almost from the beginning.Hugh Thomas, The slave trade: The History of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1440-1870 (2006) excerpt and text search As European powers began to conquer and claim large territories in the Americas in the 16th and 17th centuries, the role of chattel slavery and other forced labor systems in the development of the Atlantic World expanded. European powers typically had vast territories that they wished to exploit through agriculture, mining, or other extractive industries, but they lacked the work force that they needed to exploit their lands effectively. Consequently, they turned to a variety of coercive labor systems to meet their needs. At first the goal was to use native workers. Native Americans were employed through Indian slavery and through the Spanish system of encomienda. Indian labor was not effective on a large scale for complex reasons (e.g., high death rates and relative ease of escape to Native communities), so plantation owners turned to African slaves via the Atlantic slave trade. European workers arrived as indentured servants or transported felons who went free after a term of labor. In short, the Atlantic World was one of widespread inequality where the exploitation of human labor provided the foundation for a small handful of elites to reap enormous profits. The Trans-Atlantic Slave trade played a massive role in shaping the demographics of the Americas, especially in areas where huge plantations were the norm, such as in Brazil and the Caribbean. Roughly three quarters of immigrants to the Americas before 1820 were African, and more than half of these Africans were originally from West or Central Africa. In Brazil, the population percentage of Africans was even higher, with about seven African to every one Portuguese immigrant.Sweet, James. \\"The Evolution of Ritual in the African Diaspora\\". (n.d.): 64-80. Web. Because there was such a large population of Africans, it is unsurprising that African slaves aided in shaping the culture of these regions. In the early colonial period, there was a high prevalence of African spiritual practices, such as spirit possessions and healing practices. Presumably, these practices served as a point of connection and as an identity hold for slaves hailing from the same African origin.Sweet, James H. \\"Mutual Misunderstandings: Gester, Gender, and Healing in the African Portuguese World\\". Past and Present 4th ser. (2009): 128-43. Web. Such cultural practices allowed, at least to an extent, African slaves to maintain kinship structures similar to those that they might have seen in their homeland. In many cases, European authorities viewed spiritual positions that were highly esteemed in African societies to be socially unacceptable, morally corrupt, and heretical. This led to the disappearance or transformation of most African religious practices. For example, the practice of consulting kilundu, or Angolan spirits, was seen as homosexual by Portuguese authorities, a clear example of Eurocentrism in colonial societies, as European ideas of religion often did not match African ones. Unfortunately, there is a lack of documents written from the African point of view, so almost all information from this time period in these colonial societies is subject to cross-cultural misinterpretation, omission of facts, or other such changes that could affect the quality of description of African spiritual practices. Maintaining the integrity of cultural practices was difficult due to disagreement with European propriety and European tendency to generalize the African demographic makeup to merely \\"Central African\\", rather than acknowledging individual cultures. Eventually, most African traditions such as Kilundu, which was ultimately reduced to the popular Brazilian dance \\"Lundu\\", were either absorbed into other African traditions or reduced to a ritual simply resembling the original tradition. The extent of voluntary immigration to the Atlantic World varied considerably by region, nationality, and time period. Many European nations, particularly the Netherlands and France, only managed to send a few thousand voluntary immigrants. Though 15,000 or so who came to New France multiplied rapidly. In New Netherland, the Dutch coped by recruiting immigrants of other nationalities.Jaap Jacobs, New Netherland: A Dutch Colony in Seventeenth-Century America (The Atlantic World) (2004) In New England, the massive Puritan migration of the first half of the 17th century created a large free workforce and thus obviated the need to use unfree labor on a large scale. Colonial New England's reliance on the labor of free men, women, and children, organized in individual farm households, is called the yeoman or household labor system.Francis J. Bremer, First Founders: American Puritans and Puritanism in an Atlantic World (2012) There is an important distinction to be made between \\"societies with slaves\\", such as colonial New England, and \\"slave societies\\", where slavery was so central that it can properly be said to define all aspects of life in that region.Ira Berlin, \\"Generations of Captivity: A History of African American Slaves\\" (2003) The French colony of Saint-Domingue was one of the first American jurisdictions to end slavery, in 1794. Brazil was last nation in the Western Hemisphere to end slavery, in 1888. Governance The Spanish conquistadores conquered the Aztec Empire, more accurately now referred to by scholars as the Mexica empire, in present-day Mexico, and the Inca Empire, in present-day Peru, with surprising speed, assisted by horses, guns, large numbers of Native allies, and, perhaps above all, by the devastating mortality inflicted by newly introduced diseases such as smallpox. To some extent the prior emergence of the large and wealthy Inca and Mexica civilizations aided the transfer of governance to the Spanish, since these native empires had already established road systems, state bureaucracies and systems of taxation and intensive agriculture that were often inherited wholesale and then modified by the Spanish. The early Spanish conquerors of these empires were also aided by political instability and internal conflict within the Mexica and Incan regimes, which they successfully exploited to their benefit.John Huxtable Elliott, Empires of the Atlantic World: Britain and Spain in America 1492-1830 (2007) One of the problems that most European governments faced in the Americas was how to exercise authority over vast expanses of territory.Jacob Cooke, ed., Encyclopedia of the North American Colonies (1993) vol 1 Spain, which colonized Mexico, Central America, and the greater part of South America, established a network of powerful viceroyalties to administer different regions of its New World holdings: the Viceroyalty of New Spain (1535), the Viceroyalty of Peru (1542), the Viceroyalty of New Granada (1717/1739), and the Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata (1776). The result was strong government that became even stronger during the Bourbon reforms of the 18th century.Elliott, Empires of the Atlantic World: Britain and Spain in America 1492-1830 (2007) Britain approached the task of governing its New World territories in a less centralized manner, establishing about twenty distinct colonies in North America and the Caribbean from 1585 onward. Each British colony had its own governor and most would have representative assemblies. Most of the North American Thirteen Colonies that became the United States had strong self-government via popular assemblies that countered the authority of governors with their own assertions of rights via parliamentary and other English sources of authority. Only property owners could vote in British polities, but since so many free men in mainland British Colonial America owned land, a majority could vote and participate in popular politics. The British challenge to the authority of colonial assemblies, especially via taxation, was a major cause of the American Revolution in the 1770s.Jack P. Greene and J. R. Pole, eds.. A Companion to the American Revolution (Blackwell, 2003) excerpt and text search \\"Atlantic Revolutions\\" The Marquis de Lafayette, pictured in 1790, played a prominent role in both the American Revolution (1775‚Äì83) and French Revolution (1789‚Äì99) A wave of revolutions shook the Atlantic World from the 1770s to the 1820s, including in the United States (1775‚Äì1783), France and French- controlled Europe (1789‚Äì1814), Haiti (1791‚Äì1804), and Spanish America (1806‚Äì1830).Wim Klooster, Revolutions in the Atlantic World: A Comparative History (2009) There were smaller upheavals in Switzerland, Russia, and Brazil. The revolutionaries in varied places were aware of recent anti- colonial struggles in other Atlantic societies and even interacted with one another in many cases.Laurent Dubois and Richard Rabinowitz, eds. Revolution!: The Atlantic World Reborn (2011) Independence movements in the New World began with the American Revolution, 1775-1783, in which France, the Netherlands and Spain assisted the new United States of America as it secured independence from Britain. In August 1791 a coordinated slave uprising in the wealthy French sugar colony of St. Domingue began the Haitian Revolution. A long and destructive period of international warfare there came to a close with the creation of Haiti as an independent black republic in 1804. It has a complex and contested legacy as the largest successful slave revolt in history and was accompanied by widespread violence. With Spain tied down in European wars, the mainland Spanish colonies waged independence movements over a long period from 1806 to 1830, sometimes inspired by, but often fearful of, the Haitian example, which delayed effective independence movements in the slave societies of the Caribbean and Brazil until the late-19th century and later. In long- term perspective, the revolutions were mostly successful. They spread widely the ideals of republicanism, the overthrow of aristocracies, kings and established churches. They emphasized the universal ideals of The Enlightenment, such as the equality of all men. They emphasized equal justice under law by disinterested courts, as opposed to particular justice handed down at the whim of a local noble. They showed that the modern notion of revolution, of starting fresh with a radically new government, could actually work in practice. Revolutionary mentalities were born and continue to flourish to the present day.Robert R. Palmer, The Age of the Democratic Revolution: A Political History of Europe and America, 1760‚Äì1800. (2 vol, 1959‚Äì1964) When assessed in comparative perspective, the American Revolution (and especially the Federal Constitution that protected slavery as a legal institution) seems less radical and with a more oligarchic outcome than when viewed through a traditional nationalistic lens.

The disaster was caused by a methane gas explosion killing 54 miners. The explosion occurred shortly after the day shift started, sometime between 7:30 and 8:00 Christmas Eve morning.Mining Memories: 54 men killed in the Moweaqua Coal Mine Disaster are remembered on 70th anniversary, Decatur Herald and Review, December 24, 2002 Less than three years later (1935), the dangerous mine closed permanently. The Moweaqua Coal Mine Museum, founded in 1986, contains many mining artifacts that recall the disaster and the work of the miners.  History of Moweaqua Coal Mining Industry  A large coal seam was first found in Moweaqua on October 3, 1889, after two months of drilling by the Samuel Warner and Son firm as reported in the Moweaqua Call-Mail, the local newspaper. Two years later in November the first mining shaft site was commissioned a few blocks from the railroad depot, but under a new drilling company called the Cochran Coal and Mining Company under James G. Cochran. Ground was broken for mine construction on December 21, 1891, on land bought from Mrs. M.K. Duncan and the Moweaqua Coal and Manufacturing Company was officially formed. The Moweaqua Call-Mail urged people living in the town to hold out for the coal they hoped to find because then they could buy the coal locally and it would be much cheaper for farmers and manufacturers. On August 30, 1892, three six-foot veins of coal were found in the mine below the Earth‚Äôs surface and were sold in the market a few days later. The success of the mine increased over the coming months and by February 9, 1893, 25 tons () of coal was being raised per day and sold at $1.25 for nut coal and $1.50 for lump coal. The mine also introduced plans to have steel fiber cables installed so they could lift eleven tons () of coal at once. On August 8, 1894, the first mule was taken into the mine which allowed the mine to hire more workers to watch over the animals in the mine. By 1897, over 100 miners were working in the mine as cage men, motor men, mule drivers, shot firers, blacksmiths and miners. With the increasing number of workers in the mine, Catholic families began to express interest to build a church in Moweaqua and four lots were purchased from a man named Mr. Prescott to start a church. Many single men as well as families were drawn to Moweaqua over the years leading up to the 1932 Disaster because of the prosperous mine and the growing sense of community in the town, but the migrant workers ended up being disconnected from the community, and everyone kept to themselves.  The Disaster  On December 24, 1932, at 8:15 AM, the whistle from the mine blew. People from the town began to gather outside the mine because they knew that the whistle meant that something went wrong at the work site. There was a methane gas explosion in the mine shaft a few minutes before they got there. It was later discovered in a state investigation published February 1, 1933, by the Moweaqua News that the disaster was caused by the open flame of a miner‚Äôs carbide lamp which ignited the methane gas and prompted the explosion. Only about half of the miners were working that day as it was Christmas Eve and many chose to stay home with their families or were out of the town. 54 miners were trapped below the ground in the shaft. Two miners named Frank Floski and Ibra Adams did survive the accident because they were in a cage deeper in the mine. Specially trained rescue miners from Pana and Springfield arrived to help control the situation and retrieve bodies from the mine. When the other miners who had taken the day off arrived at the mine, they were not allowed in. The Illinois Central Railroad brought in cars to give the rescue miners a place to sleep and food to eat. The American Red Cross, the Moweaqua Hospital and people in the town also helped provide meals for the workers. The rescue miners worked for six days to find all of the bodies in the mine.  Victims and After Effects  The owner of the mine, Mr. Shafer, said, \\"If the mine is reopened, every safety precaution would be taken of course. Upon the recommendation of the state mine inspector, nothing but electric safety lamps would be used in the future.\\" The mine then reopened on December 28, 1933, after a service was held four days earlier to remember and honor the men who died in the disaster exactly one year before and to commemorate the rescue mine workers who helped uncover the bodies of the men trapped in the mine. The mine started up with success and by March 7, 1934, 65 men were back working in the mine again. In that year, a new company owned by Glen Shafer from Pana, Springfield called the Erie Sootless Coal Company of Moweaqua opened the mine after the summer. No coal was brought up after March 1935 and the shafts were officially closed in 1936, but were never sold. The tipple was mostly torn down by June 1940 and the remaining pieces of the structure blew over due to harsh winds and ruined the engine room five months later. The mine was finally destroyed in October 1941 due to rotting wood in the timbers holding up the mine walls and ceiling and the shaft collapsed on itself creating a sink hole eighty feet wide.  Museum and Memory  A museum was set up in Moweaqua to honor and remember the men who both lost their lives in the 1932 Coal Mine Disaster as well as any other men who served in the mines. It was also created to educate the public about the mining industry that dominated the Moweaquan economy in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The museum was dedicated on May 25, 1986. It houses a number of artifacts and documents, including tools, newspaper clippings and photographs, and coal specimens from the mine. The museum is free for all visitors and is open seven days a week. A documentary film funded by the Illinois State Library was made in 2008 and can be borrowed from the public library in Moweaqua. The film was written by Ruth Shasteen, edited by Paul A. Brooks, and produced and directed by Andrew R. Moore.

Routing of the loop north of I-20 bypasses Lindale to the west and passes by the west and south sides of Tyler south of I-20. The highway interconnects suburban areas and areas of potential development around Tyler with I-20 and provides local areas easier access to the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex. Currently, the route exists as a undivided two-lane highway stretching from US 69 near Lindale to SH 110 near Whitehouse. According to TxDOT, costs have exceeded $176 million, and the projected total cost for the completion of the route as a divided four-lane highway is still unknown. This proposed extension of Loop 49, the East Texas Hourglass (ETHG), planned as a divided four-lane highway between SH 110 and US 59 near Marshall, includes two additional spur highways and will run through Smith, Gregg, and Harrison Counties. It is designed to ease congestion and provide faster connections between the cities of Tyler, Longview, and Marshall. The highway will adhere to Interstate highway standards. Loop 49 and the East Texas Hourglass are the first major projects of the North East Texas Regional Mobility Authority (NET RMA). Route description Loop 49 begins at an intersection with US 69 north of Lindale. Proceeding south, the highway bypasses Lindale to the west, having interchanges with FM 16 and I-20. Continuing south through the western side of Tyler, Loop 49 has interchanges with SH 64 and SH 31 near Tyler Pounds Regional Airport. Traveling south, Loop 49 interchanges with SH 155 at Noonday. Turning east, Loop 49 meets US 69 on the south side of Tyler, and proceeds to its current terminus with SH 110 near Whitehouse.  History  50px The route number was originally used for Spur 49 from SH 22 in Corsicana to the Corsicana State Orphans' home but was removed from the state highway system on August 4, 1966. Signage originally planned for use along Loop 49 if the road had not been set up for tolling. Plans to construct an outer loop around the city of Tyler, Texas began in the mid-1980s. The original plans called for a freeway to be built but Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) determined that there was a funding shortfall and the road would not likely be built until 2033 using traditional funding. In response, the NET RMA chose to build the highway as a tollway with an electronic toll system. In August 2003, construction began on the first segment (called Segment 1) extending east from SH 155 (Frankston Hwy) in Noonday to US 69 (Broadway Ave) in south Tyler. The road is a two-lane undivided highway, which will ultimately be expanded to a four-lane divided highway. The grand opening of Loop 49 took place on August 17, 2006. Tolling began on November 27, 2006. Construction then continued east, with Segment 2, which extends from US 69 to FM 756 (Paluxy Dr), opening to traffic January 7, 2008. Due to a 2008 budget crisis at TxDOT, construction on additional sections of the tollway was delayed more than two years. In 2010, construction began on Segment 5, which extends from FM 756 to SH 110 in Whitehouse. This section of the tollway, which was funded by Proposition 14 highway bonds, approved by Texas voters in 2003, opened to traffic June 28, 2012 after nearly 29 months of construction, bringing the total length of the loop to . Construction on the western side of Loop 49 began with Segment 3A, which extends from SH 155 (Frankston Hwy) to SH 31 (Chandler Hwy). This segment was constructed using federal funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, after the Texas Transportation Commission approved its status as a stimulus project on March 5, 2009. TxDOT awarded a $37.9 million construction contract three months later on June 10, and construction began in August. Segment 3A opened to traffic November 9, 2012, after approximately 39 months of construction. In an effort to speed completion of the west side of Loop 49 and connect it to Interstate 20, the NET RMA approved a plan in August 2009 to develop Segment 3B, the longest section of the toll road at , using a nontraditional \\"design/build\\" process. On October 28, 2010, the Texas Transportation Commission approved up to $90 million for the construction of Segment 3B through State Infrastructure Bank loans and a toll equity loan. Construction on Segment 3B began on January 21, 2011, and the segment opened to traffic on March 28, 2013, completing the loop from I-20 to SH 110. On February 28, 2013, the Texas Transportation Commission voted to transfer ownership and maintenance of Loop 49 from TxDOT to the NET RMA. Segment 4, also known as the Lindale Relief Route, stretches for from US 69 south to I-20, bypassing the city of Lindale to the west. The environmental coordination stage of planning, with various state and federal approvals was completed, with construction beginning in 2016, and the segment opening to traffic on November 7, 2018. Future The future segments of the East Texas Hourglass are currently in the preliminary planning stages, with no completion timeline currently scheduled. Segment 6 is planned to complete the eastern portion of Loop 49, connecting SH 110 near Whitehouse to I-20 near the Smith- Gregg County line. Segment 6A is planned as a spur running from a junction between Loop 49 and FM 850 near New Chapel Hill to the current junction between US 271 and SH 155 northeast of Tyler. Segment 7 is planned to run northeast from I-20 to US 259 north of Longview. Segment 8 is planned to run from US 259 to US 59 north of Marshall. Segment 8A is planned as another spur running from a point east of a junction between Loop 49 and FM 2879 northeast of Longview to I-20 southeast of Longview.

Growing up and career  Andersson was born in Liverpool, England, on December 10, 1874, to Alfred Carolus Andersson (1840‚Äì1882), a cotton broker, and Elizabeth Ann Falk (maiden; 1851‚Äì1931). The family moved to Kansas City, Missouri, in the early 1880s. Andersson's father died there, and his mother moved the family back to Liverpool, and then, in 1884, to Weimar, Germany, where Andersson attended school for five years. His mother re-married in 1889 to Dr. Henry John Lampe (1844‚Äì1910) and the family returned to Kansas City. She died in San Antonio, Texas, in 1931 at age seventy-nine. Lampe died in Kansas City. Andersson's career in newspapers began during his teenage years when he worked at odd jobs around the shop where his stepfather published a German-language newspaper. He wrote and edited campus publications while a student at Princeton University from 1893 to 1895 and then returned to Kansas City to take a job on the Kansas City World, a Scripps-McRae newspaper. He then moved on to reporting and editing jobs on Scripps papers in St. Louis, Missouri and Chicago, Illinois. In 1898 Andersson reported on the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War from Cuba and Puerto Rico for the United Press, which then appointed him manager of the UP's Kansas City bureau. In 1906 he scouted Texas for a suitable location to start a newspaper for Scripps-McRae. According to newspaper lore, he stopped at a downtown Dallas drugstore, noticed it sold fine cigars, and concluded \\"if those are the cigars the men here favor, this must be a good town.\\" As he contemplated starting a paper in Dallas he learned that another man was in town with the same idea and likewise with Scripps-McRae's tentative promise to back it. Confronting Col. Milton A. McRae, he was told that Scripps-McRae's support would go to the man who got a paper on the street first; Andersson then hastily threw together the four-page first issue of the Dallas Dispatch, deployed boys to sell the paper on the street, and the Dispatch became the Scripps paper in Dallas. In 1911, he inaugurated the Houston Press, a Scripps- McRae newspaper in Houston, Texas. While editing the Press he retained editorship of the Dispatch and continued to live in Dallas. With a 1916 reorganization of Scripps-McRae properties in the South, he became editor of the Memphis Press in Memphis, Tennessee, the Denver Express in Denver, Colorado, and the Oklahoma News in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In 1919, Andersson moved to Cleveland, Ohio, to become general manager of the Newspaper Enterprise Association, a Scripps feature service. In 1921, he left the newspaper business for the first time and moved to San Antonio to enter the cotton business. His absence from newspapering was short-lived, as he returned to Dallas a year later and once again became publisher of the Dispatch, a position he held until retirement in 1937. But a year later Karl Hoblitzelle and others purchased the Dispatch and combined it with the Dallas Journal (which they simultaneously acquired from A. H. Belo Corporation, publisher of The Dallas Morning News) to create the afternoon Dallas Dispatch-Journal, and induced the reluctant Andersson to become its publisher. Andersson finally retired in December 1938. Andersson was tall and spare and had a reserved manner and patrician features. He was described as \\"essentially a kind man, although his was not the heartiness associated with the back-slapper.\\" His newspapers tended to be crusading and somewhat sensational, often publishing several editions daily.  Family  Andersson, on June 18, 1900, in Chicago, married Dorothy Winnifred Smart (maiden; 1876‚Äì1911). Two years later, on June 13, 1913, in Cincinnati, he married Ruth Holmes Harper (1890‚Äì1974), whose father, Jacob Chandler Harper (1858‚Äì1939), was general counsel for the Scripps-McRae newspapers.  Death  Suffering from gradual circulatory failure and failure to completely recover from bronchial pneumonia, Andersson was stricken on a cruise and returned to the La Jolla, California, home of his wife's deceased parents, which the Anderssons had been using as a summer home and where he died on May 11, 1950, at age seventy-five. He had three children, one of whom, a son, was editor of the Memphis Press-Scimitar.

The airport is located approximately from Sydney's central business district. Camden is used as a general aviation overflow airport for the busier Bankstown Airport; and provides facilities for gliding and ballooning. The aerodrome has one grass- and one paved runway and two glider airstrips. It is in the south-west corner of the designated Sydney flight training area. History=Early history A racecourse owned by prominent local grazier Arthur Macarthur-Onslow originally occupied the site of the Camden aerodrome. The shooting of the film Silks and Saddles at the track involved an Avro 504K biplane piloted by Edgar Percival landing on the set, and the occasion led to Macarthur-Onslow's sons Edward, Denzil and Andrew displaying a keen interest in aviation. By 1935, the Macarthur-Onslow family owned several aircraft including a de Havilland Hornet Moth and a Comper Swift which they stored in a shed on the property. The boys established the Macquarie Grove Flying School on the property in 1938, however the operations of the school would be wound back significantly when Edward Macarthur-Onslow, now responsible for Macquarie Grove Aerodrome and the associated flying school, offered the facility to the government following the outbreak of war. World War II Originally a private airstrip, the area that was to become Camden Aerodrome was utilised by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and other Allied air forces during World War II.A C-47 Dakota and crew of No. 243 Squadron RAF at Camden in 1945 Camden airfield hosted Nos. 4, 15, 21, 32 and 78 RAAF Squadrons at various stages during the war. In addition the Central Flying School operated between 1940 and 1942, and a British transport unit, No. 243 Squadron RAF, was based at Camden during the latter part of World War II. Camden was also the No.13 Operational Base. By 1946 the airfield had been returned to its civil status. In May 1942, No. 4 Squadron RAAF moved to Camden from Canberra equipped with CAC Wirraways, but were redeployed to Kingaroy, Queensland in September. No. 15 Squadron RAAF was formed as a maritime patrol unit at Camden on 27 January 1944 equipped with Australian built versions of the Bristol Beaufort torpedo bomber. The squadron maintained detachments at Camden until the end of the war although it was based at other airfields for short periods. No. 21 Squadron RAAF arrived at Camden in January 1944 from New Guinea to re-equip with Consolidated B-24 Liberators. The conversion was complete by July and the squadron departed to forward operating bases in northern Australia. The Lockheed Hudson equipped No. 32 Squadron RAAF deployed to Camden in November 1942. While stationed at Camden the squadron performed anti-submarine patrols and was re-equipped with Beaufort torpedo bombers. The base hosted the squadron until May 1944 when it was redeployed to Lowood, Queensland. No. 78 Squadron RAAF, equipped with P-40 Kittyhawk fighters was formed on 20 July 1943 at RAAF Base Camden. The squadron trained here until it was operational and deployed to Kiriwina Island in November. No. 83 Squadron RAAF equipped with Australian built CAC Boomerang fighters arrived at Camden from Gove in the Northern Territory in August 1944. The squadron had moved to nearby Menangle by early 1945. From late 1944 until April 1946 Camden was the main base for No. 300 Group RAF, which flew transport aircraft in support of the British Pacific Fleet. The Camden War Cemetery, located in the Camden General Cemetery, contains twenty three graves comprising four Australian Army, two Royal Air Force and seventeen Royal Australian Air Force personnel. Most of those buried here died in three separate air training accidents. Satellite airfields * The Oaks Airfield * Menangle Airfield Post war In 1946, ownership of the airport was transferred to the Department of Civil Aviation who oversaw the development of further civil aviation infrastructure on the site including the sealing of runway 06/24. By 1962, a control tower had been built on the site, and in 1978 the primary taxiway providing access between the apron and runway was sealed. In 1988, the airport was transferred to the Federal Airports Corporation and throughout the 1990s further improvements were made to the system of taxiways and aprons to improve aircraft circulation and traffic flow. Major works in 1997 saw all sealed aprons, runways and taxiways resurfaced. In 1968 the Camden Museum of Aviation was established at Camden Airport. It moved to another location at Harrington Park in 1976. The FAC was wound down in 1998 and Camden was transferred along with Bankstown, the former Hoxton Park Airport and Kingsford Smith Airport to Sydney Airports Corporation Limited, but at this stage was still a government controlled enterprise. During the 2000 Summer Olympics the airport was used to handle overflow general aviation traffic. In 2003, it was controversially sold by the Australian government to a private company, along with Bankstown and Hoxton Park. It is now mostly used by trainee pilots for flying schools, Phoenix Aero Club and Flying School, the Australian Air League, No. 3 Wing Australian Air Force Cadets, Scouts Australia NSW Air Activity Centre, several gliding clubs, hot air ballooning and other forms of general aviation. The airport was used as the car-testing track for the television series Top Gear Australia.  Radio procedures  Camden operates as an ICAO Class D airport from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm. At other times it is a Common Traffic Advisory Frequency airport.

It states that the mass transport of sand is proportional to the third power of the friction velocity. Under steady conditions, this implies that mass transport is proportional to the third power of the excess of the wind speed (at any fixed height over the sand surface) over the minimum wind speed that is able to activate and sustain a continuous flow of sand grains. The formula was derived by Bagnold Bagnold, R.A. 1936. The movement of desert sand. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A 157(892):594-620. in 1936 and later published in his book The Physics of Blown Sand and Desert Dunes in 1941.Bagnold, R.A. 1941. The physics of blown sand and desert dunes. London: Methuen, 265 pp. Wind tunnel and field experiments suggest that the formula is basically correct.

He worked for the magazine Vismi Sadi until it closed in 1921, and then founded the cultural magazine Kumar. Life Ravishankar Raval was born on 1 August 1892 in Bhavnagar (now in Gujarat, India). His father Mahashanakar Raval was an officer in the British Communication Service. He spent his childhood in several towns as his father was transferred from one place to another. He wrote that he inherited his artistic instincts from his mother. He graduated from high school in 1909. During his first university year, at the local Arts College, his principal asked him to paint the stage sets for the college drama festival. He advised him to join arts by his Parsi professor Sanjana who was pleased with his artistic skills. Against his fathers non-approval, he joined Sir J. J. School of Art, Bombay. He was trained under Cecil Burns, the principal of J. J. School. Though a promising student of the academic naturalism taught at the J. J. School and a budding portrait painter, Raval gave up these influences to embrace the revival of Indian art that was then gaining ground. In the spirit of cultural nationalism, he held on to these ideas, despite harsh criticism, such as when the Rajput-art-style painting 'Bilwamangal' for which he won the Bombay Art Society gold medal was dismissed by a Parsi artist as 'a printed label on mill cloth' He received Mayo Gold Medal at Sir J. J. School of Art in 1916. Career Cover of 1916 issue of Visami Sadi. Cover Art by M. V. Dhurandhar. In 1915, Raval met a prominent journalist Hajji Mohammad Alarakhiya, who was looking for a young artist-illustrator for his new cultural magazine Visami Sadi (The Twentieth Century), and joined him. He moved to Ahmedabad and started an art school in 1919. He worked for Visami Sadi until its closing with the accidental death of Haji Mohammad in 1921. From Visami Sadi, he was inspired to start new cultural magazine Kumar at Ahmedabad in 1924, which is still published. The magazine is said to have made a great impact on Gujarati arts, and was known for its illustrations and experiments in typography. He had drawn the famous painting of the trial of Mahatma Gandhi's trial on charge of sedition on 18 March 1922 in the Circuit House of Ahmedabad where no cameras were allowed. In 1927, he conducted a month-long art study of the 1st century frescos of the Ajanta Caves. In 1936, he went on three months art tour to Japan. He had participated in annual conference of Indian National Congress in Haripura in 1938 where he painted paintings. He visited Rabindranath Tagore's university, Santiniketan in 1941. He was appointed as the President of Art Society of India and the President of Bombay Art Society in 1941. In 1948, he joined Russian artist Nicholas Roerich at his Kulu art center as the house guest. He participated in All India Art Conference at Calcutta in 1951. He went on art tour to Soviet Russia in 1952. Other noteworthy work includes the remarkable artwork in Chandapoli, a Gujarati children's magazine and Kailash ma Ratri (A night at Mt.Kailash). Raval illustrated Bawlana Parakramo (1939), a Gujarati adaptation of the Pinocchio story by Hansa Mehta. He also drew many paintings of historical figures such as Narsinh Mehta, Mirabai, Hemchandracharya, Chandra Kaumudi, Akho which became cultural image of the characters. He is also well known for painting the characters of Kanaiyalal Munshi's novels. He had designed quasi- realistic sets of Narsinh Mehta, the first Gujarati talkie film. His autobiography Gujarat Ma Kala Na Pagran which was reissued in 2010 with some of his works in it. He died on 9 December 1977 at his home \\"Chitrakoot\\" in Ahmedabad after brief illness. Style He evolved his own rich style, inspired by the Indian classical painting traditions. He was influenced by Raja Ravi Verma's religious oleographs. He was influenced by Tagore's informal open studios which influenced his Gujarat Chitra Kala Sangh. He was given the title of Kalaguru, the master of art, by Gujarati author Kakasaheb Kalelkar for his contribution in art in Gujarat. His art school produced several notable artists of India such as Kanu Desai. Recognition Bust of Ravishankar Raval at Ravishankar Raval Kala Bhavan, Ahmedabad During his career, Raval received several awards and medals. He received Mayo Gold Medal at Sir J. J.

The sixty-foot granite wall is a remnant of the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad Bridge which spanned the James River for much of the nineteenth century. The climbing area is located on the south side of the James River and is accessible by foot from the north via Brown's Island and the T. Tyler Potterfield Memorial bridge, also known as the Brown's Island Dam Walk. There are also two parking lots that allow walk-up access from the south; one on W 7th Street and Semmes Avenue, and the Floodwall parking lot located at the south end of the Mayo Bridge. The routes offered at Manchester Wall, and its 3 adjacent pillars, are superb for recreational and experienced climbers alike.  Routes and Difficulty  Manchester has a total of 43 routes, ranging from the difficulty of 5.4 to 5.11a, most averaging around 5.9. The easiest route at Manchester is located on the back of the first pillar (i.e. side closest to the James River). The name of this route is called affectionately The Ladder, or Potty Training. It is rated a 5.4 and is perfect for those who have never rock climbed before. However, it is easiest to have an experience climber lead Bolts From Heaven, a 5.5 with arete on. The lead climber can then send a top rope down The Ladder from the anchors at the top of the pillar. Bolts From Heaven is a great practice run for climbers learning to lead. Having a total of 7 bolts, plus the two top bolts, makes it the safest first lead at Manchester. Also, this climb is perfect for anchoring any of the other 8 routes on Pillar #1 with relative ease. The other routes on the pillar have fewer bolts for sport climbing, making a ground-fall more likely should a mistake be made. A fun, but difficult climb can be found on Pillar #2. McKenna, or The Crack, is literally that, a crack running up the pillar. It offers a variety of handholds such as crimpers, side-pulls, and under-clings. It has reliable footholds, so it is a great challenge for climbers to get practice with different clings. For the more advanced climbers, The Wall is where the most effort is put forward into climbing. The pillars have a slightly sloped incline, making balancing and standing much easier for climbers. However, The Wall is an almost vertical ascent. It also makes the effort more difficult because of its much longer route lengths. The pillars are relatively short compared to the towering wall. The most challenging route on The Wall is Tendonitis, rated at 5.10d. Its almost smooth surface and lack of foot- and handholds are a real challenge. Finger pockets and smearing are all that a climber gets on this longest route. However, lucky for the climbers, the first half is a chimney, so at the top of it is a resting location for climbers to sit and rest before continuing up the other half to the top-most point on the wall.  The Wall  *Total Routes: 20 *Lowest Rating: 5.4 (Gutter Ball, arete on, top rope) *Highest rating: 5.10d (Tendonitis, sport/top rope) *Easiest Lead: No need to lead for most of these, there is a path going up to the top of the wall for hikers. Climbers can reach over the edge to most anchors.

However, as of July 2006, bolts have been placed, so it can probably now be sport climbed. Until climbing is regular on this pillar, though, it will be treated with traditional gear only routes and ratings. *Total Routes: 6 *Lowest Rating: 5.8+ (Cary's Route, arete off, trad gear only) *Highest Rating: 5.10c (Blair Witch, arete off, trad gear only) *Easiest Lead: Unknown Climbing areas of the United States Sports venues in Richmond, Virginia ","title":"Manchester Wall"},{"id":"6331203","text":"Marc Alexander Newfield (born October 19, 1972) is an American former professional baseball player from to for the Seattle Mariners, San Diego Padres, and Milwaukee Brewers of the Major League Baseball(MLB).

It was named for TWA executive Ernest R. Breech. TWA Breech Academy 1970 History TWA opened the academy on December 3, 1969, on a , three-building campus in Overland Park, Kansas at 6300 Lamar Ave. to train women to be stewardesses and air hostesses. The academy was so popular that other airlines sent their own flight attendants to the school. Previously TWA had done its training at its TWA Corporate Headquarters' Building in downtown Kansas City. In 1972, TWA started interviewing young men for the position that was previously exclusively held by women. The name \\"Hostess\\" thus became \\"Flight Attendant\\" because of the addition of male employees to that position. Two men were in the first class started in April 1972. In the years to follow, hundreds of men would eventually graduate the Breech Academy as Flight Attendants. Training facilities It was a \\"state-of-the-art\\" training school for flight attendants, surpassing any and all other airline schools in United States at that time. The training included being taught inside actual interiors of airplanes such as 747s, L-1011s, and others. This included intense training of the flight attendants on food and beverage service and emergency procedures which included shimmying down a deflated ramp from to the ground from the plane's emergency door hatch. Not to mention the physical inspections which included weekly weigh-ins. There were modern classrooms, air-conditioned and well-lit with oval-type seating for the \\"book\\"-type learning. Rooming facilities The academy was renowned for its flight attendant dormitories which were in \\"pods\\" with decorative themes such as \\"Africa\\", \\"Asia\\" and other regional themes. In the African theme, there were leopard skins, bows, and other African type objects on the walls of the living room \\"pod\\". Each \\"pod\\" had a sunken living room; or \\"Common Area\\" with 10 individual dorm-type rooms for two student flight attendants. These \\"pods\\" were grouped so that you could easily visit each dorm room while walking a full circle. In the evenings, many of the flight attendants in their \\"pod\\" would converge into the common area room to mingle.  Graduation  At graduation for the flight attendants, the parents and visitors were invited to watch the graduation ceremony taking place on the school stage as the flight attendants accepted their \\"wings\\".

Kolenati was born in Prague where he completed elementary school and high school, then after graduation from the Medical Faculty of Charles University as a student of the natural sciences, especially botany and entomology, he continued as an assistant in botany. In 1842 he moved to Russia as an assistant in zoology at the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences. From 1842-1845 he participated in explorations of the Caucasus, ranging from the Azov Sea to Nagorno-Karabakh, and later conducted a survey of the lower Don River. In 1845 Kolenati returned to Prague, where he was named an Associate Professor of Natural History. In 1848 he played an active part in the revolutionary events of the time, for which he was subsequently arrested. After his release from prison, he gave lectures in mineralogy and zoology at the Prague Polytechnic Institute and worked as a professor of natural history at the Lesser gymnasium. In 1848 he co-founded the Lotos Science Association, and was appointed full professor of natural science and technology at the Polytechnic Institute at Brno. In this department during his tenure significantly expanded its natural history collections, especially its mineralogical collections. He died while on a research trip to Pradƒõd and is buried in Little Mor√°vka. Kolenati was a member of the Royal Czech Society of Sciences, published more than 50 entomological works, and was also considered an expert on bats. His collection of beetles from the first half of the 19th century has become one of the foundations of the National Museum's entomological collection in Prague. Bibliography *Kolenati, F.

She previously played for professional clubs in Sweden and the United States. Formiga holds many international records as a member of the Brazil women's national football team, being the only player present in all Olympic Games tournaments of women's football since the first edition at the 1996 Summer Olympics, and a record for appearing at seven different FIFA Women's World Cup tournaments. Club career Born in Salvador, Formiga was born during a period when it had become illegal for women to play football in Brazil. Formiga began playing football at the age of 12. She has cited Dunga, captain of the male Brazilian team that won the 1994 FIFA World Cup as the biggest influence on her playing style. She earned the nickname Formiga, which means ant in Portuguese, as a teenager because of her unselfish style of play which reminded fellow players of the way ants worked together as a colony. Formiga played in the Swedish Damallsvenskan as a member of Malm√∂ FF Dam, and for both Santa Isabel and Saad in her homeland of Brazil. Formiga was the first overall pick for the newly inaugurated Women's Professional Soccer (WPS) league in the United States in the 2008 WPS International Draft, selected by FC Gold Pride of Santa Clara, California. Formiga started 15 of her 16 games for Gold Pride in their inaugural season in 2009. The following season, Formiga played for Chicago Red Stars, alongside compatriot Cristiane. In 2011, Formiga returned to her country to play for S√£o Jos√©. International career Formiga first played for Brazilian women's national team at the age of 17, as part of the squad for the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup, playing as a substitute. The following year, during the inaugural tournament for women's football at the 1996 Summer Olympics, she became a regular starter in the Brazilian team. Formiga and Pretinha were the only two Brazilian players who participated in the first four Olympic Games tournaments of women's football, winning the silver medal in both 2004 and 2008 ‚Äì both finals lost to the United States. She returned in the 2012 and 2016 tournaments, setting an outright record as the only player present in all six editions of the Olympics tournament. The 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup is Formiga‚Äôs record-breaking seventh consecutive tournament appearance; Lothar Matth√§us, Antonio Carbajal, and Rafael M√°rquez share the record of five consecutive appearances in the men's competition. Along the way, Formiga's Brazil reached third place in 1999 and were runners- up to Birgit Prinz's Germany in 2007. Formiga became the competition's oldest goalscorer with a goal against South Korea on 9 June 2015. She was 37 years, three months and six days old. Formiga also won the gold medal in three editions of the Pan American Games, 2003, 2007 and 2015, and winning the silver in 2011 when Brazil were beaten by Canada.

She is currently Slade Professor and Director of the Slade School of Fine Art in London, England.  Biographical notes  Collins studied Fine Art at Slade School where she graduated as a Bachelor of Arts with Honours in 1987. In the early 1990s she studied at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago after receiving a Fulbright Scholarship. Returning to England, she was appointed to set up the Electronic Media department at the Slade in 1995. The UCL Slade Centre for Electronic Media in Fine Art was founded in the same year. In 2005 she was appointed Head of the Undergraduate Fine Art Media area at Slade, in 2010 she became Head of Department and Director of the School. In 2013 she was appointed Slade Professor of Fine Art. As an artist Collins mainly works with digital media. Her 2002-03 project Tate in Space was nominated for a BAFTA Award in 2004. Susan Collins has exhibited in the UK, Canada, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Turkey, Israel, Tasmania, Thailand, Mexico and Peru.  Works of art (selection)  In Conversation (1997-2001): an internet project in which users could talk to people in the street via an animated mouth. The project won the 2012 Dutch Kunstbeeld thesis prize. Classroom of the Future (2001-2005): a classroom design for Mossbrook Special School in Sheffield, a collaboration with architect Sarah Wigglesworth, which won an RSA Art for Architecture award. Collins added an interactive environment to Wigglesworth' building, consisting of a wildlife surveillance system, a camera obscura and an audio environment called the 'ballpool'. Tate in Space (2002): Collins invented this tongue-in- cheek project that aimed to establish a branch of the Tate Galleries in outer space. Part of the project, that included a spoof website, was the launch of the 'Tate Satellite' which was visible from earth. Underglow (2005-2006): the project consisted of illuminations of a number of drains in the vicinity of Guildhall Yard, King Street and Queen Street in the City of London, which were visible from dusk to dawn during the winter of 2005-06. The project was commissioned by the City of London Corporation and Modus Operandi as part of the 'Light Up Queen Street' programme. Fenlandia, Glenlandia, Harewood (2005-2014): a series of online project time-coding landscapes and cityscapes. The original commission was by Film and Video Umbrella and Norwich School of Art and Design. For 12 months a webcam was placed on the roof of the Anchor Inn, a 17th-century coaching inn in Sutton Gault, Cambridgeshire, part of the area known as Silicon Fen. The installation stored a single pixel of the recorded webcam image every second, building up a new image from left to right, top to bottom in horizontal bands. Thus the final image was built up from individual pixels collected over a total of approximately 21 hours and 20 minutes. This process was repeated for 365 days, from May 2004 until May 2005, after which the project was moved to Cambourne (also in Silicon Fenn), Greenham Common and Bracknell, Berkshire (both in the M4 corridor. Similar projects took place in Loch Faskally, Perthshire, Scotland from 2005 until 2007 (Glenlandia), at Harewood House near Leeds in 2008, and in Lambeth, London in 2013 and 2014. Seascape (2009): a digital work that consists of a series of gradually unfolding digital seascapes, featured at the De La Warr Pavilion in Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex. These digital seascapes were captured in real time by webcams installed at five key coastal vantage points on the South Coast between Margate and Portsmouth. The webcams were sited at each location for up to a year before the start of the show, recording fluctuations in the light that are a characteristic feature of the English coastline.

The award was initiated by Lettre International in Berlin, and is organized by the Foundation Lettre International Award, a joint partnership between Lettre International and the Aventis Foundation. The Goethe-Institut also cooperates with the project. A polyglot jury of experienced writers representing eleven of the major linguistic regions of the world seeks the best international texts in the genre and decides on a shortlist of seven, eventually choosing three winners from among them. The members of the jury are appointed by the organizer. In addition, an advisory committee of distinguished writers lends its moral and intellectual backing to the Lettre Ulysses Award. Members of the committee have included G√ºnter Grass, the German writer and winner of the 1999 Nobel Prize in Literature, the Polish reportage author Ryszard Kapu≈õci≈Ñski, the French ethnologist Jean Malaurie, and the Belarusian writer Svetlana Aleksievich. The Lettre Ulysses Award is the first world prize in the reportage genre. The initiave ended in 2007, after the contract between the Foundation Lettre International Award and the Aventis Foundation ended and the foundation did not succeed in finding a new partner. Award ceremony and prizes The prize winners are announced at a public award ceremony in Berlin on the Saturday before the opening of the international Frankfurt Book Fair. The winners of the first, second and third prizes are given cash awards amounting to $50,000, $30,000 and US$20,000, respectively. Residencies in Berlin are awarded to the other four finalists. Mission The Lettre Ulysses Award aims to: Nomination and selection process The jury is composed of writers and journalists who work within the reportage genre. Their conference language is English, but they are native speakers drawn from the world's largest linguistic regions and as such guarantee the broadest possible language base. Each jury member is able to make up to two nominations for the award. Although it is likely that jury members will nominate from their own language group, in practice they can nominate works written in whichever languages they read. The composition of the jury and the languages represented are subject to partial annual change. Each jury member justifies his or her nominations in a written proposal accompanied by extracts of each text. These are, if necessary, translated into English and sent out to each jury member. Following the nominations, the first jury meeting is held. The number of nominees is reduced and a shortlist is drawn up after discussions centering on the criteria: relevance of subject; originality; complexity; credibility and authenticity; structure; language and style; and whatever other elements make a particular work outstanding. The shortlist contains seven texts. These texts are then translated in their entirety, if necessary, and sent to all jury members. The final decisions are made after all candidate texts have been entirely and thoroughly read by each and every jury member. Past winners=2003 * 1st prize.

Previously known as the St√§dtische Strassenbahn Z√ºrich (StStZ), the organisation was founded in 1896 and adopted its current name in 1950. The VBZ owns and operates trams, trolleybuses, buses, and a funicular. It also operates, but does not own, a further funicular, a rack railway, and the Stadtbahn Glattal light rail system. All of VBZ's passenger services are operated within the tariff and ticketing system provided by the cantonal public transport authority Z√ºrcher Verkehrsverbund (ZVV). The ZVV tariff also covers other passenger transport services in and around the city, including the Z√ºrich S-Bahn, although these are not operated by the VBZ.  History  The mix of tram routes in 1899 The St√§dtische Strassenbahn Z√ºrich (StStZ) came into existence in 1896, when the City of Z√ºrich purchased the Elektrische Strassenbahn Z√ºrich (ESZ). However privately owned tram systems had operated in the city since 1882, and private and public operation of tram systems within the city continued in parallel until 1931, with the StStZ gradually acquiring the private sector companies. In 1927, the StStZ introduced its first motor bus route, and in 1939 this was joined by the first trolleybus route. In 1940 the StStZ started a modernisation of its trams, introducing the first prototypes of the Swiss Standard Tram. Despite Switzerland's neutrality, the economic effects of the second world war slowed down the program, but by 1953 the VBZ had taken delivery of 177 such trams. A station built for the abortive U-Bahn In 1950 the StStZ changed its name to the Verkehrsbetriebe der Stadt Z√ºrich (VBZ) to reflect the broader nature of its services. This name was further refined to Verkehrsbetriebe Z√ºrich in 1978, with the use of the name VBZ Z√ºri-Linie in some marketing contexts. In 1962, a proposal for a metro or U-Bahn network was rejected by the voters of Z√ºrich, a rejection that was repeated in 1973. This notwithstanding, several stretches of U-Bahn were built but never opened. Today, one such stretch is used by the VBZ tram network, whilst another is used as the terminus of the Sihltal Z√ºrich Uetliberg Bahn (SZU) at Z√ºrich Hauptbahnhof station. In 1990, the VBZ became a partner of the Zurich Transport Network or Z√ºrcher Verkehrsverbund (ZVV), a body which coordinates public transport provision and tariffs throughout the canton of Z√ºrich. In 2006 the first phase of the Stadtbahn Glattal opened, with further phases opening in 2008 and 2010. In 2011 the city tram network was extended by the opening of the Z√ºrich West project.  Operations = Trams  A pair of two-section Tram 2000 trams on typical VBZ street track Trams make an important contribution to public transport in the city, with the tram network serving most city neighbourhoods, and are the backbone of public transport within the city. Most of the tram routes run from suburb to suburb via the city centre. The VBZ owns the tram infrastructure within the city, and operates trams both over its own infrastructure and over the infrastructure of the Stadtbahn Glattal, a light rail system situated to the north of the city and owned by the Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal (VBG). Whilst some of the routes operated over the Stadtbahn Glattal are branded as VBG routes, all such services are actually operated by the VBZ under contract to the VBG. The joint tram network of the VBZ and VBG comprises 15 separate routes. The network operates on meter gauge track, electrified using overhead line at 600 V DC. The VBZ infrastructure is largely street based, with varying degrees of segregation from other street traffic but little use of dedicated rights of way for the trams with the notable exception of a tram tunnel in north-east Z√ºrich that was originally built for an abortive metro system, and modified for tram usage. By contrast, on VBG infrastructure, VBZ trams operate on long stretches of dedicated track. Bombardier Cobra low floor tram in VBG livery on Stadtbahn Glattal right of way The independent Forchbahn (FB) railway uses VBZ trackwork to reach the centre of Z√ºrich from the eastern edge of the city. The FB trains operate largely in the street for this section of their route, sharing track with VBZ tram routes, but are categorised as part of the city's S-Bahn railway network rather than as part of the tram network. Two membership associations, the Tram-Museum Z√ºrich and the Aktion Pro S√§chsitram, also use VBZ tracks to operate occasional heritage tram services. The VBZ owns 313 tram vehicles, which between them cover over 16 million vehicle-kilometres per year. Of these, 88 are modern low-floor Bombardier Cobra trams delivered between 2001 and 2010. All the remaining trams in regular passenger service are of the Tram 2000 design, of which 201 vehicles were delivered between 1976 and 1992. Whilst the Tram 2000 is a high-floor design, 23 trams have been rebuilt with the addition of a low-floor centre section. Unlike the five- section Cobras, which normally only operate singly, the Tram 2000 vehicles are composed of one, two, or (in the case of rebuilt units) three sections, and in most cases operate in multiple. The tram network carries 202 million passengers trips per year, adding up to 368 million passenger-kilometres.  Trolleybuses  A Mercedes-Benz O405 GTZ trolleybus The city's tram routes are supported by 6 trolleybus routes, with a total route length of . As with the city's tram routes, most of the trolleybus routes run from suburb to suburb, although their penetration of the city centre is less complete than the trams. Like the tram network, the trolleybus network is electrified using overhead line at 600 V DC, and shares a common electrical supply infrastructure. Service is provided by 80 trolleybuses, which between them cover over 5 million vehicle-kilometres per year. All the city's trolleybuses are articulated buses, with 17 being extra-long double-articulated vehicles. All the double-articulated vehicles, along with a further 18 of the single- articulated units, are low floor. The trolleybus network carries 54 million passengers trips per year, adding up to 119 million passenger-kilometres.  Motor buses  Neoplan N 4516 motor bus The VBZ also operates 60 motor bus routes. The bus routes can be broken down into urban routes (18 routes), district routes (9 local minibus operated feeder routes within the city) and regional routes (33 routes in the region around the city). The VBZ operates 181 motor buses, of which 85 are standard buses, 73 are articulated buses and 23 are minibuses. With the exception of 8 articulated buses, all motor buses are low floor. VBZ buses on the urban routes cover just under 6 million vehicle-kilometres a year per year, with district routes adding a further 1 million vehicle-kilometres and regional routes contributing 2 million vehicle- kilometres. Additionally, much of the regional service is provided by contractors operating on behalf of the VBZ, with such services covering a further 4 million vehicle-kilometers per year. The urban motor bus network carries 37 million passengers trips per year, adding up to 75 million passenger-kilometres. The district bus network carries 2 million passengers trips per year, adding up to 3 million passenger-kilometres. The regional bus network carries 20 million passengers trips per year, adding up to 62 million passenger-kilometres.  Funiculars and rack railways  The Seilbahn Rigiblick The VBZ operates two funiculars and one rack railway within the city of Z√ºrich: * The Rigiblick funicular, in the north-east of the city, connects a lower station served by tram and trolley bus routes with an upper station at Rigiblick on the Z√ºrichberg hill. It is both owned and operated by the VBZ. * The Polybahn funicular, in the centre of the city, links the city centre with the university. It is operated by the VBZ on behalf of its owners, the banking group UBS AG. * The Dolderbahn rack railway, in Z√ºrich's eastern suburbs, connects a lower station served by trams with an upper station adjacent to the Dolder Grand Hotel. It is operated by the VBZ on behalf of its owners, the Dolderbahn-Betriebs AG.  Tariffs and tickets  Ticket machine All services operated by the VBZ operate on a proof-of-payment system. Passengers are required to purchase a ticket before boarding any vehicle. Passengers may board through any door and are not required to show tickets on boarding. Tickets may be purchased from machines found at all of the VBZ's tram stops, and many bus stops. At bus stops without ticket machines, passengers without tickets must board through the front door and purchase a ticket from the driver. Ticket checks are randomly carried out by roving teams of fare inspectors, and penalties are imposed on passengers found without a valid ticket. VBZ's passenger services are operated within the tariff and ticketing system provided by the cantonal public transport authority Z√ºrcher Verkehrsverbund (ZVV). This system covers the whole of the canton of Z√ºrich and thus covers travel on services provided by many other operators, and includes the Z√ºrich S-Bahn suburban rail network. Free transfer is permitted between different vehicles, routes, modes and operators, provided a ticket valid for the whole journey is held. The ZVV system is zonal in nature, with fares for individual journeys set by the zones the journey passes through. Not all zones are equal, with higher fares being charged for travel in some zones. The whole of the city of Z√ºrich is within a single zone, but as some VBZ routes travel beyond the city boundaries, a multi-zone ticket is needed for some VBZ journeys. Both single journey and day tickets are available, as are a number of passes with longer validities.  Other activities  Besides its passenger transport activities, VBZ, jointly with the city refuse and recycling department ERZ, operates the cargo tram to collect bulky waste. The cargo tram serves 9 different collection points around Z√ºrich, calling at each on different days of the month. The collected refuse is taken to a specially constructed siding at the ERZ yard adjacent to the Werdh√∂lzli tram terminus. VBZ also offers various services such as the hire of heritage trams, engineering and repair services using its well-equipped and modern workshops and also transport consulting services. In 1927, a group of VBZ employees founded their own football club called FC VBZ. As of 2020, the club is still active and competes in the corporate league.

Later, he became head monk of Daitoku-ji. He was Dharma successor to Oda Sess≈ç R≈çshi, who was also a disciple of Got≈ç Zuigan R≈çshi and who succeeded him as abbot of Daitoku-ji. He had a number of Western students, most importantly Shaku Daijo and Ursula Jarand, both students of many years at Daishu-in in Kyoto. Shaku Daijo was there ordained as a Zen monk in 1979. Together with Ursula Jarand, Daijo built Daishu-in West in Humboldt County in Northern California, which was inaugurated by S≈çk≈ç Morinaga as a Zen Temple of the Myoshin-ji line. The Roshi also made annual visits of one or two weeks each Summer to England to teach at the Buddhist Society's annual summer school. In 1984 he ordained Venerable Myokyo-ni, head of the Zen Centre closely affiliated to the London- based Buddhist Society. Myokyo-ni was Irmgard Schloegl, an Austrian woman who had trained at Daitoku-ji while he was head monk there and whose own direct teachers (Sess≈ç R≈çshi and Sojun R≈çshi) were now no longer alive. He also inaugurated her London training place Shobo-an as a Zen Temple, in the Daitoku-ji line, where the teachings of S≈çk≈ç, Sess≈ç and Sojun continue to be practiced. Daishu-in West is the main training place in America where The Roshi's teaching and practice of traditional Rinzai Zen may be followed.

In 1913, he started a parochial school for the children of the parish, and asked the Sisters of Mercy to staff it. Father Myer purchased a colonial mansion known as the Tiffany Estate in October 1917. The mansion, which was the home of the manager of the Laurel Mills, was located just west of a public high school, now the Laurel Boys and Girls Club. A remnant of the original circular driveway can still be seen. The mansion was modified by the addition of a frame wing to the south side of the main structure, in order to accommodate a convent, school and boarding rooms for girls. The school drew pupils from a wide geographic area. In 1920 Father Myer purchased additional land close to the Academy with the intention of opening a high school in September 1921. He applied for additional Sisters of Mercy, but they were unable to supply the desired number of teachers. Thus, the Sisters of Mercy withdrew from Laurel in 1921. The Sisters of St. Joseph of Chestnut Hill Pennsylvania staffed the elementary and high school from 1921 to 1934. In 1934, under the direction of Mother de Pazzi Meurer, the American Province of the Missionary Sisters of the Catholic Apostolate (Pallottines), acquired ownership of the property and took over the administration of the schools. As well-educated and experienced teachers, the Pallottine Sisters brought with them an innovative and professional character to the schools, which continues to this day. Within two years, expansion was necessary for the boarding house. Upon completion, the accommodations for boarders were increased from fourteen to fifty. In 1938 the co-educational Academy, under the principalship of Sister Bede Kurth, SAC, received accreditation from the State of Maryland. By that year enrollment had risen from 23 in 1934 to 179. In 1949 the Academy added two new classrooms, but by 1957 the school had outgrown itself again. The entire eighteenth century mansion was razed and construction of the present high school and day care building was begun. It was thought at that time that the new facility, with a capacity for about four hundred students and residence for thirty sisters, would end all of the space problems for the future. The new building also brought a change in the name from St. Mildred's Academy to Pallotti High School in honor of the founder of the Pallottines.

Cairn located within the Garden at The Smith Museum and Art Gallery. Stirling Smith Art Gallery and Museum is an institution based in Stirling, Central Scotland, dedicated to the promotion of cultural and historical heritage and the arts, from a local scale to nationally and beyond. It is also known locally by its original name of \\"The Smith Institute\\".  Introduction  The Stirling Smith Art Gallery and Museum ‚Äì formerly The Smith Institute ‚Äì has played a very special part in the history of Stirling since its foundation in 1874. Established by the bequest of artist Thomas Stuart Smith (1815‚Äì1869) on land supplied by the Burgh of Stirling, it is an historic public-private partnership which has continued to the present day. It was founded as a gallery of mainly contemporary art, with museum and library reading room ‚Äòfor the benefit of the inhabitants of Stirling, Dunblane and Kinbuck‚Äô. Today, it functions as a gallery, museum and cultural centre for the Stirling area. It is the repository for the historical artefacts and paintings of Stirlingshire, at the same time offering exhibition opportunities for contemporary artists. Over twenty community groups meet regularly in its lecture theatre, and a caf√© and biodiversity garden are among its newest attractions. According to the Art Journal of 1896 the Smith did ‚Äúa good work of quiet, unostentatious usefulness‚Äù. It has continued to do this and often the public do not recognise the Smith's collections when they see them. They are used to illustrate many promotional brochures for Stirling and Scotland, from simple leaflets to books and the prestigious City Bid document of 2001. Images from the collection are also used in displays in visitor centres, including the Wallace Monument, throughout the area, and in the pages of national newspapers and in history books. From the beginning, the Smith has had a collection of considerable historic and artistic significance. Although specialist publications for different exhibitions and aspects of the collection have been issued over the last twenty years, there has been no attempt at issuing a general catalogue since 1934.  Smith history  When the writer and former suffragette Eunice Murray made her impassioned plea for Scottish folk museums, it was in the wake of the Second World War. She saw the establishment of museums as an essential feature of a peaceful and civilised society, and being familiar with Continental folk museums, regretted their absence in Scotland. The Garden of Stirling Art Gallery. At this time, the Smith Institute was already 70 years old and had a large collection of folk life material relating to lighting, heating, cooking, spinning and weaving, agriculture and Stirling life in times past. Its use as a billet for troops in both World Wars curtailed its potential and kept it closed, in the latter instance, until 1948. The rest of the twentieth century was spent in repairing the damage and recovering from the war, and none of the other rural communities to whom Eunice Murray was appealing found the resources to set up additional museums. Otherwise, Stirlingshire might well have had museums in Aberfoyle, Bannockburn, Callendar, Cowie, Doune, Dunmore, Fallin, Gargunnock, Killearn, Killin, Kippen, Plean, St. Ninians and Thornhill. The circumstances were right in Dunblane, where the museum was established in 1943. At present, only the Stirling Smith, Dunblane Museum and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Museum operate within the vast 2,200 square kilometres of the Stirling Council area. The Stirling Smith has had a chequered history of 130 years which is worth examining in detail. The founder, Thomas Stuart Smith was an artist who wanted the art gallery element of his Institute to predominate. The Smith Institute first opened to the public on 11 August 1874. It was an occasion for great celebration in Stirling, and the shops in the town closed at noon to allow people to attend the opening. Nevertheless, there were some mixed feelings, for Thomas Stuart Smith, had died in 1869 and the location of the building was felt by many people to be too far away from the old town. At the opening ceremony, Provost Christie refuted criticism of the location by pointing out that ‚Äòfive or ten minutes walk would bring any one to the Institute from the most distant part of the Burgh‚Äô and that the site was chosen on environmental grounds ‚Äòfree from the noise and bustle and free from the dirt, dust and smoke, so that the students of art, science and literature could pursue their studies there unmolested and free from annoyance‚Äô. It was perhaps thanks to Provost Christie that the organisation came into being at all, for Thomas Stuart Smith‚Äôs first thoughts were to leave his money to the Artists‚Äô Benevolent Association.  Thomas Stuart Smith (1815-1869)  Stained Glass Window in Stirling Art Gallery Thomas Stuart Smith's uncle supplied funding so that he could travel and paint in Italy starting in 1840. By the end of that decade he was having his work accepted by both the Salon des Beaux Arts in Paris and the Royal Academy in London. In 1849 Alexander Smith died and eventually Smith's new inheritance enabled him to create an art collection at a studio in Fitzroy Square that included his own work. He decided to create an Institute in Stirling to house his new collection. He drew up plans for a library, museum and a reading room. He signed the trust into existence in November 1869 with himself, James Barty, the Provost of Stirling, and A. W. Cox, a fellow artist, as trustees. He was prevented however from seeing his plans fulfilled as he died the next month in Avignon.  Museums and collections in Stirling  It was said that ‚ÄòSmith‚Äôs munificence inaugurated what might be called a new era in the annals of the town of Stirling‚Äô. Certainly, the desire to have such a facility in the burgh was long standing. The Stirling School of Arts which was part library, part mechanics institute was formed in 1825 with the intention of building such an establishment. It started out with a small lending library in a rented room in Broad Street in November 1825. Throughout its life, it attracted lecturers of national note. Its annual soirees were demonstrations of intent. In 1854 for example, the need for ‚Äòa lecture room, library and museum, and a public place where interesting specimens of art may be deposited‚Äô was again reiterated and Sir Archibald Alison declared that ‚ÄòStirling will take its place in literature, science and art, which it has long in Scottish history taken in arms‚Äô. The 1854 Soiree showed the potential of a permanent gallery and museum. The Corn Exchange was hired for the purpose, and the walls hung with tartans and evergreens supplied by the Drummonds. There was also a plough and sheaf of wheat from the Drummond Agricultural Museum. It is evident that the different branches of the Drummond family had given considerable assistance. They were tartan retailers, seedsmen, evangelical and temperance publishers and the owners of the Agricultural Museum (established 1831) to show the latest innovations in agriculture. Along one wall, prints and casts were shown, and there was an arrangement of Grecian statuary in front of the platform. Model steam and water engines were displayed, along with the chair of the Reverend James Guthrie, who had been martyred for his beliefs in 1661. This chair became part of the Macfarlane Museum collection, and is now in the Stirling Smith. Another view of the Cairn Garden, Stirling Art Gallery There were various private collections of antiquities in Stirling in the nineteenth century. In the Douglas Room in Stirling Castle was an assortment of arms and armour, including the pikes and other weapons taken from the radical weavers of 1820, and the pulpit of John Knox. The collection of Dr. Alexander Paterson (1822‚Äì1897), ‚Äòlong one of the chief attractions of Bridge of Allan‚Äô had the skull of Darnley, a piece of Sir William Wallace's fetters, a fragment of Robert the Bruce's coffin and the key of Loch Leven Castle. The collection was sold in January 1899 and items from it were given to the Smith over the years. The Macfarlane Museum was assembled by John Macfarlane of Coneyhill, Bridge of Allan (1785‚Äì1868) whose wealth was derived from textile manufacture in Manchester. He was the great local champion of the principle of the free library in Stirling where he opened a library and reading room in 1854. In 1881 the Macfarlane Free Library was transferred to the Smith along with the Macfarlane Museum which contained many important local objects and the Smith curator was charged with the additional task of looking after it. The Museum Hall, Bridge of Allan was built by the Macfarlane Trustees in 1887 as a Concert Hall. The marble bust of John MacFarlane was acquired for the Smith collection in 2002. When the Smith site was selected, it was not in an advantageous part of the burgh. 1400 people signed a petition pointing this out. The building was the second to be built on the north side of the Dumbarton Road, in the King's Park, which was under development as an up- market residential area. The King's Park was cut off from the old town by the medieval wall. It remained unconnected until a new vehicular road was driven through at the Corn Exchange when the Carnegie Library was built in 1904. There was no direct road to the Smith. The pathway from the High School of Stirling (now the Stirling Highland Hotel) was created as a main access route to the Smith only after the Institute was opened to the public. The issue of breaching the medieval wall was one which was traditionally opposed by the people of Stirling. Today, these issues would be resolved by public consultation. The autocratic way in which the site was selected and the extinction of the hope for a museum facility in the old town was deeply resented, as shown by the obituary notice in the Stirling Observer which recounted the story of the Stirling School of Art: ‚ÄòDied at Stirling, on the 8th ult. of sheer neglect, after a lingering illness borne with the utmost indifference on the part of its professed friends, the Stirling School of Art in the 50th year of its age‚Ä¶So hopeless did the condition of the association become that the Directors mercifully cut its sufferings short by shooting it, as they would have done an old horse that had served its day.‚Äô The obituary writer went on to note that: ‚Äòthat centre of intellectual darkness known as Denny, and Airth, Callander, Menstrie and St Ninians all had lectures. The Regime of the Provost of Stirling was like that of Napoleon who made Paris beautiful with boulevards, but did nothing for moral and intellectual welfare of his people. We do not forget the Smith Institute. It is a great boon to the town, and is calculated to be a powerful promoter of that ‚Äòsweetness and light‚Äô which we so much need. But it is the gift of a private individual, and neither the Council nor the Community are entitled to take any credit for it. What have we done for the working classes? As a community, nothing, absolutely nothing. As regards the Smith; its distance from the centre of the town must prevent it from ever becoming a popular resort. It is all very well to say that if a man wants knowledge he will not grudge to walk a mile or two for it. That is true. But what is required is not so much to supply those with knowledge who desire it, as to place it in an inviting form at the very doors of those who have no wish for it, in order that, if possible, such a wish may be begotten.‚Äô  The Smith Building  If the building was geographically disadvantaged, the lack of a living patron added to the problem. Thomas Stuart Smith had intended to supervise the construction personally. Many corners were cut in the construction, and it is evident from the idiosyncratic structure of the roof that the architect, John Lessels (1808‚Äì1883) of Edinburgh, had little direct input. Most of the building material came from the Raploch Quarry on the northern side of the Castle escarpment, now the site of the Fire Station. Additional sandstone came from a quarry at Dunmore. The frontage to Dumbarton Road has a tetra style (four pillared) Doric portico. The tympanum carries two relief carvings of the Stirling seal, the wolf on the left side and the Castle on the right. In the centre is a coat of arms purporting to be that of Thomas Stuart Smith, but the heraldic arrangement is unknown and has never been entered at the Court of the Lord Lyon. The inscription on the entablature below reads The Smith Institute, erected and endowed with funds bequeathed by Thomas Stuart Smith of Glassingall Perthshire. There are six steps to the front door. The wrought metal handrail by Phil Johnston of Ratho Byres Forge was added in 2000. At either side of the steps are two plinths for sculpture (at present with urns) and there is an empty sculpture niche on the right side of the building. A view to the side of Stirling Art Gallery The frontage to Victoria Road and the Back Walk is in length and is broken by two gables having three-light Venetian windows which are surmounted by pediments. The pediments are inscribed with bronze lettering as follows: Erected 1873. Trustees George Christie, Provost of Stirling, J. W. Barty Dunblane, A. W. Cox Nottingham and John Lessels Edinburgh Architect. The west side of the building has a blank wall with no windows, this being the architectural interpretation of the Trust Deed of having ‚Äòspace on either side for contingent additions‚Äô. The back or north wall has three access doors added in 1985-7 during the refurbishment of the building. The Smith had residential accommodation for the curator, and this was occupied by a succession of staff until 1959. When the building was requisitioned by the army in 1914, the curator and his family remained in residence. A separate entrance to the curator's house was created by the army through enlarging a window. This is now the staff entrance, and the former domestic premises are now offices. There were five public areas to the Smith in 1874. On the left of the entrance was the Reading Room and Library. This was a substantial room measuring 50 by , with an elaborate plasterwork scheme on the ceiling. The ceiling had three sections, each with 15 panels containing casts of the Stirling Heads, alternated with casts of the Arms of Stirling, the monogram of Thomas Stuart Smith and the date of the building. The woodwork was stained to look like oak, whilst the groundwork of each panel was in turquoise blue, the whole being enclosed in bands of soft red. The Library walls were in ‚Äòdrab Etruscan‚Äô to harmonise with the ceiling. When the Library moved to the new Carnegie building at the Corn Exchange in 1904, this became the natural history room. The plaster ceiling (by John Craigie of Stirling who had the contract for all the Smith plasterwork) was lost in the dry rot outbreak and removed in 1974. This room, renamed the Ballengeich Room or Gallery 1 was the first area of the Smith to be refurbished (1977). The room is at present used for temporary exhibitions and the Smith Caf√©. To the right of the entrance was the Small Museum, used for displaying the collection of original Stirling Heads and other Scottish antiquities. It was later used for ethnographical displays, and in 1984 was fitted out as the Lecture Room. It is used extensively by community groups and the large stained glass window from Springbank House was resited here in 2000, together with other stained glass panels and the original plasters by Albert Hemstock Hodge (1876‚Äì1918) for the Stirling Burns Monument. The centre gallery, Gallery 2, was conceived as the watercolour gallery, and was top lit. It is now used for temporary exhibitions. The large gallery, Gallery 3 was the gallery for the oil paintings of the foundation collection and remained so until 1970. It was also top lit. At present, it houses the Stirling Story exhibition. In 1874 both of these galleries were painted dark marone with the coves in green. The final area was the General Museum. On the east side of the building with its face to Stirling, it was lit by eight large windows and housed the museum collection. After the difficulties with the building encountered in the 1970s, this area became the storage area, and is no longer accessible to the public. When the Smith first opened to the public, almost equal amounts space were devoted to the gallery and museum. There was no provision for workshop or storage space and the anticipated expansion on the site did not happen. The pressing need for storage and workshop space has resulted in the loss of a third of the public area for that purpose and most of the fine art collection is at present confined to storage. The pressure for temporary exhibition space keeps Galleries 1 and 2 filled with constantly changing exhibitions, mainly by contemporary artists. The occupation of the Gallery 3, the largest exhibition space, with museum display is a temporary measure until new storage can be found and the splendour of this huge picture gallery restored to its original purpose. The work of building the Smith was undertaken mainly by local contractors with a couple of exceptions. Sinclair of Edinburgh had the contract for the mason work, and the decoration was undertaken by Bonnar and Carfrae, also of Edinburgh, and one of the foremost in their field. The Bonnar family, tracing their lineage from John Bonnar who became a master painter in 1756, have had many talented artists in the family. One of them, John A. T. Bonnar, worked on the Smith contract and was resident in Stirling. A box painted with an intricate decorative scheme which belonged to him, but possibly executed by his older relative William Bonnar RSA (1800‚Äì1853) was presented to the Smith by his descendant, film-maker David Bonnar Thomson. The Smith was a constant source of inspiration for the young David sent by his art teacher, James Atterson, from the High School of Stirling down the Back Walk to study the paintings. The box represents one of several unbroken artistic threads which link the Smith to a family of artists through generations over a 130-year span.  The early years  The first Smith curator was Alexander Croall (1804‚Äì1885), a native of Angus who acquired a national reputation as a natural historian, and who was also the first curator of Derby City Museum before his appointment to Stirling.Alexander Croall, Samuel Smiles, Men of Invention and Industry, accessed March 2011 As a young man he had trained himself in botany through his frequent field trips. ‚ÄòOn those occasions he commonly slept on the heather, carrying his slender commissariat in his pocket‚Äô. He corresponded with and was respected by other eminent natural historians, including Balfour, Dickie, Hooker and Darwin. In 1855, Sir William Hooker commissioned Croall to prepare a herbarium of the plants of Braemar for Queen Victoria. Croall is still remembered for his standard four volume work, British Sea Weeds: Nature Printed published in 1860 and illustrated by W. G. Johnston. Such was his passion for sea weed that he had the nickname ‚ÄòRoosty Tangle.‚Äô Croall had the talent for inspiring others. He had much influence on a young boy, David Buchan Morris (1867‚Äì1943) who grew up to be Town Clerk of Stirling and was deeply involved in running the Smith in the period 1901-1939. Morris wrote of Croall that: 'Never was there a happier appointment, and never was a man more happy in his situation. The Trustees... placed unbounded confidence in him... People from all parts consulted him on many subjects ‚Äì objects rather ‚Äì of natural science and archaeology and he met them in such a genial spirit that he seemed really to thank them for giving him the trouble.' Mr Croall set a very high ideal of this place and work in his new sphere of life. He looked upon the Smith Institute as the shrine of art and science in Stirling, and himself as their high priest. Working with Stirling High School art master Leonard Baker, Croall mounted an exhibition of contemporary art in 1878. Out of this grew the Stirling Fine Art Association. Croall also established the Stirling Field Club whose members helped build up the collections of the Smith Institute. In the early years the Field Club met in the Smith, and the successes of the museum are recorded in the printed transactions of the society 1878-1938. He was eloquent and inspirational. His paper Weeds ‚Äì what they are, and what to do with them (November 1883) is a lyrical lecture on the biodiversity of Creation, and typical of his teaching. His daughter Annie Croall (1854‚Äì1927) also made a significant contribution in Stirling. After finding a baby abandoned on the Back Walk, she opened a house for homeless women and then the Stirling Children's Home. Her story is recounted in Fifty Years on a Scottish Battlefield 1873-1923. When Alexander Croall died, the Trustees appointed his son-in-law James Sword, who had been working in the County Council Office, as curator. During Sword's curatorship (1885‚Äì1921), the specialist history and antiquities collections were built up through small but significant purchases and donations. Sword was a keen natural historian and sportsman and with skills in taxidermy. It was he who created the large collection of stuffed birds and animals, and put together the collection of communion tokens. He also did much to improve the grounds, making pavements, concrete kerbings and bases for the iron railings.  Stirling Fine Art Association exhibitions  A regular feature of the Smith's programme between 1881 and 1938 was the three yearly Stirling Fine Art Association Exhibition. There were eighteen of these exhibitions in all, usually running from January to March. Season and family tickets could be purchased. Many of the best known names in the Scottish art world exhibited at the Smith, including Cadell, McTaggart, Bessie MacNicol, Robert Gemmell Hutchison and Anne Redpath. The local artistic community included William Kennedy, Joseph Denovan Adam, Nellie Harvey, D. Y. Cameron, Henry and Isobel Morley, and stained glass designer Isobel Goudie. In 1910, Stirling architects Crawford and Fraser exhibited their drawings for Henry Morley's new house \\"The Gables\\" which was \\"the speak o'the toun\\". Other architectural plans and cartoons for stained glass windows were exhibited from time to time. The triennial exhibitions were accompanied by a lecture and concert programme. The speakers and musicians were accommodated on a platform at the back of the large gallery. It was at these concerts that the work of the young Muir Mathieson was premiered. Son of artist John G. Mathieson who ran a gallery at 16 Allan Park, he went on to become famous as a composer for the British film industry. Many of the concerts in the 1930s were organised by Adam R. Lennox, musical director of the Stirling Operatic Society and organist of Chalmers‚Äô Church. He worked in the Town Clerk's Office for David B. Morris. Alexander McIntosh OBE, at that time a young assistant in the Town Clerk's Office sometimes had the duty to show people to their seats at the Smith concerts. The Constitution of the Stirling Fine Art Association allowed the purchase of works of art to be added to the Smith collections from any surplus funds, after all expenses incurred by the exhibition had been defrayed. Unfortunately, these circumstances rarely occurred.  Two World Wars  The work of the Smith came to an abrupt halt in 1914 with the outbreak of war and the requisitioning of the building for military purposes. This happened twice in the twentieth century. From 1914 to 1921 and 1939 to 1948 the Smith was rendered inoperable as a gallery and museum, being used for the billeting of troops and other military purposes. Stirling was a garrison town from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries, and the billeting of troops in times of crisis was one of the domestic hazards of life in the burgh for most people. The Smith suffered badly from the experience of the two wars. The damage list of 1919 makes for particularly dismal reading ‚Äì damaged front steps, broken and bent railings; choked valley gutters leading to dampness, water ingress and damage to the collections stacked high in the side rooms; broken windows, plaster, flooring, lamps, ventilation grating; eleven sheets of roof glass broken; flooring stained with oil and urine; doors and door furniture removed; damage to the boiler. An entrance with rough wooden steps for the curator and his family had been created on the east side of the building. Worse still, the public were banned from coming near the building: ‚ÄúLoitering of any kind on any portion of the Institute grounds to be rigorously prevented by the Military Authorities. No person other than troops to be permitted with the grounds‚Ä¶‚Äù To have this rough treatment for lengthy periods twice within twenty-five years was an experience from which the Smith scarcely recovered. The paintings had to be crammed into the museum spaces to leave the two large galleries free for troop accommodation. There were no washing facilities, even for the eating utensils of the troops. Food was served through hatches burst in the west wall, from a field kitchen erected in the grounds. The wrought iron railings were removed from the front of the building to aid the war effort in the 1940s. The Smith's third curator, Joseph McNaughton served from 1921 to the derequisitioning of the Smith in 1947. With the aid of his nephew Duncan, he managed to publish a catalogue of the collections in 1934.  Artillery  Gallery Three in particular was used during both wars to billet troops especially when they were training on the King's Park. It must have been the practice to clean weapons and ammunition while there as live rounds of Lee‚ÄìEnfield and 707 bullets had been found over the years. When Gallery 3 was about to be reconditioned the central heating duct in the middle of the room had to be carefully searched to remove any remaining ammunition. The workmen reported having found some more ammunition as a result of this search and subsequent works.  The Stirling Smith 1951-1957 - An Account by Margaret Allan  After retiring from the police force in 1950/51, my grandfather, Robert Moffat became caretaker of the Smith Institute. He stayed with granny in the adjoining house. My brother, sister and myself stayed every weekend and all school holidays. Each day was an adventure with the history and stories that papa told us. His office was on the right hand side as you walked in the entrance. I remember the shelves being packed with books, ledgers and files. He sat at the huge desk in front of the window where he would write with a quill. Although I tried, I never managed to master it and was left with blobs of ink on the paper. Going through the glass doors was like entering another world, full of history and wonder. In the room on the left, there were lots of glass cases which had birds eggs, large and small. Also butterflies of outstanding colours, down to plain creamy ones, and moths, some of them so large, it gave you the shudders. As you entered the room on the right, you stopped dead in your tracks, because, there in front of you was a stuffed wild cat which looked alive and ready to pounce on you. The stuffed birds of prey looked every bit as alive as the wild cat, especially one of the eagles. I used to duck as I ran past it. In the glass cases against the wall, there were snakes in liquid in tall glass jars, also creepy crawlies. Not my favourite part of the museum, as it gave me nightmares. There were steps which led into another part of the room. There was a stone age display of bowls, round grinders with a hole in the middle to put a stick so you could turn it to grind corn, etc. What was so interesting was that man had made these, and the tools that were needed for cooking. At the very top of this room were all the ancient coins and paper money which was not so old. You could get into the main gallery from this room, but I preferred to walk back to the passage and enter through two glass doors into a small room before going into the gallery because all the armour was here. Shields and swords were put up on the walls and chain gauntlets. When the film Rob Roy was on at the Allan Park Picture house, papa was given permission to supply the shields and swords for display at the entrance in the picture house. He was given free tickets for the film which we all enjoyed and also added to the history in the museum for us. In the main gallery, marble busts of famous people stood proudly around the edge of the floor. Paintings were hung on the walls, some nice but some, to me anyway were not so nice, but, it was history, and the scenes were real. At the back of the gallery was a stage where many concerts were held. There was a private door leading from the house into the passage in the museum, and I used to love peeping out to watch the people who were dressed so smartly. I remember some of the ladies wearing long dresses and fur stoles, like my granny used to wear. Sadly I can‚Äôt remember the concerts. The house itself was an adventure of sorts as a ghost used to walk about upstairs. There were four bedrooms, and at the top of the stairs was a room which had windows and curtains and had lots of trunks and boxes on the floor. Downstairs was a dining room. At Christmas, papa got a tree that reached the ceiling. It was covered in glitter and fancy balls. The logs in the fire crackled cheerily adding to the excitement. The bathroom was long and narrow, but the kitchen was big, and always smelled of baking and jam making. The two parrots, Polly the Amazon green, and Sunshine the African grey, sat in their cages on top of the dresser. Both had a wonderful vocabulary and seemed to have the knack of saying the right thing at the right time. In the cupboard next to the gas cooker was a peep hole where I could look into the stone age part of the museum. Going down the stairs at the side door, and turning left, was the boiler room. My initials are in the cement there. Papa loved his garden. The rose garden was in the front. At the side of the museum were trees and daffodils. Occasionally Mr Mclarin brought his horse over to graze in the side. Further up, and going through the gates was a garden the width of the grounds. Strawberries, gooseberries, rasps, rhubarb, red and blackcurrants, then there was potatoes, onions, carrots, peas, mint. Then the flowers, peony roses, poppies, marigolds and lots of others. Going out the gate and turning right was the orchard. There were plum trees, apple and crab apple trees. One day as I was walking, I noticed that one of the gratings was loose on the side of the wall. I decided to see where it led, and crawled in. Well I didn‚Äôt get too far along the tunnel when I got stuck. My brother was too frightened to come in so he got papa, who came with a pulley rope and made a loop at the end. He kept throwing it until it slipped over my feet. Slowly he tugged, and pulled me out. My hips and legs were all scraped, but that didn‚Äôt stop me from getting spanked for going in in the first place. On my thirteenth birthday, papa gave me a gold signet ring. After my birthday tea, I went out to the orchard. I was so thrilled at getting a gold ring, that I flung out my arms and birled round. Suddenly, as I was spinning round, my ring flew off my finger. I hunted and hunted until papa came to see if I was okay. Tears streaming down my face, I told him what had happened. I was heartbroken, but papa said that that would teach me to think before I did anything every again. When papa died in 1957, three years later, I walked around his treasured gardens and the orchard. I looked again on the chance that I might just find my ring, papa‚Äôs gift to me, but it remained hidden.  Memories of the Smith 1956-1968 - An Account by Ruth M Millican  I lived opposite the Smith (or the Smith Institute as it was then known) from 1956 until 1968. My father was the Baptist minister and until 1968 the manse was at 23 Albert Place. During these years, we did visit the museum often, but my more vivid memories are of the grounds and the house attached to the museum. As children, the grounds of the museum were our playground. The long grass and the leafy trees were places of adventure, especially during the summer holidays. We ran around playing imaginative games, climbing trees and playing football until we were called in to go to bed. At other times of the year we enjoyed bonfires and fireworks in the grounds. Often we played with the grandson of the caretakers, Bob and Bessie McLeish. They lived in the house attached to the museum and I remember going from the house, through a large door, into the museum office which was full of papers. The curator came from Glasgow every day by bus, getting off the bus just outside the museum. Bob McLeish had served in the Royal Artillery in the First World War. After retiring from the REME workshops, he felt he needed some occupation, so became caretaker of the Smith. When he arrived, the grounds had become neglected so he spent a great deal of time restoring them. He kept the garden beautifully and was able to provide year-round flowers and greenery for the Baptist Church where he and Bessie were members. Many residents of the surrounding area admired his garden and thanked him for keeping it so beautifully. When not gardening, he was often seen riding a large, elderly bicycle at speed down Albert Place. The brakes on the bicycle were somewhat inadequate, so he had to jump off when he wanted to stop! During the years we lived in Albert Place, the museum appeared to be rather neglected. The galleries seemed quite bare, but my brother and I have memories of a butterfly collection in the first room on the left. In a room on the right there were stuffed animals: particularly memorable were a wild cat and a bird of prey. At the back of the building, there was a very large room which had an enormous painting on the back wall as well as some portraits on the other walls. Occasionally there were special exhibitions; certainly there was a local art exhibition from time to time and one of our neighbours used to regularly contribute paintings to these exhibitions. Very rarely, there would be a concert to attend. The Smith Institute and its grounds were an important part of my childhood. I am delighted that the Smith has been kept open and is now flourishing.  The Stirling Smith 1959-1990  Many museums in Scotland, like the Smith, were founded by a private individual or an archaeological or scientific society, and were run with private resources for public benefit. Libraries developed in the same way. With encouragement from Andrew Carnegie, public libraries became the mark of a civilised society, and the Public Libraries Act made their funding by the local authority mandatory. Gradually, many local authorities also took on the responsibility of running their local museums, but this remained an option rather than a duty. Various letters from concerned experts were addressed to the Smith Trustees during the difficult years, urging them to hand over the Smith to the burgh council. During the years of the Great Depression, the money left by Thomas Stuart Smith failed to return much by way of interest. The building began to develop problems, made worse by the Second World War. By the 1960s, the underfunding and lack of development was serious, and the enduring memory that many Stirling citizens have of the building in this period is the sound of rain being caught in numerous metal buckets and tin cans, spread around the floor at strategic points. In 1970, the Trustees, on the advice of the Keeper of the National Museum of Antiquities, signed over the original Stirling Heads to the Department of Ancient Monuments (now Historic Scotland). It was feared that these important early portraits were in danger because of the condition of the Smith and that they should be returned to their original home, Stirling Castle. (The National Museum trustees have not elected to return the three Stirling heads in their collection to Stirling Castle.) Additional proposals sought from other experts recommended the dispersal of the art collection, and the use of the history collections for exhibitions in various historic buildings in the upper town. At one point, the building was in such poor condition that the only viable option seemed to be demolition. In 1973, the Friends of the Smith, a body of concerned citizens was formed to save the building and its collections. Working in partnership with the local authority, they effected a rescue package. Elsewhere in Scotland, museums and galleries were the responsibility of the district councils. In Stirling, the situation with the Smith was so serious, that the regional council was persuaded to enter into the partnership, providing half of the public funding package. The Joint Committee of Stirling District Council and Central Regional Council was the Smith's governing body from 1975 until the disappearance of the Regional Council in 1996, and during those years, it alone of all the Regional Councils in Scotland invested money in a local museum and gallery. A major programme of refurbishment was undertaken in the mid 1980s, and the collections were moved out to various stores during the contract period. Some of the cost-cutting measures undertaken by the original builders came to light. In 1984 during renovation of Gallery 2, an initially straight forward contract became suddenly much more expensive and difficult. We were called through to the room by the contractors to look at a problem they had encountered with the dividing wall between galleries 2 and 3. I had to climb up to look at the top of the wall which appeared sound but that was not the problem. One of the builders leaned gently on the top of the wall and we all had the distinct feeling that the scaffolding was swaying dramatically. It was not the scaffold but the wall that had moved about a foot at the top. Since this wall was supposed to be holding up the roof at this point it was rather worrying. It turned out that the Victorian builders had built a wall only two bricks wide but forty feet high. Thankfully the main roof beams were able to support the roof and had in fact been holding the wall in place for one hundred and ten years. The entire wall had to be demolished and a new wall six bricks wide with a five-foot foundation, rebuilt in its place.  Fifty Gallon Drum - An Account by Michael McGinnes  When the museum collections were in storage in the old High School (now the Highland Hotel) we made use of five rooms on the main wing, three on the ground floor and two above. The third room on the second floor was not used for anything important as it had a tendency to flood in heavy rain. The water came in at one point and, had to be collected, otherwise it could have flooded the room below which did contain museum objects. We did this with a fifty gallon oil drum and during wet weather it was part of the routine to check if the drum was filling. When it was sufficiently full (not too heavy) it was dragged over to the door that connected to the spiral staircase below the observatory and tipped down the stair. There was no other way to remove the water. Luckily these stairs went all the way to ground level and out onto Spittal Street. It must have been a strange sight to see a rush of water out of the bottom door but no-one ever mentioned it.  The Friends of the Smith  To give an account of how the Friends of the Smith worked to ensure a future for the Smith would take a book in itself. David Brown, who was a member of the Executive Committee of the Friends, 1986‚Äì1996, and twice Chairman in that period, gives a flavour of what the work involved.  The Smith & I by David Brown  Hans Meidner was Chairman when I joined the Friends. His portrait painted as a demonstration piece by James Fullerton in 1¬Ω hours is now part of the Smith collection. The brochure of 1981 produced by Hans Meidner refers to the anonymous donor of ¬£12,000, which made possible the opening of the Ballengeich Room in 1977, who is now known to be Mrs F. W. Saunders, later President of the Friends; when she made that generous gesture which surely saved the Smith from ignominious extinction, she was Miss Mary Service, Honorary Secretary. Hans was succeeded by Noel Connal in 1984 and until he left Stirling in 1996 he was the backbone of the committee which deferred to him in all matters, particularly as he and Mrs Saunders were our representatives on the Joint Committee. Noel‚Äôs untimely death in February 1986 saw his vice, Alex Ross take over; he it was who persuaded me to become Honorary Treasurer. During the Chairmanship of Angus Davidson, whose sterling service is commemorated by the Rowan tree at the entrance to the car park, the next memorable event ‚Äì apart from Plant Sale, Jazz concerts, Children‚Äôs Art Competitions, Operation Skylark, etc., etc. ‚Äì was the massive effort made by Matilda Mitchell in raising over ¬£25,000 to restore works held by the Smith. The first of these was ‚ÄòThe Pipe of Freedom‚Äô by T. S. Smith which features in the Friends brochure of 1991 produced during my time in the dual role of Chairman/Treasurer following Susan Ward‚Äôs two years in office. The highlight of Susan‚Äôs chairmanship was the raising of ¬£8220 in five weeks to ensure the purchase of Sir Joshua Reynolds‚Äô portrait of Mrs Callander; the Friends actually provided more than one quarter of the purchase price of ¬£40,000. Maureen Anderson relieved me of the Treasurer‚Äôs duties in 1992 and Catriona Brown was appointed chairman in March 1993. During 1993 and 1994 I was happy to work for the good of the Smith as an ordinary member of the Friends committee; my main contribution was as convenor of the Plant Sale sub- committee. In 1995 the most memorable event was the Margaret Marshall concert on 1 October and it was during the Children‚Äôs Art Competition in December that I found myself once more in the chair. In 1996 the Plant Sale was again one of my main concerns, and during July, August and September, the Denovan Adam Exhibition‚Äôs success was supplemented by the presence of Highland cows and rare breeds of sheep and goats in what is now Ailie‚Äôs Garden. I got much pleasure from assisting with the care of the animals ‚Äì ‚Äúmucking out‚Äù, feeding and grooming, particularly Hamish, officially appointed PRO of the Smith, and teaching the goats to dance during evening feed time. Hamish‚Äôs Farewell Party with the Central Region Schools‚Äô Pipe Band was on Sunday 15 September when Sion Barrington transferred him to the Farm Life Centre at Dunaverig. After the successful concert ‚ÄúFrom Vienna to Moscow‚Äù given by Anne McLennan-Scott and the Morley String Quartet (all members of Scottish Opera) on Sunday 22 September, I once again resigned as chairman, but when Hamish returned in September 1997 I was his full-time carer; the grass was waist-high and he couldn‚Äôt eat it, nor could I find his droppings! So with a borrowed scythe I set to, to create a usable paddock and a reserve of fresh straw for his comfort and consumption.  The Stirling Smith 1996-2005  From 1996 to 1999, John Scott was Chair of the Friends. During this time, the Smith won one of the first Woodmansterne Awards for the conservation of the Hugh Howard portrait of composer Arcangelo Corelli (1653‚Äì1713). Paul Woodmansterne was so delighted with the project that he brought an early music ensemble from St. Albans to perform Corelli's Christmas Concerto and other works in a celebratory concert in the big gallery. John Scott was also personally involved as part of the team constructing the William Wallace exhibition of 1997, the Victorian Stirling exhibition in 1998, and the Stirling Story exhibition in 2000. Each of these was a major production showing different aspects of the Smith's collections. Margaret Gray's time as Chairperson was distinguished with the production and delivery of Ailie's Garden, the biodiversity and play area at the rear of the Smith in 2002. A membership drive, assisted with the first colour-printed Friends leaflet, took the membership to over 900, a significant achievement for a small museum. Moira Lawson who became Chair in 2004 was heavily involved in the fund raising and project management for Ailie's Garden, as well as in the fundraising for the purchase of the Wallace painting. Her culinary skills are important in providing the special social events which punctuate the Smith's year ‚Äì the exhibition openings, celebrations and children's events.

Her first band was Plastic Soul (firstly called \\"Jive with Clive\\"), with Josefsson, Johan Duncanson (guitar), Fredrick Whitling (lead-guitar and keyboards), Olof Martinsson (bass) and Per Blomgren (drums). Between 1996 and 2000, they took part in club gigs and indie Summer festivals and released some singles, \\"Uneasy\\" and \\"Take a dive\\". Johan and Per began a new successful project, The Radio Dept. Josefsson also took part in two non-long-lasting projects. In 1999, she played and recorded two promo E.P.'s with Magnus Tingsek and their band ewing.1. Between 2000 and 2001, she was the lead singer of Dan Bornemark's rock band, The Good Mornings, recording an album (The Good Mornings, 2000). In the fall of 2001, during a holiday trip to the Greek island of Crete, Josefsson and her boyfriend Martinique Josefsson started the band Sandy Mouche with their friends, the Blomgren brothers, Per (drums) and Ola (guitar) and Danyal Taylan (bass until 2004). They toured Japan, France and Poland, and went onto release three albums, White Lucky Dragon (2004), ... and poems for the unborn (2006) and Glory and grace (2013). The song, \\"Spiderweb suit\\", written by Josefsson, features in the film New York Waiting (directed by Joachim Hed√©n, 2006). Sandy Mouche played together in a gig in Malm√∂ in 2010. Backing vocals 150px Josefsson started as a backing vocalist for The Ark, singing on their We Are the Ark (2000) and In Lust We Trust (2002) albums. In early 2003, Josefsson started collaborating with Per Gessle as a backing singer for his successful solo album Mazarin, which topped the charts in Sweden. Christoffer Lundquist, Gessle's producer was looking for a female singer and picked Josefsson. She first came to the attention of Lundquist after she and Sandy Mouche wanted to record at his Aerosol Grey Machine (AGM) studio. \\"I remember driving a car between Lund and Lomma when Christoffer called and wondered if I was interested in starting singing with Per who wanted a girl for his solo projects.\\", recalled Josefsson. She went on the Mazarin Sommarturne (Summer tour) in 2003 with Gessle and his solo band: Clarence √ñfwerman (keyboards), Christoffer Lundquist (bass), Jonas Isaakson (guitar), Jens Jansson (drums). She then was involved with Gessle's band Gyllene Tider for their album Finn 5 fel! (2004) and then sung in Swedish and English for Gessle's solo albums, Son of a Plumber (2005), En h√§ndig man (2007) and Party Crasher (2008). Her voice became more prominent in Party Crasher, significantly contributing to the songs, \\"Hey, I Died and Went to Heaven\\" and \\"Perfect Excuse\\". She toured Sweden again with Gessle for the En h√§ndig man Sommarturne (2007), and around Europe for The Party Crasher Tour (2009), and then went on a world tour with Roxette in 2011. She has also featured in a number of songs for Swedish-Iranian singer Arash Labaf. The video for their 2010 collaboration, \\"Broken Angel\\", has over 200 million views on YouTube.These are official videos that have been uploaded by the record labels. Their more recent releases include \\"Dooset Daram\\" (2018) and \\"One Night in Dubai\\" (2019). Josefsson has also done backing vocals for other artists including, Righteous Boy, Swan Lee, Junior Senior, Andreas Johnson, Sebastian Karlsson, and Pelle Ossler. Solo albums and other projects In 2007 Josefsson released her first solo album, Dynamo. The album was produced by Lundquist at his AGM studio and was published by EMI and Gessle's own company, Elevator Entertainment. The album spent two weeks on the Swedish Charts reaching No. 23 as the highest position. Josefsson toured with her own band in 2007 to promote Dynamo in Sweden and Germany. Her second album, Kyss Mej (Kiss me), followed in 2011. It was her first in Swedish but it received mixed reviews from the press. In the same year, she took part in a tribute project to the American country music singer Dolly Parton. Josefsson along with other Swedish female singers, Nina Persson (the Cardigans), Cecilia Nordlund (aka Cilihili), Lotta Wengl√©n and Gudr√∫n Hauksd√≥ttir, performed a live concert and recorded a documentary film Jag √§r min egen Dolly Parton (I am My Own Dolly Parton, dir. Jessica Nettelbladt). An English version of the documentary was also released. In 2013 Josefsson sang together with the Vindla String Quartet, performing in French, notably \\"Hymne √† l'amour\\" by Edith Piaf. and \\"Ne Me Quitte Pas\\" by Jacques Brel. \\"Ne Me Quitte Pas\\" was filmed by Sveriges Berlin, a Malm√∂ based video magazine that followed local culture. In late 2015 she released Happiness, a jazz-covers album with Swedish trio Kontur, and toured Sweden with them. Peter Eliasson of Sk√•nska Dagbladet reviewed the tour premiere in Malm√∂, scoring the concert 3 out of 5. She released Beauty love anything in 2019. Personal life Josefsson married Martinique Josefsson, her longtime boyfriend, in 2003; they live in Malm√∂ and became the parents of a boy, Charles Diedrick, on November 8, 2008. On May 31, 2012 her second child, a boy named Cornelis was born. In 2012 Helena graduated from the University of Copenhagen with an optometrist diploma. In between touring and recording sessions she works in one of the optic stores in Landskrona (near Malm√∂, south Sweden).

Zadoc Kahn (18 February 1839 in Mommenheim, Alsace - 8 December 1905 in Paris) was an Alsatian-French rabbi and chief rabbi of France.  Life  In 1856 he entered the rabbinical school of Metz, finishing his theological studies at the same institution after it had been established at Paris as the S√©minaire Isra√©lite; and on graduation he was appointed director of the Talmud Torah, the preparatory school of the seminary. In 1867 he was appointed assistant to Chief Rabbi Lazare Isidor of Paris, whom he succeeded in the following year, when Isidor became chief rabbi of France. As Kahn had not yet reached the prescribed age of 30, he had to obtain a dispensation before he could accept the office, his election to which had been largely due to his thesis L'Esclavage Selon la Bible et le Talmud (1867; later translated into German and Hebrew). The community of Paris attained to a high degree of prosperity and enlightenment under Kahn's administration. On Chief Rabbi Isidor's death in 1889 Kahn was unanimously elected chief rabbi of France, and was inducted on 25 March 1890. He then entered upon a period of many-sided philanthropic activity. He organized the relief movement in behalf of the Jews expelled from Russia, and gave much of his time to the work of the Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle, which elected him honorary president in recognition of his services. He aided in establishing many private charitable institutions, including the Refuge du Plessis-Piquet, near Paris, an agricultural school for abandoned children, and the Maison de Retraite at Neuilly-sur-Seine, for young girls. He was appointed Chevalier of the Legion of Honor in 1879 and Officer in 1901. He was also Officer of Public Instruction. Zadoc Kahn was one of the founders, the first vice-president, and, soon after, president, of the Soci√©t√© des √âtudes Juives (1879). He was considered a brilliant orator, and one of his most noteworthy addresses was delivered on the centenary (11 May 1889) of the French Revolution ‚Äî \\"La R√©volution Fran√ßaise et le Juda√Øsme\\".

Thus the distribution decreases exponentially, which is more slowly than the normal distribution. It is therefore suitable to model phenomena where numerically large values are more probable than is the case for the normal distribution. Examples are returns from financial assets and turbulent wind speeds. The hyperbolic distributions form a subclass of the generalised hyperbolic distributions. The origin of the distribution is the observation by Ralph Alger Bagnold, published in his book The Physics of Blown Sand and Desert Dunes (1941), that the logarithm of the histogram of the empirical size distribution of sand deposits tends to form a hyperbola. This observation was formalised mathematically by Ole Barndorff-Nielsen in a paper in 1977, where he also introduced the generalised hyperbolic distribution, using the fact the a hyperbolic distribution is a random mixture of normal distributions.

It is co-designated as Interstate 81 (I-81), I-83, U.S. Route 11 (US 11), US 322, and Pennsylvania Route 581 (PA 581) at various locations along the route. The beltway is primarily located in the suburbs of Harrisburg; however, part of its southern leg passes along the southern edge of downtown. The southwestern section of the highway is named the Harrisburg Expressway. All of the beltway was complete by 1995; however, it was not designated as the Capital Beltway until 1997. Route description The Capital Beltway begins at the interchange of the eastern terminus of PA 581 at I-83 west of the city of Harrisburg in the borough of Lemoyne. This junction is colloquially known as the \\"York split\\". From the split, the beltway crosses the Susquehanna River on the John Harris Bridge, connecting Harrisburg to its west shore (a colloquialism of the western bank of the Susquehanna across from Harrisburg) suburbs of the city. Continuing on I-83, the beltway parallels Paxton Street (formerly US 322), passing the Harrisburg Mall as the road approaches the Eisenhower Interchange. At the junction, the Capital Beltway continues on I-83 as it turns north, while beginning a concurrency with US 322\\\\. Continuing for three miles (5 km), I-83 ends at I-81 at an interchange locally known as the \\"81/83 split\\". US 322 and the Capital Beltway continue on I-81 south. On I-81, US 322 exits off I-81 at exit 67B, heading in a northerly direction to State College, beginning a concurrency with US 22 west. Exit 67A is for US 22 east, Cameron Street, which is where the Farm Show Arena Complex is located (a half mile south of the beltway). The Capital Beltway crosses the Susquehanna the second time on the George N. Wade Memorial Bridge. The beltway makes a southerly turn just beyond the bridge, near the western end of the Susquehanna Water Gap of Blue Mountain. Continuing on I-81 until exit 59, the Capital Beltway exits onto PA 581, also known as the Harrisburg Expressway. US 11 begins a concurrency with PA 581 starting at exit 3, and then exits off and starts a concurrency with US 15 in the borough of Camp Hill, at the Camp Hill Shopping Center (formerly Camp Hill Mall). The beltway continues for two miles (3 km) until it completes the loop by reaching I-83 at the York split. History PA 581 eastbound approaching the Creekview Road exit in Hampden Township The I-81 and I-83 sections of the beltway were both fully completed by the 1970s. An expressway connecting I-81 to I-83 had been planned, and the portion of the highway from the York split to US 11 and US 15 in Camp Hill was completed in 1992. It became known as the Harrisburg Expressway, and it was given the PA 581 designation. The section from Camp Hill to I-81 remained incomplete until 1995 when construction began on the segment. It was finally completed and opened for public use in 1997. The PA 581 designation was extended northwestward to the interchange with I-81 when it opened. The Capital Beltway designation was assigned to its current alignment at this time. Engineering for the project was provided by Gannett Fleming and McCormick Taylor of Camp Hill. On May 9, 2013, a tanker crashed and caught fire at the interchange between I-81 and US 22/US 322 in Harrisburg. The fire damaged the bridges carrying westbound US 22/US 322 and a ramp over I-81. At least one of those bridges, carrying US 22 eastbound over I-81 and several ramps, and possibly another, the ramp carrying traffic from I-81 northbound to US 22/US 322 westbound, will have to be demolished and replaced. The fire resulted in about ten miles of I-81, from the PA 581 interchange to the I-83 interchange, being closed in both directions, with traffic being diverted along the southern portion of the Capital Beltway.

It forms a species complex with the other three Megaceryle species. Taxonomy The first formal description of the crested kingfisher was by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1834 under the binomial name Alcedo lugubris. The 5 volumes were originally issued in 102 parts, 1820-1839. The current genus Megaceryle was erected by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1848. Megaceryle is from the Ancient Greek megas, \\"great\\", and the existing genus Ceryle. The specific name lugubris is the Latin word for \\"mournful\\". There are four subspecies: * M. l. continentalis (Hartert, 1900) ‚Äì Himalayas, from Afghanistan to Bhutan * M. l. guttulata (Stejneger, 1892) ‚Äì Bhutan to Vietnam, China and North Korea * M. l. pallida (Momiyama, 1927) ‚Äì northern Japan (Hokkaido), southern Kuril Islands * M. l. lugubris (Temminck, 1834) ‚Äì central and southern Japan (Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu) Description The crested kingfisher is a very large black and white kingfisher with a shaggy crest. It has evenly barred wings and tail. It lacks a supercilium and has a spotted breast, which is sometimes mixed with rufous. From Darap village in West Sikkim, India. Range and habitat Crested Kingfisher, Himalayan Range, Uttarakhand, India It is resident in the Himalayas and mountain foothills of northern India, Bangladesh, northern Indochina, Southeast Asia and Japan. This bird is mainly found in mountain rivers and larger rivers in the foothills of mountains. Behaviour=Breeding The nest is a burrow excavated into a vertical bank in a forest. It can be by a stream or a ravine or can be up to away from water. The burrow is dug by both sexes using their feet and bills. It is wide and in length.

It stars Charles Bronson and his wife, Jill Ireland. It was written and directed by Frank D. Gilroy, based on his novel. Plot In the late 19th century American West, a gang of bank robbers, including Graham Dorsey (Charles Bronson), is off to rob a small-town bank, but Graham is having second thoughts: he's had a nightmare in which the gang was wiped out during the robbery attempt. Worse, Graham's horse broke down and the gang members have to get another. They try at the ranch of the widow Amanda Starbuck (Jill Ireland). Amanda, suspicious of the men, denies having a horse. Graham checks out the barn and finds a horse, but still afraid of disaster, he lies to his men and agrees to wait three hours at the ranch for their return. It turns out he has another reason for wanting to stay behind though: he wants to force himself on Mrs. Starbuck. Amanda resists rather inventively; simply lies still, fully clothed. This frustrates Graham, who decides on a ruse. He pretends he is impotent, hoping to play on Amanda's sympathy. The deception works, and they make love three times. As time passes, Graham and Amanda have a long, thoughtful discussion talking of their past lives, as well as their hopes and ambitions - Graham even wants to go straight and work in a bank. They even dance to Amanda's music box, with Graham wearing Mr. Starbuck's old tuxedo. A neighbor boy stops by to tell Amanda about an attempted bank robbery. The bank robbers from Graham's gang were caught and were going to be hanged in town that afternoon. She thinks Graham should ride out and help them. Graham thinks this is a way for him to be able to stay with her and get away from the gang. After much coercing he decides to play along and rides out, intending only to have a long nap. But this is shattered when the posse rides into sight, spotting Graham and giving chase. Graham eludes them when he comes upon a traveling dentist, exchanges clothes with him at gunpoint, and steals his horse and wagon. The unfortunate Dr. Finger is taken for Graham and shot dead. The posse, recognizing Mr. Starbuck's horse and tux, bring the body back to the Starbuck ranch. Amanda, seeing what she thinks is Graham's body faints. But Graham does not get away clean: it turns out Dr. Finger was a quack, and the first person Graham encounters after his escape was one of Dr. Finger's dissatisfied customers. He is put into prison on a year-long sentence for Dr. Finger's crimes. At first Amanda is ostracized by the townspeople. But an impassioned speech proclaiming her true love for him does a remarkable trick: the townspeople not only forgive her, they see a remarkable story in that of Graham and Amanda. This story forms the basis of a legend, one that spawns a popular book, From Noon Till Three, dime novels, a stage play, and even a popular song, \\"Hello and Goodbye,\\" set to the tune of Amanda's music box. The legend of Graham and Amanda becomes bigger than the reality of the two, and with her book a worldwide best seller it makes Amanda a wealthy woman. Graham, who reads the book while in prison, is amused by the distortions: Graham is described as being 6'3\\" (1.90 m), Southern, and very handsome; he is, in fact, none of these. After serving his time he is eager to renew his relationship with Amanda. A disguised Graham takes one of Amanda's guided tours of her ranch, and stays behind, intending to reveal himself. When he does so, Amanda does not recognize him and becomes frightened. It is only when Graham shows her \\"something that's not in the book\\" that Amanda believes him. But instead of joy, Amanda is confused and worried. If word got out that Graham was alive, the legend of Graham and Amanda would be done for. Even Graham's suggestion that he live with her incognito is no good; after all, if Amanda were to live with another man, the legend would still be destroyed. The encounter ends up with Amanda pointing a gun at Graham ... but at the last second she decides to shoot herself. Graham is heartbroken. Not only has he lost Amanda, the secret of his real identity is lost for good. He tries to forget what has happened, but there are reminders everywhere. He hears \\"their song\\" at a local saloon, and walks in on a stage production of From Noon Till Three. Worse, people he knew slightly laugh when he says he is Graham, since he looks nothing like his description in the book. Ultimately he is arrested and put in an insane asylum, where he meets the only people who believe him: his fellow inmates. He seems relieved.

In 1822, under the rule of Ioan Sturdza (the first non- Phanariote prince in Moldavia), IonicƒÉ TƒÉutu advanced a thorough constitutional project, which soon became highly controversial. The new law proposed habeas corpus, free trade, as well as a radical definition of private ownership which denied confiscation under any circumstances;Hitchins, p.174 at the same time, it called for a reform of the traditional government by the prince and the estates of the realm (the Boyar Divan), which placed virtually all powers with the latter - thus attempting to preserve privileges obtained by boyars in the previous decades. Nevertheless, TƒÉutu was a cautious adversary of the French Revolution, which he likened to \\"the anarchy of crowds\\".Hitchins, p.172 Given that high-ranking boyars had come to dominate the political landscape (and an inner-circle of families had effectively blocked several Phanariote reforms),Djuvara, p.124 TƒÉutu met stiff opposition from the political class: his reforms also attempted to increase representation for low-ranking boyars - a group otherwise threatened with extinction.Djuvara, p.319 The most noted adversary of his project was Mihail Sturdza (future prince), who rejected all decrease in influence for the high- ranking boyars. Ultimately, the Russian consulate in Ia»ôi, which had progressively gained influence in internal politics between the 1774 Treaty of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca and the Greek War of Independence, called for the initiative to be stopped, citing previous treaties between the Ottoman Empire (Moldavia's suzerain) and Russia, as well as the will of Emperor Alexander I of Russia. TƒÉutu retreated from public life and died in self-exile in Istanbul. Legacy His image was held in esteem by radical of later generations, and often offered as an example of nationalist revival. Alecu Russo, who wrote his memoirs in the 1850s, described TƒÉutu as \\"the revived Romanianness, carried along by all patriotic sentiments, and having the same role as the one Vladimirescu [the leader of the previous Wallachian uprising] had with a peasant rifle\\".

It was one of two mountain infantry divisions of Poland to take part in the Invasion of Poland of 1939. Currently its traditions are continued by Polish 21st Podhale Rifles Brigade. Until 1939 the unit was commanded by Gen.bryg. J√≥zef Kustro≈Ñ and was stationed in and around the towns of Nowy SƒÖcz, Bielsko, Cieszyn, Bogumin, Krak√≥w. Along with 11th Infantry and 22nd Mountain Infantry Divisions, the 21st was notable for its distinctive uniforms, based on folk attire of the Gorals (Polish highlanders) rather than standard uniforms of the Polish Army. During the Invasion of Poland, the division was attached to Bielsko Operational Group of the Krak√≥w Army. It defended the line of Cieszyn-Bogumin in the region of Zaolzie. Following the steady withdrawal eastwards, it was victorious in the battles of Krzywoczka and Mogilany along the Dunajec. Attacked on September 6 by superior forces of the German 2nd Panzer Division and German 4th Panzer Division, parts of its shielding forces managed to withdraw to the other side of the river, blowing the bridges in Bobrowniki up. At the same time, a major part of the division was assaulted prior to the river crossing and had to withdraw northwards, where it joined with the Polish 6th Infantry Division near the town of Biskupice. Finally, the division managed to escape from German forces and cross the San river overnight of September 12 near Jaros≈Çaw. Between September 13 and September 16 the division took part in heavy fights of Gen. Boruta- Spiechowicz's operational group in the vicinity of Oleszyce, Futor√≥w, Cewk√≥w and U≈Çaz√≥w. There the division, by then reduced to merely 4,000 soldiers, managed to withstand a three days long assault of German 45th and 28th Infantry Divisions. However, on September 16 the remnants of the 21st Mountain Division were finally surrounded and most of them either capitulated or were disbanded by their commanders. The division's commanding officer, J√≥zef Kustro≈Ñ, was killed on the battlefield while personally leading his soldiers in an assault.

Mind-wandering tends to occur when one is driving. This is because driving under optimal conditions becomes an almost automatic activity that can require minimal use of the task positive network, the brain network that is active when one is engaged in an attention-demanding activity. In situations where vigilance is low, people do not remember what happened in the surrounding environment because they are preoccupied with their thoughts. This is known as the decoupling hypothesis. Studies using event-related potentials (ERPs) have quantified the extent that mind-wandering reduces the cortical processing of the external environment. When thoughts are unrelated to the task at hand, the brain processes both task-relevant and unrelated sensory information in a less detailed manner. Mind-wandering appears to be a stable trait of people and a transient state. Studies have linked performance problems in the laboratory and in daily life. Mind- wandering has been associated with possible car accidents. Mind-wandering is also intimately linked to states of affect. Studies indicate that task- unrelated thoughts are common in people with low or depressed mood. Mind- wandering also occurs when a person is intoxicated via the consumption of alcohol. Studies have demonstrated a prospective bias to spontaneous thought because individuals tend to engage in more future than past related thoughts during mind-wandering. The default mode network is thought to be involved in mind-wandering and internally directed thought, although recent work has challenged this assumption. History The history of mind-wandering research dates back to 18th century England. British philosophers struggled to determine whether mind-wandering occurred in the mind or if an outside source caused it. In 1921, Varendonck published The Psychology of Day-Dreams, in which he traced his \\"'trains of thoughts' to identify their origins, most often irrelevant external influences\\". Wallas (1926) considered mind-wandering as an important aspect of his second stage of creative thought ‚Äì incubation. It wasn't until the 1960s that the first documented studies were conducted on mind-wandering. John Antrobus and Jerome L. Singer developed a questionnaire and discussed the experience of mind-wandering. This questionnaire, known as the Imaginal Processes Inventory (IPI), provides a trait measure of mind- wandering and it assesses the experience on three dimensions: how vivid the person's thoughts are, how many of those thoughts are guilt- or fear-based, and how deep into the thought a person goes. As technology continues to develop, psychologists are starting to use functional magnetic resonance imaging to observe mind-wandering in the brain and reduce psychologists' reliance on verbal reports. Research methods Jonathan Smallwood and colleagues popularized mind-wandering using thought sampling and questionnaires. Mind-wandering is studied using experience sampling either online or retrospectively. One common paradigm within which to study mind- wandering is the SART (sustained attention to response) task. In a SART task there are two categories of words. One of the categories are the target words. In each block of the task a word appears for about 300 ms, there will be a pause and then another word. When a target word appears the participant hits a designated key. About 60% of the time after a target word a thought probe will appear to gauge whether thoughts were on task. If participants were not engaged in the task they were experiencing task-unrelated thoughts (TUTs), signifying mind-wandering. Another task to judge TUTs is the experience sampling method (ESM). Participants carry around a personal digital assistant (PDA) that signals several times a day. At the signal a questionnaire is provided. The questionnaire questions vary but can include: (a) whether or not their minds had wandered at the time of the (b) what state of control they had over their thoughts and (c) about the content of their thoughts. Questions about context are also asked to measure the level of attention necessary for the task. One process used was to give participants something to focus on and then at different times ask them what they were thinking about. Those who were not thinking about what was given to them were considered \\"wandering\\". Another process was to have participants keep a diary of their mind-wandering. Participants are asked to write a brief description of their mind-wandering and the time in which it happened. These methodologies are improvements on past methods that were inconclusive. Neuroscience Mind-wandering is important in understanding how the brain produces what William James called the train of thought and the stream of consciousness. This aspect of mind- wandering research is focused on understanding how the brain generates the spontaneous and relatively unconstrained thoughts that are experienced when the mind wanders. One candidate neural mechanism for generating this aspect of experience is a network of regions in the frontal and parietal cortex known as the default network. This network of regions is highly active even when participants are resting with their eyes closed suggesting a role in generating spontaneous internal thoughts. One relatively controversial result is that periods of mind-wandering are associated with increased activation in both the default and executive system a result that implies that mind- wandering may often be goal oriented. It is commonly assumed that the default mode network is known to be involved during mind-wandering. The default mode network is active when a person is not focused on the outside world and the brain is at wakeful rest because experiences such as mind-wandering and daydreaming are common in this state. It is also active when the individual is thinking about others, thinking about themselves, remembering the past, and planning for the future. However, recent studies show that signals in the default mode network provide information regarding patterns of detailed experience in active tasks states. These data suggest that the relationship between the default mode network and mind-wandering remains a matter of conjecture. In addition to neural models, computational models of consciousness based on Bernard Baars' Global Workspace theory suggest that mind-wandering, or \\"spontaneous thought\\" may involve competition between internally and externally generated activities attempting to gain access to a limited capacity central network. Individual differences There are individual differences in some aspects of mind-wandering between older and younger adults. Although older adults reported less mind-wandering, these older participants showed the same amount of mind-wandering as younger adults. There were also differences in how participants responded to an error. After an error, older adults took longer to return focus back to the task when compared with younger adults. It is possible that older adults reflect more about an error due to conscientiousness. Research has shown that older adults tend to be more conscientious than young adults. Personality can also affect mind-wandering. People that are more conscientious are less prone to mind- wandering. Being more conscientious allows people to stay focused on the task better which causes fewer instances of mind-wandering. Differences in mind- wandering between young and older adults may be limited because of this personality difference. Mental disorders such as ADHD are linked to mind- wandering. Seli et. al. (2015) found that spontaneous mind-wandering, the uncontrolled or unwarranted shifting of attention, is a characteristic of those who have ADHD. However, they note that deliberate mind-wandering, or the purposeful shifting of one's attention to different stimuli, is not a consistent characteristic of having ADHD. Franklin et. al. (2016) arrived at similar conclusions; they had college students take multiple psychological evaluations that gauge ADHD symptom strength. Then, they had the students read a portion of a general science textbook. At various times and at random intervals throughout their reading, participants were prompted to answer a question that asked if their attention was either on task, slightly on task, slightly off task, or off task prior to the interruption. In addition, they were asked if they were aware, unaware, or neither aware nor unaware of their thoughts as they read. Lastly, they were tasked to press the space bar if they ever caught themselves mind-wandering. For a week after these assessments, the students answered follow-up questions that also gauged mind-wandering and awareness. This study‚Äôs results revealed that students with higher ADHD symptomology showed less task-oriented control than those with lower ADHD symptomology. Additionally, those with lower ADHD symptomology were more likely to engage in useful or deliberate mind-wandering and were more aware of their inattention. One of the strengths of this study is that it was performed in both lab and daily-life situations, giving it broad application. It should be noted, however, that mind-wandering in and of itself is not necessarily indicative of attention deficiencies. Studies show that humans typically spend 25-50% of their time thinking about thoughts irrelevant to their current situations. In many disorders it is the regulation of the overall amount of mind-wandering that is disturbed, leading to increased distractibility when performing tasks. Additionally, the contents of mind-wandering is changed; thoughts can be more negative and past-oriented, particularly unstable or self-centered. Working memory One important question facing the study of mind-wandering is how it relates to working memory capacity. Recent research has studied the relationship between mind-wandering and working memory capacity. Working memory capacity represents personal skill to have a good command of individual's mind. This relationship requires more research to understand how they influence one another. It is possible that mind-wandering causes lower performance on working memory capacity tasks or that lower working memory capacity causes more instances of mind-wandering. Although only this last one has actually been proven. Also, reports of task-unrelated thoughts are less frequent when performing tasks that do not demand continuous use of working memory than tasks which do. Moreover, individual difference studies demonstrate that when tasks are non-demanding, high levels of working memory capacity are associated with more frequent reports of task-unrelated thinking especially when it is focused on the future. By contrast, when performing tasks that demand continuous attention, high levels of working memory capacity are associated with fewer reports of task-unrelated thoughts. Together these data are consistent with the claim that working memory capacity helps sustain a train of thought whether it is generated in response to a perceptual event or is self-generated by the individual. Therefore, under certain circumstances, the experience of mind-wandering is supported by working memory resources. Working memory capacity variation in individuals has been proven to be a good predictor of the natural tendency for mind-wandering to occur during cognitively demanding tasks and various activities in daily life. Mind-wandering sometimes occurs as a result of saccades, which are the movements of one's eyes to different visual stimuli. In an antisaccade task, for example, subjects with higher working memory capacity scores resisted looking at the flashing visual cue better than participants with lower working memory capacity. Higher working memory capacity is associated with fewer saccades toward environmental cues. Mind-wandering has been shown to be related to goal orientation; people with higher working memory capacity keep their goals more accessible than those who have lower working memory capacity, thus allowing these goals to better guide their behavior and keep them on task. Another study compared differences in speed of processing information between people of different ages. The task they used was a go/no go task where participants responded if a white arrow moved in a specific direction but did not respond if the arrow moved in the other direction or was a different color. In this task, children and young adults showed similar speed of processing but older adults were significantly slower. Speed of processing information affects how much information can be processed in working memory. People with faster speed of processing can encode information into memory better than people that have slower speed of processing. This can lead to memory of more items because more things can be encoded. Retention Mind- wandering affects retention where working memory capacity is directly related to reading comprehension levels. Participants with lower working memory capacity perform worse on comprehension-based tests. When investigating how mind-wandering affects retention of information, experiments are conducted where participants are asked a variety of questions about factual information, or deducible information while reading a detective novel. Participants are also asked about the state of their mind before the questions are asked. Throughout the reading itself, the author provides important cues to identify the villain, known as inference critical episodes (ICEs). The questions are asked randomly and before critical episodes are reached. It was found that episodes of mind-wandering, especially early on in the text led to decreased identification of the villain and worse results on both factual and deducible questions. Therefore, when mind-wandering occurs during reading, the text is not processed well enough to remember key information about the story. Furthermore, both the timing and the frequency of mind-wandering helps determine how much information is retained from the narrative. Reading comprehension Reading comprehension must also be investigated in terms of text difficulty. To assess this, researchers provide an easy and hard version of a reading task. During this task, participants are interrupted and asked whether their thoughts at the time of interruption had been related or unrelated to the task. What is found is that mind-wandering has a negative effect on text comprehension in more difficult readings. This supports the executive-resource hypothesis which describes that both task related and task- unrelated thoughts (TUT) compete for executive function resources. Therefore, when the primary task is difficult, little resources are available for mind- wandering, whereas when the task is simple, the possibility for mind-wandering is abundant because it takes little executive control to focus on simple tasks. However, mind-wandering tends to occur more frequently in harder readings as opposed to easier readings. Therefore, it is possible that similar to retention, mind-wandering increases when readers have difficulty constructing a model of the story. Happiness As part of his doctoral research at Harvard University, Matthew Killingsworth used an iPhone app that captured a user's feelings in real time. The tool alerts the user at random times and asks: \\"How are you feeling right now?\\" and \\"What are you doing right now?\\" Killingsworth and Gilbert's analysis suggested that mind-wandering was much more typical in daily activities than in laboratory settings. They also describe that people were less happy when their minds were wandering than when they were otherwise occupied. This effect was somewhat counteracted by people's tendency to mind-wander to happy topics, but unhappy mind-wandering was more likely to be rated as more unpleasant than other activities. The authors note that unhappy moods can also cause mind-wandering, but the time- lags between mind-wandering and mood suggests that mind-wandering itself can also lead to negative moods. Furthermore, research suggests that regardless of working memory capacity, subjects participating in mind-wandering experiments report more mind-wandering when bored, stressed, unhappy. Executive functions Executive functions (EFs) are cognitive processes that make a person pay attention or concentrate on a task. Three executive functions that relate to memory are inhibiting, updating and shifting. Inhibiting controls a person's attention and thoughts when distractions are abundant. Updating reviews old information and replaces it with new information in the working memory. Shifting controls the ability to go between multiple tasks. All three EFs have a relationship to mind-wandering. Executive functions have roles in attention problems, attention control, thought control, and working memory capacity. Attention problems relate to behavioral problems such as inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. These behaviors make staying on task difficult leading to more mind-wandering. Higher inhibiting and updating abilities correlates to lower levels of attention problems in adolescence. The inhibiting executive function controls attention and thought. The failure of cognitive inhibition is a direct cause of mind-wandering. Mind-wandering is also connected to working memory capacity (WMC). People with higher WMC mind- wander less on high concentration tasks no matter their boredom levels. People with low WMC are better at staying on task for low concentration tasks, but once the task increases in difficulty they had a hard time keeping their thoughts focused on task. Updating takes place in the working memory, therefore those with low WMC have a lower updating executive function ability. That means a low performing updating executive function can be an indicator of high mind-wandering. Working memory relies on executive functions, with mind- wandering as an indicator of their failure. task-unrelated thoughts (TUTs) are empirical behavioral manifestations of mind-wandering in a person. The longer a task is performed the more TUTs reported. Mind-wandering is an indication of an executive control failure that is characterized by TUTs.  Fidgeting  Paul Seli and colleagues have shown that spontaneous mind-wandering is associated with increased fidgeting; by contrast, interest, attention and visual engagement lead to Non-Instrumental Movement Inhibition. One possible application for this phenomenon is that detection of non-instrumental movements may be an indicator of attention or boredom in computer aided learning. Traditionally teachers and students have viewed fidgeting as a sign of diminished attention, which is summarized by the statement, ‚ÄúConcentration of consciousness, and concentration of movements, diffusion of ideas and diffusion of movements go together.‚Äù However, James Farley and colleagues have proposed that fidgeting is not only an indicator of spontaneous mind- wandering, but is also a subconscious attempt to increase arousal in order to improve attention and thus reduce mind-wandering.

He played at the halfback position, and also handled punting, for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football teams from 1933 to 1935. He gained his greatest acclaim for throwing the winning touchdown pass as time ran off the clock in Notre Dame's 1935 victory over Ohio State, a game that was voted the best game in the first 100 years of college football. Shakespeare was selected as a consensus first-team All-American in 1935 and was posthumously inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983. Sharing the same name as \\"The Bard of Avon\\", Shakespeare earned nicknames including \\"The Bard of Staten Island\\", \\"The Bard of South Bend\\", and \\"The Merchant of Menace.\\" Biography=Early years Shakespeare was born on Staten Island, New York. His father, Valentine Shakespeare, was a New York City firefighter and the captain of Fire Company 163. The family claimed to be direct descendants of the famed writer William Shakespeare. The younger Shakespeare became a star football player at Staten Island's Port Richmond High School. He showed particular talent as a punter and later told reporters that he had trained his pet fox terrier to retrieve his punts as he practiced his technique. Notre DameBard of Staten Island= He enrolled at the University of Notre Dame in 1932, the year after the death of the school's legendary football coach Knute Rockne. He played for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football teams in 1933, 1934, and 1935, and was selected as a consensus All-American in 1935. Because of his shared name with William Shakespeare, \\"The Bard of Avon\\", he acquired nicknames \\"The Bard of Staten Island\\" and \\"The Merchant of Menace.\\"(\\"Bill Shakespeare was nicknamed 'The Merchant of Menace' and, according to classmates, did not do well in English.\\") Newspapers reported that, though he claimed to be a direct descendant of the Bard, Shakespeare had flunked his sophomore English class. In 1934, newspapers published a photograph of Shakespeare staring at a football in the manner of Hamlet examining Yorick's skull under the caption \\"To Be Or Not To Be -- Football Player or English Wizard Is Perplexing Question Facing William Shakespeare, of Notre Dame.\\" =1933 and 1934 seasons= As a sophomore in 1933, Shakespeare was a substitute at the halfback position. He also showed promise as a punter with an average of 53.2 yards on five punts. As a junior in 1934, Shakespeare became the starting left halfback in the Notre Dame's first year under new coach Elmer Layden. In an October 1934 win over Carnegie Tech, Shakespeare ran 56 yards for a touchdown on a sweep play around the right end. The Associated Press noted: \\"Superb blocking opened the route for Shakespeare, who put a little reverse English on his dash and then outfooted the field to score.\\" On November 24, 1934, he helped lead the Irish to a 12-6 win over Army with a 67-yard touchdown pass to Dominic Vairo in front of a crowd of 81,000 at Yankee Stadium. The Associated Press wrote that \\"the Irish scored a touchdown on a sensational pass, Shakespeare to Captain Vairo, who took the ball on Army's 15 as he was surrounded by three cadets and broke away to spring across the goal line.\\" And in the final week of the season, he threw a 51-yard touchdown pass to Francis \\"Mike\\" Layden in a 14-0 win over the University of Southern California.The Fighting Irish Football Encyclopedia, p. 77. He led the 1934 Notre Dame team in several offensive categories, including passing (230 yards and two touchdowns), kickoff returns (60 yards on four returns), and punting (41 punts for 1,638 yards and a 40.0 yard average).The Notre Dame Football Encyclopedia, pp. 186 and 261. =1935 seasonEarly games In the opening game of the 1935 season, Shakespeare threw a pass from the 50-yard to Wayne Millner, who caught the ball on the five-yard line and ran into the endzone for a touchdown as Notre Dame defeated Kansas 28-7. The following week, Shakespeare ran for a touchdown against Carnegie Tech at Pitt Stadium‚Äîthe first touchdown scored by Notre Dame in Pittsburgh since 1931.The Fighting Irish Football Encyclopedia, p. 78. Against Wisconsin on October 12, 1935, he caught a 20-yard touchdown pass from Vic Wojcihovski to help lead Notre Dame to a 13-0 win at Camp Randall Stadium. In the fourth week of the 1935 season, Notre Dame beat Pitt, 9-6, as Shakespeare scored Notre Dame's only touchdown. Shakespeare also booted an 86-yard punt (70 yards in the air) in the Pitt game, still the longest punt in Notre Dame football history. He also kicked a 75-yard punt against Navy in 1935 that ranks as the fifth-longest in school history.The Notre Dame Football Encyclopedia, p. 274. \\"Game of the Century\\" On November 2, 1935, Notre Dame faced the undefeated 1935 Ohio State Buckeyes team in front of a crowd of 81,000 at Ohio Stadium. Ohio State was heavily favored in the game and led at half-time by a score of 13-0\\\\. The score remained the same at the start of the fourth quarter, but the Irish rallied in the fourth quarter for two touchdowns to narrow Ohio State's lead to 13-12\\\\. With less than a minute left in the game, Notre Dame's quarterback Andy Pilney ran for a 30-yard gain to the Ohio State 19-yard line. Pilney was injured on the play and had to be carried off the field on a stretcher. Shakespeare replaced Pilney and threw a pass into the arms of an Ohio State player who intercepted the ball but dropped it before securing possession.The Fighting Irish Football Encyclopedia, p. 80. With the clock running out, the ball was snapped to fullback Jim McKenna, who handed it to Shakespeare on what appeared to be a reverse. Shakespeare threw a pass into the endzone, which was caught by Wayne Millner on his knees for an 18-13 win. The 1935 Notre Dame-Ohio State match was regarded as one of the greatest comebacks in history of the sport. Red Barber, who broadcast the game on radio, later called it \\"the greatest college football game I ever called.\\" In The New York Times, Allison Danzig opened his report on the game by writing, \\"One of the greatest last-ditch rallies in football history toppled the dreaded Scarlet Scourge of Ohio State from its lofty pinnacle today as 81,000 dumbfounded spectators saw Notre Dame score three touchdowns in less than fifteen minutes to gain an almost miraculous 18-13 victory in jammed Buckeye Stadium.\\"Sperber, Shake Down the Thunder, pp. 435-436. Radio announcer Tom Manning added, \\"I always said Shakespeare had a pair of rosary beads and a bottle of holy water in his back pocket.\\" The media picked up stories of the Catholic faithful praying for Notre Dame as they listened to the game on the radio. One nun told a reporter of overhearing a colleague in her convent \\"gamefully bargaining\\" and eventually \\"threatening\\" the Poor Souls and saints for another Notre Dame touchdown. The Chicago Tribune later noted the irony that it was a truly ecumenical group that combined for the famed \\"Hail Mary\\" pass: \\"Mazziotti, a Catholic, handed to Shakespeare, a Protestant on a fake reverse. Shakespeare passed to End Wayne Millner, a Jewish boy.\\" In 1969, as part of the centennial of the first college football game, the Associated Press conducted a poll to select the \\"game of the century\\", and the 1935 Notre Dame-Ohio State game was chosen as the best game in the first 100 years of college football.The Fighting Irish Football Encyclopedia, p. 79. Later games The week after the Ohio State game, Notre Dame faced Northwestern featuring All-American end Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Before the game, the Associated Press carried a story profiling the two players: \\"Shakespeare and Longfellow will meet tomorrow ‚Äî- not to trade verses, but to play all the football they know.\\" Longfellow later recalled, \\"Shakespeare and I played against each other for three years. Each year, because of our names, we got a terrific buildup. It was a natural, I suppose. All through my college days I never heard the end of it. The writers went wilder each year.\\" Longfellow got the better of Shakespeare in 1935, as he caught a touchdown pass to help Northwestern win the game, 14-7. Shakespeare attempted to lead the Irish to another come-from-behind victory, as he ran 48 yard to the Northwestern ten-yard line late in the game, but the Northwestern defense held. On the last play of the game, Shakespeare threw a \\"long, desperate pass\\", but it was intercepted as time ran out. On November 16, 1935, Shakespeare led a Notre Dame comeback against Army, but the comeback fell short as the game ended in a 6-6 tie. The game was played in Yankee Stadium in front of a crowd of 80,000, and Army led 6-0 late in the game. With a minute to go, Shakespeare threw a 44-yard pass to Millner at the Army goal line. The ball fell from Millner's arms, but the referee called pass interference and Notre Dame scored on the next play from the two-yard line. Damon Runyon wrote of the finish: \\"It is the opening gun, so to speak, of the duel with William Valentine Shakespeare, who waits until the very last minute to put on a typical Shakespeare finish to a Notre Dame football tale.\\" Shakespeare concluded his football career with a come-from-behind victory over the USC Trojans On November 23, 1935. USC led 6-0 at halftime, but Notre Dame scored 20 points in the second half. The Associated Press credited Shakespeare for leading the comeback: \\"Heading the brilliant attack was the 'bard of Staten Island,' William Shakespeare who closed his collegiate career with one of his greatest games.\\" Shakespeare started the rally by throwing a 38-yard touchdown pass to Wally Fromhart. Post-season honors Shakespeare finished the 1935 college football season as Notre Dame's leader in most offensive categories, including passing (19 completions on 66 attempts for 267 yards), rushing (374 yards and four touchdowns on 104 carries),The Notre Dame Football Encyclopedia, p. 186. punting (1,801 yards on 45 punts), kickoff returns (123 yards on five returns), and scoring (24 points).The Notre Dame Football Encyclopedia, p. 267. He was selected as a consensus first-team All- American and finished third in the voting, behind Jay Berwanger and Monk Moscrip, for the first Heisman Trophy award. NFL Draft Shakespeare was drafted in the first round (3rd overall selection) of the 1936 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers. The 1936 draft was the first official NFL draft, and Shakespeare holds the distinction of being the third player ever selected in an NFL draft, the first Notre Dame player to be drafted in the first round,The Notre Dame Football Encyclopedia, p. 285 (\\"Notre Dame has had 55 first-round draft picks, beginning with Bill Shakespeare by Pittsburgh in 1936.\\"). and the first first-round pick for the Steelers.(\\"With their first-ever, first-round selection, the Steelers chose a Notre Dame All-American back named William Shakespeare. Shakespeare never played for the team and as far as is known in literary circles, never penned a sonnet extolling the Steelers, either.\\") Despite being drafted in the first round, professional football was not a high-paying proposition in the mid-1930s, and Shakespeare opted for a career in business rather than professional football. Before turning to a career in business, Shakespeare did take time to appear with fellow All-Americans Jay Berwanger, Bobby Wilson, Monk Moscrip and Gomer Jones in the RKO Pictures feature film, The Big Game. World War II In July 1943, Shakespeare entered the U.S. Army and went overseas with the Ground Forces Reinforcement Command of the 106th Division. He was commissioned as a captain and commanded a machine-gun platoon of the 424th Infantry Regiment, which played a prominent role in the Ardennes breakthrough, and served in Northern France and the Rhineland Campaign. Shakespeare was awarded four battle stars, the Combat Infantryman Badge, and the Bronze Star for gallantry during the Battle of the Bulge. Later years Shakespeare joined the Cincinnati Rubber Company upon graduating from Notre Dame in 1936. With exception of the time he spent in military service during World War II, Shakespeare spent his entire career with the company. By 1959, he had become a vice president of the company, and he became the company's president in 1960. He lived in Kenwood, Ohio and remained president of Cincinnati Rubber until his death in 1974. He died in January 1974 at age 61 at Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati. He was survived by his wife and two sons. Awards In 1983, Shakespeare was posthumously named to the College Football Hall of Fame and he has also been inducted into the Staten Island Sports Hall of Fame.

Ebony was formerly an island surrounded by marsh and the tidal waters of the River Rother. At the top of the most prominent part of the high ground, known as Chapel Bank, is the churchyard of the original Ebony Church, St Mary the Virgin. After lightning and fire damage the remains of the church, built of local ragstone, were moved by the Victorians in 1858 to the present location at nearby Reading Street, and restored. It has been suggested that references to King Osred II of Northumbria's exile at 'Ebonia' (Evania) in the Annals of Roger of Hoveden may refer to the strategically-situated Ebony in the marshlands of the South Coast, rather than to the Isle of Man or the Hebrides. The fact that the church at Ebony was of Saxon foundation has been cited in support for this hypothesis; however there is no evidence for a 9th-century date for the church and the earliest reference is from 1070. An annual pilgrimage from the Reading Street site of the church to the original site on Chapel Bank occurs in September. The nearby church of the village of Stone-cum-Ebony, on the Isle of Oxney, is also dedicated to St Mary the Virgin, and should not be confused with Ebony church ReferencesExternal links * Ebony Kent Local Tourism and Information web site Villages in the Borough of Ashford Hamlets in Kent ","title":"Ebony, Kent"},{"id":"6331852","text":"Iv√°n Moro Fern√°ndez (born December 25, 1974 in Madrid) is a water polo player from Spain, who was a member of the national team that won the gold medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia.

His poems focus on the gaps in reality, and his poetry is influenced by the art of discretion, a stage for painful absence. Based on a distrust of the present, Zivlak refers to metaphysical knowledge and places the action of the subject over the modern in the foreground. As an expression of metaphysical self-exploration his language transmits clear and solidly structured images, fragmentary impressions and deep reflections that seek to decode the mystery of the modern world. \\"Zivlak's spiritual and philosophical views provide the backdrop to their own morphology of society and culture in which the ambivalent role of man in relation to nature is expressed and, moreover, his position within his own culture and history is explored.\\" (Dr Dragan Prole, Faculty of Philosophy, University of Novi SadDr Dragan Prole).

Merritt returned to the AIMS program in 1978 where he made his European debut in a concert broadcast live from Graz' Schloss Eggenberg on ORF Austrian National Radio, singing Jan√°ƒçek's song-cycle The Diary of One who Vanished and collaborating with pianist Norman Shettler.

The short, set in the Cars world, tells a story of Mater being haunted by a mysterious blue light. Plot The short opens with Mater pranking the other residents of Radiator Springs by moving Red's flowers, bursting out from a pile of tires to jumpscare Guido and Luigi, dressing up as a cone vampire to scare Sally, attempting to scare Lizzie while she's sleeping (which is unsuccessful), moving Fillmore's gas cans back outside while he takes them in and finally jumpscaring Lightning McQueen when he believes Mater is hiding behind a pile of cans ready to jump out (what was really behind the pile of cans is one of Mater's signs). This sequence then culminates with Mater teasing McQueen as if he had seen \\"the Ghostlight,\\" a Route 66 urban legend. Sheriff admonishes him for mocking the urban legend. When McQueen asks about the Ghostlight, Sheriff explains that the Ghostlight is a blue paranormal orb of light that haunts Radiator Springs, but Mater reminds Lightning that it is not real. Sheriff points out that it is real, shocking them. He then tells everyone the tale of the Ghostlight, explaining the disappearance of a young couple that encountered it, leaving behind two \\"out-of-state license plates\\" and that it hates nothing more than the sound of clanking metal. At this point, Mater is so scared that he begins making the noise that the Ghostlight dislikes the most and tries to stop himself. Sheriff ends the story with a warning that the Ghostlight could be anywhere. The rest of the gang say goodnight and turn off all the store lights, leaving a nervous and scared Mater all alone in the dark. Nervous, he returns to his junkyard and sees a shadow of a monster and, in a sudden shock, shines his light on it, revealing it to be just a pile of junk with another of his signs. After he accidentally breaks his headlights in fear, he enters his wall-less garage and closes the door, which then falls down. A light suddenly appears in front of him and he panics, believing it to be the Ghostlight until he realizes it is just a lighting bug (actually resembling a Volkswagen Bug). Suddenly, a blue light appears behind him. After using his mirror to observe it, he runs for it thinking it is that Ghostlight. For the remainder of the short, mayhem ensues as Mater is pursued by the Ghostlight, ultimately revealed to be just a lantern affixed to Mater's towing cable by Lightning and Guido. He drives into Willy's Butte and wakes Frank and his tractors and goes into slow motion where he sounds like a bull. The other residents of Radiator Springs watch as Mater drives around frantically with the \\"Ghostlight\\" on his tail, before Mater tires himself out and discovers the truth. The cars tell him it was all a prank to pay him back for all his pranks he played on them. Sheriff gently tells Mater that the only thing to be scared of on Route 66 is \\"his imagination.\\" Doc jokingly adds that all Mater really had to fear was \\"the Screaming Banshee\\" before they all leave Mater, alone and frightened once again. In a post-credits scene, Mater actually encounters the Screaming Banshee (which is actually an enormous truck who is both a monster truck and a construction vehicle with a broken windshield and a \\"BANSHEE\\" logo on the front) on the road, but unaware it is him, warns him of the Banshee before departing for the safety of his junkyard once again, leaving the Screaming Banshee confused.

It is located north of the island of New Guinea, separated from it by the Vitiaz Strait. Geography Two stratovolcanoes are located on the island: Mount Reaumur and Cerisy Peak. The summit of the volcanic complex collapsed during at least three major explosive eruptions, about 16,000, 4000, and 300 years ago. These produced a large caldera 10 x 12.5 km in size, now filled with a freshwater crater lake, Lake Wisdom. In 1953-1954 and 1968, volcanic activity created Motmot Island on the crater lake, 200 x 200 m in size. The 1660 eruption was one of the largest in Papua New Guinea's recent history with an estimated air- fall volume in excess of 11 cu km, comparable to the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, but the Global Volcanism Program gives a much higher estimate of 30 cu km. This cataclysmic event prompted legends of a \\"Time of Darkness\\". The most recent (and a smaller) eruption occurred in 1993. History The first sighting by Europeans of Long Island was by the Spanish navigator I√±igo √ìrtiz de Retes on 12 August 1545 when on board of the carrack San Juan he tried to return from Tidore to New Spain.Coello, Francisco \\"Conflicto hispano-alem√°n\\" Bolet√≠n de Sociedad Geogr√°fica de Madrid, t.XIX. 2¬∫ semestre 1885, Madrid, p.371. Long Island was charted in 1643 by Abel Tasman but he mistook it for part of the New Guinea mainland. Long Island was utilised as a barge staging area by the Imperial Japanese during World War II. On December 26, 1943, D Company of the 592d Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment, 2d Engineer Special Brigade, US Army, landed on Long Island to prepare a radar station as part of the Battle of Cape Gloucester. The Royal Australian Air Force No. 338 Radar Station was set up at Matfum Point and became operational on April 6, 1944 and was to remain until March 1945.

Catholic High School was founded in 1894 as St. Vincent's Academy. It offers grades eight through twelve. History Catholic High School was founded in 1894 as St. Vincent's Academy. The school was so named in recognition of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, who helped organize and establish the school. The original site of the school was an old frame building in downtown Baton Rouge, and the enrollment was 106 students. By the 1920s, the enrollment had grown to approximately 300 students, and in 1928, the Brothers of the Sacred Heart built a new school, gym, and brother's residence at the corner of North Street and Fourth Street, and was renamed to Catholic High School. In the 1930s and 1940s, the school's enrollment continued to increase, prompting the Brothers to acquire of land in midtown Baton Rouge to build a campus to accommodate a larger student body, which was donated by R. Frank Cangelosi. After 10 years of delayed construction, Catholic High School, with its student body of 450 students, moved to its present location at 855 Hearthstone Drive in September 1957. The original buildings on the new campus included a residence for brothers and teachers, a small building used as a PE locker room and band room, and the main building. The main building at the time contained several offices, a library, six classrooms, and a few science lab classrooms. In 1963, the gymnasium was built. In 1971, the R. Frank Cangelosi Mall was built between the main building and gym for student use as an auxiliary cafeteria. In 1972, a new student wing, containing six classrooms, a cafeteria called the Union, and a library was added; the original library was converted into a faculty workroom. The Brother Gordian Science Center, Catholic High's newest building, was finished in 2005. In the early 1980s, a football practice field and baseball field were added, along with an all-weather track (which was renovated and repaved in 2000). In 1985, the Fine Arts-Computer Center, containing a computer lab and classroom, a band room, a chorus room, art room, drafting room, and several classrooms was added. Around this time, the original band room was converted into a weight room. In 1990, a maintenance shed was added, and in 1991, in preparation for the school's 100th anniversary, the Centennial Courtyard was built. Also in the early 1990s, the school purchased three homes across the street from the campus to use as additional offices. In the fall of 2002, the gymnasium was renovated to install air conditioning, and at that time CHS dedicated a new Health and Physical Education Center with a weight room, a wrestling room, locker rooms for athletes and PE students, and two new classrooms. In 2005, the Brother Gordian Udinsky Science Center, containing updated science labs for biology, chemistry, and physics, a new computer lab, and several classrooms, was dedicated and opened. On October 14th, 2020 Catholic High school announced to it's students the opening of the Brother Donnan Berry Student Union. The state of the art building includes new classrooms upstairs and downstairs a mess hall for students to gather and eat in. {{cite web  url=https://catholichigh.org/advancingthemission/title=Union Academics CHS offers 21 AP courses including US History, World History, Calculus, English Literature, Statistics, Psychology, French, and Biology.

The show was part of a broader mid-20th-century movement to popularize serious music. From 1928 to 1942, orchestra conductor Walter Damrosch hosted the show. Radio Guide (March 18, 1939) commented: :In this music workshop Dr. Walter Damrosch analyzes types of compositions, illustrates functions and effects of instruments, reviews and compares the works of outstanding composers to promote an enjoyment of good music through an understanding of it.OTTRpedia Except for the West Coast, Music Appreciation Hour was broadcast during school hours, and NBC provided teachers with supplementary materials. It also aired on Saturdays; in Nashville, Tennessee, local NBC affiliate WSM aired the program immediately before its weekly barn dance broadcast. A comment from Damrosch on a 1928 broadcast about there being no room in the classics for realism prompted host George D. Hay to comment how much the barn dance contrasted with the classics: as opposed to grand opera, Hay's program presented the Grand Ole Opry, thus offhandedly giving that program the name it has held for nine decades since.

Darboven (mid 20th century) German coffee substitute, Feigen-Caffee, historical advertisement (late 19th century) Coffee substitutes are non-coffee products, usually without caffeine, that are used to imitate coffee. Coffee substitutes can be used for medical, economic and religious reasons, or simply because coffee is not readily available. Roasted grain beverages are common substitutes for coffee. In World War II, acorns were used to make coffee, as were roasted chicory and grain. Postum, a bran and molasses beverage also became a popular coffee substitute during this time. During the American Civil War coffee was also scarce in the South: Coffee substitutes are sometimes used in preparing foods served to children or to people who avoid caffeine, or in the belief that they are healthier than coffee. For religious reasons, members of churches such as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and the Seventh-day Adventist Church, refrain from drinking coffee,Mormon scripture: Doctrine and Covenants section 89, 1‚Äì9; written in 1833 but not all hot drinks;The LDS Church interprets \\"hot drinks\\" to mean coffee and tea. some may drink a substitute.In the same section of scripture, an alternative for coffee is offered Some Asian culinary traditions include beverages made from roasted grain instead of roasted coffee beans (including barley tea, corn tea, and brown rice tea); these do not substitute for coffee but fill a similar niche as a hot aromatic drink (optionally sweetened). Ingredients Grain coffee and other substitutes can be made by roasting or decocting various organic substances. Some ingredients used include almond, acorn, asparagus, malted barley, beechnut, beetroot, carrot, chicory root, corn, soybeans, cottonseed, dandelion root (see dandelion coffee), fig, roasted garbanzo beans, lupinus, boiled-down molasses, okra seed, pea, persimmon seed, potato peel,Potato Coffee rye, sassafras pits, sweet potato, wheat bran. History The Native American people of what is now the Southeastern United States brewed a ceremonial drink containing caffeine, \\"asi\\", or the \\"black drink\\", from the roasted leaves and stems of Ilex vomitoria (Yaupon holly). European colonists adopted this beverage as a coffee-substitute, which they called \\"cassina\\". In Quebec, the seeds of the black locust were historically used as a coffee substitute, before the stem borer decimated populations of the tree. A coffee substitute from ground, roasted chickpeas was mentioned by a German writer in 1793. Dandelion coffee is attested as early as the 1830s in North America. The drink brewed from ground, roasted chicory root has no caffeine, but is dark and tastes much like coffee. It was used as a medicinal tea before coffee was introduced to Europe. Use of chicory as a coffee substitute became widespread in France early in the 19th century due to coffee shortages resulting from the Continental Blockade. It was used during the American Civil War in Louisiana, and remains popular in New Orleans. Chicory mixed with coffee is also popular in South India, and is known as Indian filter coffee. Postum is an instant type of coffee substitute made from roasted wheat bran, wheat and molasses. It reached its height of popularity in the United States during World War II when coffee was sharply rationed.

Life and career Speckled Red was born in Hampton, Georgia. He was the older brother of Piano Red. Their nicknames were derived from both men being albinos. The brothers were separated by almost a generation and never recorded together. Speckled Red and Piano Red both played in a raucous goodtime barrelhouse boogie-woogie style, although Speckled Red played slow blues more often. Both recorded versions of \\"The Right String (But the Wrong Yo-Yo)\\", Speckled Red in 1930 and Piano Red, who had a hit with the song 20 years later. Prior to his birth the family had moved for brief periods to Detroit, Michigan, and then Atlanta, Georgia, after his father violated Jim Crow laws, before settling in Hampton, Georgia. The family, consisting of Perryman and seven brothers and sisters, had little musical background. Speckled Red was a self-taught piano player, influenced primarily by his idol Fishtail and by Charlie Spand, James Hemingway and William Ezell and initially inspired by Paul Seminole in a movie theatre. He also learned to play the organ at his church. By his mid-teens he was playing house parties and juke joints. He moved back to Detroit in his mid-20s to play anywhere he could, including nightclubs and brothels, and was noticed by a Brunswick Records talent scout just before he left for Memphis, Tennessee, where he was located by Jim Jackson. It was here that he had his first recording sessions, resulting in two classics for Brunswick, \\"Wilkins Street Stomp\\" and the hit \\"The Dirty Dozens\\". Although the lyrics were sung rather than spoken, with its elaborate wordplay and earthy subject matter, \\"The Dirty Dozens\\" is considered in some respects a precursor of rap music. \\"I want all you women to fall in line \\"And shake yo shimmy like i'm shakin' mine \\"You shake yo shimmy and you shake it fast \\"If you can't shake the shimmy, shake yo' yas yas yas\\" \\"You a dirty mistreater, a robber and a cheater \\"Stick you in a dozens and yo pappy is yo cousin \\"And yo mama do the lawdylawd\\" The following year, 1930, he recorded again, this time in Chicago, Illinois, resulting in most notably \\"The Dirty Dozens No. 2,\\" which was not nearly as successful and the pianist was without a contract or label and again playing making the rounds at Memphis venues and in St. Louis bars. His 1938 session work in Aurora, Illinois, with the slide guitar player Robert Nighthawk and the mandolinist Willie Hatcher for Bluebird Records, was steady and long but also unsuccessful, and sometime in the 1940s he moved back to St. Louis and continued his career of playing in taverns. He also worked as a laborer in a public produce market until servicemen returned home to heavy lifting jobs. Revival and death Charlie O'Brien, a St. Louis policeman and something of a blues aficionado who applied many of his professional investigative methods to track down old bluesmen during the 1950s, \\"rediscovered\\" Speckled Red on December 14, 1954, who subsequently was signed to Delmark Records as the label's first blues artist. He experienced a small revival of interest in his music during the late 1950s and 1960s, his abilities still considerable, and worked around the St. Louis-area jazz scene, regularly as the intermission pianist for the Dixie Stompers, performing concerts with Dixie Mantinee and the St. Louis Jazz Club, played the Goldenrod Showboat, and played the University of Chicago Folk Festival in 1961, went to Dayton, Ohio, with Gene Mayl's Dixieland Rhythm Kings, and toured Europe in 1959 with Chris Barber. Several recordings were made in 1956 and 1957 for the Tone, Delmark, Folkways, and Storyville record labels. His age, however, had become a factor, and the remainder of the 1960s saw scattered performances. He died of cancer on January 2, 1973, in St. Louis, at the age of 80.

It is a Grade II* Listed Building. History The Grand was designed by Victorian theatre architect Frank Matcham and was opened in 1894 after a construction period of seven months, at a cost of ¬£20,000 between December 1893 and July 1894. The project was conceived and financed by local theatre manager Thomas Sergenson who had been using the site of the Grand for several years to stage a circus. He had also transformed the fortunes of other local theatres. Matcham's brief was to build Sergenson the \\"prettiest theatre in the land\\". The Grand was Matcham's first theatre to use an innovative 'cantilever' design to support the tiers, thereby reducing the need for the usual pillars and so allowing clear views of the stage from all parts of the auditorium. Sergenson's successful directorship of the theatre ended in 1909 when he sold the operation to the Blackpool Tower Company for a considerable profit. The success of the Grand continued through World War I and on until the 1930s. The theatre now faced stiff competition from the newly introduced talking pictures and the building was operated as a cinema outside the summer tourist season. This practice continued until 1938 when the nearby Opera House was constructed. The Grand was able to stay open during World War II but the post- war rise in the popularity of television was probably the cause of the theatre's dwindling popularity toward the 1960s. The theatre's programme archives show that from 1964 the Grand was a summer seasonal venue. Plans were filed for the demolition of the historic site in 1972 but the Grand had become a Grade II* listed building earlier in the year, thanks to the initiative Jeffrey Finestone, a member of the Victorian Society. This enabled a group of theatre friends to successfully oppose any redevelopment. The theatre was unused for three years before an agreement was reached with the Grand's owners, EMI, that a refurbishment of the then unused building would take place if it could be used as a bingo hall. After three years of bingo use, the group of friends, now called the Friends of the Grand, with the support of Blackpool Borough Council negotiated to lease and eventually buy the theatre back from EMI over a period of a few years. The purchase was complete by 1 October 1980 and a refurbishment, achieved partly through voluntary effort, was begun. Finally, on 23 March 1981 the Grand re-opened as a theatre once again to stage an Old Vic performance of William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice featuring Timothy West and Prunella Scales. The theatre's return was further confirmed in May of the same year when a Royal Variety Performance was staged in the presence of Charles, Prince of Wales. Current status Inside the theatre The theatre saw its centenary in 1994 and a restoration project was begun in the 1990s that was completed in 2007 after fifteen years of work and about ¬£3million of investment. In 2006, the Grand was named the United Kingdom's National Theatre of Variety. The title was awarded nationally by Equity who staged an all-star gala performance to celebrate the theatre's new accolade. Since reopening in 1981, the board of directors of Blackpool Grand Theatre Trust Limited, theatre proprietors, has been led by chairmen John Hodgson (to 1981), W Geoffrey Thompson OBE (1982 to 1993), Samuel G Lee (1993 to 2003), David Coupe (2003 to 2009) and Anthony P Stone (2009 to present).  Friends of the Grand  The Friends of the Grand supports the Grand Theatre and its programme of events. Formed in 1973 to save the building from demolition, the first Friends were literally 'hands-on'. They painted the dressing rooms, repaired holes to the ceiling and helped to get the theatre into shape. Funds were raised in many ways, including Midnight Matin√©es; all part of the bid to save the theatre. Early Friends included Violet Carson, Alistair Cooke, Ken Dodd, Leslie Crowther, Timothy West, Prunella Scales, Billy Pearce and Johnnie Casson. The role of the Friends of the Grand has changed over the years. They now raise funds from subscriptions and social events to finance projects within the theatre, primarily aimed at enhancing the comfort of the patrons. The Friends have contributed in excess of ¬£750,800 towards projects including the provision of new carpets, seating and technical equipment. By Autumn 2008, the Friends had contributed almost ¬£250,000 to the Sam Lee Appeal to improve the amenities and to renovate the theatre interior. The Friends are also the founding angel of the National Theatre of Variety. ReferencesFurther reading Band, Barry (1993). Blackpool Grand Theatre, 1894-1930.

Matters were complicated by the fact that Julie's rich father did not approve of their less than luxurious lifestyle and often took it upon himself to try to improve it, much to Dave's chagrin. The series was produced by Screen Gems, the production company behind shows such as Gidget, Bewitched, and I Dream of Jeannie. It premiered on September 6, 1966 on ABC and stars Pete Duel, credited at the time as Peter Deuel, and Judy Carne in the leads. Also in the regular cast were Rich Little and Barbara Bostock as the Willis‚Äô neighbors, and Herb Voland and Edith Atwater as Julie's parents. All thirty episodes of the series were filmed in color. Plot Apprentice architect Dave Willis meets art student Julie Hammond when his liverwurst on pumpernickel sandwich falls into her bag while she is passing by a building on which he is working. In pursuit of his lunch, he chases after her until she stops in a local park. Upon getting his first good look at Julie, Dave loses interest in the sandwich and the two start to talk. So begins a whirlwind courtship that quickly leads to marriage, despite Dave's misgivings about getting married while he only makes $85.37 a week. In need of a new place to start their lives together, Julie finds an unfurnished converted store room with no windows that has one major perk: direct access to the roof of the apartment building which offers a beautiful view of San Francisco. Julie feels that the place has charm and atmosphere, plus the rent is cheap. The newlywed couple becomes friends with fellow tenants, Stan and Carol Parker. Stan quickly develops the habit of coming into their apartment unannounced in order to share his ideas with them. Also in the habit of showing up unannounced, although much less welcome than Stan, is Julie's father, Fred Hammond, who is always finding a way to meddle in Dave and Julie's lives, while his ever-patient wife, Phyllis, watches in amusement. Dave, however, is adamant that he and Julie will not accept Fred's help, especially if it is monetary, a stance that causes much contention between the two men. The humor in the series is formed, not simply out of the situations in which the characters find themselves, but out of the ways in which the differing personalities that regularly pass through the Willis‚Äô apartment react to the situations and, in the process, to each other. Characters Dave Willis (Pete Duel) is an apprentice architect who strongly believes in the importance of being practical. His wife, Julie Willis {born Julie Hammond} (Judy Carne), an art student, is the opposite, placing more emphasis on attending to the needs of the heart and soul than on keeping the budget. Fred Hammond (Herb Voland) is Julie's father. He owns nine used car lots and is quite wealthy because of it, a fact that he often points out to Dave. Fred is reluctant to let go of his daughter and spends much of his time trying to protect her from what he sees as the life of abject poverty to which Dave has doomed her. Phyllis Hammond (Edith Atwater) is much more understanding than her husband and does her best to welcome Dave into the family, even though Fred would prefer he get out. Stan (Rich Little) and Carol Parker (Barbara Bostock) live in the same apartment building as the Willises. Stan is an eccentric who never holds a steady job because he spends most of his time coming up with inventions and oddball moneymaking schemes. Carol is his devoted wife who has full faith in all of his ideas. Both are Dave and Julie's best friends.

In an interview conducted while the series was still in production, Judy Carne stated that she and co-star Pete Duel had \\"a love-hate relationship\\" and that many of the problems that they had on set were caused by Carne's insistence on punctuality and Duel's tendency to show up late.Melvin Durslag, TV Guide, \\"Judy Carne‚ÄîBrash, Confident, Scared!\\", cited at Alias Smith & Jones Collection.

When Pinocchio begs for Harlequin's life and offers to sacrifice himself in Harlequin's stead, he is refused by Mangiafuoco, who upon hearing that he is poor, gives Pinocchio five gold coins which are later seized by The Fox and the Cat (Il Gatto e la Volpe). In other media=Stromboli (Disney) In the 1940 animated Disney film Pinocchio, Mangiafuoco is renamed Stromboli (in the Italian dub of the film, \\"Mangiafuoco\\" is Stromboli's epithet). The character is voiced by Charles Judels (who also voiced The Coachman in the same film), and animated by Bill Tytla. Unlike Mangiafuoco, who meets Pinocchio by chance, Stromboli buys Pinocchio from Honest John and Gideon and earns a great deal of money by showing Pinocchio on stage. Stromboli is at first portrayed as gruff and rude but kind-hearted, but suddenly locks Pinocchio in a cage, stating that once he is too old to work, he will be used as firewood, revealing his true nature as brutal, cruel, vicious, and arrogant. Pinocchio escapes with the help of the Blue Fairy and Jiminy Cricket, but is berated for lying to her and ignoring Jiminy's advice. Like all the villains in the film, the final fate of Stromboli is never stated, revealed, or implied. However, some imply that his show went bankrupt after losing his star attraction. The trait is also shared with The Coachman. He is also the first Disney villain to not be evil at first. = Reception and analysis = Despite his limited screen time, Stromboli is one of Disney's most infamous and acclaimed villains. The character has been praised by critics for possessing the ability to instill in audiences both laughter and fear.Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, \\"The Disney Villain\\" (Hyperion, United States, 1993) Art critic Pierre Lambert has stated that \\"Tytla's innate sense of force is revealed in all its magnitude in the creation of the character of Stromboli,\\"Pierre Lambert, Pinocchio (Hyperion, Spain, 1995) and animation historian Charles Solomon refers to the puppet master as \\"the grandest of all Disney heavies,\\" while John Canemaker describes Stromboli as \\"an overweight monster of mercurial moods, capable of wine- soaked, garlic-breathed Old World charm one second, and knife-wielding, chop- you-up-for-firewood threats the next.\\"Charles Solomon, \\"The History of Animation Enchanted Drawings\\" (Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1989) William Paul drew some parallelism: > It is not too difficult to regard Stromboli as burlesque of a Hollywood > studio boss, complete with foreign accent. Disney's own relationship to the > Hollywood power structure was always a difficult one, and his distrust of > the moguls was well justified by his earliest experiences in the > industry.Robin Allan, \\"Walt Disney and Europe\\" (Indiana University Press, > Indiana, 1999) During the premiere of Pinocchio, Frank Thomas sat in front of W.C. Fields, who, upon Stromboli's entrance, muttered to whoever was with him that the puppet master \\"moves too much.\\" Michael Barrier agrees with Fields' criticism, considering Stromboli a \\"poorly conceived character\\" whose \\"passion has no roots... there is nothing in Stromboli of what could have made him truly terrifying.\\"Michael Barrier, Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in its Golden Age (Oxford University Press, New York, 1999) Leonard Maltin disagrees, considering Pinocchio's encounter with the showman to be the wooden boy's \\"first taste of the seamy side of life... (Stromboli) tosses his hatchet into the remnants of another ragged marionette, now a pile of splinters and sawdust, a meekly smiling face the only reminder of its former 'life'.\\"Leonard Maltin, The Disney Films (Disney Editions, New York, 2000) Though the character is Italian, characteristics such as Stromboli's facial expressions, obsession with wealth, and long black 'goat's beard' have led some to make comparisons with Jewish stereotypes (particularly Hollywood moguls). Later portrayals The Adventures of Pinocchio (1972) * In Giuliano Cenci's 1972 animated film The Adventures of Pinocchio (Un burattino di nome Pinocchio), Mangiafuoco's portrayal is true to the book in design and personality. In the English version he is renamed The Fire-Eater, translation of his original Italian name. He is voiced by Michele Gammino in the Italian version and by Bob Holt in the English dub. * He appears in the 1972 miniseries The Adventures of Pinocchio, portrayed by Lionel Stander. * Filmation's Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night features a puppet master named Puppetino voiced by William Windom. When Pinocchio runs away to a carnival with the idea of finding work, Puppetino recognises him from when he was a puppet. In a nightmarish sequence, Puppetino turns Pinocchio back into a lifeless, wooden puppet through an unexplained, magical process. It is implied strongly that he has done this to other children also. Puppetino speaks in a cockney accent and is a gaunt, pale-skinned man with a red moustache and hair, thick lips and a cloak. He is also a henchman and servant of the titular Emperor, who later turns on Puppetino for cowardice and turns him into a puppet before he is set in fire. * In Steve Barron's 1996 live action film The Adventures of Pinocchio, Mangiafuoco (who is played by Udo Kier) is renamed Lorenzini and is portrayed as the main antagonist of the film, encompassing three different villains from Collodi's story: the Puppet Master, The Coachman, and the Sea Monster. He initially adopts Pinocchio into his puppet troupe when he enlists Volpe and Felinet to bring Pinocchio to him. Lorenzini has a craving for chilli peppers, identified as the cause of his \\"fiery\\" breath. After Pinocchio accidentally sets Lorenzini's theatre on fire, Lorenzini begins luring bad naughty boys to Terra Magica, where the children inevitably drink cursed water which turns them into donkeys. Lorenzini, during a struggle with Pinocchio, falls into the water and becomes The Monstrous Whale. * In the Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child adaptation of Pinocchio, the character Mr. Buzzard (voiced by Garrett Morris) is based on Stromboli. Just like the Disney version, Red the Fox and Sporty the Cat sell Pinoak to him and Pinoak later escapes from him. In addition, Mr. Buzzard is seen in the shadows as the one who runs Fantastic Island. * In Geppetto (2000), a television film broadcast on The Wonderful World of Disney, Mangiafuoco (again named Stromboli) is portrayed by Brent Spiner. He is portrayed as an unsuccessful puppeteer who constantly argues with his ventriloquist's dummy and other puppets. He captures Pinocchio in order to use him as the main attraction in his puppet show, thus warning him it will violate a contract he had him sign to perform in every show he holds. When Pinocchio runs away from the show and goes to Pleasure Island, Stromboli sets out to recapture him as well as Geppetto. When Geppetto and Stromboli arrives at Pleasure Island, they were both looking for Pinocchio, only for Stromboli to get kicked out of Pleasure Island while Geppetto learns that the rollercoaster has the dark magic that will turn boys into donkeys, as was the case with Pinocchio when Geppetto tries to save him from getting into the rollercoaster, but to no avail. When Pinocchio and Geppetto come home to the toy shop after escaping the whale, Stromboli shows them the contract and wants Pinocchio back with him. Geppetto offers his whole shop in exchange. When the Blue Fairy refuses to help Geppetto save Pinocchio, Geppetto pleads and begs to give him one last chance. The Blue Fairy turns him into a real boy and frightens Stromboli away with her magic. * Mangiafuoco appears in the 2002 Pinocchio film portrayed by Franco Javarone while his English dub voice was provided by Kevin James. * In the 2007 film Shrek the Third, a Puppet Master (voiced by Chris Miller) similar to Mangiafuoco appears who refers to Pinocchio as his \\"star puppet\\" and is a villainous character like Disney's Stromboli. As Prince Charming rouses the band of villains at the Poison Apple tavern to join him in order to take over Far Far Away so he can become king, he says to the Puppet Master that \\"Your star puppet abandons the show to go and find his father\\". His only line is \\"I hate that little wooden puppet\\". ** Though he is not seen, his name is used in the title of the Shrek the Third video-game level \\"Stromboli's Workshop.\\" A picture of himself could also be seen in the video game level. * Mangiafuoco appears in the 2008 Pinocchio miniseries, portrayed by Maurizio Donadoni. * He appears in the 2012 Pinocchio film, voiced by Rocco Papaleo in the Italian version and by Vlasta Vr√°na in the English dub. *In the live-action Italian film Pinocchio (2019), co-written, directed and co-produced by Matteo Garrone, Mangiafuoco is portrayed by Gigi Proietti. * Mangiafuoco is set to be voiced by Ron Perlman in the 2021 stop-motion Netflix film Pinocchio, produced, written and directed by Guillermo del Toro.

Writing solely in the Yoruba language, he captivated the symbolic spirit of Yoruba mythologies in his plays, which were later adapted to other media such as photography, television and cinema. His most famous play, ·ªåba k√≤ so (The King did not Hang), a dramatization of the traditional Yoruba story of how ·π¢ango became the Orisha of Thunder, received international acclaim at the first Commonwealth Arts Festival in 1965 and on a European tour, where a Berlin critic, Ulli Beier, compared Ladip·ªç to Karajan.Ulli Beier, p.c. (1965) to Prof. Herbert F. W. Stahlke. Ladipo usually acted in his own plays. Early life Durodola Durosomo (or Durosinmi) Duroorike Timothy Adisa Ladipo was born on December 18, 1926 to Joseph Oni Ladipo and Dorcas Towobola Ajike Ladipo. Many sources claim he was born in 1931, but this was most likely erroneously stated. Because Ladipo was born after nine of his parent's children died before the age of 1, Ladipo was believed to an abiku. Abiku, meaning born to die, is a Yoruba concept in which there are spirits that possess the body's of several children of a parent and exist to cause pain and sadness for the parents. The only way this could be solved were intense spritiual rituals made to tie the child down to this world or convince the evil spirit that its death would not bring sadness. This was why some children can be seen with unaffectionate names. Ladipo being believed to be an abiku can be seen by his many names beginning with d√∫r√≥, a Yoruba word meaning to stay, wait, or remain. His name D√∫r√≥d·ªçl√° means \\"wait for wealth,\\" trying to convince him to stay and enjoy life, D√∫r√≥·π£·ªçm·ªçÃÅ means \\"stay to be our child,\\" another variation, D√∫r√≥sinm√≠ means \\"stay to bury me,\\" and D√∫r√≥or√≠k·∫πÃÅ means \\"stay to see how much we will care for you.\\" Despite the fact that both Joseph & Dorcas Ladipo were devout Anglican Christians who rejected the beliefs of their parents, they were so troubled by this that for Ladipo, they went to a traditional Ifa priest, or Babalawo. After Duro survived infancy, his parents had 5 more children, including a set of twins, who all survived infancy. Ladipo's great-grandfather was a drummer of the gangan (drum) & worshipper of the god Shango who escaped the Jalumi War with the help of Oderinlo, one of the war generals, because it was believed to be forbidden to kill a drummer in war. The tradition of drumming and drummaking continued with his son, Ladipo's grandfather. However, Ladipo's father, Joseph Oni, refused to follow his ancestor's footsteps and instead converted to Christianity around 1912, and became a minister at an Anglican church in O·π£ogbo. Joseph wanted Ladipo to follow in his footsteps to be a preacher, however, Ladipo was influenced by his grandfather, who was also a devout worshipper of Shango & Oya and was well versed in Yoruba mythology, especially those emanating from Old ·ªåy·ªç, and Ladipo observed Ifa and Egungun festivals at Ila Orangun & Otan Ayegbaju, towns near Osogbo. Career Ladip·ªç tried hard and succeeded in exposing himself to traditional and Yoruba cultural elements, especially when living under the veil of a Christian home. At a young age, he would sneak out of the vicarage to watch Yoruba festivals. This fascination with his culture goaded him into researching and experimenting with theatrical drama and writing. After leaving O·π£ogbo, he went to Ibadan, where he became a teacher. While in Ibadan he became one of the founding members of an artist club called Mbari Mbayo and became influenced by Beier. He later replicated the club in O·π£ogbo, and it became the premier group for promoting budding artists and dramatists in O·π£ogbo. Throughout his career, Duro Ladip·ªç wrote ten Yoruba folk operas combining dance, music, mime, proverbs, drumming and praise songs. Ladipo started his personal theatre group in 1961, but he became fully established with the founding of the Mbari Mbayo Club in O·π£ogbo. His popularity as the leader of a folk opera group rests on his three plays: ·ªåbamoro in 1962, ·ªåba ko so and ·ªåba Waja in 1964. (·ªåba Waja - \\"The King is Dead\\" - is based on the same historical event that inspired fellow Nigerian playwright W·ªçle ·π¢oyinka's Death and the King's Horseman.) He also promoted M·ªçremi, a play about the Yoruba ancestress of the same name. He later transformed Mbari Mbayo into a cultural center, an arts gallery and a meeting point for young artists seeking to develop their talents. Duro Ladip·ªç wrote quite a number of plays, such as Suru Baba Iwa\\" and \\"Tanimowo Iku.\\" Some of his plays were also produced for television. In fact, he created Bode Wasinimi for the Nigerian Television Authority, Ibadan. In 1977, Duro Ladipo participated in FESTAC '77, the Second World Festival of Black and African Arts and Culture, in Lagos, Nigeria. Personal life Despite his Christian backgrounds, Ladipo was a polygamist and had 3 wives, and about 15 children. In 1964, he married Abiodun Duro- Ladipo, his third wife and she became a permanent member of the troupe, she gained fame as an actress, taking main roles in all the plays performed by the company. He died on March 11, 1978, at the age of 51, from a short illness. It is said that when he died the heavens opened, and there was sudden rain & thunder and Shango, the god of thunder and the main character of his most famous work, welcomed him into the heavens.

The attractions include dark attractions, haunted houses, and a haunted hayride. It is referred to by the management of Shocktoberfest as a \\"haunted theme park\\" even though it is not a theme park in the true sense of the term. The attraction opened in 1991 at Willow Glen Park and has become a holiday destination for teenagers and families throughout the Mid-Atlantic states during the Halloween season. Over the years, it has grown from a single hayride into thirteen attractions and a number of special events on weekends over a two month period.  History  The site of the attraction is situated adjacent to Route 422, outside Reading, Pennsylvania, buffered by a creek, Norfolk Southern railroad tracks, and a housing development. Early land records show a much larger parcel than what is now called Willow Glen Park. Some of the land became Graffius Burial Vault Company and other pieces became part of the housing development. According to Shocktoberfest's marketing, the land has a supposedly troubled past. They say that the land was home to a state psychiatric hospital, a state penitentiary, and a chemical processing plant. This information has proved to be a marketing ploy, as the land was never used for any of these purposes. However, claims of the Graffius Burial Vault Company being a short walk away are true, although it is not a part of Shocktoberfest. The attraction began in 1991 as a haunted hayride called Maniac Mountain. A haunted house was added in 1997, and the name was changed to Shocktoberfest. Beginning in 2000, a period of expansion began, with improvements to the two existing attractions, as well as the addition of a new haunt in 2004, The Prison of the Dead. In 2006, Shocktoberfest was selected as one of the Top 13 Haunted Attractions in the country by Haunt World Magazine. Attractions= Haunted Hayride  The hayride attraction has its route changed and is re-themed yearly. The BioHazard Hayride was the title and theme in 2009. The attraction was entitled Zombie Revenge Haunted Hayride in 2012. As of 2014, it was entitled the Zombie Safari Hayride.  The Prison of the Dead  A attraction which was built for the 2004 season. It is a two-level attraction, with portions both indoors and outdoors, themed as a prison. Guests begin their tour by boarding a prison bus. The tour of the actual maze is approximately a 30 minute walk, and sometimes, crawl. This is thought to be the premier attraction on the site, and its primary haunted house.  The Monster Midway  The Monster Midway located at the entrance of the park. This is set up in a carnival fashion where there will be food, classic side shows, and games. The Midway used to feature carnival rides for a few years, however they have been removed since 2004. Ticket purchasing can also be found here. And also the entrances for The Prison of the Dead and the BioHazard Hayride can be found towards the end of the Midway. Ground Assault: Zombie Laser Tag A laser tag experience that allows customers to shoot both each other and zombies, launched in 2016. The Unknown 2.0 This is Shocktoberfest's secondary haunted house. Although smaller than the Prison of the Dead house, it is said to be equally intense. In addition to its regular use, the Almost Naked and Scared Challenge (below) is held here once per evening, on Friday and Saturday only. The Almost Naked and Scared Challenge The Naked and Scared Challenge is an adults-only experience. Visitors at least 18 years old are invited to disrobe before entering the attraction. After choosing the \\"nude\\" or \\"prude\\" (underwear-only) option, guests are asked to sign waivers prior to a clothes-free fright. The nude option was cancelled prior to opening, due to pressure from local authorities. This event began during the 2013 season, and is still running as of 2017 as the Almost Naked and Scared Challenge.

Frye founded Standard Air Lines which eventually took him into a merger with Trans World Airlines (TWA) where he became president. Frye is credited for turning TWA into a world-class airline during his tenure as president from 1934 to 1947.  Early life  Frye was born in Sweetwater, Oklahoma on March 18, 1904 to cattle ranchers William and Nellie Frye. He had a younger brother, Donald, and a younger sister, Ople. After his mother Nellie's death in 1912, the family moved to Wheeler, Texas to live with grandparents. Frye enlisted in the United States Army Corps of Engineers in 1921, and was discharged as a corporal in 1922. In 1922, Frye left for California with his brother Don. Aviation career Frye began flying lessons in 1923 with instructor Burdett Fuller at Burdett Field in Los Angeles. Frye joined Fuller in the \\"13 Black Cats\\", an aviation stunt team for the movie industry. Frye became good friends with two student pilots at Fuller's, Walter Hamilton and Paul E. Richter. Frye, Hamilton, and Richter pooled their money together and formed Aero Corporation of California in 1925. They bought out Fuller's flight school and did everything from flight instruction, banner towing, charter flights and crop dusting. Hamilton, who had been a mechanic for the Duesenberg Motors Company, ran their aircraft maintenance operation. Frye held Tranport Pilot Certificate #933 and Richter held Transport Pilot Certificate #501. In 1926, Los Angeles aerial police ticketed Frye for flying less than 1,000 feet above the city.New York Times, 16 Aug. 1926. Frye, Richter, and Hamilton's new goal was to enter the scheduled airline business, so on February 3, 1926, Standard Air Lines was formed as a subsidiary of Aero Corp. Standard Air Lines initially flew single engine Fokker F-7 aircraft from Los Angeles to Tucson with a stop in Phoenix. Within a year, they extended their route to El Paso. In 1929, Standard purchased Fokker F-10A aircraft. Frye and Richter took one of their stock tri- motors and set a commercial aircraft altitude record of 22,680ft. Western Air Express bought controlling interest of Aero Corp in early 1930, but still operated Standard as a separate airline. When Western Air Express merged with Transcontinental Air Transport (TAT) in July 1930 to form Transcontinental and Western Air (T&WA;), the government forced Western to sell Standard to American Airlines as part of the deal due to its southern route into Texas. However, Frye elected to stay with T&WA; and was made Vice President of Operations, Richter became Vice President of Western Division, and Hamilton became Maintenance Superintendent. After the reorganization caused by the Air Mail Scandal of 1934, Frye became president of T&WA; in 1934. T&WA; eventually became Trans World Airlines (TWA) and was known as \\"The Airline Run by Flyers\\". The airline suffered near disaster after its reputation was hurt in 1931 when Notre Dame coach Knute Rockne died on a T&WA; Fokker F-10 tri-motor airplane. In 1932 Jack Frye, representing T&WA;, sought a better aircraft and in response to this and other requests, Douglas Aircraft Company developed the Douglas DC-1 Transport twin. In February 1934, Jack Frye and Eddie Rickenbacker, President of Eastern Airlines, set a transcontinental record of 13 hours and 4 minutes flying the Douglas DC-1 in a publicity stunt for the new airliner. In May 1934, Frye broke his record by flying a Northrop Gamma from Los Angeles to Newark in an elapsed time of 11 hours and 31 minutes. In 1937, Frye and Richter founded \\"Conquistadors del Cielo\\" (Conquerers of the Sky), an annual gathering of top airline executives at a dude ranch in Wyoming. In 1939, desiring greater control of their airline, Frye and Richter approached industrialist and film producer Howard Hughes to buy into the company. (Jack Frye stated in an April 6, 1954 issue of Life magazine that it was Hughes who approached him in regard to investments.) Hughes' interest was airplanes, and his initial involvement was the development and financing of the Lockheed Constellation for TWA. On April 17,1944, Frye set his third transcontinental record when he and Hughes flew the Constellation prototype on a record 6 hour 58 minute flight from Los Angeles to Washington D.C. Marriage Frye married Debbie Greer in Tijuana, Mexico in 1924, they divorced in 1932. In 1932, Frye married Regine (Jean) LaCoste in Ravena, Missouri, they divorced in 1939. In January 1941, he married Helen Varner Vanderbilt who was previously married to Cornelius Vanderbilt IV.Frye and Helen divorced in January 1950. In July 1950, Frye married his fourth wife in Hollywood, FL, New York showgirl and actress Emily Nevada Smith. They had a daughter in 1953, Lili Nevajac Frye. Later life After a dispute with Hughes in 1946, Frye resigned as president of TWA on February 21, 1947.New York Times, 22 Feb. 1947: Frye explains resignation. Frye was very well connected in Washington D.C., and soon landed a coveted prize as director of one of the German corporations seized during World War II, in this case the U.S. residual of IG Farben. On April 14, 1947, he was elected Chairman of the Board of General Aniline and Film Corp, and its subsidiaries General Dyestuffs Corporation, and Ansco. Frye remained President of General Aniline until 1955, when the Eisenhower administration unwound these holdings through the Office of Alien Property Custodian.Drew Pearson synd. column, Washington Merry-go- Round, 23 Feb. 1955. In 1955, Frye formed his own aircraft manufacturing company, the Frye Corporation. In December 1956, Grumman Aircraft agreed to produce the Frye Safari, a four-engine, Short Takeoff & Landing (STOL) airlifter,\\"Safari\\" Flight 6 July 1956 if Frye could find financing. Ernst Zindel, who designed the Junkers Ju 52, was retained as an assistant. However, the project was cancelled.New York Times, 15 Jan. 1957: Grumman and Frye agree on new plane; NYT, 2 Oct. 1955: Aviation: A Slow Plane; NYT, 15 Sep. 1955: DC-3 Like Plane outlined by Frye. Death and honors On February 3, 1959, while driving home after work in Tucson, Arizona, Fyre was killed in a car accident by a drunk driver.

History  On November 10, 1869 students accepted ownership of the Dalhousie Gazette from the founding editors. A referendum was held February 18‚Äì19, 1960, regarding the question of a Student Union Building being built on campus. 90.2% of voters backed the idea. 83.2% of students turned out to vote. On November 8, 1968, the Student Union Building was opened. The cost of the building eventually was $3,700,000. The construction of the building was made possible in part by the province of Nova Scotia, which granted a loan of $2,766,600 to the Student Union. The SUB loan was retired in 1982. The CRTC approved student-operated campus radio station CKDU's application for an FM broadcasting license in October 1984. The station's first broadcast was Friday, February 1, 1985, at 3:30 p.m. The Dalhousie Student Union was a founding member of the Canadian Federation of Students in 1981 but withdrew its membership in 1994. In that same year, it became a founding member of the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations. Student Union Building In 2003 the DSU helped found the Alliance of Nova Scotia Student Associations, later named Students Nova Scotia, Nova Scotia's provincial student advocacy group. On February 27, 2015, the DSU council voted on and subsequently passed a motion to remove its membership from Students Nova Scotia.  Structure  The DSU is run by a Council consisting of members elected by either the student body directly in open elections, or appointed by certain student societies. The Council meets every two weeks during the school year, and monthly during the summer. The Council has the ability to approve budgets and expenditures on behalf of the student body. Day-to-day operations of the DSU are managed by the Executive, which is headed by the DSU President. The Executive has the ability to execute its functions and spend its budget as approved by Council, but any new programs or substantial changes must first be approved by Council. The DSU also represents students on the Dalhousie Board of Governors and Senate, and to external organizations. The DSU is granted seven seats on the Senate and three on the Board of Governors. Traditionally, one member of the executive will fill one of these seats and the remainder are filled by students chosen during an election. Students sitting on the Board of Governors or Senate also hold a seat on the DSU Council. DSU elections are held annually, usually in the first week of March. They are preceded by a week of campaigning by the candidates. In the 2007 general election, the voter turnout rate was 21%. The union also employs full-time staff to manage the Student Union Building, the Grawood campus bar, research, communications and reservations for building facilities. All full-time staff are managed by the student union executive.

Designed by Arthur Peabody, it was completed in 1914. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 for its architectural significance in Adams County. By the early 1900s, Adams County's previous courthouse in Friendship needed replacement, and in 1912 the County Board approved architectural plans for a new courthouse. At the time though, there was a rivalry between the villages of Friendship and nearby Adams. In a 1913 vote on the $30,000 bond to build the courthouse, Friendship voted overwhelmingly for, and Adams overwhelmingly against. The total support was sufficient and the project went ahead. In 1913, the old wooden courthouse was torn down and replaced with the current brick courthouse. George Kieke was the chief construction engineer. Arthur Peabody, the UW's supervising architect at the time, designed the modest building in the Neoclassical style that somewhat recalls a Roman or Greek temple, with four colossal pilasters supporting an entablature inscribed Adams County. One hundred years later, the courthouse is still used for public offices, and is still a central landmark in the village of Friendship.

It is located about one mile south-west of Long Stratton and south west of Norwich. It covers an area of and has a population of 302 people as of the last census in 2011 One of Wacton's most prominent features is All Saints round tower church. History In John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales 1870‚Äì72, Wacton, Norfolk (which at the time was two parishes) was described as: \\"WACTON-MAGNA and W.-Parva, two parishes in Depwade district, Norfolk; 1 mile ESE of Forcett r. station, and 1¬Ω SW of Long Stratton-Post town, Long Stratton.

The church was recently restored.\\" A graph showing the occupations of Wactons residents in 1881. As you can see in the above graph, there was a far narrower range of occupations for Wacton's residents in 1881 in comparison to 2011. The vast majority of working Males in village worked in 'Agriculture' (37), the other occupations had a very low number of men occupied the next most frequent occupations were 'House, Furniture & Decoration' (3) and 'Professionals' (also 3). A large percentage of the females had 'No Specified Occupation' (37) whilst a further 19 had an 'Unknown' occupation. After these two categories, the next most frequent occupation was work in 'Domestic Services & Offices' Despite Wacton's relative insignificance being amongst hundreds of small villages in the country, it actually has history dating back to thousands of years. The earliest known presence of people in the parish is known to be as far back as prehistoric times. Evidence was discovered during fieldwalks in 1978‚Äì80 when boiling pots and flints were found amongst other records from other historic periods. There was little records of the preceding Bronze and Iron Ages been significant in the parish, the only records being flint tools in the early part of the Bronze Age and socketed spearheads in the latter half. For the Iron Age the only records found were silver coins and pottery sherds. There was a strong Roman period presence in Wacton too. A major road called Pye Road used to run through the village from Scole and a Roman town named Venta Icenorum at Caistor St Edmund. The finest artefacts discovered from the Roman include gold coin which was discovered in a garden in Wash Lane in 1998. Evidence suggests Barbarous radiate coins were likely manufactured in the south side of Wacton too. There is a gap in history in Wacton with there being very few and far between finds from the Saxon period. However, the following Medieval period was the richest historical period for Wacton. It was the period in which the still standing All Saints Church was erected along with St. Mary's Church which no longer stands. St Mary's church later became a chapel in 1500 but was followed by a period of disuse between 1510 and 1522 before being used as a devecote. Other less significant artefacts from the Medieval period include a cowbell found in 1979, a coin weight and a silver strap fittling. In more recent history, The Eastern Union Railway used to run through Wacton to London from the mid 19th century to its closure in 1966. There was not a station in Wacton, but villagers could catch the train at the nearby Forncett.  All Saints Church  The round-tower church is Wacton's most prominent and recognisable landmark. The structure has two main segments, the tower and main body. The lower stage of the tower may be Saxon. The church is thought to have been built in the 12th century, with alterations made in the following centuries such as door and window replacement All Saints Church, along with numerous other buildings in Wacton, has protected status  Wacton Village Hall  Wacton Village Hall is a relatively new feature to Wacton. The Hall only fully opened to the village's residents in 2013 after many years of fundraising and a six-year building programme. The facilities are open for community events as well as public and private hire. The running of the Hall requires volunteers wherever possible. Before the current village hall there was another, built in the 1950s. However, by the 1990s it was severely worn out and required a replacement ‚Äì hence the new one. Users of the previous hall mused that one would have to wear woolly hats and gloves in doors as well as bring an umbrella such was the state of the halls waterworks and heating. It was finally announced in 1997 that a new planning application had been sent for a new building. However, it actually took a further 16 years for the hall to be fully open for use for everyone. It was bullt after ¬£200,000 was eventually raised by local residents. Facilities: The main hall ‚Äì relatively large, 15m x 5.5m, holding a capacity of 120 standing, 80 seated.

There has been growth in between 1801 and 2011, however it has been quite conservative with the initial population being 241, with the population being 302 as of 2011. However the vast majority of this growth has been between 1961 and 2001 where the population grew from 172 to 319. Before 1961, despite occasional peaks in growth, the population was in gradual decline. Since 2001 the population has shrunk very slightly to 302 (2001), however its to early to say whether this is going to be a trend for decades to come, or whether it is simply another trough before a peak in growth. The current population of Wacton is a relatively old one ‚Äì 59.3% of Wacton's residents are over 45 years of age.

It was originally established in 1881 to aid Jewish refugees. In 1975, the State Department asked HIAS to aid in resettling 3,600 Vietnam refugees. Since that time, the organization continues to provide support for refugees of all nationalities, religions, and ethnic origins. The organization works with people whose lives and freedom are believed to be at risk due to war, persecution, or violence. HIAS has offices in the United States and across Latin America, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. Since its inception, HIAS has helped resettle more than 4.5 million people.  Name  According to HIAS, the acronym HIAS was first used as a telegraphic address and eventually became the universally used name of the organization. A 1909 merger with the Hebrew Sheltering Aid Society resulted in the official name Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society, but the organization continued to be generally known as \\"H.I.A.S.\\" or more usually as \\"HIAS\\", which eventually became the official name.  History  HIAS was founded in 1881 in response to the late 19th- and early 20th-century exodus of Jewish emigrants from Imperial Russia. It merged with the Hebrew Sheltering House Association, founded in New York the same year. Lawrence J. Epstein writes that the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society was founded in 1904;y. \\"HEAS Agents were notorious in their mistreatment of immigrants at Castle Garden. The group ‚Äî not to be confused with HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society ‚Äî ceased functioning in 1884. The work of HEAS was taken over by United Hebrew Charities ...\\" several other sources give a date of 1902.\\"The Jewish Migration Problem: How It Has Been Met, by Albert Rosenblatt, Vice President, Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), 1924,\\" reproduced in Jacob Rader Marcus, The Jew in the American World: A Source Book (1996), Wayne State University Press, . p. 371. in The Baltimore Sun mentioned the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society in an article published in 1882.\\"Alleged Clubbing of Immigrants: Was This a Police Outrage\\". The Baltimore Sun. June 14, 1882. p. 1. \\"The New York Herald states that two Russian Hebrew immigrants were subjected to very severe usage by a policeman in that city Monday, their offense consisting in having complained of ill treatment by the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society when asked for assistance. It is stated, on the authority of an eye witness, that a policeman became angry because of a request from one of the immigrants to be allowed to go into an office of the society in a basement, and dealt the immigrant a powerful blow with a club, the blood spurting from a terrible gash and pouring in streams over his face and neck.\\" HIAS reported its date of formation as 1881 on its annual return with the Internal Revenue Service. In 1904, HIAS established a formal bureau on Ellis Island, the primary arrival point of European immigrants to the United States at that time. A contemporary reference to the group. In March 1909, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society merged with the Hebrew Sheltering House Association to form the Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society, which continued to be widely known as HIAS. By 1914, HIAS had branches in Baltimore, Philadelphia, Correspondence addressed to Levy in Philadelphia \\"as President of the Association for the Protection of Jewish Immigrants (currently known as HIAS Pennsylvania).\\" Boston, and an office in Washington, D.C. In 1891, Jewish residents of Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Kyiv were expelled and many came to America; beginning in 1892, Ellis Island was the point of entry for most of these new arrivals. In the half-century following the establishment of a formal Ellis Island bureau in 1904, HIAS helped more than 100,000 Jewish immigrants who might otherwise have been turned away. They provided translation services, guided immigrants through medical screening and other procedures, argued before the Boards of Special Enquiry to prevent deportations, lent needy Jews the $25 landing fee, and obtained bonds for others guaranteeing their employable status. The Society was active on the island facilitating legal entry, reception, and immediate care for the newly arrived. HIAS also searched for relatives of detained immigrants in order to secure the necessary affidavits of support to guarantee that the new arrivals would not become public charges. Lack of such affidavits and/or material means impacted a large number of immigrants: of the 900 immigrants detained during one month in 1917, 600 were held because they had neither money nor friends to claim them. Through advertising and other methods, the society was able to locate relatives for the vast majority of detainees, who in a short time were released from Ellis Island. Many of the Jews traveling in steerage on the steamship lines across the Atlantic refused the non-kosher food served on their journeys and arrived at Ellis Island malnourished and vulnerable to deportation on medical grounds. In 1911, the Society installed a kosher kitchen on the Island. Between 1925 and 1952, HIAS' kosher kitchen provided more than a half million meals to immigrants; in the peak year, 1940, 85,794 meals were served. The Society also provided religious services and musical concerts at Ellis Island. It ran an employment bureau and sold railroad tickets at reduced rates to immigrants headed for other cities. In the summer of 1911, HIAS set up an Oriental Department to meet the growing needs of immigrants from the Balkans and Near East, who began arriving in the U.S. in considerable numbers. Between 1908 and 1913, approximately 10,000 Jewish emigrants left the Middle East for the U.S. During this period, resettlement of Jewish immigrants included assistance in obtaining U.S. citizenship. For this a rudimentary knowledge of English and familiarity with American institutions were mandatory. In addition to classes given at its own building, HIAS arranged educational courses for the immigrants through a network of local Jewish organizations. From 1909 to 1913, HIAS helped more than 35,000 new immigrants become naturalized citizens.  World War I  The outbreak of World War I in 1914 brought the largest influx of Jews from Eastern Europe to date: 138,051 in that year alone.\\"Table XII: Number of Jewish Immigrants and Total Number of Immigrants Admitted to the United States, 1899‚Äì1920,\\" American Jewish year book, Volume 23 (1921), American Jewish Committee, Jewish Publication Society of America. p. 294. However, when the North Atlantic became a battle zone and German submarines seriously impaired overseas passenger traffic, immigration numbers plunged. The war made it increasingly difficult for American-based families to maintain contact with their scattered family members behind enemy lines. To address this, HIAS sent one of its operatives to Europe to establish communications. He succeeded in securing permission from the German and Austro-Hungarian High Command for residents of the military zones to write short messages to their families to be distributed by HIAS in New York. HIAS also accepted and delivered messages sent by the zone's non-Jewish population. By war's end, HIAS had transmitted a total of 300,000 communications on behalf of separated families. The Russian Revolution of 1917 ‚Äì and the following civil war, famine, and pogroms that left about 50,000 Jews dead ‚Äì created another surge of emigration from the former Russian Empire. HIAS continued to help these immigrants find safe haven despite growing anti-immigration sentiments in the U.S. In 1918 HIAS sent a representative, Samuel Mason, on a mission to Japan, Manchuria and Vladivostok on behalf of thousands of European immigrants stranded in the Far East by the World War and the Russian Revolution. He established HIAS offices and international post offices and succeeded in helping both Jews and non-Jews on their journeys to new homes in the USA and other countries. He also established The Central Information Bureau for Jewish War Sufferers in the Far East which worked with HIAS to help Jewish refugees in Shanghai through the end of World War II. Between the years 1909 and 1919, HIAS registered 482,742 immigrants arriving in the U.S. HIAS' Ellis Island Bureau interceded with 28,884 held for special inquiry, of whom 22,780 were admitted based on second hearings, with only 6,104 deported. During this period HIAS facilitated the naturalization of 64,298 immigrants.  Between the wars  HIAS Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, 1925 The dislocation and turmoil following World War I led to acts of anti-Semitism throughout the former war zone, especially in Poland, Romania, Russia, and Hungary. While other Jewish agencies, most notably the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (\\"The Joint\\"), supplied Jews in the affected countries with food, clothing, and medical supplies, HIAS created a worldwide network of Jewish organizations to provide assistance in immigration to the U.S., Canada, South America, Australia, and China. The establishment of HICEM in 1927 proved critical to the later rescue operation that saved thousands of Jewish lives during World War II. HICEM resulted from the merger of three Jewish migration associations: New York- based HIAS (Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society); Jewish Colonization Association (JCA), which was based in Paris but registered as a British charitable society; and Emigdirect (United Jewish Emigration Committee), a migration organization based in Berlin. HICEM is an acronym of these organizations' names. The agreement between the three organizations stipulated that all local branches outside the U.S. would merge into HICEM, while HIAS would still deal with Jewish immigration to the U.S. However, Emigdirect was forced to withdraw from the merger in 1934, and British wartime regulations later restricted the JCA from using its funds outside Britain. Thus, for a while, HICEM was funded exclusively by HIAS and could be considered as its European extension. In 1923, HIAS established the HIAS Immigrant Bank at 425 Lafayette Street in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan. The bank was licensed by the State of New York. Its sole purpose was to facilitate remittance or money transfers to and from immigrants‚Äô families abroad, which was then a service not offered by most U.S. banks.  World War II and the Holocaust  By the time World War II broke out in September 1939, HICEM had offices throughout Europe, South and Central America, and the Far East. Its employees advised and prepared European refugees for emigration, including helping them during their departure and arrival. HICEM's European headquarters were in Paris. After Germany invaded and conquered France in mid-1940, HICEM closed its Paris offices. On June 26, 1940, two days after France capitulation the main HIAS-HICEM Paris Office was authorized by Portuguese ruler Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar to be transferred from Paris to Lisbon. According to the Lisbon Jewish community, Salazar held Mois√©s Bensabat Amzalak, the leader of the Lisbon Jewish community in high esteem and that allowed Amazlak to play an important role in getting Salazar's permission to transfer from Paris to Lisbon the main HIAS European Office in June 1940. The French office reopened in October 1940, first in Bordeaux, for a week, and finally in Marseilles in the so-called \\"free zone\\" Vichy France. Until November 11, 1942, when the Germans occupied all of France, HICEM employees were at work in French internment camps, such as the infamous Gurs. HIAS looked for Jews who met U.S. State Department immigration requirements, and were ready to leave France. At the time of the German invasion of France, there were approximately 300,000 native and foreign Jews living in France; however, the State Department's policies curbing immigration meant that the number of applicants to America far exceeded the number allowed to leave. When all legal emigration of Jews from France ceased, HICEM began to operate clandestinely from the town of Brive la Gaillarde. It had an office in the upper level of the building of the Synagogue led by Rabbi David Feuerwerker, the Rabbi of Brive. Here a small group of HICEM employees ‚Äì establishing contact and cooperation with the local underground forces of the French resistance ‚Äì succeeded in smuggling Jews out of France to Spain and Switzerland. Twenty-one HICEM employees were deported and killed in the concentration camps; others were killed in direct combat with the Nazis. During this period, HICEM in France worked closely with HICEM in Lisbon. Lisbon, as a neutral port, was the path of choice for Jews escaping Europe to North and South America. Many of these fled from the Netherlands and Belgium and through France, or else started directly in France, and then were smuggled and climbed over the Pyrenees with \\"passeur\\" guides to Barcelona, and then by train through Madrid and finally to Lisbon. From Lisbon many refugee Jewish families sailed to America on the Serpa Pinto or its sister ship the Mouzinho. In the main, HICEM (HIAS) helped intact or semi-intact families to flee. But, often together with ≈íuvre de secours aux enfants (OSE) or with the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee\\" (\\"the Joint,\\" it also helped unaccompanied children to flee without their parents. At French concentration camps, such as the notorious Gurs, many of these children were officially allowed by the Nazis to leave but required to leave their parents in the camps. Those unaccompanied children who were forced to leave their parents behind, and who fled directly to the United States are part of the group known as the One Thousand Children (OTC) (which actually numbers about 1400). Nearly all the OTC parents were murdered by the Nazis. Other rescue organizations also moved their European offices to Lisbon at that time, including \\"the Joint\\" (the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee). They also included (the American Friends Service Committee (the Quakers) (see History of the Quakers). From 1940 onward, HICEM's activities were partly supported by the Joint. Despite friction between the two organizations, they worked together to provide refugees with tickets and information about visas and transportation, and helped them leave Lisbon on neutral Portuguese ships, mainly, as already stated above, the Serpa Pinto and the Mouzinho. In all, some 40,000 Jews managed to escape Europe during the Holocaust with HICEM's and the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (the Joint's or JDC's) assistance. HICEM was dissolved in 1945; HIAS continued its work in Europe under its own name.  Jewish displaced persons  In the wake of World War II, HIAS assumed its most massive job to date ‚Äì assisting with the emigration needs of the approximately 300,000 Jewish displaced persons throughout the former war zone. Nearly every surviving Jewish family in Central and Eastern Europe had been separated, with parents and children scattered throughout many countries. Reuniting them so they could emigrate as a unit was one of the primary tasks for HIAS workers in the field. Obtaining documents required for emigration was difficult as throughout the war people had fled from one place to another, escaped from concentration camps to hide in villages and forests, then reappeared under assumed names. Identity papers were destroyed; false papers, fabricated papers, or, most often, no papers at all, were common. HIAS operations set up for DP work in Germany and Austria at the end of 1945 were the largest in the history of the organization in any one country, and they kept growing with the flood of refugees streaming out of Poland and Romania. HIAS offices functioned in Hoechst, Frankfurt, Munich, Foehrenwald, Stuttgart, Berlin, Bremen, Hanover, Regensburg, Baden-Baden, Vienna, Linz, and Salzburg, with HIAS representatives stationed in the camps themselves. Besides Germany, HIAS worked in France, Italy, and Eastern European countries such as Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria. HIAS functioned in Shanghai until 1950, helping refugees who had escaped eastward from Nazi-occupied Europe to immigrate to Australia, the Americas, and Europe. From 1945 to 1951, HIAS sponsored and assisted a total 167,450 emigrants: 79,675 of these immigrated to the U.S.; 24,049 to the British Commonwealth; 24,806 to Latin America; and 38,920 to Israel and other countries.  Evacuation of Jews from Muslim countries; Hungary; Cuba; Czechoslovakia; Poland; Ethiopia  Since 1950, HIAS' activities have closely mirrored world events. In 1956, HIAS helped relocate Jews fleeing the Soviet invasion of Hungary, and evacuated the Jewish community of Egypt after their expulsion during the Sinai Campaign. During the Cuban Revolution, HIAS set up operations in Miami to relocate the Jews of Cuba. During the 1960s, HIAS rescued Jews from Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya and arranged with Morocco's King Hassan for the evacuation of his country's huge Jewish community to France and, eventually, Israel. Of almost one million Jewish refugees from Muslim countries, about 80,000 were resettled by HIAS. In 1965, HIAS was instrumental in the passage of an immigration law that finally replaced the National Origins Quota, eliminating decades of ethnic admission policies for the US. In 1968, HIAS came to the aid of Czechoslovakia's Jews after the suppression of the \\"Prague Spring,\\" and to Poland's Jews after Communist Party factions started an internal fight using an anti-intellectual and anti-Semitic campaign, whose real goal was to weaken the pro-reform liberal party faction and attack other circles (1968 Polish political crisis). In 1975, following the fall of Saigon, HIAS was asked by the State Dept to aid in resettling 3600 Vietnam refugees. It was at that time that HIAS broadened its mission, Since that time, the organization has continued to provide support for refugees of all nationalities, religions, and ethnic origins. This has been stated as: \\"Originally HIAS helped Jewish refugees; now HIAS is Jews helping all refugees.\\" In 1977, HIAS helped evacuate the Jews of Ethiopia, which culminated in several airlifts to Israel. However, in 1981, the Jewish Defense League protested the \\"lack of action\\" to rescue Ethiopian Jews by taking over the main offices of HIAS in Manhattan. In close coordination with Israel, HIAS played a central role in rescuing Jews from Syria and Lebanon. In 1979, the overthrow of the Shah in Iran precipitated a slow but steady stream of Jews escaping the theocracy of that country, home to one of the world's oldest Jewish communities. In Addition, to helping Iranian Jew's, many Iranians for religious e.g. Bahia faith or political reason's were also aided by HIAS.  The Soviet Jewry exodus  Beginning in the mid-1960s, HIAS returned to the work initiated at its founding ‚Äì assisting immigrants escaping Russia with their arrival and resettlement needs in the U.S. Close to a century later, a new Jewish exodus from the previous Russian Empire ‚Äì now the USSR ‚Äì started with a trickle of departures. Throughout the entire era of Soviet Jewish exodus, HIAS' operations centered around two beliefs: 1) Israel is the homeland for the Jewish people and 2) emigrants have the right to live together with extended family in their country of choice. On December 3, 1966, Premier Alexei Kosygin said in Paris that \\"if there are some families divided by the war who want to meet their relatives outside of the USSR, or even to leave the USSR, we shall do all in our power to help them, and there is no problem.\\" In stark contrast to the premier's words, the Soviet authorities did everything in their power to prevent Jews from leaving the country, implementing anti-Semitic, anti- emigration campaigns that included harassment, economic pressure, and an increasingly bureaucratic visa-application process. These methods deterred many would-be applicants, who abandoned the process once their initial applications were denied. During the early years of exodus, the number of departures depended largely on the status of the United States-Soviet relationship and on financial pragmatism. In hopes of achieving economic benefits from the US, the Soviet government sporadically opened its emigration gates, sometimes even in contradiction of its own legislation. Thus, despite the \\"Diploma Tax\\" that was instituted in December 1972 and required exiting Jews to pay for the higher education they received in the USSR, the government allowed two groups of 900 persons each to leave shortly thereafter without paying. By March 1973, the tax was revoked in the face of extreme pressure from the international public community and the Soviets' fear of not being awarded Most Favored Nation status by the U.S. In December 1973, the Jackson- Vanik Amendment, which linked trade agreements with the USSR to freedom of its citizens to emigrate, was passed in the U.S. Congress by a landslide. This legislation was an indicator of the degree to which the Soviet Jewry struggle had won the moral support of the West and had spurred the American Jewish community into action. The Soviet authorities were now subject to criticism not only from scattered groups of dissidents and refuseniks, but from tens of thousands protesting in front of Soviet embassies and consulates around the globe. Over time, these combined factors impacted the numbers of the Jews leaving the Soviet Union. HIAS was involved from the beginning of the Jewish exodus from the USSR. In December 1966, HIAS organized a campaign to encourage American Jews to invite their Soviet relatives to join them in the U.S. The Soviet Union initially allowed limited exit visas to the U.S., though eventually, regardless of their final destination, Soviet Jews who received permission to emigrate were granted exit visas only to Israel. Early on, Vienna became the first stop for all Jews exiting the USSR. There they were greeted by a representative of the Jewish Agency for Israel (JAFI) and by HIAS, and were asked to determine their final destination. Those who were going to Israel were assisted by JAFI; those headed for the U.S. or elsewhere were processed by HIAS. After a short stay in Vienna, those destined for the U.S. were transferred to Rome, where they were processed by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). In August 1972, HIAS obtained U.S. parole status for hundreds of Russian refugees waiting in Rome, cutting their transit time from six months to six weeks. Parole made immigration possible without delay for all members of a family unit reunifying with their relatives in the U.S., who were formally considered their \\"sponsors.\\" In an effort to alleviate the financial burden on communities accepting increased numbers of Russian refugees, HIAS negotiated with the U.S. State Department a one-time $300 per-capita grant for Russians who emigrated from Europe to the U.S. after January 1974. HIAS passed along the full amount to each resettlement agency. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the years of perestroika and glasnost, the political face of the Soviet Union changed, as well as the course of Jewish history. Jews were now free to assemble, to worship ‚Äì and to leave the country. But as the number of emigrants swelled in Rome, significant backlogs developed and the time between arrival in Rome and the HIAS interview grew to three weeks. By the summer of 1989 overall processing time took 70‚Äì80 days. This situation was further aggravated by the denial of refugee status by the INS for an increasing number of Soviet Jewish applicants. In Washington, then-Attorney General Richard Thornburgh announced a new policy of unilateral review of all previously denied cases, using \\"the most generous standards for that review.\\" The effect was immediate: INS began its review of the denied caseload in October, resulting in the overturning of more than 95 percent of the previous denials. As a result, the percentage of denials dropped from 40 to 2, eliminating the backlog. Parallel activity was taking place in Congress, as this issue was brought to members' attention by HIAS and the Council of Jewish Federations (the precursor to the United Jewish Communities). In November 1989, President George H.W. Bush signed into law the Morrison-Lautenberg Amendment, which established that a member of a category group \\"may establish a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion [‚Ä¶] by asserting a credible basis for concern about the possibility of such persecution.\\" This amendment, which has been renewed a number of times, is still in force today and greatly facilitates processing for refugees from the FSU, Indochina, and Iran. In late September 1989, the State Department announced a major change in processing refugee admission for Soviet applicants. With a decreasingly hostile environment inside the USSR, the U.S. instituted a system that allowed Soviet Jews to apply and remain in country while waiting for notification of status. From autumn 1989, those seeking family reunification in the U.S. applied for immigration processing at the U.S. Consulate in Moscow. In 1994, HIAS opened an office in Moscow and, in 2003, one in Kyiv. Today, these offices closely monitor conditions in the former Soviet Union (FSU) and assist refugees bound for resettlement in the U.S. and other countries. Overall, during the 40 years of Soviet Jewish emigration, HIAS assisted more than 400,000 Soviet Jews to immigrate to the U.S. Among the recipients of HIAS aid was Sergey Brin, who at the age of six immigrated to the United States from the Soviet Union with his family, and later became the multi-billionaire co-founder of Google. Brin later became a benefactor of HIAS, joining its board and donating $1 million to the group.Stephanie Stromoct, Billionaire Aids Charity That Aided Him, New York Times (October 24, 2009).  HIAS today  HIAS makes reference to Jewish tradition, values, and texts that call on Jews to help the stranger and to \\"repair the world\\" (tikkun olam, in Hebrew). Thus, since 1975, and even more so since 2000, HIAS as a matter of policy has directed its resources to assist refugees and immigrants of all religions, ethnicities, nationalities, and backgrounds. It has helped many such refugees and immigrants to reunite with their families, and to resettle in the United States. In 2018, the very large majority of such refugees both recently and currently have been non-Jewish. HIAS also advocates in the United States Congress on policies affecting refugees and immigrants. HIAS has a presence in 18 countries across the globe. The organization's staff work with refugees living on the margins of foreign cities or in refugee camps. Depending on location, HIAS services can include trauma counseling, art therapy, legal representation, and humanitarian assistance, among others. Working with the U.S. government, the government of Israel, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and a host of non- governmental organizations, HIAS assists refugees with U.S. resettlement and follows through with immigrant integration and citizenship programs. In 1968, HIAS sold HIAS Immigrant Bank to what is known today as IDB Bank, which operated the acquisition as Israel Discount Trust Company, a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. As of 2017, HIAS operates in the following places. In the United States, HIAS helps resettle refugees from around the world through a national affiliate network of Jewish agencies. It coordinates resettlement services, provides extensive integration and citizenship programs for Russian speaking refugees and immigrants, and gives scholarships to refugees. HIAS also advocates for immigration laws with a network of Jewish, interfaith, and other partners in Washington, DC and nationwide. Additionally, HIAS promotes educational initiatives that encourage Jewish communities to engage in refugee aid and services. As of 2017, HIAS initiatives include: * National Rabbinic Letter: HIAS organized an open letter urging elected officials to continue accepting refugees into the U.S. The letter was signed by 2,001 rabbis as of May 2017. * HIAS Welcome Campaign: More than 430 synagogues participate in this campaign to support newly resettled refugee families in their communities.\\"Welcome Campaign Congregations\\"HIAS.org website * Legal Action: In February 2017, HIAS initiated a legal challenge against U.S. President Trump's executive order entitled \\"Protecting the Nation from Terrorist Entry into the United States.\\" The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, Southern Division on February 7, 2017. In Vienna and Kyiv, HIAS helps Jews and others from 43 countries receive protection and seek asylum or resettlement. In 2016 HIAS opened an office on the Greek island of Lesvos to provide legal services for refugees arriving by sea, predominantly from Syria. In the Middle East, HIAS helps Jewish and other religious minorities from Iran come to the U.S. In Israel, HIAS provides scholarships for those who have recently immigrated to the Jewish state and assists African asylum seekers. The organization also supports the resettlement of refugees of the Syrian Civil War in Jordan.\\"Jewish groups sending aid to Syrian refugees in Jordan.\\" Jewish Journal. July 25, 2013. July 25, 2013. In Chad, HIAS provides trauma counseling and social services in 12 of that country's camps for refugees from the Darfur region of Sudan and facilitates relocation for those who need additional protection. In Kenya, HIAS' trauma counseling and resettlement operations focus on the needs of the most vulnerable of the 250,000 people displaced by conflicts in Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Rwanda, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In Latin America, HIAS provides full-service counseling, legal services, and humanitarian assistance for Colombian refugees fleeing to Ecuador and Venezuela. It also facilitates the resettlement and integration of refugees in Argentina and Uruguay. HIAS opened its newest Latin American office in Costa Rica, in February 2017.  HIAS archives  Some records of HIAS from 1900 to 1970 (415 linear feet and 851 reels of microfilm) are currently held by YIVO Institute for Jewish Research and are available for research. Other records (more than 1,800 linear feet) are held by the American Jewish Historical Society (AJHS) and are currently being processed. The bulk of these records span from the late 1940s to the 1990s but some records (such as the meeting minutes of the Board of Directors) go back as far as 1912. These records will be available for research in late 2018.

This phenomenon, the process of which is called cap formation, was discovered in 1971 on lymphocytes and is a property of amoebae and all locomotory animal cells except sperm. The crosslinking is most easily achieved using a polyvalent antibody to a surface antigen on the cell. Cap formation can be visualised by attaching a fluorophore, such as fluorescein, to the antibody. Steps #The antibody is bound to the cell. If the antibody is non-crosslinking (such as a Fab antibody fragment), the bound antibody is uniformly distributed. This can be done at 0 ¬∞C, room temperature, or 37 ¬∞C. #If the antibody is crosslinking and bound to the cells at 0 ¬∞C, the distribution of antibodies has a patchy appearance. These ‚Äúpatches‚Äù are two- dimensional precipitates of antigen-antibody complex and are quite analogous to the three-dimensional precipitates that form in solution. #If cells with patches are warmed up, the patches move to one end of the cell to form a cap. In lymphocytes, this capping process takes about 5 minutes. If carried out on cells attached to a substratum, the cap forms at the rear of the moving cell. Capping only occurs on motile cells and is therefore believed to reflect an intrinsic property of how cells move. It is an energy dependent process and in lymphocytes is partially inhibited by cytochalasin B (which disrupts microfilaments) but unaffected by colchicine (which disrupts microtubules). However, a combination of these drugs eliminates capping. A key feature of capping is that only those molecules that are crosslinked cap: Others do not. Cap formation is now seen as closely related to the carbon particle experiments of Abercrombie. In this case, crawling fibroblasts were held in a medium containing small (~1 micrometre in size) carbon particles. On occasion, these particles attached to the front leading edge of these cells: When they did so, the particles were observed to move rearward on the cell's dorsal surface. They did so in a roughly straight line, with the particle remaining initially stationary with respect to the substratum. The cell seemed to ooze forward under the particle. In view of what we know of capping, this phenomenon is now interpreted as follows: The particle is presumably stuck to many surface molecules, crosslinking them and forming a patch. As in capping, the particle moves toward the back of the cell. Proposed mechanisms=\\"Flow\\" Abercrombie thought that the carbon particle is a marker on the cell surface and its behaviour reflects what the surface is doing. This led him to propose that, as a cell moves, membrane from internal stores is added at the front of the cell‚Äîenabling the cell to extend forward‚Äîand retrieved toward the rear of the cell. This process of exocytosis at the front of the cell and endocytosis elsewhere has been modified by Bretscher. He and Hopkins showed that the specific membrane endocytosed by coated pits on motile cells is returned by exocytosis to the cell surface at the leading edge. The spatial difference between the sites of exocytosis (at the front) and endocytosis (everywhere on the surface) leads to a flow of the matrix of the plasma membrane‚Äîlipids‚Äîfrom the front toward the rear. Large objects, such as patches, would be swept along with this flow, whereas non-crosslinked small molecules would be able to diffuse by Brownian motion against the flow and so evade being swept backward. Hence, in this theory, the need for crosslinking. Bretscher proposed that on stationary cells exocytosis is random‚Äîand therefore a major difference between motile and nonmotile cells. \\"Cytoskeleton\\" An alternative view is that the patches are moved to the rear of the cell by direct attachment to the actin cytoskeleton. The molecular mechanism for how this could be achieved is unclear, since, when glycolipids or GPI-bound proteins (in the outer monolayer of the cell's surface bilayer) are crosslinked, they cap, just like any surface protein. As these molecules cannot themselves interact directly with the cytoplasmic actin cytoskeleton, this scheme seems unlikely. \\"Rake\\" A third scheme, by de Petris,de Petris, S. Distribution and mobility of plasma membrane components (ed. Poste, G. a. N., G.L.) (North Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam., 1977) suggests that a motile cell is continuously raking its surface from front to back: Any aggregates (but not uncrosslinked molecules) caught in the teeth of the rake are moved to the back of the cell. In this scheme, the nature of the tines of the rake are not specified but could, for example, be surface integrins that often act as the feet of the cell to attach it to the substrate. The force required to rake the surface could be provided by the actin cytoskeleton. \\"Surf\\" A fourth scheme, by Hewitt, suggests that motile cells have rearward waves on their surfaces: patches, but not single molecules, become entrained in these waves and are thus moved to the back of the cell.

Biography Born in Amsterdam, New York, she came from a large Irish-American family. Her father died when she was fifteen so she decided to go onto the stage. A year later she was doing a specialty dance which earned her the nicknames of St Vitis, Mosquito and Lightning. Courtney's first role as a singer and dancer came in the musical The Little Whopper in 1919. She became well-known among New York theatrical audiences for her work in Good News (1927), a musical comedy about college life. Her other credits include Spring Is Here in 1929 and America's Sweetheart in 1931. In the early 1930s, Miss Courtney left Broadway and went to Hollywood. Courtney acted in 58 films between 1930 and 1940. She secured her first movie work by asking Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures for his assistance. The red-headed comedian made her screen debut as Cousin Betty in Loose Ankles (1930). The film co-starred Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and Loretta Young. Her many movie credits include The Raven (1935), Suzy (1936), The Shop Around the Corner (1940), and Turnabout (1940), her last film. Courtney was married to an Italian nobleman, whereby she acquired the title Marchesa, but did not use it. She died at the Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune, New Jersey in 1975 of undisclosed causes at the age of 77.

Biography He was born in Huntsville, Alabama to John Phelan and Priscilla Oakes (Ford) Morris, a niece of Sir Richard Oakes of Scotland. They married on 8 June 1807. His father John Phelan was a native of Marysbourough, Queen's County, Ireland. John Phelan was the grand-nephew of James Phelan, Bishop of Ossory (d. 1695). John Phelan married Mary Sluigan, of Cloncons Castle, King's County, and came to the United States in 1793, at the age of twenty-four. He settled first in New York city, and afterwards moved to New Jersey, where he was cashier of the Bank of New Brunswick, moving to Huntsville, Alabama in 1818.Robert Early Phelan entry at Encyclopedia of American biography: New series, Volume 22, American Historical Society, 1959 James Phelan was apprenticed as a printer to the Democrat at fourteen years of age, subsequently edited the Flag of the Union, a Democratic organ, and became state printer in 1843. He was admitted to the bar in 1846, moved to Mississippi in 1849, and settled in Aberdeen, where he soon established a large practice. He became a member of the Mississippi State Senate in 1860, then was elected as a Senator from Mississippi in the First Confederate Congress 1862‚Äì64. In 1863, he introduced what was called the \\"Crucial bill of the Confederacy,\\" which was a proposition to confiscate all the cotton in the South, paying for it in Confederate bonds, and using it as a basis for a foreign loan. The bill passed the house, but was defeated in the senate, and created so much indignation among the planters that Phelan was burned in effigy, and defeated in the next election. After 1864, Phelan served as judge advocate till the end of the war, when he settled in Memphis, Tennessee, and practised law in a firm formed with Henry T. Ellett in that city until his death. He was interred in Aberdeen, Mississippi, following his death at the age of 51. Personal life His brother, John Dennis Phelan, was a noted lawyer, jurist and politician. His son James Phelan Jr. became a congressman.

It had over 200 free internet radio stations.  History = Roots  AOL Radio can trace its roots to two companies it acquired on June 1, 1999, for $400 million: Spinner.com and Nullsoft. Spinner.com was formerly known as TheDJ.com. Nullsoft was the maker of the popular Winamp and SHOUTcast products. Both new organizations operated out of the same office in San Francisco. The Spinner.com brand was retired in July 2003. AOL Radio launched as Radio@AOL, essentially a rebranded Spinner.com, using technology from RealNetworks on October 16, 2001 as part of the AOL 7.0 software announced that same day. In its first month of operation, AOL reported that 2.2 million members accessed Radio@AOL, making it one of AOL's most popular features. Initially, Radio@AOL was available only to AOL members. On May 22, 2002, AOL released the free Radio@Netscape for non-members as part of the new Netscape 7.0 browser. On August 22, 2002, AOL released Radio@Netscape Plus. Beginning in 2004, AOL started metering Radio@Netscape to allow only two hours of usage per day. AOL did this to avoid paying copyright royalties and to encourage users to become AOL members. On November 28, 2007, AOL announced that they might shut down their web radio services after a 38 percent increase in royalties to air music. Yahoo! and AOL discontinued directing users to their radio sites after SoundExchange, the non-profit performance rights organization that collects royalties on the behalf of sound recording copyright owners (SRCOs) and featured artists for non-interactive digital transmissions, began collecting the higher fees in July.  Partnership with CBS Radio  On April 30, 2008, XM and AOL Radio ended their partnership due to the change in Internet royalty rates. On June 10, 2008, a new AOL Radio player debuted with 150 streaming CBS Radio stations. On February 4, 2010, AOL Radio banned users outside the U.S. from streaming online radio. An error message pointed to Last FM. \\"We're sorry, this station is unavailable from your current location. Instead, enjoy listening to....\\" Later AOL Radio content became featured on CBS Radio's Radio.com when the site launched.  Partnership with Slacker  In October 2011, AOL ended its partnership with CBS Radio and became partners with Slacker. They now offer a subscription plan. This new format allows songs to be favorited or banned (rather than using an out-of-five rating system) and allows artists to be banned altogether. In July 2013, AOL Radio updated the site's look to match that of its parent company Slacker Radio. AOL Radio was merged with Slacker Radio and discontinued on December 1, 2017.  Marketing  On November 18, 2002, AOL introduced Broadband Radio@AOL. Broadband Radio@AOL was built into the AOL 8.0 software, and was the first AOL Radio offering based on the AOL streaming technology Ultravox. By 2003, AOL had migrated most of its AOL Radio products to Ultravox. It was released in the UK on October 20, 2003. On April 11, 2005, AOL and XM Satellite Radio joined together to create Radio@AOL featuring XM. At the same time, AOL consolidated Radio@AOL and Radio@Netscape as \\"Radio@AOL featuring XM\\". This service was available to AOL members and non-members alike, with twenty XM channels offered (fifty more XM channels require a paying AOL subscription). Later in 2005, AOL changed the name of Radio@AOL to AOL Radio to align itself with the AOL Music branding. In July 2005, a web version of AOL Radio was introduced for non-members with unlimited listening. At the end of 2005, Radio@Netscape was officially retired, with AOL Radio being the official brand. On April 30, 2008, AOL and XM Satellite Radio announced the end of their partnership and the beginning of the new partnership between AOL and CBS Radio. The partnership between AOL and CBS Radio would give AOL access to over 150 of CBS Radio's terrestrial stations. On June 10, 2008, the AOL CBS player for AIM was released. On June 11, 2008, the new AOL CBS Radio player for the web was released.  Technology  AOL Radio powered by CBS Radio was supported on Adobe Flash 9 and was compatible with web browsers that supported Flash 9 on Windows 2000 through Windows Vista and Mac OS X. Listeners could connect to AOL Radio through the web, AOL Client, and AOL Radio for Mac. On July 10, 2008, AOL released a client for Apple's iPhone and iPod Touch via the App Store offering mobile streaming of all stations though WiFi, EDGE and 3G cellular connections. AOL Radio is now also available through the AOL Instant Messenger service, and Winamp.

It is owned by ViacomCBS Networks Americas, a subsidiary of ViacomCBS. The channel broadcasts music videos as well as reality shows, TV series and movies, which may be directly or indirectly related to music, aimed at the youth. Its schedule is focused on certain musical genres, mainly pop, soft rock, reggaeton, Latin pop and trap. Each of these categories includes music in English and Spanish. MTV Latin America is headquartered in Miami Beach and has three feeds covering the region, centred in Argentina, Colombia and Mexico. The channel has also produced its own versions of MTV reality shows like Room Raiders or Dismissed, but most of the time curse words are not censored in Latin American countries (specially during the watershed time). The first video broadcast by the network was We are sudamerican rockers by Chilean band Los Prisioneros.Los Prisioneros, Allmusic History A few important events in the late 1980s led to the creation of MTV Latin America. Firstly, the program \\"MTV International\\" was created in 1988 and led by Daisy Fuentes. This weekly program was broadcast through Latin American and American channels and presented music videos from both regions. A second catalyst was the rise of the \\"Spanish Rock fever\\", which included artists such as Argentinean rockers Miguel Mateos and Soda Stereo. Lastly, during these years the first-ever Spanish rock concert in the US. was put on by Miguel Mateos, which created excitement amongst Latino communities in the United States. MTV (Latin America) logo used from 1993 to 2009. MTV (Latin America) logo used from 2009 to 2011. With the growing popularity of Latino artists, channel executives began to take notice and realized the increasing quality and popularity of music sung in Spanish. After considering the success of other international MTV channels, such as MTV Europe and MTV Brasil, MTV Networks launched \\"MTV in Spanish\\" in October 1993. The channel had one signal to broadcast to all of Latin America. All programs were recorded and produced in Miami, FL where the studios were located. Daisy Fuentes became one of the first VJs for the channel. Beto Gonz√°lez from Guatemala was in charge of MTV media and ads from 1994 from 1999, later succeeded by Gus Rodr√≠guez from M√©xico. As the channel began to experience growing popularity in the early part of 1995,Medios y mercados de Latinoam√©rica, Latinoam√©rica y negocios, Estados unidos, 1996 new shows were added to the program. For the first time, shows unrelated to music were broadcast, such as Beavis and Butthead. MTV News was added, a segment dedicated to news on celebrities, film, politics and social issues, usually combining subjective and objective commentary. Lastly, in this same year the show Connection was launched, the most popular show in the channel's history, which has remained on air for a record length of time and boasts the largest audience of any program in the history of the channel. Given the channel's social and economic growth, in April 1996 \\"MTV in Spanish\\" was divided into two regional signals, \\"North\\", covering Mexico, Central America, Colombia and Venezuela, and \\"South\\", covering the rest of the region. This division was created in order to cater programming more closely to distinct audiences. As a result, in 1996 MTV became the number one music channel in Latin America. The channel also became one of the first US television brands to develop a website for Latin America audiences with the launch MTVLA.com in partnership with the Miami-based company Internet Marketing Consultants. However, during the 1990s the channel began experiencing problems. The musical aspect of \\"MTV in Spanish\\" was disorganized and the channel was having trouble catering to distinct regional tastes. Executives decided to segment audiences by dividing the channel into three signals: \\"MTV Mexico\\", \\"MTV Central\\" (Colombia) and \\"MTV Argentina\\", with studios and regional offices located in capital cities of each country. During this time, the channel began to show American MTV programs subtitled in Spanish. As well, in the year 2000, MTV created a new signal directed towards Chile, known as \\"MTV Southwest\\", which repeated programming from MTV Mexico but adjusted to Chilean time. While at first MTV thought about repeating MTV Argentina‚Äôs programming for the Chilean signal because of the proximity of the countries, it was decided that considering cultural traits and the difference in accents between Chilean and Argentine Spanish, it would be more suitable to adapt Mexican programming for the Chilean signal. However, in 2002, MTV Southwest was cancelled due to the low number of viewers. Currently, three signals operate in Latin America: \\"MTV North\\", covering Mexico, \\"MTV Central\\", covering Colombia, Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Peru and Central American countries, and \\"MTV South\\", covering Argentina, Chile, Venezuela, Paraguay and Uruguay.

Public reception MTV Latin America, like other MTV channels around the world, has been one of the first television channels to receive criticisms, largely from their own viewers. While many criticisms apply to MTV as a whole, some criticisms apply specifically to MTV Latin America. One reason for these criticisms is that certain videos and reality shows on MTV Latin America are not censored. One of the main criticisms against MTV Latin America is that it is merely a commercial channel, whose broadcasting of videos is based on only economic interests and not on audience requests. MTV has been accused of being excessively commercial and an advertising tool for major music corporations. MTV has undermined the importance of the music itself, replacing it with merely a visual esthetic. This creates a negative public image for MTV.Emol: El mercurio online, Hace 25 a√±os naci√≥ MTV, la revoluci√≥n musical de la pantalla chica , Chile, 28 de julio de 2006 As well, MTV has recently been criticized for broadcasting too many reality shows, distancing itself from its original purpose, which was to broadcast musical programming.F√≥rmula tv, La cadena MTV cumpli√≥ 25 a√±os de historia musical el 1 de agosto, Espa√±a, 2006 MTV has argued that these shows include music from current artists in their soundtrack, such as Laguna Beach. This show in particular has caused great controversy among viewers as it offers content completely unrelated to music. Another criticism against MTV is that the channel spreads and promotes inappropriate behaviour among youth, in both music videos and shows.Calabozo No mires MTV!?!?, Espa√±a, 2006 Some controversial content include sex, early pregnancy, general violence, use of drugs, daily drinking and smoking habits of celebrities and domestic violence. A final criticism, exclusive to MTV Latin America, relates to the form in which titles are presented on the screen, which usually includes a variety of orthographical errors such as missing accents and use of exclamation and question marks. Critics argue that these errors do not aid in didactic learning for viewers, the majority of which are youth.De todo hay en la vida del ¬¥se√±or... MTV Y EL REGAETON (O como se escriba‚Ä¶), Valencia, Venezuela 29 de junio de 2006 However, MTV Latin America has also made many positive achievements. Between 2005 and 2006, MTV broadcast a campaign entitled ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Kill the Music‚Äù, which aimed to broadcast a message of awareness to youth about music in general.Inconciente Colectivo, MTV: Don¬¥t Kill the Music, Chile, 12 de enero de 2006, As well the channel has created various projects to help independent Hispanic bands and musical artists. Feeds MTV Latin America is divided in the following feeds; *South feed: available in Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela. It uses the Argentine Standard Time (UTC-3) as its main time zone. Since February 2018, it bases most of its programming on music videos, up to 18 hours daily, leaving reality shows that are broadcast on the other feeds only airing on primetime. In contrast with the other feeds, the South feed shows the Buenos Aires time and weather on the bottom-right corner of the screen, features only present in Argentine terrestrial television stations. Additionally, this feed is being carried by satellite providers DirecTV and Movistar TV in South America. *Central feed: available in Colombia, Bolivia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru and the Caribbean. It uses the Colombian Standard Time (UTC-5) as its main time zone. *North feed: available only in Mexico. It uses the Mexican Central Time (UTC-6/-5 DST) as its main time zone.

Its striking blue and white horizontal stripes have made it what many consider the 'poster fish' for the Red Sea reef environment. It is a valued aquarium fish. Like other tangs, the sohal tang is compressed laterally, making it extremely maneuverable and fast along the reef. It has a horizontal, blade-like spine along the base of its tail on both sides, which folds into the fish, pointing anteriorly towards the head. During defense and aggression, tangs flick the spine at other fish or intruders, causing physical harm. The surgeonfish are named for this scalpel- like spine. Its primary diet consists mostly of vegetable matter, but occasionally includes the flesh of other animals. Sohal tangs have been known to nip at clam mantles and soft large-polyp and small-polyp stony corals. Its range includes all reef environments in the Red Sea, to 90 ft or deeper. It is one of the most aggressive tangs, and combined with its large size for a tang, is a dominant fish along the Red Sea reef. In the aquarium This fish needs a lot of swimming space and is a constant grazer for marine macroalgae. Its innate dominant and aggressive nature suggest only a single specimen should be kept in each aquarium. If healthy, aquarium specimen should live up to 10‚Äì15 years. Specimen selection Alertness, swimming behavior and breathing rate should be the main factors when choosing the ideal Sohal Tang. Smaller specimens ~3 inch or more should be considered as it is better able to adapt to the aquarium environment and diet. Specimen's color should not be considered an important factor when selecting appropriate specimen. An ideal specimen should be alert and curious, constantly swimming, breathing should be constant and show sign of aggressiveness to other tankmates. Disease prevention/care An aquarium size of more than 180 gallons (700 ‚Ñì), with strong water movement and ample liverock structures are preferred for this species, due to its constant roaming nature. Due to its aggressive nature, this species should be added to the aquarium last. Initial purchase should be Freshwater Dipped and quarantine in a designated Quarantine Tank (QT), with similar/identical water parameter. It is suggested the Quarantine Tank water should be of lower salinity as this will eliminate most ectoparasites on the body of the fish. When specimen is fully quarantined, it then can be introduced to the display aquarium. Sohal Tang's diet should consist primarily of Algae or vegetable matter. It has been suggested that \\"Sushi Nori\\" can be the main diet of this fish. Other than Algae, the diet should be supplemented with a variety of frozen Mysis shrimps or other similar food items. They are a constant grazer which will scrap off marine algae in the aquarium. It is therefore recommended that it be fed several times each day.

In the 1960s and early 1970s Mintz was an underground radio DJ and host. In the 1970s he became a spokesperson for John Lennon and Yoko Ono, and took on other musicians and actors as clients as a publicist, including Bob Dylan. He later became the publicist for Paris Hilton and Canadian drummer Neil Peart from Rush. Early life Mintz was born in the Bronx borough of New York City on February 16, 1945. In 1963 he moved to California to attend Los Angeles City College, partly inspired by the film The Misfits, where he studied broadcasting and began to do radio interviews. Early interviews by Mintz included Jayne Mansfield and Jack Lemmon. His first interview to be broadcast nationally came after the death of John F. Kennedy, when he discovered a classmate of his, Roland Bynum, had known Lee Harvey Oswald while in the US Marines together. The interview was the first character and background interview done about Oswald in the US, and was picked up by the national and international radio broadcast networks. He then became an underground radio D.J. in the 1960s. Radio and television career From 1966 to 1968, Elliot Mintz had two shows on KPFK in Los Angeles, California, Looking In and Looking Out.http://www.pacificaradioarchives.org/projects/folios/6801kpfk/pdfs/6801kpfk.pdf , see schedule for the 27th at 10PM. The shows provided a platform for community conversation as well as for interviews Mintz would do with public figures. Each show would begin with a series of rhetorical questions, which listeners could call in to respond to. When he started with KPFK, Mintz was the youngest talkshow host in the US, at the age of 21, broadcasting a nightly radio show on the station. In 1971 he hosted a Kaiser Broadcasting syndicated television show called Headshop that integrated musical guests with film clips shot in and around Southern California. From 1973 to 1974, Mintz was the entertainment correspondent for Eyewitness News on KABC television in Los Angeles. He also worked on-air at KLAC (1968‚Äì69), KMET (1969), and KLOS (1970‚Äì71). During this part of his career he interviewed Hollywood actors and recording artists, and lived next door to Timothy Leary. In 1980 Mintz received a California Associated Press, Television, and Radio Association award for his November 30, 1979 radio interview of an Iranian student at the American Embassy in Tehran during the Iran Hostage Crisis. Mintz's interviews include those with Mort Sahl, Norman Mailer, Ray Bradbury, Alan Watts, Salvador Dali, Jack Lemmon, John Wayne, Groucho Marx, Timothy Leary, Jack Nicholson, Allen Ginsberg, Jayne Mansfield, Raquel Welch, Karen Black, and musicians like John Lennon, Donna Summer, John Coltrane, Stevie Wonder, Ringo Starr, Alice Cooper, and Mick Jagger. Mintz was the host of the television interview show Head Shop, where he interviewed individuals including Kris Kristofferson. He retired in 2014, upon which he released a website containing his past interviews for download. Other radio stations he worked for include KPPC, KABC, Earth News Radio, Innerview, and Westwood One. Public relations career Elliot Mintz is a public relations person and spokesperson for individuals and corporate clients. His first client was Bobby Sherman during the 1960s. He also represented John Lennon and Yoko Ono, whom he befriended in 1971. He joined their entourage throughout the 1970s and remains a spokesperson for both the John Lennon Estate and Ono. Other clients of Mintz's have included Christie Brinkley, Crosby, Stills and Nash, Diana Ross, Don Johnson, Janet Jones, Melanie Griffith, and Bob Dylan. During the 2000s Mintz represented Paris Hilton, and appeared on her television show The Simple Life. John Lennon and Yoko Ono Though not in a professional capacity, since the death of Lennon, Mintz has acted as a spokesperson for the Lennon estate. In addition, while sifting through Lennon's belongings, he discovered hundreds of unreleased tape recordings including half-finished new songs, early versions of famous hits, and idle thoughts. Beginning in 1988, he hosted a weekly syndicated radio series based upon these recordings called The Lost Lennon Tapes, which was broadcast for about four years. After the show came to an end, Mintz began hosting the spinoff radio program The Beatle Years. Mintz has appeared in feature documentaries about Lennon and Yoko Ono, including The U.S. vs. John Lennon, Imagine: John Lennon and The Real Yoko Ono. In 1985 he was a technical advisor on the television film John and Yoko: A Love Story. He also authored an essay about his relationship with them published in 2005 in a book entitled Memories of John Lennon.

During the 1980s he co- produced (along with Rod Argent) many of Tanita Tikaram's hits.  Education and early life  Van Hooke grew up in Stanmore, Middlesex and attended Mill Hill school. His schoolmate Chaz Jankel (later of the Blockheads) lived close by, and the two formed The Call of The Wild. This band became the Ric Parnell Independence, featuring the son of bandleader Jack Parnell as vocalist (later to join Atomic Rooster as drummer, and take the part of the drummer in the movie This is Spinal Tap).  Recording career  Van Hooke played drums on Van Morrison's albums from 1978's Wavelength, Into the Music (1979), Common One (1980), Beautiful Vision (1982), Inarticulate Speech of the Heart (1983), the live album, Live at the Grand Opera House Belfast recorded in 1983 and released in 1984, and The Philosopher's Stone (1998).

It was broadcast on the BBC from 1963 to 1981. It was directed and produced by Harold Snoad. The show was broadcast over 18 series with 166 episodes. The show experienced sustained popularity in the 1960s and 1970s. The BBC described the show as featuring 'a vivid cast of comic grotesques'. Frequent performers included Pat Coombs, Deryck Guyler, Roy Kinnear, Joan Sims and Josephine Tewson. The principal writers of the programme were David Cummings, John Singer, and John Warren. Additional contributions were by David Nobbs and Peter Tinniswood. Other writers included Dick Clement, Barry Cryer, Selma Diamond, John Esmonde, Marty Feldman, Lucille Kallen, Bob Larbey and Harold Pinter. The American comedy writers Mel Brooks and Mel Tolkin contributed sketches in the early years of the show. The nature of the show with its rapid sketches was initially inspired by the American sketch show Your Show of Shows starring Sid Caesar that was broadcast between 1950 and 1954 on NBC. Emery later developed his own characters for sketches. The show became anachronistic with the advent of the 1980s, being perceived as homophobic, racist, and sexist. In an appraisal of The Dick Emery Show the BBC wrote that none of the show's sketches would 'seem out of place' on the 2000's BBC sketch show Little Britain. Peri Bradley critiqued the show in the chapter \\"The Politics of Camp\\" in British Culture and Society in the 1970s: The Lost Decade. Bradley examined how camp could \\"operate as a political and liberating force\\" in the 1970s; and felt that Emery's characters \\"comprised representations [which] instigated\\" a \\"transformation of consciousness\\" as described by the gender theorist Judith Butler. Out-takes of corpsing from the series were subsequently included in the show in a section called 'The Comedy of Errors'. Characters Characters portrayed by Emery included; Bovver Boy, a skinhead whose father was played by Roy Kinnear, the camp Clarence, Lampwick, a veteran of the First World War, and Mandy, a 'very friendly' blonde bombshell. Other characters included College, a tramp, Hattie, a 'menopausal would-be-maneater' and Ton-up Boy, a biker. Hattie and Mandy were both played by Emery in drag. Vox pops Contrived vox pops with the show's characters were a notable feature; this would later be featured in the shows of Fry and Laurie. The format was developed by David Cummings and the interviewer was played by Peter Elliot. Each character played by Emery would be asked the same question by the interviewer. The vox pops that featured Mandy, a 'very friendly blonde bombshell', would end with her perceiving a double entendre in the innocuous question of the reporter and then after giving them a 'friendly but over- forceful push' and saying her catchphrase, \\"Ooh, you are awful, but I like you\\". The popularity of Mandy's catchphrase would see it included in the Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations, described as 'Mandy's habitual protest'.

On 7 November 921, the Treaty of Bonn, the text of which calls itself a \\"pact of friendship\\" (amicitia), was signed between Charles III of France and Henry I of Germany in a minimalist ceremony aboard a ship in the middle of the Rhine not far from Bonn.Heinrich Fichtenau, Living in the Tenth Century: Mentalities and Social Orders, Patrick J.

The use of the river, which was the border between their two kingdoms, as a neutral territory had extensive Carolingian precedents and was also used in classical antiquity and in contemporary Anglo- Saxon England.Julia Barrow, \\"Demonstrative behaviour and political communication in later Anglo-Saxon England\\", Anglo-Saxon England 36 (2007), 141. The treaty, which \\"more than most such amicitiae, was decidedly bilateral, reciprocal and equal\\", recognised the border of the two realms and the authority of their respective kings.Geoffrey Koziol, \\"Charles the Simple, Robert of Neustria, and the vexilla of Saint-Denis\\", Early Medieval Europe 14:4 (2006), 385‚Äì86. It confirmed the legitimacy of Henry's election by the German princes and of Charles's rule over Lotharingia through the election by its princes. In the treaty, Henry is titled rex Francorum orientalium (King of the East Franks) and Charles rex Francorum occidentalium (King of the West Franks) in recognition of the division it made of the former Frankish Empire. Charles and his bishops and counts signed first, both because he had been king longer and because he was of Carolingian stock. The treaty was ineffective. In January or early February 923, Henry made a pact of amicitia with the usurper Robert I against Charles, who subsequently sent a legate to Henry with the relic of the hand of Dionysius the Areopagite, sheathed in gold and studded in gems, \\"as a sign of faith and truth [and] a pledge of perpetual union and mutual love\\" in the words of Widukind of Corvey.Koziol (2006), 385 n80.

This grass is native to the Americas, where it is widespread. It can be found on other continents as well, where it is naturalized. It is extremely salt tolerant.Mojave Desert Wildflowers, Pam MacKay, 2nd ed. 2013, p 284 Distribution and habitat Distichlis spicata thrives along coastlines and on salt flats and disturbed soils, as well as forest, woodland, montane, and desert scrub habitats. It can form dense monotypic stands, and it often grows in clonal colonies. Non-clonal populations tend to be skewed toward a majority of one sex or the other. The grass forms sod with its hearty root system. Its rhizomes have sharp points which allow it to penetrate hard soils and aerenchymous tissues, which allow it to grow underwater and in mud. This plant grows easily in salty and alkaline soils, excreting salts from its tissues via salt glands. Description Distichlis spicata is a hardy perennial with rhizomes and sometimes stolons. It is an erect grass which occasionally approaches half a meter in height but is generally shorter. The solid, stiff stems have narrow leaves up to 10 centimeters in length, which may be crusted with salt in saline environments. This species is dioecious, meaning the male flowers and female flowers grow on separate individuals. The pistillate inflorescence may be up to 8 centimeters long, with green or purple-tinted spikelets. The staminate flowers look quite similar, thinner but larger overall and denser. The flower parts of both sex may be bright pinkish-purple. Uses Because it gets rid of excess salts by secreting it onto its surfaces, the Kawaiisu Indians were able to make salt blocks by scraping off the salt. \\"Under favorable soil and moisture conditions, studies have shown Saltgrass favorable for pastures irrigated with saline water. The total dry matter yields were 9081 kg/ha with a total protein production of 1300 kg/ha. Saltgrass is grazed by both cattle and horses and it has a forage value of fair to good because it remains green when most other grasses are dry during the drought periods and it is resistant to grazing and trampling. It is cropped both when green and in the dry state; however, it is most commonly used the winter for livestock feed.

It was formed when in 1943 the National Park Service gave to Indiana's Department of Conservation land to form a state park, with other land along the river becoming the Winamac Fish and Wildlife Area.http://www.in.gov/dnr/3245.htm Official (Indiana) DNR Historical Timeline During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the national government established the Recreational Demonstration Area in the Department of the Interior, National Park Service. The Park Service located low quality farmlands with high quality park potential. Along the Tippecanoe River, the Federal Government purchased .Tippecanoe River State Park, Indiana Department of Natural Resources; Indianapolis, Indiana 2008 The high sand content of the soil made this poor quality farm lands. The river way and forest made it quality parklands. Development of the Demonstration Area was undertaken by the Works Progress Administration.

On January 1, 1959, were transferred to the Division of Fish and Wildlife as the Winamac Fish and Wildlife Area. The state park retains of the original development. The river Canoeing is very popular in the park, as the Tippecanoe River stretches seven miles (11 km) along the park's borders. A canoe-exclusive campsite has ten sites. It is also a river otter release area. Bluegill and bass are commonly fished from the river. The river is too dangerous for swimming, so those camping in the park can go to the Bass Lake State Beach five miles (8 km) away.

This genus and the closely related Acanthostega and Ichthyostega represent the earliest tetrapods. Description Tulerpeton is considered one of the first \\"tetrapods\\" (in the broad sense of the word) to have evolved. It is known from a fragmented skull, the left side of the pectoral girdle, and the entire right forelimb and right hindlimb along with a few belly scales. This species is differentiated from the less derived \\"aquatic tetrapods\\" (such as Acanthostega and Ichthyostega) by a strengthened limb structure. These limbs consist of 6 toes and fingers. Additionally, its limbs appear to have evolved for powerful paddling rather than walking. The fossil fragments also indicate that its head was disconnected from the pectoral girdle. From the absence of the rough postbranchial lamina of the pectoral girdle, it has been determined that Tulerpeton had no gills and was therefore entirely dependent on breathing air. Era Tulerpeton lived approximately 365 million years ago,Recent Transitionals in the Late Devonian period when the climate was fairly warm and there were no glaciers. Land had already been colonized by plants. During the Devonian period, the first truly terrestrial tetrapods ‚Äì the ancestors of present-day reptiles, birds, amphibians and mammals ‚Äì first began to appear. Lifestyle Even though Tulerpeton breathed air, it lived mainly in shallow marine water. The Andreyevka fossil bed where it was discovered was at least 200 km from the nearest landmass during this era. The fossils of plants in the area tell us that the salinity of the waters where it lived fluctuated wildly, indicating that the waters were quite shallow. Because the bones of the neck and the pectoral girdle were disconnected, Tulerpeton could lift its head. Therefore, in shallow water, it had a considerable advantage over the other animals whose heads only moved side to side. The later land animals that descended from Tulerpeton‚Äôs relatives needed this head flexion on land, but the condition probably evolved because of the advantage that this gave it in shallow marine waters, not for land. In the book ‚ÄúVertebrate Life‚Äù, authors Pough, Janis, and Heiser say that,‚Äù The development of a distinct neck, with the loss of the opercular bones and the later gain of a specialized articulation between the skull and the vertebral column (not yet present in the earliest tetrapods), may be related to lifting the snout out of the water to air or to snap at prey items.‚Äù The six fingered hands and toes were stronger than the fins from which they developed, therefore Tulerpeton had an advantage in propelling itself through shallow and brackish water, but the limbs do not yet seem strong enough for extensive use on land. Significance of the find Tulerpeton is one of the early transition tetrapods ‚Äì a marine animal capable of living on land. The separation of the pectoral-shoulder girdle from the head allowed the head to move up and down, and the strengthening of the legs and arms allowed the early tetrapods to propel themselves on land. Tulerpeton is important in the study of dactyly. The polydactyl (more than 5 toes) condition of Tulerpeton caused considerable comment when the fossil was first discovered. Before the discovery, the pentyldactyl, the 5-fingered condition that is ancestral to all living tetrapods, was thought to have developed before the first terrestrial tetrapods appeared. But the discoveries of Acanthostega and Ichthyostega confirm that the pentyldactyl ancestor came later in the development of tetrapods. Phylogenetic studies conducted by Lebedev and Coates (1995) and Coates (1996) indicated that Tulerpeton was the earliest and basalmost member of the clade containing amniotes and all extinct tetrapods that were more closely related to amniotes than to lissamphibians (living amphibians). However, later phylogenetic studies recovered Tulerpeton outside the least inclusive clade containing amniotes and lissamphibians, finding it to be more distantly related to amniotes than such extinct tetrapods as lepospondyls, seymouriamorphs, Embolomeri, temnospondyls, baphetids, colosteids and whatcheeriids were.Chapter 6: \\"Walking with early tetrapods: evolution of the postcranial skeleton and the phylogenetic affinities of the Temnospondyli (Vertebrata: Tetrapoda).\\" In: Kat Pawley (2006). \\"The postcranial skeleton of temnospondyls (Tetrapoda: temnospondyli).\\" PhD Thesis. La Trobe University, Melbourne. Michael Benton (2005) noted that, due to the fact that Tulerpeton had more than 5 toes, establishing its exact phylogenetic position is important to our understanding of digital reduction in tetrapods. If it indeed was more closely related to amniotes than lissamphibians are, it would mean that \\"reduction to five digits had to happen twice, once on the line to amphibians and once on the reptiliomorph line\\"; on the other hand, if it lies outside the least inclusive clade containing amniotes and lissamphibians, then \\"digital reduction happened once, between Tulerpeton and later tetrapods\\".Michael J.

On July 17, 2010, the band performed at the Hot Rod Hootenanny in Niagara Falls, Ontario. On October 25, the band performed in Prague, Czech Republic at the club Cross. On December 12, 2010, the band played alongside Random Hand, The Skints, The Hydropaths, Acid Drop and Mouthwash for the Slam Dunk punk/ska all dayer at the Cockpit in Leeds, England. Following a tour of Europe, they regrouped to begin material for their fourth album. Sarah \\"Sin\\" Blackwood's departure In January 2012, Sarah Blackwood guested with fellow Burlington, Ontario, band Walk off the Earth on a cover of Gotye's song Somebody That I Used To Know. The resulting video on YouTube went viral, gathering over 127 million views in four months and received positive responses from both Gotye and his co-singer on the song, Kimbra. On February 2012, the music industry publication Crazed Hits reported that the band had signed a recording contract with Columbia Records. The Creepshow had announced a tour of Europe and North America for the late summer - including dates in the United Kingdom in August. However, Walk Off The Earth soon announced a tour of their own, and on July 16, Blackwood uploaded a farewell video to her YouTube page, announcing she was leaving The Creepshow. Blackwood went on to join Walk Off The Earth on a permanent basis, starting with their Autumn tour and EP, R.E.V.O. Kenda \\"Twisted\\" Legaspi's arrival On July 16, 2012, the same day that Sarah Blackwood uploaded her YouTube video, the band released a statement on their Facebook page, announcing her departure and successor in one fell swoop. They said: : Hey there Creeps, : We know there's been a lot of rumours circulating out there lately, so we just wanted to fill you in on what's happening to put the speculation to rest. As you all know, Sarah is involved in a lot of different musical projects including her own solo project and Walk Off The Earth. Unfortunately it's simply not possible for her to devote herself to all of these awesome projects full-time so we were faced with a really difficult decision. We talked it all over together and looked at this from every possible angle, but it's with a heavy heart that we're announcing that Sarah \\"SIN\\" Blackwood will be leaving the Creepshow. : After 5+ years, two albums, several singles and countless tours with the band, Sarah will be sorely missed not just as a bandmate but as a great friend. We honestly couldn't be happier for her and we wish her all the very best with her music and new adventures. The Creepshow has always been about playing shows, putting out great songs and having a wicked time with our fans so with that said, the show must go on... : We'd also like to take this opportunity to let y'all know that our good friend Kenda will be stepping up to take over vocal duties. Kenda is a fixture in the Hamilton/Toronto music scene as both an accomplished singer and prolific tattoo artist. Please take a moment to welcome Kenda to the Creepshow family! We're currently working on writing new songs and sharpening up our live show‚Ä¶and we'll be sharing a brand new track with you in the weeks to come! Stay tuned for exciting news, tour announcements and much more! :* if you have any negative comments, we would appreciate you keeping them to yourself. Kenda's first dates with The Creepshow were Hamilton on Friday 27 July 2012 and Toronto the following day. The band then played four dates in Germany, before embarking upon a UK tour in August. In September, they played across North America, including some support slots with Dropkick Murphys. In October and November, they performed a headline tour of Canada, with support coming from The Fundamentals and The Hellbound Hepcats. On New Year's Eve, 2012, they supported NOFX in Montreal. Life After Death On January 7, 2013, the band announced via their Facebook page that they were recording demos for their new album in Toronto. They released a single \\"Sinners & Saints\\" on July 16, 2013 via digital download and limited edition 7\\" brown vinyl. The album, titled Life After Death, was released on October 21, 2013. The band continued to tour into their tenth anniversary year, including dates in the UK in 2015. They headlined the Arena at Rebellion Festival 2015 on Sunday 9 August. The song \\"Blood Blood Blood\\" appears in the closing credits of Borderlands 3's DLC \\"Psycho Krieg and the Fantastic Fustercluck\\".

History When the third stage of the Kryvyi Rih tram system was being planned, the Vivnopriadylna station was planned as a part of a development scheme for the area. Originally, the empty expanse that now surrounds the station was to be developed into a new housing district, with a factory located nearby. The factory near the station was eventually completed, but plans for the housing district were eventually abandoned due to lack of funding. The factory itself went out of business in 2001 due to financial issues. As a result, Vovnopriadylna is currently in the middle of nowhere, and with no passenger traffic at all, there are no plans to open the station in the future. Without the presence of humans, homeless dogs have, over the years, made the empty station their home. Architecture The completed section of the station consists of six small four-sided vaults and one large hexagonal vault, which was most likely intended as the place for the passenger concourse. The panels within the vault are made from aluminium. The station is left unadorned and technical equipment is also absent. White concrete fencing surrounds the station to prevent intruders from entering. External links * Mir Metro - Description and photos *Google maps - Satellite shot.

Publication Date (Web): March 24, 2007. It is also grown as an ornamental plant because of its large colorful flowers and pods. Names and taxonomy Its common names include spiny holdback, tara, taya, and algarroba tanino (Peru). T. spinosa is placed in the family Fabaceae, subfamily Caesalpinioideae, and tribe Caesalpinieae. Description T. spinosa typically grows 2‚Äì5 m tall; its bark is dark gray with scattered prickles and hairy twigs. Leaves are alternate, evergreen, lacking stipules, bipinnate, and lacking petiolar and rachis glands. Leaves consist of three to 10 pairs of primary leaflets under 8 cm in length, and five to seven pairs of subsessile elliptic secondary leaflets, each about 1.5‚Äì4 cm long. Inflorescences are 15‚Äì20 cm long terminal racemes, many flowered and covered in tiny hairs. Flowers are yellow to orange with 6- to 7-mm petals; the lowest sepal is boat-shaped with many long marginal teeth; stamens are yellow, irregular in length and barely protruding. The fruit is a flat, oblong indehiscent pod, about 6‚Äì12 cm long and 2.5 cm wide, containing four to seven round black seeds, which redden when mature.E. McClintock (1996). Caesalpinia. In: J.C. Hickman (ed.) The Jepson Manual: Higher Plants of California. University of California Press. Distribution and habitat T. spinosa is native to Peru and can be found growing throughout northern, western, and southern South America, from Venezuela to Argentina. It has been introduced in drier parts of Asia, the Middle East, and Africa and has become naturalized in California. T. spinosa grows in the nearly rainless lomas or fog oases of the Peruvian coastal desert.Zaro, Gregory (2007), \\"Diversity Specialists: Coastal Resource Management and Historical Contingency in the Osmore Desert of Southern Peru,\\" Latin American Antiquity, Vol. 18, No. 2, pp. 165‚Äì174 Generally resistant to most pathogens and pests, it grows at elevations between 0 and 3,000 m above sea level, and tolerates dry climates and poor soils, including those high in sand and rocks. To propagate, seeds must be scarified (treated to break physical dormancy), and young plants should be transplanted to the field at 40 cm in height; trees begin to produce after 4‚Äì5 years. Mature pods are usually harvested by hand and typically sun dried before processing. If well irrigated, trees can continue to produce for another 80 years, though their highest production is between 15 and 65 years of age.P. De la Cruz Lapa (2004). An integral and rational utility of tara (Caesalpinia spinosa-Caesalpinia tinctoria) Rev. Inst. investig. Fac. minas metal cienc. geogr. [online]. jul./dic. 2004, vol.7, no.14 [citado 27 Mayo 2008], p.64-73. <>. Uses=Industrial T. spinosa pods are an excellent source of environmentally friendly tannins (tara tannins) most commonly used in the manufacture of automotive and furniture leathers.J. C. Castell Escuer TARA (Caesalpinia spinosa): the sustainable source of tannins for innovative tanning processes. Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC). Barcelona, January 2012. This growing industry is developing around their production in Peru. Some producers have their own plantations to guarantee constant quality. Tara tannin derivatives are being proposed as antifouling against marine organisms that can grow on ship hulls.N. Bellotti, B. Del Amo, R. Romagnoli. Caesalpinia spinosa tannin derivatives for antifouling formulations. Procedia Materials Science, Volume 1, 2012, pp. 259-265. 11th International Congress on Metallurgy & Materials SAM/CONAMET 2011. Those tannins are of the hydrolysable type. Gallic acid is the main constituent of tara tannins (53%) and can be easily isolated by alkaline hydrolysis of the plant extract.J.M. Garro Galvez, B. Riedl and A. H. Conner (1997). Analytical Studies on Tara Tannins. Holzforschung 51: 235-243. Quinic acid is also a constituent of the tara tannins.S. Giovando, A. Pizzi, H. Pasch and N. Pretorius. Structure and Oligomers Distribution of Commercial Tara (Caesalpina spinosa) Hydrolysable Tannin. PRO LIGNO Vol. 9 N¬∞ 1 2013, pp. 22-31, ISSN-L 1841-4737, ONLINE ISSN 2069-7430. Its tannines are colourless or light making them suitable a premordant in the dyeing of cotton and other cellulose fibres.Donna Brown, Diane de Souza, and Catharine Ellis: Mordanting Cotton and Cellulose‚ÄîSuccessful Methods, Turkey Red Journal 19:1 (2014). The tree can also be a source of lumber and firewood, and as a live fence. The seeds can be used to produce black dye, while dark blue dye can be obtained from the roots. Food additive Tara gum is a white or beige, nearly odorless powder that is produced by separating and grinding the endosperm of T. spinosa seeds. Tara gum consists of a linear main chain of (1-4)-Œ≤-D-mannopyranose units attached by (1-6) linkages with Œ±-D-galactopyranose units.TARA GUM. Prepared at the 30th JECFA (1986), published in FNP 37 (1986) and in FNP 52 (1992). Metals and arsenic specifications revised at the 57th JECFA (2001). The major component of the gum is a galactomannan polymer similar to the main components of guar and locust bean gums that are used widely in the food industry. The ratio of mannose to galactose in tara gum is 3:1.W. Sittikijyothin, D. Torres, M.P. Gon√ßalves. Modelling the rheological behaviour of galactomannan aqueous solutions. Carbohydrate Polymers, Volume 59, Issue 3, pp 339‚Äì350, 18 February 2005. Tara gum has been deemed safe for human consumption as a food additive.J.F. Borzelleca, B.N. Ladu, F.R. Senti, and J.L. Egle, Jr. (1993). Evaluation of the Safety of Tara Gum as a Food Ingredient: A Review of the Literature. Journal of the American College of Toxicology 12: 81‚Äì89. Tara gum is used as a thickening agent and stabilizer in a number of food applications. A solution of tara gum is less viscous than a guar gum solution of the same concentration, but more viscous than a solution of locust bean gum. Generally, tara gum presents a viscosity around 5,500 cps (1% aqueous solution). Furthermore, tara gum shows an intermediate acid stability between locust bean gum and guar gum. It resists the depolymerisation effect of organic acids down to a pH of 3.5. This gum is also stable to high-temperature treatment, up to 145 ¬∞C in a continuous process plant. Blends of tara with modified and unmodified starches can be produced which have enhanced stabilization and emulsification properties, and these are used in the preparation of convenience foods, such as ice cream. One example is the American ice cream brand Breyers. The European food additive number for tara gum is E417. Tara gum is listed on the Canadian List of Permitted Emulsifying, Gelling, Stabilizing or Thickening Agents (Lists of Permitted Food Additives) as item T.2B. The Italian company Silvateam is a producer of tara gum for the food and beverage industries. Silvateam's website uses Caesalpinia spinosa as the Latin name of the plant, and notes that it is also called Peruvian carob. Silvateam encourages the use of tara gum in ice cream to provide \\"freeze-thaw stability by preventing the formation of ice crystals\\". Medicinal Medicinal uses in Peru include gargling infusions of the pods for inflamed tonsils or washing wounds; it is also used for fevers, colds, and stomach aches. Water from boiled, dried pods is also used to kill fleas and other insects.

It is one of the islands of the 21-island Isle-aux-Grues archipelago. It is part of the municipality of Saint-Antoine-de-l'Isle-aux-Grues, located in the Chaudi√®re-Appalaches region of the province. Also known as Grosse Isle and the Irish Memorial National Historic Site, the island was the site of an immigration depot which predominantly housed Irish immigrants coming to Canada to escape the Great Famine, 1845-1849. In 1832, the Lower Canadian Government had previously set up this depot to contain an earlier cholera epidemic that was believed to be caused by the large influx of European immigrants, and the station was reopened in the mid-Nineteenth Century to accommodate Irish migrants who had contracted typhus during their voyages. Thousands of Irish were quarantined on Grosse Isle from 1832 to 1848. It is believed that over 3000A. Charbonneau: Parks Canada Website , retrieved August 9, 2006 Irish died on the island and over 5000 are currently buried in the cemetery there; many died en route. Most who died on the island were infected with typhus, which sprang up from the conditions there in 1847. Grosse Isle is the largest burial ground for refugees of the Great Famine outside Ireland. After Canadian Confederation in 1867, the buildings and equipment were modernized to meet the standards of the new Canadian government's immigration policies.Moving Here, Staying Here: The Canadian Immigrant Experience at Library and Archives Canada The island is sometimes called Canada's Ellis Island (1892-1954), an association it shares with Pier 21 immigration facility in Halifax, Nova Scotia.Penelope Johnston, \\"Canada's Ellis Island\\", The Beaver, February - March 2009, p. 52-53. Steamer Lake Champlain arriving at port, Qu√©bec, Oct. 1911 It is estimated that in total, from when it was set up in 1832 to the closing in 1932, almost 500,000 Irish immigrants passed through Grosse Isle on their way to Canada.The Irish Exodus to Canada: Grosse Isle, 1847-8 Arrival On arrival at Grosse Isle, immigrant ships were not permitted to sail onwards unless they had assured the authorities that they were free of disease. Those with fever cases on board were required to fly a blue flag.The Toronto Star, 2 May 1992 Dr. George Douglas, Grosse Isle's chief medical officer, recorded that by mid-summer the quarantine regulations in force were 'physically impossible' to carry out, making it necessary for the emigrants to stay on board their ships for many days. Douglas believed that washing and airing out the ships would be enough to stop the contagion spreading between infected passengers.Cecil Woodham-Smith: The Great Hunger - Ireland 1845-1849, published by Penguin Books, 1991 edition Robert Whyte, pseudonymous author of the 1847 Famine Ship Diary: The Journey of a Coffin Ship,Robert Whyte's 1847 Famine Ship Diary: The Journey of an Irish Coffin Ship, published by Mercier Press, 1994 described how on arrival at Grosse Isle the Irish emigrant passengers on the Ajax dressed in their best clothes and helped the crew to clean the ship, expecting to be sent either to hospital or on to Quebec after their long voyage. In fact, the doctor inspected them only briefly and did not return for several days. By mid-summer doctors were examining their charges very perfunctorily, allowing them to walk past and examining the tongues of any who looked feverish. In this way, many people with latent fever were allowed to pass as healthy, only to succumb to their sickness once they had left Grosse Isle. On 28 July 1847, Whyte recorded the neglect of his fellow passengers, who 'within reach of help' 'were to be left enveloped in reeking pestilence, the sick without medicine, medical skill, nourishment, or so much as a drop of pure water'. However, conditions on other Irish emigrant ships were still worse. Two Canadian priests who visited the Ajax described the holds of other vessels where they had been 'up to their ankles in filth. The wretched emigrants crowded together like cattle and corpses remain[ed] long unburied'. Whyte contrasted this with the condition of German immigrants arriving at Grosse Isle. These were all free of sickness, 'comfortably and neatly clad, clean and happy'. The Times also commented on the 'healthy, robust and cheerful' Germans. The exact numbers of those who died at sea is unknown, although Whyte himself estimated it at 5293. During the crossing itself, bodies were thrown into the sea, but once the ships had reached Grosse Isle they were kept in the hold until a burial on land became possible. The dead were dragged out of the holds with hooks and 'stacked like cordwood' on the shore.The Great Shame by Thomas Keneally, published by Vintage in 1999 On July 29, 1847 Whyte described 'a continuous line of boats, each carrying its freight of dead to the burial ground... Some had several corpses so tied up in canvas that the stiff, sharp outline of death was easily traceable'. Even those passengers who escaped typhus and other diseases were weakened by the journey. The Senate Committee of the United States on Sickness and Mortality in Emigrant Ships described the newly disembarked emigrants as 'cadaverous' and 'feeble'. Most had been misled by passage-brokers into believing that they would be provided with food on the ship. Accommodation Before the 1847 crisis, invalids were placed in hospitals while the healthy carried out their quarantine periods in sheds. However, in 1847 the island was quickly overwhelmed. Tents were set up to house the influx of people, but many new arrivals were left lying on the ground without shelter. Robert Whyte records seeing 'hundreds... literally flung on the beach, left amid the mud and stones to crawl on the dry land as they could'. The Anglican Bishop of Montreal, Bishop Mountain, recalled seeing people lying opposite the church screaming for water, while others lay inside the tents without bedding. One child he saw was covered in vermin; another who had 'been walking with some others, sat down for a moment, and died'. Many children were orphaned. Accommodation was found in the sheds, which were filthy and crowded, with patients lying in double tiers of bunks which allowed dirt from the top bunk to fall onto the lower. According to the Senate Committee's report, two or three invalids would be placed together in one berth, irrespective of age or sex. There was no bread: meals consisted of tea, gruel or broth served three times a day.The Grosse √éle Tragedy by J. Jordan, 1909 As drinking water was carted, there was never enough for the fever patients. One Catholic priest, Father Moylan, reported giving water to invalids in a tent who had not been able to drink for 18 hours.Quebec Gazette, July 23, 1847 The sheds were not originally intended to house fever patients and had no ventilation; new sheds were built without privies. The Senate Committee stated that because of the lack of personnel and space, the invalids lay in their own excrement for days and there were insufficient staff to take away those who died during the night. The hospitals themselves had very little equipment and planks for bedding were not always available, meaning that it was spread on the ground and became soaked. At Quebec, the French and English speaking Catholic clergy ministered to the discharged emigrants and convalescents brought from the island. Father McMahon, founder of St. Patrick's Church (Quebec City), took a leading part in organizing relief to the sufferers and orphans of that awful period. Personnel As well as a shortage of accommodation, there was a serious lack of doctors. Dr. Douglas attempted to enlist nurses and doctors from among the healthy female passengers with the promise of high wages, but fear of disease meant none accepted. Nurses were expected to sleep alongside the sick and share their food; they had no privacy, often caught the fever themselves and were not helped when they fell ill. Prisoners from the local jail were released to carry out the nursing, but many stole from the dead and the dying.The Grosse √éle Tragedy by J. Jordan, 1909 All of the medical officers involved became ill at some stage, with four doctors dying of typhus. Under the Passenger Act of 1842, ships were not obliged to carry a doctor, and only two doctors arrived as passengers. One of these was a Dr. Benson from Dublin, a man with experience working in fever hospitals in Ireland. He arrived on May 21, volunteered to help the sick, contracted typhus himself and was dead within six days. More than forty Irish and French Canadian priests and Anglican clergymen were active on Grosse Isle, many becoming ill themselves. The Chief Pastor, Bishop Power, contracted fever and died after delivering the last sacraments to a dying woman in September. The Mayor of Montreal, John Easton Mills, also died in the course of caring for the sick.The Voyage of the Naparima by James Magnan, published by Carraig Books in 1982. Fate of immigrants after Grosse Isle The Black Rock, on the island of Montreal Many immigrants who passed the perfunctory quarantine checks at Grosse Isle fell sick soon afterwards. Some died in the camp for the 'healthy', tents on the eastern side of Grosse Isle. When a priest, Father O'Reilly, visited this area in August, he gave the last rites to fifty people. In the week leading up to August 18 alone, 88 deaths occurred among the 'healthy'. On June 8, Dr. Douglas warned the authorities of Quebec and Montreal that an epidemic was about to strike. On the previous Sunday between 4,000 and 5,000 'healthy' had left Grosse Isle, of whom Dr. Douglas estimated two thousand would develop fever within three weeks. Thousands were being discharged into Montreal, weak and helpless, some crawling because they could not walk, others 'lying on the wharves, dying'. Immigrants in Quebec were described as 'emaciated objects' huddled 'in the doors of churches, the wharves and the streets, apparently in the last stages of disease and famine'. From 1847 to 1848, an estimated 3,000 to 6,000 Irish died from ship fever in fever sheds set up at Windmill Point in Montreal. Their remains were discovered in 1859 by workers building the Victoria Bridge, who erected the Black Rock memorial in their honour. Its inscription reads: :\\"To preserve from desecration the remains of 6000 immigrants who died of ship fever A.D.1847-8 this stone is erected by the workmen of Messrs. Peto, Brassey and Betts employed in the construction of the Victoria Bridge A.D.1859.\\" Other cities, including Kingston and Toronto, were anxious to push immigrants on. Whyte recorded seeing one family sheltering under boards by the side of the road and commented that 'there is no means of learning how many of the survivors of so many ordeals were cut off by the inclemency of a Canadian winter'. One immigrant who did survive was the grandfather of Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company.BBC Guide to Irish Emigration Memorials A national memorial, the Celtic Cross, was unveiled on site on August 15, 1909.\\"Grosse Ile Cross Raised In Memory of Fever Victims. Pilgrimage planned for 25th Anniversary ...Some 18,000 Irish Immigrants died at sea...\\" May 25, 1934. Montreal Gazette newspaper. Designed by Jeremiah O'Gallagher, Country President of the Ancient Order of Hibernians at the time, the monument is the largest of its kind in North America. In 1974, the government of Canada declared the island a National Historic Site. A memorial was erected on the island in 1997. Timeline of the 1847 crisis This timeline has been derived from Cecil Woodham-Smith's work The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-1849, first published by Hamish Hamilton in 1962. February On February 19, the medical officer in charge of the quarantine station at Grosse Isle, Dr George M. Douglas, requested ¬£3,000 to assist with an expected influx of Irish immigrants. He was granted ¬£300, a small steamer and permission to hire a sailing vessel for not more than ¬£50. March Quebec citizens petitioned Earl Grey, Secretary of State for the Colonies, to take action in the face of the expected rise in immigration. April The Colonial Land and Emigration Commissioners published their seventh report without any mention of the approaching crisis. May Chief Emigration Officer Alexander Carlisle Buchanan failed to report concerns to the Canadian government because it was \\"not within the control of [his] department\\". Dr. Douglas, believing 10,600 emigrants had left Britain for Quebec since April 10, requested ¬£150 for a new fever shed. The authorities promised him ¬£135. Preparations were made for 200 invalids. On May 17 the first vessel, the Syria, arrived with 430 fever cases. This was followed by eight more ships a few days later. Dr Douglas wrote that he had 'not a bed to lay [the invalids] on... I never contemplated the possibility of every vessel arriving with fever as they do now'. One week later seventeen more vessels had appeared at Grosse Isle. By this time, 695 people were already in hospital. Only two days afterwards the number of vessels reached thirty, with 10,000 immigrants now waiting to be processed. By May 29, a total of 36 vessels had arrived. The end of May saw forty ships forming a line two miles (3 km) long down the St. Lawrence River. According to Dr Douglas, each one was affected by fever and dysentery. 1100 invalids were accommodated in sheds and tents, or laid out in rows in the church. Due to the lack of space on Grosse Isle, Dr. Douglas required healthy passengers to stay on ship for fifteen days once the sick had been removed, by way of quarantine. Infection flourished on board the ships. One ship, the Agnes, reached Grosse Isle with 427 passengers of whom only 150 survived the quarantine period. June On June 1, the Catholic archbishop of Quebec contacted all Catholic bishops and archbishops in Ireland, asking them to discourage their diocesans from emigrating. Despite this, of the 109,000 emigrants who had left for British North America, almost all were Irish. On June 5, 25,000 Irish immigrants were quarantined on Grosse Isle itself or waiting in the ships anchored nearby. July By mid-summer 2500 invalids were quarantined on Grosse Isle, and the line of waiting ships stretched several miles. At the end of the month, Dr. Douglas abandoned the quarantine regulations because they were 'impossible' to enforce. His new instructions were that the healthy would be released after a cursory check by the doctor. October Ice blocks the St. Lawrence and immigration ceases. 1848 to the present This information was taken from √éle of Irish Tears, an article appearing in the Toronto Star on 2 May 1992. 1862: A total of 59 casualties die on the island, 34 from typhus. Medical improvements, the abandonment of slow-sailing ships in favour of steam ships and tougher quarantine regulations helped slow the spread of disease. 1870 - 1880: Only 42 deaths are reported on Grosse Isle during this decade. 1880 - 1932: Grosse Isle continues to act as a quarantine station against typhus, cholera, beriberi, smallpox and bubonic plague. 1909: The Ancient Order of Hibernians in America set up a Celtic cross with inscriptions in Irish, English and French, in memory of those who died during 1847 and 1848. 1932: Grosse Isle ceases to be a quarantine station. By this time, immigrants are arriving at many different ports and the city hospitals are capable of dealing with them. 1939 - 1945 (approx): Used by the Department of National Defence to research bacteriological warfare, including the manufacture of anthrax. 1956: Taken over by Agriculture Canada for quarantining animals. 1974: Declared a National Historic Site by the Canadian government. 1993: Grosse Isle becomes a national historic park operated by Parks Canada. 1997: A memorial is erected in memory of those who died on the island.The Toronto Star, 2 May 1992. Irish Memorial National Historic Site Visitors can tour many of the buildings used for the immigrants and by the islanders. The disinfection building features the original showers, waiting rooms and steam disinfection apparatus, as well as a multimedia exhibit about the island's history. A walking trail or trolley are available for visits of the village and hospital sector, including the 1847 lazaretto (quarantine station), Catholic chapel, Anglican chapel, the superintendent‚Äôs gardens, the eastern wharf and a transport museum. In season, costumed interpreters portray various islanders, such as the quarantine station's staff, the nurse, Catholic priest, carter and school teacher. The lazaretto features an exhibit about the tragic experiences of the immigrants in 1847. A walking trail leads to the Celtic cross and the Irish Memorial, which honours the memory of the immigrants, the employees of the quarantine station, the sailors, the doctors and the priests who perished on this island. Grosse √éle and the Irish Memorial National Historic Site were twinned on May 25, 1998, with the National Famine Museum in Strokestown, Ireland.http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/lhn-nhs/qc/grosseile/natcul/natcul1.aspx Notes References  * O'Gallagher, Marianna, Rose Masson Dompierre (1995).

Toronto Nomads Club on Nomads Day 2014 at Fletcher's Fields. The Toronto Nomads Rugby Club is one of Canada's oldest rugby clubs. The Toronto Nomads are one of six clubs that formed the Toronto Rugby Union and the Ontario Rugby Union in 1950. Training in downtown Toronto, the Toronto Nomads boast three senior men's teams, one senior women's and seven junior squads, running from minis to U18. The senior men's team currently play in the Marshall Championship, the senior division of Ontario Rugby Union. Nomads history=Club founding In August 1950, Reverend Freddie Miller, along with an ad hoc Rugby Strategy Committee, began recruiting rugby players at the Canadian National Exhibition. Shortly after this recruitment push, 80 rugby players and rugby enthusiasts met at the Pine Room of the 48th Highlanders Memorial Hall. The group divided into three teams: The Nomads (led by Reverend Freddie Miller), the Wanderers and the Barbarians. Almost seven decades later, the three teams continue to play against each other (along with numerous other Ontario rugby clubs, which have sprung up since the 1950s). Nags The Nomads Acting Group (NAGs) was created by a handful of Nomads players who were homesick for the theatre they had grown up performing and enjoying before moving to Canada. The first performances put on by The Nomads were \\"Cupid is a Bum, Is a Bum, Is a Bum\\" and \\"Meet the Folks\\" on April Fools' Day, 1976 at the Tranzac Club in the Annex. The plays were such a huge success that the NAGs still put on shows today, including a winter British-style pantomime, as well as annual spring and a fall shows. Nomads elite players=Active players The Nomads have produced a number of elite players including Kelly Russell, Laura Russell and Lucas Hammond. All three play for Canada's professional senior teams with Laura Russell captaining the Senior Women's 15s team to silver during the 2014 Women's Rugby World Cup. Her sister, Kelly Russell, plays number four for Canada's Senior Women's 7s team when they took gold at the 2015 Pan Am competition. Kelly Russell will be representing Canada at the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics where she will be playing for Canada's 7s team. Retired players In 1995 Ian Gough played lock for the Nomads before going on to play professionally for Wales. Season and training The Nomads are one-sixth owners of Fletcher's Fields, the premier rugby facility in Ontario, Canada, located north of the city of Toronto. Their home games are played at Fletcher's while training takes place in downtown Toronto. Unlike almost all other (northern hemisphere) rugby countries, the Ontario rugby season runs from May until November. The sub-zero temperatures during the winter make playing and training outdoors impossible. The Nomads run an indoor touch session on Saturdays throughout the winter months. Their junior training programs also run throughout the winter.  Recruitment  The Toronto Nomads are an all-welcoming club. All players who turn up to training and pay their annual fees get game time on Saturdays. Fees do not have to be paid until matches commence in April, however some pre-season training will carry a small weekly fee for indoor location hire. In addition to The Nomads' locally developed players, each season sees an increase in foreign-based players, predominantly from Ireland, the UK, Australia and New Zealand. Other nationalities currently represented at the club include Argentina, France, the US, and Zimbabwe. Although in more traditional rugby countries it is not uncommon for players to be paid, this is not the case in Canada.

Magic Cristian, June 2012 He is best known for being 'Magic' Cristian, the touring keyboardist and background singer for the rock band Cheap Trick.  Pre Cheap Trick  After relocating to Los Angeles from Fresno, Ca in 1973 he was hired by a high-profile cover band Corroboree. After a number of years in the thriving local club scene they disbanded, with Cristian and two other band mates forming the band Fortress. Record labels Chrysalis and MCA showed interest in the band and they recorded a demo paid for by MCA. MCA eventually passed on the band due to the emergence of the 80's Punk and New Wave scene. Fortress went on to be a popular cover band, which shortly before disbanding in 1981 hired Mark Norton (aka Mark St. John) on guitar. Norton and Cristian then went on to form the band Front Page. On one of the bands Orange County club dates, members of the Micki Free band were in the audience and expressed interest in Cristian becoming their keyboard player for an upcoming tour. Cristian auditioned and was chosen to be a member of the Micki Free Band for the tour. They were managed by Diana Ross and produced by Gene Simmons of Kiss. The Micki Free Band, which also featured bassist Jon Brant, toured with Diana Ross as her opening act in late 1981. Norton went on to become the guitarist for Kiss for a short time in 1984 and died April 5, 2007.  With Cheap Trick 1982 - 1985  Jon Brant subsequently went on to join Cheap Trick following the departure of bassist Tom Petersson and when the group expressed interest in having a touring keyboardist, Brant submitted Cristian's name. Cristian received a call from the band's manager Ken Adamany in 1982 and flew to Chicago for an audition. After the audition, Cristian and the band flew back to California as Cheap Trick were filming videos for the One On One album in Los Angeles.

History Entrance to the roller coaster. Rattlesnake is a steel wild mouse style roller coaster ride which opened in 1998 at Chessington World of Adventures Resort as the theme park's third coaster. It was designed by Ing.-B√ºro Stengel GmbH, and manufactured by Maurer S√∂hne / Wilde Maus Classic. it is over 1000 feet long. Due to local planning restrictions (a result of the park being on green belt land ) the land designated for the ride area was excavated, resulting in the ride being partially submerged below ground level. The layout consists of a steep lift hill, sharp turns and small airtime hills. The Rattlesnake is themed around a Mexican mine of the Wild West era, with the cars resembling mine carts and a number of wooden structures and animated figures. The installation of the ride prompted the renaming of the park's 'Calamity Canyon' area to 'Mexicana', which remains today. ;Ride Rattlesnake starts with a large climb up a 45 degree angle lift hill. Once disengaging from the chain you turn right and continue to snake your way down a length of slightly sloped track making 180 degree turns every now and then. Then you travel around an elongated 270 degree right hand turn into a straight. You go up a small slope and then into some brakes. A 180 degree turn follows with a large drop down and up. Another 180 degree right hand turn follows into a number of air time hills into a building themed to look damaged at which point the on ride photo is taken. You then travel through another 180 degree turn into another air time hill before going into the final set of brakes which will halt you hard. Restrictions Rattlesnake has a height restriction: minimum 1.4 metres, maximum 1.96 metres. There are also chest restrictions for waist measurements 51 inches or above. However, if the lap-bar cannot fit over one's legs, then one cannot ride as they cannot be kept restrained. The ride is quite rough and jerky, and therefore anyone with back and neck problems cannot ride.

James (1780 ‚Äì 28 May 1827) was a British lawyer and military historian who wrote important histories of the military engagements of the British with the French and Americans from 1793 through the 1820s. Career Although little is known of his early life, William James was trained in the law and began his career as an attorney. He practised before the Supreme Court of Jamaica and served as a proctor in the Vice-Admiralty Court of Jamaica from 1801 to 1813. In 1812, when war broke out between Great Britain and the United States, James was in the United States. Detained by American authorities as a British national, he escaped to Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1813. This experience interested him in the War of 1812 and he began to write about it, particularly defending the reputation of the Royal Navy and pointing out the factual errors and excessive claims that American reports made against the Royal Navy. His initial literary efforts seem to have been letters written to the editor of the Naval Chronicle under the pen name 'Boxer'. In 1816, he published his first pamphlet, An inquiry into the merits of the principal naval actions between Great Britain and the United States. This pamphlet caused a controversy in the United States, leading to much American criticism of James's views. James went on to write his six-volume Naval History of Great Britain, 1793 ‚Äì 1827 in reaction to American accounts of the War of 1812. Similar in approach, this work was highly critical of the history that his contemporary Captain Edward Pelham Brenton had written on the subject and led to controversy between them that is reflected in successive editions of their works. James's legal background would influence his approach to obtaining evidence. He attempted, therefore, and managed to board American warships and speak to their crews, to verify their characteristics at first hand. In this pursuit he noted, for example, that the USS Constitution was not only much larger, but also more heavily manned and armed, than ‚Äì contrary to previous American claims that the ships had been equal at the time of their engagement. More alleged erroneous American assertions were dealt with. Equally, James was not shy to criticise British officers as well, where he saw fit.Lambert (2004), pp. I-II James died in South Lambeth, London, in 1827, but his works continued to be published. Captain Frederick Chamier expanded the work in 1837 to include the Burmese War and the Battle of Navarino. The book remained a major reference work and was so often consulted that the Navy Records Society published an index to the history in 1895, which is now available on the Internet. Debate Theodore Roosevelt, as a young Harvard University undergraduate in 1876‚Äì77, began work on a response from the American perspective. Published in 1882 as The Naval War of 1812, the book took James to task for what Roosevelt perceived as glaring mistakes and outright misrepresentations of fact based on malicious anti-American bias and shabby research, despite James's painstaking research and primary sources. In places, Roosevelt becomes almost mocking in his criticism of James. The books conclusions have been disputed by Professor Andrew Lambert in his 2012 book The Challenge: Britain Against America in the Naval War of 1812. Scholars further note that Roosevelt's effort did not actually refer to James's two books on the War of 1812. Instead, Roosevelt referred to James's Naval History series, which holds only a shortened version. This avoidance of James's arguments and detailed evidence of 1817 and 1818 is seen by some as largely undermining Roosevelt's critique of James's work. Moreover, Roosevelt is also accused of ignoring the earlier American claims that provoked James‚Äô errors in the first place, claims that might be best understood to be beneficial to American morale at the time.Lambert (2004), p. v James's primary conclusion ‚Äì that no American vessel of equal force ever captured a British ship ‚Äì essentially remains unchallenged.Lambert (2004), p. II Ian W. Toll's Six Frigates, published in 2006, cites Roosevelt's purpose as not only revealing James' distortions and fabrications but also showing James' American contemporaries as being equally guilty of being culpable of the same distortions and fabrications. In his book Roosevelt stated: :\\"And it must always be remembered that a victory, honourably won, if even over a weaker foe, does reflect credit on the nation by whom it is gained. It was creditable to us as a nation that our ships were better made and better armed then the British frigates....Some of my countrymen will consider this but scant approbation, to which the answer must be that a history is not a panegyric.\\"Toll (2006) p.464.

The film stars Barbara Stanwyck, Barry Sullivan and Gene Barry. Plot In the 1880s, Griff Bonnell, and his brothers, Wes and Chico, arrive in the town of Tombstone in Cochise County, Arizona. Griff is a reformed gunslinger, now working for the Attorney General's office, looking to arrest Howard Swain for mail robbery. Swain is one of landowner Jessica Drummond's forty hired guns. She runs the territory with an iron fist, permitting the town to be terrorized and trashed by her brother, Brockie Drummond, and his boys. Brockie is an arrogant drunk and bully, but he goes too far by shooting vision-impaired town Marshal, Chisolm in the leg. Thereupon, Brockie and his drunken friends start trashing the town. Griff intervenes and pistol-whips Brockie with a single blow while Wes covers him with a rifle from the gunsmith shop. Aware of how close Brockie is to his sister, Griff makes it a point not to crack Brockie's skull. Jessica delivered Brockie when their mother gave birth for the last time. Wes falls in love with Louvenie Spanger, the daughter of the town gunsmith, so he decides to settle down and become the town's marshal. Griff becomes romantically involved with Jessica after she is dragged by a horse during a tornado. Two of Jessica's forty dragoons, Logan, and Savage, attempt an ambush of Griff in an alley. He is saved by youngest brother Chico, who was supposed to be leaving for California for a new life on a farm. Chico's shot kills Savage, after which Jessica's brother and hired guns try to turn the town against the Bonnell brothers. On his wedding day, Wes is gunned down by Brockie, who is really aiming at Griff (who leans forward to kiss the bride, thereby unknowingly saving himself). Brockie is jailed for the murder. He tries to escape by using his sister as a shield, daring Griff to shoot, and is shocked when Griff does exactly that. Griff's expertly-placed bullet merely wounds Jessica, and the cowardly Brockie then becomes the first man Griff has had to kill in ten years. Brockie's last words are \\"Mr. Bonnell, I'm killed!\\" Chico remains behind to take the marshal's job. Griff rides out, certain that Jessica hates him for killing her brother, but she runs down the dirt street after his buckboard - repeatedly calling out \\"Griff! Mr. Bonnell!\\" - and they appear to ride off together for California.

An intensive care unit (ICU), also known as an intensive therapy unit or intensive treatment unit (ITU) or critical care unit (CCU), is a special department of a hospital or health care facility that provides intensive care medicine. Intensive care units cater to patients with severe or life-threatening illnesses and injuries, which require constant care, close supervision from life support equipment and medication in order to ensure normal bodily functions. They are staffed by highly trained physicians, nurses and respiratory therapists who specialize in caring for critically ill patients. ICUs are also distinguished from general hospital wards by a higher staff-to-patient ratio and access to advanced medical resources and equipment that is not routinely available elsewhere. Common conditions that are treated within ICUs include acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock and other life-threatening conditions. Patients may be referred directly from an emergency department or from a ward if they rapidly deteriorate, or immediately after surgery if the surgery is very invasive and the patient is at high risk of complications.  History  In 1854, Florence Nightingale left for the Crimean War, where triage was used to separate seriously wounded soldiers from those with non-life-threatening conditions. Until recently, it was reported that Nightingale reduced mortality from 40% to 2% on the battlefield. Although this was not the case, her experiences during the war formed the foundation for her later discovery of the importance of sanitary conditions in hospitals, a critical component of intensive care. In 1950, anesthesiologist Peter Safar established the concept of advanced life support, keeping patients sedated and ventilated in an intensive care environment. Safar is considered to be the first practitioner of intensive care medicine as a speciality. In response to a polio epidemic (where many patients required constant ventilation and surveillance), Bj√∏rn Aage Ibsen established the first intensive care unit in Copenhagen in 1953.. Translation of introduction available here . The first application of this idea in the United States was in 1955 by William Mosenthal, a surgeon at the Dartmouth- Hitchcock Medical Center. In the 1960s, the importance of cardiac arrhythmias as a source of morbidity and mortality in myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) was recognized. This led to the routine use of cardiac monitoring in ICUs, especially after heart attacks.  Staffing  * Most studies addressing staffing of ICUs have had significant limitations, and this literature does not yet provide a consistent view of the best model to use. This subject is complicated by the fact that optimal ICU staffing may depend on ICU characteristics. * Despite calls for all ICUs to function as closed-model units with intensivists as the primary physician of record, evidence supporting this view is contradictory. Likewise, studies of around-the-clock intensivist presence have not consistently shown that it is associated with superior outcomes. * The data do not supply a consistent answer to the question of whether ICUs would obtain better outcomes if they added nurses to reduce their patient:nurse ratios. * Increasingly, nonphysician providers are playing innovative roles in the ICU, and care provided by teams including nurse practitioners or physician assistants appears to be safe and comparable to that provided by other staffing models. * The conditions of ICU staffing will continue to change under the stresses of shortages of a variety of health care workers relevant to ICU care, and increasing duty hour limitations for physician trainees. Nonphysician providers, innovative staffing models, telemedicine, and other technologies will be increasingly used to cope with these realities. * Since only quantitative evaluation can tell us whether one staffing model is better than another, we need more research from multiple sites to develop a consistent and integrated understanding of this complex topic. Specialities US Army ICU nurse attending to a patient in Baghdad, Iraq ICU nurses monitoring patients from a central computer station. This allows for rapid intervention should a patient's condition deteriorate whilst a member of staff is not immediately at the bedside. Nurses in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) Hospitals may have ICUs that cater to a specific medical requirement or patient, such as those listed below: * Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). This specialty unit cares for neonatal patients who have not left the hospital after birth. Common conditions cared for include prematurity and associated complications, congenital disorders such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia, or complications resulting from the birthing process. * Pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Pediatric patients are treated in this intensive care unit for life-threatening conditions such as asthma, influenza, diabetic ketoacidosis, or traumatic neurological injury. Surgical cases may also be referred to the PICU postoperatively if the patient has a potential for rapid deterioration or if the patient requires monitoring, such as spinal infusions or surgeries involving the respiratory system such as removal of the tonsils or adenoids. Some facilities also have specialized pediatric cardiac intensive care units, for patients with congenital heart disease are treated. These units also typically cater for cardiac transplantation and postoperative cardiac catheterization patients if those services are offered at the hospital. * Geriatric intensive-care unit (GICU), a special intensive care unit dedicated to management of critically ill elderly. * Psychiatric intensive care unit (PsICU). Patients who may voluntarily harm themselves are brought here for more vigorous monitoring. * Coronary care unit (CCU): Also known as Cardiac Intensive Care Units (CICU) or Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit (CVICU), this ICU caters to patients specifically with congenital heart defects or life-threatening cardiac conditions such as a myocardial infarction or a cardiac arrest. * Neurological Intensive Care Unit (NeuroICU). Patients are treated for brain aneurysms, brain tumors, stroke, rattlesnake bites and post surgical patients who have undergone various neurological surgeries performed by experienced neurosurgeons require constant neurological exams. Nurses who work within these units have neurological certifications. Once the patients are stable and removed from the ventilator, they are transferred to a neurological care unit. * Traumatic Intensive Care Unit (TICU). These are found in hospitals certified in treating traumatic injuries/illnesses requiring a dedicated Trauma Emergency team equipped with the expertise to deal with serious complications. A traumatic specialist team includes surgeons, nurses, respiratory therapists, and radiological staff. * Post-anesthesia care unit (PACU): Also known as the post-operative recovery unit, or recovery room, the PACU provides immediate post-op observation and stabilisation of patients following surgical operations and anesthesia. Patients are usually held in such facilities for a limited amount of time and have to meet set physiological aspects before being transferred back to a ward with a qualified nurse escort. Owing to high patient flow in recovery units, and to the bed management cycle, if a patient breaches a time frame and is too unstable to be transferred back to a ward, they are normally transferred to a high dependency unit (HDU) or post- operative critical care unit (POCCU) in order to receive progressive treatment. * High dependency unit (HDU): In the United Kingdom and elsewhere (known as step down unit or progressive care unit in North America), most acute hospitals have a transitional high dependency unit (HDU) for patients who require close observation, treatment and nursing care that cannot be provided in a general ward, but whose care is not at a critical stage to warrant an (ICU) bed. These units are also called step-down or progressive intensive recovery units and are utilised until a patient's condition stabilizes to qualify for discharge to a general ward or recovery unit. * Surgical intensive care unit (SICU): Also known as the surgery critical care unit, the SICU is a specialized service in larger hospitals that provides inpatient care for critically ill patients on surgical services. As opposed to other ICUs, the care is managed by surgeons or anesthesiologists trained in critical-care.  Mobile ICU  MICU of the university hospital in Antwerp, Belgium *Mobile intensive care unit (MICU) A specialized ambulance with the team and equipment to provide on-scene Advanced Life Support and intensive care during transportation. These type of ICUs are generally used for people who are being transferred from hospitals and from home to a hospital. In the Anglo American model of pre-hospitalisation care MICUs are generally crewed by (ECT practitioners) or advanced life support paramedics. In the European model, Mobile ICU teams are usually managed by a critical care nurse and an emergency medicine physician/medical doctor (M.D). Equipment and systems Common equipment in an ICU includes mechanical ventilators to assist breathing through an endotracheal tube or a tracheostomy tube; cardiac monitors for monitoring Cardiac condition; equipment for the constant monitoring of bodily functions; a web of intravenous lines, feeding tubes, nasogastric tubes, suction pumps, drains, and catheters, syringe pumps; and a wide array of drugs to treat the primary condition(s) of hospitalization. Medically induced comas, analgesics, and induced sedation are common ICU tools needed and used to reduce pain and prevent secondary infections. Quality of care The available data suggests a relation between ICU volume and quality of care for mechanically ventilated patients. After adjustment for severity of illnesses, demographic variables, and characteristics of different ICUs (including staffing by intensivists), higher ICU staffing was significantly associated with lower ICU and hospital mortality rates. A ratio of 2 patients to 1 nurse is recommended for a medical ICU, which contrasts to the ratio of 4:1 or 5:1 typically seen on medical floors. This varies from country to country, though; e.g., in Australasia and the United Kingdom, most ICUs are staffed on a 2:1 basis (for high-dependency patients who require closer monitoring or more intensive treatment than a hospital ward can offer) or on a 1:1 basis for patients requiring extreme intensive support and monitoring; for example, a patient on a mechanical ventilator with associated anaesthetics or sedation such as propofol, midazolam and use of strong analgesics such as morphine, fentanyl and/or remifentanil. International guidelines recommend that every patient gets checked for delirium every day (usually twice or as much required) using a validated clinical tool. The two most widely used are the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) and the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). There are translations of these tools in over 20 languages and they are used globally in many ICU's. Operational logistics In the United States, up to 20% of hospital beds can be labelled as intensive-care beds; in the United Kingdom, intensive care usually will comprise only up to 2% of total beds. This high disparity is attributed to admission of patients in the UK only when considered the most severely ill. Intensive care is an expensive healthcare service. A recent study conducted in the United States found that hospital stays involving ICU services were 2.5 times more costly than other hospital stays. In the United Kingdom in 2003‚Äì04, the average cost of funding an intensive care unit was: * ¬£838 per bed per day for a neonatal intensive care unit * ¬£1,702 per bed per day for a pediatric intensive care unit * ¬£1,328 per bed per day for an adult intensive care unit Remote collaboration systems Some hospitals have installed teleconferencing systems that allow doctors and nurses at a central facility (either in the same building, at a central location serving several local hospitals, or in rural locations another more urban facility) to collaborate with on-site staff and speak with patients (a form of telemedicine). This is variously called an eICU, virtual ICU, or tele-ICU. Remote staff typically have access to vital signs from live monitoring systems, and telectronic health records so they may have access to a broader view of a patient's medical history. Often bedside and remote staff have met in person and may rotate responsibilities. Such systems are beneficial to intensive care units in order to ensure correct procedures are being followed for patients vulnerable to deterioration, to access vital signs remotely in order to keep patients that would have to be transferred to a larger facility if need be he/she may have demonstrated a significant decrease in stability.

Soldiers and civilians pose near the Lion of Saint Mark at the entrance to the Caserma Caserma Ederle (Camp Ederle) is a military complex in Vicenza, Italy, where the United States Army has troops stationed. It is under Italian military control and can be managed anytime by the Italian authorities.http://www.carabinieri.it/editoria/rassegna-dell- arma/la-rassegna/anno-2011/n-3---luglio-settembre/studi/le-basi-militari- alleate-in-italia-aspetti-di-rilevanza-per-l-attivit%C3%A0-di-polizia-militare The Vicenza Military Community is composed of soldiers, family members, civilians and retirees with a small number of airmen and sailors also stationed there. The base serves as the headquarters of United States Army Africa and the 173rd Airborne Brigade. Caserma Ederle serves as the headquarters of U.S. Army Garrison Vicenza of the United States Army Installation Management Command, an umbrella for all U.S. military properties in Vicenza. The base is named after Major Carlo Ederle, an Italian hero of World War I and recipient of the French Croix de Guerre (French War Cross), among other military honors.  Garrison  The current formations which form part of the camp include: * United States Army Africa Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion * 509th Signal Battalion * 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team * 14th Transportation Battalion * Detachment E, 106th Finance Management Company * U.S. Army Health Clinic/Dental Clinic ‚Äì Vicenza  Life on the Caserma (camp)  Soldiers assigned to a tour of duty at Caserma Ederle are normally permitted to bring family members when being reassigned there upon a Permanent Change of Station. Still, many of the military personnel assigned to Caserma Ederle are unaccompanied. The post offers virtually all of the standard amenities present on most U.S. military installations, such as a Post Exchange, commissary, theater, etc. Single or unaccompanied junior enlisted soldiers live primarily in barracks located on the post itself, or in leased government quarters in the local community. Depending on the availability of housing upon arrival, personnel accompanied by dependents can live in housing quarters, Italian houses rented by the U.S. Government, government-owned housing units, or on the economy. Government-owned housing units for accompanied soldiers and their dependents are located in a separate and gated/secure area of Vicenza known as Villaggio della Pace (literally \\"Village of the Peace\\", but actually named after the street passing near the village and the camp - Viale della Pace). Single officers live on the economy.  History =1955‚Äì1990 Camp Ederle In 1951, the U.S. and Italy signed an agreement that the U.S. would operate lines of communication across Italy, and that the U.S. would occupy land near Livorno. This land became Camp Darby, located in Pisa, named for Brigadier General William O. Darby, who was killed in action in northern Italy on 30 April 1945. In 1955, all U.S. occupation forces in Austria were withdrawn upon the entry into force of the Austrian State Treaty. Under provisions of the agreement with Italy, Camp Darby was the initial reception station for soldiers, equipment and supplies returning from Austria. With Austria now neutral, northern Italy's eastern flank became vulnerable to attack. To reduce the danger in that area, the U.S. agreed to establish a force there and on 2 October 1955, the U.S. Army Southern European Task Force (SETAF) was activated. SETAF's first headquarters was on Camp Darby, but the largest number of soldiers has always been in Vicenza, Italy. Shortly after activation, USASETAF headquarters moved to Verona, Italy. Troop strength reached 10,000 and USASETAF was formally established via a U.S.-Italian agreement. In 1959, following President Dwight D. Eisenhower's visit to Rome, a third agreement brought significant changes to USASETAF. Italy's military forces were re-established. As a result, U.S. troop strength was cut in half; equipment from disbanded U.S. units was turned over to Italy; and Italian Army personnel were assigned to the USASETAF general staff to assist with unique bi-national responsibilities. As a result of this agreement, the 62nd Engineers and an artillery company were moved to Caserma Passalacqua. Both companies had nuclear weapons. The artillery company's Sergeant missiles had nuclear warheads and the engineering company was an ADM (Atomic Demolition Munitions) engineering unit. The headquarters moved again in 1965 from Verona to Caserma Ederle. Caserma Ederle had already existed as an Italian post. Soldier strength dropped to 2,500 in 1970 and civilian employment went down 70 percent in a unilateral cost-reduction effort. The port opened by 8th Area Support Group in Livorno was returned to Italian control. On 20 October 1963, the 5th Battalion (Sergeant Missile), 30th Field Artillery was activated in Caserma Ederle. LTC Ronald L. Little assumed command of the 5th Battalion, which consisted of A, B, and Headquarters batteries. The 5th Battalion, 30th Field Artillery was inactivated on 15 December 1975. SETAF's mission and geographical area of responsibility increased in 1972 when the command enlarged its signal support unit and took control of the 558th U.S. Army Artillery Group (USAAG) in Greece and the 528th USAAG in Turkey. These units had been in support of NATO since the early 1960s, along with the 559th USAAG, which had been a USASETAF unit in Italy since 1964. The 509th Infantry Regiment (Airborne Battalion Combat Team - ABCT) was previously placed under the command of SETAF in 1973 and later inactivated in the mid-1980s; it was replaced by the 4th Battalion, 325th Infantry Regiment. The 4/325th ABCT was composed of three line companies (including a COHORT company) Alpha, a headquarters company, a combat-support company, and a 105mm artillery battery. A member of NATO's Allied Mobile Forces (Land), the 4/325th ABCT was the right flank element of the European front during the late Cold War and was deployable by parachute to anywhere in the region. 3/325th Infantry (Airborne Battalion Combat Team) The 3/325 ABCT (Blue Falcons), occupied Caserma Ederle during the late 1980s as a contingent of the Army's Southern European Task Force. The 3/325 ABCT specialized in airfield seizures, and one of the most likely deployment scenarios during the Cold War was to attack and gain control of an airfield behind enemy lines of the USSR to provide a point into which more forces from the U.S. could build a stronghold. They trained extensively in cold weather tactics and operations in a specialized base in Folgaria, Italy. They deployed annually to train in Turkey, usually as part of joint operations training among other airborne units within SETAF, to include the British, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Turkish, etc. They also trained extensively in Grafenw√∂hr, West Germany. The 3/325th was also trained as a Military Operations in Urban Terrain unit. The primary missions of SETAF during the 1980s were the defense of the eastern Alpine passes in anticipation of a Soviet invasion, and command/control of the nuclear weapons stockpiles still located in northern Italy. Also stationed here was the 45th Field Hospital, US Army Medical Activity (USAMEDDAC), part of the 7th Medical Command. The 45th Field Hospital was a 26-bed hospital supporting the troops stationed at Caserma Ederle. The health clinic at Camp Darby, Livorno, was supported by the 45th Field Hospital as well as the health clinic at Sinop, Turkey. 1990s‚ÄìPresent The 1st Battalion, 508th Infantry Regiment was stationed at Caserma Ederle from April 1996 until it was reflagged as the 1st Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment in June 2006. Until 1992, USASETAF was considered a logistical command. In addition to the infantry units, SETAF operated a major depot at Camp Darby in conjunction with the 8th Area Support Group. With its designation as a support command and later a theater army area command, USASETAF was to be responsible for the reception, preparation for combat, and onward movement of forces entering the southern region for general war. The political reorientation of Europe in 1989 and 1990 resulting from the end of the Cold War caused major revision of U.S. and NATO military priorities. With the drastic reduction of the threat of general war, SETAF received new missions for regional tactical operations as command and control headquarters for U.S. Army and joint units. Its three artillery groups were inactivated and the two support groups became support groups with unique missions. The 8th Area Support Group's depot operation developed into the maintenance and issue of theater reserve stocks organized in unit sets sufficient to fully equip a heavy brigade. 3/325 Infantry ABCT, Caserma Ederele, Vicenza, Italy The 3rd Battalion of the 325th Regiment also served during this period and were successful in the campaign of \\"Operation Provide Comfort\\", during the first Gulf War in Iraq. They were commanded by Lieutenant Colonel (later General) John P. Abizaid, who later commanded U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) from July 2003 to March 2007. A reorganization to command structure created USAG (United States Army Garrison)-Vicenza to handle the (non-combatant forces) installation activities of Caserma Ederle.  Dal Molin/Del Din Planned Post Annex  Camp Del Din 173rd Airborne Brigade, Italy In 2004, the U.S. military announced plans to extend the military footprint in Vicenza to include all elements of the 173rd ABCT. The new base annex was planned to be located on the disused civilian Dal Molin Airport, roughly from Caserma Ederle. The plan was first agreed by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's administration. The succeeding government, led by Romano Prodi, initially opposed the expansion, but eventually agreed to the extension plan. The Italian Ministry of Defense has announced the redesignation of the installation from Dal Molin to Caserma Del Din upon transfer to the Italian Army. The work is managed by the Transition Construction Management Office and construction oversight is by the Naval Facilities Engineer Command, Resident Officer in Charge of Construction. On October 30, 2012 during a special ceremony in Rome honoring Paolo Costa, the U.S. Ambassador David Thorne credited the success of Del Din to the strong support that the United States received from the highest levels of the Italian government, including the executive, legislative and judicial branches over several years and by several different governments. This facility will be the first DoD installation to obtain the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver certification with the potential to achieve gold certification. Vicenza is eventually slated to be home to the 173rd Airborne Brigade and the United States Army Africa headquarters. Currently, only two infantry battalions and portions of the brigade's two support battalions are in Vicenza, and the move would bring the total number of stationed troops in Vicenza to 5,000.  Camp Darby  In 2012 the US Army announced that USAG Livorno/Camp Darby will be downgraded from a US Army Garrison (USAG) to a sub-Garrison called Darby Military Community reporting to USAG Vicenza at Caserma Ederle.

If the service was only in the Vermont National Guard, they must have been activated during a conflict or be retired. The medal was established in 1999, but is retroactively available to veterans of prior military service. The Vermont Veterans Medal is a state award, presented by the Vermont Department of Veterans Affairs. U.S. military active duty regulations allow their members to accept but not wear state awards. In addition, activated National Guard members may not wear their state awards while serving in Title 10 (federal) status. Eligibility # Must have been a Vermont resident when entered military; or be a current Vermont resident; or be a member of a reserve or guard unit stationed in Vermont. # Received an honorable discharge, unless died prior to separation. # If national guard/reserve service only, must have been brought on active duty during a period of conflict or must have retired. Description Following is the blazon narrative describing the Vermont Veterans Medal: The ribbons of the Vermont medals for veterans contain the four primary colors of the Coat of arms of Vermont: red, yellow, blue and green. The alternating red and yellow at the center of the ribbon loosely parallels the design and colors of the National Defense Service Medal, which is presented to military members with service during a time of conflict. Field of azure blue encompasses the red and yellow, symbolizing the honor of military service. Next, fields of green represent Vermont, the Green Mountain State, which reminds us that service to our nation is also service to the citizens of our state. The edges of this ribbon are bordered in yellow. In the Vermont Coat of Arms, bundles of wheat are shown in yellow. In this ribbon, they represent the protection offered our state by nature‚Äôs bounty. The medal is cast in bronze, with the coat of arms of Vermont on the obverse and the Great Seal of Vermont on the reverse. Across the top is inscribed ‚ÄúVermont National Defense,‚Äù uniting the interests of our state with our nation. The year ‚Äú1777‚Äù is inscribed at the bottom, indicating the year of the Battle of Bennington where Vermonters first took arms to defend their state in war, and the year of the founding of the Vermont Republic.

Their hosts are salt- and fresh-water fish, causing a type of fish velvet disease (also called gold dust disease). One species has also been recorded on various cnidarians. The host typically develops a yellow or gold \\"dust\\" scattered on its head, fins and body. At this stage, the infestation is already severe. The attack usually starts at the gills, at which stage it is difficult to observe. The host fish is irritated, and often sporadically darts about or rubs itself against rocks. The yellowish spots are more vivid under a strong light source. It is very similar to Ichthyophthirius, though the oodinium spots are yellowish and smaller. The life cycle of oodinium starts as a dinospore that swims in the water to look for a suitable host. As it attaches itself onto the host skin, it forms a hard shell protecting itself against the outside environment while it is eating the fish skin cells. This is the cyst stage seen as dust covering the fish skin. After few days, the cyst sinks to the bottom, freeing a new generation of dinospores. As the cycle repeats, the dinospore must find a host within 48 hours or else die. Treatment is possible by diluting the commercially available copper salts. Free swimming dinospores are extremely vulnerable to copper compounds. Bringing the water temperature to 30¬∞C helps to release the dinospore from the cyst.

She was later converted to an ammunition ship and redesignated (AE-31). Chara (AKA-58) was launched on 15 March 1944 by Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Co., Kearny, New Jersey, under a Maritime Commission contract, sponsored by Mrs. E. P. McHugh, acquired by the Navy on 16 March 1944, and commissioned on 14 June 1944, Commander C. B. Hamblett, USNR, in command. Service history=1944-1949 Chara cleared Norfolk 22 July 1944 for Pearl Harbor, arriving on 10 August for training. Her initial combat action came on 20 October when she hove to in Leyte Gulf, with the Southern Attack Force, and swiftly landed troops and cargo in the momentous assault that was the first step in the liberation of the Philippines. Chara withdrew on 24 October, while the decisive naval Battle of Leyte Gulf raged in the area. She returned to New Guinea to reload essential supplies which she delivered to support the continuing land Battle of Leyte on 18 November. After rehearsal landings in New Guinea, and staging at Manus, Chara cleared on 31 December 1944 for the assault on Lingayen. As TF 97 penetrated Philippine waters, on 8 January 1945, a Japanese kamikaze attack was hurled at them and succeeded in damaging one escort carrier of the group. On board Chara, three men were wounded, one fatally, as a result of the heavy anti-aircraft fire thrown up by the task force. The assaults were made on 9 January and 10 January, Chara's men landing their troops and cargo successfully despite heavy surf conditions and a beach so difficult that the Japanese never anticipated an amphibious assault in the location. Chara remained in the Leyte area, participating in the landings on San Antonio on 26 January, until 26 March, when she steamed from San Pedro Bay combat-loaded for the beaches of Okinawa. Once again at Okinawa, her men worked skillfully in an amphibious assault, as Chara landed troops and heavy equipment on 1 April 1945. She remained off Okinawa in this invasion, famous for the Japanese desperation kamikaze attacks, to unload reinforcements and additional equipment until 6 April. After overhaul in the States and a return to Okinawa with cargo on 5 July, Chara returned to San Francisco where she loaded supplies for the Philippines, calling en route for additional supplies at Pearl Harbor, thus beginning a period of cargo operations in the Philippines and to Japan in support of the occupation. She returned to the States in December 1945, then continued to support forces in the Far East until 1950, carrying men and cargo for the Naval Transportation Service, and after 1 October 1949, for the Military Sea Transportation Service. 1950-1959 Chara replenishing carrier and destroyer , ca. 1950 With the outbreak of the Korean War, Chara was transferred to Service Force, Pacific Fleet, for duty as an ammunition ship, transporting and transferring all types of ammunition at sea to fleet units. She cleared San Francisco on 16 September 1950 to replenish TF 77 and support the evacuations of Hungnam and Wonsan before returning to San Francisco for overhaul on 26 March 1951. In her second Korean tour, 19 July 1951 to 18 May 1952, she joined the Mobile Logistics Support Force in operations in the Wonsan-Songjin bomb-line triangle, and in emergency lifts of Korean POWs from Koje-do to Ulsan. Another tour of providing at-sea replenishment of ammunition preceded the end of hostilities. Chara later alternated duty in the western Pacific with training and upkeep on the west coast. In December 1954 and January 1955, she took part in the evacuation of the Tachen Islands. Active through 1958, Chara was placed out of commission in reserve at Astoria, Oregon, on 21 April 1959. 1966-1972 She was converted to an ammunition ship at Willamette Iron and Steel Works in Portland, Oregon, and recommissioned as AE-31 on 25 June 1966. After sea trials in July, 1966 she supported Operation Rolling Thunder in Westpac and Vietnam. This included underway replenishment of aircraft carriers (such as USS Ranger) both off Vietnam and off the United States Coast. During an underway replenishment, her decks would be loaded with palettes of bombs six feet high, and in her cargo hold were 3,000 pound bombs used for airstrikes. During this time her US operational bases were in Vallejo, San Francisco Bay and Indian Island, Puget Sound.Chara was finally decommissioned in March 1972, and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 10 March 1972. She was sold for scrap on 12 November 1972. Awards Chara received four battle stars for service during World War II, seven for service during the Korean War, and eight for service in Vietnam.

Fort Foster was originally built in December 1836 under the direction of Lieutenant Colonel William S. Foster on the site of Fort Alabama. On December 1, 1836 Colonel Foster arrived at the site with 430 men to rebuild the fort and bridge that had been destroyed months earlier. By December 19, he had erected two blockhouses, a large storehouse and a fort. Then on December 22, Col. Foster departed with 180 men, and 25 wagons with provisions and forage to resupply Fort Armstrong. The remainder of his men were tasked with completing the bridge and powder magazine. On January 1, 1837, Col. Foster boasted in a letter to General R. Jones that, \\"the works at \\"Fort Foster\\" on the Hillsborough River. That Fort & Bridge form one of the best and strongest field fortifications ever erected against Indians.\\" Fort Foster was a strategic fortification built for the protection of the bridge and with more importance on the supplies within. Fortified supply depots were continuously placed deeper into Seminole territory to allow the soldiers to operate in the field while they captured the hostile Seminoles. The armament and supplies at Fort Foster consisted as follows: A six-pounder gun and a twelve pounder howitzer with at least 100 rounds of ammunition for each. Forty thousand rounds of rifle powder and bullets. Fifty thousand ball and buckshot cartridges. Fifty thousand rations of subsistence and ten thousand bushels of corn. Tools of every description as well as iron, steel, nails, cordage, & etc. required for service in the field. Fort Foster was garrisoned from January until March 1837 by Navy Lieutenant Thomas J. Leib, two midshipmen and about 50 sailors from . Lt. Leib was also provided with 20 artillerymen to man the six-pound iron gun and twelve-pound howitzer to defend the fortification and bridge. The site was significant for skirmishes in February 1837 during the Second Seminole War, when 50 seamen from USS Concord and 20 artillerymen resisted Seminole attacks and attempts by the hostile Seminoles to burn the bridge. That summer, the fort was abandoned because of disease among its forces. Fort Foster was reactivated in the fall of 1837 to the summer 1838 to act as a supply post. Then it remained abandoned until 1841-1842, and again in 1849 when it only opened for short periods to meet the needs of the military when Seminole activity threatened.The Florida Bicentennial Trail The fort site was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on June 13, 1972. The fort was reconstructed on the site by the state and opened to the public in February 1980. It is owned and operated by the Florida State Park system as Fort Foster State Historic Site, a part of Hillsborough River State Park.

Small was originally waiting on Adult Swim for an appropriate budget in order to end the show the way he wants rather than rushing it. But after pitching the idea for the finale to the network, they turned it down, stating that they did not have the budget for it. In October 2015, Brendon Small announced a month-long social media campaign entitled \\"Metalocalypse Now\\" as an attempt to gather fan support to have Hulu and Adult Swim co- finance the final season of Metalocalypse.

Buford is the author of the books Among the Thugs and Heat: An Amateur's Adventures as Kitchen Slave, Line Cook, Pasta-Maker, and Apprentice to a Dante-Quoting Butcher in Tuscany. He was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and raised in Southern California, attending the University of California, Berkeley, before moving to King's College, University of Cambridge, where he studied as a Marshall Scholar. He remained in England for most of the 1980s. Buford was previously the fiction editor for The New Yorker, where he is still on staff. For sixteen years, he was the editor of Granta, which he relaunched in 1979. Buford is credited with coining the term \\"dirty realism\\". Work=As an author Among the Thugs (1991) is presented as an insider's account of the world of (primarily) English football hooliganism. His chief thesis is that the traditional sociological account of crowd theory fails to understand the often complex problem of football violence as a particularly English working- class phenomenon. His book, based on years of exhaustive first-hand research as an 'outsider'‚Äîin terms of both his background and his position as a member of the journalistic community‚Äîis considered by some to be one of the great social-research documents. Heat (2006) is Buford's account of working for free in the kitchen of Babbo, a New York City restaurant owned by chef Mario Batali. Buford's premise is that he considered himself a capable home cook and wondered whether he had the skills to work in a busy restaurant kitchen. He met Batali at a dinner party and asked whether he would take on Buford as his \\"kitchen bitch\\".Metacritic.com review Will work for food Buford began his time at Babbo in a variety of roles including dishwasher, prep cook, garbage remover and any other role demanded of him. Over the course of the book, his skills improve and he is able to butcher a hog and work many stations in the restaurant; he traveled to Italy to meet cooks and chefs who were crucial to Batali's early culinary development, as Buford worked and lived in some of the places Batali honed his craft. Subsequently, Buford started working on a book on French cuisine. In October 2007, his article titled \\"Extreme Chocolate: The Quest for the Perfect Bean\\" was published in The New Yorker. It described his world travels with a leader in the world of gourmet dark chocolate, Fred Schilling of Dagoba Chocolates. Buford's article \\"Cooking with Daniel: Three French Classics\\", about his experience cooking with French chef Daniel Boulud, was published in the July 29, 2013, issue of The New Yorker. In an interview posted on The New Yorkers website to accompany the article, he discussed his time living in France and what he had learned about French cooking. Salman Rushdie's The Enchantress of Florence (2008) is dedicated \\"to Bill Buford\\". As an editor Buford relaunched the then-defunct literary magazine Granta in 1979. Under his leadership that journal became highly influential and \\"rose to conquer the literary world.\\" He edited it until 1995, when he left to become the fiction editor of The New Yorker. In 2002, The New Yorker announced that he would leave the latter position at the beginning of 2003, to be replaced by Deborah Treisman, his deputy whom he had recruited to the magazine.

He was also involved in the sequel publications to the Encyclop√©die, took on Diderot's editorial role, and was a translator of numerous works to the French language. Life Robinet was born in Rennes on 23 June 1735, and died there on 24 March 1820. Early in life he was educated by the Jesuits and embraced the rule of St. Ignatius, but soon regretted his loss of freedom and entered the world of letters. He traveled to Holland to publish his book De la nature which in time gained notoriety due to the peculiar opinions presented in the book. Upon his return to Paris in 1778 he was appointed royal censor and private secretary to Antoine-Jean Amelot de Chaillou. During the French revolution he lost all employment and retired to his home, where he lived in relative seclusion, occupied only with family duties. He had been a disciple of encyclop√©distes, but was also committed to the principles of the church. He eventually returned to the church and signed a recantation of his errors.Fran√ßois-Xavier Feller, Biographie Universelle ou Dictionnaire Historique... Vol.7 J. Leroux (1849) p. 274 Work Robinet is one of the many precursors in the history of evolutionary thought who contributed to the process which later crystallized in the work of Charles Darwin. Jean-Baptiste was led from observations into the idea of the transmutation of species and so into a theory of evolution, which in some important respects anticipated modern ideas. In De la nature, published in 1761, Nature was not God, but necessarily and eternally evolved from Divine essence. Creation is the everlasting work of the Deity, who from eternity has been working and smoothly progressing in the manner of Nature. There are no leaps. All things must have come from unity, which has been infinitely diversified. Kingdoms, classes and species are artificial works of man, of which Nature knows nothing. The orangutan was next to man in the scale of being. All the links of Nature's chain may not yet have been discovered, but they would be discovered before long.Bonamy Price, The Contemporary Review, Vol.14 \\"Nature Development and Theology\\" Strahan & Co., Publishers (1870) Robinet represented a teleological point of view in his discussions on evolution. All was produced from a divine, pre-existing, and static master- plan. He wrote that in diverse lower animals, Nature advances, groping towards the excellence of the human being. Some imperceptible progress is made at each step, each new production a variation of the primitive design, becoming very responsive after a number of metamorphoses. The development of the human machine had taken a long succession of arrangements, compositions and dissolutions, additions and deletions, alterations, cancellations, and changes of all kinds.Jean-Baptiste-Ren√© Robinet, Consid√©rations philosophiques de la gradation des formes de l‚Äô√™tre, ou les essais de la nature qui apprend √† faire l‚Äôhomme, 1768, pp. 3‚Äì5.

During its ground-breaking undercover 'stings', Cook confronted targets, and he and the film crew sometimes suffered verbal and physical abuse. The Cook Report was by some margin the highest rated current affairs programme on British television, with audiences peaking at more than 12 million.

In total some 1,243 people in the UK were infected with HIV through using these products. At the time of the show some 100 had died of AIDS, as of 2017 the total number of those who have died who were infected with HIV is closer to 1,000. Since the show aired the scandal has roared on and continues to be debated in British Parliament as victims and their families still fight for justice.http://www.haemophilia.org.uk/news/view?id=87&x;%5B0%5D=news/list \\"Cash for questions\\" investigation In 1994, The Cook Report worked in co-operation with The Guardian newspaper on the cash for questions story and had filmed a lobbyist claiming that he ‚Äòused MPs like taxis‚Äô and paid them to ask questions in Parliament on behalf of clients. The programme arranged a sting operation to see if this claim was justified, but by the end of the then current series filming was incomplete. The Guardian subsequently decided to cover the story. Since the story would have been dated by the time the programme was back on air nearly six months later, it was cancelled. It was the only film out of the 130 produced which was cancelled in this way. Cook Report Specials The Cook Report ran regularly for two seven-part series each year until 1997, when the programme reached its 122nd edition. It was then replaced by a number of hour-long Cook Report Specials including: *Doctors From Hell (24/08/1999) *Locks, Stocks, Burglars and Fences (23/04/1999) *The Dodgy Motor Show (03/12/1998) *The Antiques Rogue Show (19/08/1998) *Profits Before Patients (23/07/1990) *The Devil's Work (17/07/1989) Cancelled  The Cook Report came to an end in 1999 when ITV, which had previously cancelled a number of current affairs programmes made for the channel (including World in Action) was faced with dwindling budgets and had concentrated on other kinds of programming. The ITV Network Centre decided to concentrate its current affairs efforts on Tonight - which, though it attracted fewer viewers, was said to be significantly less costly to make. Cook went on to work on other projects and is also Emeritus Visiting Professor at the Centre for Broadcasting and Journalism at Nottingham Trent University. He was made an Honorary Doctor of Letters in 2004. The programme did return for a one-off, 90-minute special, Roger Cook's Greatest Hits, on 30 October 2007. This update episode was produced by ITV Productions and Interesting Films. Newspaper allegations In February and April 2000, the News of the World published a series of front page allegations claiming that The Cook Report had faked a number of programmes in which crimes were set up for him to solve.Carlton investigates Cook Report 'set ups Janine Gibson, Media CorrespondentThe Guardian, Monday 14 February 2000 Roger Cook and members of the relevant production teams issued writs for libel, against the paper. The newspaper demanded an investigation by the then regulator, the Independent Television Commission, after it sent its dossier of evidence about the programme which, after an eighteen-month investigation, in October 2001 exonerated the programme. The News of the World initially dismissed the Commission‚Äôs findings as ‚Äòa whitewash‚Äô, but after key witnesses for the defense had voluntarily retracted their paid-for testimony, the News of the World reluctantly had to agree with the ITC‚Äôs conclusions and made the following statement to that effect in open court: \\"The News of the World accepts that neither Mr Cook nor Carlton [TV] nor the editors, producers, legal advisers and researchers were a party to any fakery or deception.\\" It was also accepted that the allegations were false and should never have been published, but the subsequent short correction was printed on page 38.

Early life and education Ernst Witebsky was born in Frankfurt am Main. From 1920 to 1926 Witebsky studied medicine at the University of Frankfurt and the University of Heidelberg. Career After graduating from medical school in 1925 he worked with Hans Sachs at Heidelberg primarily on brain and organ tissue, as well as blood group antigens. In 1933, he left Germany for Switzerland as a result of Nazi pressure, and in 1935 joined the Medical School of the University at Buffalo. In the 1950s he had begun studying antigens specific to a single organ, in the case of the thyroid gland, the antigen was thyroglobulin. He was a mentor to Noel Rose in this research endeavor to prepare thyroglobulin from rabbits. In 1967 the State University of New York created The Center for Immunology in Buffalo and appointed him as its first director. Achievements Witebsky helped develop procedures for the isolation and partial characterization of A and B blood antigens. He also began the practice of neutralization of certain antibodies in the blood of universal blood donors. In 1957 he co-authored a paper the \\"Witebsky's postulates\\" which determined whether a disease entity could be regarded as an autoimmune disease: * Direct demonstration of free circulating antibodies active at body temperature. * Recognition of the specific antigen (for this antibody). * Production of antibodies against same antigen in experimental animals. * Experimental animal demonstrates same tissue changes in human. In 1993, the Postulates were revised based on direct evidence from transfer of pathogenic antibody or pathogenic T-cells, indirect evidence based on reproduction of the autoimmune disease in experimental animals and circumstantial evidence from clinical clues.: * Auto-antibodies detectable in all cases of disease. * Experimentally reproducible by immunization with antigen. * Experimental disease must show immunopathological lesions that parallel those in the natural disease. * Transferable by serum or lymphoid cells. In 1959 Witebsky received the Karl Landsteiner Award for his work with blood antibodies. In 2019, Witebsky was posthumously honored alongside his mentee, Noel Rose, with a Golden Goose Award for their work on autoimmune disease.

In the late 1990s he won several medals in the international short course and long course events. He's a recipient of the Spanish Cross of the Order of Merit (Silver and Bronze designation), handed to him by then crown prince Felipe de Borb√≥n (Felipe VI). During his swimming career he made finals in the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, winning the \\"B\\" Final in the 400m IM. At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, with aspirations and goals to medal in the 400m IM, he fell victim to influenza and was not able to qualify for the finals in his prime event, the 400m individual medley (IM). He swam in three Swimming World Championships. Rome, Italy in 1994, Perth, Australia in 1998 and Hong Kong, China in 1999, with his best performance coming at the 1999 SC World Championships in Hong Kong, China. He won a bronze medal and broke the Spanish national record in the 400m IM at the event. He participated in seven European Aquatics Championships: at Sheffield, England, in 1993; Vienna in 1995; Seville, Spain in 1997; Sheffield again in 1998; Istanbul in 1999; Lisbon in 1999; and Valencia, Spain, in 2000.

The squadron is famous for Operation Jericho on 18 February 1944, when the crews of Mosquitoes breached the walls of a Gestapo prison at Amiens, France, allowing members of the French Resistance to escape. History=World War One No. 21 Squadron Royal Flying Corps was formed at Netheravon on 23 July 1915, equipped with the Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.7. After six months of training, the squadron was sent to the France in January 1916.Halley 1980, p. 48. The main role for its R.E.7s was reconnaissance, while it also operated small numbers of Bristol Scout DsBruce 1982, p. 167. and a single Martinsyde G.100 as escort fighters.Bruce 1982, p. 278. Although the R.E.7 was badly underpowered, 21 Squadron used its R.E.7s as bombers during the Battle of the Somme,Bruce 1982, p. 453‚Äì455. being the first Squadron to drop 336 lb (153 kg bombs.\\"21 Squadron\\" . Royal Air Force. Retrieved 26 February 2012. It discarded its R.E.7s in August 1916, replacing them by single seat Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.12s.Lewis 1959, p. 22. These were used as bombers, and despite being almost useless at the role, as fighters. In February 1917, the Squadron re-equipped again, receiving the R.E.8, and gave a good account of itself in the Corps Reconnaissance role. On one day, 7 June 1917, at the beginning of the Battle of Messines, its artillery spotting was responsible for putting 72 German batteries out of action.Bruce Flight 15 August 1954, p. 578. This led General Trenchard, the commander of the Royal Flying Corps in France, to describe No. 21 as \\"the best artillery squadron in France\\". In April 1918, 21 Squadron were based at Saint Inglevert. After the end of the war the squadron handed over its aircraft to 13 Squadron and was disbanded on 1 October 1919. Light bomber squadron The squadron was reformed on 3 December 1935 at RAF Bircham Newton as a light bomber squadron equipped with the Hawker Hind biplane. It moved to RAF Abbotsinch, Glasgow on 22 July 1936Halley 1980, p. 49. and transferred to No. 2 Group on 1 August that year, but transferred again, this time to No. 1 Group on 6 October.Bowyer 1974, pp. 34, 479. The squadron moved to RAF Lympne in Kent in November 1936. By August 1938 it began to receive the more modern Bristol Blenheim monoplane, and moved to RAF Eastchurch, also in Kent.Halley 1980, pp. 48‚Äì49. The Munich crisis saw the squadron mobilise in preparation for a possible war with Germany. The squadron temporarily joined 2 Group on 27 September and moved to RAF Cottesmore, before the end of the crisis on 8 October saw the squadron return to 1 Group and Eastchurch.Bowyer 1974, pp. 46‚Äì47. On 1 January 1939, the squadron rejoined 2 Group, and moved to RAF Watton in Norfolk on 2 March 1939.Bowyer 1974, p. 479. On the outbreak of the Second World War, the squadron was converting to the Blenheim IV and so was not fully operational,Bowyer 1974, pp. 54‚Äì55. thus operations were initially limited to reconnaissance missions. In May 1940, as a result of the German attack on the Low Countries and France it began daylight attacks on advancing German columns in the Low Countries and France, flying its first mission of the campaign on 11 May, when 11 Blenheims unsuccessfully attacked a bridge at Maastricht, with two Blenheims shot down and eight damaged.Bowyer 1974, p. 85. From June to October 1940 the squadron operated from RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland to attack German shipping off the coast of Norway and to deter any German invasion across the North Sea.Bowyer 1974, p. 115. Back in Norfolk the squadron began regular low-level attacks on enemy shipping. At the end of 1941 the squadron moved to Malta to attack Italian shipping. The squadron was disbanded in Malta on 14 March 1942. Ventura attacking IJmuiden, in February 1943. On the same day a new 21 Squadron was formed at RAF Bodney, still with the Blenheim, but re-equipped a few months later with the Lockheed Ventura.Bowyer 1974, p. 254.Dunnell Aeroplane April 2018 p. 52. It was the first RAF squadron to use the Ventura, moving to RAF Methwold on 1 November. It flew its first operational mission using the Ventura, a low-level attack by three aircraft on railway lines near Hengelo in the Netherlands, on 3 November.Bowyer 1974, p. 261. On 6 December it took part in Operation Oyster, a large-scale attack by 2 Group on the Philips works at Eindhoven, with three of its aircraft being lost.Bowyer 1974, pp. 270‚Äì283. The aircraft was never really suitable for the squadron's activities and they were replaced by October 1943 with the de Havilland Mosquito.Dunnell Aeroplane April 2018 p. 53. The squadron turned to night raids on continental Europe; it also carried out precision daylight raids including a notable attack on Gestapo headquarters in Denmark, and involvement in Operation Jericho. During the invasion the Squadron was flying night intruder attacks against German targets. The Squadron moved to RAF Gutersloh in December 1945. It provided courier services between Blackbushe and Nuremberg in support of the Nuremberg Trials before it was disbanded on 7 November 1947. On 21 September 1953 the Squadron was reformed at RAF Scampton as a bomber unit with the English Electric Canberra. It was involved in many overseas detachments and was part of the forces involved in the Suez operation of 1956. It was disbanded on 30 June 1957 at RAF Waddington. On 1 October 1958, 542 Squadron was re-numbered as 21 Squadron with the Canberra B6, and was detached to Australia in support of trials of nuclear weapons. When the tests were completed the squadron disbanded on 15 January 1959. Transport squadron Formation again on 1 May 1959 at RAF Benson saw a completely different role for the squadron: it was equipped with the Scottish Aviation Twin Pioneer as a light transport squadron. It moved to Kenya in September that year, being based at RAF Eastleigh, Nairobi. It operated in support of the British Army, the King's African Rifles and the Kenyan Police. The squadron moved to Aden in June 1965, taking over the Twin Pioneers of No.78 Squadron and supplementing them with Douglas Dakotas and Hawker Siddeley Andovers. With the withdrawal of British forces from Aden the squadron was disbanded on 9 September 1967.Halley 1980, pp. 48‚Äì49, 116.Rawlings 1982, pp. 39‚Äì40. The squadron's last formation was on 3 February 1969, when the Western Communications Squadron was re-designated at RAF Andover. It provided transport for senior officers in the western part of the United Kingdom using the Devon and Pembroke. It was disbanded following defence cuts on 31 March 1976.Rawlings 1982, pp. 39‚Äì40, 262.

They both attended George Washington High School in New York City's Washington Heights neighborhood. Smith did not realize that the sculpture, for which he posed, became the fabled Heisman Trophy until 1982. A documentary filmmaker tracked down Smith through his brother-in-law, Bob Pastor, a former heavyweight boxer who fought Joe Louis twice. The Downtown Athletic Club subsequently presented Smith with a Heisman Trophy of his own in 1985. Smith was what sportswriters used to refer to as a triple- threat: he ran, passed and often quick-kicked in New York University's single- wing offense during the 1933‚Äì1935 seasons. Smith suffered a torn ligament in his left leg and a hemorrhage in his right leg and NYU went 3‚Äì4‚Äì1 in 1934. The 1935 Thanksgiving game was the last of Smith's collegiate career. The first Heisman Trophy presentation was on December 5, 1935. The Boston Redskins drafted Smith in the NFL's first ever draft in February 1936. He was selected in round three, the #20 pick overall. Smith graduated from NYU in the spring of 1936 and proceeded to a career in professional football. The pay was $200 a game for the twelve-week season. Smith played with the Redskins in the 1936 season. The Redskins played in the 1936 NFL Championship Game at New York's Polo Grounds on December 13, 1936. The Skins lost to the Green Bay Packers 21-6. Smith played with the Green Bay Packers under coach Curly Lambeau in the 1937 season. His ligament injury returned while playing in Green Bay and Smith left professional sports. He later played and coached semi-pro football in Springfield, Massachusetts in 1941. As player-coach, Smith again connected with Vince Lombardi, who played under Smith. Smith and his wife Hilda lived most of their life in Washington Heights. Smith worked for Otis Elevator in the post-war era.

The revisions include extensive usage of politically correct buzzwords (and parodies thereof), deliberately stiff moralizing dialogue and narration, inclusion of modern concepts and objects (such as health spas, mineral water, and automobiles), and often feature a plot twist that reverses the roles of the heroes and villains of the story (for example, the woodsman in Little Red Riding Hood is seen by Red Riding Hood not as a heroic saviour but as a \\"sexist\\" and \\"speciesist\\" interloper, and Snow White's evil stepmother ends up with a positive portrayal while the prince and the seven dwarves are portrayed as chauvinistic). Politically Correct Bedtime Stories was Garner's first published book (or, in the words of his similarly satirical biography blurb from the book, \\"his first processed tree carcass\\"). More than 2.5 million copies have been sold in the United States and it has since been translated into 20 languages. Garner wrote two follow-up books: Once upon a More Enlightened Time: More Politically Correct Bedtime Stories and Politically Correct Holiday Stories: For an Enlightened Yuletide Season, the latter book satirizing political correctness during the Christmas holiday season. In 1998, the three books were compiled into an omnibus collection called Politically Correct: The Ultimate Storybook. All editions of the Politically Correct titles are currently out of print. In 2018, Garner released \\"Politically Correct Pinocchio\\". Stories The following is a listing of the stories in the order they appear in the book. Little Red Riding Hood Based on the popular fairy tale of the same name, this parody includes as its main themes mocking the idea of anti-\\"speciesism\\" and the more radical branches and concepts of feminism (such as using the spelling \\"womyn\\" instead of \\"women\\" throughout, a pattern that is repeated in other stories in the book), and is one of the several stories in which the ending is completely altered from the original fairy tale. The woodsman (who saves Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother in the most well-known versions of the tale) ends up beheaded by the grandmother, who leaps from the wolf's mouth of her own accord after a \\"stirring\\" moralizing speech from Red, who states that womyn and wolves can solve their own problems without a man's interference. This comes after, of course, Red Riding Hood has labeled him as \\"sexist\\" and \\"speciesist\\" for deciding to try to save Red Riding Hood by killing the wolf. The wolf, Red Riding Hood, and her grandmother then form an \\"alternative household\\" together. The Emperor's New Clothes This is a parody of the eponymous fairy tale. The well-known ending is not entirely changed, but the outcome of it and moral of the story nonetheless do. The story ends with a pro-nudist twist, with the whole kingdom quickly deciding to adopt a clothing optional society. The Three Little Pigs A parody of the fairy tale of the same name, in it the wolves are greedy capitalists and the pigs are natives forced off their land who later become freedom fighters or \\"porcinistas\\", parodying the Nicaraguan party Sandinista National Liberation Front, or Sandinism. The Big Bad Wolf succumbs to a heart attack. The \\"porcinistas\\" slaughter the wolves, take back their lands and found a utopian socialist democracy in its place, living happily ever after. Rumpelstiltskin A parody of the classic Rumpelstiltskin story. Instead of turning the straw into gold by magic, the girl (Esmeralda) and Rumpelstiltskin take the straw to poor farmers, who use it to thatch their roofs; in better health, the farmers become more productive, which improves the local economy and eventually leads to the overthrow of the prince and Esmeralda's being rewarded with gold. Esmeralda is then able to thwart Rumpelstiltskin's plan to take her first-born child by guessing his name; however, unlike in the original tale, she only guesses it because his \\"Little People's Empowerment Seminar\\" nametag is still on his body. Angry at the idea that her reproductive rights were almost taken away from her, she moves to California and starts a birth control clinic and lives happily ever after‚Äîas a \\"fulfilled, dedicated single person.\\" The Three Codependent Goats Gruff This is a parody of the Billy Goats Gruff folktale, which satirizes \\"the masochistic tendencies of modern American liberal morality\\". The three Billy Goats and the Troll all attempt to take the blame for the situation and end up in a mass brawl which results in them falling off the bridge. Rapunzel A parody of the Rapunzel fairy tale, with a completely different ending. It features the twist of the prince having connections in the music recording industry; having heard her sing, he wants to make her a star‚Äîand profit heavily from merchandizing both her voice and her appearance. He soon convinces the witch that she should agree to the deal and stay on as her manager. However, Rapunzel, disgusted by the idea of her voice being exploited for capitalist gain, climbs out of the tower and runs off to become a folk musician who performs for free in a \\"coffee house\\". Cinderella A parody of the Cinderella fairy tale, with a distinctly feminist and anti-lookist twist. The ending is completely different from the original fairy tale. Cinderella's \\"Fairy Godperson\\" (who is male) reluctantly agrees to dress her up for the ball. However, she is so attractive in her impractical shoes, clothing and makeup, that every male in the ballroom goes mad for her and a brawl begins that eventually results in the death of every last one of them. The women, envious of Cinderella's ability to make men go mad because of her beauty, at first turn on her; however, the clock strikes 12:00 midnight and she is transformed back to her peasant garb‚Äîand is so happy to be in comfortable clothes again that the other women decide that they are now envious of her comfort. Instead of killing her, however, they remove their own corsets, dresses and impractical shoes and dance around in their \\"shifts and bare feet\\". Covering up the real reason behind the men's deaths, they take over the kingdom and open a clothing company that produces only comfortable and practical clothing for women. Goldilocks A parody of the original Goldilocks and the Three Bears fairy tale, Goldilocks is not a little girl, but rather a greedy rogue biologist bent on tracking and studying the peaceful anthropomorphic bears to make a splash in the scientific community. Goldilocks attempts to put tranquilizers in the bears' porridge and traps with radio collars in their beds. However, the bears note the \\"chemical\\" smell of their organic porridge and, suspicious, discover the traps as well as Goldilocks, who has fallen asleep in the corner of the room while waiting for her targets to return. The Papa Bear and Mama Bear then brutally kill and consume Goldilocks while the shocked Baby Bear looks on; it is revealed that the family is vegetarian, though the parents made an exception this time. Snow White This parody is based on the classic Snow White fairy tale, with numerous satirical twists (for example, the Seven Dwarfs, who are referred to as \\"vertically challenged men\\", run a retreat for men wanting to indulge in \\"primal\\" behavior) and a completely different ending. It has similar themes to the Cinderella parody from earlier in the book. As in the original story, the queen pretends to be an old woman selling apples which, in truth, are poisoned. However, during the course of conversation with Snow White, she bonds with her. Forgetting that the apple in question was poisoned, she shares it with Snow White and both fall comatose to the floor. Meanwhile, the dwarfs return‚Äîwith the prince. The prince is at the retreat to try and cure his impotence, and, attracted to the nubile coma victim, requests to have sex with her; at which point the dwarfs decide that the unconscious Snow White makes a perfect impotence treatment and decide to display her so that they can make more money. However, when they try to move the two women's bodies, the poisoned apple pieces become dislodged from their throats - as in the original story; the women awaken, angry and disgusted at what they overheard while comatose and unable to act. The queen then declares that the dwarfs are trespassers, and throws them out of her forest. She and Snow White later open a spa for women on the same spot. Chicken Little A parody of the popular folktale of the same name, this story largely satirizes frivolous lawsuits. Chicken Little, Henny Penny and Goosey Loosey attempt to sue for various matters, and end up getting involved in a court battle lasting till this day. The Frog Prince A parody of the Frog Prince fairy tale. The Frog Prince in here is rather a land developer who cheated several landlords out of their property and was consequently punished by being turned into a frog. Once turned back into a human, the developer attempts to get the princess to help him in his greedy schemes to develop more land, which ends in her killing him. Jack and the Beanstalk A parody of the fairy tale of the same name. Jack attempts to steal the magic harp and eggs, but is trapped by the giant who reveals that he has uprooted the beanstalk, and invites Jack to join the cloud community, made up of people who have become trapped in a similar fashion. The Pied Piper of Hamelin A parody of the Pied Piper fairy tale, this story satirizes anti-capitalism. Other satirical content in the book The writer and publishers ‚Äì not content to merely let the stories themselves be the only satire in the book ‚Äì also featured satirical content in the book jacket author's biography blurb, the description of the book itself (\\"[...] the stories were sexist, discriminatory, unfair, culturally biased, and in general, demeaning to witches, animals, goblins, and fairies everywhere. [...] We'd like to think that future generations of fairy tale fans will see this as a worthy attempt to develop meaningful literature that is totally free of bias and purged from the influences of the flawed cultural past.\\"), as well, of course, as in the introduction which goes so far as to include the following breathless passage: Writing style, common themes and recurring elements The book features many recurring themes and elements throughout the story. One recurring element is the alternate spellings of \\"wommon\\" and \\"womyn\\" (instead of \\"woman\\" and \\"women\\"). Additionally, the inclusion of distinctly modern concepts (such as Goldilocks being a rogue biologist, or Red Riding Hood bringing her grandmother mineral water) is common throughout the book, in keeping with the concept of \\"updating\\" classic fairy tales for modern times. Another common element is that many of the previous heroes or villains have had a role reversal, with female villains usually becoming more enlightened or empowered and befriending the heroine. Female characters (with few exceptions) rescue themselves after being similarly empowered and enlightened. The protagonist of each story purportedly conform to the above-mentioned ideologies to absurd, obsessive levels. The satirical style used throughout the book, from the introduction to every one of the stories and then some, is that of an overly cautious, excessively verbose author who so fears offending or maligning any one reader that he is continually sidetracked and preoccupied by using politically correct (or pseudo-politically correct) terminology and phrasing, to the point of ridiculousness and redundancy. However, the book is absent of polemics‚Äîits stories are styled only upon a deadpan context of removing of all traditional bias, stereotype and prejudice from well-known fiction, under the pretense of not warping young minds.

In some, ribs seem to zigzag between umbilical tubercles and parallel ventrolateral clavi. In others the ribs are flexuous and curve forward from the umbilical shoulder and lap onto either side of the venter. Fossils of this animal are commonly found in Lower Cretaceous, middle to upper Albian age strata.AM√âDRO, Francis (2013). \\"Euhoplites Barroisi sp. nov.: Une Nouvelle Ammonite de L'Albien Sup√©rieur de Wissant (Pas-de-Calais, France).\\" Soci√©t√© G√©ologique du Nord. Its shell was covered with lumps and bumps. The function of these adornments are unknown, although they may have been a source of hydrodynamic drag, preventing Euhoplites from swimming at high speeds. Studying them, therefore, may give some insight into the lifestyle of this ancient marine predator. Euhoplites was a small ammonite with shells of diameters of at most a few inches in diameter, depending on the age, species and possibly gender of the individual. Distribution Euhoplites has been found in Middle and Upper Albian beds in France where it is associated respectively with Hoplites and Anahoplites, and with Pleurohoplites, Puzosia, and Desmoceras; in the Middle Albian of Brazil with Anahoplites and Turrilites; and in the Cenomanian of Texas. It is the most common ammonite fossil of the Folkstone (sometimes spelt \\"Folkestone\\") fossil beds in southeastern England where a variety of species are found. Classification= Taxonomic relations  Euhoplites is closely related to Hoplites and to other hoplitid genera such as Epihopites and Protohoplites included in the subfamily, Hopliitinae. Other subfamilies in the Hoplitidae, with more distantly related genera are the Cleoniceratinae and Gastrohoplitinae.  Species  In the past, big number of species have been attributed to this genus. In later research it has been found that species of Euhoplites have big intraspecific variability and most of the species are just synonyms. This is even the case of the type species E. truncatus, which is synonym of E. lautus. = E. loricatus = Synonyms: *E. pricei Spath, 1925 *E. aspasia Spath, 1925 *E. microceras Spath, 1925 *E. subtuberculatus Spath, 1927 *E. meandrinus Spath, 1930 *E. neglectus Milbourne, 1963 Lateral ends of lautiform ribs that are strongly bent forward forms blades around concave furrow on the venter. Excavated siphonal line, which is characteristic for most of its descendants is missing in the case of this species. Due to intraspecific variability, many species have been erected that are now considered to be synonyms. These can be ordered from most compressed to thickest as E. aspasia, E. microceras, E. loricatus, E. pricei and E. subtuberculatus. E. loricatus var. meandrina has been formerly promoted to separate species, as its ribs do not start in the groups of 2, or 3, but in groups of 3, or 4. It is the youngest variation of E. loricatus, but now, this separation of it is not considered to be necessary. E. neglectus is considered to be a synonym of E. meandrinus.HANCOCK, J. M., et al. The Gault of the Weald. In: A symposium held. 1963. p. 243-260. = E. lautus = Synonyms: *E. truncatus Spath, 1925 *E. opalinus Spath, 1930 *E. nitidus Spath, 1925 *E. proboscideus J. Sowerby, 1921 Ammonite with strong lautiform ribs that are curved forward in the last third of the flank. It differs from its predecessor, E. loricatus by having excavated siphonal line with subrectangular section. There is big variability in the case of shell thickness. Old synonyms can be ordered by thickness from most compressed to thickest as E. lautus, E. truncatus, E. opalinus, E. nitidus and E. proboscideus. It has lived during middle and early part of upper Albian and gave rise to E. ochetonotus. = E. ochetonotus = Synonyms: *E. sublautus Spath, 1928 *E. solenotus Seeley, 1865 *E. serotinus Spath, 1930 *E. trapezoidalis Spath, 1930 *E. armatus Spath, 1925 Ribs are subradial to flexuous and became attenuated on the living chamber. Venter is flat with siphonal canal and ventro-lateral clavi are slightly oblique to it. Forms of this species, which has been formerly considered to be valid species can be ordered from slimmest to thickest as E. ochetonotus, E. sublautus, E. solenotus, E. serotinus, E. trapezoidalis and E. armatus. It has been living during the base of upper Albian. = E. subcrenatus = Synonyms: *E. inornatus Spath, 1930 Micromorph with very weakened ornamentation. Sigmoid ribs ends at the venter, where they create crenulations by both sides of siphonal canal. Its form, that has been named as formerly separate species E. inornatus is almost smooth. It lived during the early part of upper Albian.AMEDRO, Francis. L'Albien du Bassin Anglo-Parisien: ammonites, zonation phyl√©tique, s√©quences. The Albian in the Anglo-Paris Basin: ammonites, phyletic zonation, sequences. Bulletin des Centres de Recherches Exploration- Production Elf-Aquitaine, 1992, 16: 187-233. = E. alphalautus = Synonyms: *E. vulgaris Spath, 1928 *E. boloniense Spath, 1926 Species with sigmoid ribs that tends to form crenulations on the ventro-lateral shoulder. Siphonal canal is tending to form shape of V and is less hollow than in the case of other species. Species that are now considered to be synonyms were based on the difference in their thickness. E. alphalautus is the thinnest one, while E. boloniense is the thickest one. This species lived during upper Albian. = E. barroisi = These ammonites had moderately evolute whorls, where umbilicus makes 29% of diameter. Whorld section is subhexagonal and biggest thickness is at the level of umbilical tubercules. Umbilical wall is rounded and flanks are slightly convex. Lautiform ribs begins at spiny umbilical tubercules and are tending strongly forward. They are joining at the strongly developed ventro-lateral clavi, which are pinched obliquely to siphonal line and are alternating on both sides. Some other ribs are zigzagging from umblical tubercules to ventro-lateral clavi. On the venter, there is deep concave groove. This is very well visible difference from its predecessor, E. lautus which had siphonal channel. Very similar is E. loricatus, shich also has only ventral groove and is missing siphonal channel. Difference is, that in the case of E. loricatus, ventro-lateral clavi are not oblique to siphonal line, while they are oblique to it in the case of E. barroisi. Important difference is also in stratigraphy, as E. loricatus is middle albian species, while E. barroisi lived during upper Albian zone of Dipoloceras cristatum. There is a gap between their occurrence during the zone of Dimorphoplites biplicatus ammonite zone, during which, the only member of this genus was E. lautus. Evolution Euhoplites has evolved during Lower Albian from Hoplites (Hoplites) canavarii. Among early species belonging to this genus were Euhoplites loricatus, E. aspasia, or E. meandrinus. These early species were added to genus Proeuhoplites, but this genus is by some authors considered to be synonym of Euhoplites. Later species have evolved channelled venter by which they differ from these early species. To these later species belongs for example Euhoplites truncatus, E. lautus, or E. elenae. In the Upper Albian, during Hysteroceras varicosum zone, Euhoplites inornatus has evolved. This differs greatly from contemporaneous members of this genus by not having channelled venter and it looked much more similar to genus Anahoplites. For this species a monotypic genus Euhoplitoides was proposed, but it is also considered to be just a synonym of Euhoplites. Latest members of this genus gave rise to genus Hyphoplites (Discohoplites).Am√©dro, F., Matrion, B., Magniez-Jannin, F., & Touch, R. (2014).

The main character, Cinnamon, is a white puppy with long ears, blue eyes, pink cheeks, and a plump and curly tail that resembles a cinnamon roll. He starred in his own manga series, an anime movie and various animation shorts. In its initial run, the series expanded into two official side series: in 2005, which focuses on Azuki, Mocha and Chiffon and in 2007, which focuses on both Berry and Cherry.

It is native to the high Andes of Bolivia and Peru.  Taxonomy  The first scientific description of this species was made in 1830 by the French scientist Alcide d'Orbigny after he encountered it in the region of Vacas, Cochabamba, in Bolivia at an altitude of . However, as the plants he saw were immature and not yet flowering, he could not classify them taxonomically. The species name of raimondii commemorates the 19th-century Italian scientist Antonio Raimondi, who immigrated to Peru and made extensive botanical expeditions there. He encountered this species in the region of Chav√≠n de Huantar and published it as new to science under the name Pourretia gigantea in his 1874 book El Per√∫ In 1928, the name was changed to Puya raimondii by the German botanist Hermann Harms, as the combination Puya gigantea was already used for a Chilean species.  Description  The queen of the Andes is the largest species of bromeliad. Its trunk can be tall, with a rosette of about two hundred linear leaves, these up to long and about in width, the leaf spines reaching long. The inflorescence can measure between tall.

He has been called \\"the father of commercial aviation in America.\\"Harry Bruno (1944) Wings over America, page 322, Halcyon Press Biography Keys was born in Chatsworth, Ontario, Canada on April 7, 1876 to George Keys, incumbent of St. Paul's Anglican church in the village, and Jessie Margaret Evans, the daughter of an Anglican minister. After completing secondary school in Lindsay, Ontario, he studied classics at University of Toronto, and in 1899 became an instructor in English at Ridley College in Saint Catharines, Ontario, where he began a series of Saturday morning lectures on national and world affairs. In 1901, he became a reporter for The Wall Street Journal covering the railroad beat. Later he was financial editor of the monthly journal World's Work. In 1911 Keys formed an investment counseling firm, C.M. Keys & Company. One of Keys's former students, Casey Baldwin, had remained in contact. Baldwin and university classmate Douglas McCurdy had been involved in Alexander Graham Bell's Aerial Experiment Association, along with Thomas Selfridge and Glenn Curtiss. In 1916, Curtiss approached McCurdy for financial advice in reorganizing his company. McCurdy put Curtiss in touch with Keys, and as a result the latter became an unpaid vice-president for Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company. In 1920, Keys assumed controlling interest of the financially troubled company. The company merged with Wright Aeronautical in 1929 to form Curtiss-Wright with Keys as the new company's president. In 1924, Keys invested $10,000,000 in capital to fund National Air Transport with Paul Henderson, the former Assistant Postmaster General. In June 1929, Keys personally bought all shares of Pitcairn Aviation for 2.5 million dollars, and resold them two weeks later to North American Aviation, which was renamed to Eastern Air Transport and finally Eastern Airlines. Another venture, Transcontinental Air Transport eventually merged with Western Air Express to form Trans World Airlines (TWA). In 1928, Keys set up North American Aviation as a holding company for shares in a variety of aviation businesses. In 1929, he set up two personal holding companies Aviation Exploration Inc. and Intercontinent Aviation, through which he intended to set up joint ventures for creating airlines around the world. Aviation Exploration Inc. was the original holding company for his interests in the China National Aviation Corporation and a share in Compa√±√≠a de Aviaci√≥n Faucett, while through Intercontinent Aviation he organized the creation of Compa√±√≠a Nacional Cubana de Aviaci√≥n Curtiss in September 1929. In 1932, Keys withdrew from the aviation business citing health reasons, but in fact the directors of North American Aviation had discovered that he had embezzled funds in order to settle personal debts incurred from his private speculation in stocks and shares. Nonetheless, he maintained his investment business. In 1942, he went back to the aviation business establishing the C.M.

The squadron's motto is N Wagter in die Lug (Afrikaans) (A guard in the sky), and the badge is a springbok's head couped. History=1915 to 1918 No. 26 Squadron was formed at Netheravon on 8 October 1915 from personnel of the South African Air Corps. It was equipped with B.E.s and Farmans and sent to East Africa in 1915, arriving in Mombasa at the end of January 1916. In February 1918 it was dispatched back to the UK where it was disbanded in July 1918. Between the wars On 11 October 1927, No. 26 was reformed at Catterick as a single flight of Armstrong Whitworth Atlas army co-operation aircraft; on 1 September 1938 a second flight was added. In July 1933 Hawker Audaxes were received, which were replaced by Hawker Hectors in August 1937. Second World War By the outbreak of the Second World War, the Squadron had been equipped with Westland Lysanders and in October 1939 it was moved to France. When the Germans invaded Belgium in May 1940, No. 26 was forced to move to Lympne where it flew reconnaissance, bombing and supply missions over northern France. Coastal patrols began in June and training with the army occupied most of the Squadron's time for the next few years. In February 1941 Curtiss Tomahawks began to arrive to replace the Lysanders for tactical reconnaissance missions. In October 1941 the Tomahawks began to fly low-level ground attack sorties over northern France but they lacked the performance required for operations of this nature, so in January 1942 they were replaced by North American Mustangs. The tactical reconnaissance and day intruder missions continued until July 1943, when the Squadron moved to Yorkshire and then in March 1944 to Scotland. In preparation for the Normandy landings, No. 26 trained in spotting naval guns, a task it carried out on and after D-Day. For this role the Squadron was equipped with Supermarine Spitfires although they reverted to Mustangs in December 1944 for reconnaissance missions over the Netherlands. In April 1945 the Squadron spent two weeks spotting for French warships bombarding pockets of German resistance before being transferred to Germany in August. No. 26 remained here until 1 April 1946 when it was disbanded. Post war Belvedere HC.1 of 26 Squadron in Aden On the same day, No. 41 Squadron was renumbered as No. 26 Squadron at Wunstorf and flew Spitfires and Hawker Tempests until April 1949, when it was re-equipped with de Havilland Vampires. In November 1953, now at RAF Oldenburg, No. 26 was converted to Sabres, converting again to Hunters in July 1955, and remained a day-fighter unit until it was disbanded on 10 September 1957. It was reformed with Hawker Hunters at RAF Gutersloh on 7 June 1958 but was disbanded again on 30 December 1960. Reformed again at RAF Odiham on 1 June 1962, No. 26 became a helicopter Squadron flying Bristol Belvederes. An advance party was moved to Aden in March 1963 and the remainder to RAF Kuching, Borneo in November 1963 for a one-year unaccompanied tour. The aircraft remaining in RAF Khormaksar in 1965 went to Singapore on 30 November 1965 where they were merged with No. 66 Squadron RAF, the ground crew going to No. 74 Squadron.

The piece premiered at the triennial Leeds Music Festival. At least 17 performances of the cantata were given in Britain during the first year after its premiere in October 1886, and during Sullivan's lifetime it was widely considered his greatest and most successful work of serious music. Indeed, outside of the comic operas with W. S. Gilbert, this cantata was widely regarded as Sullivan's most successful large-scale composition. A few days after the first performance, Gilbert wrote to Sullivan, \\"I congratulate you heartily on the success of the Cantata which appears from all accounts to be the biggest thing you've done.\\"Baily, p. 290 In May 1888, there was a performance of the work at the Royal Albert Hall by command of Queen Victoria. She sent for Sullivan after the performance and said, \\"At last I have heard The Golden Legend, Sir Arthur ... You ought to write a grand opera ‚Äì you would do it so well.\\"Sullivan's diary for 8 May 1888, quoted in Baily, p. 312 Numerous amateur choral societies performed the work, and at one point the composer declared a moratorium on its performance, fearing that it was becoming over-exposed. After Sullivan's death there was a steady decline in the frequency of performances of The Golden Legend, in common with all of his serious compositions, and the arrival of a new generation of composers, beginning with Edward Elgar, brought fresh new choral and symphonic works to the British musical scene that crowded out Romantic music. In recent decades, however, there has been a significant revival of interest in Sullivan's compositions, including The Golden Legend.Gordon- Powell, passim Background Sullivan had been associated with the prestigious triennial Leeds Music Festival, both as conductor and composer, since 1880, when his choral work The Martyr of Antioch had its premiere at Leeds Town Hall. By 1886, Sullivan was serving as the Leeds Festival's musical director for the third time, and the Festival Committee had commissioned him to compose a new choral work. In January 1886, having settled on his subject, but having tried and failed to arrange a libretto himself, he asked Joseph Bennett to prepare the librettoGordon-Powell, p. 11 based on Longfellow's epic poem The Golden Legend.Glasgow Herald, 1 February 1886Young, p. 221 Page from a proof score of The Golden Legend signed by Sullivan, 1886 Only weeks before Sullivan began composing The Golden Legend in the spring of 1886, Franz Liszt visited London.Young pp. 145‚Äì46 Sullivan had met Liszt many years earlier in Leipzig, when Sullivan was a student there,Young, pp.19‚Äì20 and he now escorted the older composer to functions given in his honour. During this visit, Liszt's music was heard in London, including his sacred cantata, The Legend of St Elisabeth.Jacobs (1984), pp. 232‚Äì33 Liszt had, in 1874, set the prologue of The Golden Legend as Die Glocken des Strassburger M√ºnsters, and some commentators assert that the influence of Liszt, and particularly of these two works, is discernible in Sullivan's cantata.Silverman, Richard S. \\"Longfellow, Liszt and Sullivan\\", The Musical Review, XXXVI (1975), reproduced at Deutsche Sullivan Gesellschaft, accessed 25 October 2012Young, p. 221; Burton, Nigel. \\"100 Years of a Legend\\", The Musical Times, 1 October 1986 pp. 554‚Äì57 With The Mikado drawing large audiences in London and New York, Sullivan began composing The Golden Legend in Yorktown, Camberley, England, on 24 April 1886, and rehearsals began on 10 September 1886.Site includes information about the background and score Like Sullivan's other Leeds Festival pieces, such as The Martyr of Antioch, the work was presented on a grand scale, with 325 voices and 120 orchestra players.Gordon-Powell, p. 21; later performances sometimes employed even larger forces.

The Prince and Elsie ‚Äì illustration to Longfellow's poem Scene one depicts Prince Henry of Hoheneck at his Castle of Vautsberg on the Rhine being tempted by Lucifer. Henry has been stricken with a strange malady, and the famous physicians of Salerno have told him that the only cure is the blood of a maiden who shall, of her own free will, consent to die for his sake. Viewing this as unlikely, he gives way to despair and allows Lucifer, disguised as a travelling physician, to administer alcohol to him in such measure that he is deprived of his position in society and power as a ruler, and becomes an outcast. In the second scene, Prince Henry finds shelter in the cottage of one of his vassals, Ursula, whose daughter, Elsie, moved by great compassion for him upon learning the cure for his illness, offers herself in sacrifice, despite her mother's misgivings. Elsie hopes that by giving her life for Henry, she will become closer to Christ. Elsie and Henry set out for Salerno. Scene three has Elsie and Henry travelling to Salerno, although Henry is disturbed by the fate that awaits Elsie. They pass a band of pilgrims, which is joined by a friar who is really Lucifer in disguise. Lucifer gloats over Elsie's fate, and Elsie and Henry find comfort in each other. The couple arrive in Salerno in scene four, where Lucifer reappears disguised as Friar Angelo, a doctor of the medical school. Despite the opposition of the Prince, who now declares that he intended to do no more than test her constancy, Elsie persists in her resolve to die for him. Lucifer plans to claim Elsie's soul for his own rather than let it rise to Heaven. He draws Elsie into an inner chamber, but at the last minute, Henry breaks down the door and rescues her from the \\"doctor\\" and eternal damnation. In the fifth scene, a forester brings the news to an anxious Ursula that her daughter is not dead. Miraculously healed, Prince Henry marries Elsie and is restored to his rightful place. The final scene finds Henry and Elsie on the evening of their wedding day. An epilogue provides the moral and explains that Prince Henry's malady was cured by love. Elsie's devotion is compared to the course of a mountain brook that cools and fertilises the arid plain.

British overseas territories=British Kenya British-ruled Kenya was the place of a rebellion from 1952 to 1960, an insurgency by Kenyan rebels against the British colonialist rule. The core of the rebellion was formed by members of the Kikuyu ethnic group, along with smaller numbers of Embu and Meru. French overseas territories The flag of Algeria French Algeria The colonization of Algeria: French colonization of Algeria began on June 14, 1830 when French soldiers arrived in a coastal town, Sidi Ferruch. The troops did not encounter significant resistance, and within 3 weeks, the occupation was officially declared on July 5, 1830. After a year of occupation over 3,000 Europeans (mostly French) had arrived ready to start businesses and claim land. In reaction to the French occupation, Amir Abd Al-Qadir was elected leader of the resistance movement. On November 27, 1832, Abd Al-Qadir declared that he reluctantly accepted the position, but saw serving in the position as a necessity in order to protect the country from the enemy (the French). Abd Al-Qadir declared the war against the French as jihad, opposed to liberation. Abd Al-Qadir's movement was unique from other independence movements because the main call to action was for Islam rather than nationalism. Abd Al-Qadir fought the French for nearly two decades, but was defeated when the Tijaniyya Brotherhood agreed to submit to French rule as long as ‚Äúthey were allowed to exercise freely the rites of their religion, and the honor of their wives and daughters was respected‚Äù. In 1847 Abd Al-Qadir was defeated and there were other resistance movements but none of them were as large nor as effective in comparison. Due to the lack of effective large-scale organizing, Algerian Muslims ‚Äúresorted to passive resistance or resignation, waiting for new opportunities,‚Äù which came about from international political changes due to World War I. As World War I became a reality, officials discussed drafting young Algerians into the army to fight for the French, but there was some opposition. European settlers were worried that if Algerians served in the army, then those same Algerians would want rewards for their service and claim political rights (Alghailani). Despite the opposition, the French government drafted young Algerians into the French army for World War I. Since many Algerians had fought as French soldiers during the First World War, just as the European settlers had suspected, Muslim Algerians wanted political rights after serving in the war. Muslim Algerians felt it was all the more unfair that their votes were not equal to the other Algerians (the settler population) especially after 1947 when the Algerian Assembly was created. This assembly was composed of 120 members. Muslim Algerians who represented about 9 million people could designate 50% of the Assembly members while 900,000 non- Muslim Algerians could designate the other half. Muslim mosque in Algeria Religion in Algeria: When the French arrived in Algeria in 1830, they quickly took control of all Muslim establishments. The French took the land in order to transfer wealth and power to the new French settlers. In addition to taking property relating Muslim establishments, the French also took individuals‚Äô property and by 1851, they had taken over 350,000 hectares of Algerian land. For many Algerians, Islam was the only way to escape the control of French Imperialism. In the 1920s and 30s, there was an Islamic revival led by the ulama, and this movement became the basis for opposition to French rule in Algeria. Ultimately, French colonial policy failed because the ulama, especially Ibn Badis, utilized the Islamic institutions to spread their ideas of revolution. For example, Ibn Badis used the ‚Äúnetworks of schools, mosques, cultural clubs, and other institutions,‚Äù to educate others, which ultimately made the revolution possible. Education became an even more effective tool for spreading their revolutionary ideals when Muslims became resistant to sending their children to French schools, especially their daughters. Ultimately, this led to conflict between the French and the Muslims because there were effectively two different societies within one country. Monument to those killed in the first independence protest Leading up to the fight for independence: The fight for independence, or the Algerian war, began with a massacre that occurred on May 8, 1945 in Setif, Algeria. After WWII ended, nationalists in Algeria, in alignment with the American anti-colonial sentiment, organized marches, but these marches became bloody massacres. An estimated 6,000-45,000 Algerians were killed by the French army. This event triggered a radicalization of Algerian nationalists and it was a crucial event in leading up to the Algerian War. In response to the massacre, Messali Hadj, the leader of the independence party, the Movement for the Triumph of Democratic Liberties (MTLD), \\"turned to electoral politics. With Hadj‚Äôs leadership, the party won multiple municipal offices. But, in the 1948 elections the candidates were arrested by Interior Minister Jules Moch. While the candidates were being arrested, the local authorities stuffed ballots for Muslim men, non-members of the independence party. Since the MTLD could not gain independence via elections, Hadj turned to violent means and consulted \\"the head of its parliamentary wing, Hocine A Ãàƒ±t Ahmed, to advise on how the party might win Algeria‚Äôs independence through force of arms.\\" A Ãàƒ±t Ahmed had never been formally trained in strategy, so he studied former rebellions against the French and he came to the conclusion that \\"no other anti-colonial movement had had to deal with such a sizable and politically powerful settler population.\\" Due to the powerful settler population, A Ãàƒ±t Ahmed believed that Algeria could only achieve independence if the movement became relevant in the international political arena. Over the next few years, members of the MTLD began to disagree about which direction the organization should go to achieve independence, so eventually the more radical members broke off to form the National Liberation Front (FLN). The fight for independence in the international arena: The FLN officially started the Algerian War for Independence and followed A Ãàƒ±t Ahmed's advice by creating tensions in the Franco-American relations. Due to the intensifying global relations, the Algerian War became a \\"kind of world war‚Äîa war for world opinion\\". In closed- door meetings the United States encouraged France to negotiate with the FLN, but during UN meetings the United States helped France end discussion on Algeria. Ultimately, the strategy of just focusing on superpowers was not successful for Algeria, but once A Ãàƒ±t Ahmed began to exploit international rivalries the Algerian war for independence was successful. Algerian women in the Algerian War of Independence Women in the fight for independence: Thousands of women took part in the war, even on deadly missions. Women took part as ‚Äúcombatants, spies, fundraisers, and couriers, as well as nurses, launderers, and cooks‚Äù. 3% of all fighters were women, which is roughly equivalent to 11,000 women. This is a quote of three women who participated in the war: ‚ÄúWe had visited the site and noted several possible targets. We had been told to place two bombs, but we were three, and at the last moment, since it was possible, we decided to plant three bombs. Samia and I carried three bombs from the Casbah to Bab el Oued, where they were primed...Each of us placed a bomb, and at the appointed time there were two explosions; one of the bombs was defective and didn‚Äôt go off.‚Äô - Djamila B., Zohra D., and Samia, Algiers, September 1956‚Äù. Outcome of Independence: Algeria gained independence on February 20, 1962 when the French government signed a peace accord. While the women's movement made significant gains post-independence, peace in the country did not last long. Shortly after gaining independence, the Algerian Civil War began. The civil war erupted from anger regarding one party rule and ever increasing unemployment rates in Algeria. In October 1988, young Algerian men took to the streets and participated in week-long riots. In addition, the Algerian war for independence inspired liberationists in South Africa. However, the liberationists were unsuccessful in implementing Alergian strategy into their independence movement. The Algerian Independence movement also had a lasting impact on French thought about the relationship between the government and religion. Portuguese overseas territories Portugal built a five-century-long global empire. Portuguese overseas expansion began in the 15th century, thanks to several factors that gave the small coastal nation an advantage over its larger European neighbours. First, in the 14th century, Portuguese shipbuilders invented several new techniques that made sailing in the stormy Atlantic Ocean more practical. They combined elements of different types of ships to construct stronger, roomier and more manoeuvrable caravels. They also took advantage of more reliable compasses for navigation, and benefited from the school for navigation created by Prince Henry the Navigator (1394‚Äì1460) at Sagres in 1419. Starting with voyages to Madeira and the Azores (islands in the Atlantic) in the first part of the 14th century, the Portuguese systematically extended their explorations as far as Japan by the 16th century. In the process, they established forts and settlements along the West and East African coasts. In the 16th through 18th centuries, the Portuguese lost their lead to other European nations, notably England and France, but played a major role in the slave trade to satisfy the demand for labour in Brazil and other American markets. By the beginning of the 19th century, Portugal controlled outposts at six locations in Africa. One was the Cape Verde Islands, located about 700 miles due west of Dakar, Senegal. Claimed for Portugal by Diogo Gomes about 1458, this archipelago of eight major islands was devoted to sugar cultivation using slaves taken from the African mainland. The Portuguese once had extensive claims on the West African coast‚Äîsince they were the first Europeans to explore it systematically‚Äîbut by 1800 they were left with only a few ports at the mouth of the Rio Geba in what is now known as the Guinea-Bissau. To the east, the Portuguese controlled the islands of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, located south of the mouth of the Niger River. Like the Cape Verde Islands, they were converted to sugar production in the early 16th century using slaves acquired on the mainland in the vicinity of the Congo River. By the end of the 19th century, Portuguese landowners had successfully introduced cocoa production using forced African labour. Further south, the Portuguese claimed both sides of the mouth of the Congo River, as well as the Atlantic coast as far south as the Rio Cunene. In practical terms, Portugal controlled port cities like those of Cabinda (north of the Congo River mouth), Ambriz (south of the Congo's mouth), Luanda and Benguela (on the Angolan coast) plus some river towns in the Angolan interior. The last area claimed by Portugal in Africa was along the southeast coast on either side of the mouth of the Zambezi River. After reaching this area, known as the Swahili Coast, at the end of the 15th century, the Portuguese came to dominate most of it by the end of the 16th century. During the 17th century, they lost control of everything north of Cape Delgado to Arabs from Oman (who established the Sultanate of Zanzibar), leaving them with major ports at Mozambique, Quelimane, and Louren√ßo Marques, plus settlements along the Zambezi and other rivers. Despite these holdings, the Portuguese hold in Africa was problematic. The first cause was the small size of Portugal's population, coupled with the lack of popular support for overseas empire. Exploration and conquest began as an enterprise supported by the nobility, and Portuguese peasants rarely participated unless forced to do so. When the common people of Portugal did chose to emigrate, they were much more likely to head to Brazil and other territories than to Africa. To induce Europeans to move to its African holdings, the Portuguese government resorted to releasing degradados‚Äîconvicted criminals‚Äîfrom prison in exchange for accepting what amounted to exile in Africa. Angola, in particular, gained a reputation as a Portuguese penal colony. Also, since the European population remained almost entirely male, the Portuguese birth rate was negligible, although plenty of \\"Afro-Lusitanians\\" were born to African mothers. As a result, the European population of Portugal's African settlements was never very large, and community leaders were just as likely to owe their loyalty to local African governments as they did to the distant Portuguese government. A second cause of weakness in Portuguese Africa was the effects of three centuries of Atlantic slave trade which had roots in the older African slave trade. Once the Atlantic triangular trade got underway, many Portuguese (including many Brazilian traders) in Africa found little incentive to engage in any other kind of profitable economic activity. The economies of Guinea, Angola and Mozambique became almost entirely devoted to the export of slaves to the New World (plus gold and ivory where they were available) while on the islands, slaves were used to grow sugar for export. Colonial authorities did nothing to stop the slave trade, which had sympathisers even among the several native African tribes, and many became wealthy by supporting it, while the traders themselves generated huge profits with which they secured allies in Africa and Portugal. Although anti-slavery efforts became organised in Europe in the 18th century, the slave trade only came to an end in the early 19th century, thanks in large part to English efforts to block shipping to the French during the Napoleonic Wars. Portugal was one of the first countries in the world to outlaw slavery, and did it so in mainland Portugal during the 18th century. The Portuguese government ended colonial slavery in stages with a final decree in 1858 that outlawed slavery in the overseas empire. The gradual pace of abolition was due to the strength of pro-slavery forces in Portuguese politics, Brazil and in Africa, they interfered with colonial administrators who challenged long- established and powerful commercial interests. The Napoleonic Wars added a new force to the Portuguese political scene‚Äîrepublicanism‚Äîintroduced as an alternative to the monarchy by French troops in 1807. The French invasion induced the Portuguese royal family to make the controversial decision to flee to Brazil (on English ships), from where they ruled until 1821. By the time King Jo√£o VI returned to Lisbon, he faced a nobility divided in their support for him personally, plus a middle class that wanted a constitutional monarchy. During Joao VI's reign (1821‚Äì1826) and that of his successors‚ÄîPeter IV (1826‚Äì1831), Maria (1833‚Äì1853), Peter V (1853‚Äì1861), Louis I (1861‚Äì1889), and Carlos (1889‚Äì1908)‚Äîthere was a civil war that lasted from 1826 to 1834, a long period characterised by what one author called \\"ministerial instability and chronic insurrection\\" from 1834 to 1853, and finally the end of the monarchy when both Carlos and his heir were assassinated on February 1, 1908. Under those circumstances, colonial officials appointed by governments in Lisbon were more concerned with politics at home than with administering their African territories. As it did everywhere else, the Industrial Revolution stimulated change in Portuguese Africa. It created a demand for tropical raw materials like vegetable oils, cotton, cocoa and rubber, and it also created a need for markets to purchase the expanded quantity of goods issuing from factories. In Portugal's case, most of the factories were located in England, which had had a special relationship with Portugal ever since Philippa, the daughter of England's John of Gaunt, married John of Avis, the founder of the Portuguese second dynasty. Prodded by Napoleon's invasion and English support for the royal family's escape to Brazil, King Jo√£o and his successors eliminated tariffs, ended trade monopolies and generally opened the way for British merchants to become dominant in the Portuguese empire. At times, that caused friction, such as when both British and Portuguese explorers claimed the Shire Highlands (located in modern Malawi), but for the most part Great Britain supported the Portuguese position in exchange for incorporating Portugal's holdings into the British economic sphere. With neither a large European population nor African wage earners, the Portuguese colonies offered poor markets for manufactured goods from the private sector. Consequently, industrialisation arrived in the form of government programs designed to improve internal communications and increase the number of European settlers. During the late 1830s, the government headed by Marquis S√° da Bandeira tried to encourage Portuguese farmers to migrate to Angola, with little success. Between 1845 and 1900, the European population of Angola rose from 1,832 to only about 9,000. European migration to Mozambique showed slightly better results‚Äîabout 11,000 in 1911‚Äîbut many were British from South Africa rather than Portuguese. The other major force for change was the rivalries that developed between European nations in the century between the end of the Napoleonic Wars and the outbreak of World War I. Forbidden from fighting each other by the \\"balance of power\\" established by the Treaty of Vienna, they competed in other ways including scientific discoveries, athletic competitions, exploration and proxy wars. Although not a major power anymore, Portugal participated in the competition, especially by sending out explorers to solidify their claim to all of the land between Angola and Mozambique. That bought them into conflict with men like Cecil Rhodes, whose own vision of an empire from \\"Cape to Cairo\\" required that the British gain control over the same land (see British Ultimatum). European rivalries appeared most often as commercial competition, and in 19th century Africa, that included the right to move goods by steamboat along rivers. The British had a head start thanks to their early adoption of steam technology and their supremacy on the high seas. They became the strongest proponents of the principle of \\"free trade\\" which prohibited countries from creating legal barriers to another country's merchants. Occasionally, Portuguese leaders resisted, but the British alliance provided sufficient benefits to convince various administrations to go along (although they faced revolts at home and in their colonies). It was Portugal's claim to the land on either side of the mouth of the Congo River that triggered the events leading up to the Congress of Berlin. That claim, which dated from Diogo C√£o's voyage in 1484, gave Portugal places from which naval patrols could control access to Africa's largest river system. The British eyed this arrangement with suspicion for years, but paid tariffs (like everyone else) for the right to trade there, mostly for slaves. After the abolition of slavery got underway, the Portuguese dragged their heels, so in 1839 the British government declared its right to inspect Portuguese ships for evidence of slave trading with or without Portuguese consent. That stirred the Portuguese to action, and in a subsequent series of agreements made in the 1840s, the British acquired the right to land their ships to land where no Portuguese authorities were present. When the Portuguese refused to renew the agreement in 1853, the British ceased paying tariffs at the ports on either side of the Congo River mouth, claiming that Portugal's claim had expired because they had left the area unoccupied for too long. Portugal reoccupied the ports of Cabinda and Ambriz in 1855, and relations with Great Britain improved after that. The dispute set a precedent, however, that effective occupation was a prerequisite for recognition of colonial claims. The question continued to reappear until 1885 when it was enshrined in the agreements that emanated from the Congress of Berlin. The final straw was the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty signed on February 26, 1884. It granted exclusive navigation rights on the Congo River to Britain in exchange for British guarantees of Portugal's control of the coast at the mouth of the Congo River. Most significantly, it prevented the French from taking advantage of treaties signed by one of its explorers (Savorgnan de Brazza) with Africans living along the north side of the Congo River. International protests forced the two countries to abandon the treaty in June 1884, and Bismarck used the controversy to call the Congress of Berlin later that year. The Portuguese were the first Europeans to claim territory in sub-Saharan Africa, and their example inspired imitation from other European powers. For the British, the Portuguese were acceptable proxies in the competition with France, Russia and Germany for world domination. For Portuguese governments, the British alliance gave them influence that they could not command themselves, while the idea of a Portuguese empire offered something with which to distract domestic opponents from the struggles initiated by the Napoleonic Wars. The issues that were raised by Portugal's claims in Africa and the efforts of other countries to whittle them down became the fundamental issues of the Congress of Berlin. In the end, the Congress settled more than the future of Portugal's African holdings‚Äîit also set the rules for any European government which wished to establish an empire in Africa. In the 1950s, after World War II, several African territories became independent from their European rulers, but the oldest Europe-ruled territories, those ruled by Portugal, were rebranded \\"Overseas Provinces\\" from the former designation as Portuguese colonies. This was a firm effort of Portugal's authorities to preserve its old African possessions abroad and refuse any claims of independence. This was followed by a wave of strong economic and social developments in all Portuguese Africa, in particular the overseas provinces of Angola and Mozambique. By the 1960s, several organisations were founded to support independence's claims of the Portuguese overseas provinces in Africa. They were mostly entirely based and supported from outside Portugal's territories. Headquartered and managed in countries like Senegal, Tanzania, Algeria, Guinea and Ethiopia, these guerrilla movements sought weapons, financing and political support in Eastern Bloc's communist states and the People's Republic of China. A Cold War conflict in Portuguese Africa was about to start. Marxist-Leninist and Maoist ideologies, backed by countries like the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China were behind the nationalist guerrilla movements created to attack Portuguese possessions and claim independence. The USA and other countries, in order to counter communist growing influence in the region also started to support some nationalist guerrillas in their fight against Portugal. The series of guerrilla wars involving Portugal and several armed nationalist groups from Africa in its overseas provinces of Angola, Guinea, and Mozambique, become known as the Portuguese Colonial War (Guerra Colonial or Guerra do Ultramar). African nationalism in Portuguese AfricaPortuguese Angola= Portuguese soldiers in Angola. In Portuguese Angola, the rebellion of the ZSN was taken up by the Uni√£o das Popula√ß√µes de Angola (UPA), which changed its name to the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) in 1962. On February 4, 1961, the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) took credit for the attack on the prison of Luanda, where seven policemen were killed. On March 15, 1961, the UPA, in a tribal attack, started the massacre of white populations and black workers born in other regions of Angola. This region would be retaken by large military operations that, however, would not stop the spread of the guerrilla actions to other regions of Angola, such as Cabinda, the east, the southeast and the central plateaus. =Portuguese Guinea= PAIGC's checkpoint in 1974 In Portuguese Guinea, the Marxist African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) started fighting in January 1963. Its guerrilla fighters attacked the Portuguese headquarters in Tite, located to the south of Bissau, the capital, near the Corubal river . Similar actions quickly spread across the entire colony, requiring a strong response from the Portuguese forces. The war in Guinea placed face to face Am√≠lcar Cabral, the leader of PAIGC, and Ant√≥nio de Sp√≠nola, the Portuguese general responsible for the local military operations. In 1965 the war spread to the eastern part of the country and in that same year the PAIGC carried out attacks in the north of the country where at the time only the minor guerrilla movement, the Frente de Luta pela Independ√™ncia Nacional da Guin√© (FLING), was fighting. By that time, the PAIGC started receiving military support from the Socialist Bloc, mainly from Cuba, a support that would last until the end of the war. In Guinea the Portuguese troops mainly took a defensive position, limiting themselves to keeping the territories they already held. This kind of action was particularly devastating to the Portuguese troops who were constantly attacked by the forces of the PAIGC. They were also demoralised by the steady growth of the influence of the liberation supporters among the population that was being recruited in large numbers by the PAIGC. With some strategic changes by Ant√≥nio Sp√≠nola in the late 1960s, the Portuguese forces gained momentum and, taking the offensive, became a much more effective force. Between 1968 and 1972, the Portuguese forces took control of the situation and sometimes carried attacks against the PAIGC positions. At this time the Portuguese forces were also adopting subversive means to counter the insurgents, attacking the political structure of the nationalist movement. This strategy culminated in the assassination of Am√≠lcar Cabral in January 1973. Nonetheless, the PAIGC continued to fight back and pushed the Portuguese forces to the limit. This became even more visible after PAIGC received anti- aircraft weapons provided by the Soviets, especially the SA-7 rocket launchers, thus undermining the Portuguese air superiority. =Portuguese Mozambique= Portuguese Mozambique was the last territory to start the war of liberation. Its nationalist movement was led by the Marxist-Leninist Liberation Front of Mozambique (FRELIMO), which carried out the first attack against Portuguese targets on September 24, 1964, in Chai, province of Cabo Delgado. The fighting later spread to Niassa, Tete at the centre of the country. A report from Battalion No. 558 of the Portuguese army makes references to violent actions, also in Cabo Delgado, on August 21, 1964. On November 16 of the same year, the Portuguese troops suffered their first losses fighting in the north of the country, in the region of Xilama. By this time, the size of the guerrilla movement had substantially increased; this, along with the low numbers of Portuguese troops and colonists, allowed a steady increase in FRELIMO's strength. It quickly started moving south in the direction of Meponda and Mandimba, linking to Tete with the aid of Malawi. Until 1967 the FRELIMO showed less interest in Tete region, putting its efforts on the two northernmost districts of the country where the use of landmines became very common. In the region of Niassa, FRELIMO's intention was to create a free corridor to Zamb√©zia. Until April 1970, the military activity of FRELIMO increased steadily, mainly due to the strategic work of Samora Machel in the region of Cabo Delgado. In the early 1970s, after the Portuguese Gordian Knot Operation, the nationalist guerrilla was severely damaged. =Role of the Organisation of African Unity= The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) was founded May 1963. Its basic principles were co-operation between African nations and solidarity between African peoples. Another important objective of the OAU was an end to all forms of colonialism in Africa. This became the major objective of the organisation in its first years and soon OAU pressure led to the situation in the Portuguese colonies being brought up at the UN Security Council. The OAU established a committee based in Dar es Salaam, with representatives from Ethiopia, Algeria, Uganda, Egypt, Tanzania, Zaire, Guinea, Senegal and Nigeria, to support African liberation movements. The support provided by the committee included military training and weapon supplies. The OAU also took action in order to promote the international acknowledgement of the legitimacy of the Revolutionary Government of Angola in Exile (GRAE), composed of the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA). This support was transferred to the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and to its leader, Agostinho Neto in 1967. In November 1972, both movements were recognised by the OAU in order to promote their merger. After 1964, the OAU recognised PAIGC as the legitimate representatives of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde and in 1965 recognised FRELIMO for Mozambique. Eritrea Eritrea sits on a strategic location along the Red Sea, between the Suez Canal and the Bab-el-Mandeb. Eritrea was an Italian colony from 1890‚Äì1941. On April 1, 1941, the British captured Asmara defeating the Italians and Eritrea fell under the British Military Administration. This military rule lasted from 1941 until 1952. On December 2, 1950, the United Nations General Assembly, by UN Resolution 390 A(V) federated Eritrea with Ethiopia. The architect of this federal act was the United States. The federation went into effect September 11, 1952. However, the federation was a non-starter for feudal Ethiopia, and it started to systematically undermine it. On December 24, 1958‚Äîthe Eritrean flag was replaced by the Ethiopian flag; On May 17, 1960‚ÄîThe title \\"Government of Eritrea\\" of the Federation was changed to \\"Administration of Eritrea\\". Earlier Amharic was declared official language in Eritrea replacing Tigrinya and Arabic. Finally on November 14, 1962 -‚Äì Ethiopia officially annexed Eritrea as its 14th province. The people of Eritrea, after finding out peaceful resistance against Ethiopia's rule was falling on deaf ears formed the Eritrean Liberation Movement (ELM) which was formed in 1958. The founders of these independence movement were: Mohammad Said Nawud, Saleh Ahmed Iyay, Yasin al-Gade, Mohammad al-Hassen and Said Sabr. ELM members were organised in secret cells of seven. The movement was known as Mahber Shewate in Tigrinya and as Harakat Atahrir al Eritrea in Arabic. On July 10, 1960, a second independence movement, the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF) was founded in Cairo. Among its founders were: Idris Mohammed Adem, President, Osman Salih Sabbe, Secretary General, and Idris Glawdewos as head of military affairs. These were among those who made up the highest political body known as the Supreme Council. On September 1, 1961, Hamid Idris Awate and his ELF unit attacked an Ethiopian police unit in western Eritrea (near Mt. Adal). This heralded the 30-year Eritrean war for independence. Between March and November 1970, three core groups that later made up the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) split from the ELF and established themselves as separate units. In September 1974, Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown by a military coup in Ethiopia. The military committee that took power in Ethiopia is better known by its Amharic name the Derg. After the military coup the Derg broke ties with the U.S. and realigned itself with the USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) and the USSR and its eastern bloc allies replaced America as patrons of Ethiopia's aggression against Eritrea. Between January and July 1977, the ELF and EPLF armies had liberated 95% of Eritrea capturing all but 4 towns. However, in 1978‚Äì79, Ethiopia mounted a series of five massive Soviet- backed offensives and reoccupied almost all of Eritrea's major towns and cities, except for Nakfa. The EPLF withdrew to a mountain base in northern Eritrea, around the town of Nakfa. In 1980 the EPLF had offered a proposal for referendum to end the war, however, Ethiopia, thinking it had a military upper hand, rejected the offer and war continued. In February‚ÄìJune 1982, The EPLF managed to repulse Ethiopia's much heralded four-month \\"Red Star\\" campaign (aka the 6th offensive by Eritreans) inflicting more than 31,000 Ethiopian casualties. In 1984 the EPLF started its counter-offensive and cleared the Ethiopian from the North-eastern Sahil front. In March 1988 the EPLF demolished the Ethiopian front at Afabet in a major offensive the British Historian Basil Davidson compared to the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu. In February 1990 the EPLF liberated the strategic port of Massawa and in the process destroyed a portion of the Ethiopian Navy. A year later the war came to conclusion on May 24, 1991, when the Ethiopian army in Eritrea surrendered. Thus Eritrea's 30-year war crowned with victory. On May 24, 1993, after a UN- supervised referendum on April 23‚Äì25, 1993, in which the Eritrean people overwhelmingly, 99.8%, voted for independence, Eritrea officially declared its independence and gained international recognition. Namibia South African soldiers pose with a captured German flag after their successful invasion of South-West Africa in 1915. At the onset of World War I, the Union of South Africa participated in the invasion and occupation of several Allied territories taken from the German Empire, most notably German South-West Africa and German East Africa (Tanzania). Germany's defeat forced the new Weimar Republic to cede its overseas possessions to the League of Nations as mandates. A mandate over South-West Africa was conferred upon the United Kingdom, \\"for and on behalf of the government of the Union of South Africa\\", which was to handle administrative affairs under the supervision of the league. South-West Africa was classified as a \\"C\\" mandate, or a territory whose population sparseness, small size, remoteness, and geographic continuity to the mandatory power allowed it to be governed as an integral part of the mandatory itself. Nevertheless, the League of Nations obliged South Africa to promote social progress among indigenous inhabitants, refrain from establishing military bases there, and grant residence to missionaries of any nationality without restriction. Article 7 of the South-West Africa mandate stated that the consent of the league was required for any changes in the terms of the mandate. With regards to the local German population, the occupation was on especially lenient terms; South Africa only repatriated civil and military officials, along with a small handful of political undesirables. Other German civilians were allowed to remain. In 1924 all white South-West Africans were automatically naturalised as South African nationals and British subjects thereof; the exception being about 260 who lodged specific objections. In 1926 a Legislative Assembly was created to represent German, Afrikaans, and English-speaking white residents. Control over basic administrative matters, including taxation, was surrendered to the new assembly, while matters pertaining to defence and native affairs remained in the hands of an administrator-general. Following World War II, South-West Africa's international status after the dissolution of the League of Nations was questioned. The United Nations General Assembly refused South Africa permission to incorporate the mandate as a fifth province, largely due to its controversial policy of racial apartheid. At the General Assembly's request the issue was examined at the International Court of Justice. The court ruled in 1950 that South Africa was not required to transfer the mandate to UN trusteeship, but remained obligated to adhere to its original terms, including the submission of annual reports on conditions in the territory. South African military convoy in Namibia, 1978.Led by newly elected Afrikaner nationalist Daniel Fran√ßois Malan, the South African government rejected this opinion and refused to recognise the competence of the UN to interfere with South-West African affairs. In 1960 Ethiopia and Liberia, the only two other former League of Nations member states in Africa, petitioned the Hague to rule in a binding decision that the league mandate was still in force and to hold South Africa responsible for failure to provide the highest material and moral welfare of black South-West Africans. It was pointed out that nonwhite residents were subject to all the restrictive apartheid legislation affecting nonwhites in South Africa, including confinement to reserves, colour bars in employment, pass laws, and influx control over urban migrants. A South African attempt to scupper proceedings by arguing that the court had no jurisdiction to hear the case was rejected; conversely, however, the court itself ruled that Ethiopia and Liberia did not possess the necessary legal interest entitling them to bring the case. In October 1966 the General Assembly declared that South Africa had failed to fulfill its obligations as the mandatory power and had in fact disavowed them. The mandate was unilaterally terminated on the grounds that the UN would now assume direct responsibility for South-West Africa. In 1967 and 1969 the UN called for South Africa's disengagement and requested the Security Council to take measures to oust the South African Defence Force from the territory that the General Assembly, at the request of black leaders in exile, had officially renamed Namibia. One of the greatest aggravating obstacles to eventual independence occurred when the UN also agreed to recognise the South West African People's Organization (SWAPO), then an almost exclusively Ovambo body, as the sole authentic representative of the Namibian population. South Africa was offended by the General Assembly's simultaneous dismissal of its various internal Namibian parties as puppets of the occupying power. Furthermore, SWAPO espoused a militant platform which called for independence through UN activity, including military intervention. By 1965 SWAPO's morale had been elevated by the formation of a guerrilla wing, the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN), which forced the deployment of South African Police troops along the long and remote northern frontier. The first armed clashes between PLAN cadres and local security forces took place in August 1966. See alsoReferences # Alghailani, Said A.

He was a consensus All-American in both 1934 and 1935.  Early life  Born in Portland, Oregon, Grayson was a football, track and baseball star at Jefferson High School. He was state 100-yard dash champion in 1931 at 10.1 seconds, and again in 1932 in 9.9 seconds with a career best of 9.8 seconds. Grayson also won the 220-yard low hurdles state championship twice, in 1931 he won in 26.6 seconds, and again in 1931 in 25.5 seconds. In football, he was a four year letterman playing fullback and defense while leading Jefferson to the 1931 City title and allowed no scores by opponents. In 1932, he was recruited to play football at Stanford by their legendary coach Pop Warner.  College career  Grayson's 1932 freshman team also included Bob Reynolds, Monk Moscrip and Bones Hamilton, and came to be known as the \\"Vow Boys\\". The 1932 Stanford varsity team was soundly defeated by the USC Trojans (USC). After watching the defeat, the freshmen players got together and vowed that they would never lose to the Trojans. In November 1933, Stanford defeated USC, and Grayson scored the Reskins' only touchdown. Time magazine reported that \\"Stanford's speedy Fullback Bobby Grayson slashed and passed through the Trojan line, punched over a touchdown\\", resulting in a \\"resounding crash\\" for \\"the fattest Humpty Dumpty of 1933 football.\\" The Stanford team proceeded to beat USC three straight years from 1933 to 1935 ‚Äì making good on the vow. Stanford was the dominant team on the Pacific Coast, appearing in the New Year's Day Rose Bowl game in each of those three years. In three seasons, Grayson was part of a Stanford team that compiled a 25‚Äì4‚Äì2 record and became the first team to play in three consecutive Rose Bowls. In the 1934 Rose Bowl, Grayson rushed for 152 yards, a Rose Bowl record. Ernie Nevers said Grayson was \\"the best back I've ever seen.\\" Grayson set numerous Stanford records. He set the record for most interceptions in a single game with four (two of which he returned for touchdowns) in a 1934 game against the University of Washington. His career total of 1,547 rushing yards in 405 carries established a Stanford record that stood for 20 years. A historical account of Grayson's accomplishments published by the LA84 Foundation notes: > Bobby Grayson had the looks of a matinee idol; and he remains as one of the > most publicized players in Pacific Coast football history. A member of the > legendary 'Vow Boys' of Stanford, Grayson starred from 1933‚Äì1935 in an era > that is regarded as the greatest in the school's gridiron history. A > workhorse ball carrier from the fullback spot, Grayson combined speed and > power in piling up the school's career reusing record that stood for nearly > two decades. Grayson used sprinter-class speed in sweeping the ends, and his > swivel-hipped moves eluded tacklers in the open field.; while he was as > adept at battering up the middle and punishing opposing defensive lines. Sportswriter Grantland Rice wrote of Grayson: > Here is a big, fast back who can run an end, hit a line, kick, pass, block > and handle any assignment given him. Grayson was the 21st player drafted in the 1936 NFL Draft ‚Äî the inaugural NFL draft. He was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates but did not play professional football.  Military service  Grayson served as commanding officer of the minesweeper USS Loyalty (AMc-88) in the Pacific during World War II.  Legacy  Grayson died of a heart ailment in 1981 at age 66 in Bellevue, Washington. He was survived by his wife, Sue Grayson, and a son, Dan Grayson. In 2003, the Oakland Tribune ranked Grayson as one of Stanford's top ten players of all time, ranking him at number five behind Ernie Nevers, Jim Plunkett, Frankie Albert, and John Elway.

She was the youngest daughter of vaudeville and Broadway legend George M. Cohan. She was born in New York City and studied at Marymount College in Tarrytown, New York and in France. At the age of 17 Helen appeared as a dancer at New York's Heckscher Theatre in the 1928 Dance Recital produced by Ned Wayburn. Her first appearance on the stage came during the run of The Merry Malones at Erlanger's Theatre. She danced with her father for one performance. In 1931, she joined her dad in his play Fast Friendships. The previous season, she played in the Kaufman-Lardner comedy June Moon. Miss Cohan spent five months in Hollywood hoping to break into motion pictures and then was signed to a contract by Fox Film in 1930. Her film credits are few; she had roles in Kiss and Make-Up (1934), The Penal Code (1932), and Lightnin' (1930). The latter movie featured Will Rogers. She was listed by the WAMPAS Organization of film publicity men as one of 33 young actresses nominated for its annual selection of 13 Baby Stars in March 1934. She once provided a beauty hint which was syndicated in 1936 newspapers. Helen suggested giving one's skin a rest from make-up whenever possible: \\"During the hours at home, cleanse the face thoroughly and then let the pores breath. Do this as faithfully as you do your morning exercises.\\" In August 1931, Edward Wallace Dunn left his entire estate of $5,000 to Helen Cohan. Dunn was employed as personal representative to her father during the final 25 years of his life. Miss Cohan was listed as residing at the Hotel Savoy Plaza in New York. The will was dated October 5, 1929. Dunn died at age 74. Upon his death on November 5, 1942, Cohan divided his estate equally among his widow and four children. The will, dated March 2, 1939, stated that the beneficiaries were to receive the principal of their trust funds in installments at specified ages, and under the codicil, if the income of any trust falls below $100 a month, the deficit may be made up out of the principal. Death Helen Cohan died in Los Angeles, California on the day after her 86th birthday in 1996.

Royal Air Force. Retrieved 30 October 2011. Torpedo bombers On 1 October 1928, No 36 Squadron was reformed by redesignating the Coast Defence Torpedo Flight, based at Donibristle in Scotland and flying Hawker Horsleys. It was sent to Singapore to strengthen its defences against naval attack, with its aircraft reaching its destination on 17 December 1930.Thetford Aeroplane Monthly November 1993, p. 35. As well as practicing torpedo attacks and working with the Royal Navy, 36 Squadron was deployed to Rangoon in response to a rebellion in Burma, carrying out bombing raids against the insurgents.Thetford Aeroplane Monthly November 1993, p. 36.Flight 11 March 1932, p. 214. The squadron was re-equipped with Vickers Vildebeests in July 1935, continuing as a torpedo bomber squadron operating from Singapore. Vickers Vildebeest Mk III of No. 36 Squadron in flight over Singapore. 22 September 1936 Second World War 36 Squadron, along with No. 100 Squadron RAF retained the obsolete biplanes when Japan invaded Malaya, and flew an unsuccessful attack against the Japanese cruiser Sendai during the Battle of Kota Bharu on 8 December 1941.Shores, Cull and Izawa 1992, pp. 80‚Äì84. It continued operating against the Japanese, its Vildebeests being supplemented by five ex-Fleet Air Arm Fairey Albacores.Shores, Cull and Izawa 1992, p. 146. Where possible it operated by night, bombing Japanese-held airfields and troops.Shores, Cull and Izawa 1992, pp. 286, 328, 337‚Äì338 On 26 January 1942, Japanese forces landed at Endau, on the east coast of Malaya, 150 miles from Singapore. To oppose this landing, nine Vildebeests of No 100 Squadron and three of 36 Squadron, together with nine Australian Lockheed Hudsons, set off at 1:00 pm (having flown against land targets the night before), and despite a fighter escort five Vildebeests were shot down. No 36 and 100 Squadrons repeated the attack two hours later with nine Vildebeests (with two from 100 SquadronShores, Cull and Izawa 1993, p. 29.) and three Albacores. This time the fighter escort was late, only finding the bomber force once it had been engaged by Japanese Nakajima Ki-27 fighters, with a further five Vildebeests and two Albacores shot down, and a further two more damaged so badly that they were written off.Mason 1994, p.202.Richards and Saunders 1954, p. 37.Flight 28 October 1955, p. 676.Shores, Cull and Izawa 1993, pp. 30‚Äì39. These losses--which included the commanding officers of both Squadrons--could not be sustained, and the remnants of the two squadrons were evacuated to Java on 31 January, being merged into a single unit. On 28 February, nine Videbeests attacked a Japanese convoy off Rembang in Northern Java, claiming eight ships sunk but losing another commanding officer. It ceased to exist on 7 March 1942 after its last two Vildebeests ditched off Sumatra while attempting to evacuate to Ceylon.Richards and Saunders 1954, p. 47.Thetford Aeroplane Monthly April 1995, pp. 38‚Äì39. No 36 Squadron reformed at Thanjavur in India on 22 October 1942, although it did not receive any aircraft until December that year when it was equipped with Vickers Wellington bombers for anti-submarine patrols off Madras. It flew its first convoy escort mission on 13 January 1943.Rawlings 1982, p. 60. It moved to Algeria in June 1943. One tactic used against German U-boats in the Mediterranean was known as \\"Swamp\\", the area around a sighting would be saturated with aircraft, keeping the submarine submerged and stopping it from charging its batteries. On 12 December 1943, the destroyer was torpedoed and sunk by the German submarine while escorting the convoy KMS 34 off Algeria. In response, the area was saturated by ships and aircraft. During the hunt, U-593 sank another destroyer, , before a Wellington of 36 Squadron detected the submarine on radar on the night of 12/13 December. While its attack was unsuccessful, its sighting report directed the destroyers and to the vicinity, where they sank U-593 by depth charging, the first submarine sunk by the \\"Swamp\\" tactic.Shores et al. 2018, pp. 464‚Äì465. On the night of 7/8 January 1943, a 36 Squadron Wellington sighted off the coast of southern Spain, but was shot down when it attempted to attack the submarine. A second 36 Squadron Wellington responded to the sighting report and attacked U-343, but was damaged by return fire from the submarine although it did manage to safely return to base. On the next night a third 36 Squadron aircraft found U-343 and directed two Wellingtons from 179 Squadron to attack, one of was shot down by the submarine, which after yet further attacks by a Catalina flying boat of 202 Squadron finally managed to escape and reach its base at Toulon.Shores et al. 2018, pp. 486, 488. Another example of the \\"swamp\\" tactic took place on 14‚Äì17 May 1944, when Leigh Light equipped Wellingtons of 36 Squadron made several attacks on U-616, which culminated in it being sunk by US Navy destroyers, while on 18 May a Wellington of No 36 Squadron sighted and attacked U-960 before directing the destroyers USS Ludlow and Niblack, which sank the U-boat.Blair 2000, pp. 524‚Äì526. It returned to RAF Chivenor in September 1944, continuing in the anti-submarine role. It disbanded at RAF Benbecula on 4 June 1945. Post-war operations On 1 October 1946, the squadron was reformed at Thorney Island by renumbering No. 248 Squadron, flying de Havilland Mosquitos, being disbanded again on 15 October 1947. The squadron was again reformed on 1 July 1953 as a maritime reconnaissance unit at RAF Topcliffe, flying Lockheed P-2 Neptunes until 28 February 1957. The following year, on 1 September, the squadron re-emerged at RAF Colerne as a transport squadron, flying the Handley Page Hastings previously operated by No. 511 Squadron RAF, and concentrating on tactical transport operations.Jackson 1989, pp. 49‚Äì51. In August 1967 the squadron relocated to RAF Lyneham and the Hastings were replaced by Lockheed C-130 Hercules. It was disbanded again on 3 November 1975.

The series takes place in a world reminiscent of ancient Korea, and follows the Korean-folktale-inspired adventures of Munsu, one of the few remaining guardians against corruption and tyranny, as he seeks to find those responsible for the destruction of his country. It was serialized from 2001 to 2007 in South Korea (as Shin amhaengosa) and in Japan (as Shin Angy≈ç Onshi), and was adapted into an animated theatrical-release film in 2004 in a first- of-its-kind collaboration between Japan and South Korea. In 2007, an English- language version of the film was released in the United States by ADV Films (licensed for $130,000http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-01-30/adv- court-documents-reveal-amounts-paid-for-29-anime-titles) under the title Blade of the Phantom Master. In 2008, the anime became one of over 30 ADV titles transferred to Funimation. Plot Blade of the Phantom Master takes place in the fictional land of Jushin, modeled after feudal Korea. In Jushin, there once lived secret government agents called the amheng osa (or angy≈ç onshi in the Japanese version), who traveled the countryside in disguise. They were charged by the king with finding and punishing corrupt government officials, and bringing justice to the country's citizens. At the start of the series, Jushin has been destroyed, fractured into numerous fiefdoms and kingdoms, many of which are ruled by corrupt and tyrannical warlords. Blade of the Phantom Master follows the adventures of one of the remaining amheng osa, Munsu, as he continues to wander the countryside and deals with the chaos caused by Jushin's fall. Though initially episodic in nature, it becomes apparent as the series progresses that Munsu's travels are not random. In truth, Munsu is searching for the man responsible for assassinating his best friend, the king of Jushin, an act that led to the fall of the country. But as Munsu grows closer to reaching his goal, he encounters old friends and comrades from his past, some who have since switched their allegiance to his enemy. Through them, it is revealed that Munsu was not always an amheng osa and is himself partly responsible for the king's death and subsequent fall of Jushin. In addition to the overarching plotline, the series also uses the exploits of Munsu and his companions to retell various Korean folk stories. Amheng Osa In Blade of the Phantom Master, amheng osa bear bronze medallions, given to them by the king and emblazoned with between one and three horses. The greater the number of horses, the higher the rank of the amheng osa. Amheng osa of first mahai rank have one horse emblazoned onto their medallions, which allows them to wield basic magic to fight ordinary soldiers. The most powerful medallions feature three horses, and allow the bearers, third mahai (, ‰∏âÈ¶¨Áâå), to perform summonings and regenerate injuries. Despite being made for use by amheng osa, the mahai medallions will also work for normal people, so long as their convictions and willpower in executing justice are sufficiently strong. Hong Gildong, for example, successfully wielded a fourth mahai medallion. After the fall of Jushin, both first and second mahai medallions were rendered useless; only third and fourth mahai medallions still functioned. Amheng osa are also prohibited from having families, but they are allowed a single travel partner called a 'Sando', who doubles as a bodyguard. Sando tend to be individuals of great fighting prowess or intelligent beasts. Characters ;Munsu (ÊñáÁßÄ/Î¨∏Ïàò) :The anti-heroic protagonist of the series, former military general, and a third mahai amen osa from the fallen kingdom of Jushin. Despite the common perception held by Jushin's former citizens that amen osa are virtuous and bearers of justice, Munsu usually comes across as somewhat amoral and does not believe in helping people who refuse to help themselves. When he does help others, his methods almost always involve excessive bloodshed, lying, torture, and other questionable acts. :Munsu suffers from a curse that resembles asthma, which can only be alleviated by the inhaler-like charm he wears around his neck. This curse originates from during the Jushin period, where he convinced Aji Tae to switch the curse which was originally suffered by his lover Kye Wol Hyang unto him in hopes of relieving her pain. However, this was ineffective; not only did she die in the end while he retained the curse, Munsu actually fell directly into Aji Tae's scheme. In volume 11, Munsu confessed to Wonsul that despite claims that he was her killer, the truth was that Kye Wol Hyang killed herself by running into his sword while he was holding it right into her heart. He blames himself for her death and believes that he is her killer. When asked by Hong Gildong, he refused to deny that he was her sister's killer although his life was at stake. He went against the entire Hwalbindang after consuming a special drug that removed his asthma for a period of time, and managed to kill most of them. However, the drug had negative side effects when it wore off, and conveniently Aji Tae appeared while Munsu was at his most weak and wounded moment. Seeing his sworn enemy, his condition worsened and he started vomiting more blood, falling into a more critical state. Munsu swears that he will not die despite reality and that he will find Aji Tae in the end. :Before passing out, he asks Bang Ja to use an acupuncture needle from his pocket in order to prevent his death, but as soon as Bang Ja did it, Munsu's heart stopped beating. Everyone lost hope and believed that he was dead; however, after a few days despite the humid weather, Munsu's body did not decay. Later it was discovered that the needle contained mandrake extract and Munsu was affected with the infamous hallucinogen, allowing him to escape death. But being affected by the mandrake's poison means he will forever live in a fake world of his most desired dreams where he happily living with his loved one. Volume 11 shows the most treasured moments in Munsu's life and more about his past, including his relationship with Kye Wol Hyang. :After waking up from his dream-world, Munsu realizes that the mandrake extract has cancelled out his curse and he realizes that he only has a few more days to live. Munsu calls in favors from his allies and launches a massive attack on Aji Tae's castle. Although Munsu is victorious in killing his nemesis, he succumbs to his ailments and dies. In the last chapter, Munsu is reunited with his lover and friends in the afterlife. ;Sando/Chun Hyang (Â±±ÈÅì/Êò•È¶ô/ÏÇ∞ÎèÑ/Ï∂òÌñ•) :A beautiful girl with prodigious fighting skill. She acts as Munsu's 'Sando', or bodyguard. When she was kidnapped by a corrupt lord who wanted to make her his personal bodyguard, her lover embarked on a futile quest to become an amen osa. He died in the process, but not before making Munsu aware of her plight. After Munsu frees her, she decides to become his bodyguard in memory of her dead lover, and takes the title \\"Sando\\" as her new name. :Despite her fearsome natural fighting ability, Sando is quiet and shy, with a high moral stance. As a result, she is often in conflict with the amoral Munsu over his questionable methods. She has made it clear that if he ever becomes truly evil, she will no longer protect him. She also has a great fear of heights, and will refuse to cross bridges set over deep mountain gorges or valleys. Munsu finds this extremely peculiar, seeing as to how she often leaps several stories into the air during combat. :Together with Munsu and Bang Ja, Sando helps fight corruption. Although she is still hesitant about Munsu's methods, she learns to trust him, and Munsu in turn relies on her more than ever. :Later in the series, she is defeated in combat and leaves Munsu in shame to pursue greater strength. She learns the power of using her 'ki' from a friend of Aji Tae, attaining the strength she desires. She becomes devastated after she hears about the \\"death\\" of Munsu from Aji Tae and he manipulates her into becoming his latest bodyguard. :When Munsu storms the castle to kill Aji Tae, she originally fights him, chopping off one of his arms. However, Munsu is able to help her remember their memories and friendship. Together, they fight Aji Tae, and Sando is the one who kills him. When Munsu dies in the castle, Sando grieves. :After the two-month time-skip, it is revealed from Bang Ja's letters that Sando has parted ways and is still using her fighting skills to extinguish evil. ;Bang Ja (ÊàøÂ≠ê/Î∞©Ïûê) :Munsu's unwanted but good-intentioned servant. Once the servant and apprentice of a first mahai onshi, his former master released him from service after Jushin's destruction. When his master and his sando were later killed in a rebel uprising against a corrupt lord, Bang Ja began roaming the country as a thief. He believes that amen osa should be virtuous and heroic, which is why Munsu's behavior often shocks him. :He is a third-rate Magician who summons animals to do his bidding, and he deeply takes his role as a Bang Ja seriously. This often leads to his being manipulated and bullied by Munsu, who often beats him or sends him on inane/impossible errands. :He was responsible for the main death of Won Hyo. After Sando left the group and Munsu almost died, Bang Ja used Yuui Tae's acupuncture needle on Munsu so that he lives. Bang Ja finds it difficult that Munsu is in a coma state situation that he is a lifeless body. After Yeongsil received the false information about the Mandrake cure, Bang Ja and Yeongsil traveled together to an icy mountain encountering Sando. Having joined Aji Tae, Sando attacked Bang Ja and Yeongsil. In order to save his life, Yeongsil injects Bang Ja with a drug that makes Bang Ja appear dead. Fortunately, Bang Ja recovers when he hears Munsu's voice. :In the battle at Aji Tae's castle, Bang Ja helps Munsu create a diversion. After Aji Tae's defeat and Munsu's death, Bang Ja writes a letter to Munsu, recommitting himself to fight for the ideal world that Munsu had talked about. ;Kye Wol Hyang (Ê°ÇÊúàÈ¶ô/Í≥ÑÏõîÌñ•) :Is Munsu's deceased lover and sister of Hong Gildong. She is Munsu and Hae Mo Su's childhood friend. She has an illness that resembles asthma, which can only be alleviated by the inhaler-like charm he wears around his neck. Munsu couldn't stand and watch Kye Wol Hyang suffer so he asked Aji Tae to perform a ritual to pass Kye Wol Hyang's illness to Munsu. Later it is known that Kye Wol Hyang committed suicide but Munsu still blames himself for her death even when Hong Gildong asks for the truth. ;Won Sul (ÂÖÉËø∞/ÏõêÏà†) :A master swordsman from Jushin, who was once a subordinate of Munsu. However, when Jushin fell he began serving Aji Tae, growing Yang Gwi Bi, a plant with narcotic properties, to ship to the west in exchange for weaponry. His weapon, Saruhyondo, is a sword with a blade forged from his killing 'ki', or killing intent. Aside from being impossibly sharp and hard, the blade is also extremely malleable, re-shaping itself into any killing form Wonsul can imagine. As it is made of pure killing ki, the blade is also invisible to the naked eye. Wonsul can manifest the blade so long as he has something to act as a hilt, such as a stick or his signature dragon's head sword hilt. :While working for Aji Tae, Wonsul was defeated and killed by Sando, while temporarily confused by her possession of Aji Tae's lucky charm. His death, however, proved temporary, as he was later resurrected by Aji Tae. Now effectively a zombie of sorts, Wonsul retained his mind and skill, but his body was like a living corpse, continuing to decay. Furthermore, his re-animated form proved extremely hard to kill, since it was already technically dead - even when decapitated, he still remained conscious and fully aware. He went on to serve as Munsu's sando in Chun Hyang's stead. When Munsu went against the Hwalbindang, Wonsul remained by his side. As their battle with the Hwalbindang comes, Aji Tae made his appearance, upon which Wonsul requested that the former end his state of living death. At first Aji Tae appears to oblige, disintegrating Wonsul's body. However, Aji Tae then states that so long as even part of his body remains intact, he wants Wonsul to remain alive, and \\"see everything through to the end\\". At this, Wonsul's head, the only remaining part of his body, begins to cry. :Later, when Munsu recovers from his mandrake-induced coma and prepares for a final battle with Aji Tae, Wonsul is dispatched to attack. Despite having been turned into an immense, grotesque mass of flesh (he is initially mistaken for one of Kaidaiten's demons), Munsu recognises his old friend and grants Wonsul his wish, exploding a nearby ammunition dump and engulfing the monstrosity in the blast. Back in his fortress, Aji Tae comments that Wonsul is finally dead. :After Munsu's death, Won Sul jokes with Munsu in the afterlife. ;Aji Tae (ÈòøÂøóÊ≥∞/ÏïÑÏßÄÌÉú) :A former scholar from Jushin and the man Munsu holds responsible for the destruction of the country. Many of Munsu's former allies and comrades have since switched their loyalties to Aji Tae, having been coerced by his power or duped by his charisma. His motives and purpose remain unknown. He possesses a large range of magical abilities, among them the ability to resurrect the dead, explode people with a mere glance, shapeshifting, and teleportation. :During the Junshin period, Aji Tae was General Munsu's second- in-command. At that time, he was smaller in size and sported short black hair and glasses. Despite his innocent exterior, however, the Jushin Aji Tae was already convinced of the inferiority and unworthiness of mankind, and was already plotting his conquest of Jushin. :As of volume 15, he has succeeded in conquering most of the former Jushin territories, having gathered together a formidable force of supernatural allies. This includes the resurrected Kaidaiten and its demon brood, an army of undead, black magic practitioners from the West, and Munsu's former bodyguard Sando. Series origins Much of the premise for and characters of Blade of the Phantom Master were drawn from the classic Korean tale, The Legend of Chun Hyang. Youn said many Korean readers of the comic did not like his dark portrayal of the light-hearted classic tale, and he was sometimes told he had \\"bad taste.\\" He explained that Blade of the Phantom Mask used the original, lesser-known version of The Legend of Chun Hyang, which is far more tragic, as its basis. He sought to not only draw on the beauty of the original novel, but also to arrange its message to fit modern times. Youn also drew upon other classic Korean stories, such as Amhaengeosa (Secret royal inspector), and historical figures like Heo Jun for inspiration. The model for Munsu was the historical figure Park Mun-su, from Korea's Joseon Dynasty period. According to Youn, he was originally a military officer in charge of training the army, and was active as an amen osa for only one year. However, his legacy was considerable, including not only seeking and punishing corrupt officials, but also stopping the invasion of the Korean peninsula by foreigners and saving the king from a coup d'√©tat. Sando is based largely on Ju Non-gae, a figure from the Japanese-Korean Seven-Year War. Following the capture of Hanyang (now Seoul) by Toyotomi Hideyoshi's troops in 1592, Non-gae avenged the death of her lover, a soldier, by willingly giving up her life to cause the death of a Japanese general. The holiday Uiambeolje commemorates her spirit of patriotic self-sacrifice. When developing the idea of using a story about amen osa, Youn said he worried that Japanese readers might find the idea too foreign. He later learned that Japan had similar people, called mito koumon, in its history, and eventually found that many places around the world had individuals of similar positions in their own histories. He felt this universality of such heroes who seek out and report corrupt government officials showed that good and evil don't differentiate between countries, races, or cultures. Youn admits to being influenced his portrayal of amen osa by Rich≈ç Angy≈çki (ÊùéÊúùÊöóË°åË®ò), a Japanese manga by Natsuki Sumeragi. While a bit embarrassed at being so affected by a foreigner's portrayal of Korean history, he was impressed and surprised by the manga's historical accuracy. Media=Comic The Blade of the Phantom Master comic was serialized from 2001 to 2007. In Japan, the series ran from April 2001 April to September 2007 as manga in Monthly Sunday Gene-X. It was also published as manhwa in South Korea's Young Champ. The work was collected into 17 graphic novel volumes, which were published by Shogakukan in Japan and Daiwon C.I. in South Korea. As of 2005, these collections have sold over 2 million copies between the two countries. Translation of the comic from Korean to Japanese was provided by Manabu Okazaki. Many chapters included special author's notes to give background on Korean folktales and historical figures referenced in the story, and to explain instances in which the author chose to deviate from generally accepted fact in his portrayals. For instance, in volume 4, Youn provided information on Hwanung, a sage from the Korean legend, Dangun Shinhwa. He feared his portrayal of Hwanung as a summoned creature dressed in S&M; gear might cause misunderstandings among readers of the comic, and explained that his development of the character in the comic was influenced by interesting but unsupported statements from the internet, whereas the Hwanung of legend holds a very high status in Korea, on a par with \\"that of Jesus Christ in Western society.\\" Japanese editions of the comic volumes also included omake-style humorous shorts detailing a variety of Youn and Yang's cross cultural and comic writing adventures, entitled \\"From Korea - Hello!!\\" Youn and Yang maintained their residences in Incheon, South Korea throughout most of the writing and publication of the series, often requiring the services of translators for dealings with their Japanese editor, Akinobu Natsume, especially early on, and necessitating multiple business trips to Japan. Youn studied Japanese and his proficiency improved as the comic progressed. He admitted, however, that it \\"took two hours while staring at a dictionary\\" to read his first Japanese-language fan letter. Japanese editions of volume 8 of the comic were packaged with a bonus booklet entitled Osa-logy. It contained a short side story by the series authors, plus humorous comic shorts by guest authors and artists. Contributors included Airi Kawauchi (Ê≤≥ÂÜÖÊÑõÈáå Kawauchi Airi), Minoru Murao, It≈ç Shin (Áúü‰ºäÊù± Shin It≈ç), and Kazuhiko Shimamoto. Also included were interviews between author Youn and actress Yoon Son-ha, and between Youn and the manga authors CLAMP (creators of The Legend of Chun Hyang, among other titles). A guidebook entitled Amenosa, This Reality and Mission („Ç¢„É°„É≥„Ç™„Çµ„ÄÅ„Åù„ÅÆÁúüÂÆü„Å®‰ΩøÂëΩ Amenosa, sono shinjitsu to shimei, Í≥µÏãù Í∞ÄÏù¥ÎìúÎ∂Å) was also published, containing color art galleries by artist Yang, plus story summaries and character data. A \\"gaiden\\"-style volume of two side stories was also released for sale. Since its original releases in South Korea and Japan, the comic has been licensed and published in French as Le Nouvel Angyo Onshi by Pika √âdition, in Hungarian as √Årnyb√≠r√≥ by Mangafan, in German as Shin Angyo Onshi by Carlsen Comics, in Thai as Dt√≤o Laa Gaan T√°-mil Ch√†-b√†p P√≠-s√®t (‡∏ï‡∏∏‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏ó‡∏°‡∏¥‡∏¨ ‡∏â‡∏ö‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏û‡∏¥‡πÄ‡∏®‡∏©) by Vibulkij, in Indonesian as Shin Angyo Onshi by Level Comics, and in Chinese by Jonesky (Hong Kong) and Sharp Point Press (Taiwan). No English-language adaptations have been published or announced as licensed. Animated film In 2004, Japanese studio Oriental Light and Magic and Korean studio Character Plan collaborated to create an animated film adaptation of the comic, entitled Phantom Master: Dark Hero from the Ruined Empire. The project represented the first time Korean and Japanese creators had ever collaborated on an animated film, and funding was shared by sources from both nations. It was distributed by The Klockworx in Japan and Cinema Service in Korea. The film was co-directed by Ahn Tae-gun and J≈çji Shimura, and produced by Yang Jae-hye, Lee Sang-don, Bunsho Kajiya, Lee Don-ki, and Shukuchi Kanda. It featured a musical score from composer Kow Otani and theme songs performed by BoA. Vocal tracks were recorded in both Korean and Japanese, though Korean actor Ji Sung's narration was retained in its original language for the Japanese release and augmented with native subtitles. Character Plan president Yang Jee-hye said his company was able to learn new skills and technologies, both of which have been maintained during Japan's long history of film-making, from Oriental Light and Magic, who completed about 70% of the work on the film. Phantom Master: Dark Hero from the Ruined Empire was shown at the Sixth Bucheon International Animation Festival, 6 November 2004, in Bucheon, South Korea, at which it served as the opening film. It was released into theaters simultaneously in Japan and Korea on 26 November 2004, and had an encore run at the Seoul Ani Cinema for three weeks beginning 17 February 2005. Its North American debut was at the Fantasia Festival in Montreal, Quebec, Canada on 15 July 2005, where it was shown in Korean with English subtitles. ADV Films released the movie to DVD in North America in 2007, with a choice of Japanese or English audio and optional English subtitles. The movie has also been locally released in Poland as Ostatni Stra≈ºnik Magii by Vision Film's Anime Gate imprint and in Russia as Povelitel' Prizrakov (, lit. Lord of the Ghosts) by MC Entertainment. The film was re-released on DVD by Funimation Entertainment on June 30, 2009 under the title Blade of the Phantom Master: Shin Angyo Onshi with the ADV movie trailer for the film as a special feature. The film features the English language track and the Japanese language track with English subtitles. The film is an adaptation of early comic chapters, covering the stories of Munsu's desert encounter with Mong Ryong, his subsequent quest to free Sando, and one of the pair's early adventures together. Webtoon On November 18, 2017, this work is rebooted and started serializing to Naver Webtoon three times a week. Because this comic is rebooted, it reconstructed the coloring and the cut arrangement newly in the webtoon style. It is collaborating with a company named YLAB on a webtoon project called Super String.

World War I  File:Be2d.jpg No.38 Squadron Royal Flying Corps was originally formed at Thetford in early 1916 and shortly after was re- designated as No.25 (Reserve) training squadron. A new No.38 Squadron was formed at Castle Bromwich in July 1916. It was designated as a Home Defence unit for the West Midlands and equipped with B.E.2c aircraft. In September 1916 the squadron was re-equipped with F.E.2b aircraft and the HQ moved to Melton Mowbray. Operations were undertaken from Stamford, Buckminster and Leadenham involving pilot instruction during the day and air defence against possible attacks from Zeppelins by night. For several months in 1916 the squadron was commanded by Captain A. T. Harris, later to become Air Chief Marshal Arthur Harris, C-in-C, RAF Bomber Command and Marshal of the Royal Air Force. In May 1918 the squadron with its F.E.2b aircraft was designated as a night bomber squadron and transferred to Dunkirk. In its first raid on 13 June 1918 ten of the squadron's aircraft targeted Ostend docks. Over five months of operations the squadron flew 1,591 hours' made 47 raids, dropping nearly 50 tons of bombs mainly on the German canals, railways, dumps and airfields in Belgium. After returning to England without its aircraft, 38 Squadron was disbanded at RAF Hawkinge on 4 July 1919. Reformation In September 1935 the squadron reformed at RAF Mildenhall as a night bomber squadron and was equipped with the Handley Page Heyford. It became one of the first RAF squadrons to re-equip with a monoplane bomber, the Fairey Hendon in November 1936. In 1937 the squadron moved to RAF Marham and in December 1938 received the first of the new Vickers Wellington bombers. It was declared operational on the outbreak of war as a bomber squadron under No. 3 Group. 38 Squadron was one of the few RAF squadrons to use the Wellington from the beginning to the end of the Second World War. File:Vickers-wellington-bomber-01.png File:vickers_wellington_VIII_torpedo.jpg File:WellingtonBomber.jpg  World War II =Home service The squadron had a quiet start to the war, flying sorties over the North Sea. It flew its first bombing mission on 3 December 1939, when three of its Wellingtons with aircraft from Nos. 115 and 149 Squadrons made a daylight raid against German warships in the Heligoland area. Although the operation had minimal effect on enemy shipping an enemy fighter was destroyed by rear gunner LAC J. Copley who was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal. The 11 May 1940 the squadron began operations in support of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). On 30 May 1940 seventeen Wellington Bombers from RAF Marham took off to provide close ground support to the BEF as they withdrew from the beaches of Dunkirk. Aircraft R 3162 from 38 Squadron was shot down near the town of Veurve in Belgium and the 6-man crew were killed. The co-pilot, Flying Officer Vivian Rosewarne was reported missing, believed killed on 31 May 1940. His station commander, Group Captain Claude H. Keith, found a letter among the missing airman's personal possessions. It had been left open, so that it could be passed by the censor. Group Captain Keith was so moved by the letter that, with the mother's permission, it was anonymously published in The Times on 18 June 1940.The Times, 18 June 1940. Times Publishing Company Ltd. It was subsequently published in a small book (An Airman's Letter to His Mother)An Airman's Letter to His Mother, (1940) Putnam & Co, London. and reprinted three times. By the end of the year over 500,000 copies had been sold. King George VI wrote personally to the mother. Suggestions that the letter was fictitious and propaganda eventually led to the identification of Flying Officer Rosewarne and his death notice was eventually published on 23 December 1940. In 1941 Michael Powell released a short documentary style British propaganda film of the letter featuring the voice of John Gielgud. From May 1940 onwards No.38 Squadron continued regular night raids on the Channel ports and the Ruhr and occasionally the squadron flew farther into Germany, reaching as far as Berlin later in the year. On one raid Squadron Leader Eric Foster, was shot down over the Black Forest on 14/15 June 1940. He escaped German captivity, including in the notorious Spangenberg Castle and Stalag Luft III, seven times, working on several escape tunnels. He was eventually repatriated to the UK by feigning insanity, an act which he felt ashamed about for the rest of his life. On return to the UK he was refused permission to resume flying duties, but went on to be adjutant of RAF Innsworth. Mediterranean theatre In November, No. 38 was withdrawn from operations and despatched to Fayid, Egypt to form a night bomber wing and engage in regular attacks on Italian ports along the North African coast in order to hamper the movement of supplies to the Italian forces in the Western Desert. Further raids took place the Greek islands and Yugoslavia after Germany invaded Greece In January 1942 the squadron became part of No. 201 group engaged in anti-shipping duties and carried out night torpedo attacks on enemy shipping in the Mediterranean from March to October 1942. The twin-engined Wellington bomber was still the mainstay of the Middle East night-bomber force. Although slow, unwieldy, and fabric-covered and too vulnerable a target by day, it possessed the necessary long range for night operations. Radar-equipped Wellingtons popularly known as ‚ÄòSnoopingtons‚Äô patrolled the shipping lanes throughout the night and using flares to illuminate enemy convoys and directing the strike-Wellingtons, or ‚ÄòTorpingtons‚Äô who attacked at sea level. The torpedo had to be released at approximately seventy feet above sea level, and on dark nights pilots sometimes flew into the sea. It was May 1942 when the first successful torpedo attacks were made on a convoy, resulting in two hits and one ship beached. Following the end of Axis resistance in North Africa the squadron focussed on attacking enemy ships and mining along the coasts of Italy and the Balkans. From January 1943 to December 1944, the squadron was engaged in mine laying, reconnaissance duties and anti-submarine patrols with detachments in Malta, along the Western Desert and in Palestine. No. 38 squadron was equipped with Wellington Mk VIIs with ASV radar (these aircraft became known as 'Goofingtons') and flew hunter-killer teams; the first success in this role occurred on 26 August, when a tanker was found, torpedoed and sunk. At the end of 1944, it moved to Greece in a support role for Air operations during the Greek Civil War and then on to southern Italy as part of No. 334 Wing. At first it was used to drop supplies to the Yugoslav Partisans, but in January 1945 the squadron converted to the Wellington XIV and returned to anti- shipping duties, attacking Axis shipping off the coast of northern Italy from then until the end of the war.  Post World War II  In July 1945 No. 38 moved to Malta and became operational with Vickers Warwick on 23 August for maritime reconnaissance and air sea rescue duties. No. 38 then converted to the Avro Lancaster in 1946 and moved to Palestine for eighteen months where they were involved in many long-range patrols over the Mediterranean in support of Royal Navy operations to suppress illegal Jewish immigration to Palestine before returning to Malta. Bill Brooks, founder of Christie's auction house was a pilot in 38 squadron and on 11 May 1947 he was the captain of one of four Lancasters which took 70 suspected Jewish terrorists from Palestine to Nairobi. He was told by his station commander that all log book entries should record \\"trooping\\" as the purpose of the trip; his secret orders stated: \\"Destroy after reading\\". The squadron continued with reconnaissance and air sea rescue duties, was re-equipped with the Avro Shackleton in 1954 and was based in Malta until 1967. During this time it sent detachments to participate in the Beira patrols during the period of Rhodesian UDI and to the Persian Gulf for an air blockade following the failure of negotiations with regard to the presence of a Saudi Arabian party at Hamasa. No.38 Squadron was disbanded at Hal Far, Malta on 31 March 1967. The numberplate emerged for the last time as the \\"shadow\\" identity of No. 236 Operational Conversion Unit RAF, the conversion unit for the Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft based at RAF St Mawgan in Cornwall. This lasted until the Options for Change review following the Cold War when 236 OCU was disbanded in September 1992 and the Nimrod training role transferred to No. 42 Squadron RAF.

On August 31, 2017, the channel was rebranded ESPNU Radio on Sirius XM, and began to simulcast some ESPNU television shows and ESPN college sports podcasts.ESPN, SiriusXM to partner on 24-hour college sports station, ESPNU Radio - Alex Putterman, Awful Announcing, 30 August 2017 XM Sports Nation history=Sporting News Radio (2001-2006) Before XMSN, channel 143 was a complete simulcast of Sporting News Radio, a United States based national sports radio network, of which XM had an exclusivity contract with. It was complemented on XM by its competitors, the long running ESPN Radio (channel 140), controlled by Hearst Corporation and Disney, and the recently formed Fox Sports Radio (channel 142), controlled by Premiere Radio Networks. The three sports networks remained in co-existence on the XM platform for several years. In 2005, the exclusivity contract with XM expired, and the satrad company renewed it under non-exclusivity, which allows XM competitor Sirius Satellite Radio to pick up the network as well. With the arrival of the PGA Tour Network, channel 143 ended up being pre-empted on the weekends due to bandwidth considerations. It was assumed that the channel was one of the platform's lower performers because of this, as no other third party sports networks on XM were being pre-empted. Despite negative feedback from fans, this practice did not stop until the channel underwent a renovation. XM Sports Nation (2006-2010) right On August 28, 2006, Sporting News Radio became XM Sports Nation, and featured several new shows exclusive to XM. XM had already used the XM Sports Nation name to brand their sportscasts, often ending the games with a soundbyte saying \\"This has been a presentation of XM Sports Nation\\". New programs included XMSN This Morning, Power Shift, Rotowire Fantasy Football Hour, and College Football Coast to Coast. XMSN also acted as a replay channel for select NASCAR Radio shows, and became the new home of XM Live's weekly show, 60/20 Sports. To accommodate these shows, the Sporting News Radio lineup was carved up selectively. Some shows survived the transition, while others were truncated, or bounced from the platform completely. As of the change to XM Sports Nation, weekends were no longer pre- empted for the PGA Tour Network, and the channel became available on XM Canada. XM143 to XM144, NASCAR Radio merger, and beyond On January 1, 2007, XMSN moved to XM 144 from XM 143. Programming from XM's NASCAR Radio channel was merged into XM Sports Nation, including Claire B. Lang's afternoon show, both Jimmie Johnson and Dale Earnhardt, Jr.'s live half-hour shows, and Joe Castello and Thommy Noodlez remained on Powershift from 8 to 10pm ET. XMSN also added the Andretti-Green Racing Hour in March 2007, as part of expanded Indy Racing League coverage. More content from Sporting News Radio was sacrificed to make these changes, which included more replays of XMSN originals. As of February 2007, the only weekday host from Sporting News Radio that continue to air on XMSN is Tony Bruno show. In addition, XMSN began airing Tony Kornheiser's radio show, which broadcasts from WTWP, on 2007-03-05. In August 2007, XMSN added Barry Switzer as a part of the channel's expanded college sports coverage. On 2008-01-21, XMSN added The Dan Patrick Show to its lineup as well as return Kornheiser to the lineup. Only one week into \\"The New XM Sports Nation,\\" Sporting News Radio announced that Tony Bruno was going to be cut from the network lineup.SNRAffiliates.com. Bruno departs Sporting News Radio Technically, Bruno's last show was on January 18, and was followed up by a week of fill-ins, but it wasn't announced that it would be his last broadcast.

He played from to , mostly with the New York Yankees and San Diego Padres. Early life Hitchcock was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina. He attended Armwood High School in Seffner, Florida. Professional career The Yankees selected Hitchcock in the ninth round of the 1989 Major League Baseball Draft. Though he committed to attend the University of South Florida, the Yankees signed Hitchcock with a $50,000 signing bonus. He made his Major League debut in 1992, pitching his first full season in 1994. He was traded to the Mariners after the 1995 season with Russ Davis for Tino Martinez, Jeff Nelson, and Jim Mecir. The following winter, the Mariners sent him to San Diego for Scott Sanders. Hitchcock is best remembered for his performance in the playoffs with the Padres, in which he was named the NLCS MVP. He was the winning pitcher in both of his starts with a 0.90 ERA in the NLCS. Overall in the 1998 playoffs he was 3-0, allowing 3 runs in 22 innings (1.23 ERA) with 32 strikeouts. His successful years with the Padres were followed by struggles with injuries. He underwent Tommy John surgery. The Padres traded Hitchcock back to the Yankees in mid-2001 for two minor leaguers. Hitchcock was the winning pitcher for the Yankees in Game 5 of the 2001 World Series. He re-signed with the Yankees after the season. The Yankees traded Hitchcock to the St. Louis Cardinals in 2003 for Justin Pope and Ben Julianel. He finished his career with the Padres in 2004. During the regular season, Hitchcock's career-best win-loss record was 13-9 with Seattle in 1996. His career-best ERA was 3.93 with the Padres in 1998.

The theorem formalizes the notion that theories at high energies have more degrees of freedom than theories at low energies and that information is lost as we flow from the former to the latter. Two-dimensional case Alexander Zamolodchikov proved in 1986 that two-dimensional quantum field theory always has such a C-function. Moreover, at fixed points of the RG flow, which correspond to conformal field theories, Zamolodchikov's C-function is equal to the central charge of the corresponding conformal field theory, which lends the name C to the theorem. Four-dimensional case: A-theorem John Cardy in 1988 considered the possibility to generalise C-theorem to higher- dimensional quantum field theory. He conjectured that in four spacetime dimensions, the quantity behaving monotonically under renormalization group flows, and thus playing the role analogous to the central charge in two dimensions, is a certain anomaly coefficient which came to be denoted as . For this reason, the analog of the C-theorem in four dimensions is called the A-theorem. In perturbation theory, that is for renormalization flows which do not deviate much from free theories, the A-theorem in four dimensions was proved by Hugh Osborn using the local renormalization group equation. However, the problem of finding a proof valid beyond perturbation theory remained open for many years. In 2011, Zohar Komargodski and Adam Schwimmer of the Weizmann Institute of Science proposed a nonperturbative proof for the A-theorem, which has gained acceptance. (Still, simultaneous monotonic and cyclic (limit cycle) or even chaotic RG flows are compatible with such flow functions when multivalued in the couplings, as evinced in specific systems.) RG flows of theories in 4 dimensions and the question of whether scale invariance implies conformal invariance, is a field of active research and not all questions are settled.

N√¶ƒ°ling is referenced many times as a fine weapon‚Äîit is \\"sharp\\", \\"gleaming\\", \\"bright\\", \\"mighty\\", \\"strong\\", and has a venerable history as an \\"excellent ancient sword\\", \\"ancient heirloom\\", and \\"old and grey- coloured\\".

Stopford Brooke claims this is \\"absurd, for Beowulf had fought with it all his life\\", and that \\"some later editor\\" inserted the passage, conflating Beowulf with a story told of Offa of Mercia. While Taylor Culbert argues the poet blames the weapon for it, effectively \\"aggrandiz[ing] Beowulf in the eyes of the reader\\", Judy Anne White, in a Jungian reading of the poem, proposes that \\"Beowulf's inability to use a sword is a part of his destiny, a question of fate, and therefore beyond his control.\\" The idea of a sword failing for the hero at a crucial time has parallels in other Germanic works such as in the Volsunga saga and Gesta Danorum. However this is especially true in the Gunnlaugs saga, where the author goes at pains to show that it was the hero and not the foe who broke the sword.Garb√°ty, Thomas Jay (1962). The Fallible Sword: Inception of a Motif. The Journal of American Folklore. American Folklore Society. p. 58-9 Furthermore, in Germanic tradition, exceptional swords may often use words such as old, ancient, or ancestral. However this may not always fit the story of the hero, such as when the sword is forged for him. In N√¶ƒ°ling's case, the sword has more of a literary characteristic than a specific ancestral lineage, as is evident from its name. Nevertheless, the sword is described as being gomol ond gr√¶gm√¶l (old and gray).Portnoy, Phyllis (February 1, 2006). The Remnant: Essays on a Theme in Old English Verse. Runetree. p. 25. .

It engages high-risk, low-income students ages 12‚Äì24 in a multi-year continuum of design- based programs to encourage academic achievement, college preparation, job readiness, and community service. Publicolor was founded by award-winning industrial designer Ruth Lande Shuman. It began as a pilot program for her master's degree in industrial design. She was affected by seeing so many public schools that looked more like institutions than facilities to foster creative thinking and learning. She saw schools that were in need of an environmental change. It's a fact that students learn better in beautiful surroundings, even more so when they are the ones creating that environment. Publicolor turns prison-like, hostile school environments into warm, welcoming student-centric environments. At the end of each project, students are left with a newly transformed building, a new sense of community and a much greater sense of safety. According to Shuman, ‚ÄúTeachers and students overwhelmingly report feeling safer in a Publicolored school. With minds no longer frozen by fear, teachers can teach and students can learn,‚Äù. Students are involved in the entire process, from choosing the colors to doing the painting. A vote is held for the most popular combinations. There's a school-wide vote so that everyone gets a say. ‚ÄúI saw environments that were so profoundly disrespectful, that looked and felt like prisons and that‚Äôs when the light bulb went on,‚Äù said Publicolor president and founder, Ruth Lande Shuman. ‚ÄúI thought, if I put a paintbrush in the hands of especially disaffected students, they would change the way their school looked and felt.‚Äù Publicolor runs afterschool mentoring programs three days a week for students, starting in the seventh grade through high school and college. Academic support, career guidance, and life-skills classes are offered through a design-based curriculum that aims to build character, self-esteem, work habits and goal- setting. The long-term tutoring and investment have resulted in a 95 percent high school graduation rate for Publicolor students, which is above the average of 65 percent for public school students from low-income areas. Since its conception, Publicolor has painted more than 450 schools and community facilities. The long-term, intensive curriculums offered, not only encourage community involvement, but also academic achievement, college prep, and job readiness. The 7-week Summer Design Studio at Pratt Institute aims to avoid summer learning loss by sharpening student's math and literacy skills through product design. Lande Shuman said she didn't set out to create a new model, ‚Äúbut what emerged was this applied learning model, which appeals to a lot of kids who are otherwise not attracted to traditional education.‚Äù In 2005, it was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Dole and Nyswander, in establishing methadone maintenance treatment (MMT), improved treatment options in addiction medicine which for a century had been based on the conventional view (circa 1965) that narcotic addiction was the result of an intractable moral defect. His work resulted in the partial re-legalization of opioid maintenance in the United States. For this contribution he was a recipient of the 1988 Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research. Heroin treatment Supreme court interpretations of the 1914 Harrison Narcotics Tax Act had criminalized opioid dependency as well as the use of any opioid \\"for the sole purpose of maintenance.\\" The criminalization and stigmatization of dependent individuals also influenced medical practice. Physicians and pharmacists, who risked being investigated by the Treasury Department officials that monitored their prescriptions, were wary of placing many patients on maintenance. Medical schools provided almost no instruction on addiction.‚ÄúThe Opium Problem and the Clinician's Dilemma,‚Äù Caroline Acker, Creating the American Junkie: Addiction Research in the Classic Era of Narcotic Control (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002), Kindle e-book. Dole's patients not only largely stopped heroin use, they expressed an interest in family, friends, work, and becoming fully engaged members of society once more. Though psychiatrists were available counseling was not mandatory. Dole found that the shift of priorities from daily drug-cravings and the endless quest to keep the abstinence syndrome at bay restored to these individuals an inherent sense of self-worth; they resumed family responsibilities as well as employment. The doctors noted that although methadone satisfied the physical cravings of heroin addiction, patients soon became completely tolerant to its effects. Patients would remain \\"dependent\\" on methadone but could otherwise live normally.

The IAF's 45 Sqn was tasked to carry out Close air Support missions in support of Indian troops. These 26 planes flying in Finger-four formation strafed Pakistani positions and attacked Pakistani tanks and ground targets, when these Indian aircraft were sighted, Pakistan Air Force (PAF) scrambled two F-86 Sabres, flown by S/L Sarfraz Rafiqui of No 5 Sqn and F/L Imtiaz Bhatti of No 15 Sqn from PAF Base Sargodha to intercept. In the ensuing dogfight over Chhamb where S/L Rafiqui took on flight leader and wingman and F/L Bhatti went after element leader and element wingman. India acknowledged losing four aeroplanes, all 4 IAF Vampires, flown by Squadron Leader Aspi Kekobad Bhagwagar (flight leader), Flight Lieutenant Vijay Madhav Joshi (element leader), Flight Lieutenant Satish Bharadwaj (element wingman) and Flight Lieutenant (later Group Captain) Shrikrishna Vishnu Phatak (wingman). Both PAF pilots were credited with shooting down two de Havilland Vampires each and were awarded with Sitara-e-Jurrat for this mission. On 6 September 1965, he was tasked to lead four aircraft of No 5 Sqn to strike IAF Halwara Air Base along with Flight Lieutenant Younus Hussain as his number 2, Flight Lieutenant Cecil Chaudhry as number 3, and Flight Lieutenant Saleem as No 4, reaching there by at 1705 hours. However, due to the missions flown earlier in defense of Lahore, the aircraft were made ready for flights at given time, critically delaying the raid. Later on. While taxiing, the generator of F/L Saleem malfunctioned and hence a 3 ship formation finally took off for Halwara. Halwara had two Hunter Squadrons (No 7 and No 27 Sqn, the former moving in from Ambala in August 65) stationed there. The formation pulled up for attack on target at 1753 hrs, immediately intercepting the CAP formation of Flying Officer A. R. Gandhi and Flying Officer P.S. Pingale of No 7 Squadron. After scoring one kill onto Pingale's Hunter, Rafiqui's guns jammed. He ordered Chaudhry to take lead carry on the attack and providing cover to his tail. While doing so, his plane was hit by Flying Officer A. R. Gandhi (who was shot down by Cecil, moments later). (As per IAF sources, Gandhi's claim was not vindicated being nowhere in the vicinity of the airfield, as maintained by Ghandhi, crediting Flt Lt D N Rathore of 27 Sqn). The wreckage of Rafiqui's Sabre #52-5248 is still held in IAF Museum at Palam. For his bold leadership displayed over Halwara, Rafiqui was awarded Hilal-i-Jur‚Äôat. His citation read: Honors and legacy Pakistan's third biggest air base, Rafiqui Airbase (Shorkot Cantonment) is named after him. One of the largest roads of the Lahore Cantonment is named Sarfaraz Rafiqui Road in his honour. Rafiqui Shaheed Road in Karachi is also named after him. In Peshawar, the Rear Air Headquarters and PAF School and Degree College, are located on Rafiqui Road. Parents' gesture The Government of Pakistan awarded 77 acres of prime agriculture land as a recompense with the awards of HJ and SJ, which was bequeathed by Rafiqui's parents to the Sarfraz Rafiqui Welfare Trust.

It is the fourth game in the Rampage series and a sequel to 1999's Rampage 2: Universal Tour. In the game, seven previous Scumlabs monsters and one new one use a time machine to rampage through time. Plot The world is yet again rebuilding after the events of Universal Tour. To speed up the cleaning process, the evil and corrupt Scumlabs creates a time machine to send employees back in time to deal with the destruction without having to do so in the present. Unfortunately, monsters from the previous games (George the ape, Lizzie the dinosaur, Ralph the wolfman, Boris the rhino, Curtis the rat and Ruby the lobster), have somehow returned to Earth, this time joined by a new monster: Harley the warthog. They surprise Scumlabs and enter the time machine, and begin terrorizing the past, present, and future, bringing mayhem to the space-time continuum. Later, a UFO-like craft is created to stop the monsters, only to fail. Eventually, the monsters are finally defeated. Gameplay In Campaign Mode, each time zone consists of four stages. The first three consist of traditional Rampage gameplay, in that the player must destroy all the buildings in each city while avoiding attacks from enemy forces. Campaign Mode is only playable with one player, but the CPU will randomly select two other monsters to oppose the player in that time zone. After each city is destroyed, all three monsters are awarded stars for inflicting the most damage on buildings, people, and each other. The fourth stage is a multiplayer minigame that varies with each time zone, usually as a parody of games such as Asteroids or Breakout. In Campaign Mode, the player must win these minigames in order to continue with the main game. The stars earned in the Rampage stages are also translated into extra points for the minigames, making it important to earn as many as possible to increase the chances of winning. Reception The game received \\"unfavorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings.

The ensemble is Texas A&M;'s first mixed choir, and is the university's second oldest choral group. The Century Singers perform regularly throughout the Bryan/College Station community and annually throughout the State of Texas. The choir is currently under direction of Mr. Travis Angel, and is accompanied by Mr. Miguel Sousa. History The group was formed in 1970, soon after the previously all male university began accepting undergraduate female students. Bob Jarvis, a freshman engineering student at the time, proposed the group to Bob (Robert L.) Boone, then director of the famed all male Singing Cadets, the university's only other choral group at the time. Bob Boone agreed to direct a mixed choir if Bob Jarvis would pull it together. With the help of another entering freshman, Lee Edmundson, Bob Jarvis blanketed the campus with ads for the first meeting of a new choral group dubbed \\"The New Tradition Singers.\\" That first meeting, held 19 February 1970, in the Singing Cadet room (119 of G. Rollie White Colosseum) was attended by a fairly even mix of about 60 male and female students interested in singing choral music. Bob Boone was ready with music, and the singing commenced immediately. Bob Jarvis was soon elected to be the new organization's first president, and Bob Boone became its first director. The organization was taken under the Memorial Student Center official student organization umbrella the following school year with approximately 60 members and the \\"New Tradition Singer\\" name. Its first public appearance was for the Thanksgiving service in All Faiths Chapel on campus on 23 November 1970, singing a Wallace Hornibrook arrangement for combined choirs of \\"We Gather Together.\\" In the late 1970s Bob Boone, affectionately known throughout the growing A&M; vocal music program as \\"Coach,\\" turned over direction of the group to Patricia Fleitas, and the group changed its name in 1976 to \\"The Century Singers\\" in commemoration of Texas A&M; University's Centennial. In the mid-1980s its direction was taken over by Jess Wade III until 2013 when Eric Posada was hired. In the summer of 2016, Dr. Posada left his position as director, and Travis Angel, a longtime high school choir director, became the interim director for the 2016-17 school year, accepting a full time position in the fall of 2017. Music The Century Singers historically sing a wide variety of choral literature. Their repertoire includes Christian hymns and gospel music, as well as traditional and contemporary choral works. Musical selections vary in their origins, spanning across continents and centuries. The choir has collaborated with the Brazos Valley Symphony Orchestra in performances of several major works including Carl Orff's Carmina Burana, Brahm's Ein Deutsches Requiem, and Gjeilo's Sunrise Mass. Organization The Century Singers hold auditions twice each school year at the beginning of each semester and throughout the summer months. Membership is open to any Texas A&M; student both undergraduate and graduate. The choir is one of three within Texas A&M.; The Century Singers rehearse in Texas A&M;'s Memorial Student Center along with the all-female Women's Chorus and the all-male Singing Cadets. The group is represented by a seven-member Executive Officer Board who meet weekly with the director to make plans and decisions for future Century Singers activities. In addition to their duties as a choral performance group, the Century Singers also function socially as one of Texas A&M;'s recognized student organizations. Members have the opportunity to participate in a wide variety of social events including overnight retreats and weekly activities such as ice skating, movie and game nights, and group dinners.

It was intended to be the last of four vessels forming the Oceanic class, before two new ships were commissioned. After a rough maiden voyage from Liverpool to New York City on 1 February 1872, the ship was chosen to be on White Star Line's first voyage on the South Atlantic and Pacific line with four other ships, destined for Chile. In 1874, the construction of modern ships SS Germanic and SS Britannic led to SS Republics becoming the standby vessel of White Star Line. It occupied this position for 15 years, and attempts were made to modernise it in 1888. When SS Teutonic and SS Majestic entered service in the following year, the Republic became surplus to White Star's needs. Republic was sold in 1889 to Holland America Line and was renamed Maasdam, and served with the company for twelve years. In 1902, it was sold to Italian company La Veloce where it was renamed Vittoria, before being renamed again to Citt√† di Napoli. It was used for many years to transport Italian migrants to America. It was retired in 1908, and was lent to the Italian government to house victims of the 1908 Messina earthquake. The ship was scrapped in 1910 in Genoa. During its service it could carry a varying number of passengers; under White Star Line it could carry 166 first class and over 1,000 steerage passengers; under Holland America Line it could carry 150 first class, 60 second class, and 800 steerage passengers' and as a migrant ship it could carry 1,424 steerage passengers. The facilities on the ship were described as a \\"floating palace\\" when it was owned by White Star Line, and were similar to RMS Oceanic, but were slightly modernised. History=White Star Line When Thomas Henry Ismay established White Star Line in 1867, he came to an agreement with Gustav Christian Schwabe in return for financial assistance. Ismay promised to build the company's future ships in Harland and Wolff's shipyards in Belfast, which had been founded by Schwabe's nephew Gustav Wilhelm Wolff. Four ships were originally commissioned to form the Oceanic class, but this was later expanded to six. Republic was the fourth ship of the class and was launched on 4 July 1871; its name notes the date it was launched was Independence Day in the United States. The ship's maiden voyage took place on 1 February 1872, from Liverpool to New York City, stopping at Queenstown. This trip damaged the ship; a rainstorm flooded the engine room and boiler room, and a lifeboat was damaged, seriously injuring a sailor. This incident led White Star Line to reconsider their routes, and they found that ships with the most freedom of movement rarely suffered damage. At the end of 1872, all six Oceanic class ships were in service, but White Star Line only required five. Ismay attempted to compete with the Pacific Steam Navigation Company on the line of the South Atlantic and the Pacific, destined for Chile. Republic was chosen to serve this route with two smaller mixed- liners, SS Asiatic and SS Tropic, and two other ships, SS Gaelic and SS Belgic. Faced with this offensive, the Pacific Steam Navigation Company attempted to construct a vessel capable of competing with Republic, the Tacora. Both ships participated in a race between Liverpool and Callao in October 1871; the Tacora was unable to travel beyond Montevideo, but Republic successfully completed the journey. Despite the success of the trip, Republic was placed back on the route to New York, while the South Atlantic and Pacific routes were cancelled, as they were too expensive. Reserve vessel SS Britannic, one of the modern ships that led to SS Republic becoming unnecessary to White Star Line. In 1874, White Star Line had two modern ships produced, the SS Britannic and the SS Germanic. The Republic was deemed unnecessary for the regular service to New York and became a standby vessel for the company. Despite this, the SS Republic was used repeatedly in the future, whenever one of the modern vessels had to undergo repairs or maintenance. In February 1879, the ship was badly damaged after being struck on the River Mersey by schooner Ocean Queen. In December of the same year, the Republic faced rough seas during a crossing of the Atlantic, and its smokestack was damaged and had to be repaired by the crew. In December 1880, Republic was damaged and was meant to be towed by German steam vessel Mosel. This vessel did not have enough coal, but Republic managed to reach New York a few days later without assistance. In 1885, White Star Line briefly provided Inman Line with SS Baltic, as they were having financial difficulties. The Republic temporarily served as the replacement for this ship. On 20 September 1885, the Republic collided with the Cunard Line steamer Aurania while leaving the port of New York, following the error of a coast pilot. Republic was sufficiently damaged for the journey to be cancelled, and the ship was put into dry dock. In 1888, the Republic underwent a redesign, and a second class was added. In January 1889, the ship began its final voyage with White Star Line under the command of Edward Smith, who later became the captain of the RMS Titanic. On 27 January, the ship was grounded a few hours before its arrival in New York; an incident near the boilers killed three trimmers and seriously injured several others. Despite this, the ship underwent repairs and made its last voyage to England. Flagging and retirement The arrival of Teutonic in 1889 and the announcement of SS Majestic made the Republic unnecessary, and it was put up for sale. It was purchased in June 1889 by the Holland America Line, which paid ¬£35,000 to acquire it. Renamed Maasdam, it was immediately sent to G. Forrester & Co. in Liverpool for an overhaul of machinery (for more economical and effective machines) and a reorganisation of its facilities. Once this overhaul was completed, the Maasdam was able to carry 150 first class passengers, 60 second class passengers, and 800 steerage/third class passengers. From 15 March 1890, it served on a route between Rotterdam and New York, and was not damaged during its service with the Holland America Line, which satisfied the company. In 1902, a brief stopover at Boulogne-sur-Mer was added to the route to New York. In 1902, it was sold to Italian company La Veloce, which first renamed it Vittoria, before quickly switching it to Citt√† di Napoli. The ship transported migrants from Genoa, Naples, Palermo, and Gibraltar to New York, and underwent an overhaul which increased its capacity to 1,424 steerage passengers. Its first voyage with the company began on 30 September 1902. Citt√† di Napoli was used until 27 April 1907, when it was withdrawn by the company. After the 1908 Messina earthquake, La Veloce lent Citt√† di Napoli, North America, and Savoia to the Italian government, in order to shelter the victims. La Veloce re-obtained the ship in 1909, and it was scrapped in Genoa the following year. With a lifetime of 38 years, the ship was the last of the Oceanic class to be scrapped. Features Republic shared many characteristics with those of the first liner in the Oceanic series, Oceanic, constructed in 1870. Republic measured and had a gross register tonnage of 3708. It could be powered by sail, with four masts, but also had smokestacks painted the colours of White Star Line, brown and black. Its machines came from G. Forrester & Co. of Liverpool and were two reciprocating engines (able to accommodate two cylinders), similar to those of the RMS Atlantic. Although it could theoretically reach speeds of 14.5 knots, it never managed to reach that speed. When the ship was renamed to Maasdam, its propulsion system was redesigned and was equipped with alternative machines, and could support three cylinders. Republic, like Oceanic, was initially able to carry 1,000 steerage passengers and 166 in first class. The facilities on the Oceanic revolutionized nautical travel, earning it the nickname of \\"imperial yacht\\", as it had facilities for wealthy passengers and was more stable than other ships. The first class passengers had bathtubs, a dining room, and chairs rather than benches. There is no precise information regarding the facilities of the Republic, but it is thought that it was similar to Oceanic, but had been improved. A passenger in 1874 described Republic as a \\"floating palace, with the style and comfort of a Swiss hotel\\", and said their room was welcoming and gold, and the ship contained a piano, library, smoking room, and barber. When the ship became the Maasdam, the liner was able to accommodate 150 first class, 60 second class, and 800 steerage passengers. Finally, when it was designed to transport migrants, it could accommodate 1,424 steerage passengers.

It was originally installed at nearby Chessington World of Adventures in 1999, being transferred to Thorpe Park in 2003. The song played on the ride is a modified version of \\"Burly Brawl\\", from the soundtrack of The Matrix Reloaded.

On-Ride Photo: No G-Force: +4g / -3g Status: Operating Capacity: 30 seats per ride, 400 riders per hour Samurai at Chessington Samurai is a Top Scan ride from the Dutch company Mondial. The ride was originally installed at Chessington World Of Adventures in 1999 as part of the Mystic East section of the park, and replaced the original plan of installing a Huss Flic Flac on the site. The ride was the first of its kind in a UK amusement park, though a travelling version, \\"Top Buzz\\" debuted on the UK fair circuit the previous year. Samurai stayed at Chessington until the end of the 2003 season when it was closed, dismantled and moved to Thorpe Park. Reasons for the ride's move are largely speculative. Most enthusiasts generally regard the decision to be part of Tussaud's (the company which owned Thorpe Park and Chessington at the time) plans to change the target audience of both parks. Chessington was intended to become a more family orientated park and installations since the 2002 season have been in line with this policy. Similarly Thorpe Park has moved towards attracting the 14-30 market and has installed thrill rides since this policy emerged. Keen-eyed guests can still spot a reminder of Samurai at Chessington when they ride the Dragon Falls log flume - a theming item depicting a samurai warrior gripping the head of his decapitated foe, emerging disconcertingly from the undergrowth. Samurai at Thorpe Park Samurai opened at Thorpe Park as the sole new ride for the 2004 season. It sits in the site that had been occupied by the Calgary Stampede ride. Some confusion emerged with regards to the location of this ride in relation to Thorpe Park's themed \\"lands\\". Calgary Stampede was a Canada Creek ride yet Samurai was painted and themed to match the Lost City rides, similar to Vortex. This decision sparked discussion of a \\"three areas\\" system for Thorpe Park where the existing themed areas would be condensed into three larger themed areas, which would probably be the Lost City, Amity Cove and Calypso Quay areas of the park. Subsequent installations in Canada Creek seem to have dispelled this rumour.(As of 2016, Samurai has been listed as a ride in the Old Town area) Samurai's arrival at Thorpe Park met with mixed reactions. The move had been long discussed on fan sites but few saw it as more than a fantasy. When the move was announced, many fans were disappointed to see Chessington lose one of its best (if not the best) rides. There was further controversy when it emerged that Samurai was to retain its name at Thorpe Park, despite not fitting the style and theme of the area. There have also been suggestions that since its move to Thorpe Park it has been run on less intense settings and the use of manual control has been all but abandoned, to the disappointment of enthusiasts. Although during Fright Nights, the settings on Samurai were raised on some occasions, comparisons to other Top Scan rides around Europe, particularly on the travelling fair circuit, show that even at Chessington the ride was already running well below its maximum speed and intensity. There were rumours that the Samurai was to be integrated into the Canada Creek area and re- themedhttp://www.projectdylan.co.uk/page/Info for the opening of the new SAW: The Ride roller coaster opening in 2009, however this did not occur. Instead, the blue fences around the ride (seen in the above photo) were painted red to fit in better with the roller coaster. As well as this, the ride received a queue extension so that it could cope with the increased number of visitors in the area of the park.

It was best known for toys marketed and sold in the late 1950s and early 1960s, like the 'Johnny Reb Cannon', 'Mighty Matilda Atomic Aircraft Carrier', 'Remco Voice Control Kennedy Airport' (which featured model airplanes of American, TWA and United Airlines, an album player and an album which played a voice giving landing and take-off instructions) and the tethered 'Electronic Falcon Plane' that \\"flies itself\\". The company's slogan was \\"Every Boy Wants a Remco Toy...And So Do Girls!\\"\\"You Can Tell It‚Äôs Mattel‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs Swell!\\", Tim Forbes, American Heritage History Remco was founded by two cousins, Isaac \\"Ike\\" Heller and Saul Robbins. Armand Daddis soon joined the two as the company gradually moved from simple 'walkie-talkies' to a variety of sophisticated remote control toys. The name Remco comes from the two words \\"Remote Control\\". Originally located in Newark, NJ, the company later moved to nearby Harrison, New Jersey. The boxes and toys were printed with just the company name and the city on them, but there were a few more clues as to the company's physical location on packaging. A street address listed on the back of the 1960 light bulldog tank box is \\"113 North 13th Street, Newark 7, NJ.\\" The address on the instruction sheet for factory service return of the 1966 Lost in Space Robot is \\"Cape May St., Harrison, NJ.\\" The Harrison location is now occupied by the Red Bull Arena, while the Newark location is now occupied by a furniture outlet. In the mid-1960s, Remco acquired several licenses for popular culture groups and TV shows and proceeded to make a variety of toys. Some of these were the Beatles, the Monkees, Lost In Space, The Munsters, Batman and Star Trek. However, the company often paid little heed to faithfulness to the property: Star Trek for instance, the merchandise Remco released for that series was usually generic toys from previous unrelated lines and had decals of the series simply placed on them, which is a technique called \\"label slapping.\\" One popular toy in the early 1960s was the 24 inch long functioning scuba diver with mask, knife, utility belt, rifle, walkie-talkie, air tanks, and floating location buoy. From the 1980s through the 1990s, Remco made a variety of generic diecast and plastic trucks and other vehicles, usually uniformly made about four inches long. Vehicles were attractive and sturdy, though not uniform in scale, and included a tanker truck, fire truck, delivery van, cherry picker truck, skid steer, Jeep, and many more. A few vehicles were larger, like the seven inch long \\"Tuff Ones\\" \\"Recyclable Waste Management Corp.\\" truck with opening side doors for \\"cans\\", \\"glass\\", and \\"paper\\". Bankruptcy Remco filed for bankruptcy in 1971 and was acquired by Azrak-Hamway International, Inc. (AHI), a toy company, in New York City in 1974. The company was known by toy collectors for their many Universal Monsters figures produced during the 1980s. These figures were a continuation of the license and figures first produced by AHI during the 1970s. Steel Tec was distributed by Remco Toys, Inc. of New York, New York, from 1992-1997 and was a division of parent company Azrak Hamway International.

It was established on September 4, 2000, by decree of President Alberto Fujimori. The reserve protects several ecosystems of the tropical rainforest for the preservation of such forest and the sustainable use of forest resources by the peoples around the reserve.  Geography  Tambopata National Reserve is located south of the Madre de Dios river, in the province of Tambopata, region of Madre de Dios. It reaches the border with Bolivia to the east and borders with Bahuaja Sonene National Park to the south. The area consists of forested hills and plains, with elevations ranging from 200 to 400 m above sea level. The area presents swamps, oxbow lakes and meandering rivers; the main rivers in the reserve being the Tambopata, Malinowski and Heath rivers.  Climate  The annual mean temperature in the area is 26 ¬∞C, with a range between 10¬∞ and 38 ¬∞C. The lower temperatures are caused by cold winds of antarctic origin; these cold waves occur in June and July. The rainy season occurs between December and March. Ecology left Tambopata National Reserve protects an area of rainforest, which belongs to the moist and wet subtropical forest according to the Holdridge life zone classification. The reserve is of ecological importance as it is part of the Vilcabamba Amboro wildlife corridor, which extends into neighboring Bolivia.  Flora  Vascular plants are represented in the reserve by 1713 species in 145 families. Among the species found in this protected area are: Virola surinamensis, Cedrela odorata, Oncidium spp., Bertholletia excelsa, Geonoma deversa, Minquartia guianensis, Epidendrum coronatum, Iriartea deltoidea, Celtis schippii, Spondias mombin, Mauritia flexuosa, Cedrelinga cateniformis, Hymenaea courbaril, Ficus trigonata, Croton draconoides, Inga spp., Attalea tessmannii, Calycophyllum spruceanum, Swietenia macrophylla, Dipteryx charapilla, Couroupita guianensis, Socratea exorrhiza, Hura crepitans, Manilkara bidentata, Clarisia racemosa, Hevea guianensis, Guadua weberbaueri, Ceiba pentandra, etc. Fauna Among the mammal species found in the reserve are: the jaguar, the puma, the ocelot, the collared peccary, the giant otter, the Peruvian spider monkey, the jaguarundi, Hoffmann's two-toed sloth, the capybara, the tufted capuchin, the white-lipped peccary, the marsh deer, the red brocket, the brown-throated sloth, the black-capped squirrel monkey, the South American tapir, etc. Some of the species of fish present in the reserve are: Prochilodus nigricans, Potamorhina latior, Brachyplatystoma flavicans, Piaractus brachypomus, Brycon spp., Schizodon fasciatus, etc. Some species of birds present in the reserve are: the harpy eagle, the white-necked jacobin, the scarlet macaw, the rufescent tiger heron, the king vulture, the roseate spoonbill, the crested eagle, the razor-billed curassow, the blue-and-yellow macaw, the variegated tinamou, the sunbittern, the red-and-green macaw, the horned curassow, the golden-tailed sapphire, etc. = Silkhenge mystery = In 2013, Georgia Tech researcher Troy Alexander discovered four bizarre gazebo-shaped spider nests while visiting the Reserve. The nests, which have since come to be known as Silkhenge structures, were each composed of an undocumented silk compound and consisted of a circular fence-like formation encompassing a spire at its center. Alexander's subsequent Reddit inquiry was unable to identify the peculiar nest structure pictured or the species of arthropod associated with it. Later that year, an expedition to the Reserve led by Phil Torres observed 45 additional like structures.WE WENT TO THE AMAZON TO FIND OUT WHAT MAKES THESE WEIRD WEB-TOWER THINGS While the team successfully documented several spiderlings hatching from the nests (video of which was later posted online), none of them survived into adulthood. Furthermore, the team was unable to observe any member of the species to exhibit the characteristics indicative of adult arthropods. With DNA testing proving inconclusive, the species native to Silkhenge structures remains unidentified.Mysterious 'Silkhenge spider' is a master architect  Anthropology  The Ese Ejja and Huachipaeri native peoples inhabit the buffer zone surrounding the reserve.  Recreation  The main recreational activities in the reserve are wildlife observation and camping, as there are several spots furnished for those purposes. Lake Sandoval, 30 minutes from Puerto Maldonado, is the most visited place in the reserve, its shores covered with palm trees which are home to macaws, can be toured by boat. Two other lakes can be reached after 2 and 3 hour trips, respectively. There are also many mineral licks where birds and mammals gather and are popular nature watching spots.  Access  The reserve can be reached by boat from the town of Puerto Maldonado.  Environmental issues  Illegal gold mining is the main threat to the environment in the reserve. This activity has destroyed more than 450 hectares of forest inside the area. References External links  *Tambopata National Reserve.

At Athirappilly Falls, the water surges around big rocks and cascades down in three separate plumes. Below the falls, the river remains turbulent for about until it reaches Kannamkuzhi. Then it calms and flows smoothly until reaching the dam at Thumburmuzhi. Wildlife Forest wildlife in the area includes the Asiatic elephant, tiger, leopard, bison, sambar, and lion-tailed macaque. The unique elevation riparian forest in the Athirappilly-Vazhachal area is the only location where all four South Indian species of hornbills ‚Äî the great hornbill (the state bird of Kerala), Malabar pied hornbill, Malabar grey hornbill, and the Indian grey hornbill are found living together. If the proposed 163-MW Athirappilly hydroelectric project is built, these unique birds may vanish from these forests because it will submerge the hornbills' habitat. Plantations in the area contain teak, bamboo, and eucalyptus. Environmentalists claim that Athirappilly is a one-of its-kind riparian ecosystem in Kerala. V.S. Vijayan, Chairman of the Kerala State Biodiversity Board and former Director of the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History (SACON), Coimbatore, has been quoted in Down to Earth magazine as affirming that the Vazhachal forest division is the second most biodiverse area in the State. The International Bird Association has declared it an ‚ÄòImportant Bird Area' and the Asian Nature Conservation Foundation has recommended that the area should be declared a sanctuary or a national park, he points out. The Wildlife Trust of India says it represents one of India's best elephant conservation efforts. \\"Any disruption to this fragile ecosystem will spell disaster,\\" says Vijayan.

The station made a name for itself with its coverage of an explosion at the Linden, New Jersey Bayway Refinery just after 11 PM Saturday December 5, 1970, which had area residents fearing for their lives much of the next day. In January 1971, the station changed its call letters to WJDM, with the letters J, D and M standing for the first names of the original owners (see infobox above for detailed information on this topic). Later the station adopted an ethnic format, reflecting the city's changing demographics, expanding from Sundays to full-time in the 1990s. On December 8, 1995, the station became first in the United States to acquire a license to operate in the AM expanded band on 1660 kHz, carrying the Radio AAHS network children's format until 1997.

The game had an interesting development cycle, with IGN revealing the title on November 23, 2005. At the time independent developer oeFun had started work without having a publisher lined up. oeFun and O~3 came into a publishing agreement in the summer of 2006 after the title was finished. Multicoloured pairs of tiles have to be placed on a grid that is lined with 'conductors' by using the DS's stylus, with the aim of creating rows or blocks of the same colour. Once a row of tiles reaches the edge of the board, the pieces can be removed by drawing with the stylus through a conductor and along the chain. The game is also Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection enabled. A sequel titled Konductra: Graveyard Shift was released for download on the Apple iOS on July 18, 2013.  Gameplay  Players destroy lines by matching tiles and using the stylus to trace from like coloured conductors running along the four edges of the screen. The bottom touch screen is where the game is played. The top screen shows integral information about the game being played. The built-in tutorial, with speech, offers an overview of game basics. There is a timer that counts down as the piece is being positioned, and if the tile is not placed on the grid by the time the countdown reaches zero, the piece is automatically put on the board as a \\"block\\" tile. These \\"blocks\\" can only be removed by being conducted in a chain twice, as opposed to just once for a normal token. Modes include: * Score: Using the top screen as a reference for potential points, players aim to get a high score. When a line is destroyed, players are awarded the points shown on the top screen, while getting multiple lines multiplies the score shown. At levels 5 and 10, new coloured tokens are introduced. * Task: Match the shape shown on the top screen. Once the shape has been successfully duplicated, it must be destroyed to win. There are 66 tasks that can be unlocked, but they must be completed in order. The mode is used to introduce techniques for more complex methods of play. * VS Human: Play against another human using the Nintendo DS wireless feature. The object is to beat your opponent by keeping your board clear while simultaneously filling up your opponent's board. In this mode, destroying lines directly results in damage to the opponent's board. Each damaged token flips, making it unplayable, until opponents tap it with the stylus. Multiple lines destroyed results in a greater number of flipped tiles. More powerful attacks occur when completely horizontal or vertical lines are drawn from one edge to the opposite edge of the grid. These attacks result in \\"blocks\\" being thrown on your opponent's board, which must be destroyed (i.e. included in a chain) twice to be completely removed. The game is over when one board is completely filled with tiles or \\"blocks\\". * VS Computer: Play a normal battle against the computer and unlock up to five successively more difficult CPU skill levels.  Online play  When playing on the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, the Nintendo DS nickname, rank and score of each player are tracked. The leaderboards on Konductra.com can be used to compare individual ranks and scores with players from around the world. Anyone that quits is awarded an automatic loss, to prevent the behaviour often encountered during Mario Kart DS online play, where competitors would exit the game when they realised they were going to lose so as not to affect their rank. Only Worldwide games played on the Nintendo WFC modify the player's ranking - Local/Friend matches do not. When a Nintendo WFC Worldwide match is played, the player's current rank and highest score from the single player Score mode is posted on the online leaderboards. Reception Konductra received average reviews, scoring 60% on Metacritic and 63% on GameRankings. Many critics criticized the bare-bones presentation, but praised the gameplay, some calling it \\"original\\" and \\"solid\\".

The primary mission of CSU-ERFSA is the protection of pension and health care benefits for both active and retired California State University faculty and staff members. CSU-ERFSA represents the interests of its members before the California State Legislature, various state and federal agencies, CalPERS, and the California State University Chancellor's Office. CSU-ERFSA also provides assistance to members, who may be experiencing difficulties with their individual pension or health care benefits. History The association was formed in 1985 as the California State University Emeritus and Retired Faculty Association (CSU-ERFA) in response to threats and attempts to reduce or eliminate CSU retirees rights, privileges and benefits and to support the activities of retired faculty as continuing members of the academic community. In 2018 members of CSU-ERFA voted to amend the organization's constitution to expand membership eligibility to all retirees from the California State University System, and to change the name of the organization to reflect the expanded membership eligibility. Currently, CSU-ERFSA has approximately 2,500 members, 300 of whom live outside California. In addition to its efforts to protect retiree benefits, the association provides support to emeritus and retired faculty and staff associations at the individual state university campuses. At present retired faculty associations at 18 of the 23 campuses maintain a formal affiliation with CSU-ERFSA. However, membership in an affiliate is not a condition for membership in the statewide organization. In 1989 CSU-ERFSA (then CSU-ERFA) successfully convinced the CSU Board of Trustees to adopt the resolution (RFSR 06-89-03) which established that \\"the .... emeritus faculty shall be deemed to be continuing members of the academic community\\" and shall have privileges \\"on the same basis as they are enjoyed by the general faculty.\\" In conjunction with other California public employee organizations, CSU-ERFSA helped to secure the passage of Proposition 162, The California Pension Protection Act of 1992, that provides protection against the use of pension funds for general budget purposes. CSU-ERFSA was instrumental in working with the Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) to establish the CalPERS Long-Term Care Insurance Program. Several features of the program including its flexibility, consumer protection standards, and the California Partnership option were influenced by CSU-ERFSA. CSU-ERFSA successfully supported federal and state legislation that eliminated the source tax for retirees who live in a different state than that which provides their pension income. Because of these laws, the pension income of CSU retirees who live outside California is subject only to the state income tax of their state of residence. Activities The large majority of CSU-ERFSA members receive retirement and health care benefits from the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS). A small number of older retirees receive their retirement benefits from the California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS). CSU-ERFSA provides assistance to its members who experience problems with their pension and health-care benefits. CSU-ERFSA makes available retirement planning advice for active California State University faculty members. In addition, CSU-ERFSA operates a grants program that supports the research, scholarly, and creative activities of its members. Funding for this program is provided from the CSU-ERFA Charitable Foundation, which is a separate organization that holds U.S. Internal Revenue System 501(c)3 status. CSU-ERFSA maintains liaison with the CSU Academic Senate, the California Faculty Association (CFA), the California State Employees Association (CSEA), the California State Coalition of Retired Employees (SCORE), and the Retired Public Employees Association of California (RPEA). CSU-ERFSA publishes a quarterly newsletter, The Reporter, for its members, which also is available to the public through the CSU-ERFSA website.

The most recent revision reduced the number of species in the genus to seven (Styles, 1981). The common cedro, Cedrela odorata L., embraces 28 other synonyms, including C. mexicana M. J. Roem. The taxon \\"C. angustifolia,\\" a very vigorous type now in demand because of its apparent resistance to the shootborer, was left in an indeterminate status due to insufficient herbarium material. The result is that C. odorata as now constituted is a species showing a high degree of population variation. Distribution and habitat Close-up of the trunk Cedro is a tree of the New World tropics, appearing in forests of moist and seasonally dry subtropical or tropical life zones (24) from latitude 26¬∞N on the Pacific coast of Mexico, throughout Central America and the Caribbean, to the lowlands and foothills of most of South America up to altitude, finding its southern limit at about latitude 28¬∞S in Argentina. It has become a troublesome invasive species in the Galapagos Islands.http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/SA/Ecuador/Galapagos/ScalesiaSantaCruz.htm Cedro is always found naturally on well-drained soils, often but not exclusively on limestone; it tolerates a long dry season but does not flourish in areas of rainfall greater than about or on sites with heavy or waterlogged soils. Individual trees are generally scattered in mixed semi-evergreen or semi-deciduous forests dominated by other species. Mahogany, a close relative, is often found with cedro and both suffer damage from the same pest, the mahogany shootborer (Hypsipyla grandella). Description The tree is monoecious semi-deciduous ranging in height from . The trunk has a thick grey‚Äìbrown bark, with longitudinal irregular grain. Pinnately compound leaves, grouped towards the end of the branches, long, with pairs of scythe-shaped leaflets, lanceolate to oblong, √ó with the base obliquely truncated and asymmetric. Uses Cedrela odorata is the most commercially important and widely distributed species in the genus Cedrela. Known as Spanish cedar in English commerce, the aromatic wood is in high demand in the American tropics because it is naturally termite- and rot-resistant. An attractive, moderately lightweight wood (specific gravity 0.4), its primary use is in household articles used to store clothing. Cedro heartwood contains an aromatic and insect-repelling resin that is the source of its popular name, Spanish-cedar (it resembles the aroma of the unrelated true cedars (Cedrus spp.) Cedro works easily and makes excellent plywood and veneer and would be more widely used if it could be successfully plantation grown. This plant is often used for honey production (beekeeping) and humidor construction. It is occasionally used for tops or veneers on some kinds of electric guitars. The wood is the traditional choice for making the neck of flamenco and classical guitars.Romanillos, J.L.

Found in southeastern Honduras to western Ecuador * R. a. ambiguus - Swainson, 1823: Found in southwestern Colombia to south-central Peru * R. a. abbreviatus - Cabanis, 1862: Originally described as a separate species. Found in northeastern Colombia and northern Venezuela Description Ramphastos ambiguus at the Bronx Zoo This species has a total length of 47‚Äì61 cm (19‚Äì24 in) and weighs from . Among all toucans and living members of the order Piciformes, only the toco toucan and the white-throated toucan average larger than the similarly-sized black-mandibled and chestnut-mandibled races. Among standard measurements, the short wing chord is , the huge bill is , the tail is , and the tarsus is .Toucans, Barbets and Honeyguides (Bird Families of the World) by Lester Short & Jennifer Horne. Oxford University Press (2001), . Its plumage is mainly black. Upper breast and throat are bright yellow, with a thin red border on the throat, a creamy rump and a scarlet anal area. The bill is bicolor and massive, a little shorter in the female. It is lemon-yellowish on the upper side and blackish on the rest of the maxilla and on the mandible, often brown close to the base. The skin of the face around the eyes is pale green or yellow-green.Oiseaux.net Distribution and habitat The yellow- throated toucan ranges along the eastern slope of the Andes from Peru, north through Ecuador and Colombia, to Venezuela as far as the coastal ranges. This species is adapted to a wide variety of habitats, from plains to tropical and subtropical forest. It lives at altitudes of 100‚Äì2400 m. in humid montane forest, with a preference for the canopy and edge. Behaviour and ecology The call of the yellow-throated toucan is a yelping, far-carrying cry described as ‚ÄúD√≠os te d√©‚Äù (Spanish for \\"God give you...\\"). This species feeds mainly on fruits, but occasionally on lizards, rodents, smaller birds and insects. The breeding season lasts from March to June. The nests are usually located in a cavity in rotting wood at 10‚Äì25 meters above the ground. The females lay 2-4 white eggs incubating for about two weeks.

Generally, a man can reach orgasm within a few minutes of active thrusting during sexual intercourse, whereas a man with delayed ejaculation either does not have orgasms at all or cannot have an orgasm until after prolonged intercourse which might last for 30‚Äì45 minutes or more. In most cases, delayed ejaculation presents the condition in which the man can climax and ejaculate only during masturbation, but not during sexual intercourse. It is the least common of the male sexual dysfunctions, and can result as a side effect of some medications. In one survey, 8% of men reported being unable to achieve orgasm over a two-month period or longer in the previous year.Strassberg, D. S., & Perelman, M. A. (2009). Sexual dysfunctions. In P. H. Blaney & T. Millon (Eds.), Oxford textbook of psychopathology (2nd ed.), (pp. 399‚Äì430). NY: Oxford University Press. Signs and symptoms Delayed ejaculation can be mild (men who still experience orgasm during intercourse, but only under certain conditions), moderate (cannot ejaculate during intercourse, but can during fellatio or manual stimulation), severe (can ejaculate only when alone), or most severe (cannot ejaculate at all). All forms may result in a sense of sexual frustration.Hatzimouratidis, Konstantinos, et al. \\"Guidelines on male sexual dysfunction: erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation.\\" European urology 57.5 (2010): 804-814.. Causes Medical conditions that can cause delayed ejaculation include hypogonadism, thyroid disorders, pituitary disorders such as Cushing's disease, prostate surgery outcome, and drug and alcohol use. Difficulty in achieving orgasm can also result from pelvic surgery that involved trauma to pelvic nerves responsible for orgasm. Some men report a lack of sensation in the nerves of the glans penis, which may or may not be related to external factors, including a history of circumcision.Dias J, Freitas R, Amorim R, Espiridi√£o P, Xambre L, Ferraz L, Adult circumcision and male sexual health: a retrospective analysis, Andrologia, 20 April 2013 Delayed ejaculation is a possible side effect of certain medications, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), opiates such as morphine, methadone, or oxycodone, many benzodiazepines such as Valium, certain antipsychotics, and antihypertensives.drugs.com > Delayed ejaculation Review Date: 6/5/2007. Reviewed By: Marc Greenstein, DO, Urologist, North Jersey Center for Urologic Care Psychological and lifestyle factors have been discussed as potential contributors, including insufficient sleep, distraction due to worry, distraction from the environment, anxiety about pleasing their partner and anxiety about relationship problems. One proposed cause of delayed ejaculation is adaptation to a certain masturbatory technique. Lawrence Sank (1998) wrote about the \\"Traumatic masturbatory syndrome\\", when the sensations a man feels when masturbating may bear little resemblance to the sensations he experiences during intercourse. Factors such as pressure, angle and grip during masturbation can make for an experience so different from sex with a partner that the ability to ejaculate is reduced or eliminated. Treatment=Sex therapy Therapy usually involves homework assignments and exercises intended to help a man get used to having orgasms through insertional intercourse, vaginal, anal, or oral, that is through the way to which he is not accustomed. Commonly, the couple is advised to go through three stages. At the first stage, a man masturbates in the presence of his partner. Sometimes, this is not an easy matter as a man may be used to having orgasms alone. After a man learns to ejaculate in the presence of his partner, the man's hand is replaced with the hand of his partner. In the final stage, the receptive partner inserts the insertive partner's penis into the partner's vagina, anus, or mouth as soon as the ejaculation is felt to be imminent. Thus, a man gradually learns to ejaculate inside the desired orifice by an incremental process. Other Meditation has demonstrated effectiveness in case studies. There is yet no reliable medication for delayed ejaculation. PDE5 inhibitors such as Viagra have little effect.The Carlat Psychiatry Report > PDE-5 Inhibitors: Which to Choose? Published in The Carlat Psychiatry Report. December 2004, Volume 2, Number 12 In fact, Viagra has a delaying effect on ejaculation, possibly through additional effect in the brain or decrease of sensitivity in the head of the penis.WebMD Health News > Viagra, Paxil Help Premature Ejaculation.

The terms of all seven Representatives to the United States House of Representatives will expire on January 3, 2007, and will be put up for contest. The winning candidates will serve a two-year term from January 3, 2007 to January 3, 2009. If necessary, a runoff round will be held on December 9, 2006. Louisiana uses a unique voting system to determine its representation in the U.S. Congress. Elections in Louisiana‚Äîwith the exception of U.S. presidential elections‚Äîfollow a variation of the open primary system called the jungle primary. Candidates of any and all parties are listed on one ballot; voters need not limit themselves to the candidates of one party. Unless one candidate takes more than 50% of the vote in the first round, a run-off election is then held between the top two candidates, who may in fact be members of the same party. This means that the outcome of some races might not be known until over a month later than the rest of the country. The Louisiana races, especially those in the southern portion of the state, were impacted to some extent as a result of Hurricane Katrina, as well as Hurricane Rita, both of which have caused massive damage within Louisiana. For example, most of New Orleans' majority African-American communities were displaced by Katrina. All Louisiana Congressmen won re-election and avoided a run-off except Democrat William Jefferson of New Orleans, under investigation for corruption. He won a run-off against fellow Democrat Karen Carter. As of 2016, this is the last election in which Democrats won more than one congressional district in Louisiana.

District 1 thumb Incumbent Republican Congressman Bobby Jindal, first elected in 2004, faced no serious challenge from Democratic challengers David Gereighty, an electrical engineer, and Stacey Tallitsch, a computer engineer, or from Libertarian opponent Peter Beary. This highly conservative district is based around Lake Pontchartrain and the suburbs of New Orleans and Jindal was re-elected with nearly ninety percent of the vote. District 2 thumb This staunchly liberal district, based mainly within the city of New Orleans, has elected Bill Jefferson to Congress consecutively since 1990. Seeking his ninth term in Congress, Jefferson was largely unpopular due to the fact that he was under federal investigation for corruption charges at the time, and therefore, a great many candidates emerged to challenge him. On the Democratic side, State Representative Karen Carter, State Senator Derrick Sheperd, New Orleans City Councilman Troy Carter, Orleans Parish School Board attorney Regina Bartholomew, John Edwards, Scott Barron, former congressional candidate Vinny Mendoza, and D.C. Collins ran. Republicans Joe Lavigne, an attorney; Eric Bradley; Lance von Uhde and Libertarian Rhumbline Kahn also ran, creating a very crowded race. On October 14, the Louisiana State Democratic party voted to endorse Karen Carter. In the first line of balloting, no candidate received a majority of the votes, so the top two candidates, Jefferson and Carter, advanced to a second line of balloting, which Jefferson ultimately won by a comfortable margin, despite the corruption charges against him. District 3 thumb Incumbent Democratic Congressman Charlie Melan√ßon won his first term 2004 by defeating Billy Tauzin III, the son of the retiring Congressman by only 569 votes, leading many to conclude that he was vulnerable to a Republican challenger. State Senator Craig Romero emerged as Melan√ßon's chief competitor, though Democrat O.J. Breech and Libertarian James Blake also ran, but ultimately fell to Melan√ßon by a surprisingly comfortable margin in this solidly conservative district based in the southern suburbs of New Orleans and south-central Louisiana. District 4 thumb This district, based in northwestern Louisiana and greater Shreveport, is staunchly conservative and has consistently re-elected incumbent Republican Congressman Jim McCrery with solid margins since his initial election in 1988. This year proved to be no different, and Congressman McCrery walloped Democrats Artis Cash and Patti Cox and Republican Chester Kelley with over fifty-seven percent of the vote. District 5 thumb Incumbent Republican Congressman Rodney Alexander was initially elected to this conservative, northeast Louisiana district in 2002 as a Democrat, but switched to the Republican Party in 2004 and was re-elected for the first time as a Republican. In 2006, he was re-elected in a landslide over Democrat Gloria Hearn, Libertarian Brent Sanders, and independent John Watts. District 6 thumb This conservative district is based around the Baton Rouge metropolitan area and was represented by Republican Congressman Richard Baker. Baker sought his eleventh term in Congress and faced no Democratic challenger, but did square off against Libertarian candidate Richard Fontanesi, a contest that he won in an overwhelming landslide. District 7 thumb Incumbent Republican Congressman Charles Boustany sought a second term in this conservative district based in the Cajun, southwest portion of the state. Boustany's initial election in 2004, to replace previous Congressman Chris John was relatively close and attracted national attention. In 2006, he faced Democratic nominee Mike Stagg, and the contest proved to be relatively uneventful, with Boustany winning a second term with over seventy percent of the vote.

Located on the east bank of the Fraser River, Soda Creek was originally the home of the Xat'sull First Nation. Soda Creek Indian Reserve No. 1 is located on the left (E) bank of the Fraser River, one mile south of the Soda Creek BCR (CN) station, 431.10 ha. Xat'sull means \\"on the cliff where the bubbling water comes out\\". European settlement began in the 1860s with the onset of the Cariboo Gold Rush and the building of the Old Cariboo Road. History Enterprise at Soda Creek (1868) The Old Cariboo Road was built from Lillooet to Alexandria, beginning in 1859 and completed to Soda Creek in 1863. The roadbuilder for that section was Gustavus Blin Wright. While Wright was overseeing the construction of the road he was also arranging with his associates for the building of a sternwheeler steamer that could take travelers to Quesnellemouthe, (later shortened to Quesnel) where they could then travel east to Barkerville. The Fraser River was not considered navigable by sternwheeler north of Yale due to many hazardous rapids and canyons. However, from Soda Creek to Quesnel, the Fraser was relatively free of obstructions, therefore Soda Creek was the logical terminus for sternwheelers on the upper Fraser River. The Enterprise was launched in the spring of 1863 and most of the travelers on their way to the goldfields, by foot, horseback, or wagon, took the Enterprise as the wagon road would not be not completed to Quesnel until 1865. Colonial Hotel (1868) With the launching of the Enterprise the government placed a land reserve on Soda Creek. Almost at once land lots were sold. Robert McLeese, Joseph T.Senay, Robert A. Collins, Peter Dunlevy, Henry Yeates, and George Hendricks, were some, who built hotels, stores, blacksmith shops and saloons on the site. In 1869 Wright added a second sternwheeler to the route, the Victoria. Both sternwheelers worked on the route until 1871, when the Enterprise was taken up north to Takla Landing to deliver supplies and miners to the Omineca Gold Rush. Main Street (1890s)The Enterprise didn't return and the Victoria worked alone for the next 15 years until she was taken off the river in 1886. By then the gold rushes were over and Soda Creek slumbered until the construction of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. The second boom Soda Creek (1914) Following the initial stampede to the Cariboo Gold Rush in the early 1860s, Soda Creek enjoyed a second boom which started in 1909, when it was announced that the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway's route would go through Fort George from eastern Canada. Again the town's prosperity was due to being the natural sternwheeler terminus on the Fraser River as sternwheelers were necessary to take settlers and supplies safely and comfortably upriver to Fort George. The Fort George Lumber and Navigation Company of South Fort George built two sternwheelers at Soda Creek, both in the winter of 1909/10, the Chilcotin and the Fort Fraser which were used along with the Chilco, Charlotte and Quesnel to deliver passengers and supplies to the new communities in Fort George. BX under construction (1910) The BC Express Company had been servicing the area since the Cariboo Gold Rush and they held the government mail contract, so the company's owner, Charles Vance Millar, decided to expand the company's route to Fort George by adding sternwheelers and automobiles to their fleet of stagecoaches. The BC Express Company built a company office and construction site at Soda Creek and in the winter of 1909/10 they built the BX and then the BC Express in the winter of 1911/12. BX Office at Soda Creek (1911) The automobiles were Winton Sixes, purchased in 1910 from a car manufacturer in Seattle. During the years of rail construction, Soda Creek prospered as a major stopping place on the Cariboo Road as travelers and supplies came up from Ashcroft on stagecoaches or in automobiles and were transferred onto the sternwheelers to go further north.

The group was formed in 1904. This performing ensemble includes students from many different academic majors at the university. Membership is open to any student on the Macomb campus regardless of major and does not require an audition except for leadership positions like section leader, drum major, senior assistant, equipment manager, etc.  Performance Information  Their performances have included halftime shows for the Kansas City Chiefs, St. Louis Rams, Indianapolis Colts, and Chicago Bears of the National Football League, as well as exhibition performances at the Bands of America Regional Championships at the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis, Missouri and at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis, Indiana. Western Illinois University also hosts the Marching Band Classic, a high school marching band competition that attracts bands from Illinois, Iowa and Missouri. The Marching Leathernecks also perform for Leatherneck football games, both home and away, parades, exhibitions, and regional tours. The full schedule may be viewed on the bands WIU band's website.  Traditions  The band has a rich history and many traditions. The tradition of \\"Georgia On My Mind\\" has been in practice since 1982. At the end of every show the band plays its traditional closer, \\"Georgia on My Mind\\". This piece features a trumpet soloist and an interesting presentation of the band. For this tune the brass is packed against the fence, right next to the crowd. Halfway through, the brass turns as one to face the crowd while playing as loudly as possible. After each performance, the band forms an inner facing circle to perform \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" from Carousel. This piece, which is performed for the group themselves instead of its audience, is used strengthen the commitment of the members to one another as individuals and helps to bond the group as a caring, compassionate family, both on and off the field. This has only been officially recorded once in the history of the group. That recording was made during a tribute to Dale Hopper who passed suddenly in the Fall of 2005. Instrumentation The Marching Leathernecks consist of four major components: wind instruments, percussion, color guard, and danceline. The wind instrumentation consists of both woodwind and brass instruments. Woodwind: *Piccolo *Flute *Clarinet *Alto and Tenor Saxophone Brass: *Trumpet *Mellophone *Trombone *Baritone (Marching) *Sousaphone The Percussion instrumentation consists of a drumline.

Submitted designs and drawings of the vehicle went under the names OKH Auftrag Nr. 30404 and E-30404/1, which were presented in December 1942. The tank was planned to be 1000 tonnes, being far heavier than the Panzer VIII \\"Maus\\", the heaviest tank ever built (weighing 188 tonnes). The project gained the approval of Adolf Hitler, who had expressed interest in the development of the tank, but was cancelled by Minister of Armaments Albert Speer in early 1943.  Development  The development history of the Ratte originated with a 1941 strategic study of Soviet heavy tanks conducted by Krupp, the study also giving birth to the Panzer VIII Maus super-heavy tank. The study led to a suggestion from Krupp's director (Grotte), a special officer for submarine construction, who, on 23 June 1942, proposed to Adolf Hitler a 1,000-tonne self-propelled gun which he named \\"Landkreuzer\\" (\\"Land Cruiser\\"). It consisted of a fully tracked chassis carrying one of the surplus main gun turrets left over from the planned refitting of the Scharnhorst-class battleships. To protect this immense economic investment, the hull of the vehicle was to carry armour up to thick, and several anti-aircraft guns were to be installed on the vehicle's engine deck to fend off Allied ground-attack aircraft. Hitler became enamoured with Grotte's concept and ordered Krupp to begin development of it in 1942. As of December 29, 1942 a few preliminary drawings had been completed, by which time the concept had been named \\"Ratte\\" (\\"Rat\\") by Hitler himself. These submitted designs went under the titles OKH Auftrag Nr. 30404 and E-30404/1. Albert Speer saw no reasonable use of the tank and canceled the project in 1943 before any prototype could be manufactured, although this did lead to the concept of the Landkreuzer P. 1500 Monster self-propelled siege gun, which would have been heavier than the Ratte. The general idea for such a big tank was best summed up by Heinz Guderian, saying that: \\"Hitler's fantasies sometimes shift into the gigantic\\". Not all historians are convinced that the P.1000 even got as far as an outline design. Although it is generally accepted that Hitler asked for a feasibility study into a 1000-ton tank in 1942, there is much doubt around the specifics of the plan to use the guns or spare turrets from the battleship . The turrets alone weighed approximately 750 tons and required a five-storey structure to house the associated handling rooms and rotating machinery. Such weapons would also require separate magazines and shell rooms as well as handling machinery for the ammunition, all of which required space and power well beyond the scope of what would be possible in a 1000-ton tracked vehicle. Accordingly, some historians believe the P.1000 Ratte diagram to be either a hoax, or alternatively a speculative engineer's sketch made for personal amusement.  Description  The Rattes proposed size was enormous: it would have weighed 1,000 tonnes, five times the weight of the Panzer VIII Maus. The divided weight of the Ratte included 300 tonnes of armament (the total weight of the guns themselves was 100 tonnes, so turret armour would have weighed 200 tonnes), 200 tonnes of armour and frame, and 100 tonnes of track and automotive components, while remaining weight would have been distributed to miscellaneous features. It was planned to be long ( when including naval guns), high, and wide. This immense weight was to be distributed across the ground by six wide and long treads, together forming two composite treads with a width of each. This would help stability and weight distribution, but the vehicle's sheer mass would have destroyed roads and rendered bridge crossings next to impossible. It was expected that its height, and its ground clearance of , would have allowed it to ford most rivers with relative ease, thus eliminating the need for bridge crossings. Planned propulsion was by two MAN V12Z32/44 24-cylinder marine diesel engines of each (as used in U-boats) or eight Daimler-Benz MB 501 20-cylinder marine diesel engines of each (as used in E-boats) to achieve the needed to move the tank. The engines were to be provided with snorkels, also like those used by German submarines. The snorkels were designed to provide a way for oxygen to reach the engine, even during amphibious operations while passing through deep water. The Ratte‚Ä≤s primary weapon would have been a dual 28 cm SK C/34 naval gun turret. This was the same turret that was used on the German battleship but modified by removing one of its three guns and its associated loading mechanism. Removing the third gun allowed extra accommodation of ammunition, and reduced the total weight of the tank by 50 tonnes. The guns used for the Ratte would have fired ammunition developed for other naval guns. It also included armour-piercing rounds with of explosive filler, and high-explosive rounds with of explosive filler. Illustration of the proposed Landkreuzer P. 1000 Ratte (left) in comparison to other German tanks ‚Äî the proposed Panzer VIII Maus (center) and the Tiger I (right). A human figure is at far left. Further armament was to consist of a 128 mm anti-tank gun of the type used in the Jagdtiger or Maus, two 15 mm Mauser MG 151/15 autocannons, and eight 20 mm Flak 38 anti-aircraft guns, probably with at least four of them as a Flakvierling quad mount. The 128 mm anti-tank gun's precise location on the Ratte is a point of contention among historians, most believing that it would have been mounted within the primary turret, with some others thinking a smaller secondary turret at the rear of the Ratte more logical. Some concept drawings exist to suggest a flexible mount on the glacis plate. The tank was to be provided with a vehicle bay that could hold two BMW R12 motorcycles for scouting, and several smaller storage rooms, a compact infirmary area, and a self-contained lavatory system.  Issues  The large size and weight would have rendered the tank unable to cross bridges at the risk of collapsing them, and travelling on roads would soon destroy them. Though its top intended speed was , its huge size and high visibility would have made it extremely vulnerable to aerial bombardment and artillery fire. Its great size would also have meant that once built the vehicle's strategic, operational, and tactical mobility would be entirely dependent on its own drivetrain, for there were no other realistic means of moving it from one firing position to another. No existing railway or train car could bear its weight and its width was too great for existing tunnels.

Flying qualities involves the study and evaluation of the stability and control characteristics of an aircraft. They have a critical bearing on the safety of flight and on the ease of controlling an airplane in steady flight and in maneuvers. Relation to stability To understand the discipline of flying qualities, the concept of stability should be understood. Stability can be defined only when the vehicle is in trim; that is, there are no unbalanced forces or moments acting on the vehicle to cause it to deviate from steady flight. If this condition exists, and if the vehicle is disturbed, stability refers to the tendency of the vehicle to return to the trimmed condition. If the vehicle initially tends to return to a trimmed condition, it is said to be statically stable. If it continues to approach the trimmed condition without overshooting, the motion is called a subsidence. If the motion causes the vehicle to overshoot the trimmed condition, it may oscillate back and forth. If this oscillation damps out, the motion is called a damped oscillation and the vehicle is said to be dynamically stable. On the other hand, if the motion increases in amplitude, the vehicle is said to be dynamically unstable. The theory of stability of airplanes was worked out by G. H. Bryan in England in 1904. This theory is essentially equivalent to the theory taught to aeronautical students today and was a remarkable intellectual achievement considering that at the time Bryan developed the theory, he had not even heard of the Wright brothers' first flight. Because of the complication of the theory and the tedious computations required in its use, it was rarely applied by airplane designers. Obviously, to fly successfully, pilotless airplanes had to be dynamically stable. The airplane flown by the Wright brothers, and most airplanes flown thereafter, were not stable, but by trial and error, designers developed a few planes that had satisfactory flying qualities. Many other airplanes, however, had poor flying qualities, which sometimes resulted in crashes. Handling qualities are those characteristics of a flight vehicle that govern the ease and precision with which a pilot is able to perform a flying task.Cooper, G.E. and Harper, R.P., ‚ÄúThe Use of Pilot Rating in the Evaluation of Aircraft Handling Qualities,‚Äù NASA TN D-5153, April 1969 This includes the human-machine interface. The way in which particular vehicle factors affect flying qualities has been studied in aircraft for decades, Gilruth, R.R., ‚ÄúRequirements for Satisfactory Flying Qualities of Airplanes,‚Äù NACA TR 755, 1943 and reference standards for the flying qualities of both fixed-wing aircraft ‚ÄúMilitary Standard, Flying Qualities of Piloted Airplanes,‚Äù MIL- STD-1797, March 1987. and rotary-wing aircraftAeronautical Design Standard, Performance Specification: Handling Qualities Requirements for Military Rotorcraft,‚Äù ADS-33, May 1996 have been developed and are now in common use. These standards define a subset of the dynamics and control design space that provides good handling qualities for a given vehicle type and flying task. Historical development Bryan showed that the stability characteristics of airplanes could be separated into longitudinal and lateral groups with the corresponding motions called modes of motion. These modes of motion were either aperiodic, which means that the airplane steadily approaches or diverges from a trimmed condition, or oscillatory, which means that the airplane oscillates about the trim condition. The longitudinal modes of a statically stable airplane following a disturbance were shown to consist of a long-period oscillation called the phugoid oscillation, usually with a period in seconds about one-quarter of the airspeed in miles per hour and a short- period oscillation with a period of only a few seconds. The lateral motion had three modes of motion: an aperiodic mode called the spiral mode that could be a divergence or subsidence, a heavily damped aperiodic mode called the roll subsidence, and a short-period oscillation, usually poorly damped, called the Dutch roll mode. Some early airplane designers attempted to make airplanes that were dynamically stable, but it was found that the requirements for stability conflicted with those for satisfactory flying qualities. Meanwhile, no information was available to guide the designer as to just what characteristics should be incorporated to provide satisfactory flying qualities. By the 1930s, there was a general feeling that airplanes should be dynamically stable, but some aeronautical engineers were starting to recognize the conflict between the requirements for stability and flying qualities. To resolve this question, Edward Warner, who was working as a consultant to the Douglas Aircraft Company on the design of the DC-4, a large four-engine transport airplane, made the first effort in the United States to write a set of requirements for satisfactory flying qualities. Dr. Warner, a member of the main committee of the NACA, also requested that a flight study be made to determine the flying qualities of an airplane along the lines of the suggested requirements. This study was conducted by Hartley A. Soul√© of Langley. Entitled Preliminary Investigation of the Flying Qualities of Airplanes, Soul√©'s report showed several areas in which the suggested requirements needed revision and showed the need for more research on other types of airplanes. As a result, a program was started by Robert R. Gilruth with Melvin N. Gough as the chief test pilot. Evaluation of flying qualities The technique for the study of flying qualities requirements used by Gilruth was first to install instruments to record relevant quantities such as control positions and forces, airplane angular velocities, linear accelerations, airspeed, and altitude. Then a program of specified flight conditions and maneuvers was flown by an experienced test pilot. After the flight, data were transcribed from the records and the results were correlated with pilot opinion. This approach would be considered routine today, but it was a notable original contribution by Gilruth that took advantage of the flight recording instruments already available at Langley and the variety of airplanes available for tests under comparable conditions. An important quantity in flying qualities measurements in turns or pull-ups is the variation of control force on the control stick or wheel with the value of acceleration normal to the flight direction expressed in g units. This quantity is usually called the force per g. Relation to Spacecraft A new generation of spacecraft now under development by NASA to replace the Space Shuttle and return astronauts to the Moon will have a manual control capability for several mission tasks, and the ease and precision with which pilots can execute these tasks will have an important effect on performance, mission risk and training costs. No reference standards currently exist for flying qualities of piloted spacecraft.

The original 19th-century mill became notorious during the Industrial Revolution for its unsavoury employment practices, luridly described by the commentators of the day, and the testimony of Robert Blincoe, a parish apprentice who had been indentured to work at the mill. It was set up in 1782 by Ellis Needham and Thomas Frith, both farmers with small estates in the area. The mill was powered by the water of the River Wye, using Richard Arkwright's water frame. It could be said that the company was doomed from the start. Needham, in particular, had sunk most of his assets into the venture. The valley was particularly isolated and transport for the raw material and finished goods was poor. Moreover, they had difficulty in attracting a workforce. The early spinners, such as Arkwright and Strutt, had been able to attract the families of weavers and framework knitters, so-called \\"free labour\\" meaning the employees were not indentured. Meanwhile, Evans at Darley Abbey could draw on a pool of labour from the town of Derby. In contrast, the area around Litton was sparsely populated by farming people who were scornful of the new cotton industry. By 1786 the, barely profitable, mill was put up for sale. There were no buyers and Needham and Frith struggled on. Needham's money had gone and he was farming on rented land, while Frith left the partnership in 1799. The Poor Law Act of 1601 had, among its provisions \\"the putting out of children to be apprentices\\". An agreement was made between the churchwarden and an employer, by means of an indenture sworn before a Justice of the Peace, that the latter would provide for and give employment and training to a pauper child. Often this worked for the benefit of the child but often it was seen by employers as a source of cheap labour and a way for a parish to relieve itself of responsibility. In the absence of any local labour, this was the course taken by Needham and Frith. In the early 19th century there was a general depression in the industry, and the workforce was reduced by a half. There was a serious fire, and in 1811 the waterwheel broke and was out of action for a month. By 1815, Needham was bankrupt and had been given notice to quit. By 1828 he was a pauper. Frith fared somewhat better on his farm, and operating a small spinning mill near Tideswell. The mill was operated for a time by the Newtons of Cressbrook Mill but was destroyed by another fire in 1874. Very little remains of the original mill. Its replacement manufactures nylon yarn for hosiery. In 1893 Mr Matthew Dickie, a former Stockport mill owner, bought Litton Mill. Dickie began his business career as a spinner and manufacturer with his father Matthew Dickie Senior. When he took over Litton Mill he brought with him several families from Stockport. He set up a Litton & Cressbrook Mills Company and Cressbrook Mill was taken over. To bring the two mills into closer touch, a road was made along the river by the Company and a toll in aid of local hospitals was charged for visitors who wished to use the road. This shortened the distance to Monsal Dale. Litton Mill was sold to a syndicate in 1934. Matthew Dickie had Ravenstor built in Miller's Dale as his family residence which was given to the National Trust in 1937 by Alderman J.G.Graves of Sheffield along with of land, which included a one-mile (1.6 km) stretch of the River Wye and Tideswell Dale, all of which are leased to the Youth Hostel Association and open all year round.

They are notable for a number of rock paintings. The best known of them is the cave named Abrigo del Diablo (\\"Devil's rock face\\").  Geography  Situated in the western Andes, they are in the Moquegua Region of the Osmore River. Located at an elevation of ( is also mentioned in another source), they are two small caves each in size, with a depth of . The two Toquepala Caves in the high Sierra are located near the Quebrada Cimarron or along the Rio Locumba, which is a dry stream flowing from the Sierra to the desert. The best known of the caves is \\"Abrigo del Diablo\\".  History  The caves were seasonally occupied. The art attained its peak when the Collawa ethnic group lived here during the Paleolithic or Stone Age period. Archaeological research in the region revolved around the Asana site, as well as the Middle Horizon (500-1000AD) and the lower valley pre-Hispanic sites. Important archaic caves discovered in the Osmore River Basin were the Toquepala Caves. This cave became famous after copper was found in the valley and South Peru Copper Corporation started exploration of the Cuajone mines. The cave was studied in 1963 at the initiative of South Peru Copper Corporation. They found a large cache of artifacts during their mining operations and funded the study of the paintings in the caves by archeologists from Lima.) The team was led by Jorge C. Muelle, Director of the Museo Nacional de Arqueolog√≠a, Antropolog√≠a e Historia del Per√∫ which resulted in the discovery of the rupestral art (drawings inscribed on rocks in the caves). The detailed exploration of the caves was undertaken by Roger Ravines of the Museo Nacional de Arqueolog√≠a, Antropolog√≠a e Historia del Per√∫ in 1965. Excavations from a pit dug to a depth of was subject to radio carbon testing. The investigations revealed pre-ceramic habitation of the caves dated to 7,650 BC (10,000 BC is also mentioned). In one pit, remnants of paints along with brush wood were found at the same depth. He published his findings in 1965. During the investigations, a fence was erected around the caves to prevent intruders from vandalizing the rock paintings. In spite of this measure there were incidents of surreptitious entry to the caves in which some of the rock paintings were damaged. Since then stronger security fencing has been arranged.  Features  The caves have rock art of gatherer-hunters who are inferred to have lived in the caves about 10,000 years ago. There are more than 50 rock paintings drawn by the inhabitants of the caves of the Palaeolithic age of which 30 were studied. These scenes depict armed men hunting the guanaco cameloid and Andean religious symbols. The figures drawn are of animals, predominantly guanacos (cameloids). The scene depicted is of hunting by the humans who are corralling and killing a group of guanacos. The humans are in a posture of attacking the animals with axe, lances, and spear throwers. However, bow and arrow are not part of these scenes of rock art. They are painted in seven colours. Red was the dominant colour; yellow and green are also mentioned. The paint was made from hematite.

The farce was adapted from a play written for the award- winning BBC Radio God's Country series and premiered in 1999 in Edinburgh. It was also performed at the Edinburgh Festival in 2000, where it was highly acclaimed. Shortly afterwards it transferred to the Whitehall Theatre in London's West End in a production starring the comedian Frank Skinner, Sharon Percy, Charlie Hardwick and Joe Caffrey. According to Richard Paul Knowles, one of the most popular shows in Edinburgh in 1999 was \\"Lee Hall's anarchic Cooking with Elvis, performed beneath one or three crystal chandeliers which hung next to a disco ball at one end of the Ballroom, a lush old gilded space in some decay at the heart of the Assembly Rooms. The show was by turns camp, comic horrific, and in-your-face, a tragic farce about child abuse, wife abuse, sex, loss and cooking.\\"Richard Paul Knowles, Reading the Material Theatre (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p.192. The comedy centres on Dad (Joe Caffrey), a famous impersonator of rock 'n' roll star Elvis Presley, who was paralyzed in a car crash and is now forced to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair. Other characters include his anorexic, alcoholic wife Mam (Charlie Hardwick), their fourteen-year-old daughter Jill (Sharon Percy), and their young lover Stuart (Frank Skinner). Climaxes of the play are surreal fantasy scenes in which Dad's hallucinatory Elvis dreams are bursting into popular Presley songs as a reminiscence of his one-time persona of an Elvis impersonator. At one time, Dad, already dressed in his Elvis costume, leaps from his wheelchair and launches into an Elvis ballad. At other times a wardrobe door will be opened for Elvis to leap out and into another song with Mam and Jill as backup singers. In another scene, Singing Elvis becomes Reverend Elvis who starts making bizarre speeches about philosophy, drugs and sodomites - references to Presley's consumption of drugs and, according to reviewer Rich See, the gay rumors that continue to swirl around Presley, namely, his \\"obsession with James Dean and his alleged affair with actor Nick Adams.\\" The glittering costumes in the play remind the viewer of the costumes worn by the Las Vegas Elvis in the 1970s. For example, there are ornate belts with gold padlocks and many spangles. Mam has an insatiable appetite for sex which can no longer be satisfied by her husband. Jill is primarily interested in cookery books. Mam is locked in a battle with her daughter, who disapproves of the fact that her mother has a very indiscreet sexual liaison with Stuart, a handsome young baker, in the marital home. Mam's sexual need is echoed in Jill‚Äôs appetite for food which leads to her being overweight. Brought home by Mam, Stuart soon figures in everyone's sex life, including the brain-damaged \\"Elvis\\" who seems to have at least one part of his anatomy functioning.

The navy blue flag contains a large central emblem consisting of the city seal with 13 \\"electric flashes\\" (depicted as lightning bolts) and interspaced 5-pointed white stars emanating from it. History Former flag, 1912-1924 Following a request from New York City publisher, the Julius Bien Company, to provide a copy of the banner graphic for a work depicting the flags of large municipalities, Mayor L.P. Fuhrmann and Commissioner of Public Works, Francis G. Ward, proposed a design. The city's first flag was composed of the city seal superimposed on the state coat-of-arms in blue over a buff- colored background.  1912 proposal  From Common Council Proceedings, June 3, 1912: > To the left center a lighthouse on pier with ship passing it into harbor. To > the lower right canal boat passing into canal to the right surrounded in > circle by the legend \\"City of Buffalo, Incorporated 1832.\\" The > municipalities of the United States having as a rule a Municipal Flag, > examinination shows the general practice to be the use of the Coat of Arms > of the City or the Coat of Arms of the State upon which is superimposed the > seal of the City. In accordance with the latter rule we submit as a design > for the Municipal Flag of the City of Buffalo, the following: \\"The Coat of > Arms of the State of New York with the Seal of the City of Buffalo > superimposed upon the shield of the same all in blue upon the field of the > flag in Continental buff.\\" (Despite the assertion above, no such \\"general practice\\" of superimposing city seals over state seals has been documented.) Flag seal Though the Common Council passed an ordinance describing the official seal of the city and its flag, the seal described was not the one included on the banner. At the time there were several seals being used by various city officials. The seal depicted on the flag was actually the seal being used by the Mayor. There are a few differences, the most glaring being the legend surrounding the circle says \\"Seal of the City of Buffalo\\" instead of \\"City of Buffalo, Incorporated 1832.\\" The Mayoral seal also depicts two mules, nonexistent in the Common Council version, pulling the canal boat in the opposite direction described by the Council. The large ship and the pier are also completely different. Current flag In 1922, mayor Francis X. Schwab remarked to the Common Council that the flag did not sufficiently represent the city and proposed a contest for a new flag. After the contest failed to produce a winning design, a new contest was proposed with a more substantial reward. Seventy-three designs were submitted and the City Planning Committee with input from the Fine Arts Academy selected the new flag based on its simplicity and distinctiveness. The $250 reward was given to local architect Louis Greenstein. The flag was adopted on May 7, 1924, and dedicated to the city on the following Flag Day, June 14, 1924. Louis Greenstein's home still stands today at 64 Tudor Place and Cleveland across from Nardin Academy. Symbolism The city flag is meant to illustrate the energy and zeal behind the spirit of Buffalo. According to then mayor Schwab, it signifies the love and admiration which Buffalonians have for their city. The thirteen stars signify New York's status as one of the original Thirteen Colonies. The matching number of electric flashes celebrate Buffalo as one of the first cities to deploy electric service widely.

However only foundations and a dilapidated seawall still survive from these uses. Rainsford Island hospital facilities were expanded and improved in the early 19th century. A huge Greek Revival-style building, the Stone Hospital or Greek Temple,Grecian Temple on Rainsford Island was built in 1832 by Josiah Rogers. The Stone Hospital may have been designed by his brother, the American architect Isaiah Rogers, who was celebrated for his designs of the Boston and New York Merchants' Exchange, the U.S. Treasury Building in Washington, D.C., and the Tremont Hotel in Boston.cf.

Guthrie also pioneered the collection of whole blood on specially designed filter paper, commonly known as \\"Guthrie cards\\" as a sample medium that could be easily collected, transported and tested. Although Guthrie is best known for developing the test for phenylketonuria, he worked tirelessly to raise awareness of the need to screen for treatable conditions and adapted his method to early screening tests for galactosemia and maple syrup urine disease. Early life Guthrie received his doctorate from the University of Minnesota, although his education took a circuitous route, as he eventually earned six degrees in six years, including both a medical doctorate and a doctor of philosophy. While in school, Guthrie married Margaret, a fellow student, and they eventually had six children together. His early research into bacterial inhibition assays came while he was employed by the Staten Island Public Health Hospital, testing antibiotic sensitivity. Research interests Guthrie became interested in causes and prevention of mental retardation after his son, John, was born disabled in 1947. Despite his work in the field, the cause of his son's disability was never diagnosed. In 1958, Guthrie's 15-month-old niece was diagnosed with phenylketonuria (PKU), a condition in which the body cannot metabolize phenylalanine. Untreated PKU results in irreversible neurological damage. After the discovery of PKU as a cause of mental retardation, Horst Bickel and colleagues discovered that it could be treated successfully with a diet low in phenylalanine. The main drawback in successful treatment of PKU was the delay in identifying affected individuals. The common test for PKU at the time was mixing urine with ferric chloride. The excess phenylpyruvic acid in the urine of an individual with PKU would produce a bright green colour when reacting with the ferric chloride. Infants do not excrete high enough concentrations of this compound to give a positive test result, thus delaying their diagnosis, and allowing irreversible damage to take place. Guthrie's disabled son had driven his interest in causes of mental retardation, the diagnosis of his niece with PKU turned his attention to preventable causes. Others working with children who had PKU asked Guthrie to focus on a test that would allow for earlier identification, before irreversible damage had taken place. The Guthrie test Whole blood being collected on filter paper for newborn screening. Guthrie developed a simple method to screen for elevated phenylalanine levels using a bacterial inhibition assay. He cultured Bacillus subtilis on agar in the presence of a phenylalanine antagonist, inhibiting the growth. When exposed to blood from patients affected with PKU, the high levels of phenylalanine overcame the inhibition, and bacterial growth was visible. This assay was initially developed to allow monitoring of phenylalanine concentrations in known patients on dietary treatment using serum spotted onto filter paper. Guthrie recognized both the utility of this method as a screening test, and the need to eliminate serum as the sample type to minimize processing. He tested the assay using whole blood collected on filter paper from a heel stick. The collection of whole blood on special filter paper developed by Guthrie is still used in newborn screening programs around the world, allowing babies to be screened shortly after birth for a number of treatable conditions. After establishing a test that could identify PKU in whole blood spots, Guthrie set out to test his method, starting in an institution in New York. Here, his test correctly identified all patients known to have PKU and also four who had previously been undiagnosed. In 1961, Guthrie and his lab started screening infants for PKU, a project that quickly expanded. In two years, they had tested 400,000 American newborns, and diagnosed 39 with PKU. This early diagnosis allowed for early treatment and avoidance of the most severe consequences of the disease. Throughout the 1960s, PKU testing expanded in the United States and around the world, eventually becoming required by law in many jurisdictions. With the success of PKU testing, Guthrie and his colleagues focused on screening tests for other diseases that can affect newborns. They developed bacterial inhibition assays for galactosemia and maple syrup urine disease that could be run using the same sample collection as the PKU test. Patent controversy Guthrie decided that commercial production would be the most efficient way to manufacture 400,000 test kits, so he approached the Ames Company, a division of Miles Laboratories, which manufactured the older PKU tests. Ames said it would only manufacture the kits if a patent was issued, so Guthrie filed a patent application in 1962 and signed an exclusive licensing agreement with Miles, under which he would receive no royalties and 5% of the proceeds would be divided among the National Association for Retarded Children Research Fund, the Association for Aid of Crippled Children, and the University of Buffalo Foundation. Miles couldn't produce the kits fast enough, so Guthrie produced his own kits for 500 tests at a cost of $6 each. But in 1963, he found out that Ames planned to charge $262 for the same kit. Guthrie was appalled, but Ames wouldn't lower their price. Guthrie appealed to the U.S. Children's Bureau, which sponsored the field trial, and the Children's Bureau recommended that Miles not be granted exclusive commercial rights. Most of the funding to develop the tests had come from the Children's Bureau ($742,0000) and the Public Health Service ($251,700). The surgeon general determined that the invention belonged to the United States and abrogated the exclusive licensing agreement. The dispute was the subject of a May, 1965 hearing by the Monopoly Subcommittee of the Select Committee on Small Business of the U.S. Senate. Committee chair Russell B. Long (D-LA) denounced the award of private patent rights on federally funded research, and said, \\"when the desire to make monopoly profits at the public's expense can adversely affect the health of our children, it is time to call a halt to this immoral and evil practice.\\" One of the defenders of Ames was Senator Birch Bayh (D-IN), who, with Senator Robert Dole (R-KS), in 1980 introduced the Bayh-Dole Act which allowed universities and small businesses to retain ownership of inventions developed with federal funding.  Legacy  For the 100th birthday of Robert Guthrie the European Society for Phenylketonuria and Allied Disorders Treated as Phenylketonuria invited Patricia Guthrie to the annual conference to give a speech about her father. In subsequence she launched the Robert Guthrie Legacy Project to honor the efforts of Robert Guthrie to Phenylketonuria. His birthday, June 28, which is the same as the one of Horst Bickel, was taken up to launch the International PKU Day.

The surname originates from the Middle Irish '√öa Fael√°in' (plural, 'U√≠ Fael√°in') the name of the 10th to 11th century ruling dynasty of the D√©isi, a population group inhabiting the area of the modern county of Waterford and County Kilkenny in the early medieval period. The word \\"faol√°n\\" is derived from the Old Irish word \\"fael√°n\\" meaning a small wolf; '-√°n' being of the diminutive suffix in Irish. \\"√ì\\" (anglicised as \\"O'\\") derives from the Old Irish \\"√∫a\\", meaning \\"grandson\\", or more figuratively \\"patrilineal descendant\\". The patronym that follows is always in the genitive case, in accordance with Irish grammatical rules, and is normally marked by an \\"i\\" following the final vowel. Therefore, the name Fael√°n, becomes \\"√öa Fael√°in\\" as a patronym in Middle Irish, from which is derived \\"√ì Faol√°in\\" in Modern Irish, of which in turn \\"Whelan\\", \\"Phelan\\", \\"O'Phelan\\" etc. are anglicisations. According to the legendary history of Ireland, about 300 A.D., the D√©isi settled on the site of Dungarvan, County Waterford. In the 12th and 13th centuries, during the early Anglo-Norman period, records of a political nature relating to the D√©isi and the descendants of the U√≠ Fael√°in dynastic group decline. The Fael√°n referred to is Fael√°n mac Cormac, who is recorded in the Annals of Inishfallen as having succeeded his father as king of the D√©isi in 966. The first person referred to as \\"√∫a Fael√°in\\" is his grandson Mothla mac Domnall, or Mothla √∫a Fael√°in, who was king of the D√©isi until his death at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, and whose head is recorded in the Annals of Ulster as having been interred with Brian Bor√∫ in Armagh. During this period however, Irish patronyms had not yet petrified into surnames proper. According to the Annals of the Four Masters: > The Age of Christ, 1170. M1170.11 Robert Fitz Stephen and Richard, son of > Gilbert, i.e. Earl Strongbow, came from England into Ireland with a numerous > force, and many knights and archers, in the army of Mac Murchadha [Dermot > MacMurrough], to contest Leinster for him, and to disturb the Irish of > Ireland in general; and Mac Murchadha gave his daughter to the Earl > Strongbow for coming into his army. They took Loch Garman [Wexford town; a > stone walled Norse settlement], and entered Port-Lairge [Waterford town; a > Norse settlement] by force; and they took Gillemaire, the officer of the > fortress, and Ua Faelain, lord of the Deisi, and his son, and they killed > seven hundred persons there. By the beginning of the thirteenth century, most of the territory of the D√©isi was absorbed into the Anglo-Norman colony. The surname 'Whelan' remains common in County Waterford and in the adjoining part of Co. Kilkenny, particularly in the barony of Iverk. The earliest anglicised forms of the √ì Faol√°in name were Felan, Faelan, Hyland, with many other similar variants, including Whelan and Phelan in Cos Waterford and Kilkenny. Whelan and Whalen are the most prevalent forms in modern times, and combined are placed seventy-ninth in the list of the hundred most common surnames in Ireland.

The company has over 350 vessels managed by an international team of over 7000 staff worldwide. The group was founded by Sir Yue-Kong Pao in Hong Kong in 1955 as World-Wide Shipping. In 2003, the company acquired Bergesen d.y. ASA, Norway's largest shipping company, which was founded in 1935 by Sigval Bergesen the Younger. In 2005, the business was re-branded as BW. With its LNG and LPG fleets combined, BW Group owns and operates the world's largest gas shipping fleet of more than 70 large gas vessels, including four FSRUs (floating storage and regasification units). Hafnia, a member of the BW Group, operates the world‚Äôs largest fleet of oil product tankers, and BW Offshore comprises the second largest number of floating oil and gas production units (FPSOs). BW‚Äôs controlled fleet of over 350 ships also includes crude oil supertankers and dry bulk carriers. BW Group currently comprises BW LPG, BW LNG, Epic Gas, DHT, Hafnia, BW Dry Cargo, BW Offshore, BW Energy, and BW Solar. Overview BW Group is built on the foundations of two long-standing shipping businesses: World-Wide Shipping (founded by Sir Yue-Kong Pao) and Bergesen d.y., which was acquired by World-Wide in 2003. In the late 1970s, two British Hongs were taken over by Chinese entrepreneurs: Hutchison Whampoa Ltd by Li Ka-Shing, and Kowloon Wharf by Sir Yue-Kong Pao. Sir Y.K. Pao was a native from Ningbo, Zhejiang province who came to Hong Kong in 1949 and acquired an aging ship to establish the Worldwide Shipping Company in 1955. At its peak in 1979, World- Wide had 204 ships totaling . When the shipping downturn started in 1978, World-Wide sold tonnage while prices were still reasonable, paying off debt and building cash resources. In less than five years the fleet had halved in size, allowing World-Wide to avoid the crises suffered by many shipping companies. In 1989, Pao passed on his interest in World-Wide to his eldest daughter, Anna Sohmen-Pao, shortly before his death in 1991. World-Wide was ranked as the sixth largest shipping fleet (number of vessels) in the world in 2004 and has been chaired by Helmut Sohmen, Pao's eldest daughter's husband, since 1986. In late 2000, following a period of stake building starting in Bergesen d.y., the Sohmen family came to an agreement in March 2003 with Morten Bergesen and Petter Sundt, the controlling family shareholders, to buy their interest in Bergesen and mount a full public offering for all outstanding shares. In 2004, following completion of this transaction, there was a reorganisation of the Sohmen family interests, with the creation of a new top holding company, Bergesen Worldwide Ltd., registered in Bermuda, which is owned 93% by the Sohmen family and 7% by HSBC. The holding company was subsequently renamed BW Group Limited. In 2005, a further re-organisation took place, accompanied by the re-branding of the business under a single group brand, BW. BW Gas was listed in Oslo in October 2005 as a pure gas shipping company with BW Group retaining a majority share. BW Offshore followed suit by being listed in May 2006. The other assets remain in private ownership. In 2009, BW Gas was privatised. On 21 November 2013, the LPG business was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange as BW LPG. History=Background BW Group is made up of two long-standing shipping businesses: World-Wide Shipping and Bergesen d.y. ASA, which was acquired by the former in 2003. To reflect this acquisition, a new holding company, Bergesen Worldwide Ltd. was incorporated in Bermuda. In 2005, the business was re-branded as BW. World-Wide Shipping's beginnings Sir Yue-Kong Pao (more commonly known as Sir Y.K. Pao) started World-Wide Steamship Company Limited with his father S.L. Pao, brother H.K. Pao and friends C.L. Pan, P.C. Lee, T.H. Chiang, A.P.Y. Waung, W.S. Cheng and Y.S. Zee. The new company was incorporated in Hong Kong in July 1955. The company's first ship Inchona, a 27-year old coal-burning steamer, was renamed Golden Alpha. Several other ships were quickly added to the fleet and were chartered by Japanese and Hong Kong companies. It was a decision that other ship-owners deemed unusual and risky although it soon paid off. In 1956 freight charges rose rapidly due to the closure of the Suez Canal during the Suez Crisis. Over the years, the company‚Äôs fleet grew and by 1979 it had over 200 vessels and group tonnage of 20.5 million DWT, making it larger than the US and Soviet merchant fleets combined. World-Wide's entry into tanker market and oil crises During the 1960s, Sir Y.K. Pao was determined to enter the tanker market. However, his lack of experience meant oil companies refused to charter his vessels. He was rejected by Shell Oil and various American oil companies. Nonetheless, he managed to break into the market by acquiring a second-hand tanker that came attached with a charter. The tanker, renamed World Oriental, was soon joined by World Continental and World Universal. Pao continued approaching potential customers and then Standard Oil-Esso eventually gave him a chance. By 1964, Pao had nine tankers that were chartered by oil companies. The company's first very large crude carrier (VLCC) was constructed by Kawasaki Heavy Industries and named World Chief in 1969. Another 42 VLCCs were added to the fleet between 1970 and 1974 and most were constructed in Japan. World-Wide survived the first oil crisis as it had reliable charterers for its vessels. However, the company had to implement drastic measures to survive the second oil crisis. Anna Pao's husband, Dr. Helmut Sohmen convinced Pao of the severity of the crisis. The founder then promptly sold 140 ships within five years. The timely sales ensured that World-Wide Shipping was in a much better state than its competitors after the crisis as it was in a better position to cope with the increasing popularity of voyage charters and low freight costs. Change of leadership Sir Y.K. Pao retired in 1986 and Dr. Helmut Sohmen, who joined the company in 1970, took over. As shipyards were in a dismal state after the crisis and eager for new orders at low prices, World-Wide Shipping purchased six tankers from Hyundai Heavy Industries and Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering before the market recovered and in time to enjoy the higher freight rates during the First Gulf War. World-Wide Shipping again commissioned Daewoo to build another six VLCCs and Daewoo would go on to be the main builder of World-Wide's ships. Acquisition of Bergesen d.y. ASA By 2000, Dr. Helmut Sohmen had identified two companies, Bergesen d.y. ASA and Iino Kaiun Kaisha, which had good management and assets. However, the share prices of both companies did not appear to wholly capture the value of the companies. The Sohmen family's investment management team began investing in both companies and continued stake building for two years. Although Sohmen had conveyed his friendly intentions, Iino's management sought to maintain the status quo and did not want World-Wide to hold more shares than the largest shareholder. Respecting Iino's wishes, World-Wide called off the plan and sold off its shares at a profit. Bergesen cousins Morten Bergesen and Petter C. G. Sundt, grandchildren of founder Sigval Bergesen d.y., reacted more positively. They were firm that any offer for their shares would have to be extended to all other shareholders as well. By March 2003 the cousins had accepted World-Wide's offer. World-Wide then mounted a public offer and accumulated over 90% of the shares. The acquisition received considerable media attention as Bergesen was both Norway's largest shipping company and also one of its best. Both groups achieved a high degree of cooperation and continuity and a new holding company, Bergesen Worldwide Ltd, was soon incorporated in Bermuda in 2004 to reflect this acquisition. In 2005 the business was rebranded under a single group brand, BW. Bergesen's beginnings Sigval Bergesen d.y. hailed from a shipping family. His great-grandfather Berge Bergesen started a shipping company in 1840 and his father Sigval Bergesen founded his own in 1887. Sigval Bergesen d.y. joined his father's company in 1916 and after disagreeing with his father's refusal to commission two large 15,000 DWT tankers from Odense Steel Shipyard (which was owned by A.P. M√∏ller), left the company with one of its contracts. He soon established his own company, then named Sig. Bergesen d.y. & Co., on 20 February 1935. The company was run by his partner, Erland Bass√∏e, for over four years after Sigval Bergesen d.y. accepted A.P. M√∏ller's job offer and served as the latter's right-hand man. The company first ship, Pr√©sident de Vog√º√©, was launched in May 1935. Charles Racine, named after Sigval Bergesen d.y.'s grandfather, joined the fleet in 1937 and Anders Jahre, named after the famed Norwegian shipping tycoon, was acquired in 1939. The Bergesen Fleet during the Second World War Just before the Second World War, Sigval Bergesen d.y. shifted the company headquarter from Stavanger to Oslo to facilitate communication with business contacts. The Stavanger office became a branch office which continued to be overseen by Erland Bass√∏e. During the war, the company's fleet of Pr√©sident de Vog√º√©, Charles Racine, and Anders Jahre was considered modern for its time and also fully in operation. The ships temporary entered the management and operation of the Norwegian Shipping and Trade Mission (Nortraship). Charles Racine was sunk by three torpedoes on 10 March 1942 although her whole crew was rescued. Anders Jahre continued sailing independently most of the time although she joined a convoy whenever she sailed from the Persian Gulf or an Indian Port. The last ship, Pr√©sident de Vog√º√©, was active in the Atlantic Ocean during the war. When she sailed into Stavanger's port on 20 May 1945, she was the first ship under Nortraship to return to Norway. Rosenberg Shipyard Years of working for A.P. M√∏ller, no doubt convinced Sigval Bergesen d.y. of the strategic importance of having a shipyard. After learning that Norges Bank intended to sell its Rosenberg Mekaniske Verksted shares, Sigval Bergesen d.y. bought those shares at a price decided by the bank. As such, he gained a quarter of the shipyard's shares and would later go on to secure full ownership. Rosenberg delivered Berge Bergesen, a 16000 DWT vessel, in 1951 and then Crown Princess M√§rtha of Norway was the ship's sponsor. At the point of its creation, it was the largest vessel ever constructed in Norway. Initially Rosenberg's building berth could only fit vessels of 33000 DWT and below. A larger dry dock that could fit vessels of 85000 DWT and below was built to meet the company's demand for greater tonnage. The shipyard was also expanded in the 1960s so it could construct even bigger vessels of up to 160000 DWT. Nonetheless, after nearly 27 years, 43 vessels and much investment in the shipyard's facilities, it became apparent that Rosenberg could no longer fulfil the company's needs and was sold off on 1 January 1970. During its years under Bergesen's ownership, Rosenberg was graced by many notable guests. King Haakon VII, Crown Princess M√§rtha, King Olav V, Princess Astrid and Norwegian Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen were some of the illustrious visitors to the shipyard. Sigval Bergesen d.y.'s retirement Sigval Bergesen d.y. retired in 1976 at the age of 83. The control of his company went to Jacob E. Jacobsen and Sigval Bergesen d.y.'s grandsons Morten Sigval Bergesen and Petter C. G. Sundt. Jacob E. Jacobsen had been with the company since the very start while both grandsons were made partners a year before taking over the leadership. Sigval Bergesen d.y. passed away on 7 May 1980 at the age of 87. Starting and expanding a gas tanker fleet In 1974, Fearnley & Eger, a shipping company likewise based in Norway, decided to expand its gas tanker fleet and commissioned seven gas carriers. One order was passed to Bergesen and another to Gotaas-Larsen A/S. However, Fearnley & Eger faced financial difficulty in seeing the remaining deals through and another four of their contracts were transferred to Bergesen. Bergesen would also acquire the other vessel from Gotaas-Larsen A/S. These six LPG tankers were the first of Bergesen's gas tanker fleet. By the late 1980s, Bergesen was a prominent owner and operator of large LPG tankers. In 1999, it was decided that Bergesen would specialise in large and very large gas carriers while A.P. M√∏ller managed small gas carriers and Exmar focused on medium gas carriers. Going public and expansion On 1 January 1986, the various companies under Bergesen d.y. Group were merged and renamed Bergesen d.y. A/S. The company was listed on Oslo B√∏rs a few months later on the 9th of September. The company also began acquiring other companies. It acquired Den Norske Amerikalinje in 1995 but soon sold it to Wilh. Wilhelmsen Holding ASA. Its acquisition of Havtor AS, a gas carrier company, in 1996 increased its fleet size to over 90 vessels and cemented its position as a leading shipping company. Bergesen also diversified with its purchase of large ore carriers and FPSOs. Between 1986 and 2000, Bergesen acquired many large ore carriers including Berge Stahl (the biggest ore carrier in the world at 364767 DWT until Vale Brasil broke the record in 2011), Bergeland, Berge Nord, Berge Atlantic, Berge Pacific, and Berge Arctic. The company also had experience in the offshore sector with pipe-laying ship Berge Worker and FPSOs Berge Sisar and Berge Troll. As such, after negotiating with Statoil, it succeeded in attaining shared ownership of Berge Hugin which was converted into an FPSO in 1998. Acquisition and delisting World-Wide Shipping acquired the cousins' shares in April 2003. World-Wide then mounted a public offer and accumulated over 90% of the shares and Bergesen was privatised. Leadership of BW Group In 1990 third-generation leadership joined the company with Dr. Helmut Sohmen's eldest son, Andreas Sohmen-Pao. Sohmen-Pao has an M.B.A. with distinction from Harvard Business School and a double first class Honours Degree (B.A. Hons) from Oxford University in Oriental Studies in 1993.

James (Aphex Twin) released in 1994 under the moniker \\"GAK\\". The record is sourced from demos Richard D. James sent to Warp Records in 1990 prior to his signing. The album is rumored to be an imitation of the classic Warp artist LFO (British band). James recorded the songs possibly around 1989-1990. GAK 1 Is an example of early techno, mainly structured around a repetitive CR-78 pattern with a piano melody. GAK 2 is similar but has a more ambient techno sound than any other tracks on the E.P. GAK 3, however is a much darker, track with racing synths and a hard 4‚Äì4 beat, one of James' attempts to create a more rave type of sound. GAK 4 is a take on house music, rumoured to have been made as a joke, it is regarded by many as the best track on the record due to its happy vibe, and relaxed beat.

Character history Anna Fredericks first arrives in Salem in 1982, searching for Roman Brady, her husband and the father of her daughter, Carrie. For many years, Roman had been under the impression that Anna had been dead, when in reality she had been sold into slavery. Anna has several red marks on her back, which she claims were from being whipped but were in fact from multiple sclerosis. Following her divorce from Roman, Anna takes a job as Tony DiMera's secretary, while working in secret for Stefano DiMera who pays Anna $1,000,000 to have Roman fired from the ISA. To achieve this, Anna has Carrie hypnotized to place fake deposit slips in Roman's home. Although Roman is fired from the police force, the ISA are convinced that Roman had been framed.

It was nominated for the 1990 World Fantasy and Locus Awards in 1990, and won a Mythopoeic Award. As with a number of Powers' other novels, it proposes a secret history in which real events have supernatural causes: in this case, the lives of famous English Romantic writers‚Äîas well as political events in central Europe during the early 19th century‚Äîare largely determined by a race of protean vampire-like creatures known as nephilim. Drawing from European and Middle Eastern mythology, Powers depicts these beings as having qualities of vampires, succubi, incubi, Lamia, fairies, and jinn. Not only predators but sometimes benefactors of humans, they are the basis for both the Muses and the Graeae. The novel's title is taken from the poem \\"Sphinx and Medusa\\" by Clark Ashton Smith (\\"...Yet thought must see/That eve of time when man no longer yearns,/Grown deaf before Life's Sphinx, whose lips are barred;/When from the spaces of Eternity,/Silence, a rigorous Medusa, turns/On the lost world the stress of her regard.\\"). Plot The story begins shortly before the wedding of Michael Crawford, a doctor. The night before he marries Julia, he inadvertently places his wedding ring in the hand of a statue in a garden. When he goes to retrieve it, he discovers the statue has mysteriously vanished. Despite this mysterious event, the wedding proceeds. Julia's disturbed twin sister Josephine serves as the maid of honor. The next morning, Crawford awakes to discover Julia's horribly mutilated corpse next to him in the bed. Knowing he will be suspected of murdering his bride, Crawford flees to London and passes himself off as a medical student. He meets John Keats, who is also studying medicine. One day while visiting the wards they encounter the grief-stricken Josephine, who attempts to shoot Crawford to avenge her sister. A mysterious apparition saves him. Keats does his best to help Crawford understand what has happened. By placing the wedding ring on the statue Crawford unwittingly attracted the attention of one of the nephilim, who now considers herself Crawford's true wife. The nephilim killed Julia so she could have Crawford for herself. Keats, who has some experience with the nephilim, recommends that Crawford visit the Alps. There is a place high in the mountains where he may be able to free himself from \\"the stress of her regard\\". While traveling on the Continent, Crawford is called upon to assist another Englishman who is suffering from a seizure. The man is Percy Shelley, and is accompanied by Lord Byron, John Polidori, and Claire Clarmont. Byron and Shelley are also connected to the nephilim, which they see as both a blessing and a curse. The nephilim can prolong the lives of humans and serve as muses who help to inspire great works of creativity, but they are extremely jealous and will destroy anyone they see as a rival. Crawford and the two poets make their way up the Jungfrau, where it is said one might be able to break the bond with a nephilim. After answering a version of the Riddle of the Sphinx Crawford manages to free himself from his \\"wife\\". In doing so he also learns more about the nature of the nephilim. Yet the danger is not over for Crawford, the poets, and their loved ones. The nephilim are still active, and developments in Venice may threaten all humanity. Crawford, Josephine, Shelley, and Byron, all haunted by personal tragedy, must find a way to save themselves and the rest of the world from the nephilim.

Depiction in Captain Scarlet Well-trusted by the commander-in- chief of Spectrum, Colonel White, Captain Scarlet is the primary agent of the organisation and is assigned the most dangerous and crucial missions. He is a close friend of Captain Blue, who is his \\"field partner\\" and thus with whom he undertakes the majority of his missions, although he is on friendly terms with all other Spectrum agents. A close relationship with Destiny Angel is also hinted at several times in the series. Death and resurrection Captain Scarlet was killed in the first episode of the series, in a car crash brought about by the Mysterons, which also resulted in the death of fellow officer Captain Brown. Both men were reconstructed by the aliens, who assigned their exact likenesses of both men to assassinate the World President. The Captain Brown likeness was turned into a walking bomb for this purpose. When this attempt in New York failed, the Captain Scarlet likeness kidnapped the President from Cloudbase and flew him to England, taking him to the top of the London Car-Vu, a large car park tower. Cornered while holding the President at gunpoint over the city below, the Captain Scarlet likeness was shot by Captain Blue and fell 800 feet to his apparent destruction. However, at the end of the episode it was revealed that Captain Scarlet was returning to life and had become almost incapable of dying permanently due to the powers of the Mysterons, although the fall had broken the Mysteron programming and returned him to his original personality. This extraordinary ability heals Scarlet of physical injuries within hours, making him virtually indestructible. Captain Scarlet's Mysteronised body, like those of all Mysteron likenesses, is still vulnerable to electricity and impervious to X-rays. He also has a \\"sixth sense\\" when in the presence of a strong Mysteron influence ‚Äì he becomes nauseated, sweats, and suffers a severe headache ‚Äì but this sense sometimes does not indicate all Mysteron presences in an area. Though Captain Scarlet \\"dies\\" several times in the course of the series ‚Äì usually quite violently ‚Äì he always returns to life. In \\"Attack on Cloudbase,\\" Captain Scarlet is declared finally and permanently dead during the course of the battle for Cloudbase; however, this is later revealed to be Symphony Angel's hallucination as she is stranded in a desert, waiting for Spectrum to rescue her following a plane crash. Personality Captain Scarlet puppet at the National Media Museum Captain Scarlet, as the main protagonist, is one of the most developed characters in the series. His real name is Paul Metcalfe. He has black hair and blue eyes, speaks with a Mid-Atlantic accent and is said to be from Winchester, England. He was born on 17 December 2036. He is not unfamiliar with gambling and drinking, even though he has apparently lost his vulnerability to drunkenness; in the episode \\"Special Assignment\\" plays and loses heavily at roulette. (This is under orders from Colonel White; Spectrum regulations prohibit gambling on grounds of its potentials both for inducing compulsions and for inflicting heavy debt that could lead to financial crimes.) In the episode \\"Flight 104,\\" Captain Scarlet expresses a preference for steak \\"with all the trimmings.\\" Captain Scarlet is a competent pilot and can drive almost any vehicle; but in this last, he is only moderately skilled, as he tends to crash Spectrum Pursuit Vehicles (SPVs), the heavy-duty modified tanks that Spectrum employs (although this may be attributed to the fact that his indestructible nature 'permits' him to push the vehicles harder than others might as he knows he will survive whatever happens on the drive). He is also a qualified astronaut. He is a somewhat stereotypical hero in that he is dependable and always gets the job done although he is not always successful. He does, however, have a lighter side. He also has a rather dry wit and sarcastic sense of humour, often using this in dialogue with other Spectrum agents. He can turn his hand to a variety of weapons from guns to electric cables. Captain Scarlet is not shown to have any love interests during the series although previous attractions are indicated at some points, and a popular speculation among the fan community of the series is that he has a soft spot for, if not a relationship with, compatriot Rhapsody Angel. Captain Scarlet has a close friendship with Captain Blue, who acts as Captain Scarlet's \\"field partner.\\" Captain Blue cares about his friend and Captain Scarlet trusts him implicitly, although he is professional enough to use deadly force against him as necessary when Captain Scarlet was controlled by the Mysterons. In the episode \\"Special Assignment\\" Captain Blue tries to stop Captain Scarlet's apparent spiral of self-destruction, showing the bond between them. (It was later revealed that this development was part of a plan to infiltrate a Mysteron attack, the plan being kept secret from Captain Blue so that his reaction to Captain Scarlet's dismissal would be natural.) In the episode \\"Renegade Rocket,\\" both men are prepared to stay in a missile base targeted by the Mysterons and die in a last-ditch attempt to stop its destruction. Captain Scarlet is also friends with Lieutenant Green, as demonstrated when he accompanies Captain Scarlet and Captain Blue on certain missions. However, Captain Scarlet is friendly with all other Cloudbase personnel, and he has no particular enemies among those with whom he is closely associated. Depiction in New Captain Scarlet Born in Winchester, England, Scarlet's mother was Ann Brightman, a British astrophysicist, while his father, Tom Metcalfe, was an American pilot who later joined the International Space Agency. As a boy of ten, Paul watched his father take humankind's first steps on Mars and vowed to follow in his historic footsteps. He studied astrophysics at MIT before joining the US Air Force. However, the outbreak of global terrorist wars, which saw the deaths of both his parents, changed his focus. He transferred to US Special Forces and commanded an elite unit that saw action across the world. His second-in-command was Lieutenant Conrad Lefkon, who became his closest friend. With the end of the wars, a new security organisation was established: Spectrum. Paul was an obvious choice for the new organisation, and took on the codename \\"Captain Scarlet\\". His good friend Lefkon was also signed up as \\"Captain Black\\". Scarlet later became Spectrum's special weapon in its \\"war of nerves\\" with the Mysterons; a weapon created by the Mysterons themselves when they killed Scarlet during a mission on Mars along with Captain Black. After they had discovered the Mysterons' city, Black fired a destructive shot against it, believing they were under attack. The two men watched in astonishment as the city rebuilt itself and tried to flee, only to be killed. The Mysterons then rebuilt Scarlet as an invincible human replica to infiltrate Earth and lead their war against the planet. While under the control of the Mysterons, Scarlet tried to destroy Skybase, but was stopped in his efforts by Captain Blue. Falling down through a plasma stream, Scarlet was killed, but recovered later on in Sickbay, under the astonished eyes of Doctor Gold and other onlookers, and revealed himself to be fully free of the Mysterons' control. Metcalfe's human psyche had survived and regained control of his physical body. Instead of being killed by the power surge, Scarlet was only harmed temporarily, and was restored to life by the genetic mutation of the Mysteron \\"retrometabolisation\\" process which makes him virtually \\"indestructible\\". Scarlet is a dedicated Spectrum officer. First and foremost, he is a soldier on the front line of Earth's defenses. However, he is also tormented by what he has become not fully human. Utterly fearless and dedicated to saving the human race, for all Scarlet's heroism there is one thing that makes him very uneasy ‚Äì his growing feelings for Destiny Angel, the girlfriend of his late friend, Black. Abilities Through his power of \\"retrometabolism\\", Scarlet can survive and heal from any injury, no matter how serious, though his recovery is never instantaneous. Further, in a few episodes, it is stated that he can feel a Mysteron's presence by feeling nauseated and unwell. In the pilot story (\\"Instrument of Destruction\\", Parts 1 and 2), it is also stated that Scarlet shared a kind of telepathic link with Captain Black, which Colonel White considers to be an advantage in the war against the Mysterons that he cannot dismiss. During the episode \\"Rat Trap\\", the Mysterons were able to contact Scarlet and to talk to him, while nobody else could hear them. It is not clear if this phenomenon was because he was on the Mysterons' home planet, or if he would hear them, wherever he might be, if they chose to contact him again. In \\"Chiller\\", it was revealed that, when particularly badly wounded, Scarlet's body has the capability to separate his emotional and physical selves so that the latter can heal quicker, leaving the former as a ghostlike apparition, detectable only by its coldness. In music Captain Scarlet is referred to by The Kinks in the song \\"Daylight\\", on their album Preservation Act 1. Adaptation In the BBC Past Doctor Adventures series ‚Äì a series of novels based on Doctor Who, featuring the first seven incarnations of the Doctor in original adventures ‚Äì the novel The Indestructible Man by Simon Messingham draws heavily on Gerry Anderson's shows in general and Captain Scarlet in particular, with an organization known as 'PRISM' acting against the mysterious Myloki with the aid of Captain Grant Matthews, transformed into an indestructible state when he was killed and duplicated by the Myloki to such a degree that his original personality asserted itself. In keeping with the adult nature of this interpretation, Grant Matthews is presented as being tormented by his immortality, various sources noting that he is technically only a copy of Grant Matthews rather than being the original man in a new body, ideas that may have been suggested but never analysed regarding Captain Scarlet's nature in the original show. Background and reception Commentators consider the puppet Scarlet's appearance to be based on either Cary Grant, Roger Moore, or the character's voice actor, Francis Matthews. It is widely acknowledged that the character's voice was Matthews' imitation of Grant's Mid-Atlantic accent. In 1995, Matthews wrote that he was hired because producer Gerry Anderson \\"had heard my Cary Grant impression on Pete Murray's [BBC Radio programme] Open House and simply wanted that sound.\\" He also expressed his surprise at being so often identified with a puppet character to the exclusion of his other roles: \\"I think I have spoken many times about how unimportant Captain Scarlet was in my working life 28 years ago, and I can't give the impression that Scarlet has been a big thing in my life since ... [T]o be left with a piece of wood as one's main epitaph is becoming a bit galling!\\" Kyle Anderson of the website Nerdist.com writes that Matthews' impression of Grant \\"really makes the titular hero seem like a man out of time, which works really well.\\" Writing for TV Zone in 2002, Thomasina Gibson praised the puppet character: \\"... [H]ere was a hero, far superior to any that came before. Troy Tempest in his Stingray was far too wet! The Tracy troop in their Thunderbirds ‚Äì mere boys! No! The only colour that shone for me from the rainbow of agents pitched against Captain Black and the meddling Mysterons was the bright and vibrant Scarlet.\\" Commenting on the character's depiction, Stephen La Rivi√®re points out that \\"one element that was never dwelt upon, or indeed even mentioned again after the first episode, is that the protagonist we follow for the entire series is, in fact, nothing more than a duplicate, a doppelganger; the hero initially introduced to us is killed within two minutes of our first encounter with him.\\"La Rivi√®re 2014, p. 240. Comparisons have been drawn between Scarlet and the Whoniverse's Captain Jack Harkness, who has a power of rapid self-healing that makes him virtually immortal. Nerdist's Anderson describes Scarlet as a \\"proto-Captain Jack. He dies, but can always rejuvenate.\\" Criticism Jim Sangster and Paul Condon, authors of Collins Telly Guide (2005), argue that the puppet Scarlet's \\"indestructibility\\" reduces his credibility as a hero: \\"He'll survive no matter what they throw at him, which should mean that there's zero tension in anything he takes on.\\" Daniel O'Brien offers a similar assessment, identifying this ability as a \\"possible miscalculation\\" on the part of the series creators. To support his argument, he points to a line of dialogue from the episode \\"Attack on Cloudbase\\" in which Lieutenant Green scoffs that \\"anyone can be brave if they're indestructible.\\" Commenting on the 2000s remake, Andrew Billen noted that the character was now referred to as being \\"virtually indestructible\\", suggesting that the inclusion of this qualifier restored the excitement and \\"fixed every child's main objection\\" to the original series. John Peel believes Scarlet's self-healing power to be a major weakness in the original series' premise. He also suggests that the character served as a poor role model to the \\"impressionable children\\" who made up most of the audience: \\"Parents didn't like their children watching a show that appeared to be encouraging them to hero-worship someone who was indestructible.\\" He cites Batman as another 1960s TV series whose young viewers \\"sometimes tried to copy their heroes, often with nasty or lethal results.\\" Peel also believes that the incitement to re-enact dangerous stunts is sustained by the lyrical version of the end theme music, which features lines such as \\"They crash him, and his body may burn\\" and \\"They smash him, but they know he'll return ... to live again.\\" The inclusion of these lyrics led production company Century 21 to create an alternative set of opening titles featuring a disclaimer(in the form of a voiceover by Donald Gray, in character as Colonel White) declaring: \\"Captain Scarlet is indestructible. You are not. Remember this. Do not try to imitate him\\". Religious allegory Scarlet has also been viewed as part of a possible religious allegory in the series' premise. Various sources have commented on the idea that the character's self-healing ability makes him comparable to Christ.La Rivi√®re 2014, p. 258. Actor Cy Grant, who voiced the original Lieutenant Green, made several observations on the series' possible religious symbolism. He regarded Scarlet's ties to Colonel White as similar to those between God and his son; further, he considered Scarlet's nemesis, Captain Black, to be an analogue of the Devil. Stephen La Rivi√®re notes that like the ascended Christ, Scarlet lives \\"among Angels in the sky\\" (on Spectrum's airborne headquarters Cloudbase, defended by a fighter squadron codenamed \\"the Angels\\"). Gerry Anderson denied that any of this symbolism was intentional.

It is a design of a ring imaging Cherenkov detector where Cherenkov light that is contained by total internal reflection inside the solid radiator has its angular information preserved until it reaches the light sensors at the detector perimeter. The Cherenkov light is following a zigzag path between parallel surfaces. The light detectors would be positioned to the right. A charged particle travelling through a material (for instance fused silica) with a speed greater than c/n (n refractive index, c vacuum speed of light) emits Cherenkov radiation. If the light angle on the surface is sufficiently shallow, this radiation is contained inside and transmitted through internal reflections to an expansion volume, coupled to photomultipliers (or other types of photon detectors), to measure the angle. Preserving the angle requires a precise planar and rectangular cross section of the radiator. Knowledge of the angle at which the radiation was produced, combined with the track angle and the particle's momentum (measured in a tracking detector like a drift chamber) may be used to calculate the particle's mass. A DIRC was first proposed by Blair Ratcliff as a tool for particle identification at a B-Factory, and the design was first used by the BaBar collaboration at SLAC.

Occupying a total area of , the mixed-use building houses offices, apartments, a fitness center, and retail stores. Rising tall, the Mercury City Tower was formerly the tallest building of Russia and Europe, having surpassed the Moscow Tower of the neighboring City of Capitals complex (also in the MIBC) as the tallest of Russia and The Shard in London as Europe's tallest building.Ilya Khrennikov, 'Moscow Mercury City Tops Shard as Europe‚Äôs Tallest Tower', Bloomberg, 1 November 2012. The Mercury City Tower kept this record from late 2012 to the summer of 2014, in which it was surpassed by the South Tower of the neighboring OKO complex (also on the MIBC) as the tallest building in Russia and Europe. Currently, it is the fifth-tallest building in Europe.  History  Wireframe version of the tower Mercury City Tower was jointly developed by the American architect Frank Williams and the Russian engineering team Mosproject-2 under the leadership of architect Mikhail Posokhin. After the death of Williams in 2010, the Russians were able to convince Dutch architect Erick van Egeraat to succeed him and thus finish Williams' work. Construction of Mercury City Tower began in 2006. The project was estimated to be completed by 2009, but developers Mercury Development and Liedel Investments Limited preferred to slow down the project in order to not bring the building to the housing market during the Great Recession. By 21 April 2009, Mercury City Tower had just finished foundation work: finishing earthworks and five underground floors, and was ready for construction over ground. The estimated completion date was then pushed to 2010. On 1 November 2012, the Mercury City Tower topped out at , overtaking the Moscow Tower of the neighboring City of Capitals complex as the tallest building of Russia and The Shard in London as tallest building of Europe. It also became the world's tallest building built of reinforced concrete. Construction was finished in 2013. On the summer of 2014, the South Tower of the neighboring OKO complex surpassed the Mercury City Tower as the tallest building in Russia and Europe as well as the tallest building built of reinforced concrete. Construction was conducted with the help of a US$300 million loan from Sberbank, which created the ground for speculation about the possible transition of the building into ownership of the bank in 2015-2016. The loan was restructured in 2016. The whole cost of the project was estimated by business publications to range between US$650 million and US$1 billion.  Design  Mercury City Tower from the ground  Overview  The Mercury City Tower's distinctive copper- colored cladding makes the building stand out among its neighboring skyscrapers in the MIBC as well as the entirety of Moscow. The building was originally designed to be surfaced in reflective silver glass in order to mirror the buildings surrounding it, but this eventually was replaced by an equally reflective bronze-tinted glass. This gives the building a constant orange glow that makes it appear as it is embracing itself with the sunlight on the horizon. This was according to Egeraat in an interview with Arch.ru introduced by Egeraat's Russian colleagues. A media facede made of 2 million LEDs was installed on the exterior of the 67th and 68th floors of the building. Thus, the Mercury City Tower has the tallest media facade in Europe. The Mercury City Tower also has a unique setback shape, in which the building steps back twice along its northwestern facade, creating a tapering effect that extends the building's height in conjunction with the vertical skeletal striping that show its corners. Each setback has a slanted roof that supports the illusion of added height. For greater reliability, two independent reinforced concrete skeletons were provided to make the Mercury City Tower resistant against a 6.0 magnitude earthquake. This as a result gives the building a futuristic and high-tech look, fitting it in the Structural Expressionist architectural style. After Williams' death on 25 February 2010, his successor Egeraat stated it would be improper to make significant changes to the tower and focused on improving the upper levels of the building, elaborating a functional solution for the skyscraper, and developing interiors of public spaces.  Environmental  The building is claimed by architect Frank Williams as the first environmentally friendly building in Russia, since it was designed to collect melting snow water, as well as provide 70% of the workplaces with access to daylight. The building also features a smart ‚Äúenergy cycle‚Äù system that regulates energy usage, ambient temperatures, and hot water distribution throughout the development.  Features  Mercury City Tower is a mixed-use building, featuring offices, apartments, retail, restaurants, a fitness center, conference rooms, and parking spaces. The apartments are located on the topmost floors of the building, and was designed to merge units, adding to the tower‚Äôs overall space efficiency. The building has a total of 29 elevators, in which two of them are high-speed elevators travelling at a maximum speed of 7 m/s. Out of the 29 elevators, 20 are passenger elevators and 9 are service elevators. 10 of the passenger elevators operate with the TWIN system.

Sadlier published roughly sixty novels and numerous stories. She wrote for Irish immigrants in both the United States and Canada, encouraging them to attend mass and retain the Catholic faith. In so doing, Sadlier also addressed the related themes of anti-Catholicism, the Irish Famine, emigration, and domestic work. Her writings are often found under the name Mrs. J. Sadlier. Life Mary Anne Madden was born in Cootehill, Co. Cavan, Ireland December 31, 1820. Upon the death of her father, Francis, a merchant, Mary Madden emigrated to Sainte-Marthe, Quebec in 1844, where she married publisher James Sadlier, also from Ireland, on November 24, 1846. Sadlier experienced her most productive literary period after her marriage.Meehan, Thomas. \\"Mary Anne Madden Sadlier.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 8 March 2019 While living in Canada, Sadlier published eighteen books‚Äîfive novels, one collection of short stories, a religious catechism and nine translations from the French‚Äîin addition to assorted magazine articles she contributed to the Pilot and American Celt free of charge. Sadlier apparently donated her articles out of sympathy with the nationalistic causes of Irish journals. During her stay in Montreal Sadlier also wrote two novels set in Ireland: Alice Riordan; the Blind Man's Daughter (1851) and New Lights; or, Life in Galway (1853). In New Lights, Sadlier deals with the Irish Famine for the first time. The book proved one of her most popular, going through at least eight editions in fifty years. In this novel, Sadlier focuses a polemical attack on the Protestant practice of converting Irish peasants by promising them soup, but condemns peasant retaliation and violence. Sadlier published much of her work in the family's Catholic magazine, The Tablet. In the early 1860s, the couple moved to New York City. The Sadlier's New York home became the hub of literary activity in the Catholic community, and Sadlier also enjoyed the company of the brightest Irish writers in the United States and Canada, including New York Archbishop John Hughes, editor Orestes Brownson and Thomas D'Arcy McGee. She held weekly salons in her Manhattan home, as well as her summer home on Far Rockaway on Long Island (James, 219). Her closest friend was D'Arcy McGee, a poet, Irish nationalist exile and Canadian statesman known as one of the founding \\"Fathers of Confederation\\" who helped bring about Canada's independence. McGee and Sadlier shared an interest in a \\"national poetry\\" that would not only capture the spirit of a people, but inspire them to political and national independence. While McGee, as a man, could take part in political rallies and organize Irish-American support for Home Rule, Sadlier, as a woman, directed her support for Irish independence into literature. McGee's associates in \\"Young Ireland\\" included Samuel Ferguson, who in the words of one critic \\"become a link with the Irish Literary Revival of Yeats's generation \\"and were the founders of the Dublin newspaper the Nation\\" (Klinck, 169-170). McGee's biographer notes that Sadlier's success inspired him to write emigrant novels, and was planning a novel on this subject at the time of his death (Phelan, 285). McGee's controversial politics cost him his life, when an Irish-American radical who opposed McGee's shift to the right assassinated him in 1868. McGee, who sorely missed the Sadlier family after their move to New York in 1860, had been planning a visit when he was shot. His death was \\"a crushing blow to Mrs. Sadlier and her husband, who were his enthusiastic friends\\" (Anna Sadlier, 332). Sadlier edited a collection of McGee's poetry in 1869 in tribute to his memory. She remained in New York for nine years before returning to Canada, where she died in 1903. In later years she lost the copyright to all her earlier works, many of which remained in print. One of Mary Anne's daughters, Anna Theresa Sadlier, also became a writer.

He was a redoubtable campaigner for railway safety, often in the face of strong opposition, at a time when railway investment was being directed towards the expansion of the networks rather than the prevention of accidents. He was a member of the three-man committee of inquiry into the Tay Bridge disaster.Vetch (2004) Career Yolland was born in Plympton St Mary, Devon, the son of the land agent to Lord Morley, Plymouth, and his father promoted the boy's interest in surveying and land management by enrolling him at a school specialising in mathematics. He was commissioned into the Royal Engineers in 1828 and completed his technical training at the Royal School of Military Engineering in Chatham, Kent, in 1831. After service in Britain, Ireland and Canada he was posted to the Ordnance Survey in 1838. He made such a strong impression there, particularly with his mathematical knowledge and publications on astronomy, that in 1846 he was nominated to head the organisation by its departing Superintendent, General Thomas Colby. He was, however, thought too young for the post and an older officer (a sapper who had no survey experience) was appointed instead. This new Superintendent, Colonel Lewis Alexander Hall, despatched Yolland back to Ireland to avoid his embarrassment in commanding a more qualified officer, but the survey there was of greater importance than Hall had realised: Parliament had noticed that revenue was being lost as land assessments for tax were not up to date and Yolland's progress there was followed with interest. In 1849 he was called to appear before a parliamentary select committee to explain how his method of mapping settlements in Ireland could be applied in England, as more detailed town maps were urgently needed to assist in the planned reforms of town sanitation. The interest in Yolland's work in Ireland survives to this day: as a young man he appears as a leading character in Translations, a modern play set in nineteenth century Co. Donegal. The account of Yolland in Brian Friel's play is fictionalised, however, as he is called George Yolland and is missing, possibly dead, at the play's end. General Colby appears as \\"Captain Lancey\\". Yolland's technical account of establishing a triangulation base near Lough Foyle (1827-9) was incorporated as the \\"geodesy\\" section of the Royal Military Academy's curriculum for the training of military engineers. On his return to England he was placed in charge of the Ordnance Survey's new offices in Southampton, where he produced a set of maps of the City itself; in 1852, with Captain Tucker; R.E., he completed a plan of the city of York.Plan of York, 1852 (Sheets 1 - 21): Surveyed in 1850, by Captain Tucker; R.E. Engraved in 1851, under the direction of Captain Yolland, R.E. at the Ordnance Map Office, Southampton, and Published by Lt. Colonel Hall R.E. Superintendent, 1st. Sept., 1852. In 1851 Yolland was appointed to one of the judging panels for The Great Exhibition, serving with Colonel Hall in the military engineering category. When Colonel Hall retired in 1854 it was expected that, at the second opportunity, Yolland would be offered the Superintendent's post. However Hall, who had continued to resent his subordinate's abilities, succeeded in blocking the appointment. Yolland left the Ordnance Survey immediately afterwards. The Railway Inspectorate of the Board of Trade was invariably staffed from the Royal Engineers and Yolland, although still an army officer (by then a major) had no difficulty in securing a post with that organisation. Additionally, he was appointed to a commission to report on the best methods of scientific and technical training for military officers. His findings were accepted and his report was still influencing the training of military engineers (in Britain and the United States) at the end of the twentieth century. Yolland retired from the army in 1863, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, although he retained his position with the Railway Inspectorate. At a time when Britain's railway mileage was expanding at a great rate, his duties included the inspection of new lines and he took full opportunity to insist that the latest safety features, such as signal interlocking and block working, should be deployed. Yolland's campaign for continuous automatic brakes (he favoured the spring-and-ratchet system invented by James Newall) was initially less successful. At that time the Inspectorate had no statutory powers with regard to existing lines; all too frequently Yolland found himself reporting, in his characteristic rigorous manner, the organisational failures and neglect that had led to serious accidents. In 1877 he was appointed HM Chief Railway Inspector in succession to Henry Whatley Tyler. He died on 4 September 1885 in Atherstone, Warwickshire. Shipton-on-Cherwell accident (1874) Shipton-on-Cherwell Disaster (1874) One of the worst railway crashes he investigated occurred on the Great Western Railway near Oxford. The accident occurred on 24 December 1874 at Shipton-on-Cherwell, just north of Kidlington when a passenger train was derailed and crashed down the embankment. The investigation led by Yolland established the root causes very quickly, and further details emerged at the public enquiry set up by the Board of Trade. By tracing the marks on the sleepers behind the derailed train, Yolland established that the small 4 wheel carriage behind the locomotive had suffered a broken wheel, which disintegrated and caused the derailment. The driver braked hard and the carriages behind cannonaded into the 4 wheeler, crushing it entirely, as well as themselves running off the track. The accident occurred near to a small bridge crossing the Oxford canal and 34 passengers died from their injuries. Tay bridge disaster (1879) Fallen Tay Bridge from the north He was a member of the Board of Inquiry into the Tay Bridge disaster, with fellow members Henry Cadogan Rothery and William Henry Barlow. A train was lost on the night of 28 December 1879 while crossing the Tay estuary just south of Dundee. The centre section of the 2-mile-long bridge collapsed during a storm, with the loss of all on board the train. The inquiry sat initially in Dundee to hear eyewitness accounts of the accident, and then in London for expert evidence. They produced their final report in June 1880, and concluded that the bridge was \\"badly designed, badly built and badly maintained\\". Yolland went on to report on the state of other Bouch bridges, especially a very similar structure at Montrose, the South Esk Viaduct. The bridge was in a dire state according to Yolland in his Railway Inspectorate report, needing to be demolished and replaced by a safer structure. The directors of the owning company, the North British Railway, did not \\"feel free to adopt this suggestion\\" and the Board of Trade allowed the company to build a less expensive replacement.

The aim was to link 20 Secondary Technical Schools in Mexico City with 20 secondary schools in UK. The UVHS Philosophy Club had begun in spring 2001 and it was looking to develop a link with a South American country where P4C (Philosophy for Children) was strong. In September 2001, the UVHS Philosophy Club was invited to join a project initiated by the British Council and it soon began contact with Mexico. The UVHS ‚Äì Secundaria Tecnica #44 Link is now well recognised as being a successful and well-sustained school linking project. This has happened over the past 4 years due to the commitment of students, parents and teachers involved in the linking. Case studies about our link have been used in several British Council and DFES documents. It has been featured in the local media and in the Times Educational Supplement. Students and teachers regularly make presentations and offer workshops. The linking is now being embedded into curriculum of both schools. This development work forms the heart of the British Council Curriculum Development Award. History, Geography, Belief Philosophy and Ethics, Citizenship and Maths are currently directly involved. Great use is made of the Philosophy for Children technique which provides a democratic community for discussions to take place in. Communication between the two schools is mainly by email.

It's clever and knowledgeable, but highly unsatisfying.\\" AllMusic gave the album a two and half star rating out of five, \\"much more subdued than the usual techno-racket ¬µ-Ziq is known for\\" and compared the album to Paradinas first Slazenger album which \\"explored early-'80s electro -- that's all here as well (and it sounds just as dated).\\" The review concluded that \\"It makes one wonder whether an artist can be experimental and enjoyable when using all this cringe-worthy synth, but in the end, Paradinas pulls it off.\\" Track listing All tracks written by Mike Paradinas. # \\"Hung Like a Bull\\" ‚Äì 6:50 # \\"Supafunk\\" ‚Äì 5:19 # \\"The Big Easy\\" ‚Äì 5:25 # \\"Lumpback Raider\\" ‚Äì 5:46 # \\"Nautilus\\" ‚Äì 6:20 # \\"King of the Beats\\" ‚Äì 6:09 # \\"Gratuit\\" ‚Äì 7:27 # \\"Choin\\" ‚Äì 7:16 # \\"Sabbaf\\" ‚Äì 5:20 # \\"Hot Fumes\\" ‚Äì 3:13 # \\"Come on You Slaz\\" ‚Äì 6:19 # \\"Slowdance\\" ‚Äì 7:48 Credits Credited adapted from the Das Ist Ein Groovy Beat, Ja liner notes. * Mike Paradinas ‚Äì writer, producer, engineer * Paul Solomons ‚Äì cuts, editing * mitDR UK'96‚Ñ¢ ‚Äì design * Lord Peter Ashworth ‚Äì photography Notes Mike Paradinas albums 1996 albums Warp (record label) albums ","title":"Das Ist Ein Groovy Beat, Ja"},{"id":"6334319","text":"Wayne Hall (born 25 October 1968 in Rotherham, England) also known by his nickname \\"Ginner\\" is an English former footballer. He played much of his career at York City as a left-sided defender and is known for his shaved headed image. Career Starting his career in 1988 as a trainee at Darlington, Hall moved to non-league side Hartfield Main before transferring to York City in 1989. Hall would remain at the club until his retirement in 2001, notching up 438 appearances in total (373 in the league) and scoring 11 goals. Along with the likes of Dean Kiely and Andy McMillan, Hall would become one of the City's faithful's most popular players of the 1990s. The 1990s were a particularly successful time for City. They reached the playoffs of the Third Division in 1993; when the final against Crewe Alexandra at Wembley went down to penalties, Hall took the final penalty and scored, securing City's promotion to the Second Division. 1994 saw Hall along with City reaching the playoffs again, this time in the Second Division, although they were not successful. Hall played in two giant killings which further put the squad on the map came in the 1990s, first beating Manchester United 3‚Äì0 at Old Trafford and then the following season they beat Everton 3‚Äì2 with Hall in the squad. Hall retired from football in 2002 while playing for Gainsborough Trinity. York's fanzine Ginner's Left Foot is named in honour of the foot Hall used to score the penalty which secured City promotion to Division Two.

(Welsh language: Ie dros Gymru) is the name used to refer to two separate cross-party pro-devolution groups that were formed in the lead up to the 1997 and the 2011 devolution referendums held in Wales. 2011 campaign The 2011 group was launched on 4 January 2011 and co-ordinated the successful campaign for a 'Yes' vote in the 2011 Welsh devolution referendum to extend the law-making powers of the National Assembly for Wales. The group was chaired by Roger Lewis, the group chief executive of the Welsh Rugby Union., on the recommendation of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister for Wales - Carwyn Jones and Ieuan Wyn Jones. Lewis was not a member of any political party but having returned to Wales from a series of senior jobs in the music industry brought private sector credibility as well as a reputation for being passionate about Wales. The campaign was supported by both parties of the One Wales coalition government in the Assembly: Wales Labour Party and Plaid Cymru, as well as the Liberal Democrats. Although the Welsh Conservative Party were officially neutral all the Conservative AMs in the Assembly supported a Yes vote and the party group was represented on the Yes for Wales Steering Committee. The campaign also had the support of the other Permitted Participants recognised by the Electoral Commission: Cymru Yfory, Wales TUC and Unison. The Yes campaign was overseen by a steering committee chaired by Leighton Andrews, the Labour AM for the Rhondda and Welsh Education Minister. On a day-to-day basis it was organised by a small team of volunteers led by Campaign Director Daran Hill, former Labour Special Adviser Cathy Owens, and ex-ITV Wales Political Editor Lee Waters. The campaign set up more than 30 local groups across Wales and, within a two-month period from January - March 2011, succeeded in printing and distributing 1.5 million leaflets. 1997 campaign 1997 Yes for Wales logo Yes for Wales was also name of the cross- party pro-devolution group launched on 10 February 1997 to co-ordinate the campaign for a 'Yes' vote in the 1997 Welsh devolution referendum to create a National Assembly for Wales. It was supported by the Welsh Labour Party, Welsh Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru. During the 1997 campaign, the Welsh Conservatives were opposed to the campaign. The Yes for Wales organisation placed a great emphasis on grassroots involvement in the campaign and established local branches throughout Wales. It also managed the difficult job of pulling together campaigners and politicians with very different perspectives who previously fought each other tooth and nail. The pro- devolution campaign was fought against some fierce opposition from within both the Conservative Party and the Labour Party. Although the Assembly has gained increasing acceptance in both parties, these tensions still exist. The Yes for Wales! Campaign was chaired by Kevin Morgan, a Cardiff University Professor. The campaign's national organiser was Daran Hill. During the campaign for a Welsh Assembly, Diana, Princess of Wales died in a car accident in Paris, France. The campaign had been temporarily suspended, and it was wondered what effect the death of the Princess of Wales would have on the referendum. Many commentators were concerned that the death of the princess and focus on the Royal Family would distract from the devolution debate and affect voter turnout.

Tauons and D mesons are also copiously produced at B-factories. History and development A sort of \\"prototype\\" or \\"precursor\\" B-factory was the HERA-B experiment at DESY that studied B-meson physics in the 1990s-2000s before the actual B-factories were constructed/operational. However, usually HERA-B is not considered a B-factory. Two B-factories were designed and built in the 1990s, and they operated from late 1999 onward: the Belle experiment at the KEKB collider in Tsukuba, Japan, and the BaBar experiment at the PEP-II collider at SLAC in California, United States. They were both electron- positron colliders with the center of mass energy tuned to the œí(4S) resonance peak, which is just above the threshold for decay into two B mesons (both experiments took smaller data samples at different center of mass energies). BaBar prematurely ceased data collection in 2008 due to budget cuts, but Belle ran until 2010, when it stopped data collection both because it had reached its intended integrated luminosity and because construction was to begin on upgrades to the experiment (see below). Current experiments Three \\"next generation\\" B-factories were to be built in the 2010s and 2020s: SuperB near Rome in Italy; Belle II, an upgrade to Belle, and SuperPEP-II, an upgrade to the PEP-II accelerator. SuperB was canceled, and the proposal for SuperPEP-II was never acted upon. However, Belle II successfully started taking data in 2018 and is currently the only next-generation B-factory in operation. In addition to Belle II there is the LHCb-experiment at the LHC, which started operations in 2010 and studies primarily the physics of bottom-quark containing hadrons, and thus could be understood to be a B-factory of this \\"next generation.\\" But LHCb is not usually referred to as a B-factory as the experiment and (perhaps more importantly) the corresponding collider (that is, the LHC) are not used solely for the study of b-quark particles but have other purposes beside b-quark physics.

Data Becker was mostly well known for its web publishing software Web to date.Data Becker launches WebToDate 8, Netzwelt, October 18, 2011 (german) The 1980s: Home computing In the beginning, Data Becker catered primarily to users of Commodore 64 and C128 home computers, publishing an extensive range of books as well as programming tools and application software. The most advanced of the company's books delved deeply into the internals of the aforementioned computers and their peripherals, often revealing features that were undocumented by the manufacturer. The 1990s: Licences abroad In the United States, English editions of Data Becker's home computing books and software were published by Abacus Software. In the British market, initially First Publishing Ltd, did the same job, followed by Data Player Ltd t/a Data Becker UK from 1993 to 2001. The Danish and Norwegian markets were supplied with Danish language editions of the software and books by publishing house Nordic Computer Software (NCS). The French editions were published by Micro Application. In the late 1990s, in Germany, Data Becker also marketed Chessbase's Shredder and Fritz chess programs as 3D Schach Genie or Schach Genie. 2000: International failure In an attempt to become a worldwide publisher Data Becker UK ltd. was established in 1999. Data Becker Companies in the US, Spain and the Netherlands followed. Data Becker UK had initial success with their music- software range (Music Center was voted \\"Music Production Software of the Year\\" in 2000 by Future Music Magazine, Music CD Recorder, MP3 Wizard) but it soon vanished as the publisher pressed for a more family-oriented portfolio with titles like \\"3D Home Designer\\" and credibility in professional markets was lost.

The eastern end of the highway sustained extensive damage in 2012 when an inlet opened between Barnegat Bay and the Atlantic Ocean during Hurricane Sandy, scouring away the road east of the Mantoloking Bridge. The bridge and Route 35 intersection fully reopened in February 2013. Route description CR 528's western terminus in downtown Bordentown CR 528 begins at an intersection with CR 545 in Bordentown, Burlington County, heading east on two-lane undivided Crosswicks Street through areas of homes and businesses. The route crosses US 130/US 206 in commercial areas before continuing into Bordentown Township and passing a mix of farm fields, businesses, and residential neighborhoods. The road enters Chesterfield Township as it turns southeast and passes over the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) before coming to a junction with CR 672. CR 528 continues through areas of farms and woods with some homes, intersecting CR 660 at a roundabout and CR 677. After the junction with the latter, the road turns east in residential areas before passing more agricultural areas. The route turns southeast onto Jacobstown-Chesterfield Road at the CR 664 intersection and continues through areas of farmland, woodland, and residences as it crosses into North Hanover Township. CR 528 briefly joins with CR 665 at Jacobstown as it turns east into a mix of woods and homes as Jacobstown Road, turning southeast again to intersect CR 537, where CR 528 Truck heads east along CR 537. Past CR 537, the route continues into a mix of agricultural and wooded areas. View west along CR 528 at CR 537 in North Hanover CR 528 continues into Plumsted Township in Ocean County, continuing into the community of New Egypt, where the road passes homes and businesses. After intersecting CR 616, the route heads east onto Main Street and passes through the commercial downtown of New Egypt before turning northeast near more homes. CR 528 leaves New Egypt by heading east on Lakewood Road, with CR 10 continuing northeast along Main Street.

William Draper Best, 1st Baron Wynford, PC (13 December 1767 ‚Äì 3 March 1845), was a British politician and judge. He served as Chief Justice of the Common Pleas from 1824 to 1829. Background and education Best was the third son of Thomas Best of Haselbury Plucknett in Somerset. He became a student at Wadham College, Oxford at the age of 15, but left at 17 without a degree. Originally destined for a career in the Church, he instead chose to study law, and entered the Middle Temple on 9 October 1784. Legal career Best was Called to the Bar on 6 November 1789 and established a successful legal practice. In 1802 he was elected to parliament for Petersfield as a Whig, a seat he held until 1806. After joining the Tories, he sat for Bridport from 1812 to 1817 and then represented Guildford from 1818 to 1819. In 1813 Best was appointed Solicitor-General to the Prince of Wales, which he remained until 1816, and was then Attorney-General to the Prince of Wales from 1816 to 1818 and Chief Justice of Chester in 1818. The following year he was made a Judge of the Common Pleas and knighted. Best was admitted to the Privy Council in 1824 and appointed Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, in which post he remained until 1829. The latter year Best was raised to the peerage as Baron Wynford, of Wynford Eagle in the County of Dorset. Lord Wynford later served as a Deputy Speaker of the House of Lords. Despite his earlier affiliation with the Whigs, he became known as an ardent Tory, and vigorously opposed the 1832 Reform Act. Lord Wynford suffered from gout for many years, and was carried into the House of Lords in an arm-chair, in which he was also allowed to address the rest of the house. However, he was later forced to retire from public life due to his illness.

At the First Battle of Picardy each side had attacked expecting to advance round an open northern flank and found instead that troops had arrived from further south and extended the flank northwards. The Tenth Army, led by General Louis Maud'huy, attacked advancing German forces on 1 October and reached Douai, where the 6th Army under Crown Prince Rupprecht counter-attacked, as three corps of the German 1st, 2nd and 7th armies attacked further south. The French were forced to withdraw towards Arras and Lens was occupied by German forces on 4 October. Attempts to encircle Arras from the north were defeated and both sides used reinforcements to try another flanking move further north at the Battle of La Bass√©e The reciprocal flanking moves ended in Flanders, when both sides reached the North Sea coast and then attempted breakthrough attacks during the First Battle of Flanders. Background=Strategic developments On 28 September, Falkenhayn ordered that all available troops were to be transferred to the 6th Army, for an offensive on the existing northern flank by the IV, Guard and I Bavarian corps near Arras, an offensive by the II Cavalry Corps on the right flank of the 6th Army, across Flanders to the coast and an acceleration of the operations at the Siege of Antwerp, before it could be reinforced. Rupprecht intended to halt the advance of the French on the west side of Arras and conduct an enveloping attack around the north of the city. Prelude=Battle of Albert, 25‚Äì29 September On 21 September Falkenhayn had decided to concentrate the 6th Army near Amiens, to attack westwards to the coast and then envelop the French northern flank south of the Somme. The offensive by the French Second Army forced Falkenhayn to divert the XXI Corps and I Bavarian Corps as soon as they arrived, to extend the front northwards from Chaulnes to P√©ronne on 24 September and drive the French back over the Somme. On 26 September, the Second Army dug in on a line from Lassigny to Roye and Bray-sur-Somme and German cavalry moved north, to enable the II Bavarian Corps to occupy the ground north of the Somme. On 27 September, the German cavalry (Von der Marwitz), drove back the 61st and 62nd Reserve divisions of General Joseph Brug√®re, who had replaced General Albert d'Amade, to clear the front for the XIV Reserve Corps to link with the right flank of the II Bavarian Corps. The French began to assemble at Arras and Maud'huy found that instead of making another attempt to get round the German flank, the subdivision was menaced by a German offensive. The II Bavarian and XIV Reserve corps, pushed back a French Territorial division from Bapaume and advanced towards Bray-sur-Somme and Albert. From the French XXI and X corps north of the Somme, with support on the right flank by the 81st, 82nd, 84th and 88th Territorial divisions under Brug√®re and the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 10th Cavalry divisions of the Cavalry Corps (General Conneau) to the south-east of Arras, defended the approaches to Albert. On 28 September, the French were able to stop the German advance, on a line from Maricourt to Fricourt and Thiepval. The German cavalry was stopped near Arras by the French cavalry. On 29 September, Joffre added X Corps which was at Acheux, north of Amiens, the Cavalry Corps which was south-east of Arras and a provisional corps under General Victor d'Urbal, of the 70th and 77th Reserve divisions, one in Arras and the other in Lens, to the new Tenth Army. Battle= 30 September ‚Äì 1 October  A French division arrived at Arras on 30 September and repulsed a German attack at the Cojeul river and high ground near Monchy-le-Preux on 1 October. The French were then slowly pushed back from Gu√©mappe, Wancourt and Monchy-le-Preux, until the arrival of X Corps. The French XI Corps was withdrawn from the Ninth Army and sent to Amiens; by 1 October two more corps, three infantry and two cavalry divisions had been sent northwards to Amiens, Arras, Lens and Lille, which increased the Second Army to eight corps, along a front of . Joffre ordered Castelnau to cease attempts to outflank the Germans opposite and operate defensively. From the northern corps of the Second Army and the Territorial and cavalry divisions nearby, Joffre created a under the command of General Maud'huy. The advanced on Arras, with the gap south to the Second Army, held by the Territorial divisions. Maud'huy was ready to begin an attack to the south-east past Arras and Lens, under the impression that the was opposed only by a cavalry screen, rather than three German corps which were preparing to attack. The westward advance of the XIV Reserve Corps, from Bapaume to Albert and Amiens, was stopped by French troops east of Albert. Five German cavalry divisions further north, were also confronted by French cavalry and infantry, while attempting to guard the XIV Reserve Corps flank. French reinforcements increased the possibility of a reciprocal French outflanking manoeuvre. Agents reported the massing of French and British troops, between Arras and Lille and that the railways between Lille, Douai and Arras had been protected by an outpost line, from Orchies to Douai and Arras. The 1st Guard Division and IV Corps were moved to the northern flank of the XIV Reserve Corps, to allow some of the cavalry divisions to redeploy. The I Bavarian Reserve Corps (General Karl von Fasbender), was withdrawn from Lorraine and moved to Cambrai and Valenciennes, intended to advance from Douai, in another attempt to outflank the French. The corps began to reach Artois on 30 September and before noon, was ordered to advance with all of the units which had arrived, to reach Douai before dark. Five battalions of the 1st Bavarian Reserve Division advanced north-west from Cambrai and parts of the 5th Bavarian Reserve Division left Denain heading westwards, also for Douai. The 5th Bavarian Reserve Division advance was stopped by French troops at Lewarde, short of Douai, until the village was captured in the evening, after which the division stopped for the night. The 1st Bavarian Reserve Division battalions also came within of Douai, after overcoming French troops at Cantin and Raucourt. Behind the advanced battalions, the rest of the corps arrived during the day. Both divisions were ordered to capture the town next day and occupy high ground to the west. The inner units were to pin down French troops in Douai, as the flanking units encircled the town and met at Esquerchin to the north-west. The envelopment failed, due to the distance to be travelled and the resistance of French skirmishers, which delayed the German advance. Douai was captured by nightfall and prisoners were collected by 2 October, mainly from Territorial regiments. Allegations that civilians had fired at German troops, led to the town being fined The Guard, IV and I Bavarian corps assembled on a line from Arras to Douai, opposite the Territorial divisions of General Brug√®re and attacked on 1 October, forestalling the attack being prepared by the .  2 October  The advance resumed on 2 October, with the 1st Bavarian Reserve Division in the south, attacking through Brebi√®res to St. Laurent and the 5th Bavarian Reserve Division to advance via Izel and Oppy to Bailleul-Sir-Berthoult. It was known that the French 70th Reserve Division was moving south-east, also towards Bailleul and Lens. The French advanced with a left flank guard facing Douai, to link with the 77th Division at Gavrelle and Fresnes. The French divisions had been rushed from the Vosges and were also deployed at short notice. A brigade of the 70th Reserve Division moved towards Fresnes and one advanced south-west to Gavrelle, ready to pause on 2 October and then push outposts southwards. The French moved south in parallel brigade columns, as the Germans moved west in divisional columns. Bavarian Reserve Infantry Brigade 9 of the 5th Bavarian Reserve Division, reached Esquerchin and set flank guards facing north, before advancing on Qui√©ry la Motte, when French artillery near Izel pinned down the German infantry and destroyed a German artillery battery. French infantry then attacked from Drocourt and forced the German columns to deploy and work forward closer to Izel, to try to overrun the artillery. Bavarian Reserve Infantry Brigade 11 advanced on Beaumont, Drocourt and Bois- Bernard, moving the rearguard round to the right flank, which arrived just in time to meet a French attack from H√©nin Li√©tard. Both German brigades attacked again and captured Izel, the heights east of Bois-Bernard and Beaumont Station. Later in the evening Drocourt and Fresnoy were captured and Bois- Bernard was entered, being captured by dawn on 3 October.  3 October  By the morning of 3 October, the German front line ran from Drocourt to Bois- Bernard and Fresnoy. To the south-east, Bavarian Reserve Infantry Brigade 9 attack on Neuvireul was repulsed by small-arms and heavy artillery-fire from Acheville. The brigade dug in between Izel and Neuvireul. In the 1st Bavarian Reserve Division area to the south, the advance was at first protected on both flanks and advanced to Fresnes unopposed. The advance on Arras continued, supported by artillery moved forward during the night and the Guard, 4th, 7th and 9th Cavalry divisions in the Scarpe valley. The cavalry was to cover a westwards move of the Bavarian divisions, the 5th towards Vimy and Th√©lus and the 1st to Th√©lus and St. Laurent. The cavalry were slow to move and the Bavarian infantry were held up by attacks from the north, until the cavalry arrived during the afternoon. Bavarian Reserve Infantry Brigade 9 managed to capture M√©ricourt after the 9th Cavalry Division arrived, which enabled the rest of the 5th Bavarian Reserve Division to advance and capture Rouvroy and Acheville. Around French patrols slowed the advance and the 5th Bavarian Reserve Division put flank guards out on the right for the advance on Gavrelle. French troops in Oppy engaged the Germans with small-arms and artillery-fire, which delayed the Germans until the success of a costly attack against Oppy and Neuvireuil. Costly German attacks were made on Beaurains, Mercatel and the Arras suburbs of St. Laurent-Blangy and St. Nicolas, which were repulsed and forced the Germans to move northwards. An evening attack by three battalions on Arleux failed, which left the French position from Arleux to Bailleul and Point de Jour intact. More orders arrived to press the advance and an improvised Group Hurt, took over flank protection to the north and responsibility for the advance from M√©ricourt to Avion; Group Samhaber was ordered to capture Vimy. The flank attack by the French 70th Reserve Division had been repulsed but the advance reached only Drocourt and Gavrelle instead of St. Laurent and Bailleul. The disorganisation in the 5th Bavarian Reserve Division, which had been caused by the urbanised landscape and the vigour of the French defence, was not remedied by the ad hoc groups and worsened on 4 October. The right flank of X Corps of the and left flank of the Territorial divisions to the south became separated, prompting Castelnau and Maud'huy to recommend a retreat.  4 October  On 4 October, Joffre made the independent as the Tenth Army and told Castelnau to keep the Second Army in position, relying on the increasing number of French troops arriving further north to divert German pressure. Foch was appointed as a deputy to Joffre, with responsibility for the northern area of operations, the Territorial divisions, the Second and Tenth armies, which were combined in the (GPN). A gap separated the two 5th Bavarian Reserve Division objectives and a battalion sent to capture Avion disappeared in the dark. An attack by a second battalion began at and quickly succeeded; the rest of the brigade advanced soon after but was engaged west of Avion, by French infantry and artillery firing from Lens and Givenchy. One battalion reached the Lens‚ÄìArras road but then managed to advance only another before dark. A desperate night attack then captured the wooded hill () between Souchez and Givenchy, before dawn on 5 October. Group Hurt arrived at dawn, paused at a wood near Li√©vin and then attacked towards a wood (now Bois de l'Ab√Æme) north-east of Souchez. A cavalry regiment had moved forward independently to high ground west of Angres by calling out to civilians that they were British cavalry. German troops entered Lens, which had been held by a group of French cyclists and a dismounted brigade of the 5th Cavalry Division. The progress of Group Hurt assisted Group Samhaber further south, to capture Acheville before daybreak, despite a determined French defence and then press on beyond two more defence lines was limited. The advance was stopped short of the railway embankment east of Vimy. New orders arrived for the troops to press on, as it was mistakenly believed that the French were withdrawing but the German infantry made no attempt to advance in daylight, over open ground and without artillery support. Another order arrived at to cross the embankment, take the ridge and (Telegraph Hill, now Hill 139) to no effect. Later on, after sharing out a large quantity of wine captured at Bois-Bernard, an attack began at and reached the embankment after thirty minutes. The advance continued up the ridge south of Vimy but missed La Folie (Hill 140) in the dark and ended up on but French troops had already retired from Vimy and the hill. Group Leibrock captured Arleux at on 4 October, made a costly advance to Willerval and then at was held up at the railway embankment and the village of Farbus until dark. As the units further north advanced, the Group was able to advance through Farbus and reach around midnight. The 5th Bavarian Reserve Division had managed a considerable advance, despite increasing French resistance, casualties and fatigue but Vimy Ridge had not been captured apart from . The 1st Bavarian Reserve Division had hardly moved all its attacks on Bailleul having failed, causing a gap to appear between the divisions. It was hoped that German cavalry divisions would be able to advance on 5 October and that the 7th Cavalry Division would manage to turn the French northern flank. An advance in the north was ordered for an advance on Notre Dame de Lorette (Hill 165), which took the chapel unopposed at as the rest of Group Hurt concentrated between Angres, Souchez and Givenchy. (The French artillery bombardment of the Lorette Spur, lasted into 1915.) Aftermath=Analysis The French had been able to use the undamaged railways behind their front to move troops more quickly than the Germans, who had to take long detours, wait for repairs to damaged tracks and replace rolling stock. The French IV Corps moved from Lorraine on 2 September in and had assembled by 6 September. The French had been able to move troops in up to per day and use hundreds of motor-vehicles which were co-ordinated by two staff officers, Commandant G√©rard and Captain Doumenc. The French used Belgian and captured German rail wagons and the domestic telephone and telegraph systems. The initiative held by the Germans in August was not recovered as all troop movements to the right flank were piecemeal. Until the end of the Siege of Maubeuge only the single line from Trier to Li√®ge, Brussels, Valenciennes and Cambrai was available and had to be used to supply the German armies on the right, as the 6th Army travelled in the opposite direction, limiting the army to forty trains a day, which took four days to move a corps. Information on German troop movements from wireless interception enabled the French to forestall German moves but the Germans had to rely on reports from spies, which were frequently wrong. The French resorted to more cautious infantry tactics, using cover to reduce casualties and a centralised system of control, as the German army commanders followed contradictory plans. The French did not need quickly to obtain a decisive result and could concentrate on preserving the French army. Local operations5‚Äì6 October= Foch arrived on 5 October, in command of all French forces north of the Oise and ordered the Tenth Army to end the fighting withdrawal and regain the initiative. Hasty counter-attacks were made from the area of La Folie, which quickly bogged down and soon after, parties of French troops were seen retreating from Vimy Ridge, through Neuville-Saint-Vaast (Neuville) and south of Carency. The Bavarians were ordered to pursue the French, Group Hurt to a line from Souchez to Carency and Camblain, while Group Samhaber advanced through Neuville-Saint-Vaast and St. Eloi to Acq. As soon as the moves began, French artillery-fire slowed the advance and Group Hurt was stopped at the east end of Carency and the higher ground to the south. Group Samhaber dug in around Souchez and on the Lorette Spur the infantry and cavalry dug in until the arrival of the 7th Cavalry Division. As the German advance had closed on Arras, the French defence became more determined and on , the Bavarians were counter-attacked all day. At Zouaves made a costly counter-attack north of Th√©lus and when the Bavarians attempted to advance they were engaged from the village. Eventually, the capture of Th√©lus enabled Neuville to be occupied unopposed but a new French defensive position was found at La Targette. The 1st Bavarian Reserve Division managed to capture Bailleul, which brought both divisions level late on 5 October, ready for a broader-front advance in the morning. Group Hurt was ordered to attack towards Camblain again, protected on the northern flank by cavalry. The Lorette Spur was a dominating position, which gave an occupant observation over much of the locality but the steep, wooded slopes gave cover to an attacker and artillery was difficult to bring to bear. The French could also fire on the spur from three sides. Should the Bavarians withdraw, the area of Ablain, Carency and Souchez would become untenable and a retirement was rejected. A further advance was not possible, because the cavalry had not arrived by 6 October and the 1st Bavarian Reserve Division was still further back around Bailleul and Point de Jour. The corps headquarters sent new orders at for the 5th Division to become a flank guard in the north, as all available troops attacked Arras. Group Hurt was to mask Ablain and cut the roads from the north. Group Samhaber was to attack to the south, capture the crossroads north of √âcurie and advance on Arras. the 1st Division was to attack at the same time from the west to a line from Roclincourt to St. Laurent as IV Corps and the Guard Corps attacked from the south. The 7th and 9th Cavalry divisions operating north of the Lorette Spur managed to hold on against probing attacks and bombardments from the north, south-west and south. The attack towards Arras faltered against increasing French resistance, a flank guard at Ablain having been attacked all day from the north-west and south-west. Troops were taken from Souchez and the Lorette Spur to cover the gap from Carency to La Targette until dark. On 6 October, Group Samhaber attacked St. Eloi through La Targette, which the French had abandoned but after was forced under cover by French troops near Berthonval Farm, until heavy howitzers near La Folie managed to hit the St. Eloi church tower and positions around the farm. The Bavarians were redirected southwards towards √âcurie and were then stopped near La Targette for the rest of the day, by French troops well dug in at Maison Blanche. At a rumour that German troops were in Arras, led to orders to attack again and a cancellation two hours later. In the 1st Bavarian Reserve Division area, the troops west of Bailleul and Th√©lus attacked Roclincourt at but were slowed on open ground by French artillery fire and two days without food and water. The 1st Division commander ordered that the attack must continue, to keep up with the 5th Division but by night the division was still short of Roclincourt and dispersed over a wide area, which the French exploited to get behind parties of troops and inflict many casualties. After dark the Bavarians managed to inch forward to within of Roclincourt and of a different Maison Blanche. =7‚Äì9 October= Ambitious orders were issued for 7 October, to advance north of Arras to Petit Servin, Mont St. Eloi and Mar≈ìuil, supported by attacks from the east by the 1st Bavarian Reserve Division, IV Corps from the south-east and the Guard Corps from the south. The arrival of the XIV Corps to the north ended the chronic problem of flank security but to the south exhaustion and the need to close gaps and resist French counter-attacks from reinforcements which arrived during the day. Group Hurt in the north managed to repulse French attacks but could not advance and was severely bombarded on the Lorette Spur, which forced some temporary retirements towards Carency. Group Samhaber failed to get forward to St. Eloi and no advance was possible towards Roclincourt, after the French Tenth Army had issued orders to X Corps and the 77th Division to hold their positions at all costs. On 8 October a special attack on Roclincourt was ordered for to prepare the way for another outflanking move from the north. Despite elaborate arrangements, only a small amount of ground along the Bailleul‚ÄìArras road was taken and the attack on Roclincourt was abandoned as a costly failure, one battalion being reduced to Attacks on the Lorette Spur towards Petit Severin failed and attacks by the 13th Division of XIV Corps in the north made no progress. During the afternoon the French made a general attack from Ablain to Neuville which forced the Germans and Bavarians to rush forward every spare man to plug gaps between units. At Carency the French 43rd Division took the west end and was then stopped by reinforcements rushed from Vimy who stabilised the front and took prisoner of the 31st Chasseurs. The 13th Division reached the Lorette Spur and dug in, which by nightfall meant that the German positions ran from Aix-Noulette to the spur, Bois de Bouvigny, west of Ablain, Carency, La Targette, Maison Blanche, Neuville, north of √âcurie, east of Roclincourt and south to the Scarpe valley. These positions marked the end of the battle of manoeuvre in the area, local attempts to advance were defeated by the French and by 9 October, German reliefs in line were under way, to reorganise the mixture of units, which took a week. Subsequent operationsFirst Battle of Flanders= To the north, the I and II Cavalry corps attacked between Lens and Lille and were quickly repulsed and forced back behind the Lorette Spur. Next day the cavalry was attacked by the first troops of the French XXI Corps advancing from B√©thune. On 8 October the German XIV Corps arrived from Mons and took over from the cavalry, which were sent north to resume their attack from La Bass√©e and Armenti√®res. The IV Cavalry Corps had moved north of Lille and on 8 October reached Ypres and then turned south-west towards Hazebrouck, where they were met by the new French I Cavalry Corps (General Antoine de Mitry) and forced to retire to Bailleul. By 9 October, the defensive lines established on the Aisne in September had been extended to the west and north to within of Dunkirk and the North Sea coast. On 3 October, Joffre formed the Tenth Army under General de Maud'huy to reinforce his left and prevent its envelopment. The XXI Corps arrived from Champagne and the 13th Division assembled west of Lille. =Lille 1914= The armament of the Lille fortress zone in 1914, consisted of and (including shells), of rifle ammunition and guns, which had been sent from Paris. During the Battle of Charleroi (21 August), General d'Amade garrisoned the area from Maubeuge to Dunkirk with a line of Territorial divisions. The 82nd Division held the area between the Escaut and the Scarpe, with advanced posts at Lille, De√ªl√©mont and Tournai, just over the Belgian border. The Territorials dug in but on 23 August, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) retreated from Mons and the Germans drove the 82nd Territorial Division out of Tournai. The German advance reached Roubaix and Tourcoing before a counter-attack by the 83rd and 84th regiments reoccupied Tournai during the night. Early on 24 August, the 170th Brigade organised the defence of the bridges over the Escaut but around noon, the Territorials were forced back by a German attack. The Mayor of Lille requested that the city be declared open and at the Minister of War ordered the garrison to leave the city and move between La Bass√©e and Aire-sur-la-Lys. On 25 August, the German 1st Army reached the outskirts of Lille and General Herment withdrew the garrison. Maubeuge to the south was defended by and the Belgian army was still defending Antwerp to the north. On 2 September, German detachments entered Lille and left three days later, the town was intermittently occupied by patrols, guarding the right flank of the 1st Army. After the German retreat from the Marne and the First Battle of the Aisne the northward manoeuvre known as the Race for the Sea commenced and on 3 October, Joffre formed the 10th Army under General de Maud'huy, to reinforce the northern flank of the French armies. The 13th Division of XXI Corps arrived from Champagne and detrained to the west of Lille. On the morning of 4 October, Chasseur battalions of the 13th Division moved to positions north and east of Lille. The 4th Chasseur Battalion advanced towards the suburb of Fives but encountered by small-arms fire as it left the Lille ramparts. The chasseurs drove the Germans back from the railway station and fortifications, taking several prisoners and some machine-guns. North of the town, the French met more German patrols near Wambrechies and Marquette and the 7th Cavalry Division skirmished in the neighbourhood of Fouquet. The new Lille garrison, consisting of Territorial and Algerian mounted troops, took post to the south at Faches and Wattignies, linking with the rest of the 13th Division at Ronchin. A German attack reached the railway and on 5 October, a French counter-attack recaptured Fives, Hellemmes, Flers, the fort of Mons-en-Bar≈ìul and Ronchin; to the west, cavalry engagements took place along the Ypres Canal. On 6 October, the 13th Division left two chasseur battalions at Lille as XXI Corps moved south towards Artois and French cavalry near De√ªl√©mont repulsed a German attack. On 7 October, the chasseur battalions were withdrawn and the defence of Lille reverted to the Territorial and Algerian troops. From the I Cavalry Corps engaged German troops between Aire-sur-la-Lys and Armentieres but failed to re-open the road to Lille. At on 9 October, a German aeroplane appeared over Lille and dropped two bombs on the General Post Office. In the afternoon, all men from ordered to the B√©thune Gate, with instructions to leave Lille immediately. Civilians from Lille, Tourcoing, Roubaix and neighbouring villages, left on foot for Dunkirk and Gravelines. Several died on the way of exhaustion and others were taken prisoners by German Uhlans. The last train left Lille at dawn on 10 October, an hour after German artillery had begun to fire on the neighbourhood of the station, Prefecture and the Palais des Beaux Arts. At on 11 October, after a lull since the previous afternoon, the bombardment resumed until and then continued intermittently. On 12 October, the garrison capitulated, by when had been killed, many fires had been started and the vicinity of the railway station was destroyed. Five companies of Bavarian troops entered the town, followed throughout the day by cavalry, artillery and more infantry. =First Battle of Artois= After studying the possibilities for an offensive the Operations Bureau of the French army recommended to Joffre a dual offensive, with attacks in Artois and Champagne, to crush the German salient in France. Despite shortages of equipment, artillery and ammunition, which led Joffre to doubt that a decisive success could be obtained, it was impossible to allow the Germans to concentrate their forces in Russia. Principal attacks were to be made in Artois by the Tenth Army towards Cambrai and by the Fourth Army in Champagne, with supporting attacks elsewhere. The objectives were to deny the Germans an opportunity to move troops and to break through in several places, to force the Germans to retreat. The Tenth Army was to capture Vimy Ridge, to dominate the Douai plain and induce a German retirement. From north to south, XXI Corps was to break through at Souchez and capture Givenchy, XXXIII Corps was to capture the ridge and south, X Corps would attack north-eastwards from Arras, to cover the southern flank of XXXIII Corps. Artillery support for the offensive would consist of including by 25 December. As a deception, the French sapped forward to reduce the width of no man's land to , at all places on the Western Front where an attack was feasible. Foch ordered Maud'Huy to slow the planned pace of the offensive, of successive attacks on several days, to ensure artillery support for the infantry, which was intended to substitute shells for lives. The offensive was fought from but despite the careful preparations achieved little. Artillery support was insufficient and rains turned the battlefield into a morass. XXI Corps managed a short advance and captured about of the German front trench and X Corps captured a small area of ground near Arras. The XXXIII Corps attack began next day and was equally frustrated by the German defence. Next day the corps concentrated its attack on Carency to little effect until 27 December, when of front-line trench was captured, only for most to be lost to a German counter-attack. Bad weather then delayed the offensive and on 5 January, Joffre decided to reinforce the Fourth Army, where the First Battle of Champagne (), had been more successful, with troops from the Tenth Army, the offensive in Artois being officially ended on 13 January.

Born and reared in Boston, he was of Jewish ancestry; from German immigrants who immigrated to the United States in the 19th century. Inspired by the Russian-American violinist Jascha Heifetz, Reisman studied violin as a young man. After being rejected by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, he formed his own band in 1919. He became famous for having over 80 hits on the popular charts during his career. Jerome Kern called Reisman's orchestra \\"The String Quartet of Dance Bands\\". Biography Mr. Reisman's first recording was on a 10-inch 78 rpm record for Columbia Records, recorded on January 10, 1921 ‚Äì the two titles being \\"Love Bird\\", with a catalog issue of Columbia A-3366, mx.79634 and the other title being \\"Bright Eyes\\", with a catalog issue of Columbia A-3366, mx.79635. Reisman recorded for Columbia exclusively from July 1923 through March 11, 1929, when he signed with Victor and stayed until October 1933. He then signed with Brunswick and stayed until 1937 when he re-signed with Victor. During his 1929-1933 Victor period, Reisman recorded many lesser-known period Broadway songs, some of which were recorded by no other band. Due to his popularity, he was always one of the prominent bands during his time at Columbia, Victor and Brunswick, and he recorded prolifically. Reisman also had the habit of featuring composers and Broadway performers as band vocalists, including Harold Arlen, Fred Astaire, Clifton Webb, and Arthur Schwartz. He also featured Lee Wiley in 1931-32 for her first 3 recordings. More often than not, his vocalists were Frank Luther, Dick Robertson and later Sally Singer and George Beuler. A notable recording from this era was \\"Happy Days Are Here Again\\" in November 1929, with vocals by Lou Levin. Among his more popular hits were his #1 recordings of Cole Porter's \\"Night and Day\\" (1932) and Con Conrad's \\"The Continental\\" (1934), and Astaire's recording of Irving Berlin's \\"Cheek to Cheek\\" (1935). Reisman's was primarily a dance orchestra; he was not a fan of jazz music, but some of his early 1930s 78 RPM recordings were a bit \\"hot\\". (However, Reisman employed the legendary trumpet player Bubber Miley in 1930‚Äì31, who had been a featured member of Duke Ellington's orchestra.) Eddy Duchin was a member of Leo Reisman's orchestra; it was Reisman who gave Duchin his big break.1 The Eddy Duchin Story. Columbia Pictures, Samuel A. Taylor (screenplay) and Leo Katcher (story), released 21 June 1956 (USA) The band leader and TV personality, Mitch Miller, also was a member of Reisman's orchestra. Leo Reisman died in New York City on December 18, 1961, at the age of 64.

Unlike ordinary spherical harmonics, the spin-weighted harmonics are gauge fields rather than scalar fields: mathematically, they take values in a complex line bundle. The spin-weighted harmonics are organized by degree , just like ordinary spherical harmonics, but have an additional spin weight that reflects the additional symmetry. A special basis of harmonics can be derived from the Laplace spherical harmonics , and are typically denoted by , where and are the usual parameters familiar from the standard Laplace spherical harmonics. In this special basis, the spin-weighted spherical harmonics appear as actual functions, because the choice of a polar axis fixes the gauge ambiguity. The spin-weighted spherical harmonics can be obtained from the standard spherical harmonics by application of spin raising and lowering operators. In particular, the spin-weighted spherical harmonics of spin weight are simply the standard spherical harmonics: :{}_0Y_{l m} = Y_{l m}\\\\ . Spaces of spin- weighted spherical harmonics were first identified in connection with the representation theory of the Lorentz group . They were subsequently and independently rediscovered by and applied to describe gravitational radiation, and again by as so-called \\"monopole harmonics\\" in the study of Dirac monopoles. Spin-weighted functions Regard the sphere as embedded into the three-dimensional Euclidean space .

A spin-weight function is a function accepting as input a point of and a positively oriented orthonormal basis of tangent vectors at , such that :f\\\\bigl(\\\\mathbf x,(\\\\cos\\\\theta)\\\\mathbf{a}-(\\\\sin\\\\theta)\\\\mathbf{b}, (\\\\sin\\\\theta)\\\\mathbf{a} + (\\\\cos\\\\theta)\\\\mathbf{b}\\\\bigr) = e^{is\\\\theta}f(\\\\mathbf x,\\\\mathbf{a},\\\\mathbf{b}) for every rotation angle . Following , denote the collection of all spin-weight functions by . Concretely, these are understood as functions on } satisfying the following homogeneity law under complex scaling :f\\\\left(\\\\lambda z,\\\\overline{\\\\lambda}\\\\bar{z}\\\\right) = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\overline{\\\\lambda}}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right)^s f\\\\left(z,\\\\bar{z}\\\\right). This makes sense provided is a half-integer. Abstractly, is isomorphic to the smooth vector bundle underlying the antiholomorphic vector bundle of the Serre twist on the complex projective line . A section of the latter bundle is a function on } satisfying :g\\\\left(\\\\lambda z,\\\\overline{\\\\lambda}\\\\bar{z}\\\\right) = \\\\overline{\\\\lambda}^{2s} g\\\\left(z,\\\\bar{z}\\\\right). Given such a , we may produce a spin-weight function by multiplying by a suitable power of the hermitian form :P\\\\left(z,\\\\bar{z}\\\\right) = z\\\\cdot\\\\bar{z}. Specifically, is a spin-weight function. The association of a spin-weighted function to an ordinary homogeneous function is an isomorphism. The operator  The spin weight bundles are equipped with a differential operator (eth). This operator is essentially the Dolbeault operator, after suitable identifications have been made, :\\\\partial : \\\\overline{\\\\mathbf O(2s)} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{E}^{1,0}\\\\otimes \\\\overline{\\\\mathbf O(2s)} \\\\cong \\\\overline{\\\\mathbf O(2s)}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{O}(-2).

Spin-weighted harmonics Just as conventional spherical harmonics are the eigenfunctions of the Laplace- Beltrami operator on the sphere, the spin-weight harmonics are the eigensections for the Laplace-Beltrami operator acting on the bundles of spin- weight functions. Representation as functions The spin-weighted harmonics can be represented as functions on a sphere once a point on the sphere has been selected to serve as the North pole. By definition, a function with spin weight transforms under rotation about the pole via :\\\\eta \\\\rightarrow e^{i s \\\\psi}\\\\eta. Working in standard spherical coordinates, we can define a particular operator acting on a function as: :\\\\eth\\\\eta = - \\\\left(\\\\sin{\\\\theta}\\\\right)^s \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} + \\\\frac{i}{\\\\sin{\\\\theta}} \\\\frac{\\\\partial} {\\\\partial \\\\phi} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\left[ \\\\left(\\\\sin{\\\\theta}\\\\right)^{-s} \\\\eta \\\\right]. This gives us another function of and . (The operator is effectively a covariant derivative operator in the sphere.) An important property of the new function is that if had spin weight , has spin weight . Thus, the operator raises the spin weight of a function by 1. Similarly, we can define an operator which will lower the spin weight of a function by 1: :\\\\bar\\\\eth\\\\eta = - \\\\left(\\\\sin{\\\\theta}\\\\right)^{-s} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} - \\\\frac{i}{\\\\sin{\\\\theta}} \\\\frac{\\\\partial} {\\\\partial \\\\phi} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\left[ \\\\left(\\\\sin{\\\\theta}\\\\right)^{s} \\\\eta \\\\right]. The spin-weighted spherical harmonics are then defined in terms of the usual spherical harmonics as: : {}_sY_{l m} = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{(l-s)!}{(l+s)!}}\\\\ \\\\eth^s Y_{l m},&& 0\\\\leq s \\\\leq l; \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{(l+s)!}{(l-s)!}}\\\\ \\\\left(-1\\\\right)^s \\\\bar\\\\eth^{-s} Y_{l m},&& -l\\\\leq s \\\\leq 0; \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0,&&l; < s.\\\\end{cases} The functions then have the property of transforming with spin weight . Other important properties include the following: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\eth\\\\left({}_sY_{l m}\\\\right) &= +\\\\sqrt{(l-s)(l+s+1)}\\\\, {}_{s+1}Y_{l m};\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\bar\\\\eth\\\\left({}_sY_{l m}\\\\right) &= -\\\\sqrt{(l+s)(l-s+1)}\\\\, {}_{s-1}Y_{l m}; \\\\end{align}  Orthogonality and completeness  The harmonics are orthogonal over the entire sphere: :\\\\int_{S^2} {}_sY_{l m}\\\\, {}_s\\\\bar{Y}_{l'm'}\\\\, dS = \\\\delta_{ll'} \\\\delta_{mm'}, and satisfy the completeness relation :\\\\sum_{l m} {}_s\\\\bar Y_{l m}\\\\left(\\\\theta',\\\\phi'\\\\right) {}_s Y_{l m}(\\\\theta,\\\\phi) = \\\\delta\\\\left(\\\\phi'-\\\\phi\\\\right)\\\\delta\\\\left(\\\\cos\\\\theta'-\\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\right) Calculating These harmonics can be explicitly calculated by several methods. The obvious recursion relation results from repeatedly applying the raising or lowering operators. Formulae for direct calculation were derived by . Note that their formulae use an old choice for the Condon‚ÄìShortley phase. The convention chosen below is in agreement with Mathematica, for instance. The more useful of the Goldberg, et al., formulae is the following: :{}_sY_{l m} (\\\\theta, \\\\phi) = \\\\left(-1\\\\right)^m \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{(l+m)! (l-m)! (2l+1)} {4\\\\pi (l+s)! (l-s)!} } \\\\sin^{2l} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} \\\\right) \\\\times\\\\sum_{r=0}^{l-s} {l-s \\\\choose r} {l+s \\\\choose r+s-m} \\\\left(-1\\\\right)^{l-r-s} e^{i m \\\\phi} \\\\cot^{2r+s-m} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\theta} {2} \\\\right)\\\\, . A Mathematica notebook using this formula to calculate arbitrary spin-weighted spherical harmonics can be found here. With the phase convention here: :\\\\begin{align} {}_s\\\\bar Y_{l m} &= \\\\left(-1\\\\right)^{s+m}{}_{-s}Y_{l(-m)}\\\\\\\\\\\\ {}_sY_{l m}(\\\\pi-\\\\theta,\\\\phi+\\\\pi) &= \\\\left(-1\\\\right)^l {}_{-s}Y_{l m}(\\\\theta,\\\\phi). \\\\end{align}  First few spin- weighted spherical harmonics  Analytic expressions for the first few orthonormalized spin-weighted spherical harmonics:  Spin-weight , degree  :\\\\begin{align} {}_1 Y_{10}(\\\\theta,\\\\phi) &= \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{3}{8\\\\pi}}\\\\,\\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\\\\\\\\\ {}_1 Y_{1\\\\pm 1}(\\\\theta,\\\\phi) &= -\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{3}{16\\\\pi}}(1 \\\\mp \\\\cos\\\\theta)\\\\,e^{\\\\pm i\\\\phi} \\\\end{align}  Relation to Wigner rotation matrices  :D^l_{-m s}(\\\\phi,\\\\theta,-\\\\psi) =\\\\left(-1\\\\right)^m \\\\sqrt\\\\frac{4\\\\pi}{2l+1} {}_sY_{l m}(\\\\theta,\\\\phi) e^{is\\\\psi} This relation allows the spin harmonics to be calculated using recursion relations for the -matrices.

The fortification was named after General Charles Garrison Harker, who was killed in action at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain in the American Civil War. Fort Harker replaced Fort Ellsworth, which had been located from the location of Fort Harker and was abandoned after the new fortifications at Fort Harker were constructed. Fort Harker was a major distribution point for all military points farther west and was one of the most important military stations west of the Missouri River. History Fort Ellsworth (see Fort Ellsworth (Kansas))was established in August, 1864 at the junction of the Fort Riley- Fort Larned Road and the Smoky Hill Trail, near the Smoky Hill River. Fort Ellsworth was established as the command headquarters for the District of the Upper Arkansas. Soldiers at the fort patrolled the overland trails to protect wagon trains from any resistance from the Native American tribes in the area. The fort also served an important role in distributing supplies to other United States Army outposts further west. Fort Ellsworth connected supply lines from Fort Leavenworth and Fort Riley to the east with Fort Zarah, Fort Larned, Fort Dodge (see Fort Dodge (US Army Post)), Fort Hays, and Fort Wallace to the west.Guerns, J. (2002). \\"Welcome to Fort Harker\\". Retrieved August 10, 2006. After two years of rapid growth, the fort was badly in need of better facilities and more space. Construction General Winfield S. Hancock Military orders for the construction of a new fort to replace Fort Ellsworth were issued by General Winfield S. Hancock, commander of the Division of the Missouri, on November 17, 1866. The new fort would be located approximately northeast of Fort Ellsworth. Construction may have begun before the official order, as Fort Ellsworth had a master carpenter, a master mason, five carpenters, and fourteen masons on staff as early as September, 1866. Based on the number of civilian contractors on the fort's payroll, major construction of the facility was likely completed by the summer of 1867. In June 1867, the remainder of the buildings at old Fort Ellsworth were ordered torn down.Mix, Larry and Mix, Carolyn (2006). \\"Fort Harker\\". Santa Fe Trail Research Site. St. John, Kansas. Fort Ellsworth was sold to land developers and became the town of Ellsworth, Kansas. Soon after the completion of major construction, the railroad arrived at Fort Harker. The Union Pacific Eastern Division completed a line to Fort Harker in July 1867. The rail line ran through the fort, and a depot was established just outside the fort. Two large warehouses were built next to the line, which became the principal resupply route for the fort. By the end of 1867, the fort supported a four-company garrison, the supply depot and over 75 buildings. Cholera epidemic of 1867 In the summer of 1867, an Asiatic cholera outbreak began amongst the soldiers of the four companies of the 38th Infantry stationed at the fort. The disease may have arrived with the 38th, who traveled to the fort from St. Louis, Missouri, where a cholera outbreak was also occurring. The first case of cholera at the fort was diagnosed on June 28. Within days, one civilian and one soldier had died from the disease, and the epidemic had spread to other soldiers and civilians at the fort, as well as settlers in the surrounding area. The Post Quarter Master reported that 58 citizens were buried during the month of June. The epidemic continued through the remainder of 1867, and by the end of the year the official report tabulated 392 cases with 24 deaths among the white troops and 500 cases with 22 deaths among the black troops stationed at or near the fort. Indian War campaigns Although no battles were ever fought at the fort itself, troops stationed at Fort Harker were involved in the ongoing Indian Wars between the United States Army and the natives of the Great Plains. The troops stationed at Fort Harker in 1867 performed more escorts of wagon trains in one year than troops stationed at any other frontier fort in the post-Civil War era. Once the railroad arrived at the fort in 1867, the need for escort patrols began to shift to the west, and by 1868 the primary role of Fort Harker was changing to that of a supply depot and troop staging site. General Philip Henry Sheridan In the fall of 1868, General Philip Henry Sheridan moved his command headquarters from Fort Leavenworth to Fort Harker, from where he commanded the campaigns against the Native Americans in the winter of 1868/1869. On August 25, 1869, Brevet Colonel Joseph G. Tilford was sent to Fort Harker, where he commanded two troops of General George Armstrong Custer's 7th Cavalry. After wintering at the fort, Tilford and the cavalry set out on a campaign in February 1870. In May 1870, General Custer and the remaining troops of the 7th Cavalry passed through Fort Harker on their way from Fort Leavenworth to Fort Hays to engage the Native Americans further west. Closing By 1871, Fort Harker had declined in importance in the Indian Wars. Native Americans living in the area of the fort had been displaced by white settlers, and the scene of conflicts had shifted to the west. An expanding railroad network diminished the importance of the fort as a distribution point for supplies. In March 1872, the 15th Infantry stationed at Fort Harker redeployed to Fort Union. On April 5, the remaining companies of the 5th Infantry departed from the fort as well. Official orders to abandon Fort Harker were received on April 8, 1872. Soldiers of the 5th Cavalry left Fort Harker on May 7, leaving behind a small garrison of two officers and five enlisted men from the 5th Infantry. The base was completely abandoned by October 5, 1872. Geography Fort Harker was located at the site of the present-day town of Kanopolis. Fort Harker Museum The Ellsworth County Historical Society maintains three of the original buildings of Fort Harker as a museum commemorating both Fort Ellsworth and Harker. These include the guardhouse, Commanding Officer's Quarters, and Junior Officer's Quarters. The museum also features a train depot with salt mine and later 19th/early 20th Century exhibits.Smith, Mary (2005). \\"Welcome to Ellsworth County Museums\\" . Retrieved August 10, 2006.

Until 2005, it was a branch of the National Museum of Krak√≥w. History Feliks Jasie≈Ñski aka \\"Manggha\\", the founder of the collection (Portrait by Leon Wycz√≥≈Çkowski, 1911) In 1920, Feliks Jasie≈Ñski‚Äîcritic, writer and collector of art, whose penname was \\"Manggha\\"‚Äîdonated his collection of artworks connected with Japan to the National Museum in Krak√≥w. After his death, the collection was not exhibited, one reason being the lack of space to arrange the 6500 items. The lone exception was an exhibition in Cloth Hall of Krak√≥w in 1944, organised by the Germans, who occupied Poland at the time. A young Andrzej Wajda saw the exhibition and became fascinated by Japanese art. In 1987, almost half a century later, Andrzej Wajda received a film award in Kyoto. He decided to donate the entire sum to the National Museum in Krak√≥w to build a brand new building in which to exhibit the entire collection. Andrzej Wajda was supported by local authorities, the city, and the government of Japan with special help from ambassador Nagao Hyodo. The East Japan Railway Workers' Union with president Akira Matsuzaki donated the equivalent of approximately $1MM U.S. to the Kyoto-Krak√≥w Foundation created by Andrzej Wajda and friends. View of the lobby The museum seen from Wawel The building was designed by the Pritzker Prize-winning Japanese architect Arata Isozaki, who donated the design to the foundation. Krzysztof Ingarden, J.Ewy and JET Atelier were collaborating architects on the Polish side. Manggha was opened on November 30, 1994. In 1997, Manggha received a Special Award of the Japanese Foundation. On July 11, 2002, the museum was visited by Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko. On the request of the emperor, an exhibition of selected woodcuts of the great Japanese artist Utagawa Hiroshige had been prepared. The imperial couple donated some audio-visual equipment to the centre's school of Japanese language. In a 2006 architectural competition, the centre was chosen as one of twenty most interesting examples of architecture in Poland built after 1989. - \\"Polska. Ikony architektury\\" (\\"Poland.

The highway extends from Main Street (Route 166 and CR 549) in Toms River Township to Pompton Avenue (Route 23) in Cedar Grove. It passes through more counties (six) than any other county route in New Jersey. CR 527 is also the second longest 500-series county route in New Jersey after Route 519. It was first given the number 527 in 1954. CR 527 passes through Ocean, Monmouth, Middlesex, Somerset, Union, and Essex counties on the eastern side of the state. It has two concurrencies with Route 18 in Middlesex County in addition to other minor state highways and county roads. Interchanges with the Garden State Parkway and Interstates 195, 95 (New Jersey Turnpike), 287, 78, and 280 are found along CR 527.

Eugenio Fernandi was born in Pisa and raised in Valperga, metropolitan city of Turin, where he began his vocal studies with Aureliano Pertile. He later entered the opera school at La Scala in Milan, and began appearing there in small roles. His first major role was as Giovanni Battista in Virgilio Mortari's La figlia di diavolo in 1954, followed by the Duke in Rigoletto and Pinkerton in Madama Butterfly. He also sang with success at La Fenice in Venice, the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino in Florence, and the Teatro San Carlo in Naples. In 1957, he made his debut at the Vienna State Opera as Cavaradossi in Tosca, later singing Alfredo Germont, Rodolfo, Riccardo, and Radames. He appeared as Don Carlos at the Salzburg Festival, in 1958 and 1960. He joined the Metropolitan Opera as a leading tenor on February 19, 1958, debuting there as Pinkerton. Of that performance, a March 3, 1958, Time magazine review noted that Fernandi \\"belted out thundering, on-target salvos of sound that rocked the house,\\" further praising that \\"physically and vocally it is surely the handsomest Butterfly ever mounted on a U.S. stage.\\" From 1958 to 1971, Fernandi sang eight seasons with the Met in thirteen roles, including Mario Cavaradossi, Edgardo, Enzo, Ismaele, Arrigo, etc. His opera recording career was limited to the 1957 EMI recording of Turandot, opposite Maria Callas and Dame Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, conducted by Tullio Serafin. He also recorded the tenor part in Verdi's \\"Requiem\\" in the 1959 (EMI) set conducted by Maestro Serafin.\\"Choral Music on Record,\\" edited by Alan Blyth, Cambridge University Press, 1991. This book lists the record number for this set as EMI SXDW 3055.

He served as Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands between 1659 and 1664. Raised in a noble Spanish family, he made a career in the army during the many battles in Italy and Flanders between 1629 and 1659. He conquered the fortress of Casale Monferrato in 1652. He was Governor of Milan between 1648 and 1656. After the defeat of John of Austria the Younger in the Battle of the Dunes (1658), Caracena was appointed to succeed him. After the conclusion of the Treaty of the Pyrenees, the Habsburg Netherlands saw a period of relative peace. Despite this fact, governing wasn't easy for Caracena, since by then various wars had pushed Spain to the brink of bankruptcy. In 1664 he returned to Spain to assume command of the war against Portugal, which was going poorly after a series of military setbacks, most recently after the defeat in 1663 in the Battle of Ameixial, near Estremoz of the same John of Austria the Younger. Caracena's command of the Spanish forces in Portugal was brief; he was decisively defeated by Ant√≥nio Lu√≠s de Meneses at the Battle of Montes Claros in 1665. The defeat effectively ended the War of Restoration in favor of the Portuguese. After the battle, Caracena was charged with treason and cowardice. He defended himself by claiming that he was not to blame, but rather the defeat was due to the poor state of the Spanish army, intrigue in the Spanish Court, and the lack of funds to protract a war against Portugal. Afterwards, he was disregarded by the Spanish Crown and died of disease in 1668.

Mayo, commemorating an actual walk of starving Irish peasants in 1848. The walk attracted the attention of ABC, NBC and CBS News during its first three years, 1988‚Äì90. The walk continues as an annual event. As part of the project Mullan established several connections with the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma and was made an Honorary Chief. The Great Famine Project was multi-disciplined and involved publications, documentaries, dramas and commemorative events including the marking of forgotten mass Famine graves containing the sacred remains of thousands of Irish victims. St. Brigid's Peace Cross and St. Brigid's Fire With five young boys from Derry, Mullan founded in 1983 the St. Brigid's Peace Cross and was instrumental in having St. Brigid's Fire in Kildare permanently rekindled on 1 February 2006. The fire had burned in Kildare for over a thousand years before it was extinguished during the Protestant Reformation. Humanitarian work Mullan worked for the humanitarian agency Concern Worldwide from 1994 until 1996, during which he visited Rwanda and the refugee camps in Zaire. He also worked in Brazil, from 1983 to 1984, during which he organised famine relief to the north-east of the country. Mullan was detained at Johannesburg and refused entry into apartheid South Africa in 1985. In 1994 he attended the inauguration of President Nelson Mandela as the guest of Archbishop Desmond Tutu in recognition of his work on behalf of the anti-apartheid movement. Mullan was invited by Archbishop Tutu to attend a symposium on Robben Island in May 1994, the week following the inauguration of President Mandela. The symposium addressed the future use of Robben Island in a new South Africa and Mullan was invited to address the gathering concerning his own work on harnessing the memory of the Great Irish 'Famine' (1845‚Äì1849) in fighting injustice and oppression today. Concern Universal ‚Äì Children in Crossfire In 1996, the late Allo Donnelly, then Chairman of Concern Universal, a UK- based World Development charity wishing to expand into Ireland, approached Mullan and asked him to head up the operation. By then Mullan had begun his career in investigative journalism and declined the offer. However, he strongly recommended a Derry-based friend, Richard Moore, for the position. Moore had participated in Mullan's re-enactment of the Choctaw Nations 'Trail of Tears' charity walk from Oklahoma to Mississippi in 1992, during which Mullan spoke to him extensively about his humanitarian work with AFrI. During his meeting with Allo Donnelly, Mullan recalled Moore's expressed desire to do similar work. Moore was interviewed for the position and subsequently employed by Concern Universal, setting up the Irish section of the charity as 'Children in Crossfire', named after a BBC documentary of the same name that had featured Moore in 1974. In 2006 'Children in Crossfire' separated from Concern Universal and is now an independent Development Agency in Ireland. Dyslexia Mullan was diagnosed with dyslexia in 1994, and is a member of the International Dyslexia Association. He has authored and edited several books and documentaries and acted as co-producer and associate producer in three award-winning movies Bloody Sunday Omagh, and Five Minutes of Heaven. In April 2004 he was keynote speaker at an International Symposium on dyslexia in Dublin. Bloody Sunday At the age of 15, Mullan witnessed the events of Bloody Sunday in Derry. He was participating in his first Civil Rights March. His 1997 best-selling book Eyewitness Bloody Sunday is officially recognised as an important catalyst that led to Prime Minister Tony Blair's decision in 1998 to establish a new Bloody Sunday Inquiry. The Inquiry opened on 27 March 2000. It was the longest and most expensive Inquiry in British legal history. The results were published on 15 June 2010. British Prime Minister David Cameron addressed the House of Commons that afternoon where he acknowledged, among other things, that the paratroopers had fired the first shot, had fired on fleeing unarmed civilians, and shot and killed one man who was already wounded. He then apologised on behalf of the British Government. Mullan was co-producer, source writer, and actor in the 2002 award-winning Granada/Hell's Kitchen movie Bloody Sunday, directed by Paul Greengrass, which was inspired by his book. Public Speaking As a public speaker Mullan has addressed audiences throughout Ireland, Britain, Europe, Canada, Brazil, and the United States on justice, peace and human rights issues. Amongst the colleges and universities which Mullan has spoken at are: Harvard University, Massachusetts (2004), Villanova University, Pennsylvania (2004), Georgetown University, Washington, DC (2003), Seattle University, Washington (2002) and Notre Dame University, Indiana (2001). In 1986 the Irish American Cultural Organisation described his lecture tour on the Great Hunger as \\"one of the most successful in recent years.\\" Gordon Banks In 2006, Mullan published a boyhood memoir entitled 'Gordon Banks ‚Äì A Hero Who Could Fly' in which he outlines the extraordinary influence for good that Gordon Banks, the 1966 England World Cup winning goalkeeper, had on his life. Gordon Banks travelled to Ireland to launch the book. Consequently, Mullan and Banks became close friends. Through Banks' Stoke City FC colleague, Terry Conroy, Mullan was introduced to sculptor Andrew Edwards. Edwards, Carl Payne and Julian Jeffery created the triple statue honouring the Stoke City and England legendary winger, Sir Stanley Matthews. Mullan travelled all over England in a quest to find a sculptor to help him create the first monument in the Western World to a goalkeeper. This included viewing several of the sporting monuments of Sir Philip Jackson. None moved him like the Matthews monument. Mullan created the Gordon Banks Monument Committee who commissioned Edwards to do a triple statue of Banks. Of Edwards Mullan said, \\"He is a genius. He has the ability to breathe life into bronze. He's an unrecognised national treasure and through the Banks monument ‚Äì I hope to change that!\\" Mullan was successful in getting the iconic Brazilian soccer star, Pel√©, and his longstanding friend, Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, to agree to unveil the first phase of the monument at the Britannia Stadium on 12 July 2008. The unveiling also included a Gordon Banks XI vs. Pel√© XI celebrity charity football match, with Tutu acting as assistant manager to Pel√©. The game celebrated the choice of South Africa and Brazil for the 2010 and 2014 World Cups. Awards He has received Honorary Degrees from Iona College, New Rochelle, New York (1997) Mount Aloysius College, Cresson, Pennsylvania (2001) and DePaul University, Chicago, Illinois (2011). In March 1998, he was Grand Marshal of the San Diego St. Patrick's Day Parade. On 9 December 2002, Mullan received A Defender of Human Dignity Award from the International League for Human Rights at the United Nations, New York. In October 2003 he received from the Ancient Order of Hibernians of America the Sean MacBride Humanitarian Award. In May 1990, Mullan was made an Honorary Chief of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, an honour he shares with the former President of Ireland, Mary Robinson. In 2011, he received an honorary doctorate from DePaul University in Chicago. Mullan has been published in The Irish Times, the Irish Independent, Ireland on Sunday, the Sunday Tribune, The Examiner, Magill Magazine, la Repubblica, The Times (London), The Guardian, Journal do Brasil and Irish America.

The highway extends from Union Avenue (Route 28) in Bound Brook to Main Street (CR 510) in Mendham Borough. CR 525 begins with a couple of turns through Chimney Rock and Martinsville. From Interstate 78 to the northern terminus, CR 525 is mostly a two lane undivided road with some sections multilaned. From Interstate 287 to the northern terminus, CR 525 has a solid northwest alignment.  Route description  View south along CR 525 at Young Road in Bernardsville CR 525 begins at Route 28 in Bound Brook, located northwest of New Brunswick in Somerset County. CR 525 begins as Thompson Avenue, approaching the village of Chimney Rock. In Chimney Rock, CR 525 meets U.S. Route 22, currently divided into two carriageways. North of US 22, CR 525 continues its northern course through Chimney Rock and has a couple of wide turns. CR 525 enters Martinsville from the south as Chimney Rock Road. In Martinsville, CR 525 turns west on to Washington Valley Road before turning north onto Mount Horeb Road. Upon exiting Martinsville, CR 525 becomes Liberty Corner Road. Now in Bernards Township, CR 525 intersects Interstate 78 at exit 33. Briefly north of I-78, CR 525 is named Martinsville Road upon entering Liberty Corner. In Liberty Corner, CR 525 intersects County Route 512 while becoming Mount Airy Road. North of Liberty Corner, CR 525 changes its alignment to a northwest course while meeting with Interstate 287 at exit 26. Then, CR 525 changes to a more northerly alignment. In Bernardsville, CR 525 intersects U.S. Route 202. CR 525 briefly forms a concurry with Route 202 before becoming Claremont Road north of Route 202.

It uses two sub-queues. During the scan, all of the requests are in the first queue and all new requests are put into the second queue. Thus, service of new requests is deferred until all of the old requests have been processed. When the scan ends, the arm is taken to the first queue entries and is started all over again. Analysis FSCAN along with N-Step-SCAN prevents \\"arm stickiness\\" unlike SSTF, SCAN, and C-SCAN. Arm stickiness in those other algorithms occurs when a stream of requests for the same track causes the disk arm to stop progressing at that track, preferring to satisfy the no-seek requests for the track it is on. Because FSCAN separates requests into two queues, with new requests going into a waiting queue, the arm continues its sweep to the outer track and is therefore not \\"sticky.\\" There is an obvious trade-off in that the requests in the waiting queue must wait longer to be fulfilled, but in exchange FSCAN is more fair to all requests. Variations There can be multiple variations of this algorithm. Instead of using just 2 Queue, one can use N Queue. The benefit of using N Queue is there would be limited number of entries in a given Queue and hence the reference string queue would take lesser time to get completed. Hence, the Queues will get swiped faster which in turn improves the responding time of algorithm. (Refer to See Also section).

Main characters=Arnold Shortman Contrary to popular belief, Arnold does not wear a kilt but instead dons a plaid shirt that hangs out of his teal sweater and a hat that only covers a small part of his football-shaped head. Arnold Phillip Shortman (voiced by J.D. Daniels in the pilot, Toran Caudell in season 1, Phillip Van Dyke in seasons 2‚Äì3, Spencer Klein in season 4, 17 out of 20 episodes in season 5, and Hey Arnold! The Movie, Rusty Flood as young Arnold in S4E16, Alex D. Linz 3 out of 20 episodes from season 5, \\"April Fools Day\\" and \\"The Journal\\", and Mason Vale Cotton in Hey Arnold! The Jungle Movie) is the title character of the series. He is a 9-year-old dreamer and an idealist who always tries to see the best in people and do the right thing. His parents, Miles and Stella, left to go to San Lorenzo when he was almost 2 years old but never came back to Hillwood. Whenever he sees someone in trouble, especially Helga, Arnold goes out of his way to help them out, even if it's not sensible to do so. Arnold often acts as the stable center to those around him, whether he's around his \\"family\\" in his paternal grandparents' boarding house, or around his friends at school. He lives in Sunset Arms boarding house with his grandparents, Phil and Gertrude. Arnold has had two major crushes in the series; one on sixth-grader Ruth McDougal (through most of season 1) and one on a classmate named Lila Sawyer (from season 3-5). However, his most catalytic relationship is with his classmate and frenemy Helga Pataki. Helga is secretly in love with him, though to keep these feelings secret she bullies Arnold. Arnold is completely unaware of this fact for most of the series, other than the occasional hint from Helga and other classmates. Helga revealed her secret to Arnold during Hey Arnold! The Movie, but Arnold gave Helga the opportunity to take back her confession, attributing it to \\"the heat of the moment\\". In the made-for-TV sequel Hey Arnold! The Jungle Movie, Arnold returns Helga's feelings with a kiss of his own, after thanking Helga for her help in finding his parents and using her locket to help activate the device that releases the cure to the sleeping sickness which his parents had contracted before they could release the cure. It's also implied at the end of the movie that he and Helga become a couple, as Arnold holds hands with Helga (although Helga pretends to be hostile to Arnold at once in public). Arnold is friends with most of his fellow fourth- graders, with his best friend being Gerald Johanssen, whose friendship dates as far back as preschool. Arnold's surname is never revealed on the show, and the mystery surrounding his full name became a running gag on the show. In several episodes, characters would come close to revealing his last name, only to be cut off for various reasons (e.g. being interrupted, being drowned out, being unable to read it due to poor handwriting, etc.). Craig Bartlett eventually revealed that his full name is \\"Arnold Phillip Shortman\\", which is confirmed in The Jungle Movie. The long-standing running gag of Grandpa Phil calling him \\"Short Man\\" was apparently meant to foreshadow this fact.https://www.buzzfeed.com/keelyflaherty/all-of-your-hey-arnold-questions- have-been-answered Gerald Johanssen Gerald Martin Johanssen (voiced by Jamil Walker Smith throughout the original series and Hey Arnold! The Movie, and Benjamin Flores Jr. in Hey Arnold! The Jungle Movie) is a 9-10 year old African-American boy and Arnold's best friend. He is an athletic and street- smart boy who is portrayed as loyal, though much less responsible than Arnold. Gerald has known Arnold for many years, most likely since preschool. Besides being Arnold's friend, Gerald also has a good deal of knowledge of many legendary stories in the city, or \\"urban legends\\" as he calls them. He apparently gets these myths from a source he has nicknamed \\"Fuzzy Slippers\\", mentioned in many episodes as his reliable assistant. At school, Gerald is the class president, and considers himself very cool, and apparently, so do his friends. When it was revealed that Arnold was on Rhonda's so-called \\"Cool List\\", and that Gerald was on her other list known as \\"The Geek List\\" (due to a grudge Rhonda had against him over running for class president), many classmates were surprised to find this out (\\"Cool Party\\"). His most distinct features are his tall, Kid 'n Play-style hair, and his shirt with the number 33 on it (he also wears 33 on sports uniforms). He has a crush on Phoebe, who shares the same feelings for him. It's implied that at the end of Hey Arnold!: The Jungle Movie that the two have become a couple as they are seen holding hands. Helga Pataki Helga Pataki in her signature pink and red dress and pink bow. Helga Geraldine Patakihttps://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/globr/iam_francesca_marie_smith_and_i_was_the_voice_of/c1ogmdm/ (voiced by Francesca Marie Smith) is a 9-10 year old rough and cynical tsundere girl who puts on a mean, rude, deceitful, tomboyish front. She is often portrayed as the local bully and recurring antagonist of the series, which was Arnold's arch-rival yet love interest. She constantly bullies Arnold and other people, but yet loves him, which is obsessive to the point where she has made many shrines dedicated to him. She is an academically-gifted student and a talented writer of poetry for her age. She despises Arnold because he is a good influence and his football-head is different from most others. She becomes the villain in some episodes and occasionally expresses interest in pursuing the latter as a career. The reason of this is because she is neglected by her parents and often disrespectfully calls them by their first names because she does not think they are worthy of being called \\"Mom\\" and \\"Dad\\". Her mother, Miriam, is usually depressed, forgetful, struggling to stay conscious, and frequently drinking \\"smoothies\\" and \\"coffee\\". Helga relates very poorly to her. Her father, Bob, a successful pager salesman, who suffers from workaholism, rarely notices her existence, favoring her over-achieving, neurotic college-aged sister Olga, who Helga rarely gets along with. He never listens to Helga. Helga is also known for her catchword, \\"criminy!\\", which she normally exclaims when stressed. Helga resents her older sister Olga, a perfectionist in her young adulthood. Although Helga will do her best to avoid unnecessary contact with Olga, she has shown feelings of love for her sister from time to time, as in the episode \\"Olga Gets Engaged\\", when she intervenes on Olga's behalf, saving her from what would have been a bad marriage, and \\"Big Sis\\" when she reveals her jealousy of Olga's relationship with Lila. In the episode \\"Quality Time\\" it's revealed that she hates corn and is allergic to strawberries because they give her hives. In The Jungle Movie, she is shown to have an extensive video library of Arnold which she and Phoebe convince Gerald to use for the contest for the class field trip that Arnold hoped to win to search for his parents, which proves successful. During the trip, Helga attempts to express her true feelings to Arnold who was not in the right frame of mind to hear it at the time and left abruptly leaving Helga heartbroken to the point she ripped up the picture of Arnold in her locket which she discards along with the fragments in the river. She briefly becomes angry at Arnold though after the class is captured by Lasombra and she sees Arnold crying while looking at a picture of his parents she forgives him and reaches for her locket only for her to remember she discarded it but finds that it and Arnold's torn picture was recovered and repaired by Brainy. She convinces Gerald in helping her free Arnold so they could reach the Green Eyes before Lasombra got there first. Together with Arnold and Gerald, they manage to find the Green Eyes. Helga also comes up with the idea to use her locket to replace the Corazon which was lost while they were struggling with Lasombra, which activates the mechanism to release the cure to the sleeping sickness curing the afflicted Green Eyes and Arnold's parents. While she was attempting to retrieve her locket Arnold thanked her for all she did and returns her feelings, resulting in them kissing, only to be interrupted by Gerald. At the end of the movie while it is implied that she and Arnold are now a couple, she reverted to her old ways when Arnold tried to hold her hand on the way to school with Gerald and Phoebe but secretly liked that Arnold made that attempt, and Arnold, now knowing how she thinks, is content to go along with it; she is only feigning hostility towards him in public to maintain her tough girl reputation. Series creator Craig Bartlett revealed in a 2018 interview that Helga's appearance was inspired in part by a young Frida Kahlo. Supporting characters *Phoebe Heyerdahl (voiced by Anndi McAfee) ‚Äì The smartest girl in Arnold's class. She's Helga's 9-10 year old best friend and confidante, though Helga tends to boss her around. Nevertheless, Phoebe acts sometimes as Helga's moral compass, advising her on what she should do. Her ethnicity is half-Japanese on her father's side and her mother is white. She is from Kentucky. Being the smartest girl in her class is very important for her, and she tries her hardest to be that way. Throughout the series, both she and Gerald have a love interest in one another, with Gerald implying a crush on her during Rhonda's party in the episode \\"Hey Harold\\". In Hey Arnold!: The Jungle Movie, Phoebe kisses Gerald and are both seen holding hands at the movie's end, having finally admitted their feelings for one another. *Harold Berman (voiced by Justin Shenkarow) ‚Äì A Jewish American friend of Arnold. Although portrayed as the school bully during the first season, he became more of a companion to Arnold and the other kids later on as his antagonistic role increasingly shifted over to Wolfgang. Despite his frequent bullying and intimidation of other students, Harold's bullying never involves stealing lunch money and he's often revealed to be rather cowardly and usually cries for his mother whenever he gets scared or upset. He's sometimes referred to by the derisive nickname \\"fat boy\\", usually by Helga. He is overweight and in later episodes it's revealed that Harold has a soft spot. His best friends are Sid and Stinky. *Stinky Peterson (sometimes spelled Petersen) (voiced by Christopher Walberg in the series, Jet Jurgensmeyer in The Jungle Movie) ‚Äì Stinky is a tall and lanky friend of Arnold's whose family is from Arkansas, and he is also one of Harold's best friends. Stinky has a Southern accent and a love for lemon pudding. His friendship with Harold had him originally portrayed in the first season as a bully who wore spiked wristbands and sidekick of Harold's, though the former was later de-emphasized and he was reinvented as a more affectionate, mild mannered and romantic character viewed as the class \\"ladies man\\", as he's romantically attracted to several female characters. He's shown to make up excellent poems while Phoebe was feeling depressed. *Sid (voiced by Sam Gifaldi in most episodes, Taylor Gifaldi in \\"April Fool's Day\\", and Aiden Lewandowski in The Jungle Movie) ‚Äì A 9-10 year old friend of Arnold and one of Harold's best friends with paranoid tendencies. He is always shown wearing a green baseball cap backwards, a black leather jacket, jeans and a pair of white Beatle boots. He often tells urban legends, with or without the assistance of Gerald. Perhaps his most well-known characteristic is that he typically ends up in ridiculous situations, such as becoming severely mysophobic, deciding to devote his life to Arnold after Arnold saves his life, and believing Stinky is a vampire, among other things. *Rhonda Wellington Lloyd (voiced by Olivia Hack) ‚Äì A 9-10 year old rich, pompous, self-proclaimed fashion queen and friend of Arnold. She is one of the most popular students attending P.S. 118. Both of her parents are stereotypically preppy. Even though she is always seen concerned about her style, Rhonda is a phenomenal athlete, practicing numerous contact sports, like baseball and football, not caring if she ruins her clothes or accessories. *Eugene Horowitz (voiced by Christopher Castile, then Jarrett Lennon in season 1, then Benjamin Diskin for seasons 2‚Äì4, Blake McIver Ewing in season 5 and the movie and Gavin Lewis in The Jungle Movie) ‚Äì A somewhat socially inept but optimistic friend of Arnold, the class jinx. Eugene is prone to several forms of misfortune and is often bullied. He believes Arnold is a jinx due to several of his past tragedies having occurred in Arnold's presence. It's implied that he has a crush on Sheena. *Lila Sawyer (voiced by Ashley Buccille) ‚Äì A 9-10 year old nice girl who came from a fictional farming community she calls \\"Pleasantville\\" and who lives with her father. Her mother is never seen or mentioned. Lila is Arnold's crush. However, she only prefers Arnold as a friend. She had a crush on Arnold's cousin Arnie. She knows that Helga loves Arnold and offered to help Helga become more like her in one episode. She is described by the show's creator as being a foil for Helga, someone who tries to suppress her darker side by acting overtly nice and sweet similarly to how Helga tries to cover her kind, sensitive side with bullying. Sunset Arms boarders * Oskar Kokoshka (voiced by Steve Viksten in the series and theatrical film, Wally Wingert in The Jungle Movie) ‚Äì A lazy, inconsiderate, mooching immigrant from an Eastern European country (in one episode he is referred to as being Czechoslovakian), that remains unemployed through most of the series, until becoming a paperboy. He has a gambling problem, does not do what he promised, is unable to read the English language until getting assistance from Arnold, and is a pathological liar, even taking advantage of Arnold who often tries to help him out. His childish demeanor and whininess often irritate others. Despite all his negative, despicable personality traits, he does love his wife and feels really bad when he thinks he has let somebody down. His voice resembles that of comedian Yakov Smirnoff and he occasionally utters Smirnoff's catchphrases. He shares his name with an Austrian artist. * Suzie Kokoshka (voiced by Mary Scheer) ‚Äì Oscar's hard- working, dedicated, mature, loving and caring wife, who puts up with all of her husband's antics, selfishness, and laziness, though the two occasionally fight. In the episode \\"Baby Oskar\\" she has a cousin named Nancy and a nephew who is also named Oskar and was babysitting him for two days. * Ernie Potts (voiced by Dom Irrera) ‚Äì A short-statured and hot-headed demolitionist who has a Napoleon complex. In the episode \\"Ernie in Love\\" he develops a crush and starts dating a plus-size model named Lola. * Mr. Hyunh (voiced by Baoan Coleman in the original series and also by Wally Wingert in Hey Arnold!: The Jungle Movie) ‚Äì His last name (a misspelling of Hu·ª≥nh) is pronounced \\"win.\\" He is an immigrant from Vietnam, working in a Mexican restaurant. Despite having a heavy Vietnamese accent when speaking, it is revealed that he's very talented at singing country music with the singing voice provided by country singer Randy Travis. He can also play cello, guitar and trumpet quite well. One episode reveals that he has a long lost daughter, Mai, whom he was separated from after he had asked a US soldier to take her out of Vietnam during the Fall of Saigon. They are finally reunited in the Christmas special \\"Arnold's Christmas\\", courtesy of Arnold, Gerald, and Helga. Mai's biological mother is never seen or mentioned, and no explanation is given for her absence. *Mr. Smith ‚Äì A mysterious character who lived in the boarding house. His face is never seen, nor has his voice ever been heard. He is resented by the other boarders due to this secretive lifestyle, as he does not share many of the main boarding house facilities, which are limited, based on the number who live there. He only appears in the first season. *Lana Vail (voiced by Christine Ebersole) ‚Äì A lawyer who resides in the boarding house. She wears a purple suit and has brown hair. She was a minor character to begin with, and has brief appearances throughout the series. She has her only speaking appearance in \\"Heat\\". *Mr. Purdy (voiced by Joseph Purdy) ‚Äì he is only mentioned once in the episode \\"Gerald Comes Over\\" when Arnold collects the rent money. There are suspicions of him sharing his room with a chicken, this from chicken noises as Gerald listens from outside his door, never revealed, but covered up by him. Families=Shortman family * Phillip \\"Phil\\" Shortman (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) ‚Äì Arnold's cheery, fun-loving grandfather. He is 81 years old, as of the episode \\"Grandpa's Birthday\\". Arnold often comes to him for advice. He often tells Arnold stories about his past experiences, although he has a tendency to stretch the truth. Despite responding frivolously to Arnold's problems, he will often provide good wisdom. While his advice isn't usually the most helpful, his heart is always in the right place. He's a World War II veteran and claims to have single- handedly won the Battle of the Bulge by tricking a large troupe of Nazi soldiers into eating numerous cans of spoiled CHAM (a spoof of Spam), thereby poisoning them and creating a hole in the enemy line for the American troops to break through. Arnold does not believe his story at first, but it's later proven when Phil shows him a small monument of him hidden in some bushes in a park in Washington D.C. Phil was also a master at Chinese checkers in his youth, which earned him the nickname \\"Steely Phil\\". He's very healthy and spry for his age, as well as athletic. He has an older twin sister named Mitzi. When he and Mitzi were kids they used to be really close and they owned a Scottish Terrier named Pooter but one day he got out of their backyard and was killed by a milk truck and after that day he and Mitzi stopped speaking to each other for 71 years. * Gertrude \\"Pookie\\" Shortman (voiced by Tress MacNeille) ‚Äì Arnold's wacky but wise grandmother who is often seen doing outlandish things, including dressing up and acting like fictional and historic figures, such as Calamity Jane. She is called \\"Pookie\\" by Grandpa Phil and Gertie by Aunt Mitzi She has a black belt. She and Phil had a similar relationship that Helga and Arnold have when they were Arnold's age (though her pranks were a bit more vicious and extreme). * Miles and Stella Shortman (voiced by Craig Bartlett and Antoinette Stella) ‚Äì Arnold's parents, Miles being Phil and Gertrude's son. They're adventurous and brave, though Miles appears to be clumsy and tends to end up hurt. They met while exploring in San Lorenzo, where they occasionally crossed paths with the Green-Eyed people, a mysterious indigenous tribe. They returned to the city after Arnold's birth, but were called back for \\"a final mission\\" when a friend informed them that the Green Eyes were in trouble; they failed to return, leaving their son under his grandparents' care. Arnold comes across a journal detailing some of their adventures years afterwards. His pet pig, Abner, was a wedding gift to his parents from the Green Eyes. In The Jungle Movie, it is revealed that while trying to cure the adults of the Green Eyes who had caught the sleeping sickness they ran out of medicine and began to work on making more, but unfortunately, they ended up contracting sleeping sickness leaving only the Green Eyes' children to watch over them and the other adults. However, they managed to make enough of the cure and planned to aerosolize it so it could cure everyone using the Green Eyes' technology which was activated by the Corazon, a literal heart made of solid gold which was sought by the villainous river pirate Lasombra who pretends to be Miles and Stella's friend Eduardo to trick him in leading him to the Corazon. However, the Corazon falls down a ravine while Arnold, Helga, Gerald, and the real Eduardo are struggling with Lasombra. Fortunately, Helga gets the idea to use her locket in place of the Corazon which she reveals to Arnold for the first time. It worked and the cure is released curing the Green Eyes and Arnold's parents who return home with their son. * Arnie (voiced by Grant Hoover) ‚Äì Arnold's cousin, who lives in the countryside and strongly resembles Arnold. He likes to collect lint and gum, count things, read the ingredients on the back of food containers, and makes a peculiar snorting sound on occasion. When he visits PS. 118, Lila develops a crush on him and attempts to attract his attention, but he develops a crush on Helga. He's often seen as strange, gross, dull or stupid by those around him. * Mitzi Shortman (voiced by Phyllis Diller) ‚Äì Arnold's great aunt, Phil's twin sister and childhood rival. She is 81 years old. When she and Phil were kids they had a Scottish Terrier named Pooter but then was killed by a milk truck and after that day she and her brother stopped speaking to each other for 71 years. * Grandpa Phil's father (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) ‚Äì He is often seen in Grandpa's flashbacks to the 1920s. * Grandpa Phil's grandfather (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) ‚Äì Having lived from 1830-1921, he is seen in one of Grandpa's flashbacks. Grandpa remembers doing chores one winter while his friends were ice skating, only to be hit with a snowball by his grandfather who gave him permission to stop his chores and play. Pataki family * Robert \\"Big Bob\\" Pataki (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) ‚Äì Olga and Helga's oafish, ambitious entrepreneur father, a successful beeper salesman who owns a beeper store. He has extremely high expectations for Helga and frequently compares her to her older sister Olga. Bob also frequently calls Helga by Olga's name by mistake and is often neglectful to her. However, Bob does care for Helga as is evidenced in subtle ways. Bob has difficulty showing his emotions for Helga since she and he always come into conflict with each other. He often mistakenly calls Arnold \\"Alfred\\". In The Jungle Movie, he still sells beepers despite Helga pointing out that nobody uses beepers anymore due to cellphones and it's implied that his business isn't as successful as it used to be. * Miriam Pataki (voiced by Kath Soucie) ‚Äì Olga and Helga's inattentive mother. It's hinted throughout the show that Miriam suffers from alcoholism, as she often drinks \\"smoothies\\" which sometimes contain ingredients found in alcoholic cocktails such as celery and tabasco sauce, forgets things, speaks in a slow, tired voice, has had her driver's license revoked, has to do community service and sleeps a lot (often in inappropriate places). Like Bob, it is shown in very subtle ways that she cares about Helga, such as checking in her room when she heard a crash. The unaired Hey Arnold! spin-off, The Patakis, would have included her struggle with alcoholism and joining of Alcoholics Anonymous as a plot point. However, in one episode when Bob injures his back and cannot work, Miriam fills in for him. During the episode Miriam sobers up and holds the fort. Miriam also becomes more attentive towards Helga until she becomes a workaholic and realizes that she is ignoring Helga. Then, she quits and makes Bob return to work. However, her sobriety doesn't last long because in episodes following this one, she is back to drinking smoothies. Miriam was a champion bull rider before marrying Bob, and she used to be an Olympic class swimmer. She reveals in the episode \\"Olga Gets Engaged\\" that she regrets marrying Bob, which resulted in throwing her life away and presumably resulting in her insecurities. * Olga Pataki (voiced by Nika Futterman) ‚Äì Helga's intelligent, outgoing, beautiful older sister, who attends the fictional Wellington College, although in one episode, Helga says that Olga attends Bennington College, which is an existing college located in the U.S. state of Vermont. Olga clearly suffers from perfectionism. She possesses skills that demonstrate a high level of intelligence, as in the episode \\"Helga on the Couch\\", where she is shown to be a virtuoso pianist in one of Helga's flashbacks, and when Helga mentions that she was a straight-A student. She attended P.S. 118 as a child, and is praised by Helga's teachers for her achievements. Bob and Miriam consider Olga perfect, which bothers Helga. They sometimes confuse Helga with Olga. Olga gives Helga more attention than their parents and has good intentions, but Helga doesn't receive Olga's attention or intentions very well and often tries to push Olga away and keep her distance. Olga has a tendency to view life through rose-colored glasses and appears not to even notice Helga's avoidance tactics. It's revealed in \\"Helga on the Couch\\" that through the years Olga has reacted to her family's problems by being a perfectionist and keeping quiet about the situations at hand. Therefore, either Olga likes to avoid conflict since she rarely acknowledges her family's problems, is oblivious, or is in denial. She later reveals to Helga that she's envious of her, as unlike Olga, their parents never heaped unrealistic expectations onto Helga, comparing herself to a \\"wind-up doll\\" that performs for their parents-- which would mean that Olga's aforementioned perfectionism was originally pushed upon her by their parents. In The Jungle Movie she is Mr. Simmons's helper with chaperoning his students on a trip to San Lorenzo. When they arrive, she develops a crush on Che, a shipmate who turns out to be working for Lasombra, and is heartbroken when he locks her and the others up in jail. Later in the movie when her parents and Arnold's grandparents come to help them, Olga tells Big Bob that Che was mean to her and started chasing him and beating him up for breaking her heart. Johanssen family * Martin Johanssen (voiced by Rick Fitts) ‚Äì Gerald's sometimes strict father, complains about wasting electricity. He is a Vietnam War veteran. * Mrs. Johanssen (voiced by Shari Belafonte) ‚Äì Gerald's very kind mother, keeps family together. She is a cashier at the neighborhood market. * James \\"Jamie O\\" Johanssen (voiced by Ben Aaron Hoag and Phil LaMarr) ‚Äì Gerald's teenage brother, who bullies him. In the episode \\"Jamie O in Love\\" Arnold and Gerald spy on him to find out why he was being so nice to them and found out that he had a girlfriend named Sharice. One day, after Jamie O dropped them off at a restaurant to eat lunch, they see Sharice and overhear a conversation between her and her friend that she does not really like Jamie O and was gonna milk him for all he is worth. Gerald tells Arnold not to say anything about it to him because they're worried if he told them that he'd stop being nice and would not drive them to an upcoming hockey game. Days later Jamie O is seen doing Sharice's laundry and making her a souffl√©. While juggling to do all those things, Jamie O accidentally burns one of Sharice's cashmere socks and breaks down crying. Feeling conflicted, Gerald decided to tell Jamie O the truth about Sharice and he doesn't believe him until he overheard her talking to her friend that he's a sap, causing Jamie O to realize that Gerald was right, and as a result, Jamie O broke up with her offscreen. The next day, to show that he's sorry for not believing his brother, Jamie O drives Gerald and Arnold to the hockey stadium. * Timberly Johanssen (voiced by Avriel Epps and Francesca Smith) ‚Äì Gerald's little sister. She usually causes trouble due to her desire for attention or naturally childish behaviour. Unlike all the other children on the show, Timberly seems to age throughout the series. In her first appearance, she's four years old, but she already attends the first grade in \\"Timberly Loves Arnold\\", although this may be a continuity error, rather than intentional. Heyerdahl family * Kyo Heyerdahl (voiced by George Takei) ‚Äì Phoebe's Japanese American father. He speaks Japanese fluently. However, his surname is not Japanese, it is Norwegian. * Reba Heyerdahl (voiced by Jean Smart) ‚Äì Phoebe's Southern American mother from Kentucky. Berman family * Jerry Berman (voiced by David Wohl) ‚Äì Harold's father. He has a tendency of talking in a very low pitch, and is more concerned about Harold's obesity than his wife. * Marilyn Berman (voiced by Kath Soucie) ‚Äì Harold's mother. She is more vocal with her scolding of Harold than her husband. Horowitz family *Nate Horowitz (voiced by Michael Jeter) ‚Äì Eugene's father. He is equally unlucky as his son as seen in the episode \\"Fishing Trip\\". *Mrs. Horowitz ‚Äì Eugene's mother (only appears in the episodes \\"Eugene's Birthday\\" and \\"Parents' Day\\" )who, unlike Eugene and her husband who are redheads, is the only member of their family with blonde hair. Lloyd family *Buckley Lloyd (voiced by Sam McMurray) ‚Äì Rhonda's father. Whenever Rhonda gets very upset, he buys her things to cheer her up. *Brooke Lloyd (voiced by Lori Alan) ‚Äì Rhonda's mother who believes her daughter is a perfect angel who can do no wrong. Most episodes she's seen talking on her cellphone. Sawyer family * Mr. Sawyer (voiced by Dan Butler) ‚Äì Lila's father is seen in the episode \\"Ms. Perfect\\". He appears to be a kind and caring father. When Lila is new to P.S. 118 and being bullied by some of her female classmates, her father tries to be there for her. In the episode it is revealed that he had been unemployed and it ends happily with him getting a job. Other characters=Other students of PS 118 * Thaddeus \\"Curly\\" Gammelthorpe (voiced by Adam Wylie in most episodes, Haley Joel Osment in \\"Deconstructing Arnold\\", Steven Hartman in ‚ÄúDowntown as Fruits‚Äù, Michael Welch in \\"Ghost Bride\\" and \\"Curly's Girl\\", and Nicolas Cantu in The Jungle Movie) ‚Äì The class sociopath. He has had meltdowns and outbursts throughout the show such as in the episodes \\"False Alarm\\" and \\"Curly Snaps\\". He also appears to have a major crush on Rhonda. In the episode \\"Curly's Girl\\", Rhonda pretends to be Curly's girlfriend for a week after he cleaned her mother's new mink coat she wore for a school art show, but she is disgusted by his appeal. * Torvald (voiced by Michael Bacall) ‚Äì A fourth grader who was held back for several years due to his poor math performance (to the point of not knowing the answer to 3x3) and is considerably older than the rest of the students. He is tutored by Arnold in one episode. In the episode \\"Tutoring Torvald\\", he is revealed to be 13 years old. He disappears from the series after Season 2. * Sheena Annapotato (voiced by Francesca Marie Smith) ‚Äì A geeky girl who does not like violence. Her aunt Shelly is the school nurse, her uncle Earl rows a boat. It is implied that Sheena has a crush on Eugene Horowitz. * Lorenzo (voiced by Victor Samuel Lopez) ‚Äì A wealthy Hispanic American boy who did not have enough time to be a kid, by his mother's schedule. Arnold and the other kids teach him what it means to be a kid. In the episode \\"Arnold's Room\\" he and Sid are partners for a science project at school after seeing Lorenzo's bedroom, Sid is worried that his bedroom isn't good enough to show Lorenzo so he borrows Arnold's bedroom so they could work together. At the end of the episode when Arnold and the rest of his guy friends came over to play card games Sid knocks on the door and Lorenzo asks him why he is knocking if it is his own room then breaks down crying after explaining why he lied to him. Lorenzo forgave him if he promises never to lie to him again and to show that everything is hunky-dory Arnold invites them both to join him and the others in playing cards. * Iggy (voiced by Justin Shenkarow in \\"Downtown as Fruits\\", Sam Gifaldi in \\"Heat\\", Marcus Toji in \\"Stoop Kid\\" and Joseph Ashton in \\"Arnold Betrays Iggy\\" and \\"Gerald's Game\\") ‚Äì A friend of Arnold's who is considered popular amongst his classmates. During the first season, he was shown as something of a troublemaker who would sometimes co-operate with Harold in mischievous deeds. His shirt tails stick out like Arnold's, creating illusion of a kilt, and he almost always wears dark sunglasses that he rarely takes off. Iggy is infamous for the episode \\"Arnold Betrays Iggy\\", where his classmates find out he wears pink and white bunny pajamas after Sid and Stinky discover it and he blames Arnold for it, angrily rejecting his apologetic actions until Arnold reluctantly subjects himself to a widely publicized humiliation from many of his kid and adult friends by wearing the same bunny pajamas in front of him in public; during this time, Iggy finds out that Sid and Stinky were the true culprits and tries to apologize to Arnold afterwards, but Arnold only gives him an angry look, implying that he is too angry to forgive him. In later episodes however, there is no continuing animosity between the two as Iggy continued to associate with Arnold, implying that Arnold has either eventually forgiven him or the time has passed long enough to be as if it never happened. * Brainy (voiced by Craig Bartlett) ‚Äì A geek and Helga's stalker who is usually knocked unconscious by Helga without Helga looking at him. He seems to be romantically attracted to her. He has a very deep voice, wheezes noisily, and never talks in a completed sentence. He rarely appears except when Helga looks at her locket containing a picture of Arnold. Apparently Brainy hasn't told anybody else about Helga's crush on Arnold. He has the same hairstyle as Bart Simpson from The Simpsons. In The Jungle Movie\\", he continues to stalk Helga though he ends up helping her by retrieving her locket and Arnold's torn up picture which Helga discarded in anger after Arnold had seemingly rejected her, giving the locket and the repaired picture back to Helga after the class had been captured by Lasombra. Having forgiven Arnold, Helga thanked Brainy by kissing him before rushing off much to his surprise and delight. Helga's locket would later play a key role in releasing the cure that cured Arnold's parents and the Green Eyes, which would not have been possible had Brainy not retrieved it for Helga. * Nadine (voiced by Lauren Robinson in the series, Laya Hayes in The Jungle Movie) ‚Äì A young entomologist and Rhonda's best friend. She tends to find a lot of Rhonda's more stuck-up opinions ridiculous. In the episode \\"Dinner for Four\\", she sets cockroaches free in a restaurant as a favour for Helga. This is the only episode where she has a bigger role than Rhonda, for her usual role is Rhonda's satellite character. In \\"Parents Day\\", Nadine is shown to be half black and half white on her mother and father's side respectively. * Park (voiced by Marcus Toji) ‚Äì A close friend of Arnold and others. In the episode \\"Longest Monday\\", it is revealed that he has a secret hideout at the local junkyard. He only speaks in seasons 1‚Äì3. * Joey Stevenson (voiced by Justin Shenkarow in earlier appearances, Michael Fishman in later appearances) ‚Äì An African-American boy who is easy to remember by knowing he is missing a tooth. He appears with Arnold's group of friends from time to time, though his most prominent roles are in the first season, when he was part of Harold's circle of friends, along with Iggy, Stinky, and Sid. * Peapod Kid (voiced by Jamil Walker Smith) ‚Äì A wealthy and well-spoken fourth grade student. In \\"Downtown as Fruits\\" he was unnamed but was credited as \\"Peapod Kid\\" because his costume for the school play was a pea pod. The name stuck and in later episodes he is called Peapod or Peapod Kid by the other children. * \\"Chocolate Boy\\" (voiced by Jordan Warkol) ‚Äì A boy obsessed with chocolate. In \\"Chocolate Boy\\", it is revealed he eats chocolate because his nanny fed him large amounts of chocolate before she left to a \\"far away land called Delaware.\\" Arnold helps break Chocolate Boy of his obsession, but he only becomes as equally over- excessive eating radishes as a replacement. * Wolfgang (voiced by Toran Caudell) ‚Äì The main bully of the block who is a fifth grader and Arnold's arch-enemy. He is more of a bully than Helga, also runs the fifth grade, and leads the other fifth-grade bullies in their troublemaking against younger students. Similar to Arnold, Wolfgang is somewhat popular with many friends in his grade, aside from his mildly dimwitted right-hand man, Edmund. The character, introduced during the second season, was created as a way for Caudell to stay on the show, as he was going through puberty and he could no longer voice Arnold as a result. ** Edmund (voiced by Tim Wiley) ‚Äì Wolfgang's best friend and sidekick. He often asks stupid questions, causing Wolfgang to remark \\"Shut up, Edmund.\\" ** Mickey (voiced by Marty York) ‚Äì A fifth grader who is nicknamed \\"The Weasel\\" as seen in \\"Longest Monday.\\" * Gloria (voiced by Francesca Smith) ‚Äì A girl who looks like Helga, but is more girly and has a nicer personality. Her first appearance is in \\"Magic Show\\" as a dream vision, but she is revealed to be a reality in \\"Helga's Boyfriend\\" when Stinky begins dating her, and appears as an extra in \\"Cool Party\\". * Ludwig (voiced by Phillip Van Dyke) ‚Äì A bully who only appears in the episode \\"New Bully on the Block\\", where after leaving juvenile hall, he, Arnold, and Wolfgang fight each other for control over Gerald Field. But at the end of the episode, Ludwig and Wolfgang become friends and attack Arnold and his friends, leaving them hanging on a football goal post well into the night. He never appeared again afterwards. His name is likely a reference to Ludwig Van Beethoven, a famous classical composer, as a counterpoint to Wolfgang who shares his first name with classical composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and similar to Wolfgang, was created so that there would be an episode featuring Arnold's then-current voice actor (Klein) amongst his previous voice actors (Caudell and Van Dyke). * Ruth P. McDougal (voiced by Lacey Chabert) ‚Äì A sixth-grade girl who was Arnold's first crush. Arnold went on a date with her on Valentine's Day but realized that she was not very nice after he caught her red-handed with the waiter at the restaurant and left with him. In the episode \\"What's Opera Arnold?\\" She played the role of Carmen and Arnold played the role of Don Jos√© from the opera Carmen. But was interrupted by Helga who slingshot Ruth into a trap door on stage in the middle of the kissing scene. * Connie and Maria (voiced by Pamela Hayden and Mayim Bialik) ‚Äì Two sixth-grade girls, Maria is a Latina, who speaks with a Mexican accent, often using Spanish words in discussion. They ask Arnold and Gerald to be their dates in the episode \\" Sixth Grade Girls\\" although just to use them to make their boyfriends jealous, but both agree that they are sweet and have potential to attract their interest in the future, when they are older than fourth graders. The two often appear in later episodes when the sixth grade classroom is shown, either with or without dialogue. In the episode \\"Pheobe Skips\\" They and along with their two other friends Cookie and Symone tricked Pheobe into doing their homework for them while they watched a soap opera. Near at the end of the episode there was a new girl named Shavone who got transferred from the third grade to their sixth grade class. They told Pheobe that they no longer needed her services and planned on making Shavone their new homework girl. * Patricia \\"Big Patty\\" Smith (voiced by Danielle Judovits) ‚Äì An ill-tempered sixth-grade girl who becomes Harold's friend (it is implied that the two may have romantic feelings for each other as well). She dislikes Helga because of her pranks and was a bully like her. In an earlier episode, she plans to fight Helga, but stages it instead. She even asks Helga if she and Arnold had feelings for each other, which Helga denies. In season 4, she becomes friends with Rhonda after they both attend the same finishing school together. She was also held back a couple of years and is 14-years-old. ** Mrs. Smith (voiced by Zelda Rubinstein) ‚Äì Mother of Patty who possess the medical condition of dwarfism. ** Mr. Smith (voiced by Henry Gibson) ‚Äì Father of Patty who also possesses the medical condition of dwarfism. Staff of PS 118 * Superintendent Chaplin (voiced by Jack Angel) ‚Äì An official who supervises schools in the city as seen in \\"Principal Simmons\\". * Principal Wartz (voiced by David Wohl) ‚Äì The strict, yet open-hearted principal of the school.

Southern Russia or the South of Russia (, Yug Rossii) is a colloquial term for the southernmost geographic portion of European Russia, generally covering the Southern Federal District and the North Caucasian Federal District. The term does not conform to any official areas of the Russian Federation as designated by the Russian Classification on Objects of Administrative Division (OKATO). History The Caucasus has been inhabited for millennia. Eastern Slavic tribes, like the Antes, inhabited Southern Russia at least from 3rd century. Southern Russia played an important role in the influence of Byzantine culture on Russia. Persian culture has also left its traces in Southern Russia. At the beginning of the second millennium, between Volga and Don, Turkic tribes established in the South of Russia Tatar states. According to historical sources, the Russian lands in Southern Russia adopted the Islamic faith after contact with the Mongols. During the Russian Civil War (1917‚Äì1922), a territory called South Russia briefly existed from 1919 to 1920, which spanned the southern parts of the Russian Empire, including portions of Ukraine. In Soviet historiography, it also was referred to as \\"White South\\" in reference to the White Army that fought the Bolsheviks there along with the Armed Forces of South Russia and the Volunteer Army.

His academic work has focused on Palestinian, Jordanian, and Israeli nationalism. Massad was born in Jordan in 1963, and is of Palestinian Christian descent. He received his PhD in Political Science from Columbia in 1998. He is known for his book Desiring Arabs, about representations of sexual desire in the Arab world.  Biography  In 1998, Massad received his doctorate in political science from Columbia University, and in the fall of 1999, he started teaching at the university. There, his views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and surrounding topics caused controversy. In 2009, he was awarded tenure at the university. The award was denounced by LionPAC - a pro-Israel advocacy group at Columbia.  Colonial Effects (2001)  Massad's first book, Colonial Effects: The Making of National Identity in Jordan, was published in 2001 by Columbia University Press. The book is based on Massad's PhD dissertation, which won the Middle East Studies Association Malcolm Kerr Dissertation Award in 1998. Over the course of a detailed history of the Jordanian state, from its inception in 1921 to 2000, he argues that state institutions are central to the fashioning of national identity. Massad focuses on institutions of law, the military, and education as key components of nationalism, and elaborates on the production not only of national identity but also of national culture including food, clothes, sports, accents, songs, and television serials. Colonial Effects was critically praised both by several senior academics in Middle East Studies, including Edward Said who described the book as \\"a work of genuine brilliance,\\" and by scholars of nationalism such as Partha Chatterjee, Amr Sabet, and Stephen Howe, the last of whom called the book \\"among the most sophisticated and impressive products\\" of recent studies in the field. The book was extensively reviewed in academic journals and, according to Betty Anderson, one of the book's reviewers, it has become staple reading on syllabi of nationalism and Middle East politics university courses across the United States and Europe.Betty Anderson. \\"The Duality of National Identity in the Middle East: A Critical Review\\" [229-250]. John Chalcraft of the University of Edinburgh described Massad's analysis of the impact of colonial subjection on modern Jordanian nationalism as \\"a major contribution to the literature on Jordanian nationalism, anticolonial nationalism, and the wider field of postcolonial studies;\\" he also criticizes the paucity of information Massad offers on how \\"the mass of the population [who] barely get a mention in Massad's account,\\" fared in this history: He finds that in Massad's account \\"there is an impression that one, white, male, colonial subject is privileged with potency, whereas the agency of others is effaced. For the colonizer, one theory of the subject, for the colonized, another.\\"  The Persistence of the Palestinian Question (2006)  The Persistence of the Palestinian Question: Essays on Zionism and the Palestinians, Massad's second book, was published in 2006 by Routledge. The Persistence of the Palestinian Question analyzes Zionism and Palestinian nationalism from a variety of angles, including race, gender, culture, ethnicity, colonialism, antisemitism, and nationalist ideology. Massad's analysis of the discourse on terrorism in the introduction deals with the dynamics of power relations between Zionism and the Palestinians and traces the history of Zionist and Israeli violence which the British called \\"terrorism\\" in Palestine before 1948 and after, while his title chapter on the persistence of the Palestinian question argues that the Palestinian and the Jewish questions are one and the same and that \\"both questions can only be resolved by the negation of anti-Semitism, which still plagues much of Europe and America and which mobilizes Zionism's own hatred of Jewish Jews and of the Palestinians.\\" The book has received praise from scholars Ilan Papp√© and Ella Shohat as well as from Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi. Shohat praised the book as a \\"timely and engaging volume\\" that \\"makes an invaluable contribution to the ongoing debate over Zionism and Palestine.\\" Papp√© saw the book as a \\"courageous intellectual exercise\\" and as \\"a thought provoking book that forces us to reverse our conventional images and perceptions about Palestine's history and future.\\"Ella Shohat review of The Persistence of the Palestinian Question at Amazon.com Other scholars situated the book's contribution in relation to European history and to the work of Edward Said. University of Pennsylvania political science professor Anne Norton wrote: > Massad's brilliant and scholarly work is profoundly illuminating not only > for the history of Palestine and the discourses surrounding it, but for the > history of Europe and the United States and, finally, as an account that > raises compelling theoretical questions. In his review in Nations and Nationalism, Israeli scholar Ephraim Nimni wrote: > like his intellectual mentor, Massad reminds us of a long and honourable > tradition of Jewish Intellectuals who could only envisage the solution to > the Jewish Question through universal emancipation. It seems that Massad, > and the late Edward Said, are existential Diaspora Jews of the old kind ... > The book is also fastidiously referenced, showing the erudition of the > author and his command of the voluminous Israeli and Palestinian literature > as well as the classics of Jewish history.  Desiring Arabs (2007)  Massad's third book, Desiring Arabs, was published in 2007 by the University of Chicago Press. Desiring Arabs won Columbia University's 2008 Lionel Trilling Book Award, awarded by a jury of students on the grounds that it \\"offers a probing study of representations of Arab sexuality\\" and is \\"an important and eloquent work of scholarship that the committee feels will have a lasting impact on the field.\\" Desiring Arabs is an intellectual history of the Arab world and its Western representations in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The book makes contributions to a number of academic and theoretical fields. It extends Said's study of Orientalism by analyzing the latter's impact on Arab intellectual production; it links Orientalism to definitions and representations of sex and desire and in doing so provides a colonial archive to the sexual question that has hitherto been missing; it approaches the literary as the limits of imagining the future; and puts forth the question of translation as a central problem in Euro-American studies of the other. Massad argues that \\"Western male white-dominated\\" gay activists, under the umbrella of what he terms the \\"Gay International,\\" have engaged in a \\"missionary\\" effort to impose the binary categories of heterosexual/homosexual into cultures where no such subjectivities exist, and that these activists in fact ultimately replicate in these cultures the very structures they challenge in their own home countries. Massad writes that > The categories gay and lesbian are not universal at all and can only be > universalized by the epistemic, ethical, and political violence unleashed on > the rest of the world by the very international human rights advocates whose > aim is to defend the very people their intervention is creating.  Reviews  In her review of Desiring Arabs in the Arab Studies Journal, feminist scholar Marnia Lazreg, a professor of sociology at CUNY, wrote, \\"This truly monumental book is a corrective to Michel Foucault's History of Sexuality that inexplicably omitted the role played by the cultural effects of colonial systems on conceptions and constructions of sexuality ... [Desiring Arabs] is an epoch-making book\\".Arab Studies Journal, Vol XV No. 2 /Vol XVI No. 1, 202 Khaled El-Rouayheb of Harvard University called the book, \\"A pioneering work on a very timely yet frustratingly neglected topic. ... I know of no other study that can even begin to compare with the detail and scope of [this] work.\\" Samia Mehrez, a professor of Arabic Literature at the American University in Cairo writes in the Journal of Gender Studies:Journal of Gender Studies, Vol. 18, No. 1, March 2009, 77-79 > Desiring Arabs by Joseph Massad is an impressive project that ventures into > uncharted territory and can be read as a complement to both Edward Said's > Orientalism and Michel Foucault's work on sexuality. Like all of Massad's > work, Desiring Arabs investigates the discursive and institutional continuum > through which culture is 'invented' under both colonial rule through > colonial practices that sought to reify racial and religious differences as > well as through the cultural politics of the post-colonial nation state and > its efforts to consolidate the nation, national identity, and national > belonging. Ferial Ghazoul in the Journal of Arabic Literature, writes: While there has been a clear consensus on the book's significant scholarly contributions, some of the book's theses have been criticized by Rayyan Al-Shawaf, a freelance writer and reviewer living in Beirut, who concedes that Massad makes a few good points, but observes that \\"Massad's relativism ‚Äì stemming from his accurate observation that 'homosexuality' is alien to Arab same-gender sexual traditions ‚Äì is so extreme that he refuses to support a call for universal freedom of sexual identity.\\" Al-Shawaf argues that, > In postulating the inevitability of (heterosexual) Arab violence wherever > there is gay and lesbian assertiveness, Massad pre-emptively exonerates the > perpetrators ‚Äì whether individuals or the state ‚Äì of any wrongdoing. However > regrettable their behaviour, those Arabs who react violently to the gay > rights campaign are not perceived by Massad as responsible for their > actions, but as caught up in a broader struggle against 'imperialism', to > which the gay rights movement is wedded.  Islam in Liberalism (2015)  Islam in Liberalism is Joseph Massad's fourth book, published by University of Chicago Press in 2015. An article published by the Los Angeles Review of Books states that the thesis of the book is that \\"American and European missionaries of liberalism are trying to proselytize Muslims ‚Äî and the entire world writ large ‚Äî to the only sane system of values that exists on the planet: those of Western liberalism\\". The book deals with the \\"instrumentalization of Islam in the West\\" and responds to critiques of his earlier book Desiring Arabs.  Political views = On antisemitism  Following arguments made by Edward Said in his 1978 book Orientalism, Massad asserts that 19th Century European antisemitic characterizations of Jews have transformed in the present era to target Arabs, while maintaining the same racialist characterizations, and thus, racism towards Arabs and Muslims today is a form of \\"Euro-American Christian anti-Semitism and ... Israeli Jewish anti-Semitism.\\" Massad bases this belief on an understanding of antisemitism as a specific historical phenomenon originating in Europe, rather than simply as hatred of Jews; he writes: \\"the claims made by many nowadays that any manifestation of hatred against Jews in any geographic location on Earth and in any historical period is 'anti-Semitism' smack of a gross misunderstanding of the European history of anti-Semitism\\".  On Israel and Zionism  Massad believes that Israel is a racist Jewish state. He believes that Zionism is not only racist but antisemitic, and antisemitic not only towards Arab Palestinians, but also towards Jews. Massad writes that after Europeans invented the racialist conception of the \\"Semite,\\" the Zionist movement \\"adopted wholesale anti-Semitic ideologies\\", and describes Zionism as an \\"anti-Semitic project of destroying Jewish cultures and languages in the diaspora\\", which has ultimately led to \\"the transformation of the Jew into the anti-Semite, and the Palestinian into the Jew.\\" Massad further accuses Zionists of unjustly \\"appropriating the fruit of the land that Palestinian peasants produced,\\" and specifies the renaming of \\"Palestinian rural salad (now known in New York delis as Israeli salad)\\" as an example of Israeli racism.Joseph Massad, \\"The Persistence of the Palestinian Question,\\" in Empire & Terror: Nationalism/postnationalism in the New Millennium, Bego√±a Aretxaga, University of Nevada, Reno Center for Basque Studies, University of Nevada Press, 2005 p. 63 Massad has spoken of genetic links being established between 19th-century European Jews and the ancient Israelite kingdom and the creation of a \\"semitic\\" identity for Jews at that time as actually a European, racist construction designed to portray European Jews as foreigners.The Bwog: Lecture Hop: Right to be Racist edition Massad considers claims to Israel made by the Zionists movement based on that connection to be problematic. In a debate with Israeli historian Benny Morris, Massad said: > The claim made by the Zionists, and by Professor Morris, that late > nineteenth-century European Jews are direct descendants of the ancient > Palestinian Hebrews is what is preposterous here. This kind of anti-Semitic > claim that European Jews were not European that was propagated by the racist > and biological discourses on the nineteenth century, that they somehow > descend from first-century Hebrews, despite the fact that they look like > other Europeans, that they speak European languages, is what is > absurd.Joseph Massad, quoted in Andrew Whitehead, \\"History on the Line, 'No > Common Ground': Joseph Massad and Benny Morris Discuss the Middle East,\\" > History Workshop Journal 53:1 (2002), pp. 214-215  On the United States  Massad argues that American imperialism is ultimately behind Israeli actions. He has problematized the mainstream criticisms of the Israel Lobby by explaining the underlying imperialist affinities that tie Israel and the US together: \\"the lobby is powerful in the United States because its major claims are about advancing US interests and its support for Israel is contextualised in its support for the overall US strategy in the Middle East.\\" Massad is especially critical of \\"rabidly pro- Israeli American President Obama.\\" Massad views US culture as deeply infected with racism and misogyny, tying the Abner Louima case to torture in Abu Ghraib, and arguing that in Iraq, \\"American male sexual prowess, usually reserved for American women, [was] put to military use in imperial conquests\\", with \\"Iraqis ... posited.. as women and feminised men to be penetrated by the missiles and bombs ejected from American warplanes.\\" Massad concludes that \\"the content of the word 'freedom' that American politicians and propagandists want to impose on the rest of the world is nothing more and nothing less than America's violent domination, racism, torture, sexual humiliation, and the rest of it.\\" Massad has also criticized Arab intellectuals who \\"defend the racist and barbaric policies\\" of the United States, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in the Arab world. On the Palestinian Authority Massad refers to the Palestinian Authority as the \\"Palestinian Collaborationist Authority,\\" calls Mahmoud Abbas the \\"chief Palestinian collaborator,\\" and accuses the PA of collaborating with Israel and the United States to crush Palestinian resistance.  Columbia Unbecoming  Massad was the center of the Columbia Unbecoming controversy. In fall 2004, a pro-Israel campus organization, produced a film, Columbia Unbecoming, interviewing students who claimed that he and other Columbia professors had intimidated or been unfair to them for their pro-Israel views. This led to the appointment of a committee by the university to investigate the complaints. In response to the film, United States Representative Anthony Weiner called on Columbia to fire Massad for what Weiner characterized as \\"anti-Semitic rantings.\\" The committee concluded its work in spring 2005, dismissed most of the allegations against Massad and the other professors, writing in its report that it had \\"no basis for believing that Professor Massad systematically suppressed dissenting views in his classroom\\" and stated that they \\"found no evidence of any statements made by the faculty that could reasonably be construed as anti- semitic.\\" The committee found it \\"credible\\" that Massad was angered by a question in class from a student that he understood to be defending Israel's conduct toward Palestinians and that his response \\"exceeded commonly accepted bounds by conveying that her question merited harsh public criticism\\", but it also described an environment of incivility, with pro-Israel students disrupting lectures on Middle Eastern studies. Critics described the committee's findings as a whitewash. Massad too criticized the findings, writing that it \\"suffer[ed] from major logical flaws, undefended conclusions, inconsistencies, and clear bias in favor of the witch-hunt that has targeted me for over three years\\". Massad continued to deny the one allegation that the report found \\"credible.\\" Two students beside his accuser said that they witnessed the incident, but a teaching assistant said on WNYC in April 2005 that she was present and that Massad did not angrily criticize the student in question; after the release of the report, 20 students signed a letter stating that they were in class on the day of the alleged incident, and that the incident had never happened. In an editorial discussing the case one week after the release of the Committee report, the New York Times noted that, while it believed Massad had been guilty of inappropriate behavior, it found the controversy overblown and professors such as Massad themselves victimized: > There is no evidence that anyone's grade suffered for challenging the pro- > Palestinian views of any teacher or that any professors made anti-Semitic > statements. The professors who were targeted have legitimate complaints > themselves. Their classes were infiltrated by hecklers and surreptitious > monitors, and they received hate mail and death threats.Editorial. > Intimidation at Columbia The New York Times. April 7, 2005. Ankori threat of libel suit A review by Massad of the book Palestinian Art, written by Israeli art history professor Gannit Ankori, was threatened by a libel suit in Britain. In the review, Massad accused Ankori of illegitimately appropriating the work of Kamal Boullata, a Palestinian artist and art historian, a charge which Ankori viewed as defamatory. The review appeared in Art Journal, a publication of the College Art Association of America, (CAA). To avoid a libel suit, the CAA agreed to issue an apology to Ms. Ankori, to pay her $75,000.00 and to send a letter to its institutional subscribers, stating that the Massad review \\"contained factual errors and certain unfounded assertions.\\" Massad acknowledged \\"minor errors\\", but not libel, and accused the CAA of cowardice. CAA executive director Linda Downs told the Forward that, while \\"there were mistakes\\" in the review, the journal agreed to pay only because it could not afford to fight out the case.

Pithole's sudden growth and equally rapid decline, as well as its status as a \\"proving ground\\" of sorts for the burgeoning petroleum industry, made it one of the most famous of oil boomtowns. Oil strikes at nearby wells in January 1865 prompted a large influx of people to the area that would become Pithole, most of whom were land speculators. The town was laid out in May 1865, and by December was incorporated with an approximate population of 20,000. At its peak, Pithole had at least 54 hotels, 3 churches, the third largest post office in Pennsylvania, a newspaper, a theater, a railroad, the world's first pipeline and a red-light district \\"the likes of Dodge City's.\\" By 1866, economic growth and oil production in Pithole had slowed. Oil strikes around other nearby communities and numerous fires drove residents away from Pithole and, by 1877, the borough was unincorporated. The site was cleared of overgrowth and was donated to the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission in 1961. A visitor center, containing exhibits pertaining to the history of Pithole, was built in 1972. Pithole was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Etymology The city of Pithole derived its name from its proximity to Pithole Creek, which flows through Venango County to the Allegheny River. The origin of the name \\"Pithole\\" itself, however, is a mystery. One origination theory is that early pioneers stumbled across strange fissures from which sulfurous fumes wafted. Such \\"pit-holes\\" are found in the area where Pithole Creek empties into the Allegheny River, with some measuring wide and long. Another possible explanation involves the discovery of ancient pits dug by early settlers, some wide and deep, that were cribbed with oil-soaked timbers. These \\"pit-holes\\", found along Oil Creek and in Cornplanter Township, supposedly predate the Senecas who inhabited the area from the mid-17th to the late 18th century. Geology Most of the oil produced in northwestern Pennsylvania was formed in sandstone reservoir rocks at the boundary between the Mississippian and Devonian rock layers. Over time, the oil migrated toward the surface, became trapped beneath an impervious layer of caprock, and formed a reservoir. The presence of upwards-curving folds in the caprock called anticlines, or sometimes an inversion of an anticline called a syncline, greatly varied the depth of the reservoirs, from around to just beneath the surface. The majority of the oil wells in the vicinity of Pithole and the Oil Creek valley tapped into a sandstone formation known as the Venango Third sand. The Venango Third contained large volumes of oil under high pressure at only below ground level. Other oil-producing formations in the area were \\"the Venango First and Second [sands], the latter often prevailing after the Third sand was lost.\\" At Pithole, the \\"first sandstone was reached at , the second at , the third at , the fourth at , and the oil itself at \\" by the Frazier Well, according to a report by the Oil City Register. Inaccurate numbering of the layers by the drillers, however, put the Fourth sand above the real Third at . Geography and climate Pithole is located in northwestern Pennsylvania, southeast of Erie and north-northeast of Pittsburgh. The nearest cities to Pithole are Titusville, approximately to the northwest, and Oil City, to the southwest. Pithole is located on Pithole Road (State Route 1006), almost southwest of Pennsylvania Route 36 and about east Pennsylvania Route 227. Pithole was laid out with four primary east‚Äìwest streets: First, Second, Third and Fourth. Duncan, Mason, Prather, Brown and Holmden Streets traversed Pithole from north to south. Each street was wide, except for Duncan at . All five north‚Äìsouth streets terminated at First Street; Mason started at Third; Prather and Brown started at Fourth. Duncan and Holmden Streets both began at a Y-intersection with the road from Titusville. All four east‚Äìwest streets began at Duncan and ended at Holmden Street except for First, which extended to the Frazier Well. July is the hottest month in Pithole, when the average high temperature is and the average low is . January is the coldest month with an average high of and an average low of . The average of precipitation a year wreaked havoc on Pithole's many unpaved streets, especially the heavily traveled First and Holmden. Portions of First Street were planked or corduroyed in response to the resulting quagmire of mud that would often trap wagons and draft animals. History The area around Pithole, and modern-day Venango County, was formerly inhabited by Eries, who were eventually wiped out by the Iroquois in 1653. On October 23, 1784, the Iroquois, which included the Seneca, ceded the land to Pennsylvania in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix. Venango County was formed from portions of Allegheny and Lycoming counties on March 12, 1800. Cornplanter Township was settled in 1795 and was incorporated on November 28, 1833.

The images are mounted side-by-side on a card. In 1859, Edwin Drake successfully drilled the first oil well along the banks of Oil Creek, outside of Titusville in Crawford County. Within a half year, over 500 wells were built along Oil Creek, in the corridor from Titusville to the creek's mouth at the Allegheny River in Oil City. Other wells were drilled down the Allegheny towards Franklin and upriver to Tionesta in Forest County. Pithole Creek did not attract the same attention from speculators and investors, who preferred to risk their money on the tried-and-true method of drilling on flatter terrain near large rivers like the Allegheny and Oil Creek, rather than gamble on rougher terrain. In January 1864, Isaiah Frazier leased two tracts of land, totaling , from Thomas Holmden, a farmer along Pithole Creek. Frazier, James Faulkner Jr., Frederick W. Jones and J. Nelson Tappan formed the United States Petroleum Company in April 1864 and started drilling what was dubbed the United States Well, or Frazier Well, in June. On January 7, 1865, the Frazier Well struck oil. Boom Two weeks after the Frazier strike, the Twin Wells, just to the south of the Frazier Well, also struck oil. In May 1865, A. P. Duncan and George C. Prather purchased the Holmden Farm, including the portions still leased to United States Petroleum, for $25,000 and a bonus of $75,000. The wooded bluff overlooking the Frazier and Twin Wells was cleared and a town was laid out. The town was divided into 500 lots, which were put up for sale on May 24\\\\. By July, the population was estimated to have been at least 2,000. The population of Pithole rose to 15,000 people in September and 20,000 by Christmas. Pithole was incorporated as a borough on November 30, 1865. View of Holmden Street from First Street As many residents were temporary, Pithole had a total of 54 hotels ranging from simple rooming houses to luxury hotels like the Chase and Danforth Houses, or the Bonta House located in Prather City on the bluff on the opposite side of Pithole Creek. The Astor House, Pithole's first hotel, was built in one day. Construction of the hotel was especially poor; a lack of insulation and innumerable gaps in the walls made conditions in the hotel miserable during the winter. At one point, the Pithole Post Office, located on the first-floor of the Chase House, was the third-busiest in the state of Pennsylvania, behind Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Three different churches‚ÄîCatholic, Methodist and Presbyterian‚Äîwere constructed by their respective congregations. Pithole's local newspaper, the Pithole Daily Record was started on September 5, 1865. The largest building in Pithole‚Äîthe three-story, 1,100-seat Murphy's Theater‚Äîopened on September 17\\\\. Among all the glamour, \\"every other building [in Pithole] was a bar\\". Prostitution was rampant in Pithole, with most of the brothels built along First Street. Although the borough council passed ordinances banning the sex trade and carried out raids in an attempt to enforce them, they had little impact. As oil production increased through the success of wells like the Frazier, Twin, Pool, Grant, and the two Homestead Wells, transportation of the oil to the outside world was still reliant on teamsters. The teamsters were notorious for mistreatment of their horses, most of which lost their hair due to a buildup of oil and only had a lifespan of a few months in Pithole. The high mortality rate caused a horse shortage, with more having to be brought in by rail from Ohio and New York. Teamsters often refused to work on days when the roads were impassable or gouged the oil producers. Various investors, fed up with the teamsters, pooled resources and built a plank toll road from Pithole to Titusville. Samuel Van Sykle, an oil buyer also frustrated with the teamsters, designed the world's first pipeline, which opened on October 9, 1865. The , pipeline connected Pithole to the Oil Creek Railroad and was initially able to transport per hour operating with three steam engines, equivalent to 300 teams working a 10-hour shift. A fourth engine brought the pipeline's maximum capacity to a day. The Oil City and Pithole Branch Railroad (OC&P;) was opened on December 18\\\\. It was renamed the Pithole Valley Railway in 1871, and was to be abandoned in 1874.Connelly, E: Railroad Operations Vol. 4 2002 p. 46. It ran from Oleopolis, and had passenger stops at Bennett, Woods Mill and Prather.Walker, M: SPV's Comprehensive Railroad Atlas of North America, Northeast 2007 p. 56 A second railroad was partly built but never finished -this was the Reno, Oil Creek and Pithole Railroad, which in 1865 was building from Reno west of Oil City to Pithole via Rouseville and Plumer. The intention was to boost Reno and bypass Oil City. It only laid track between Rouseville and Plumer, went bankrupt in 1866 and was scrapped.Venango County, Pennsylvania: her Pioneers and People 1919 p. 562Christopher T. Baer: A GENERAL CHRONOLOGY OF THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD COMPANY 1865 2015 p. 78 Plans for other railroads never led to construction. Along with the pipeline, another innovation developed in Pithole was the railroad tank car, which was essentially two wooden tanks, each with a capacity of , mounted onto a flatcar. Bust alt=A patch of mowed grass that is indented into the ground. In March 1866, a chain of banks owned by Charles Vernon Culver, a financier and member of United States House of Representatives for Pennsylvania's 20th congressional district, collapsed. This triggered a financial panic throughout the oil region, bursting the oil bubble. Speculators and potential investors stopped coming to Pithole and life in Pithole settled down. In the early morning of February 24, a house caught fire and the flames were spread to other buildings by the wind. In two hours, most of Holmden Street, and parts of Brown and Second Streets, were reduced to smoldering ashes. The worst of multiple fires occurred on August 2, burning down several city blocks and destroying 27 wells. When many oil strikes occurred elsewhere in Venango County in 1867, people left Pithole, often taking their houses and places of business with them or abandoning their property. By December 1866, the population had dropped to 2,000. The newspaper was relocated to Petroleum Center in July 1868, becoming the Petroleum Center Daily Record. Both the Chase House and Murphy's Theater were sold in August 1868 and moved to Pleasantville. Prather and Duncan sold their interests in Pithole before the downturn; Prather split an estimated $3 million with his two brothers and moved to Meadville, while Duncan returned to Scotland with his fortune. The 1870 United States Census recorded the population of Pithole as only 237. The borough charter of Pithole was officially annulled in August 1877\\\\. The remains of the city were sold, in 1879, back to Venango County for $4.37. The Catholic church was dismantled and moved to Tionesta in 1886; the Methodist church was kept in \\"usable condition\\" through private donations before being taken down in the 1930s. A stone altar was erected and consecrated by the Methodist Episcopal Church on August 27, 1959, the centennial of the Drake Well strike. Visitor center alt=A large table enclosed in glass containing many miniaturized buildings laid out to form a town The site was purchased in 1957 by James B. Stevenson, the publisher of the Titusville Herald, who later served as the chairman of the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission from 1962 to 1971. Stevenson cleared the brush from the site, and donated it to the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission in 1961. Today, only a few foundations and mowed paths mark the buildings and former streets of Pithole. The site of Pithole was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on March 20, 1973. A walking tour of Pithole's of streets can be completed in 42 minutes. The visitor center was constructed in 1972. The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission operates the visitor center as part of the nearby Drake Well Museum, adjacent to Oil Creek State Park, outside of Titusville. The visitor center contains several exhibits, including a scale model of the city at its peak, an oil- transport wagon that is stuck in mud, and a small, informational theater. The visitor center is usually open, annually, from the Memorial Day weekend, at end of May, through Labor Day in September. The season is kicked off with the annual Wildcatter Day celebration featuring music, tours, demonstrations and other activities.

It measured 7.4 on the surface wave magnitude scale, and had a maximum perceived intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The earthquake caused fatalities and severe damage to buildings throughout the province, especially in the city of Caucete, where at least 65 people died. It also caused slight damage in the north of the Greater Mendoza metropolitan area. The effects of the earthquake were felt as far away as Buenos Aires, where people were awakened that Wednesday by the tremor. People left their houses at dawn in panic at the Argentinian capital, located at 1,000 km to the East South East. Tectonic setting San Juan Province lies in an area where the South American Plate is affected by flat-slab subduction of the underlying Nazca Plate, the so-called Pampean flat-slab. The very shallow angle leads to a much greater degree of coupling between the subducting and overriding plates. The increased coupling leads to shortening of the crust of the South American Plate, causing active thrust tectonics and rapid uplift, forming the Sierras Pampeanas. The Pie de Palo range is one of the active structures, interpreted to be controlled by major thrust faults. The overall structure has been interpreted as both thin-skinned and thick-skinned. Earthquake The earthquake consisted of two sub-events, separated by about 20 seconds, treated by some seismologists as foreshock and mainshock. The observed focal mechanism was reverse faulting, on a north-south trending structure. From the mainshock alone, it was not possible to decide whether the fault responsible dipped to the west or east. Analysis of the aftershock sequence suggests that two separate faults moved during the earthquake, the earlier event on a segment to the north and the later one to the south. The fault segments have been interpreted as both alternating west and eastward-dipping faults or as an east-dipping fault in the hanging-wall of a larger west-dipping fault. There was no surface rupture associated with the earthquake and it is example of a blind thrust earthquake on thrust faults underlying the Pie de Palo range. Damage There was widespread damage in San Juan Province. The towns of Bermejo and Caucete were particularly badly affected. Many houses constructed of adobe or unreinforced masonry were either badly damaged or destroyed and very large areas were affected by liquefaction. More modern structures, built to earthquake resistant designs, in contrast showed little damage. At least 65 people were killed and a further 284 were injured. The extensive damage left many homeless, with estimates in the range 20,000 to 40,000. The area's wine industry was heavily impacted due to damage to both buildings and particularly wine storage tanks, reducing the wine storage capacity of the affected area by about 10 million litres.

It is located at 367 Addison Avenue in Palo Alto, California.The street lent its name to Hewlett-Packard's employee credit union, known until 2010 as \\"Addison Avenue Federal Credit Union\\". The name changed in 2011 to \\"First Tech Federal Credit Union\\" after a merger with First Tech Credit Union. It is considered to be the \\"Birthplace of Silicon Valley\\". In the 1930s, Stanford University and its Dean of Engineering Frederick Terman began encouraging faculty and graduates to stay in the area instead of leaving California, and develop a high-tech region. HP founders Bill Hewlett and David Packard are considered the first Stanford students who took Terman's advice. The garage has since been designated a California Historical Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Though not open for public tours, the property can be viewed from the sidewalk and driveway. History The home, originally designated as 367 Addison Avenue, was first occupied in 1905 by Dr. John Spencer, his wife Ione, and their two adult daughters. Dr. Spencer became Palo Alto's first mayor in 1909.HP Garage Timeline In 1918, the house was divided into two separate apartments, numbered 367 and 369. In 1937, David \\"Dave\\" Packard, then 25 years old, visited William \\"Bill\\" Hewlett in Palo Alto and the pair had their first business meeting. Both men attended Stanford University, where its Dean of Engineering Frederick Terman encouraged his students to establish their own electronics companies in the area instead of leaving California. In 1938, newly married Dave and Lucile Packard moved into 367 Addison Ave, the first-floor three-room apartment, with Bill Hewlett sleeping in the shed.

They started their own production using the Gazelle name in 1902.  1920-1949  During the period from the 1920s to the 1940s, Gazelle had success exporting bicycles to the East Indies. Many Gazelle bicycles survive throughout Indonesia even today and are a highly sought after Dutch collectors item. During this period, Gazelle was to use the Piet Pelle cartoon character throughout many advertising campaigns. This video from 1925 shows the Gazelle factory and production techniques. Developments include a collapsible delivery bicycle in 1930 and a tandem bicycle introduced in 1935. An electric bicycle was produced in 1937 together with Philips. 1950-1979  In 1954 Gazelle became a public company and built its millionth bicycle. In 1959, Gazelle patented the first 3-Speed grip shift gear system. Gazelle was the first Dutch bicycle manufacturer to introduce the \\"Kwikstep\\" folding bicycle in 1964. The front-hub drum brake was developed in 1968 and is still in production today. In the mid 1960s Gazelle built a \\"Special Racing Division\\" workshop at their factory in Dieren. In this workshop race frames were handbuilt by skilled craftsmen. At the height of their commercial success (around 1980-85) about 35 people were employed. Gazelle had success with the steel framed \\"Champion Mondial\\" bicycles and sponsored the now infamous TVM racing team. The team folded in 2000 because of a doping scandal.  1980-2009  The centenary in 1992 coincided with the eighth millionth bicycle produced. Princess Margriet classified the company \\"Royal\\" Gazelle in honor of the anniversary. From then on one million bicycles were produced every three to four years. In 2009, Gazelle won the Dutch Bike of the Year with the Chamonix Innergy electric bike. This was the first time in the competition's history that an electric bike had won the prestigious award.  2010-Now  In 2010, Gazelle was voted the most trusted bicycle brand in the Readers Digest annual brand survey in Europe.

It stars Monica Vitti as \\"Modesty\\", opposite Terence Stamp as Willie Garvin and Dirk Bogarde as her nemesis Gabriel. The cast also includes Harry Andrews, Michael Craig, Alexander Knox, Rossella Falk, Clive Revill (in a dual role), and Tina Aumont. The film's music was composed by Johnny Dankworth and the theme song, Modesty, sung by pop duo David and Jonathan. It was Vitti's first English-speaking role. The film's production saw creative clashes from director Losey and Blaise creator O'Donnell over the vision of the final film, Losey wanting to create a \\"pop art\\"-inspired spoof of the spy movie craze prevalent at the time, in contrast to the relatively serious and grounded tone of the source material. As a result, the film heavily diverged from O'Donnell's comics and story outline in many ways, and includes a number of non sequitur elements including avant garde-inspired editing and production design, musical numbers, and deliberate continuity errors. Modesty Blaise was entered into the Cannes Film Festival, where it was nominated for a Palme d'Or. General critical reception was far more muted, with critics praising the visual style and off- beat tone, but criticizing the divergences from the source material, convoluted plot, and perceived \\"style over substance\\" direction. Critical reception continues to be mixed decades after release, but the film has gained a cult following. Plot After the assassination of one of their agents in Amsterdam, British Secret Service chief Sir Gerald Tarrant recruits former criminal mastermind Modesty Blaise to protect a shipment of diamonds en route to Abu Tahir, the Sheikh of a small Middle Eastern kingdom. The shipment has also attracted Gabriel, the head of a criminal organization that includes his accountant McWhirter and bodyguard Mrs. Fothergill. Modesty believes that Gabriel, who maintains a compound in the Mediterranean, is dead, but he reveals himself to her. In exchange for an exclusive discount on the kingdom's oil exports, the British government delivers periodic diamond shipments to the Sheikh. Blaise, who enjoys an ongoing love-hate relationship with law enforcement, is recruited not only for her competence, but because she is the Sheikh's adopted daughter and thus trusted by him implicitly. Modesty agrees to the arrangement, on the condition that she is given total immunity by the British government and complete freedom to deliver the diamonds how she sees fit. With Sir Gerald monitoring her from afar, Modesty travels to Amsterdam, where she reunites with her former lover Paul Hagen, a Secret Service agent and aide to Sir Gerald. She calls upon her longtime partner, Willie Garvin, who is reuniting with an old flame, Nicole, who may have information on Gabriel through her employer, an illusionist associated with him. Modesty narrowly survives several attempts on her life by Gabriel's assassins, whose failure leads to their swift execution by the ruthless Mrs. Fothergill. Modesty continually toys with Hagen, first seducing him before stealing his gun and disappearing. When Gabriel learns that Nicole is working with Modesty and Willie, he orders her assassinated. The illusionist sends thugs to have her killed, and they succeed when Modesty and Willie fail to intervene in time. Modesty and Willie set themselves up as live bait to draw Gabriel out, but find themselves pursued by Tarrant and a jilted Hagen, being briefly arrested before quickly escaping with the help of some smoke bombs. When Modesty attempts to identify and infiltrate the boat being used by Gabriel for the planned diamond theft, she is lured into a trap and captured. Gabriel reveals his true plan, to use Modesty as leverage to force Willie to steal the diamonds for him. Willie reluctantly agrees to the arrangement, successfully stealing the diamonds from under Tarrant and Hagen's noses. He and Modesty are subsequently taken to Gabriel's island fortress, where they are promptly thrown into prison cells. Gabriel offers Modesty to join forces, but she refuses. Willie and Modesty manage to escape and kill Mrs. Fothergill, and signal their location to the Sheikh's forces. The Sheikh leads his army to the island, leading to an all-out battle with Gabriel's forces and ending in his capture and the diamonds reaching their intended owner. In his desert camp, the Sheikh leaves Gabriel tied up outside to dehydrate. McWhirter suddenly appears in Highland dress to free his employer, though no one seems to notice or care. When the Sheikh asks Modesty what he can do for her, she asks for the diamonds. He responds by laughing boisterously and she seems to go along with it, but suddenly breaks the fourth wall by looking directly at the camera as the film ends in a freeze-frame shot. Cast * Monica Vitti as Modesty Blaise, a criminal mastermind with a love-hate relationship with the British Secret Service, who occasionally employ her and grant her immunity due to her immense talents. * Terence Stamp as Willie Garvin, Modesty's loyal Cockney sidekick with whom she has a \\"will they or won't they\\" relationship that ends in mutual (possibly sarcastic) marriage proposals. Their relationship differs from the source material, where it is purely platonic. * Dirk Bogarde as Gabriel, another criminal mastermind and Modesty's equal, defined by camp mannerisms and a sensitivity to violence in spite of his ruthlessness. * Harry Andrews as Sir Gerald Tarrant, the chief of the British Secret Service who has a begrudging respect for Modesty and acts as her liaison to the government. * Michael Craig as Paul Hagen, a straight-laced agent of the British Secret Service and former lover of Modesty's. He is an original character created for the film. * Clive Revill as McWhirter & Sheik Abu Tahir, the former is Gabriel's loyal and dogged Scottish accountant, and the latter is the once- deposed ruler of a small Middle Eastern kingdom and the informal foster father of Modesty, whom he calls his 'son'. The latter character takes the role of Modesty's mentor \\"Lob\\" from the original comics, and is otherwise an original character. * Alexander Knox as The Minister, an anxious government bureaucrat tasked with protecting the Sheikh's diamonds, a task is largely unsuited to and leaves to his subordinates. * Rossella Falk as Mrs. Clara Fothergill (credited as Rosella Falk), Gabriel's Amazonian bodyguard and chief of security, a psychopath who enjoys killing people to cure her boredom. She is an original character created for the film. * Tina Aumont as Nicole (credited as Tina Marquand), Willie's old flame now working as a magician's assistant in Amsterdam. She becomes embroiled in her former lover's schemes due to her employer's connections to Gabriel. She is an original character created for the film. * Michael Chow as Weng, Modesty's loyal Chinese butler. * Scilla Gabel as Melina * Joe Melia as Crevier * Saro Urz√¨ as Basilio * Oliver MacGreevy as Tattooed Man * Jon Bluming as Hans * Roberto Bisacco as Encrico * John Karlsen as Oleg * Robin Hunter as Pilot * Robin Fox as Desmond * Silvan as the illusionist  Production  In 1965, Mim Scala of the Scala Browne Agency saw O'Donnell's strip and acquired the film rights to the character. Scala had the idea of casting Barbara Steele as Modesty with Michael Caine as Willie and Sidney Gilliat directing, but he sold the rights to produce the film to Joseph Janni, who had Monica Vitti and Joseph Losey as his clients.Scala 2009, pp. 75‚Äì76. Caine would ultimately star in Alfie, a role intended for his friend and former flatmate Terence Stamp, who wound up playing Willie. Modesty Blaise was released at the height of two cinematic trends: The popularity of James Bond had spawned a number of similarly themed films. Some were intended as serious spy adventures, others as parodies or pastiches of Bond and his genre. Director Joseph Losey and the screenwriters chose to follow the latter approach, by making Modesty Blaise a campy, sometimes surrealistic comedy-adventure. Playwright Harold Pinter made uncredited contributions to the final script. The film was shot on location in London, Amsterdam, and Naples. Interiors were filmed at Shepperton Studios. Gabriel's island fortress was filmed at Castello di Sant'Alessio Siculo in Sicily. Joseph Losey found it difficult to work with Monica Vitti, as she would invariably be accompanied on the set by director Michelangelo Antonioni, in whose movies she had become famous. Antonioni would often whisper suggestions to her, and she would take direction from him rather than Losey. Eventually, Losey asked Antonioni, whom he greatly admired, to keep away from the studios during filming. Antonioni complied. Dirk Bogarde likewise disliked working with her, saying in a radio interview years later that she was the only one of his leading ladies whom he had actively disliked. Modesty Blaise includes a metafictional element during one sequence where Blaise, while visiting a friend's apartment, comes across several newspapers with the Modesty Blaise comic strip, which are shown in close-up; artist Jim Holdaway's work is prominently shown, as is Peter O'Donnell's name. Supporters of the film suggest this indicates that the film is not intended to take place in the same \\"universe\\" as the comic strip.  Comparison to source material  O'Donnell's original screenplay went through a large number of rewrites by other people, and he often later complained that the finished movie retained only one line of his original dialogue. O'Donnell states this in some of his introductions to reprints of his comic strip by Titan Books. As a result, although the basic plotline and characters are based on the comic strip, such as Willie killing a thug in an alley, many changes were made. Some are cosmetic ‚Äî Vitti appears as a blonde for most of the film, except for one sequence in which she actually dresses up like a real-life version of the comic strip character. Likewise, Stamp initially appears in a blond wig and subsequently reverts to his natural dark hair. Other changes are more profound. For example, as the film progresses, Willie and Modesty fall in love and decide to get married, proclaiming the same during a sudden musical production number that pops up during a lull in the action. This breaks a cardinal rule set out by O'Donnell when he created the characters: They would never have a romantic relationship; the writer stayed true to this edict right up to the end of the comic strip in 2001. The character of Sheikh Abu Tahir fills the function of Lob, Modesty's adoptee father and mentor, who gives her the name \\"Modesty Blaise\\". The Sheikh is otherwise an original character with no equivalent character in the source material. Other original characters include Paul Hagen, Mrs. Fothergill, McWhirter, and Nicole.  Novelization  Prior to the release of the film, O'Donnell novelised his version of the screenplay as a novel titled Modesty Blaise. This book was a critical and sales success, resulting in O'Donnell alternating between writing novels and writing the comic strip for the next 30 years. O'Donnell's version of the screenplay was also used as the basis for a late-1990s Modesty Blaise graphic novel published by DC Comics.  Release  According to Fox records, the film needed to earn $5,800,000 in rentals to break even and made $4,825,000, meaning it lost money. Critical reception Modesty Blaise was a moderate success at the time of its original release, Bosley Crowther, writing in The New York Times, characterised the film as \\"a weird film, all right. Maybe, if the whole thing were on a par with some of its flashier and wittier moments, or were up to its pictorial design, which is dazzling, it might be applauded as a first-rate satiric job.\\" According to Crowther: \\"The scenery, a few pop- art settings and a gay, nonchalant musical score are indeed, about the only consistently amusing things about this whacky color film.\\"Crowther, Bosley. \\"Modesty Blaise (1966); Screen: Gaudy 'Modesty Blaise,' girl secret agent: Monica Vitti co-stars with Dirk Bogarde, imported Farrago has flashes of humor,\\" The New York Times, 11 August 1966. Modesty Blaise was entered into the 1966 Cannes Film Festival, where it was nominated for the Palme d'Or, but lost to A Man and a Woman and The Birds, the Bees and the Italians.\\"Modesty Blaise.\\" Festival de Cannes. Retrieved: 8 March 2009. Two more serious attempts at adapting the comic strip for the screen occurred in 1982 with a Modesty Blaise starring Ann Turkel as Blaise, and again in 2003 with My Name Is Modesty, a prequel starring Alexandra Staden in the title role and omitting the Willie Garvin character entirely.

Norwegian- American Studies. vol. 19, p. 116. Little Norway closed in late 2012. History Little Norway began when Osten Olson Haugen, an immigrant from Telemark, Norway, settled on during the 1850s. Mr. Haugen built a dwelling house and other buildings out of timber cut on the property. The Haugen family farmed the land until 1920. In the early 1930s, a Chicago businessman named Isak Dahle was inspired by a recent tour of Norway and memories of his childhood in Southeastern Wisconsin to replicate a Norwegian farm as a gift to his family. He christened it Little Norway and gave it the Norwegian name Nissedahle‚Äîa pun on the word dal, meaning valley, and his surname. Dahle died of cancer in 1937. The site was taken over by his relative, University of Wisconsin Agricultural Economics Department chair Asher Hobson, after Dahle died in 1937. It was taken over by his daughter and later his grandson Scott Winner. After the end of World War II, the owners had offered to sell the facility the State of Wisconsin for $1 but the state didn't want to take on the maintenance of the property. Little Norway closed late in 2012. Owner Scott Winner cited costs exceeds revenues for shutting it down. He has been selling off pieces of the collection to museums and private collectors to help pay a $22,000 annual tax bill. The property listed for $1.9 million as of December 2014. Since its 2012 closure, Winner has spoken with the Wisconsin Historical Society and other foundations about purchasing the property but no deal has been reached.

It was moved to this location and is one of the few examples of Norse stave church architecture outside of Norway. Along with the Maine State Building in Poland, Maine, the Norway building is one of the few remaining buildings from the Chicago World's Fair. After the closing of the Chicago World's Fair, the Norway Building was sold to C.K.G. Billings, a prominent Chicago business man, and relocated by train to his vacation estate in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. While in Lake Geneva, the Norway Building passed through multiple owners, and was used primarily for recreation. During the time it was owned by the Wrigley family it was used as a private theater. The Norway Building fell into disrepair during the Great Depression. It was purchased by Little Norway founder Isak Dahle in 1935. Following the 2012 closure of the attraction, a delegation from Orkdal, Norway, where the chapel was originally built, began to raise money to purchase the Norway Building and ship the building across the ocean. Between the Norwegian government and private donations, that amount totaled $700,000.

The Bel-Air hotel has an overall old Hollywood style and is surrounded by of gardens in the Bel- Air Estates neighborhood. Located just outside Beverly Hills and Westwood, Hotel Bel-Air has regularly housed notable guests and celebrities including Elizabeth Taylor, Robert Wagner, Judy Garland, Bette Davis, Lauren Bacall, Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Jimmy Stewart, Audrey Hepburn and Grace Kelly, who frequented the hotel so regularly she had a suite named after her. Hotel Bel-Air was also the setting for Marilyn Monroe's last Vogue magazine shoot, six weeks before her death.  History  The hotel was originally built in 1922 on of gardens by Alphonzo Bell. Since opening in 1946, the facility, located on Stone Canyon Road, has served celebrities, heads of state and dignitaries. Initially built as office space and riding stables, it was purchased in 1946 and converted into a hotel by Texan entrepreneur Joseph Drown. Drown partnered with architect Burton Schutt to redevelop the property as a luxurious hotel. The hotel was themed on an oasis, with Drown adding Swan Lake, which guests cross by foot bridge to get to the hotel. The grounds are planted in ficus, fig, palms and continuously-blooming flowers. After Drown's death in the 1980s, the hotel was sold off to the Hunt family of Texas and became part of the Rosewood Hotels & Resorts collection. The Hunt family revitalized the property by hiring famed chef Wolfgang Puck to consult on the menu and hotel restaurant. Caroline Hunt sold the hotel for $100 million in 1989 to Japan's Sazale Group. In 1995, the hotel was purchased by Prince Jefri Bolkiah of the royal family of Brunei, then in 2008 the Dorchester Collection, owned by the Brunei Investment Agency, acquired the hotel. After a two-year closure for major renovations, the hotel reopened in October 2011. In 2014, the hotel faced controversy relating to its ownership's relation to the Sultan of Brunei. The Sultan enacted the first phase in adopting aspects of Sharia law to the Brunei criminal code, and his hotels were boycotted in protest.

Bush was the subject of a variety of Google bombs. \\"Miserable failure\\" was the first. In October 2003, an effort was launched to create links of \\"miserable failure\\" to the official White House biography of President Bush. In about six weeks, the link to George W. Bush's biography became the first result for \\"miserable failure\\" on a Google search. A blogger from Washington has since taken credit for starting this tactic, though the phrase had been in heavy use following its adoption as a catchphrase by the Dick Gephardt campaign.Google's (and Inktomi's) Miserable Failure - Search Engine Watch For a time, Bush's official biography had also become the top result for both \\"miserable\\" and \\"failure\\". Bombing of John Kerry Senator John Kerry was also the target of Google bombs. The first of these is the \\"waffles\\" Google bomb. In April 2004, Ken Jacobson, then a law school student at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh launched the \\"waffles\\" Google bombing of Kerry, in part to retaliate for Democrats' Google bombing of George W. Bush. He encouraged linking of \\"waffles\\" to John Kerry's official site. The term \\"waffling\\" is used to describe the back and forth motion of the wings of water fowl prior to landing and is often used to describe a person who cannot decide on a particular course of action. Throughout the campaign, Kerry detractors accused him of changing his position on various issues.  Bombing of Rick Santorum  In May 2003, Dan Savage, a sex columnist and LGBT rights activist, asked his readers to create a definition for the word \\"santorum\\" in response to then United States Senator Rick Santorum's views on homosexuality, and comments about same sex marriage. See Campaign for the neologism \\"santorum\\". Impacts By creating links to the official presidential biography page with text reading \\"miserable failure\\", a relatively small number (possibly as few as 32) of website owners and bloggers were able to make the site appear as the first result when searching for \\"miserable failure\\". Political blogger George Johnston, of Old Fashioned Patriot, claimed to be the coordinator of this particular Google bomb, which began a month after the Dick Gephardt campaign began using the catchphrase \\"miserable failure\\" to attack the administration. In October 2003, he began to encourage his visitors to participate in the \\"bombing\\". Democratic partisan e-mailing lists and blogging groups began passing the word to do similar things in the same time period. The bomb has proliferated beyond the Google web search: \\"miserable failure\\" returns images of Bush on Google Images and Local and Maps return the \\"US Executive Mansion\\" and the White House as the first two results for \\"miserable failure\\" in Washington, D.C.  Google's response  Google originally took the position that it would not alter the result (or any other Google bombed results) because it wished to preserve the integrity of its search engine.

In Christian-influenced magical traditions, they are understood to be the Archangels Uriel, Raphael, Michael, and Gabriel. The watchtowers are invoked during the ritual of casting a magic circle. Types In archaic Roman religion, small towers were built at the crossroads, and an altar was set before them upon which offerings were given to nature spirits. Guardian spirits known as Lares were associated with these towers and with demarcation in general, as well as seasonal themes related to agriculture.Dumezil, Georges, Archaic Roman Religion, volume 1, p. 343 344 Here we may find a connection between the Lares and the Grigori of Italian Witchcraft. These towers may be the foundation of the watchtowers appearing in the ritual circles of Wiccans and other modern witches. In Enochian tradition In the Enochian system of magic, brought to public attention by Dr. John Dee and his scryer Edward Kelley in the 16th century, we find the inclusion of watchtowers as complex evocational designs. According to Dee‚Äôs diaries, the two men summoned an angel, which Kelley saw in an obsidian mirror; Dee recorded the revelations which Kelley narrated to him. Among the surviving records of the Angelic Operations is A Book of Supplications and Invocations which \\"deals with the Invocation of the Angels who preside over the Four Quarters of the Terrestrial sphere.\\"Robert Turner, Elizabethan Magic, p. 24. Enochian magic was later developed into a working system of magic by S.L. MacGregor Mathers. At the core of the instructions was the Angelic Table: a grid of 25x27 squares, each square containing a letter. The Angelic Table is subdivided into four lesser grids for the four elements and the four directions, bound together by the cross-shaped Tablet of Union. They are used to call upon the aid of angels ruling over the four directions. The names of God and the angels to be used in the invocations are extracted from the tablets.Turner, Elizabethan Magic, pp. 59-79 (gives the invocations together with the divine and angelic names for each quarter); Israel Regardie, The Golden Dawn, pp. 630-42 (instructions for deriving the names from the Tablets). The four tablets are often called the Enochian Tablets because the letters may be written in the Enochian alphabet also revealed to Dee and Kelley by the angel. Western Hermeticism Dee‚Äôs work was revived and expounded upon by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, primarily through the work of S.L. MacGregor Mathers. In the Golden Dawn magical system, the four Angelic/Enochian Tablets became the four watchtowers.Regardie, Golden Dawn, Book 9, describes Enochian magic in the Golden Dawn, including detailed information on the watchtowers. Each watchtower was attributed to a direction and an element, by the Golden Dawn. *The Great Eastern Quadrangle of Air *The Great Western Quadrangle of Water *The Great Northern Quadrangle of Earth *The Great Southern Quadrangle of Fire The Tablet of Union was rearranged to form a rectangle attributed to Spirit or Ether. The tablets were brightly colored; squares attributed to the elements were painted in the color of that element, with lettering in complementary colors. *Air - yellow with violet letters *Water - blue with orange letters *Earth - black with green letters *Fire - red with green letters The use of complementary colors, called flashing colors in the Golden Dawn, means that the watchtowers belong to the class of talismans called flashing tablets. The flashing colors were supposed to draw energy from the atmosphere.Regardie, Golden Dawn, pp. 479. The painted tablets were placed on the walls of the temple during some rituals to symbolize the four quarters. A favorite ritual in the Golden Dawn was the Opening by Watchtower. This is actually a preliminary ritual to purify space and call upon the guardians of the four quarters, similar to casting the magic circle in Wicca. As part of the Opening by Watchtower, the practitioner uses the elemental weapons to summon the angels of the quarters. In the south, for instance, the practitioner uses the Fire Wand to trace an invoking Fire Pentagram, then summons the angels using the three names of God found in the Fire Tablet: There is no evidence in Dee's original writings that either he, Kelley or the angels attributed these quadrangles of the Great Table, to the elements as the Golden Dawn did. There is therefore, no evidence that the name Oip Teaa Pedoce is in fact, a holy name for the God relevant to the element fire. There is no doubt though, that it is certainly a holy name relevant to spirits whose names are found in the Southern Quadrangle of the Great Table or Tablet. The watchtowers were among the Golden Dawn concepts introduced into Wicca (modern witchcraft) by its founder Gerald Gardner. The complicated tablets and Enochian names were largely abandoned, but Wicca retained the watchtowers as \\"the four cardinal points, regarded as guardians of the Magic Circle.\\"Janet and Stewart Farrar, The Witches' Way, p. 328. They are usually mentioned during the casting of the circle. In a conservative tradition such as Gardnerian or Alexandrian Wicca the invocation of the watchtowers begins in the east; the practitioner traces an invoking Earth Pentagram while saying;  Modern adaptations  Many Wiccan circle-castings no longer mention the watchtowers by name. Another important development is experimentation with the attribution of elements to the directions, instead of adhering to the attributions used by the Golden Dawn and Gardnerian Wicca (north/earth, east/air, south/fire, west/water). Many Wiccans perceive themselves as participants in an earth-based religion; they believe their practices should reflect their living experience of the local environment. Both the Golden Dawn and early Wicca were active in Great Britain;Jenkins, Phillip (2000) Mystics and Messiahs: Cults and New Religions in American History, p. 74. \\"Also in the 1880s, the tradition of ritual magic was revived in London by a group of Masonic adepts, who formed the Order of the Golden Dawn, which would prove an incalculable influence on the whole subsequent history of occultism.\\" USA: Oxford University Press.Smoley, Richard (1999) Hidden Wisdom: A Guide to the Western Inner Traditions, pp. 102‚Äì103. \\"Founded in 1888, the Golden Dawn lasted a mere twelve years before it was shattered by personal conflicts. At its height it probably had no more than a hundred members. Yet its influence on magic and esoteric thought in the English-speaking world would be hard to overestimate.\\" USA: Quest Books. traditional attributions derived from the British climate may not appeal to or work for practitioners in other climates. A special instance of this problem is the circumstance of Wiccans living in the southern hemisphere, who tend to perceive the north, not the south, as the direction most characterized by fire and heat. Some Neopagans choose to follow the practices of a historical pagan group with whom they identify, or conform to local traditions; either choice may dictate a change of attributions.Farrar and Farrar, Witches‚Äô Way, chapter 25, In Tune with the Land, addresses both environmental and cultural issues in a sympathetic manner.

The original site of the 18th-century fort was uncovered in a 1986 archeological dig. The site is now protected as a Florida State Park, administered through the Anastasia State Recreation Area. Fort Mose is the \\"premier site on the Florida Black Heritage Trail\\". In 1738, the Spanish governor of Florida, Manuel de Montiano, had Fort Mose () built and established as a free black settlement, the first to be legally sanctioned in what would become the territory of the United States. The fort has also been known as Fort Moosa or Fort Mossa, variants of the Spanish pronunciation. Historical background As early as 1687, the Spanish government had begun to offer asylum to slaves from British colonies. In 1693, the Spanish Crown officially proclaimed that runaways would find freedom in Florida, in return for converting to Catholicism and a term for men of four years' military service to the Crown. By 1742, Spain had effectively created a maroon settlement in Florida as a front-line defense against English attacks from the north. Spain also intended to destabilize the plantation economy of the British colonies by creating a free black community to attract slaves seeking escape and refuge from British slavery. Fort Mose Copy of the Plan of the fort of Saint Augustine, Florida and its contours by Royal Engineer Pedro Ruiz de Olano, 1740 Excerpt from the legend of Olano's map of St. Augustine, Florida and environs, drawn by Spanish royal engineer Pedro Ruiz de Olano. The map depicts Fort Mose and the Castillo de San Marcos during Oglethorpe's siege of 1740. In 1738, Governor Montiano ordered construction of the Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose military fort about north of St. Augustine. Slaves who had escaped from the British colonies were directed there. They were recognized as free, and men who passed inspection were taken into the Spanish militia and placed into service. The military leader at the fort, who also served as the de facto leader of the maroon community, was Francisco Men√©ndez, a Mandinga African born in the Gambia region along the Gambia River. He had been captured by slave traders and shipped to the colony of Carolina, from where, he, like many other black slaves, escaped and sought refuge in Spanish Florida. He was appointed captain of the slave militia at St. Augustine in 1726 by Governor Antonio de Benavides, and reappointed to this position by each successive governor of the province. His status as a leader was solidified with the Spanish authorities when he helped defend the city from an English attack led by Colonel John Palmer in 1728 and distinguished himself by his bravery. Fort Mose was the first free African settlement legally sanctioned in what would become the United States and had a total population of about 100. The village had a wall around it, with dwellings inside, as well as a church and an earthen fort. Men√©ndez was freed by Governor Montiano in 1738, on the condition that he convert to the Catholic faith, and baptized as \\"Francisco Men√©ndez\\". Hundreds of thousands of enslaved Africans were imported in the 18th century to the Carolinas, where their labor was essential to the plantation economy. Word of the settlement of free blacks at Mose reached the colonies of South Carolina and Georgia, and attracted escaping slaves. Fellow blacks and their Indian allies helped runaways flee southward to Florida. The Spanish colony needed skilled laborers, and the freedmen strengthened St. Augustine's military forces. In 1738 the Spanish governor established the runaways in their own fortified town (officially known as Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose, but usually referred to simply as \\"Mose\\" in governmental documents of the period). This administrative action followed the example of colonial governments in the Caribbean, enabling the Spanish to hold and populate territory threatened by the Carolinians. The existence of Fort Mose is believed to have helped inspire the Stono Rebellion in September 1739.Berlin 2009, p. 73 This was led by slaves who were \\"fresh from Africa\\". During the Stono revolt, several dozen Africans believed to be from the Kingdom of Kongo tried to reach Spanish Florida. Some were successful, and they rapidly adjusted to life there, as they were already baptized Catholics (Kongo was a Catholic nation) and spoke Portuguese. As a military outpost, Mose defended the northern approach to St. Augustine, the capital of La Florida. Most of its inhabitants came originally from numerous different tribal and cultural groups in West Africa (predominately Kongos, Carabalis, and Mandingos) and had been taken as slaves to the English provinces of North Carolina and South Carolina. While struggling to make their way to freedom in Florida, they had frequent interactions with many Native American peoples. By successfully defending their freedom and Spanish Florida in the mid-18th century, the black inhabitants of Fort Mose had a significant role in contemporary political conflicts between England and Spain in the southeast. The people of Mose made political alliances with the Spaniards along with their Indian allies, and took up arms against their former masters. The black militia fought beside Spanish regular soldiers to drive away the English forces under Gen.James Oglethorpe who attacked St. Augustine in 1740; these black troops also fought in the Spanish counterattack against the Georgia colony in 1742. Following the murder of some inhabitants at the fort by Indian allies of the British, Montiano ordered it abandoned and its inhabitants resettled in St. Augustine. In 1740, British forces led by James Oglethorpe of Georgia attacked and captured the fort in the Siege of Fort Mose. During the ensuing conflict, a Floridian force consisting of Spanish troops, Indian auxiliaries, and free black militia counterattacked Oglethorpe's troops and defeated them decisively, destroying the fort in the process. Oglethorpe was eventually forced to withdraw his forces to Georgia. Because the fort was destroyed, its inhabitants stayed in St. Augustine. By 1752, the Spanish had rebuilt Fort Mose. The new governor forcibly relocated most of the free blacks back into the defensive settlement, from the more cosmopolitan, multilingual culture of St. Augustine.Berlin 2009, p. 76 After East Florida was ceded to the British in the Peace of Paris (1763), most of the free black inhabitants emigrated to Cuba with the evacuating Spanish settlers. At that time, the black population at St. Augustine and Fort Mose totaled about 3,000, of whom about three quarters were escaped slaves.Berlin2009, p. 76 A haven for refugee slaves from the British colonies to the north, Fort Mose is considered the \\"premier site on the Florida Black Heritage Trail\\". The National Park Service highlights it as a precursor site of the Underground Railroad.Aboard the Underground Railroad ‚Äì Fort Mose Site, National Park Service This was the network in the antebellum years preceding the American Civil War by which slaves escaped to freedom, most often to the North and Canada, but also to the Bahamas and Mexico. Modern identification and recovery of the Fort Mose site The entrance of Fort Mose Historic State Park. The site was abandoned when Spanish Florida became British in 1763. It was leveled by the British in 1812 and forgotten. In 1968, motivated by the recent (1963‚Äì1964) racial violence in St. Augustine (see St. Augustine Movement), Frederick Eugene \\"Jack\\" Williams, a long time St. Augustine resident, historian and amateur archaeologist, located the site from an old map, purchased the land, and began a campaign, supported by the Black Caucus in the Florida legislature, to have the site excavated. During 1986-1988 a team of specialists, the Fort Mose Research Team, led by Kathleen Deagan of the Florida Museum of Natural History and under the supervision of John Marron of the University of Florida, performed an archaeological and historical investigation at Fort Mose. Their discoveries showed that Africans played important roles in the geopolitical conflicts between England and Spain in the southeast of what is now the United States. Documents examined by historian Jane Landers in the colonial archives of Spain, Florida, Cuba, and South Carolina reveal who lived in Mose and some idea of what their lives were like in the settlement. In 1759 the village consisted of twenty-two palm thatched huts housing thirty-seven men, fifteen women, seven boys and eight girls. The people of Mose grew their own crops and their men stood guard at the fort or patrolled the frontier in service to the crown. They attended Mass in a wooden chapel where their priest also lived. Most of them married other refugees, but some married Indian women or slaves who lived in St. Augustine. In the first year of excavating the archaeologists uncovered remains of fort structures, including its moat, clay-daubed earthen walls and the wooden structures inside the walls. They found a wide assortment of artifacts: military paraphernalia such as gunflints, lead shot, metal buckles and hardware; household items such as pipestems, thimbles, nails, ceramics, and bottle glass; and food remnants such as burnt seeds and bone. hammocks and salt marsh at the site of Fort Mose. Fort Mose's location on the small tidal channel called Mose Creek (Ca√±o Mose) gave the Mose settlers access to the estuarine mud flats, oyster bars, salt marshes, and other tidal creeks of the North River, which joins the Matanzas River to form Matanzas Bay, St. Augustine's harbor. This tidal estuary was a rich source of food. Analysis of faunal remains found at the site by the team zooarchaeologist Elizabeth Reitz indicated that the Mose villagers had a diet very similar to that of the nearby Indian communities, with a heavy dependence on marine proteins and wild foods. Park facilities An archeological excavation in 1986, led by Kathleen A. Deagan and historian Jane Landers revealed the site of the original Fort Mose, as well as the second facility constructed in 1752. Today, artifacts are displayed in the museum within the Visitor Center at the park. On the grounds, interpretive panels are used to illustrate the history of the site. Three replicas of historic items have been installed within the park: a choza or cooking hut, a small historic garden, and a small Spanish flat boat called a barca chata. Children's book The story of Fort Mose is told in a juvenile book published in 2010. It contains material not typically found in a children's book: an index, a long list of sources, internet resources, and documentation for all the illustrations.

It is widely used in ruminant animal feeds. The structure of monensin was first described by Agtarap et al. in 1967, and was the first polyether antibiotic to have its structure elucidated in this way. The first total synthesis of monensin was reported in 1979 by Kishi et al. Mechanism of action The structure of the sodium (Na+) complex of monensin A. Monensin A is an ionophore related to the crown ethers with a preference to form complexes with monovalent cations such as: Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Ag+, and Tl+. Monensin A is able to transport these cations across lipid membranes of cells in an electroneutral (i.e. non-depolarizing) exchange, playing an important role as an Na+/H+ antiporter. Recent studies have shown that monensin may transport sodium ion through the membrane in both electrogenic and electroneutral manner. This approach explains ionophoric ability and in consequence antibacterial properties of not only parental monensin, but also its derivatives that do not possess carboxylic groups. It blocks intracellular protein transport, and exhibits antibiotic, antimalarial, and other biological activities. The antibacterial properties of monensin and its derivatives are a result of their ability to transport metal cations through cellular and subcellular membranes. Uses Monensin is used extensively in the beef and dairy industries to prevent coccidiosis, increase the production of propionic acid and prevent bloat. Furthermore, monensin, but also its derivatives monensin methyl ester (MME), and particularly monensin decyl ester (MDE) are widely used in ion-selective electrodes. In laboratory research, monensin is used extensively to block Golgi transport. Toxicity Monensin has some degree of activity on mammalian cells and thus toxicity is common. This is especially pronounced in horses, where monensin has a median lethal dose 1/100th that of ruminants. Accidental poisoning of equines with monensin is a well-documented occurrence which has resulted in deaths.

Summers played with the Oakland Athletics, Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, Detroit Tigers, San Francisco Giants and San Diego Padres. Early career Summers, who was born in Bremerton, Washington, served in the United States Army in the Vietnam War and was a recipient the Purple Heart, did not play his first Major League Baseball game until he was 28 years old.Find A Grave website, \\"Champ Summers\\" He was signed by the Oakland Athletics as an amateur free agent in 1971, after being discovered in a men's softball league following his service in Vietnam. Summers came from a family of athletes, with a father who was a prizefighter in the United States Navy and a mother who was a pro bowler. Summers received his nickname \\"Champ\\" from his father: \\"Dad took one look at me when I was born and said, 'He looks like he's just gone 10 rounds with Joe Louis.'\\"\\"Sports sobriquets are laced with puns ‚Äì and daggers\\" (Chuck Wielgus, Sports Illustrated, October 12, 1987) Summers played two years of basketball and one of baseball at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville before leaving for his professional baseball career. He is a member of the SIUE's Athletics Hall of Fame.http://www.siuecougars.com/sports/athletics/mtt/summers_john00.html Professional career Summers bounced between the minors and majors, mostly as a pinch hitter, until Sparky Anderson brought him to Detroit as a designated hitter. Champ's best seasons were 1979 and 1980, when he hit 38 of his 54 career home runs and 121 of his 218 career RBIs. In 1979, he hit a career high 21 home runs, batted .291 with a .401 on-base percentage and a .556 slugging percentage for a .956 OPS. Summers had five RBIs in a single game in May 1979. In 1980, he had another big year, batting .297 with a .393 on-base percentage, .504 slugging percentage and .897 OPS. Summers performance dropped off substantially in 1981, batting .255 with only 3 home runs. On March 4, 1982, the Tigers traded Champ to the San Francisco Giants for Enos Cabell and cash. After two seasons with the Giants, he was traded to the San Diego Padres, where he played his final season in 1984. Summers only hit .185 for the 1984 National League Champion San Diego Padres, mostly as a pinch hitter (36 of his 54 at bats came off the bench). But Summers' biggest hit of the season was a pinch-hit grand slam on April 10, 1984 off of St. Louis Cardinals right-hander Bob Forsch propelling the Padres to a 7-3 victory en route to a sizzling 10-2 start and runaway capture of club's first division title. While with the Padres, Summers was one of the central figures in a series of bench-clearing brawls in a game at Atlanta on August 12. At one point, Summers charged toward the Braves dugout looking to take on pitcher Pascual P√©rez, who had hit the Padres' Alan Wiggins in the first inning, although Perez had been brushed back by San Diego pitchers Ed Whitson and Craig Lefferts while at bat. Summers was intercepted by injured Atlanta slugger Bob Horner and tackled by Horner and two fans that claimed Champ had made indecent remarks to them in the parking lot. Summers ended his career playing for the Padres in the 1984 World Series against his former skipper, Sparky Anderson, and his former Detroit Tigers teammates. Summers struck out in his only at bat in the 1984 World Series, which also wound up being his last major league at bat.

Ridley introduced the first cruiser with a continuously variable transmission, the Ridley Speedster, in 1999, and positioned itself as \\"America's Automatic Motorcycle.\\" Models * Speedster - Ridley's first production vehicle, the Speedster was a 3/4 scale 600cc \\"miniature cruiser\\" fitted with a CVT transmission and V-twin engine. * Auto-Glide Classic (formerly \\"Auto-Glide\\") * Auto-Glide Chopper * Auto-Glide Old School * Auto-Glide Sport * Auto-Glide Trike * Auto-Glide TT * X88 - Sold with a traditional manual transmission. History Clay Ridley began experimenting with automatic transmissions in motorcycles in 1995, when building them for his sons as a hobby. Although the vast majority of cars and light trucks sold in the U.S. use automatic transmissions, no two-wheeled vehicles larger than a scooter did, and so to capitalize on that market, he and his son Jay founded the Ridley Motorcycle Company in 1997, which produced its first model, the Speedster, two years later. Following the success of the Speedster, the company developed a full- size cruiser, name the Auto-Glide, which began sales in 2003, and steadily expanded its line. They sustained annual growth of over 30% from 2000 to 2008, and sold nearly 4,000 units through 2009. Ridley's success was built on a focus of three unique features; low seat, light weight, and an automatic transmission. Ridley found a niche with new riders and female riders by offering the traditional styling of a big motorcycle, but with the ease of riding a scooter. By 2006, Ridley Motorcycles were sold through 55 dealers in the United States and four international dealers. The company entered the Canadian motorcycle market in 2007 with limited success in ten dealerships spread throughout the country. As Ridley saw success with its larger Auto- Glide model, Harley-Davidson immediately sued Ridley over use of the name \\"Auto-Glide,\\" claiming trademark infringement. The case was presented to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin in August 2007 in five days, but Ridley settled on December 28, 2009, after waiting three years with no verdict returned. On the following day, Ridley filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. A motion was filed just the day after on December 30, 2009 by MidFirst Bank, lender to Ridley in 2005 of an amount of $1 million, for the bankruptcy court to authorize the abandonment of the collateral given by Ridley to the bank. Ridley had already voluntarily surrendered its collateral to the bank on October 1, but the bankruptcy was filed before Midfirst Bank could organize an auction, scheduled for January 2010. The assets of Ridley were sold at a public auction on February 16, 2010. Route 66 Ridley Motorcycles acquired the Ridley brand and its remaining $9 million parts inventory, manufacturing assets, and intellectual property.

His exact dates of birth and death are unknown but it is widely accepted that he was born around 1606 and died around 1680. He lived around the city of Mut near Mersin. His tomb, which was organized as a mausoleum in 1997, is at Karacaoƒülan hill in the village of Karacaoƒülan, Mut, Mersin. In this regard, he was the first known folk poet and ashik whose statue was built. His poetry gave a vivid picture of nature and village life in Anatolian settlements. This kind of folk poetry, as distinct from the poetry of the Ottoman palace, was emphasized after the foundation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923 and became an important influence on modern lyric poetry, with Karacaoƒülan being its foremost exponent. Biography There is very little known about his life. Some say he was born near Mount Kozan, near a village called Varsak. Others suggest that he is from the village of the same name, but in modern-day Osmaniye, and someone suggested he lived in Kahramanmaras. The Barak tribe of Gaziantep as well as the √áavu≈ülu tribe of Kilis claim he is from their town. Most, however, believe that he was born near √áukurova and lived among the Turkish tribes in that mountainous region of southern Anatolia. Karacaoƒülan was his pseudonym. His real name is thought to be Simayil, ƒ∞smail, Halil or Hasan. According to Hodja Hamdi Efendi of Ak≈üehir, he was an orphan. He left town at an early age. In some of his poetry it is indicated that he took two of his sisters all the way to Bursa or Istanbul. He spent most of his life in √áukurova and Mara≈ü. Even though not known with certainty, it is believed that he died in modern-day Kahramanmara≈ü. The topics of his poetry reflect the nature in which he was embedded, along with the Turkish nomadic culture of the Toros mountains of which he was a part. The main themes of this poetry stemmed out of nature, love, longing for home, and death. As with other Turkish folk poetry of his time in Anatolia, his language was expressive, yet unadorned, direct, and simple. With a big heart, he fell in love with women and wrote poetry about them getting water from a fountain or making bread. His poetry were in the forms of ko≈üma, t√ºrk√º, mani, varsaƒüƒ±, √º√ßleme, destan, g√ºzelleme and ko√ßaklama. More than five hundred of his poems have survived to this day. He died in 1679.

Combining the rich traditional music and storytelling culture of its native Ayrshire, with a jarring punk ethos, madcap humour and improvised acoustic instrumentation (though usually amplified), the band made a significant contribution to the British folk-punk scene of the 1980s and 1990s. It often tested live audiences with a feedback-laced aural assault, more akin to experimental rock groups like Velvet Underground or The Jesus and Mary Chain, than an acoustic folk act. In addition, Nyah Fearties were known for utilising all manner of improvised and imaginative musical paraphernalia. Examples of the latter included bashing upturned metal dustbins to create percussion, and the use of an archaic gramophone upon which Andy Stewart records were 'scratched' in the style of a hip-hop DJ. Nyah Fearties have been described as a kind of hybrid between Celtic folk-punk outfit The Pogues, and Glasgow-based industrial music band Test Dept.Stuart Cosgrove (New Musical Express: March 14, 1987 page 32) Yet this is a somewhat misleading analogy. As Stuart Cosgrove noted in the NME (March 14, 1987): \\"The Fearties are more critical than The Pogues, their Scotland is not a place to be eulogised‚Ä¶ it's a home whose myths are savagely demolished‚Ä¶they use found percussion but stripped of Test Dept's artiness‚Ä¶\\" Nyah Fearties had at its core the brothers Stephen Wiseman and David Wiseman, although the pair were often joined - both in recorded and live performance - by a wide and varying ad hoc circle of guest musicians, friends and acquaintances. The band were championed by, among others, The Pogues whom they supported on a tour of France after an impromptu 1986 pavement audition outside the Devonshire Arms pub in Camden Town, London. In addition, Pogues drummer Andrew Ranken made a cameo vocal appearance on Nyah Fearties debut album A Tasty Heidfu' recorded that same year. During a 13-year career Nyah Fearties barely emerged from its underground roots, enjoying little or no commercial success while maintaining a loyal cult following. The band did, however, make a live appearance on primetime British television music programme The Tube and hosted a one-off Lugton Loonie Show for BBC Radio Scotland. Following Nyah Fearties demise, David Wiseman went on to help found a new band Dub Skelper, while more recently the Wiseman brothers were reunited in yet another musical project, Junkman's Choir.

It represents a figure of a seated scribe at work. The sculpture was discovered at Saqqara, north of the alley of sphinxes leading to the Serapeum of Saqqara, in 1850 and dated to the period of the Old Kingdom, from either the 5th Dynasty, 2450‚Äì2325 BCE or the 4th Dynasty, 2620‚Äì2500 BCE. It is now in the Louvre Museum in Paris. It is a painted limestone statue, the eyes inlaid with rock crystal, magnesite (magnesium carbonate), copper-arsenic alloy, and nipples made of wood. Description This painted limestone sculpture represents a man in a seated position, presumably a scribe. The figure is dressed in a white kilt stretched to its knees. It is holding a half rolled papyrus. Perhaps the most striking part aspect of the figure is its face. Its realistic features stand in contrast to perhaps more rigid and somewhat less detailed body. Hands, fingers, and fingernails of the sculpture are delicately modeled. The hands are in writing position. Detail Special attention was devoted to the eyes of the sculpture. They are modeled in rich detail out of pieces of red-veined white magnesite which were elaborately inlaid with pieces of polished truncated rock crystal. The back side of the crystal was covered with a layer of organic material which at the same time gives the blue colour to the iris and serves as an adhesive. Two copper clips hold each eye in place. The eyebrows are marked with fine lines of dark organic paint. The scribe has a soft and slightly overweight body, suggesting he is well off and does not need to do any sort of physical labor. He sits in a cross-legged position that would have been his normal posture at work. His facial expression is alert and attentive, gazing out to the viewer as though he is waiting for them to start speaking. He has a ready-made papyrus scroll laid out on his lap but the reed-brush used to write is missing. Both his hands are positioned on his lap. His right hand is pointing towards the paper as if he has already started to write while watching others speak. He stares calmly at the viewer with his black outlined eyes. History The sculpture of the seated scribe was discovered in Saqqara on 19 November 1850, to the north of the Serapeum's line of sphinxes by French archeologist Auguste Mariette. The precise location remains unknown, as the document describing these excavations was published posthumously and the original excavation journal has been lost. Detail The identity of the person represented remains unknown. The semicircular base of the sculpture suggests that it originally fitted in a larger piece of rock which presumably carried its name and title. This somewhat unusual pose was, it seems, reserved for members of the immediate royal family, although not for the king himself. The statue was dated to the period of the 4th Dynasty, 2620‚Äì2500 BC, and is usually associated to the person of Pehernefer. Certain stylistic characteristics, unusual thin lips, broad chest and the posture of the torso might support this theory. The dating itself remains uncertain; the period of the 6th Dynasty has also been suggested. One additional fact in favor of the earlier date is that the statue is represented in \\"writing\\" position while it seems that scribes from the period after the 5th Dynasty have been portrayed mainly in \\"reading\\" position. The Seated Scribe was made around 2450‚Äì2325 BCE; it was discovered near a tomb made for an official named Kai and is sculpted from limestone. Many pharaohs and high-ranking officials would have their servants depicted in some form of image or sculpture so that when they went to the afterlife they would able to utilize their skills to help them in their second life. The scribes were some of the very few who knew how to read and write, and were highly regarded and well-paid. Most people were peasant farmers who had no need for literacy, and \\"although some members of the royal family and high status individuals, as well as officials, priests, and army officers were literate, scribes were needed for operations of the state at all levels.\\" Scribes were used for multitude of things involving everyday Egyptian life, they would be used as tax collectors and were in charge of organizing personnel for activities such as mining, trade and war. Scribes were also used to work on projects like pyramid building and helped communicate between the rulers and the Egyptian people.

This condition often results in a failure to complete the operating cycle, properly termed a malfunction, but commonly (and incorrectly) termed a \\"jam\\". Rifles and shotguns, if fired without the stock in the shoulder, may also be prone to limp wristing. Of the important variables involved in this type of malfunction, bullet and gas momentum, slide and barrel mass, recoil spring pre-load and spring rate, and shooting hand and arm mass are much more important than the compliance (limpness) of the wrist. Overview of the operating cycle The cycling of any type of semiautomatic firearm can be broken down into two phases; the first is the rearward motion of the bolt or slide (hereafter referred to only as slide, which is the most common form in pistols), the second is the forward motion of the slide. The rearward motion of the slide is initiated by the force of firing, and continues using the slide's inertia. While the slide moves rearwards, a spring, called the recoil spring, is compressed, absorbing the energy of the slide while slowing it down. Approximately 50% of the momentum imparted by the bullet and gas is converted into kinetic energy of the slide relative to the frame. This energy is stored by the recoil spring. The other approximate 50% of the momentum is converted to the kinetic energy by accelerating the hand and arm mass. During this phase the fired cartridge case is extracted from the barrel and ejected. When the slide is fully to the rear, it is stopped by the fully compressed recoil spring. The spring then pushes the slide forward, stripping a new cartridge from the magazine and pushing it into the chamber. The firearm is then ready to fire the next round. How limp wristing can cause a failure to cycle Depending on the operating mechanism, there are a number of places that limp wristing can cause a failure to cycle. Recoil operated firearms are more susceptible to failure of this type than blowback and gas-operated firearms, and lightweight polymer framed handguns are more susceptible than heavy, steel-framed or even lighter metal alloy handguns. When there is not enough energy to move the slide back far enough relative to the frame to cycle the action, it is called limp wristing. When there is too much energy in moving the slide back relative to the frame, it is called slide slam. In blowback and gas-operated firearms, the slide reacts against the frame pushing the frame forward slightly against the recoil of the bullet leaving. In recoil operated firearms, the slide reacts against the bullet, and the frame is under no force at the time of firing. As the slide begins to recoil to the rear some of that energy is transmitted to the frame through the locking mechanism (in locked breech designs) and the recoil spring. This transmitted energy accelerates the frame to the rear as well. If the frame is not sufficiently restrained by its mass and the shooter's grip or straightened wrist, the frame will \\"catch up\\" to the slide, and the recoil spring will not be fully compressed, and the slide will return forward under less than the designed force. One common result of limp wristing is a failure to eject, as the slide will be moving too slowly at the point where the ejector is activated. The slow-moving case will be caught as the slide closes, resulting in a \\"stovepipe\\" jam. These jams can be easily dealt with by knocking the used brass out of the way with the side of the hand or closed fist. The other common result of limp wristing is a failure to return to battery: the slide will be moving too slowly to move the new cartridge fully into the chamber, so the slide will stop partially open. The least common form of failure is a failure to feed, where the slide returns to battery on an empty chamber, because the slide moved back just far enough to eject the fired cartridge, but not enough to strip the next round from the magazine. How to address limp wristing As the name suggests, the problem occurs most often with shooters who have a loose grip or allow their wrists to flex or bend too much relative to their forearm during recoil. A firm, two handed grip or a stiffened wrist relative to the forearm will often solve the problem. Some shooters, however, lack the strength for such a firm grip, and in that case there are two avenues that can be explored: changing the firearm, or changing the ammunition. In the event that proper grip and follow through cannot be obtained because of physical limitations, an alternative would be to use a manually cycled firearm action, such as a revolver. Revolvers are a viable option for shooters who have difficulty with semiautomatic designs. The other alternative is to pick a firearm whose frame is heavier in relation to its slide. Polymer framed handguns have the lightest frames, and as the frame is flexible, it absorbs more energy than metal frames. Aluminium and titanium alloys are slightly heavier and much stiffer than the polymers, and steel is the heaviest frame material generally used. Full sized frames are also heavier than compact frames. The heavier frames will have more inertia, and will rely less on the shooter's grip strength to hold the frame still. The other approach is to alter the ammunition used. Low-velocity, light bullet loads such as those used in target shooting have the least energy available to operate the action, and thus are the most sensitive to limp wristing. A heavier or faster bullet will help. Accurate Powder did tests of various powder types in Glock and SIG Sauer handguns, and determined that fast-burning powders caused failures to increase, and that medium- and slow-burning powders (of the range suitable for the cartridge) gave the best reliability. Limp wristing would magnify these changes, so fast powders should be avoided. When the ammo is too weak or the recoil spring is too stiff or the slide is too heavy, and limp wristing malfunctions occur, the cure may be more powerful ammo or a lower-force recoil spring. When the ammo is too powerful or the recoil spring is too weak or the slide is too light, slide slam occurs. Slide slam is bad for the firearm and bad for the shooter's hand. The correct balance is when the ejected casings land approximately 5 feet from the shooter. In this balance there is adequate ejection and no slide slam. When a police force chooses guns and ammo for a diverse population of personnel with low hand mass all the way to high hand mass, the compromise will be to have the heavy-handed experience some slide slam, rather than the light-handed to experience limp wrist-induced malfunctions. The consequence is that those on the force with heavy hands will see ejected cases go further than 5 feet. This small amount of slide slam may cause some tiny additional wear to the slide, frame, and shooter's high mass hand, but it is a better option than a limp wristed malfunction for the low hand mass officers.

Life  Francisco de Moura was the son of the Portuguese nobleman, Manuel de Moura, 2nd Marquis of Castelo Rodrigo, who had been Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands between 1644 and 1647, and of Leonor de Melo. A member of the Corte-Real family, He was a Gentleman of the Chamber of King Philip III of Portugal, later member of his council of state and his ambassador to Vienna in 1651. He was named Duke of Nocera on 10 August 1656, and served as Viceroy of Sardinia between 1657 and 1661, and Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands between 1664 and 1668. Under his administration, the Spanish Netherlands suffered a French invasion during the War of Devolution. By now, Spain was so weak that it could put up very little resistance to the French assault. The French even spoke of \\"une promenade militaire\\". Moura was later appointed as Caballerizo mayor to the King and died in Madrid in December 1675.

Spanning an area of about , the basin is almost totally in Canada (spanning parts of the Prairies, central and northern Canada), with a small portion in the United States (in Montana, the Dakotas, and Minnesota). The watershed's connection to the Labrador Sea is at the Hudson Strait's mouth between Resolution Island in the Qikiqtaaluk Region and Cape Chidley on the Labrador Peninsula. The watershed's headwaters to the southwest are on the Continental Divide of the Americas, bounded at Triple Divide Peak to the south, and Snow Dome to the north. The western and northern boundary of the watershed is the Arctic Divide, and the southern and eastern boundary is the Laurentian Divide. Hudson Bay is often considered part of the Arctic Ocean. For example, the International Hydrographic Organization (in its current unapproved working edition only of Limits of Oceans and Seas) defines the Hudson Bay, with its outlet extending from 62.5 to 66.5 degrees north (just a few miles south of the Arctic Circle) as being part of the Arctic Ocean, specifically \\"Arctic Ocean Subdivision 9.11.\\" Other authorities include it with the Atlantic Ocean, in part because of its greater water budget connection. The Hudson Bay drainage basin coincides almost completely with the former territory Rupert's Land, claimed by the Hudson's Bay Company in the 17th century, and an ideal area for the early fur trade in northern and central North America.
