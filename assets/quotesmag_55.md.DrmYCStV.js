The program was hosted by Brazilian comedian, author and musician J√¥ Soares, and follows the format of American talk shows such as Late Show with David Letterman. It began its life as J√¥ Soares Onze e Meia (J√¥ Soares Eleven Thirty) in 1988 on SBT. Following J√¥ Soares' return to Globo in 2000, the show was renamed as Programa do J√¥, retaining the same format and late-night time slot. The show usually features interviews with three guests and a live musical performance. Usually, if one of the guests is a musician or band, they return to perform at the end of the show. There are also occasions when the first guest stays on to continue the interview past the first commercial break, in which case the show only features two interviews. In most cases, the interviews are longer and more in- depth than those on Letterman's show.  Staff  Sexteto (The Sextet) are the show's house band. They usually perform in the beginning of the show, and during the commercial breaks. In the cases when there's no musical performance by a guest at the end of the show, the sextet (sometimes joined by J√¥ on the trumpet or bongos) also performs then.

Along with and his companion, Sub-Lieutenant Jack Easton, they were called to a mine in Clifton Street, Shoreditch. The street was deserted and the mine could be seen dangling from its parachute, wrapped round the chimney of a terraced house. The pair had to climb through a window into the bedroom, as the mine was blocking the door wedged between a bedstead and the collapsing chimney. Easton set about defusing the mine with Southwell passing him tools through the window. They were working in this way when the rest of the chimney collapsed, setting off the fuse which began to tick.

Location Qastina was situated on an elevated spot in a generally flat area on the coastal plain, on the highway between al-Majdal and the Jerusalem-Jaffa highway. A British military camp, Beer Tuvia, was 3 km. southwest of the village.Khalidi, 1992, pp. 130-131 History =Ottoman period= Qastina was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with the rest of Palestine, and by the 1596 tax records, it was a village in the nahiya (subdistrict) of Gaza under the liwa' (district) of Gaza, with a population of 55 households and 15 bachelors, an estimated 385 persons. All the villagers were Muslim. They paid a fixed tax rate of 33,3% on a number of crops, including wheat, barley and sesame, and fruits, as well as goats, beehives and vineyards; a total of 13,100 ak√ße. 5/6 of the revenue went to a muslim charitable endowment.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 149; cited in Khalidi, 1992, p. 130 The Syrian Sufi teacher and traveller Mustafa al-Bakri al-Siddiqi (1688-1748/9) reported travelling through the village in the first half of the eighteenth century, on his way to al-Masmiyya al-Kabira.\\"Al-Rihla\\", cited in Khalidi, 1992, p. 130 In 1838, Edward Robinson saw el-Kustineh located northwest of Tell es-Safi, where he was staying,Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 2, p. 364 and noted it as a Muslim village located in the Gaza district.Robinson and Smith, vol 3, 2nd appendix, p. 118 In 1863, the French explorer Victor Gu√©rin visited the village, called Kasthineh. He found it had four hundred inhabitants. Near the mouth of a well were the remains of an antique gray-white marble column, while two palm trees and three acacia mimosas shaded the cemetery.Gu√©rin, 1869, pp. 87 -88 An Ottoman village list of about 1870 showed that Qastina had 152 houses and a population of 469, though the population count included men only.Socin, 1879, p. 156 Also noted it in the Gaza districtHartmann, 1883, p. 133, noted 157 houses In 1882, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Qastina as a village laid out in a northwest-southeast direction on flat ground.

Upon Israel's declaration of independence on 15 May 1948, the armies of neighbouring Arab states invaded, prompting fresh evacuations of civilians fearful of being caught up in the fighting. The women and children of Qastina were sent away to the village of Tell es-Safi by the menfolk at this time, but they returned after discovering there was insufficient water in the host village to meet the newcomers' needs.Morris, 2004, p. 176 A preparatory order for the conquest of Qastina and other neighbouring villages (Masmiya al Kabira, Masmiya al Saghira, al Tina and Tall al Turmus) was drafted by the Giv'ati Brigade's 51st Battalion and produced on 29 June 1948. According to Benny Morris, the document recommended \\"the 'liquidation' (hisul) of the two Masmiya villages and 'burning' (bi'ur) the rest.\\"Morris, 2004, p. 436 On 9 July 1948, the village and its over 147 houses were completely destroyed by Israeli forces after its inhabitants fled an assault by the Givati Brigade in Operation An-Far. Qastina was used as a rallying point by the IDF seventh Battalion of the 8th Armored Brigade after the failed attack on Iraq al- Manshiyya in part of the Israeli drive to open a route to the Negev during Operation Yoav.Shapira, 2008, p. 243 =Israel after 1948 war= Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel and four villages were later established on the lands of Qastina; Arugot and Kfar Ahim were founded in 1949 after the village had been destroyed. They were followed by Avigdor in 1950 and Kiryat Malakhi in 1951. Be'er Tuvia, which was also known by the name Qastina after its establishment in 1887, lies adjacent.

Stahl for 20th Century Fox. Set in the North African desert during World War II, it stars Henry Fonda as a corporal lacking in confidence in both love and war, Maureen O'Hara as his girlfriend, and Thomas Mitchell as the title character. The film was based on the novel of the same name by John Brophy. Plot In North Africa, experienced Sergeant Kelly (Thomas Mitchell) leads out a British patrol, accompanied by Corporal Colin Spence (Henry Fonda), an unassertive Canadian. When they are attacked by Italian airplanes, they manage to shoot one down, but it crashes on one of their vehicles, killing eight men. Later, Kelly leads the six survivors on an attack of an Italian armored car, but is seriously wounded. He orders Spence to leave him behind; when Spence refuses to obey, he shoots himself. Spence leads the remaining three men towards an oasis. Before they can reach it though, a transport plane lands and disgorges German soldiers who set up a base. After sneaking in to steal badly needed food and water, Spence has to assert his leadership when one of his men advocates surrendering. Instead, Spence leads them in a surprise attack under the cover of a sandstorm. The British emerge victorious, though one man is killed and Spence is wounded. The corporal comes to in a Cairo hospital and finds he is to be given a medal and promoted to lieutenant. His newfound assertiveness extends to his personal life. He proposes to his girlfriend Valentine (Maureen O'Hara), whom he had thought of (in flashbacks) throughout his ordeal.

He was a medical officer in the army before becoming a bridge designer. Chaley pioneered the construction of suspension bridge cables by bringing together individual wire strands in mid-air, a technique later known as aerial spinning. Previously, the entire cable had been bound together before lifting into place, but Chaley's system, inspired by the ideas of Louis Vicat, allowed considerably longer cables to be erected at less cost.Peters, Tom F., \\"Transitions in Engineering: Guillaume Henri Dufour and the Early 19th Century Cable Suspension Bridges\\", Birkhauser, 1987, He built the Grand Pont Suspendu at Fribourg in 1834, a world record-breaking span of 273m, only overtaken 16 years later by Charles Ellet Jr.'s 308m span Wheeling Suspension Bridge. Chaley had previously worked with Marc Seguin's brother Jules on the Tarascon- Beaucaire Bridge (1828) and also the Chazey-sur-Ain Bridge (1829). Chaley first presented a proposal for the Grand Pont Suspendu in February 1830, and was awarded the contract in June of that year. His estimated cost of less than 300,000 florins was well below other competitors, including Guillaume Henri Dufour. Chaley's bridge was supported on four main cables (two per side), each consisting of 1056 wires each 3.08mm in diameter. It carried 2000 people on its opening day. It was replaced in 1923 by a reinforced concrete arch bridge. Chaley's other suspension bridges include the 227m Pont du Gott√©ron (1840); and a 64m span at Collomby in Valais (1840). He collaborated with Bordillon on the Basse-Cha√Æne Bridge at Angers, completed in 1839. This bridge collapsed in 1850 killing 226 soldiers, a major setback to suspension bridge construction in France and beyond. His only bridge still in existence is the 121m suspension bridge at Corbi√®res (1837).

The Institute of Directors (IoD) named him as \\"Chartered Director of the Year 2011\\" in September 2011 Hughes was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2012 New Year Honours.  Traffic controversy  Hughes received press attention through being prosecuted for exceeding the speed limit in North Wales in May 2007. He received a 42-day driving ban and fine for the offence, imposed by Wrexham Magistrates Court on 5 December 2007. At the time of the offence he was Chair of the Roads Policing Enforcement Technology Committee for ACPO, resigning this position at the time of the court summons. He had also argued for less conspicuous Speed Cameras. In 2006 Hughes was fined ¬£500 by Rotherham Magistrates Court for failing to identify the driver of a South Yorkshire Police vehicle, as a result of him mounting a prosecution against himself.  Politics  In 2012, he revealed his intentions to stand as a Labour Party candidate for the South Yorkshire Police Police and Crime Commissioner, despite previously stating the creation of the position was a mistake. The nomination was contested between Hughes, Anglican Priest Alan Billings and Shaun Wright, a magistrate and local councillor. Shaun Wright won the nomination and was subsequently elected as the PCC. Jay Report In August 2014 Jay Report was published and outlined the widespread sexual abuse (and associated criminality) of young white girls in Rotherham by Britons of predominantly Pakistani origin. The report highlighted that the police did not respond appropriately to reports of abuse by concerned parents and guardians of the victims. Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police when the majority of criminality occurred - 2004-11 - was Meredydd Hughes.http://www.rotherham.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/1407/independent_inquiry_cse_in_rotherham.pdf  References  British Chief Constables People from South Yorkshire Recipients of the Queen's Police Medal Living people People from Cardiff Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Labour Party (UK) politicians Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Meredydd Hughes"},{"id":"14338225","text":"Dundee Our Boys Football Club were a football club from Dundee, Scotland. Founded in 1877, the club merged with Dundee East End in 1893 to form Dundee, with the new side elected to the Scottish Football League. The club played in dark blue colours, which Dundee still play in today. History Our Boys' first appearance in the Scottish Cup came in the 1878‚Äì79 season, losing 3‚Äì0 away to Arbroath in the first round. Some records state that their first Scottish Cup appearance was against South Western the previous season, but this Our Boys club was actually a Glasgow side of the same name. The next two seasons would also see first round exits; 5‚Äì1 again, against Arbroath in 1879‚Äì80 and 2‚Äì1 against Rob Roy in 1880‚Äì81. In 1881‚Äì82 Our Boys reached the fourth round of the cup, defeating Arbroath 2‚Äì1 in the first round, Dundee Harp 5‚Äì3 in the second round and Strathmore (of Dundee) 4‚Äì1 in the third round. Our Boys were eventually defeated 9‚Äì2 by Kilmarnock away from home in the fourth round. The 1882‚Äì83 season saw further success when Our Boys defeated Dundee Hibernian 2‚Äì1 in the first round, Balgay 5‚Äì3 in the second round before being defeated 6‚Äì4 by Vale of Teith in the third round. In 1883‚Äì84 they drew a local rival in the first round, this time winning 3‚Äì2 at home to Dundee West End. A second round 2‚Äì0 home win over Strathmore (of Arbroath) saw them face Strathmore (of Dundee) in the third round. A 2‚Äì2 away draw was followed by a 5‚Äì1 home win to secure their place in the fourth round for the second time. However, they lost 11‚Äì0 away to Pollokshields Athletic in the fourth round. Strathmore (of Arbroath) were again their opponents in the first round of the 1884‚Äì85 tournament, with Our Boys winning 4‚Äì1 away from home. They thrashed Dundee West End 8‚Äì1 in the second round and Strathmore (of Dundee) 5‚Äì1 in the third, leading to a fourth round tie at home to West Benhar. They drew the first game 2‚Äì2, but then lost the replay 8‚Äì3. In 1885, an offshoot of Our Boys left to form Dundee Wanderers. The 1885‚Äì86 tournament began with an 8‚Äì2 away win against Coupar Angus in the first round. However, Our Boys lost 4‚Äì1 away to Dundee Harp in the second round to end their participation for that year. The following season was even more disappointing, a 5‚Äì2 defeat at home to Forfar Athletic in the first round. The first round of the 1887‚Äì88 tournament saw them win 9‚Äì4 away to a club named Aberdeen. They followed this with a 5‚Äì3 win at home to Montrose and a 5‚Äì0 win away to Fair City Athletic in the third round. They received a bye in the fourth round and won 4‚Äì2 at home to Albion Rovers in the fifth to give them a place in the quarter-finals, where they lost 6‚Äì0 to a Cambuslang side that would go on to reach the final. The following season saw a 5‚Äì4 win at home to local rivals Dundee East End in the first round, a 4‚Äì2 home win against Lochee United in the second and a 2‚Äì1 win at home to Dundee Harp in the third before an 11‚Äì1 defeat away to Abercorn in the fourth round. The 1889‚Äì90 tournament began for Our Boys with a 6‚Äì3 win at home to Strathmore. A 6‚Äì5 win away to Dundee Harp followed in the second round, before losing 3‚Äì2 at home to another Dundee side, East End, in the third round. However, the club did win the Forfarshire Cup that season, retaining the following season. With the advent of the Scottish Football League in 1890, the 1890‚Äì91 Cup included league and non- league sides for the first time. Our Boys beat fellow non-league side Forfar Athletic in the first round and received a bye in the second, before beating Dundee East End 4‚Äì0 in the third round. The fourth round saw their first and only encounter with a league side in a competitive game, losing 3‚Äì1 at home to Celtic. The match drew Dundee Our Boy's record crowd of 6,000. The club joined the Northern League in 1891 and shared the first league title with city rivals East End. In the 1891‚Äì92 Cup they lost 2‚Äì0 in the first preliminary round to Dundee Harp after a 4‚Äì4 draw. The 1892‚Äì93 campaign saw a first preliminary round victory over Lochee United, a second preliminary round bye and a third preliminary round defeat to Dunblane after a replay. Grounds Our Boys played at West Craigie Park from 1882 to the time of the merger with East End in 1893. The new Dundee side initially played at West Craigie Park, before moving East End's former ground, Carolina Port, midway through the 1893‚Äì94 season.

Life and career Giese was one of the younger sons of Albrecht Giese and his wife, Elisabeth Langenbeck.J√∂rn, N., With money and bloode, B√∂hlau, 2000, p. 427: this source claims that he was the 12th of 13 children. His father's ancestors originated from Unna in Westphalia, near Cologne, and had moved to Danzig in the 1430s.Gassendi, P. and Thill, O., The Life of Copernicus (1473-1543), p. 179; Ostdeutsche Familienkunde, [East German Family Studies], Volumes 10-12, Degener & Company, 1962, p. 330; Neue Deutsche Biographie (in German) Georg was born in Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk) on 2 April 1497, into a patrician family. His father was the mayor of Danzig, and his mother's uncle had been the mayor of Danzig. He had at least six older siblings, whose names are not entirely clear. Tiedemann Giese, who became the Bishop of Culm (Che≈Çmno), was an older brother.Gassendi, P. and Thill, O., The Life of Copernicus (1473-1543), p. 179; these authors suggest that Georg and his brother, Tiedeman, may have been first cousins to Copernicus At the time of his birth, Danzig was an important Hanseatic town. His family was part of a new type of merchant class, that was beginning to dominate trade in 14th- and 15th-century Europe. Rather than haul goods from one market town to another, these new merchants dealt in goods on a large scale, importing and exporting across long distances. They operated on a world stage, often maintaining permanent offices in the larger European cities which were operated by agents or family members.Honig, E.A., Painting & the Market in Early Modern Antwerp, Yale University Press, 1998, pp 6-10 These merchants formed a fraternity of traders known as the Hanseatic League to control trade and remove trade restrictions for their members. Giese's family had an office in London, which, at the time was the centre of European trade.Fudge, J.D., Commerce and Print in the Early Reformation, BRILL, 2007, p 110; merchants operating out of the Steelyard were exempt from certain taxes and customs duties. Situated in the Steelyard, the London branch of the Hanse, the Giese family office was part of an enclave where Hanseatic and foreign merchants congregated. Many of the merchants there originated from Danzig.Knight, C., London, Volumes 5-6, London, Charles Knight & Company, 1851, pp 53-54 In the 1520s and 1530s, Giese represented his family's interests from the Steelyard office. The painter, Hans Holbein the Younger, produced portraits of wealthy merchants, including Giese and others based at the Steelyard. London's Steelyard Georg Giese's name appears in several documentary sources of the period. An English document from 1522 shows that he was given a protection order to assure safe passage between England and France (dated 26 June 1522; granted by the King of France). Another document shows that he was granted power of attorney to act for Francis Guyse (possibly another older brother) during his absence from the Steelyard while another document states that he was the Alderman's Deputy of the London Steelyard, an important position for a young man (1533). Yet another document from the Danzig Assembly (dated 30 October 1535) identifies the merchant mark of \\"Jorg Gisse,\\" which scholars believe refers to Georg Giesse, and which is the same symbol as can be seen on the seal depicted on Giese's desk in Holbein's painting.Holman, T.S., \\"Holbein's Portraits of the Steelyard Merchants: An Investigation,\\" Metropolitan Museum Journal, vol. 14, 1980, pp 142-143 In 1532, at the age of about 34 years, Giese commissioned a portrait, which scholars believe was intended to be a gift to his betrothed.Holman, T.S., \\"Holbein's Portraits of the Steelyard Merchants: An Investigation,\\" Metropolitan Museum, Journal, vol. 14, 1980, p. 142; Fudge, J.D., Commerce and Print in the Early Reformation, BRILL, 2007, p 110; Michael. E., Hans Holbein the Younger: A Guide to Research, p. 440; Scholars point out that Giese's actual age and the age specified in the painting are not consistent and offer various explanations for the discrepancy. The portrait is noted for the decor and objects that surround Giese in his London Office, all of which attest to his wealth and status as a member of the rising merchant class.Holman, T.S., \\"Holbein's Portraits of the Steelyard Merchants: An Investigation,\\" Metropolitan Museum, Journal, vol. 14, 1980, p. 142; Fudge, J.D., Commerce and Print in the Early Reformation, BRILL, 2007, p 110 After returning to his home city of Danzig, in 1535, he married Christine Kr√ºger, daughter of a prominent Danzig merchant, Tiedemann Kr√ºger and grand-daughter of the Mayor of Toru≈Ñ (Thorn).MacGregor, N., Germany: Memories of a Nation, Penguin, 2014, [E-book edition]; Michael. E., Hans Holbein the Younger: A Guide to Research, p. 440 The couple had ten children.Ostdeutsche Familienkunde, [East German Family Studies], Volumes 10-12, Degener & Company, 1962, p. 330 Giese died on 3 February 1562 in Danzig.  Portrait by Hans Holbein the Younger  mark banknote of 1923.218x218px While Giese was stationed at the Steelyard during the 1530s, the merchant members located there sat for a series of portraits by Hans Holbein the Younger. These paintings were designed to showcase the merchant's status. Giese's portrait is unlike the other portraits of merchants in that it locates the subject in an office where many of the accoutrements of a merchant are clearly visible.Buck, S., Aston, and Murray, C. Hans Holbein, 1497/98-1543, K√∂nemann, 1999, p. 131; Other merchants whose portraits were painted by Holbein include Hillebrant Wedigh of Cologne; Dirk Tybis of Duisburg; Hans of Antwerp, Hermann Wedigh, Johann Schwarzwald, Cyriacus Kale, Derich Born and Derick Berck. See: Holman, T.S., \\"Holbein's Portraits of the Steelyard Merchants: An Investigation,\\" Metropolitan Museum Journal, vol. 14, 1980, pp 139-158. The Holbein portrait commissioned by Giese, clearly identifies him as a merchant, due to the distinctive clothing and the tools of the trade. The painting is rich with symbols. It depicts him with carnations, at that time symbolizing his engagement. A plaque over his head identifies him, and states that it shows him in his 34th year, in 1532. He is holding a letter he received from his brother, written in Middle Saxon (\\"Middle Low German\\"): \\"Dem Erszamen/Jorgen gisze to lunden/in engelant mynem/broder to handen\\" (\\"To be handed to my brother, the honourable Jorgen gisze at London in England\\"). In the background and on the desk, letters, stamps and strips of sealing wax indicate his connections to both his family and a network of traders operating in the region.King, A., Paula Modersohn-Becker, Antique Collectors' Club, 2009, p.121 The various pieces of correspondence use different spellings of Giese's name; \\"Georg Gisze\\", \\"Jorgen Gisze\\" and \\"Georg Gyse.\\" See also * Commerce * Guild * List of paintings by Hans Holbein the Younger * Merchant  Notes   References  Further reading * T.

The club were Founded in 1877 but merged with Dundee Our Boys in 1893 to form Dundee. The club played in pale blue and white vertical stripes, Dundee sometimes play in these colours in honour of East End. History They joined the Northern League in 1891 and in January 1892 lost 5‚Äì3 to Montrose in the Forfarshire Cup Final. Initially the cup was withheld after Dundee East End protested concerning Montrose's late arrival at the game. However, the protest was not upheld and Montrose were declared winners. At the end of their first season in the Northern League they shared the title with their city rivals Dundee Our Boys. Other honours included the Dundee Charity Cup (Burns Charity Cup) in 1889‚Äì90, 1891‚Äì92 and 1892‚Äì93. The club also managed to reach the quarter finals of the Scottish Cup in 1889‚Äì90. Incredibly, East End lost 4 Forfarshire Cup finals in a row between 1888‚Äì89 to 1891‚Äì92. In October 1892, East End played English side Sunderland in a friendly. =Scottish Cup history= East End's first appearance in the Scottish Cup came in the 1882‚Äì83 season, losing 4‚Äì3 away to Arbroath in the first round. In 1883‚Äì84 they again lost in the first round, this time 1‚Äì0 away to local rivals Strathmore. Their first success in the Scottish Cup came in September 1884, an 8‚Äì1 home win against Coupar Angus. The following round saw them drawn again against Strathmore, where a 1‚Äì1 draw away from home was followed by a 5‚Äì2 home defeat. In 1885‚Äì86 the first round saw them drawn at home to Strathmore.

Grounds When East End were formed in 1877 they played at Havecroft Park. In July 1882 they secured the use of Clepington Park for the coming season. They moved again the following year, to Madeira Park, which was first used for a Scottish Cup match against Strathmore on 8 September 1883. In 1886 they moved to Pitkero Park, returning to Clepington Park in 1887, where they remained until gaining entry into the Northern League in 1891 and moving to Carolina Port. In 1893 the newly formed Dundee F.C., upon their immediate election to the Scottish Football League, initially played on Our Boys' West Craigie Park ground; this lasted for only one season before they moved to Carolina Port. In 1899 Dundee moved to Dens Park where they remain to the present day. Another local side, Dundee Wanderers, played on East End's old Clepington Park ground from 1891 onwards; it later became Tannadice Park, home of Dundee United.

It is a close relative of Asplenium ruprechtii (syn: Camptosorus sibiricus) which is found in East Asia and also goes by the common name of \\"walking fern\\".Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online Description Asplenium rhizophyllum is a small fern whose undivided, evergreen leaves and long, narrow leaf tips, sometimes curving back and rooting, give it a highly distinctive appearance. It grows in tufts, often surrounded by child plants formed from the leaf tips. The leaves of younger plants tend to lie flat to the ground, while older plants have leaves more erect or arching. =Roots and stipes= It does not spread and form new plants via the roots. Its rhizomes (underground stems) are upright or nearly so, short, about in diameter, and generally unbranched. They bear dark brown or blackish, narrowly triangular or lance-shaped scales which are strongly clathrate (bearing a lattice-like pattern). The scales are long and wide (occasionally as narrow as ) with untoothed margins. The stipe (the stalk of the leaf, below the blade) is long (occasionally up to long), and ranges from one-tenth to one and one-half times the length of the blade. The stipe is reddish-brown and sometimes shiny at the base, becoming green above, and narrowly winged. Scales like those of the rhizome are present at the stipe base, changing to tiny club-shaped hairs above. =Leaves= Asplenium rhizophyllum plantlet sprouting from the leaf apex of its parent plant The leaf blades are not subdivided, as in most other ferns, but are narrowly triangular to linear or lance-shaped. Their shape can be quite variable, even on the same plant. They measure from long and from across and have a leathery texture with sparse hairs, more abundant below than above. The rachis (leaf axis) is dull green in color and almost devoid of hairs. On the underside of the blade, the veins are difficult to see and anastomose (split and rejoin each other), forming a series of areoles (the small areas enclosed by the veins) near the rachis. Fertile fronds are usually larger than sterile fronds, but their shape is otherwise the same. The base of the blade is typically heart-shaped (with the stipe protruding from the cleft); the bulges on either side of the cleft are frequently enlarged into auricles (rounded lobes), or occasionally into sharply-pointed, tapering lobes. The leaf tips may be rounded but are typically very long and attenuate (drawn out); the attenuate tips are capable of sprouting roots and growing into a new plant when the tip touches a surface suitable for growth. On rare occasions, the auricles at the leaf base will also take on an attenuate shape and form roots at the tip. The ability of the leaf tips to root and form a new plant at some distance from the parent gives the species its common name. The young leaves forming from a bud at the leaf tip are round to pointed at their apex, not yet having developed the long-attenuate shape. Specimens of A. rhizophyllum with forked blades have been found in Arkansas and Missouri. The fork usually occurs in the tip, perhaps due to growth after insect damage, but one specimen was found forking from the upper part of the stipe. =Sori and spores= Fertile fronds bear a large number of sori underneath, long, which are not arranged in any particular order. The sori are often fused where veins join, and may curve to follow the vein to which they are attached. The sori are covered by inconspicuous thin, white indusia with untoothed edges. Each sporangium in a sorus carries 64 spores. The diploid sporophyte has a chromosome number of 72. =Similar species= The leaf shape and proliferating tips easily distinguish A. rhizophyllum from most other ferns. Its hybrid descendants share the long-attenuate leaf tip, but are more deeply lobed. An artificial backcross between A. rhizophyllum and A. tutwilerae was closer to A. rhizophyllum in morphology, but still remained some lobes in the basal part of the blade, had a shallowly undulating, rather than smoothly curved, leaf edge in the apical part, showed a maroon color in the stipe up to the base of the leaf blade, and possessed the abortive spores of a sterile hybrid. A. ruprechtii, the Asian walking fern, also possesses attenuate, proliferating tips, but has a lanceolate leaf blade, which tapers to a wedge at the base rather than forming a heart shape. A. scolopendrium, the hart's-tongue fern, has larger, longer leaves that are glossy with a rounded tip. Taxonomy This species is commonly known as North American walking fern or simply walking fern, because the growth of new plants at the leaf tip allows it to \\"walk\\" across surfaces over several generations. The specific epithet \\"rhizophyllum\\", meaning \\"root leaf\\", also reflects this characteristic. Linnaeus first gave the walking fern the binomial Asplenium rhizophyllum in his Species Plantarum of 1753. In 1833, J.H.F. Link placed the species in a segregate genus, Camptosorus, because of the irregular arrangement of its sori (in contrast to the rest of Asplenium, where the sori are confined to the edge of veins). John Smith did not feel that this character was sufficient to segregate it from the rest of Asplenium, but placed it in the genus Antigramma, another Asplenium segregate, on the basis of its reticulate venation, to the convolutions of which he attributed the soral arrangement. It was commonly placed either in Asplenium and Camptosorus by later authors, but phylogenetic studies have shown that Camptosorus is nested within Asplenium and its species should be treated as part of that genus. The name Asplenium rhizophyllum has also been applied to two other species; in current botanical practice, these are illegitimate later homonyms of Linnaeus' name of 1753. The first of these homonyms was created by Linnaeus himself in 1763, when he accidentally used the name twice, applying it first to his original taxon and again to a species from the West Indies which also proliferates at the leaf tips. He had referred to the West Indian species as A. radicans in 1759, the name by which it is known today. In 1834, Gustav Kunze transferred the species Caenopteris rhizophylla to Asplenium without changing the epithet; George Proctor identified this species, based on a specimen from Dominica, with A. conquisitum, now synonymized with A. rutaceum. =Hybrids= Walking fern is one of the three parental species of the \\"Appalachian Asplenium complex\\", a group of Asplenium hybrids and their progenitors known from eastern North America. Hybridization between walking fern and mountain spleenwort (A. montanum) has given rise through chromosome doubling to a new, fertile, species, lobed spleenwort (A. pinnatifidum). The sterile hybrid between walking fern and ebony spleenwort (A. platyneuron), known as Scott's spleenwort ( A. √ó ebenoides), may be found where the two parents are in contact; at one locality, in Havana Glen, Alabama, A. √ó ebenoides has undergone chromosome doubling to produce a fertile species, Tutwiler's spleenwort (A. tutwilerae). Much more rarely, walking fern hybridizes with two other common spleenworts of eastern North America. The hybrid between walking fern and wall-rue (A. ruta-muraria), known as unexpected spleenwort (A. √ó inexpectatum), is known from a single specimen collected on dolomite in Adams County, Ohio. The hybrid between walking fern and maidenhair spleenwort, (A. trichomanes ssp. trichomanes), Shawnee spleenwort (A. √ó shawneense), is known from one collection on sandstone in the Shawnee Hills of Illinois. A triploid hybrid between walking fern and Tutwiler's spleenwort was accidentally produced in culture. A similar plant collected from limestone in Shepherdstown, West Virginia could have originated from the same parents, from an unreduced (diploid) gametophyte of Scott's spleenwort crossed with walking fern, or from an unreduced walking fern gametophyte crossed with ebony spleenwort. =Infraspecific taxa= In 1813, Henry Muhlenberg listed lobed spleenwort as Asplenium rhizophyllum var. pinnatifidum, although he did not provide a description distinguishing the variety from the typical species. It was described as the species A. pinnatifidum by Thomas Nuttall in 1818. A number of forms have been described, of limited taxonomic value. In 1883, J. C. Arthur described walking ferns from limestone cliffs in Muscatine County, Iowa that lacked auricles at the leaf base, with the blade abruptly tapering at the base instead. In this respect, the plants closely resembled A. ruprechtii, but the leaf shape of the Iowa plants was lanceolate (widest near the base) rather than ovate (widest in the middle), and the wide point of the leaf in the Iowa plants appeared slightly lobed. He named these plants Camptosorus rhizophyllus var. intermedius; the variety was subsequently given the status of a form by Willard N. Clute. In 1922, Ralph Hoffmann gave the name C. rhizophyllus f. auriculatus to specimens with proliferating auricles, based on material on limestone from New Marlborough, Massachusetts. In 1924, Frederick W. Gray described as C. rhizophyllus f. angustatus material from a sandstone boulder in Monroe County, West Virginia. These had a short stipe, less than long, and narrow leaf blades, less than wide, with the sori almost at the margins. He argued that as they were found along with normal material, they were not solely due to sun exposure. Finally, in 1935, Carl L. Wilson described C. rhizophyllus f. boycei based on material collected from the base of a limestone boulder in Highgate Springs, Vermont by Guy Boyce. These plants had deeply lobed auricles, and erose (jagged or indented) leaf margins with rounded edges. Distribution Range map of Asplenium rhizophyllum The principal range of A. rhizophyllum is in the Appalachian Mountains and the Ozarks. It can be found from southern Quebec and Ontario along the Appalachians and Piedmont southwestward to Mississippi and Alabama, along the Ohio Valley and into the Ozarks west to Nebraska and Oklahoma, and along the Mississippi Valley north to Wisconsin and Minnesota. It has become extinct in Maine and Delaware. The distribution typically follows area of limy soil; sometimes said to be rare, it is better described as locally abundant where conditions favor it. Ecology and conservation Walking fern grows on shaded boulders, ledges and in crevices, usually covered with moss. On rare occasions, it is found on fallen tree trunks, as an epiphyte, or on the ground. It is usually found on limestone or other alkaline rocks, rarely on sandstone or other acidic rocks. While globally secure, it is endangered in some states and provinces at the edge of its range. NatureServe considers it critically imperiled (S1) in Mississippi, New Hampshire and Rhode Island, imperiled (S2) in Michigan and South Carolina, and vulnerable (S3) in North Carolina and Quebec. Cultivation It was introduced into cultivation in England in 1680. It prefers low to medium light levels, and a moist, basic potting mix, or soil with added lime chips.

Chevalier de Baugy arrived at Quebec in 1682 and immediately became involved in the fur trade of the Great Lakes; namely, putting an end to the dominant position of Cavelier de La Salle in that area. Under La Barre's authority, de Baugy took control of Fort Saint Louis (Illinois) on the Illinois River from Henri Tonty in 1683. In February, 1684, the fort was besieged by a force of 500 Iroquois for eight days. Despite limited ammunition and provisions, the defenders withstood three assaults, and the Iroquois were forced to abandon their attacks and withdraw the way they had come. In 1685, La Salle was given back control of Fort Saint Louis by the French king. De Baugy took part in at least one more campaign in Canada, in 1687 with Denonville against the Senecas. De Baugy, as Denonville's aide-de-camp, left a valuable journal of his experiences during the expedition.https://archive.org/details/journalduneexp00baug In 1689, he left for France and did not return.

Career  Born in Nepean, Ontario, Campbell began his career playing for the junior OHL team, the Belleville Bulls. Campbell spent two seasons as a Bulls player, appearing in almost 150 games, scoring 73 points. For the 1999/00 season, Campbell signed for the Owen Sound Platers, another OHL team. Campbell would only stay one season, but in 55 games would manage a ratio of close to one point per game. He would also play for the Fort Wayne Komets on ten occasions, totalling eight UHL points. For the following season, Campbell would continue at junior level, this time with the Kingston Frontenacs. In 61 games, he would manage an impressive 72 points, his best total yet. Campbell would start his college career in the 2001/02 season, turning out for St. Thomas University of New Brunswick. In his three University seasons, Campbell played in 78 games and scored 89 points, with 239 penalty minutes. When his University level career came to an end in the 2003/04 season, Campbell took the opportunity to sign with an AHL team, the Binghamton Senators, the affiliate team of the well-known NHL Ottawa Senators. Campbell's opportunities were limited however, and he made just three appearances for the Binghamton team all season. For the 2004/05 term, Campbell would be dropped down to UHL level, playing for the Elmira Jackals 58 times, but managing just 18 points. In the same season, Campbell would play for Binghamton for a second time, but again managed just three appearances. For the 2005/06 season, Campbell changed clubs to sign for the Houston Aeros, a team affiliated with the Minnesota Wild. He would again struggle to make regular AHL appearances, managing just two for his new team. Campbell would split the rest of the season between two ECHL teams, the Stockton Thunder and the Columbia Inferno, and despite a solid points output failed to settle at either. In the summer of 2006, Campbell would move to Europe to play for the Manchester Phoenix under player/coach Tony Hand. At the time he Phoenix played at EIHL level, the highest standard of club ice hockey in Britain. In 59 regular season games, he managed 71 points as well as 224 penalty minutes. After his season in Manchester, Campbell decided to again move teams. He would stay in the EIHL though, signing for the Newcastle Vipers. A second strong season would follow, and Campbell managed to total over a point per game throughout the regular season, with 66 points in 64 games. This productivity encouraged Newcastle head coach Rob Wilson to re-sign Campbell for the Vipers, a deal which was announced in June 2008. A second high-scoring season for the Vipers would follow, taking Campbell to a total of 187 points in 178 EIHL games. His proven Elite League record convinced Paul Thompson to sign Campbell for the Coventry Blaze in the summer of 2009. After spending the 2010/11 season with the Sheffield Steelers, Campbell once again moved on within the EIHL, signing with the Hull Stingrays for 2011/12. Derek has now started playing his 2012/13 season back in Sheffield with the Sheffield Steeldogs in the EPL. On October 6, 2013, while playing for the Hull Stingrays, Campbell was involved in a fight on the ice that saw him ejected from the game for driving an opponent's head to the ice. Shortly afterwards, he was seen outside of the opponent's dressing room, where he attacked another player from the opposing team. He was restrained by fans and led back to his dressing room. 3 days later, the Stingrays released Campbell from his contract. Later that same day, he was suspended by the league for 47 games; 15 for fighting off the ice, 12 for an attempted eye gouge, 10 for a knee to the head and 10 for excessive force to the head resulting in an impact to the ice.

C. Langfitt (AP-151) was a for the U.S. Navy in World War II. She was named in honor of U.S. Army general William Campbell Langfitt. She was transferred to the U.S. Army as USAT General W. C. Langfitt in 1946. On 1 March 1950 she was transferred to the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) as USNS General W. C. Langfitt (T-AP-151). She was later sold for commercial operation under the name SS Transindiana, before ultimately being scrapped in 1983. Operational history General W. C. Langfitt (AP-151) was launched under Maritime Commission contract (MC #703) 17 July 1944 by the Kaiser Co., Inc., Yard 3, Richmond, California; sponsored by Mrs. William E. Lynd; acquired by the Navy and simultaneously commissioned 30 September 1944, Captain Kenneth O. Ekelund in command. After shakedown, General W. C. Langfitt embarked marines and departed San Diego 10 November 1944 for Eniwetok and Saipan via Pearl Harbor. Returning to San Francisco 5 January 1945, she embarked troops and sailed 19 January for the Western Pacific where she shuttled troops to Finschhafen and Hollandia, New Guinea; Leyte, Philippines; Ulithi, Caroline Islands; and Kossol Roads, Palaus. Loaded with medical patients and returning veterans, she departed Hollandia for the United States 22 March and arrived San Francisco 10 April. On the 21st, the busy ship again sailed for the Western Pacific; and, after steaming via Pearl Harbor to the Admiralty Islands, the Philippines, and the Marshalls, she returned 2,302 passengers to San Francisco, arriving 11 June. Having contributed so much to the rising tide of victory in the Pacific, she sailed 15 June for Norfolk, reaching there 30 June. General W. C. Langfitt departed 16 July for France, where on the 26th she embarked troops at Marseilles for redeployment to the Pacific. She departed 28 July and sailed via the Panama Canal to Hollandia and points in the Philippines. As a unit of the \\"Magic Carpet\\" fleet, she departed Leyte 18 September, arriving Seattle 3 October. The transport departed again for the Western Pacific 25 October; carried occupation troops to Nagoya, Japan; and steamed to the Philippines before returning to San Francisco 10 December. Between 22 December and 16 April 1946 General W. C. Langfitt made two more \\"Magic Carpet\\" voyages to the Philippines and back bringing home thousands of veterans. After returning to San Francisco 16 April, she steamed to New York where she arrived 20 May. She decommissioned there 6 June 1946 and was returned to WSA for use by the Army Transport Service. In February 1949 the General W. C. Langfitt left Bremerhaven with European immigrants and arrived in Buenos Aires on 25 March 1949. On 22 May 1949 USAT General W. C. Langfitt left Naples with 826 displaced persons from Europe and arrived in Melbourne on 17 June 1949. This voyage was one of almost 150 \\"Fifth Fleet\\" voyages by some 40 ships bringing refugees of World War II to Australia. General W. C. Langfitt made two more such trips to Melbourne with 826 refugees on 22 September 1949, and with 1,282 on 14 January 1950. The fourth and final group taken to Australia by General W. C. Langfitt arrived in Fremantle on 18 February 1950 and consisted of 1,118 displaced persons of Polish descent. The group embarked on their voyage in Mombasa, Kenya in late January and early February 1950. This particular group of migrants, referred to as \\"The General Langfitt Group\\", was chronicled in the 1995 book The General Langfitt story: Polish refugees recount their experiences of exile, dispersal, and resettlement. The book tells the story of the group‚Äôs exile in the Soviet Union and journeys that took them from that country to Iran, India, East Africa, and finally Australia. General W. C. Langfitt was reacquired by the Navy 1 March 1950 for assignment as an overseas transport under MSTS. She undertook the job of carrying troops, dependents, and even refugees to the far corners of the world, making round-the-world voyages in 1952 and 1953. Between 24 November 1954 and 30 April 1957 she made 32 voyages from New York to Bremerhaven, Germany, and back, carrying European refugees to the United States under the Refugees Relief Act. Following the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, she operated with MSTS transport and brought over 45,000 Hungarian refugees to the United States. Since she was making the trips back to Europe empty she was used to carry American Field Service students to Europe during early summer of 1955. After carrying additional refugees from Europe to Australia during May and June 1957, General W. C. Langfitt arrived New York 13 July and was inactivated there 30 September. Transferred to the Maritime Administration on 13 May 1958, she was berthed with the National Defense Reserve Fleet, James River, Virginia. In 1968 the ship was sold to Hudson Waterways Corporation of New York and rebuilt as a 13,489-ton, container vessel by the Maryland Shipbuilding and Drydock Co. of Baltimore. She entered commercial service as SS Transindiana, USCG ON 513582, IMO 6904844, in December 1969. and began hauling containerized cargo for Seatrain Lines.

She was used by the Union Navy as a gunboat in support of the Union naval blockade of Confederate waterways. Because of her relatively large size, she was also sometimes used as a cargo ship. Service history By February 1863, Augusta Dinsmore‚Äîa screw steamer completed in 1863 at Mystic, Connecticut‚Äîwas operating for the Adams Express Company, moving up and down the Atlantic coast between Northern ports and the Union Navy's blockaders off Charleston, South Carolina, engaged primarily in carrying mail, passengers, and supplies to and from the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Sometime in the late spring or early summer, she was chartered by the Navy for the use of that squadron and departed New York City on the morning of 30 June, carrying Rear Admiral John A. Dahlgren‚Äîwho was to relieve Rear Admiral Samuel Francis Du Pont in command of the squadron‚Äîand new commanding officers for several warships assigned to the blockade. The steamer arrived off Port Royal, South Carolina, shortly after daybreak on 4 July. Two days later, the formal change of command took place on board , Du Font's flagship. Meanwhile, the Navy Department chose to buy the ship outright instead of using her for a protracted period under a charter and wrote to Dahlgren on 9 July informing him of the decision. The transaction transferring title to the ship from William B. Dinsmore to the United States Government was completed on 17 July; and, four days later, Dahlgren detached Acting Master William Hamilton from the monitor so that he might assume command of Augusta Dinsmore. Although the steamer's commissioned service dates from Hamilton's taking command, she had already served as Dahlgren's flagship during most of the time since she had brought him from New York City; and, but for a few brief interruptions when he temporarily embarked in other warships, she continued to carry out this duty through the remainder of July and most of August. While his flag flew above Augusta Dinsmore, the admiral directed the naval aspects of joint Army-Navy operations against the defensive works which protected Charleston, South Carolina‚Äôs harbor, particularly against Fort Wagner. These attacks finally forced the Confederate garrison to evacuate the fort secretly on the night of 6 September. While this unrelenting Union pressure was approaching its victorious climax, the iron-hulled, side-wheel steamer had arrived off Morris Island late in August and relieved Augusta Dinsmore as flagship, freeing her for other duty. Dahlgren had only recently learned that the screw gunboat in Saint Catherine Sound‚Äîjust south of Savannah, Georgia‚Äîwas low on coal and in need of repairs. As a result, he sent Augusta Dinsmore to that station to take Madgie's place on guard there, and she blockaded those waters until 5 October when she was relieved by the side-wheeler . Before sailing north at mid-month, Augusta Dinsmore embarked 149 men whose enlistments had expired. She stopped en route at Newport News, Virginia, for brief repairs and then continued on to New York City. After the completion of her repairs there, Augusta Dinsmore was reassigned to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron and sailed for Key West, Florida, on 12 December 1863. When she reported to Rear Admiral David Farragut, he put her to work as a dispatch and supply ship and, for most of her remaining service, she operated out of New Orleans, Louisiana, carrying information and materiel to warships blockading on various stations along the Texas coast. Occasionally, her discharge of this duty was interrupted by temporary blockade duty when one of the regular blockaders became disabled, and no other replacement was available. However, she always soon returned to her regular logistical work and carried out this duty faithfully. On occasion, chance encounters with blockade runners broke the monotony of her tedious, but highly important assignment. On 16 February, Acting Master Hamilton‚Äîhaving learned that the cotton-and-hide-laden Scio was preparing to depart Brazos Santiago, Texas, in violation of the blockade‚Äîseized that British brig and placed a crew from Augusta Dinsmore on board the prize. However, before Hamilton could tow Scio across the bar to begin the voyage to a prize court, a Union Army officer \\". . . informed him that he [the Army man] had orders not to allow the vessel to proceed to sea.\\" On 25 February, after protracted correspondence on the subject, Hamilton received a letter from Major General Francis Jay Herron \\"...ordering him to release the Scio, which...[Hamilton], not wishing to have a collision with the Army, did...under protest...\\" The matter was ultimately brought to the attention of both the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of War, but records of the final disposition of the case have not been found. In the spring of 1864, Hamilton became ill and, sometime in June, Acting Volunteer Lieutenant Miner B. Crowell relieved him in command of Augusta Dinsmore. About daybreak on 11 September, as the steamer was proceeding generally southwest along the gulf coast from Galveston, Texas, she \\". . . fell in with a schooner, with sails lowered down, drifting.\\" Since the vessel‚Äîthe British schooner John‚Äîwas carrying 81 bales of cotton, Crowell \\"...seized her as a prize and sent her to New Orleans for adjudication...\\" On 28 October 1864, Augusta Dinsmore was making another supply run when she found herself in position to help Union screw gunboats and to capture another British schooner, Cora Smyser, which was attempting to slip into San Luis Pass, Texas, with an assorted cargo. Augusta Dinsmore continued to carry supplies to blockaders along the Texas coast through the end of the Civil War. Following the Confederate collapse, she departed Pensacola, Florida, on 5 August and sailed north. She was decommissioned at New York on 28 August 1865 and sold at public auction there on 5 September 1865. Re-documented as Gulf City on 16 September 1865, the steamer remained in merchant service until she ran aground off Cape Lookout, North Carolina, on 11 January 1869. The wreck cost the lives of 23 persons.

It also provides crime laboratory examination, evaluation and identification of physical evidence gathered at the crime scene with primary emphasis on medical, biological and physical nature. * PNP Anti-Kidnapping Group (PNP-AKG). This Group serves as the primary unit of the PNP in addressing kidnapping menace in the country and in handling hostage situations. And * PNP Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP- ACG). This Group is responsible for the implementation of pertinent laws on cybercrimes and anti- cybercrime campaigns of the PNP. = Poland = Border Guard (left) walk alongside law enforcement colleagues from the Polish Customs Service. Law enforcement agencies in Poland include: * Policja (police) * Stra≈º Graniczna (SG) (border guard), also have coast guard department. * Agencja Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa Wewnƒôtrznego (ABW) ‚Äì counterintelligence agency for internal security tasks * ≈ªandarmeria Wojskowa (≈ªW) (military police, military provost) *Centralne Biuro Antykorupcyjne (CBA) ‚Äì law enforcement agency designed to fight against corruption *Prokuratura ‚Äì Polish public prosecutor office (chief section of the Prokuratura is Prokuratura Generalna) *S≈Çu≈ºba Celna ‚Äì Poland's customs *Stra≈º miejska City Guard = Portugal = There are three main police forces in Portugal: # Pol√≠cia de Seguran√ßa P√∫blica (PSP ‚Äì Public Security Police) ‚Äì a civil uniformed police, responsible mainly for the policing in the large urban areas; # Guarda Nacional Republicana (GNR ‚Äì Republican National Guard) ‚Äì a gendarmerie type force, that works mainly in the countryside and small towns; # Pol√≠cia Judici√°ria (PJ ‚Äì Judiciary Police) ‚Äì responsible for the major criminal investigations. There are also other smaller specialized police services, like the Autoridade de Seguran√ßa Alimentar e Econ√≥mica (ASAE ‚Äì Food and Economic Safety Authority), the Pol√≠cia Mar√≠tima (Maritime Police), the Servi√ßo de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras (SEF ‚Äì Foreign and Border Service) and the pol√≠cias municipais (municipal police). = Romania = General Inspectorate of Romanian Police is the central unit of police in Romania, which manages, guides, supports and controls the activity of the Romanian police units, investigates and analyses very serious crimes related to organized crime, economic, financial or banking criminality, or to other crimes which make the object of the criminal cases investigated by the Prosecutor‚Äôs Office attached to the High Court of Cassation and Justice, and which has any other attributions assigned by law. The organizational chart of General Inspectorate of Romanian Police includes general directorates, directorates, services and, offices established by the order of the Minister of Administration and Interior. The General Inspectorate is under the command of a General Inspector appointed by the Minister of Administration and Interior. Since March 2015, the General Inspector of the Police is appointed by the Prime Minister and also holds the rank of Secretary of State. = Russia = Russian police vehicle in Moscow The police in Russia are called –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ü–∏—è (Politsiya). The Police is operating under MVD, and currently the police is under wide reform. Until 2011 the police was called –º–∏–ª–∏—Ü–∏—è (Militsiya). This change of name started at the Russian Revolution via a Communist political idea of \\"replacing the capitalist police by a people's militia\\"; but the name \\"militsiya\\" has persisted after the Communist system collapsed. The standard Russian police baton is made of rubber. The normal service uniform is black with red piping and hat band. Fur hats and heavy greatcoats are worn in winter. = Serbia = The Police of the Republic of Serbia is responsible for all local and national law enforcement services in Serbia. It is managed by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. = Singapore = The Singapore Police Force (SPF) is the main agency tasked with maintaining law and order in the city-state. Formerly known as the Republic of Singapore Police. = Slovenia = police helicopter used by the Slovenian National Police. Law enforcement in Slovenia is the responsibility of the Slovenian National Police force, which is composed of 11 police directorates. = South Africa = The South African Police Service is responsible for providing policing services to the public of South Africa at 1115 police stations, divided across nine provinces. = South Korea = National Police Agency undergoing weapons training. The National Police Agency, or NPA, is the only police organization in South Korea and is run under the Ministry of the Interior and Safety. As a national police force it provides all policing services throughout the country. This differs from the situation in many countries including France, where policing is split between the National Police and Gendarmerie, and between countries such as the United States which have a layered system of National, State/Regional and/or local Law Enforcement organizations. The NPA is headquartered in Seoul and is divided into 14 local police agencies, including the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency. Local police agencies are not independent of the national police. There were 96,000 police officers = Spain = Policing in Spain is carried out by a combination of national, regional and local bodies. = Sri Lanka = The national police service in Sri Lanka is Sri Lanka Police. The elite Police Counter-Terrorist force the Special Task Force has taken security duties around the island. = Sweden = Members of the Swedish Police Authority's National Task Force. The Swedish Police Authority (in Swedish: Polismyndigheten, but is usually referred to as Polisen) is the central administrative authority responsible for the Swedish police that operates under the Ministry of Justice. The Swedish Police Authority replaced the National Police Board in 2015. Due to the 2015 reform of the police, the Swedish Security Service became a separate entity under the Ministry of Justice, instead of previously being part of the National Police Board. The reform also resulted in Rikskriminalpolisen (National Criminal Investigations Department) being dissolved and its duties transferred to the National Operations Department. The 21 police regions that were established according to the Counties of Sweden prior to the reform were replaced by six police regions, which were instead divided into 27 local police districts. Swedish police officers are always armed with a 9 mm Sig Sauer handgun, a telescopic baton and a can of pepper spray. The Swedish Police Authority maintains three well-trained SWAT elements, the first being the elite counter-terrorism National Task Force which is the equivalent of Germany's GSG 9 and the French GIGN. The second unit being the Reinforced Regional Task Force (previously known as Piketen), which is trained to handle riot control, hostage situations and high-risk arrests in three of Sweden's major cities; Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malm√∂. The third element is composed of small, less well-equipped special response units under the jurisdictions of their respective local police districts, they are simply called Regional Task Forces, and they serve officially under the Reinforced Regional Task Force. = Switzerland = The police in Switzerland is mainly the responsibility of the 26 cantons, although both federal and local police forces also exist. =Taiwan (Republic of China)= Officers from Chiayi Police on police motorcycles. The Taiwanese police is a national police force. It has an elite Special Forces unit known as the Thunder Squad. It is trained for dealing with dangerous and high-risk missions, as well as counter-terrorism due to the potential military threat from the People's Republic of China. = Thailand = The Royal Thai Police are subdivided into several regions and services, each enjoying their own powers. * Crime Suppression Division, Thai FBI * Immigration * Traffic police = Turkey = A Turkish National Police water cannon during the Gezi Park protests. Law enforcement is Turkey is carried out by five separate bodies. The Turkish National Police () is the civilian police, under the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The Gendarmerie () is a branch of the Turkish Armed Forces responsible only for policing the civilian population. Provost services are provided by the Military Police (). The Turkish Coast Guard () is also branch of the Armed Forces, responsible for search and rescue and maritime border protection. The National Intelligence Organization () is responsible for internal security. Some limited local law enforcement is carried out by village guards. = Vietnam = The single law enforcement in Vietnam is called the Vietnam People's Public Security, which answers to the Ministry of Public Security. = United Arab Emirates = Two supercars operated by the Dubai Police Force of the United Arab Emirates. Law enforcement in the United Arab Emirates is divided between regionally with each Emirate having its own independent police force. For example, the Abu Dhabi Police has jurisdiction within the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. = United Kingdom = Widely regarded as the home of the first modern police force, law enforcement in the United Kingdom is based on the long-standing philosophy of policing by consent. Policing and law enforcement are organised separately in each of the legal systems of the United Kingdom as a result of devolution of powers to Scotland, Northern Ireland and, to a lesser extent, London. England and Wales have 43 local police forces (formerly known as constabularies), each of which covers a 'police area' (a particular county, grouping of counties or metropolitan area). Since 2012, 41 of these forces have their own directly elected Police and Crime Commissioner, under the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011. The two exceptions are in London, where the Metropolitan Police is accountable to the directly elected mayor via the Office for Policing and Crime, and the much smaller City of London Police that retains the Common Council of the City as its police authority. Police Scotland officers without firearms. Most British law enforcement officers do not carry a firearm. Scotland now has a single national force ‚Äì the Police Service of Scotland (Scottish Gaelic: Seirbheis Phoilis na h-Alba), commonly known as Police Scotland. It replaced eight former territorial police forces and the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency in April 2013 and is overseen by the Scottish Police Authority, under the terms of the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (Irish: Seirbh√≠s P√≥il√≠neachta Thuaisceart √âireann, Ulster Scots: Polis Servis o Norlin Airlan) serves Northern Ireland, succeeding the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in 2001. Following the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000, the PSNI is supervised by the Northern Ireland Policing Board (Irish: Bord P√≥il√≠neachta Thuaisceart √âireann, Ulster-Scots: Norlin Airlan Polisin Boord), who are themselves appointed since 2007 by the Minister of Justice (Northern Ireland) using the Nolan principles for public appointments. From October 2013 the National Crime Agency (NCA) operates as the United Kingdom's first national law enforcement agency. Replacing the existing Serious Organised Crime Agency and Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, as well as assuming some of the responsibilities of the UK Border Agency, but not counter-terrorism, for the first time it will have authority for \\"tasking and coordination\\" investigative work to local forces under the Crime and Courts Act 2013. The Ministry of Defence Police is one of three special police forces that have a specific, non-regional jurisdiction of enforcement. There are also three special police forces that have a specific, non-regional jurisdiction ‚Äì the British Transport Police, Civil Nuclear Constabulary, Ministry of Defence Police. Over the centuries there has been a wide variation in the number of police forces operating within the UK, most of which now no longer exist, see list of former police forces in the United Kingdom. A few miscellaneous constabularies with responsibility mostly founded on old legislation to police specific local areas, such as ports and parks, have escaped police reform. Lastly, a number of government bodies that are not police forces have detective powers and enforce laws, such as the Marine and Fisheries Agency and UK Border Agency, who employ officers with limited powers of detention and search but generally cannot make full arrests. The majority of British police are never routinely armed with firearms, relying on an extendable baton and in some cases Tasers, with specialist armed units always on patrol and called in only when necessary. The exceptions are the Ministry of Defence Police, the Civil Nuclear Constabulary and the Police Service of Northern Ireland which are routinely armed. Uniquely in Britain, there are police forces of Crown Dependencies such as the Isle of Man and States of Jersey and Guernsey, who have police forces that share resources with the UK police, whilst having a separate administration within their own governments. The British Overseas Territories, have their own police forces which are generally based on the British model of policing. = United States = American officers from municipal, state, and federal law enforcement services. In the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other federal agencies such as the United States Secret Service, US Marshals, United States Park Police, United States Capitol Police, and the United States Pentagon Police are limited to the enforcement of federal laws and usually specialize in certain crimes or duties, but do enforce some state laws. Most crimes constitutionally fall under the jurisdiction of state police or the thousands of local police forces. These include county police or sheriff's departments as well as municipal or city police forces. Many areas also have special agencies such as campus police, railroad police, housing police, or a district or precinct constable.

History Interior of a franchise location in Fairfax County, Virginia =Pizza Outlet= The chain was founded in Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania near Pittsburgh in 1988 as Pizza Outlet. What was simply a local pizza shop quickly expanded in the Pittsburgh Tri-State region during the 1990s. During this time, their slogan was \\"Delivering Great Taste to Your Door\\". They also briefly used \\"The Taste that SCREAMS Fresh!\\" as well before reverting to their old slogan. Pizza Outlet was widely regarded as an affordable option for college students on a budget, especially among University of Pittsburgh students in the dorm towers. This era is remembered for featuring wrestler Kurt Angle in a commercial featuring two CGI-animated pizza toppings that the chain had been using as mascots at the time wrestling each other on top of a pizza Angle had just ordered. The Rock later poked fun at Angle and the commercial on an episode of WWE Raw is War in Angle's hometown after Angle had established himself in the WWE. =Change to Vocelli= Exterior of a location in Fairfax County, Virginia After experiencing fast growth throughout the 1990s in its home market, the chain entered select markets in the Southern United States. However, the chain initially wasn't as successful. Instead of withdrawing from these markets to focus on the more successful (and more competitive) Pittsburgh market, Pizza Outlet instead changed the name of their Southern locations to Vocelli Pizza in 2002, and adopting an Italian theme in the restaurant in the process. Previously, the Pizza Outlet locations had no specific theme inside each location. Despite the changes, the product itself remained the same. Nevertheless, sales at the Southern stores skyrocketed after the change. So much so, that the company reverted plans to keep the Pizza Outlet name in Pittsburgh and the remaining Pizza Outlet stores were rebranded as Vocelli Pizza in 2003.Scott-based Pizza Outlet is suddenly Vocelli Pizza The company also cited the name change as to be more classy compared to the generic- sounding Pizza Outlet.

In addition to active backpropagation of the action potential, there is also passive electrotonic spread. While there is ample evidence to prove the existence of backpropagating action potentials, the function of such action potentials and the extent to which they invade the most distal dendrites remains highly controversial. Mechanism Methods of neural backpropagation. Left: action potential forms in axon and travels towards soma. Right: Regular action potential generates an echo that backpropagates through the dendritic tree. When the graded excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) depolarize the soma to spike threshold at the axon hillock, first, the axon experiences a propagating impulse through the electrical properties of its voltage-gated sodium and voltage-gated potassium channels. An action potential occurs in the axon first as research illustrates that sodium channels at the dendrites exhibit a higher threshold than those on the membrane of the axon (Rapp et al., 1996). Moreover, the voltage-gated sodium channels on the dendritic membranes having a higher threshold helps prevent them triggering an action potential from synaptic input. Instead, only when the soma depolarizes enough from accumulating graded potentials and firing an axonal action potential will these channels be activated to propagate a signal traveling backwards (Rapp et al. 1996). Generally, EPSPs from synaptic activation are not large enough to activate the dendritic voltage-gated calcium channels (usually on the order of a couple milliamperes each) so backpropagation is typically believed to happen only when the cell is activated to fire an action potential. These sodium channels on the dendrites are abundant in certain types of neurons, especially mitral and pyramidal cells, and quickly inactivate. Initially, it was thought that an action potential could only travel down the axon in one direction towards the axon terminal where it ultimately signaled the release of neurotransmitters. However, recent research has provided evidence for the existence of backwards propagating action potentials (Staley 2004). This diagram displays how the dendritic voltage spike comes after the depolarization of the axon and soma. To elaborate, neural backpropagation can occur in one of two ways. First, during the initiation of an axonal action potential, the cell body, or soma, can become depolarized as well. This depolarization can spread through the cell body towards the dendritic tree where there are voltage-gated sodium channels. The depolarization of these voltage-gated sodium channels can then result in the propagation of a dendritic action potential. Such backpropagation is sometimes referred to as an echo of the forward propagating action potential (Staley 2004). It has also been shown that an action potential initiated in the axon can create a retrograde signal that travels in the opposite direction (Hausser 2000). This impulse travels up the axon eventually causing the cell body to become depolarized, thus triggering the dendritic voltage-gated calcium channels. As described in the first process, the triggering of dendritic voltage-gated calcium channels leads to the propagation of a dendritic action potential. It is important to note that the strength of backpropagating action potentials varies greatly between different neuronal types (Hausser 2000). Some types of neuronal cells show little to no decrease in the amplitude of action potentials as they invade and travel through the dendritic tree while other neuronal cell types, such as cerebellar Purkinje neurons, exhibit very little action potential backpropagation (Stuart 1997). Additionally, there are other neuronal cell types that manifest varying degrees of amplitude decrement during backpropagation. It is thought that this is due to the fact that each neuronal cell type contains varying numbers of the voltage-gated channels required to propagate a dendritic action potential. Regulation and inhibition Generally, synaptic signals that are received by the dendrite are combined in the soma in order to generate an action potential that is then transmitted down the axon toward the next synaptic contact. Thus, the backpropagation of action potentials poses a threat to initiate an uncontrolled positive feedback loop between the soma and the dendrites. For example, as an action potential was triggered, its dendritic echo could enter the dendrite and potentially trigger a second action potential. If left unchecked, an endless cycle of action potentials triggered by their own echo would be created. In order to prevent such a cycle, most neurons have a relatively high density of A-type K+ channels. A-type K+ channels belong to the superfamily of voltage-gated ion channels and are transmembrane channels that help maintain the cell's membrane potential (Cai 2007). Typically, they play a crucial role in returning the cell to its resting membrane following an action potential by allowing an inhibitory current of K+ ions to quickly flow out of the neuron. The presence of these channels in such high density in the dendrites explains their inability to initiate an action potential, even during synaptic input. Additionally, the presence of these channels provides a mechanism by which the neuron can suppress and regulate the backpropagation of action potentials through the dendrite (Vetter 2000). Pharmacological antagonists of these channels promoted the frequency of backpropagating action potentials which demonstrates their importance in keeping the cell from excessive firing (Waters et al., 2004). Results have indicated a linear increase in the density of A-type channels with increasing distance into the dendrite away from the soma. The increase in the density of A-type channels results in a dampening of the backpropagating action potential as it travels into the dendrite. Essentially, inhibition occurs because the A-type channels facilitate the outflow of K+ ions in order to maintain the membrane potential below threshold levels (Cai 2007). Such inhibition limits EPSP and protects the neuron from entering a never-ending positive-positive feedback loop between the soma and the dendrites. History Since the 1950s, evidence has existed that neurons in the central nervous system generate an action potential, or voltage spike, that travels both through the axon to signal the next neuron and backpropagates through the dendrites sending a retrograde signal to its presynaptic signaling neurons. This current decays significantly with travel length along the dendrites, so effects are predicted to be more significant for neurons whose synapses are near the postsynaptic cell body, with magnitude depending mainly on sodium-channel density in the dendrite. It is also dependent on the shape of the dendritic tree and, more importantly, on the rate of signal currents to the neuron. On average, a backpropagating spike loses about half its voltage after traveling nearly 500 micrometres. Backpropagation occurs actively in the neocortex, hippocampus, substantia nigra, and spinal cord, while in the cerebellum it occurs relatively passively. This is consistent with observations that synaptic plasticity is much more apparent in areas like the hippocampus, which controls spatial memory, than the cerebellum, which controls more unconscious and vegetative functions. The backpropagating current also causes a voltage change that increases the concentration of Ca2+ in the dendrites, an event which coincides with certain models of synaptic plasticity. This change also affects future integration of signals, leading to at least a short-term response difference between the presynaptic signals and the postsynaptic spike. Functions While many questions have yet to be answered in regards to neural backpropagation, there exists a number of hypotheses regarding its function. Some proposed function include involvement in synaptic plasticity, involvement in dendrodendritic inhibition, boosting synaptic responses, resetting membrane potential, retrograde actions at synapses and conditional axonal output. Backpropagation is believed to help form LTP (long term potentiation) and Hebbian plasticity at hippocampal synapses. Since artificial LTP induction, using microelectrode stimulation, voltage clamp, etc. requires the postsynaptic cell to be slightly depolarized when EPSPs are elicited, backpropagation can serve as the means of depolarization of the postsynaptic cell. Backpropagating action potentials can induce Long-term potentiation by behaving as a signal that informs the presynaptic cell that the postsynaptic cell has fired. Moreover, Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity is known as the narrow time frame for which coincidental firing of both the pre and post synaptic neurons will induce plasticity. Neural backpropagation occurs in this window to interact with NMDA receptors at the apical dendrites by assisting in the removal of voltage sensitive Mg2+ block (Waters et al., 2004). This process permits the large influx of calcium which provokes a cascade of events to cause potentiation. Current literature also suggests that backpropagating action potentials are also responsible for the release of retrograde neurotransmitters and trophic factors which contribute to the short-term and long-term efficacy between two neurons. Since the backpropagating action potentials essentially exhibit a copy of the neurons axonal firing pattern, they help establish a synchrony between the pre and post synaptic neurons (Waters et al., 2004). Importantly, backpropagating action potentials are necessary for the release of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). BDNF is an essential component for inducing synaptic plasticity and development (Kuczewski N., Porcher C., Ferrand N., 2008). Moreover, backpropagating action potentials have been shown to induce BDNF-dependent phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) which is known to be a major component in synaptic plasticity and memory formation (Kuczewski N., Porcher C., Lessmann V., et al. 2008). Algorithm While a backpropagating action potential can presumably cause changes in the weight of the presynaptic connections, there is no simple mechanism for an error signal to propagate through multiple layers of neurons, as in the computer backpropagation algorithm. However, simple linear topologies have shown that effective computation is possible through signal backpropagation in this biological sense.  References  #   Vetter P, et al.

Rafael Ramirez de Arellano in Boletin de la Real academia de la Historia, xli, pt. iv (1902)) was a traveller, historian and writer from Castile (modern day Spain). Born in C√≥rdoba,He found it expedient to tell the Sultan's chief interpreter at Cairo that he had been born in a less sensitive site, Seville. to a branch of the noble house of Guzm√°n,He dedicated his manuscript to Don Fernando de Guzm√°n, Chief Commander of the Order of Calatrava, \\"being of your house and lineage,\\". Tafur traveled across three continents during the years 1436 to 1439. During the voyage, he participated in various battles, visited shrines, and rendered diplomatic services for Juan II of Castile. He visited the Moroccan coast, southern France, the Holy Land, Egypt, Rhodes, Cyprus, Tenedos, Trebizond, Caffa, and Constantinople. He also visited the Sinai Peninsula, where he met Niccol√≤ Da Conti, who shared with Tafur information about southeastern Asia. Before returning to Spain, Tafur crossed central Europe and Italy. Between 1453 and 1454, to judge from interior evidence in the single surviving manuscript, he wrote a book called Andan√ßas e viajes de Pero Tafur por diversas partes del mundo avidos (Avid Adventures and Travels of Pero Tafur to Various Parts of the World). But it didn't appear in print until 1874, when it was published by Marcos Jim√©nez de la Espada. This work is one of the few books written by a Spanish traveler during the medieval period (that of Ruy Gonz√°lez de Clavijo is another example). Tafur dedicates his book to a member of the Guzm√°n family, the same family to which Saint Dominic belonged. He thus provides biographical information regarding this saint. He also provides valuable details concerning the Baths of Zeuxippus, the Hagia Sophia, the Holy doors in Rome, and the obelisks in Rome. Having returned to Spain in 1439, some time before 1452 Tafur married Do√±a Juana de Horozco. A son appears to have predeceased his father, but three daughters are mentioned in Do√±a Juana's will. He played a prominent role in local affairs: he and his son both held office as aldermen in 1479.

It was one of those very rare watermills that was an overdrift mill, with the millstones driven from above. This arrangement is more commonly found in windmills. When Bewl Water was built, the fourteenth century Mill House was dismantled and re-erected at Three Legged Cross, Wadhurst. The overshot waterwheel was some diameter by wide and was carried on a wooden axle. it drove a cast iron pit wheel diameter with 112 wooden cogs.

JREAP takes the message from the format it was originally formatted in and changes the protocol so that the message can be transmitted over Beyond Line-of Sight media. JREAP is the protocol and message structure for the transmission and reception of pre-formatted messages over communications media other than those for which these messages were designed. JREAP provides a foundation for Joint Range Extension (JRE) of Link 16 and other tactical data links to overcome the line-of-sight limitations of radio terminals such as the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) and Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS), and extends coverage of these data links through the use of long-haul media.  Versions  ;JREAP A :JREAP A uses an Announced Token Passing protocol for half-duplex communications. This protocol may be used when several terminals share the same JRE media and take turns transmitting or in a broadcast situation when one transmits and the rest receive. It is targeted to data rates down to 2400 bits per second (bps) on a serial data interface with a TSEC/KG-84A/KIV-7 or a compatible encryption device used for data security. It is designed for use with media such as: 25-kHz UHF TDMA/DAMA SATCOM, EHF Low Data Rate (LDR) Forced Mode Network Operations and 5 and 25 kHz UHF non-DAMA SATCOM. ;JREAP B :JREAP B is a synchronous or asynchronous point-to-point mode of the JREAP. This mode is similar in design to the Half-Duplex Announced Token Passing protocol used by JREAP A. This mode can be used with SHF and EHF LDR point-to- point mode synchronous connections, STU-III operations via phone lines and other point-to-point media connections. This JREAP application presumes full- duplex data-transparent communication media. ;JREAP C :JREAP C makes use of the Internet Protocol (IP) in conjunction with either the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) or Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).

History Takanabe was previously called Kushima; it was granted to Akizuki Tanezane by Toyotomi Hideyoshi after Tanezane's surrender during the subjugation of Kyushu in the late 1580s. Akizuki Tanezane retained control of the fief after the Battle of Sekigahara, as he had been on the side of Ishida Mitsunari but switched allegiances while in ≈ågaki Castle, killing the Western Army's commanders there and opening the castle to the Eastern Army. In 1604 Tanezane moved his residence to Takanabe Castle; the domain became formally known as Takanabe 69 years later, in 1674. The domain's income rating was 30,000 koku until 1689, when the 4th generation lord, Akizuki Tanemasa, granted 3000 koku to his younger brother; Takanabe's income remained at 27,000 koku for the remainder of its history.

Biography O'Brien joined the Army from his birth city of Troy, New York, and by June 20, 1944 was serving as a lieutenant colonel in the 1st Battalion, 105th Infantry Regiment, 27th Infantry Division. On that day, on Saipan in the Marianas Islands, he braved enemy fire to reach several American tanks which were unknowingly firing on their own troops. The next week, on June 28, he oversaw and personally led an attack on a Japanese held ridge. On July 7 his battalion came under attack from a much larger enemy force, the largest banzai charge of the Pacific War. He refused to leave the front lines even after being wounded and continued to rally his men until being overrun and killed. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor on May 9, 1945, for his actions throughout the battle for Saipan.

Two species, Cimex lectularius and Cimex hemipterus, are known as bed bugs and frequently feed on humans, although other species may parasitize humans opportunistically. Species that primarily parasitize bats are known as bat bugs. The insects are long and have flattened reddish-brown bodies with small nonfunctional wings.  Description  An adult bed bug (Cimex lectularius) Adult Cimex are light brown to reddish-brown, flat and oval. The mouthparts are beak-like, and adapted for piercing and sucking. Following a blood meal the abdomen is plump and darker in colour. The front wings are vestigial and reduced to pad-like structures and there are no hind wings. Cimex have segmented abdomens with microscopic hairs that give them a banded appearance. Adults grow to long. The different species are very similar in morphology and can only be separated by microscopic examination. Sexual dimorphism occurs in C. lectularius, with the females larger in size than the males on average. The abdomens of the sexes differ in that the males appear to have \\"pointed\\" abdomens, which are actually their copulatory organs, while females have more rounded abdomens. Newly hatched nymphs are translucent, light in color at first, becoming browner as they moult and approach maturity. A Cimex nymph of any age that has just consumed a blood meal has a bright red, translucent abdomen, fading to brown over the next several hours, and to opaque black within two days as the insect digests its meal. Cimex may be mistaken for other insects, such as booklice, small cockroaches, or carpet beetles; however, when warm and active, their movements are more ant-like, and like most other true bugs, they emit a characteristic disagreeable odor when crushed. Cimex use pheromones and kairomones to communicate regarding nesting locations, feeding, and reproduction. The lifespan of Cimex varies by species and is also dependent on feeding.

Below , adults enter semihibernation and can survive longer; they can survive for at least five days at , but die after 15 minutes of exposure to . Common commercial and residential freezers reach temperatures low enough to kill most life stages of bed bug, with 95% mortality after 3 days at . They show high desiccation tolerance, surviving low humidity and a 35‚Äì40 ¬∞C range even with loss of one- third of body weight; earlier life stages are more susceptible to drying out than later ones. The thermal death point for C. lectularius is ; all stages of life are killed by 7 minutes of exposure to . Bed bugs apparently cannot survive high concentrations of carbon dioxide for very long; exposure to nearly pure nitrogen atmospheres, however, appears to have relatively little effect even after 72 hours. (abstracted from a poster presentation in Prague, 19‚Äì22 Jul) Household insecticides often do not have a prolonged effect on the bug population. Professional pest control experts may use potentially harmful substances such as chlorpyrifos.  Feeding habits  Scanning electron micrograph (SEM) digitally colorized with skin-piercing mouthparts highlighted in purple and red Cimex are obligatory hematophagous (bloodsucking) insects. Most species feed on humans only when other prey are unavailable. They obtain all the additional moisture they need from water vapor in the surrounding air. Cimex are attracted to their hosts primarily by carbon dioxide, secondarily by warmth, and also by certain chemicals. Bed bugs prefer exposed skin, preferably the face, neck, and arms of a sleeping person. Bed bugs have mouth parts that saw through the skin, and inject saliva with anticoagulants and painkillers. Sensitivity of humans varies from extreme allergic reaction to no reaction at all (about 20%). The bite usually produces a swelling with no red spot, but when many bugs feed on a small area, reddish spots may appear after the swelling subsides. The bite marks may appear in a straight line.How do I know if I‚Äôve been bitten by a bed bug?, In: cdc.gov/parasites Although under certain cool conditions adult Cimex can live for over a year without feeding, under typically warm conditions they try to feed at five- to ten-day intervals, and adults can survive for about five months without food. Younger instars cannot survive nearly as long, though even the vulnerable newly hatched first instars can survive for weeks without taking a blood meal. At the 57th annual meeting of the Entomological Society of America in 2009, newer generations of pesticide-resistant C. lectularius in Virginia were reported to survive only two months without feeding. citing DNA from human blood meals can be recovered from Cimex for up to 90 days, which means they can be used for forensic purposes in identifying on whom the bed bugs have fed. = Feeding physiology = Rostrum tip Cimex pierces the skin of its host with a stylet fascicle, rostrum, or \\"beak\\". The rostrum is composed of the maxillae and mandibles, which have been modified into elongated shapes from a basic, ancestral style. The right and left maxillary stylets are connected at their midline and a section at the centerline forms a large food canal and a smaller salivary canal. The entire maxillary and mandibular bundle penetrates the skin. The tips of the right and left maxillary stylets are not the same; the right is hook-like and curved, and the left is straight. The right and left mandibular stylets extend along the outer sides of their respective maxillary stylets and do not reach anywhere near the tip of the fused maxillary stylets. The stylets are retained in a groove in the labium, and during feeding, they are freed from the groove as the jointed labium is bent or folded out of the way; its tip never enters the wound. The mandibular stylet tips have small teeth, and through alternately moving these stylets back and forth, the insect cuts a path through tissue for the maxillary bundle to reach an appropriately sized blood vessel. Pressure from the blood vessel itself fills the insect with blood in three to five minutes. The bug then withdraws the stylet bundle from the feeding position and retracts it back into the labial groove, folds the entire unit back under the head, and returns to its hiding place. It takes between five and ten minutes for a Cimex to become completely engorged with blood. In all, the insect may spend less than 20 minutes in physical contact with its host, and does not try to feed again until it has either completed a moult or, if an adult, has thoroughly digested the meal.  Reproduction  traumatically inseminating a female Since males are attracted to large body size, any Cimex with a recent blood meal can be seen as a potential mate. However, males will mount unfed, flat females on occasion. The female is able to curl her abdomen forward and underneath toward the head to deter the male if she does not wish to mate. Males are generally unable to discriminate between the sexes until after mounting, but can do so before insemination. North Carolina State University found that bed bugs in contrast to most other insects tolerate incest and are able to genetically withstand the effects of inbreeding quite well. Male bed bugs sometimes attempt to mate with other males and pierce their abdomens.\\"This Bedbug's Life\\", The New York Times, 7 August 2010. This behaviour occurs because sexual attraction in bed bugs is based primarily on size, and males mount any freshly fed partner regardless of sex. All Cimex mate by traumatic insemination.Carayon, J. 1959 Ins√©mination par \\"spermal√®ge\\" et cordon conducteur de spermatozoids chez Stricticimex brevispinosus Usinger (Heteroptera, Cimicidae). Rev. Zool. Bot. Afr. 60, 81‚Äì104. Female Cimex possess a reproductive tract that functions during oviposition, but the male does not use this tract for sperm insemination. Instead, the male pierces the female's abdomen with his hypodermic penis and ejaculates into the body cavity. In all bed bug species except Primicimex cavernis, sperm are injected into the mesospermalege, a component of the spermalege, a secondary genital structure that reduces the wounding and immunological costs of traumatic insemination. Injected sperm travel via the haemolymph (blood) to sperm storage structures called seminal conceptacles, with fertilisation eventually taking place at the ovaries. The \\"Cimex alarm pheromone\\" consists of (E)-2-octenal and (E)-2-hexenal. It is released when the insect is disturbed, as during an attack by a predator. A 2009 study demonstrated the alarm pheromone is also released by male Cimex to repel other males that attempt to mate with them. C. lectularius and C. hemipterus mate with each other given the opportunity, but the eggs then produced are usually sterile. In a 1988 study, one of 479 eggs was fertile and resulted in a hybrid, Cimex hemipterus √ó lectularius. = Sperm protection = Cimex lectularius males have environmental microbes on their genitals. These microbes damage sperm cells, leaving them unable to fertilize female gametes. Due to these dangerous microbes, males have evolved antimicrobial ejaculate substances that prevent sperm damage. When the microbes contact sperm or the male genitals, the bed bug releases antimicrobial substances. Many species of these microbes live in the bodies of females after mating. The microbes can cause infections in the females. It has been suggested that females receive benefit from the ejaculate. Although the benefit is not direct, females are able to produce more eggs than optimum increasing the amount of the females' genes in the gene pool. = Sperm and seminal fluid allocation = In organisms, sexual selection extends past differential reproduction to affect sperm composition, sperm competition, and ejaculate size. Males of C. lectularius allocate 12% of their sperm and 19% of their seminal fluid per mating. Due to these findings, Reinhard et al. proposed that multiple mating is limited by seminal fluid and not sperm. After measuring ejaculate volume, mating rate and estimating sperm density, Reinhardt et al. showed that mating could be limited by seminal fluid. Despite these advances, the cost difference between ejaculate-dose dependence and mating frequency dependence have not been explored. = Egg production = Males fertilize females only by traumatic insemination into the structure called the ectospermalege (the organ of Berlese, however the organ of Ribaga, as it was first named, was first designated as an organ of stridulation. These two names are not descriptive, so other terminologies are used). On fertilization, the female's ovaries finish developing, which suggests that sperm plays a role other than fertilizing the egg. Fertilization also allows for egg production through the corpus allatum. Sperm remains viable in a female's spermathecae (a better term is conceptacle), a sperm-carrying sack, for a long period of time as long as body temperature is optimum. The female lays fertilized eggs until she depletes the sperm found in her conceptacle. After the depletion of sperm, she lays a few sterile eggs. The number of eggs a C. lectularius female produces does not depend on the sperm she harbors, but on the female's nutritional level. = Alarm pheromones = In C. lectularius, males sometimes mount other males because male sexual interest is directed at any recently fed individual regardless of their sex, but unfed females may also be mounted. Traumatic insemination is the only way for copulation to occur in Cimex. Females have evolved the spermalege to protect themselves from wounding and infection. Because males lack this organ, traumatic insemination could leave them badly injured. For this reason, males have evolved alarm pheromones to signal their sex to other males. If a male C. lectularius mounts another male, the mounted male releases the pheromone signal and the male on top stops before insemination. Females are capable of producing alarm pheromones to avoid multiple mating, but they generally do not do so. Two reasons are proposed as to why females do not release alarm pheromones to protect themselves. First, alarm pheromone production is costly. Due to egg production, females may refrain from spending additional energy on alarm pheromones. The second proposed reason is that releasing the alarm pheromone reduces the benefits associated with multiple mating. Benefits of multiple mating include material benefits, better quality nourishment or more nourishment, genetic benefits including increased fitness of offspring, and finally, the cost of resistance may be higher than the benefit of consent‚Äîwhich appears the case in C. lectularius.Davies, Nicholas B.; Krebs, John R.; West, Stuart A. (17 February 2012). An Introduction to Behavioural Ecology (Kindle Locations 5432-5434). Wiley. Kindle Edition.  Life stages  Bed bugs have five immature nymph life stages and a final sexually mature adult stage. They shed their skins through ecdysis at each stage, discarding their outer exoskeleton, which is somewhat clear, empty exoskeletons of the bugs themselves. Cimex must molt six times before becoming fertile adults, and must consume at least one blood meal to complete each molt. Each of the immature stages lasts about a week, depending on temperature and the availability of food, and the complete lifecycle can be completed in as little as two months (rather long compared to other ectoparasites). Fertilized females with enough food lay three to four eggs each day continually until the end of their lifespans (about nine months under warm conditions), possibly generating as many as 500 eggs in this time. Genetic analysis has shown that a single pregnant Cimex, possibly a single survivor of eradication, can be responsible for an entire infestation over a matter of weeks, rapidly producing generations of offspring.

When a Cimex is starved, it leaves its shelter and searches for a host. If it successfully feeds, it returns to its shelter; otherwise, it continues to search for a host. After searching‚Äîregardless of whether or not it has eaten‚Äîthe Cimex returns to the shelter to aggregate before the photophase (period of light during a day-night cycle). Reis argues that two reasons explain why C. lectularius would return to its shelter and aggregate after feeding. One is to find a mate and the other is to find shelter to avoid getting smashed after eating.  Aggregation and dispersal behavior  Cimex lectularius aggregates under all life stages and mating conditions. Cimex may choose to aggregate because of predation, resistance to desiccation, and more opportunities to find a mate. Airborne pheromones are responsible for aggregations. Another source of aggregation could be the recognition of other C. lectularius bugs through mechanoreceptors located on their antennae. Aggregations are formed and disbanded based on the associated cost and benefits. Females are more often found separate from the aggregation than males. Females are more likely to expand the population range and find new sites. Active female dispersal can account for treatment failures. Males, when found in areas with few females, abandon an aggregation to find a new mate. The males excrete an aggregation pheromone into the air that attracts virgin females and arrests other males.

Haas's monumental fiberglass sculpture Winter (after Arcimboldo) was unveiled in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in September, 2010, before traveling in 2011 to the Piazza del Duomo in Milan and the Garden of Versailles. In 2012, in a spectacular transformation that is typical of his work, Haas created a group of large-scale, fifteen-foot-high, fibre-glass sculptures, inspired by Giuseppe Arcimboldo's Renaissance paintings of the four seasons, comprising Spring, Summer, Autumn, and including Winter. The colossal size of Haas's sculpture accentuates the visual puzzle of natural forms‚Äîflowers, ivy, moss, fungi, vegetables, fruit, trees, bark, branches, twigs, leaves‚Äîas they are recycled to form four human portraits, each representing an individual season. The result is at once earthy, fanciful and exuberant‚Äîa commentary on Arcimboldo's style and a work of art in its own right. These sculptures were first seen in the garden of the Dulwich Picture Gallery in the United Kingdom in the summer of 2012, before embarking on a three-year tour of American museums and botanical gardens.

On her quarterdeck were fourteen 32-pounder (42 cwt) cannon and on the forecastle deck were eight more 32-pounder (42 cwt) cannon. Construction and career Officer on board Superb, 1845 Superb was ordered from Pembroke Dockyard on 15 June 1838 and laid down the following November. She was launched on 6 September 1842 and was towed to Plymouth for fitting out by 26 April 1845.Lavery, Vol. 1, p. 191 Her construction cost ¬£54,979 and fitting out cost an additional ¬£25,313. After commissioning, Superb joined the Channel Fleet under the command of Captain Armar Lowry Corry. In February 1845, she joined the Experimental Squadron of eight ships, four of them built by Symonds. They engaged in three competitive cruises to test Symonds‚Äô new hull designs against older, traditionally built warships. The whole Squadron was reviewed by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert at Spithead on 22 June and the trials were completed by December, Superb having proved to be the fastest ship in the last cruise. Overall, the results were inconclusive and became mired by political wrangling and professional rivalry, with the result that Symonds resigned. Superb took part in further trials the following year with yet more ships, this time called The Squadron of Evolution. The whole project was made irrelevant by the advent of steam propulsion and the Vanguard class were some of the last major Royal Navy warships to rely solely on sail propulsion. In November 1848, Superb joined the Mediterranean Fleet, and continued there until paying off into the reserve at HM Dockyard, Chatham in June 1852. Superb was broken up in 1869.

The church is also called Christ Church, Navy Yard, because of its proximity to the Washington Navy Yard and the U.S. Marine Barracks nearby (such that the neighborhood is sometimes called \\"Barracks Row\\"). Built in 1807 in Gothic Revival style, the church began as one of two parish churches of Washington Parish, which the Maryland General Assembly created in 1794. The current building, built after the American Civil War, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. History Although St. Paul's Church, Rock Creek Parish was founded in 1712 and built a church in 1775 (and remains in the District of Columbia), after the United States Congress decided to establish the new nation's capitol on the Potomac River in 1790 (effective in 1800), accepting land granted for that purpose by the state of Maryland and the Commonwealth of Virginia to form the District of Columbia, that church was far from the two population centers developing on the riverfront. In 1789, Maryland's General Assembly had granted a charter to the town of Georgetown at the falls of the Potomac River near its confluence with Rock Creek, although that port development had begun in 1759. In 1792, Thomas John Claggett was consecrated as the bishop of the Diocese of Maryland in the newly re-established Episcopal Church. In the following year, he drew the diocesan convention's attention to the distance between the Rock Creek parish and the population centers developing as the national capital was being constructed, and they appointed a 12-member vestry for establishing a parish in Washington. In December, 1794, the Maryland General Assembly formally established Washington Episcopal parish nearer the developing riverfront. Two priests were appointed, Rev. George Ralph (a teacher) for the eastern portion and Rev. Edward Gantt (M.D.) for the western portion, although no record remains of either holding services. Records do show Rev. Walter Dulaney Addison traveling from his home in Oxon Hill, Maryland to conduct services, at first at the Presbyterian Church on M Street with the permission of Rev. Stephen Balch. Soon, a vestry was established, and decided to build two churches, one at either end of the new parish, reflecting the population center at Georgetown as well as near the buildings being constructed for the capital, on the parish's eastern part.Frances Barbour Lumbard, The Changing Face of St. John's: 200 Years in Georgetown (Washington D.C. 1998) at pp. 15-40 They started raising subscriptions and held lotteries to raise funds to construct the buildings, but fundraising proved slow for each of the proposed churches, and construction stopped on the Georgetown church in 1797 with its walls half up. After disestablishment, pew rentals generally provided the parish's chief source of income. President Thomas Jefferson was a subscriber to this church, as he had for the earlier-constructed Presbyterian church, and he regularly attended services at the old tobacco warehouse church where services were held until 1807, when the present site near the Navy Yard was donated by William Prout. Finally, on successive days in 1809, bishop Claggett consecrated the two buildings used by the parish: Christ Church on the eastern portion and what was originally known as St. John's Church in Georgetown to the west (but which later became known as Christ Church Georgetown). Three free pews were regularly reserved: one for the President of the United States; one for the donor of the land, Mr. Prout; and one for the Rector's family. When the first service was held at the new site on August 9, 1807, the church was known only as the \\"New Church in the Navy Yard.\\" The U.S. Marines billeted at their nearby barracks also used the church in the early days. The vestry formally adopted the name \\"Christ Church\\" on August 20, 1807. Several early U.S. Presidents (Madison, Monroe, etc.) worshiped there. Rev. Ethan Allen was the longest serving rector in the church's early years, and helped build the church's first rectory, completed in 1824. The parish also acquired a burial ground to the east, which became Congressional Cemetery, which is the unofficial resting place for members of Congress. One of Christ Church's somewhat more recent members was John Philip Sousa, the celebrated bandmaster and march composer who lived on the same residential block. Sousa was married at Christ Church and buried in Congressional Cemetery. Architecture Although there is some controversy, Benjamin Latrobe, one of 19th-century America's greatest architects, is generally credited with the design of the present church building. It was constructed of brick in the Federal style, which was evolving into the Gothic revival style. The bell tower, added in 1849, was used as an observation post during the Civil War. The present Parish Hall was built in 1874. In 1924, the first rectory was razed and the present one was built on the same site. The Crucifixion window at the end of the chancel, a memorial to mothers, dates from 1927. In 1966, a two-story addition to the Parish Hall was constructed and dedicated to the memory of Rev. Edward Gabler, the priest and rector from 1928 to 1944. See also *Congressional Cemetery *National Register of Historic Places listings in Washington, D.C.

This does not include the scavenging of corpses, a single attack born of opportunity or desperate hunger, or the incidental eating of a human that the animal has killed in self-defense. However, all three cases (especially the last two) may habituate an animal to eating human flesh or to attacking humans, and may foster the development of man-eating behavior. Although human beings can be attacked by many kinds of animals, man-eaters are those that have incorporated human flesh into their usual diet and actively hunt and kill humans. Most reported cases of man- eaters have involved lions, tigers, leopards, and crocodilians. However, they are not the only predators that will attack humans if given the chance; a wide variety of species have also been known to adopt humans as usual prey, including bears, Komodo dragons and hyenas. Felids The man-eater of Segur, a young man-eating male Bengal tiger who killed five people in the Nilgiri Hills of Tamil Nadu state in South India. =Tigers= Tigers are recorded to have killed more people than any other big cat, and tigers have been responsible for more human deaths through direct attack than any other wild mammal.Nowak, Ronald M; and Paradiso, John L. Walker's Mammals of the World. 4th ed. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press; 1983. p1088 About 1,000 people were reportedly killed each year in India during the early 1900s, with one individual tiger killing 430 people in India. Tigers killed 129 people in the Sundarbans mangrove forest from 1969 to 1971. Unlike leopards and lions, man-eating tigers rarely enter human habitations in order to acquire prey. The majority of victims are reportedly in the tiger's territory when the attack takes place. Additionally, tiger attacks mostly occur during daylight hours, unlike those committed by leopards and lions. The Sundarbans is home to approximately 600 royal Bengal tigers who before modern times used to \\"regularly kill fifty or sixty people a year\\". In 2008, a loss of habitat due to the Cyclone Sidr led to an increase in the number of attacks on humans in the Indian side of the Sunderbans, as tigers were crossing over to the Indian side from Bangladesh. A theory promoted to explain this suggests that since tigers drink fresh water, the salinity of the area waters serve as a destabilizing factor in the diet and life of tigers of Sundarbans, keeping them in constant discomfort and making them extremely aggressive. Other theories include the sharing of their habitat with human beings and the consumption of human corpses during floods. =Lions= The Tsavo maneaters on display in the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. Man-eating lions have been recorded to actively enter human villages at night as well as during the day to acquire prey. This greater assertiveness usually makes man-eating lions easier to dispatch than tigers. Lions typically become man-eaters for the same reasons as tigers: starvation, old age and illness, though as with tigers, some man-eaters were reportedly in perfect health. The lion's proclivity for man-eating has been systematically examined. American and Tanzanian scientists report that man-eating behavior in rural areas of Tanzania increased greatly from 1990 to 2005. At least 563 villagers were attacked and many eaten over this period‚Äîa number far exceeding the more famed \\"Tsavo\\" incidents of a century earlier. The incidents occurred near Selous National Park in Rufiji District and in Lindi Province near the Mozambican border. While the expansion of villagers into bush country is one concern, the authors argue that conservation policy must mitigate the danger because, in this case, conservation contributes directly to human deaths. Cases in Lindi have been documented where lions seize humans from the centre of substantial villages. It is estimated that over 250 people are killed by lions every year.Top 10 deadliest animals on the planet, The Daily Telegraph, April 14, 2009 Man-eating lions studies indicate that African lions eat humans as a supplement to other food, not as a last resort. In July 2018, a South African news website reported that three rhino poachers were mauled and eaten by lions at Sibuya Game Reserve in Eastern Cape province, South Africa. =Leopards= Man-eating leopards are a small percentage of all leopards, but have undeniably been a menace in some areas;Nowak, Ronald M; and Paradiso, John L. Walker's Mammals of the World. 4th ed. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press; 1983. p1090 one leopard in India killed over 200 people. Jim Corbett was noted to have stated that unlike tigers, which usually became man-eaters because of infirmity, leopards more commonly did so after scavenging on human corpses. In the area that Corbett knew well, dead people are usually cremated completely, but when there is a bad disease epidemic, the death rate outruns the supply of cremation pyre wood and people burn the body a little and throw it over the edge of the burning ghat.Time Magazine Canadian edition, Saving The Big Cats, issue August 23, 2004, p.38, pp.40-41. In Asia, man-eating leopards usually attack at night, and have been reported to break down doors and thatched roofs in order to reach human prey. Attacks in Africa are reported less often, though there have been occasions where attacks occurred in daylight. Both Corbett and Kenneth Anderson have written that hunting the man eating panther presented more challenges than any other animal. In 2019 in India, an infant was stolen and decapitated by a leopard.https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/baby-snatched-cot- decapitated-leopard-14433607 =Jaguars= Jaguar attacks on humans are rare nowadays. In the past, they were more frequent, at least after the arrival of Conquistadors in the Americas. The risk to humans would increase if there were fewer capybaras, which the jaguars mainly preyed on. =Cougars= Due to the expanding human population, cougar ranges increasingly overlap with areas inhabited by humans. Attacks on humans are very rare, as cougar prey recognition is a learned behavior and they do not generally recognize humans as prey.Time Magazine Canadian edition, Saving The Big Cats, issue August 23, 2004, p.43. Attacks on people, livestock, and pets may occur when a puma habituates to humans or is in a condition of severe starvation. Attacks are most frequent during late spring and summer, when juvenile cougars leave their mothers and search for new territory. Unlike other big cat man-eaters, cougars do not kill humans as a result of old age or food preference, but in defense of their territory. Such behavior has been documented in hunts by humans, where the cougar is flushed out by dogs which it either outruns or mauls some distance away. Then, the cougar circles around and mauls the hunter in ambush attack. Primates The only documented man-eaters among the great apes are humans themselves and chimpanzees. As humans encroach further on chimpanzee habitat in Africa, the occurrence of chimpanzees killing human children has allegedly become more common.https://www.foxnews.com/science/chimps-killing- people-in-uganda The cultural practice of cannibalism has been observed in some societies across the world, but was never widespread and is now very rare. Canids =Wolves= Two of the Wolves of P√©rigord, responsible for the deaths of 18 people in February 1766, on display at the chateau of Razac in Thiviers Contrasted to other carnivorous mammals known to attack humans for food, the frequency with which wolves have been recorded to kill people is rather low, indicating that, though potentially dangerous, wolves are among the least threatening for their size and predatory potential, except for the dog which poses lethal hazards for reasons other than predation. In the rare cases in which man-eating wolf attacks occur, the majority of victims are children. Habituation is a known factor contributing to some man-eating wolf attacks which results from living close to human habitations, causing wolves to lose their fear of humans and consequently approach too closely, much like urban coyotes. Habituation can also happen when people intentionally encourage wolves to approach them, usually by offering them food, or unintentionally, when people do not sufficiently intimidate them. This is corroborated by accounts demonstrating that wolves in protected areas are more likely to show boldness toward humans than ones in areas where they are actively hunted. =Dingoes= Attacks on humans by dingoes are rare, with only two recorded fatalities in Australia. Dingoes are normally shy of humans and avoid encounters with them. The most famous record of a dingo attack was the disappearance of nine-week-old Azaria Chamberlain. Her parents reported that they both saw a dingo taking Azaria out of their tent when she and her family were out on a camping trip to Uluru. In 2019 in Australia, a father saved his 14-month old infant from a dingo which had dragged it away.https://www.news.com.au/national/queensland/infant-recovering-in- hospital-after-terrifying-dingo-attack/news- story/517dca54aa0814187d700b746798844a =Domestic dogs= Although dogs have many of the characteristics of bears and Big Cats known to be man-eaters, they are unlikely to act as man-eaters themselves. More often humans can be bitten to death by packs of stray dogs, but not eaten. It often occurs in the countries of Eastern Europe, ex-USSR countries, and some South Asian countries, like India. Predatory acts by dogs upon humans have occurred, however, and many such incidents were the result of human misconduct. During World War II, Nazi prison guards such as Irma Grese and Kurt Franz reportedly set dogs upon live prisoners in Nazi concentration camps with the dogs killing the victims and partially devouring the corpses.Yitzhak Arad (1987). Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka: The Operation Reinhard Death Camps, Bloomington: Indiana University Press, pp. 189-190. =Coyotes= Almost all known predatory coyote attacks on humans have failed. To date, other than the Kelly Keen coyote attack and the Taylor Mitchell coyote attack, all known victims have survived by fighting, fleeing, or being rescued, and only in the latter case was the victim partially eaten, although that case occurred in Nova Scotia where the local animals are eastern coyotes (coywolves). Bears Polar bears, particularly young and undernourished ones will hunt people for food. Although bears rarely attack humans, bear attacks often cause devastating injuries due to the size and immense strength of the giant land and shoreline carnivores. As with dogs, predatory intent is not necessary; territorial disputes and protection of cubs can result in death by bear attack. Truly man-eating bear attacks are uncommon, but are known to occur when the animals are diseased or natural prey is scarce, often leading them to attack and eat anything they are able to kill. In July 2008, dozens of starving brown bears killed two geologists working at a salmon hatchery in Kamchatka. After the partially eaten remains of the two workers were discovered, authorities responded by dispatching hunters to cull or disperse the bears. While American black bears rarely attack people, lone, predatory black bears are responsible for most fatal black bear attacks on humans in the United States and Canada, according to a study from 2011. Unlike female bears, motivated to attack humans to protect cubs, male black bears actually prey on humans, viewing them as a potential food source. Though usually shy and cautious animals, Asian black bears are more aggressive toward humans than the brown bears of Eurasia.Bear Anatomy and Physiology from Gary Brown's The Great Bear Almanac, Lyons & Burford, Publishers, 1993 Brown bears seldom attack humans on sight, and usually avoid people. They are, however, unpredictable in temperament, and will attack if they are surprised or feel threatened.Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance by Stephen Herrero, Hurtig Publishers Ltd./ Edmonton 1985 In some areas of India and Burma, sloth bears are more feared than tigers, due to their unpredictable temperament. Hyenas Although hyenas readily feed upon human corpses, they are generally very wary of humans and less dangerous than the big cats whose territory overlaps with theirs. Nonetheless, both the spotted hyena and the smaller striped hyena are powerful predators quite capable of killing an adult human, and are known to attack people when food is scarce. Like most predators, hyena attacks tend to target women, children, and infirm men, though both species can and do attack healthy adult males on occasion. The spotted hyena is the more dangerous of the two species, being larger, more predatory, and more aggressive than the striped hyena. The brown hyena and aardwolf are not known to prey on humans. Suidae =Pigs= Although not true carnivores, pigs are competent predators and can kill and eat helpless humans unable to escape them. Numerous animal trials in the Middle Ages involved pigs accused of eating children. In 2019, a woman was attacked and killed by a herd of feral hogs in rural Texas. She died due to exsanguination from bite wounds.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/26/us/texas- woman-killed-feral-hogs.html Rodents =Rats= Despite small individual size, rats in large numbers can kill helpless people by eating humans alive.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41198770 Rat torture has been documented by Amnesty International.Chile: Evidence of torture: an Amnesty International Report. London (Amnesty International Publications) 1983, pp. 35‚Äì37 Reptiles The Nile crocodile is one of the species involved in the most unprovoked fatal attacks on humans. =Crocodiles= Crocodile attacks on people are common in places where crocodiles are native. The saltwater and Nile crocodiles are responsible for more attacks and more deaths than any other wild predator that attacks humans for food. Each year, hundreds of deadly attacks are attributed to the Nile crocodile within sub-Saharan Africa. Because many relatively healthy populations of Nile crocodiles occur in East Africa, their proximity to people living in poverty and/or without infrastructure has made it likely that the Nile crocodile is responsible for more attacks on humans than all other species combined. In Australia crocodiles have also been responsible for several deaths in the tropical north of the country. The Mugger crocodile is another man-eater that kills many people in Asia each year, although not to the same level as the saltwater and Nile crocodiles. All crocodile species are also dangerous to humans, but most do not actively prey on them. =Alligators= Despite their manifest ability to kill prey similar to or larger than humans in size and their commonness in an area of dense human settlement (the southeastern United States, especially Florida), American alligators rarely prey upon humans. Even so, there have been several notable instances of alligators opportunistically attacking humans, especially the careless, small children, and elderly. Unlike the far- more dangerous saltwater and Nile crocodiles, the majority of alligators avoid contact with humans if possible, especially if they have been hunted. Incidents have happened, and they may not all have been predatory in nature. =Snakes= Only very few species of snakes are physically capable of swallowing an adult human. Although quite a few claims have been made about giant snakes swallowing adult humans, only a limited number have been confirmed. In 2017 in Indonesia, an adult was discovered inside of a python, and on June 14, 2018 a 54-year-old woman named Wa Tiba was eaten by a reticulated python, which had slithered into her garden at her home. Large constricting snakes will sometimes constrict and kill prey that are too large to swallow. Also, multiple cases are documented of medium-sized ( to ) captive Burmese pythons constricting and killing humans, including several nonintoxicated, healthy adult men, one of whom was a \\"student\\" zookeeper. In the zookeeper case, the python was attempting to swallow the zookeeper's head when other keepers intervened. In addition, at least one Burmese python as small as constricted and killed an intoxicated adult man. A large constricting snake may constrict or swallow an infant or a small child, a threat that is legitimate and empirically proven. Cases of python attacks on children have been recorded for the green anaconda, the African rock python, and the Burmese python. In the Philippines, more than a quarter of Aeta men (a modern forest- dwelling hunter-gatherer group) have reported surviving reticulated python predation attempts. Pythons are nonvenomous, ambush predators, and both the Aeta and pythons hunt deer, wild pigs, and monkeys, making them competitors and prey. In South Africa in 2002, a 10-year-old boy was swallowed whole by a African Rock Python, but cases like these are empirically observed and recorded, but not entirely confirmed unlike the cases mentioned above. =Lizards= Large Komodo dragons are the only known lizard species to occasionally attack and consume humans. Because they live on remote islands, attacks are infrequent and may go unreported. Despite their large size, attacks on people are often unsuccessful and the victims manage to escape with severe wounds. Birds Some evidence supports the contention that the African crowned eagle occasionally views human children as prey, with a witness account of one attack (in which the victim, a seven-year-old boy, survived and the eagle was killed),Steyn, P. 1982. Birds of prey of southern Africa: their identification and life histories. David Phillip, Cape Town, South Africa. and the discovery of part of a human child skull in a nest. This would make it the only living bird known to prey on humans, although other birds such as ostriches and cassowaries have killed humans in self-defense and a lammergeier might have killed Aeschylus by accident.el Hoyo, J.; Elliott, A.; Sargatal, J., eds. (1994). Handbook of the Birds of the World. 2. Barcelona: Lynx Edicions. p. 107. . Various large raptors like golden eagles are reported attacking human beings,Dickinson, Rachel (2009). Falconer on the Edge. Houghton Mifflin-Harcourt. . but its unclear if they intend to eat them or if they have ever been successful in killing one. Some fossil evidence indicates large birds of prey occasionally preyed on prehistoric hominids. The Taung Child, an early human found in Africa, is believed to have been killed by an eagle-like bird similar to the crowned eagle. The extinct Haast's eagle may have preyed on humans in New Zealand, and this conclusion would be consistent with Maori folklore. Leptoptilos robustus might have preyed on both Homo floresiensis and anatomically modern humans, and the Malagasy crowned eagle, teratorns, Woodward's eagle and Caracara major are similar in size to the Haast's eagle, implying that they similarly could pose a threat to a human being. Fish =Sharks= Sign warning swimmers of the danger of shark attacks Contrary to popular belief, only a limited number of shark species are known to pose a serious threat to humans. The species that are most dangerous can be indiscriminate and will take any potential meal they happen to come across (as an oceanic whitetip might eat a person floating in the water after a shipwreck), or may bite out of curiosity or mistaken identity (as with a great white shark attacking a human on a surfboard possibly because it resembles its favoured prey, a seal). Of more than 568 shark species, only four have been involved in a significant number of fatal unprovoked attacks on humans: the great white shark, tiger shark, bull shark,ISAF Statistics on Attacking Species of Shark and the oceanic whitetip shark.

The ship was commissioned in 1892 and served as the flagship of the Channel Fleet for the next five years. She was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1897 and returned home in 1902, and was briefly assigned as a coast guard ship before she began a lengthy refit in 1903‚Äì1904. Royal Sovereign was reduced to reserve in 1905 and was taken out of service in 1909. The ship was sold for scrap four years later and subsequently broken up in Italy. Design and description Right plan and elevation of the Royal Sovereign class from Brassey's Naval Annual 1906 The design of the Royal Sovereign-class ships was derived from that of the battleships, greatly enlarged to improve seakeeping and to provide space for a secondary armament as in the preceding battleships.Gardiner, p. 116; Parkes, pp. 359 The ships displaced at normal load and at deep load. They had a length between perpendiculars of and an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of .Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 32 Their crew consisted of 670 officers and ratings.Burt, p. 73 The Royal Sovereigns were powered by a pair of three-cylinder, vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft. Her Humphrys & Tennant engines were designed to produce a total of and a maximum speed of using steam provided by eight cylindrical boilers with forced draught. Royal Sovereign was the first ship of the class to be completed, and was put through a lengthy set of steam trials of which only a few sets of figures have survived. She made over eight hours from using normal draught and over three hours from using forced draught. Some of her boiler tubes were observed to crack and leak under the pressures involved; as a result, the Navy decided not to push the boilers of the Royal Sovereign class past 11,000 ihp to prevent similar damage. The ships carried a maximum of of coal, which gave them a range of at a speed of .Burt, pp. 73, 83‚Äì84 Their main armament consisted of four breech-loading (BL) guns mounted in two twin-gun barbettes, one each fore and aft of the superstructure.Parkes, p. 355 Each gun was provided with 80 rounds. Their secondary armament consisted of ten quick-firing (QF) guns. 200 rounds per gun were carried by the ships. Sixteen QF 6-pounder () guns of an unknown type and a dozen QF 3-pounder () Hotchkiss guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats. The two 3-pounders in the upper fighting top were removed in 1903‚Äì1904 and all of the remaining light guns from the lower fighting tops and main deck followed in 1905‚Äì1909. The Royal Sovereign-class ships mounted seven 14-inch (356 mm) torpedo tubes, although Royal Sovereign had four of hers removed in 1903‚Äì04.Burt, pp. 73, 85, 87 The Royal Sovereigns' armour scheme was similar to that of the Trafalgars, as the waterline belt of compound armour only protected the area between the barbettes. The belt and transverse bulkheads thick closed off the ends of the belt. Above the belt was a strake of Harvey armour closed off by oblique bulkheads. The barbettes were protected by compound armour, ranging in thickness from and the casemates for the 6-inch guns were protected by an equal thickness of armour. The thicknesses of the armour deck ranged from . The walls of the forward conning tower were thick and the aft conning tower was protected by 3-inch plates.Burt, pp. 79‚Äì80 Construction and career left The Royal Sovereign class was ordered as part of the Naval Defence Act 1889 that was a supplement to the normal naval estimates.Burt, p. 90 Royal Sovereign, the seventh ship of her name to serve with the Royal Navy,Colledge, p. 301 was laid down on 30 September 1889 in a drydock because Portsmouth Dockyard lacked a slipway long enough to accommodate her.Parkes, pp. 355‚Äì56 The ship was floated out of dock on 26 February 1891 and christened by Queen Victoria. She completed her sea trials in May 1892 and was commissioned on 31 May at a cost of ¬£913,986. Royal Sovereign relieved the battleship as flagship of the Channel Squadron. From then until 13 August 1892, she served as the flagship of the \\"Red Fleet\\" in the annual manoeuvres off the coast of Ireland. She reprised her role as the flagship of the Red Fleet, from 27 July to 6 August 1893 during the manoeuvres in the Irish Sea and the Western Approaches. To reduce her rolling, she was fitted with bilge keels in 1894‚Äì95.Burt, pp. 75, 90 In June 1895, Royal Sovereign and three of her sister ships were part of a British naval squadron that attended the opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal in Germany.Parkes, p. 363 During the third week of July 1896, the ship took part in annual manoeuvres in the Irish Sea and off the southwest coast of England as part of \\"Fleet A\\". On 7 June 1897, Royal Sovereign paid off and her crew was transferred to the battleship which relieved her in the Channel Squadron. The next day, she recommissioned to relieve the battleship in the Mediterranean Sea. Before departing for the Mediterranean, she took part in the Fleet Review for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria at Spithead on 26 June 1897, and from 7‚Äì11 July took part in annual manoeuvres off the coast of Ireland. She finally departed England for the Mediterranean in September. Upon arrival, Royal Sovereign joined the Mediterranean Fleet. On 18 January 1899, Rear- Admiral Gerard Noel, Second-in-Command of the Mediterranean Fleet, hoisted his flag aboard the shipAkers, p. 30 and Captain Charles Henry Adair was appointed in command two days later. The following month the ship toured Italian waters, visiting Naples, Genoa, Palermo and Syracuse. On 14 July, she visited Fiume (modern Rijeka), Croatia, in company with four other battleships, departing five days later. On the 28th, one man was killed aboard Royal Sovereign in a gun accident and he was buried at sea that evening.Akers, pp. 50, 52, 54 A 1913 postcard showing Royal Sovereign at sea On 9 November 1901, off Greece, one of her six-inch guns exploded when the breech was not fully closed, killing one officer (Captain Humphry Weston Spurway of Oakford, Devon) and five Royal Marines and injuring one officer (Sir Robert Keith Arbuthnot, 4th Bt) and 19 seamen. Captain Frederick Inglefield was appointed in command on 26 November 1901. After being relieved in the Mediterranean by the battleship , Royal Sovereign departed Gibraltar on 9 July 1902, arriving at Portsmouth, England, on 14 July 1902. She served as flagship to Sir Charles Frederick Hotham, Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth, during the fleet review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII. Paid-off at Portsmouth on 29 August, she immediately re-commissioned under Captain George Primrose and the crew of , to take that ship‚Ä≤s place as a coast guard ship at Portsmouth. She later joined the home squadron. From 5‚Äì9 August 1903, the ship participated in manoeuvres off the coast of Portugal. From 1903 to 1904, she underwent an extensive refit at Portsmouth during which six-inch armoured casemates were added for the six-inch guns. On 9 February 1907, Royal Sovereign commissioned as a special service vessel in reserve. As such, she was incorporated into the 4th Division of the Home Fleet with other such vessels in April 1909. In September 1909, Royal Sovereign was taken out of service and she was sold for scrap to G. Clarkson & Son for ¬£40,000 on 7 October 1913.

The place, which consists mainly of two deserted buildings which lost their former purpose as an inn and customs house, is notable for having marked for about five centuries the northernmost point of Prussia (i.e. the Province of East Prussia) and the northeastern tip of the German Empire from 1871. Its German name literally means \\"glutton\\", although etymologically it is a corruption of the Old Curonian toponym Nimersata denoting marshy land (nemir≈°ele). History East Prussian Memel district 1818-1920, with Nimmersatt at its northernmost tip During the Prussian Crusade from about 1200 onwards, the area of the local Baltic Skalvian and Curonian pagans was conquered by German military orders, at first by the Sword Brethren, after the 1236 Battle of Saule by the Teutonic Knights. When in the early 15th century the State of the Teutonic Order interfered with the neighbouring Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland, culminating in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian‚ÄìTeutonic War, the 1422 Treaty of Melno finally fixed the borders of the Monastic State with the Lithuanian Samogitia region. In the course of the Protestant Reformation, the Teutonic State in 1525 dissolved and the Nemirseta area became the northernmost outpost of secularized Duchy of Prussia, from 1618 of united Brandenburg-Prussia under the Lutheran House of Hohenzollern. By the 1660 Treaty of Oliva the \\"Great Elector\\" Frederick William of Brandenburg was able to shift off Polish suzerainty. When the Hohenzollern Kingdom of Prussia merged into the German Empire in 1871, Nimmersatt became its northeasternmost settlement, schoolchildren were taught the rhyme Nimmersatt, wo das Reich sein Ende hat, which means \\"Nimmersatt, where the Empire ends\\" [1]. The village included a customs house and an inn (Kurhaus) providing shelter for travellers from and to Imperial Russia's Lithuanian provinces. A part of the Province of East Prussia until after World War I, in 1920 Nemirseta was with the Klaipƒóda Region (Memelland) separated from Germany according to the Treaty of Versailles. It was put under administration of the League of Nations and controlled by French forces, until the 1923 Klaipƒóda Revolt, after which it was annexed by Lithuania. For a brief period Nemirseta again became a border checkpoint, when Lithuanian Foreign Minister Juozas Urb≈°ys under pressure of Nazi Germany in March 1939 signed an agreement after which the Klaipƒóda Region was reannexed to the German nation. The secret protocol of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact allocated it to the German sphere of influence. After World War II, according to the 1945 Potsdam Agreement, the region again became part of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic and the remaining German population was expelled. Part of a large Soviet Army proving ground, the place now called Nemirseta finally lost its meaning as a German border town and most of the buildings were demolished. The area was incorporated into the Palanga municipality in 1975.

A list of Dumnonian kings is one of the hardest of the major Dark Age kingdoms to accurately compile, as it is confused by Arthurian legend, complicated by strong associations with the kings of Wales and Brittany, and obscured by the Saxon advance. Therefore, this list should be treated with caution. Dumnonian kings The original Celtic chiefs of the Dumnonii ruled in the south-west until faced with the Roman arrival into their territory in c.AD 55 when the Romans established a legionary fortress at Isca Dumnoniorum (modern Exeter). Although subjugated by c.AD 78, the civitas Dumnoniorum was one of the regions of Roman Britain least affected by Roman influence.Todd (1987), p.216. Known as Caer Uisc, Exeter was inhabited by Dumnonian Britons up until c.936 when King Athelstan expelled them.Snyder (2003), p.169.

Its first rector was Reuel Keith (1792‚Äì1842), who with William Holland Wilmer rector of St. Paul's Church in 1818 founded an Education Society to train Episcopal priests. Rev. Keith left this parish in 1820 to accept a position at Bruton Parish Church and teach at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, although he later returned to the new national capital and taught at the Virginia Theological Seminary when it was founded in 1823. The current church building, built in 1885‚Äì1886, replaced an earlier church building built in 1818. The church building was erected at a cost of $50,000 (), and it opened on October 28, 1886.\\"West Washington\\". The Critic (Washington, D.C.). October 4, 1886. p. 3.\\"West Washington\\".

It has been termed a \\"miniature cathedral\\" for its \\"tall dominating bell tower, its stone Gothic arches and lancet windows.

It starred actress Jennifer Edwards, stepdaughter of Julie Andrews and daughter of Blake Edwards, in the title role, alongside Maximilian Schell, Jean Simmons, and Michael Redgrave. The score was composed by John Williams. The film was sponsored by Timex. Storyline The film altered the plot of the novel considerably, primarily by redefining the relationships of characters to one another. Heidi, instead of being the orphan of Grandfather's late son, becomes the orphan of the Grandfather's late daughter and her late husband; Dete becomes Heidi's aunt as the living but estranged daughter of the Grandfather. In addition, Heidi is further recast as Herr Sesemann's niece because of his late brother's marriage to Grandfather's late daughter. As Sesemann's niece, Heidi becomes cousin rather than simply companion to Clara, who early in the film is negatively portrayed as a hateful and spoiled child. By casting Simmons as Fr√§ulein Rottenmeier, governess for both Heidi and Clara, the film remakes Rottenmeier as an extremely sympathetic character; she becomes almost a surrogate mother to Heidi. This drastic character transformation removes the antagonism between the two, thus removing the tension which dominates and enlivens the novel. So changed is Rottenmeier's personality that she falls in love with Sesemann, and he with her, a situation impossible in the novel. The film also added a subplot in which Heidi's grandfather, a church organist in this version, has long been unable to play because of a family tragedy, which is shown to be his daughter's marriage to Sesemann's brother and her subsequent death. At the very end of the film, he regains his confidence, mounts the steps to the organ, and begins to play. Another difference between the book and the film occurs during Clara's attempts at walking after Sesemann has accepted the Grandfather's invitation for Clara to visit Heidi in his home. In the novel, Sesemann's kindly and strong-willed mother teaches Heidi to read and to pray; she visits the girls on the Alp. Her character is cut completely from the film. In the novel, Peter becomes jealous of Heidi's attentions to Clara and deliberately destroys Clara's wheelchair so that the crippled girl will have to return home; the chain of events resulting from that destruction ends in Clara's taking her first successful steps on the Alp while leaning on Peter and Heidi. In the film, Fr√§ulein Rottenmeier and Herr Sesemann visit the girls, and Grandfather deliberately leaves Clara alone on the mountains, knowing that she actually can walk but has been afraid to try. Clara struggles to get out of her wheelchair, knocking it over and falling down in the process. As she tries to get up, she sees her father, Herr Sesemann, looking at her encouragingly, and haltingly walks towards him. The film ends with a significant glance between Fraulein Rottenmeier and Herr Sesemann, a glance which promises a future for them together. \\"The Heidi Game\\" NBC's decision to cut away from the Jets-Raiders game to air Heidi at 7 p.m. sharp (on the east coast) is noted as one of the most controversial occurrences in television and sports history. The film's premiere on NBC was preceded by an American Football League game between the Oakland Raiders and the New York Jets; although NBC was contractually obligated to begin the broadcast of the film at 7:00 p.m. ET on the East Coast, network management allowed the game's broadcast to continue to its completion, and delaying the broadcast of Heidi until after the game concluded. However, they were unable to communicate this change to a network control facility in New York, as numerous viewers had called the network to inquire over whether NBC would be broadcasting Heidi, or the end of the game. The enormous number of calls blew out all 26 of the NBC phone line switchboard fuses. As scheduled, Heidi began at 7:00 p.m., ending the broadcast of the game on the East Coast. Shortly afterward, Oakland scored two touchdowns within the final minute of the game, winning 43-32 in a major upset that a large portion of the country was unable to witness. Current airings In recent years, the film has been periodically shown on Trinity Broadcasting Network's digital children's channel Smile of a Child.

It is situated on the grounds that formerly housed the Poitevin farm brewery, which was active and served the local area until 1945. The current brewery was founded in 1996 by Daniel Thiriez, who had become interested in homebrewing as a college student, and later left his career as a \\"human resources professional for a large supermarket chain\\" in the interest of reviving the tradition of the small village brewery. It exports beers in Europe, and the USA.La Voix du Nord du 31.11.2014 The brewery's focus is generally on light to medium-colored top-fermented beers with a pronounced hop presence, reflective both of some of the historic beers of the region and the owner's personal preference. There is a tasting room and tap on the brewery premises, at which bottled beer can also be purchased. The products are available in 33cl and 75cl glass bottles, large 2L growlers and on tap. Technical Information The Thiriez Brewery began with a small Velo brand brewhouse manufactured in Italy with a capacity of 6 hL per batch, which was installed within the historic farm structure. However, it quickly outgrew this set-up and is now housed in a purpose-built freestanding building on the grounds, in which a larger system with a 20 hL capacity has been installed. To reach the current annual volume, a batch of beer is started approximately 3 times per week during the brewing season. A two-step infusion mash is typically performed, after which the beers are fermented in one of four cylindro-conical tanks at warm temperatures for up to 7 days, then cold-conditioned for a period of 2‚Äì3 weeks, after which they are dosed with sugar and stored in a warm room to naturally carbonate in the bottle or keg. The beers are unfiltered and continue to condition and mature after packaging, although the brewer advises drinking them within one year. English and Czech hop varieties are primarily used, and some of the recipes utilize spices as well. The distinctive house yeast strain is maintained by a lab in Brussels, and new yeast is typically obtained from them after about 15 uses. In 2007, Wyeast Laboratories commercially released a \\"French Saison\\" strain on a limited basis which is widely believed to have been derived from the Thiriez variety. The strain is now available year-round.

Function  This gene encodes the alpha chain of type VII collagen. The type VII collagen fibril, composed of three identical alpha collagen chains, is restricted to the basement zone beneath stratified squamous epithelia. It functions as an anchoring fibril between the external epithelia and the underlying stroma. Mutations in this gene are associated with all forms of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. In the absence of mutations, however, an autoimmune response against type VII collagen can result in an acquired form of this disease called epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. Type VII collagen is also found in the retina; its function in this organ is unknown. COL7A1 is located on the short arm of human chromosome 3, in the chromosomal region denoted 3p21.31. The gene is approximately 31,000 base pairs in size and is remarkable for the extreme fragmentation of its coding sequence into 118 exons. COL7A1 is transcribed into an mRNA of 9,287 base pairs. In the skin, the type VII collagen protein is synthesized by keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts. The symbol for the orthologous gene in the mouse is Col7a1.  Clinical significance  The inherited disease, dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, is caused by recessive or dominant mutations in COL7A1. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita involves an autoimmune reaction to this form of collagen.  Interactions  Collagen, type VII, alpha 1 has been shown to interact with Laminin 5 and Fibronectin.

He was portrayed by veteran actor Claude Rains. He is a diplomat and political leader, the head of the Arab Bureau, who first enlists T. E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) for work as a liaison to the Arab Revolt, and manipulates Lawrence and the Arabs to ensure Allied dominion over the post-war Middle East. Synopsis Dryden appears early in the film, discussing the military situation in the Middle East with General Archibald Murray (Donald Wolfit) in his Cairo office. He recognizes Lawrence's abilities and knowledge and manages to convince Murray that Lawrence is the \\"man for the job\\". He speaks briefly with Lawrence in his office (which is ornamented with Egyptian artifacts) and tries to convince Lawrence that the desert is a \\"burning, fiery furnace\\" despite Lawrence's claims of it being \\"fun\\". Dryden sums up his attitude by telling Lawrence: > It is recognized you have a funny sense of fun. Dryden reappears at the end of Act I in the office with General Allenby (Jack Hawkins) and Colonel Harry Brighton (Anthony Quayle), as Lawrence recounts the Aqaba expedition, is promoted, and tries to convince Allenby he should be reassigned. Dryden says to Allenby of Lawrence's exploits: > Before he did it, sir, I'd have said it couldn't be done. Dryden sits in on Allenby's and Lawrence's military conference in the courtyard and tells Allenby that the question of British expansion in the Middle East is a \\"difficult question\\". At the end of the scene, he and Brighton debate Allenby's promise to provide Lawrence's Arabs with artillery: > Dryden: Are you really going to give them artillery, sir? Brighton: I was > wondering that, sir. Might be deuce difficult to get it back again. Dryden: > Give them artillery and you've made them independent. Allenby: Then I can't > give them artillery, can I? Dryden: For you to say, sir. Allenby: No, it's > not. I've got orders to obey, thank God! Not like that poor devil - he's > riding the whirlwind. Dryden: Let's hope we're not. Dryden reappears in Allenby's office in Jerusalem where he is meeting with Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness). He informs Lawrence of the Sykes-Picot Agreement, the Anglo-French plan to divide up the Ottoman Empire, and coldly justifies his actions: > A man who tells lies, like me, merely hides the truth. But a man who tells > half-lies, has forgotten where he's put it. As the argument between Lawrence and Allenby escalates, Dryden notices a growing spot of blood on the back of Lawrence's uniform. Dryden draws Allenby's attention to it, and excuses himself. He is accosted by journalist Jackson Bentley (Arthur Kennedy), who demands to see Lawrence. Dryden dismisses him, describing the argument between Lawrence and Allenby: > It's a little clash of temperament that's going on in there. Inevitably, one > of them's half-mad. And the other‚Äîwholly unscrupulous. Dryden reappears in Damascus, convincing General Allenby to stand by and allow Lawrence and Feisal's \\"Arab Council\\" to collapse on its own, fearing that any interference with them would cause \\"a full-scale rising\\". At the end of the film, Dryden helps Allenby and Feisal hammer out a compromise as the Arab Council collapses, trying to save Arab face while handing power over to the British. Asked his opinion of the situation by Feisal, Dryden responds with his typical world-weariness: > Me, Your Highness? Well, on the whole, I wish I'd stayed in Tunbridge Wells. Basis Like Sherif Ali and Colonel Brighton, Dryden was an amalgamation of several historical figures. Robert Bolt stated that the character was created to \\"represent the civilian and political wing of British interests, to balance Allenby's military objectives.\\"Lawrence of Arabia or Smith in the Desert? The most often cited predecessor for Dryden is Sir Ronald Storrs. Storrs was an intelligence officer with whom Lawrence first travelled to the Hejaz to meet with the Arab forces, and somewhat reluctantly assigned Lawrence as a liaison. Storrs headed the Arab Bureau and also became Governor of Jerusalem after its capture by Allenby. Other sources for Dryden include D. G. Hogarth, an archaeologist friend of Lawrence who also served as an intelligence officer; Henry McMahon, the High Commissioner of Egypt who negotiated the McMahon- Hussein Correspondence which effectively trigged the Arab Revolt; and Mark Sykes, who helped draw up the Sykes-Picot Agreement which co-divided the post- war Middle East. Lawrence's official biographer, Jeremy Wilson, characterizes Sykes as \\"ambitious and... capable of wholly cynical manoeuvring when this would achieve some short-term goal\\",Wilson, Lawrence of Arabia: The Authorized Biography of T.E. Lawrence (1990), p. 230 similar to the film's fictional Dryden. Dryden is, as shown by the dialogue quoted above, an exceedingly cynical and unscrupulous individual who uses short-sighted pragmatism as his primary weapon. In an early scene with General Murray, he tells him that \\"The job of the moment is to win the war\\", showing that his concern is with the immediate rather than long-term consequences. He is aware of the consequences of his actions but does not seem concerned with them. He is also very intelligent, perceptive, and cultured (shown by his knowledge of the Middle East and his collection of archaeological findings in his office), referred to by Bolt as a \\"cultivated xenophile\\" in the script, and uses this knowledge to manipulate both Lawrence and the Arabs. Dryden is a typical 'Political Agent'. At this period the political agents were seconded from the ICS (Indian Civil Service). They had a stated rank, and their rank counted as \\"higher than the highest ranking officer in the room.\\" This means they out-ranked any army officer in any circumstances.

These uncertainties are risks to the project. Some refer to these risks as \\"known-unknowns\\" because the estimator is aware of them, and based on past experience, can even estimate their probable costs. The estimated costs of the known-unknowns is referred to by cost estimators as cost contingency. Contingency \\"refers to costs that will probably occur based on past experience, but with some uncertainty regarding the amount. The term is not used as a catchall to cover ignorance. It is poor engineering and poor philosophy to make second-rate estimates and then try to satisfy them by using a large contingency account. The contingency allowance is designed to cover items of cost which are not known exactly at the time of the estimate but which will occur on a statistical basis.\\"Frederic C. Jelen, James H. Black, Cost and Optimization Engineering, Third Edition, McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1983, pg 456-457 The cost contingency which is included in a cost estimate, bid, or budget may be classified as to its general purpose, that is what it is intended to provide for. For a class 1 construction cost estimate, usually needed for a bid estimate, the contingency may be classified as an estimating and contracting contingency. This is intended to provide compensation for \\"estimating accuracy based on quantities assumed or measured, unanticipated market conditions, scheduling delays and acceleration issues, lack of bidding competition, subcontractor defaults, and interfacing omissions between various work categories.\\"Standard Estimating Practice Sixth Edition, American Society of Professional Estimators, Bni Publications, Inc, 2004, , Pg 103 Additional classifications of contingency may be included at various stages of a project's life, including design contingency, or design definition contingency, or design growth contingency, and change order contingency (although these may be more properly called allowances). AACE International has defined contingency as \\"An amount added to an estimate to allow for items, conditions, or events for which the state, occurrence, or effect is uncertain and that experience shows will likely result, in aggregate, in additional costs. Typically estimated using statistical analysis or judgment based on past asset or project experience. Contingency usually excludes: # Major scope changes such as changes in end product specification, capacities, building sizes, and location of the asset or project # Extraordinary events such as major strikes and natural disasters # Management reserves # Escalation and currency effects Some of the items, conditions, or events for which the state, occurrence, and/or effect is uncertain include, but are not limited to, planning and estimating errors and omissions, minor price fluctuations (other than general escalation), design developments and changes within the scope, and variations in market and environmental conditions. Contingency is generally included in most estimates, and is expected to be expended\\".\\"Cost Engineering Terminology\\", Recommended Practice 10S-90, AACE International, WV, rev. 2007 A key phrase above is that it is \\"expected to be expended\\". In other words, it is an item in an estimate like any other, and should be estimated and included in every estimate and every budget. Because management often thinks contingency money is \\"fat\\" that is not needed if a project team does its job well, it is a controversial topic. In general, there are four classes of methods used to estimate contingency. .\\"Hollmann, John K., \\"The Monte-Carlo Challenge: A Better Approach\\", 2007 AACE International Transactions, AACE International, Morgantown, WV, 2007. These include the following: # Expert judgment # Predetermined guidelines (with varying degrees of judgment and empiricism used) # Simulation analysis (primarily risk analysis judgment incorporated in a simulation such as Monte-Carlo) # Parametric Modeling (empirically-based algorithm, usually derived through regression analysis, with varying degrees of judgment used). While all are valid methods, the method chosen should be consistent with the first principles of risk management in that the method must start with risk identification, and only then are the probable cost of those risks quantified. In best practice, the quantification will be probabilistic in nature (Monte-Carlo is a common method used for quantification). Typically, the method results in a distribution of possible cost outcomes for the project, product, or other investment. From this distribution, a cost value can be selected that has the desired probability of having a cost underrun or cost overrun. Usually a value is selected with equal chance of over or underrunning. The difference between the cost estimate without contingency, and the selected cost from the distribution is contingency. For more information, AACE International has catalogued many professional papers on this complex topic.Uppal, Kul (editor), Professional Practice Guide (PPG)#8, \\"Contingency\\", 2nd Edition, AACE International, Morgantown WV, 2007. Contingency is included in budgets as a control account. As risks occur on a project, and money is needed to pay for them, the contingency can be transferred to the appropriate accounts that need it. The transfer and its reason is recorded. In risk management, risks are continually reassessed during the course of a project, as are the needs for cost contingency.

The anti-tank ditch was located 12 kilometres south of Newcastle, south of the town of Belmont. At the time it was anticipated that the Imperial Japanese Army may attempt a beach landing between Belmont and Swansea Channel along Nine Mile Beach. Barbed wire fencing and machine gun emplacements were constructed along the entire length of Nine Mile Beach. The anti tank ditch was constructed where the sand spit peninsular is only about one kilometre in width and is partially taken up by Belmont Lagoon which is a large marshy lagoon which is connected to Lake Macquarie by Cold Tea Creek. Cold Tea Creek was dredged and straightened and the creek formed the anti tank ditch, which was designed to prevent enemy tanks proceeding north to Newcastle. Anti-tank defences included two interlocking rows of concrete tetrahedrons tank traps or Dragons Teeth were located on the southern bank of the ditch to obstruct the movement of tanks. Twenty seven acres of dense scrubland to the immediate south of the ditch was cleared to deny cover to enemy forces and pile driven vertical timber posts or Dumble Tank Stops were located every five feet along the northern bank of the ditch to form a vertical barrier to any tanks that gained access to the ditch. The concrete tetrahedrons and vertical timber posts extended in straight lines from within Lake Macquarie to the sea. Belmont Anti-Tank Ditch Dumble Tank Stops A temporary bridge over the anti tank ditch was built of timber. In the event of attack it could be collapsed quickly into the ditch by the withdrawal of five bolts. Many of the pile driven vertical timber posts or Dumble Tank Stops are still visible; however are slowly succumbing to the elements. Two concrete tetrahedrons have been relocated to the Ken Lambkin Reserve to form a memorial, and sit on the southern bank of the creek mouth. The 8th Garrison and 32 Brigade of the Australian Army were responsible for the defence from Adamstown, Dudley, Redhead to Blacksmiths of the southern perimeter defensive system of the Port of Newcastle.

During his political career, he became known as the \\"Bald Eagle of Westchester\\". Biography He was educated at Bedford Academy, and graduated from Yale College in 1854. Then he studied law with Edward Wells at Peekskill, New York and was admitted to the bar in 1857. He had become a member of the Know Nothing party, and in 1855, he was chosen Town Superintendent of Public Schools in Peekskill. In 1858, he was elected School Commissioner of Westchester County on the Know Nothing ticket. After the majority of the Know Nothings amalgamated with the Democratic Party in 1859, Husted published a vigorous protest against this \\"betrayal of the principles upon which the Know Nothing Party was founded\\", and joined the Republican Party. Before running for office, Husted served in several political appointee positions, being appointed a Deputy Superintendent of the State Insurance Department in 1860, a Harbormaster of New York in 1862, and later a Deputy Collector of the port. Marriage and family Husted married and had the following children: Thomas D. Husted, James William Husted, Jr., Helen S. Husted and Hattie Husted. The younger James became a politician like his father, eventually elected to four successive terms as a US Congressman from New York. Political career He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Westchester Co., 3rd D.) in 1869, 1870, 1871, 1872, 1873, 1874, 1875, 1876, 1877 and 1878. He was a member of the State Assembly (Rockland Co.) in 1879 and 1880. He was again a member of the State Assembly (Westchester Co., 3rd D.) in 1881, 1884, 1885, 1886, 1887, 1888, 1889, 1890, 1891 and 1892. He was elected six times Speaker: in 1874, 1876, 1878, 1886, 1887 and 1890, a record at the time. He was Minority Leader in 1892. In March 1873, Governor John Adams Dix appointed him Major-General of the Fifth Division of the National Guard. Prior to this appointment, Husted had been Judge Advocate on the staff of the Seventh Brigade of the State Militia. He commanded the division for several years, and after that, was commonly referred to as General Husted. In 1874, as Junior Grand Warden, Husted performed the Masonic burial rite at the interment of New York City Police Commissioner Henry Smith in Amsterdam, New York, after Methodist services had taken place. It was a major public funeral, with numerous Masons and members of the New York State legislature.\\"Burial of Henry Smith\\", New York Times, 28 Feb 1874, accessed 25 Aug 2010 In 1876, he became Grand Master of the Masonic Grand Lodge of New York.Proceedings of the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of the State of New York, May 1921, p. 256.

She was used by the Union Navy as a gunboat in support of the Union Navy blockade of Confederate waterways. Because of her large size, she was also used, at times, as a cargo ship.  Avenger, a ram built at New Albany, Indiana  On 7 December 1863, the U.S. War Department transferred to the Navy two wooden-hulled, side-wheel rams then being built at New Albany, Indiana, for the Army's Mississippi Marine Brigade. On that day, as he was reporting having taken possession of these still- unfinished vessels, Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter‚Äîwho then commanded the Mississippi Squadron‚Äîsuggested that they be named Avenger and Vindicator.  Assigned to the Mississippi River Squadron  On 19 December, the larger ship, Avenger, was assigned to the squadron's Third District which was responsible for controlling the Mississippi River between Natchez, Mississippi and the mouth of the Red River. Completed late in February 1864, this ram dropped down the Ohio River and was commissioned at Cairo, Illinois, on the 29th of that month, Acting Volunteer Lt. Charles A. Wright in command. = Participating in the Red River Campaign = On 12 March, Avenger‚Äîcarrying dispatches and a cargo of ordnance stores‚Äîheaded downstream to join a powerful naval force which Porter had recently led up the Red River to cooperate with Union Army troops then pushing through Louisiana in a generally northwesterly direction toward Shreveport, Louisiana. The major objectives of the Red River campaign were: the establishment of a Union foothold in Texas to weaken Confederate strength west of the Mississippi River, the impeding of French interventionism in Mexico, and the acquisition of cotton for idle textile mills in the North. = Damaged in a Mississippi River collision = However, when Avenger reached a point only some six miles below Cairo, Illinois, she encountered an upward- bound merchant steamer whose pilot attempted to pass her on the wrong side of the stream. The two vessels collided, and Avenger suffered considerable damage to her starboard side. Although she was able to continue on down the Mississippi River, the ram lost nearly a day at Memphis, Tennessee, undergoing repairs. Her trip downriver also revealed defects in her machinery which slowed her progress, but she finally reached the mouth of the Red River on the 16th. There, orders from Porter awaited which directed her to return North with messages. After coaling, she got underway on the 17th and arrived back at Cairo on the 23d. There, Wright's report of her engineering difficulties resulted in a survey of the ship. The inspectors recommended that a set of blowers be installed to increase the efficiency of her boilers. While this work was being performed by the repair ship Samson, it was discovered that the ship's port boilers were badly burned and required repairs. = Successful Ouachita River expedition = After temporary remedies were made, Avenger entered the Red River on 2 April carrying messages upstream. Two days later, she took station at the mouth of the Black River and, on the 7th, she entered the Ouachita River in an expedition commanded by Lt. Comdr. James P. Foster in the side-wheel ram Lafayette. The Union warships ascended that tributary as high as Ouachita City and confiscated some 3,000 bales of cotton; liberated 800 negroes; and burned the courthouse at Monroe, Louisiana, the railroad depot there, and a bridge over the stream. = Bedford attacks Fort Pillow = They stood down the Ouachita River on the 12th and returned to the Mississippi River when they learned that the famous Confederate cavalry commander, Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest, had attacked Fort Pillow, Tennessee. Foster, accompanied by Avenger and Choctaw, ascended the Mississippi River to check Forrest. However, at Memphis he learned that, after pillaging Fort Pillow, the dreaded Southern raider had abandoned the fallen Union stronghold and retired inland. Therefore, Avenger‚Äîwhich had been suffering engine trouble‚Äîwas free to remain at Memphis for repairs which lasted through the end of April. = Hauling coast near the mouth of the Red River = The ram then returned to the mouth of the Red River where she was assigned to guard the coaling barge stationed there. She was relieved by Nymph on 3 May and proceeded to the mouth of the Black River with additional coal barges in tow. There she was again relieved and steamed upriver to join Forest Rose on patrol in the vicinity of Fort deRussy. At that fort, Avenger exchanged shots with Southern sharpshooters on 12 May; and she and her consort engaged the enemy several times as they continued patrols up and down the river during the next five days. = General Nathaniel P. Banks carried to New Orleans = The ram returned to the mouth of the Red River on 17 May to coal and then continued downriver to Simmesport, Louisiana, to embark Major General Nathaniel P. Banks, the commander of the Army forces involved in the Red River expedition, for passage to New Orleans, Louisiana. The advance of his troops had been checked at the Battle of Pleasant Hill and a shortage of ammunition, supplies, and water had forced him to withdraw. = Reassigned to blockade duty = In May, Avenger was stationed at Morganza, Louisiana, and carried out blockading duties between Morganza and Donaldsonville, Louisiana through November, when she was ordered to help in patrolling the Mississippi River between Vicksburg and Natchez, Mississippi. = Mississippi River operations = On 21 November 1864, after spotting a skiff crossing the river at Bruinsburg, Mississippi, Avenger shelled the area and sent a landing party ashore which found contraband concealed in the undergrowth. The landing party captured several Confederate soldiers and confiscated 154 rifles with bayonets, and several skiffs and wagons. She continued to operate in the Mississippi River and, in March 1865, was stationed off Cole's Creek to prevent Confederate troops and supplies from crossing the river. The patrols were intensified in late April and early May in the effort to capture Jefferson Davis, who was believed to be attempting to escape across the Mississippi river. After the President of the defeated Confederacy was captured in Georgia on 10 May, the naval forces employed in blockade duties were gradually reduced.  Post-war decommissioning, sale, and subsequent commercial career  In July 1865, Avenger was sent to Mound City, Illinois, where she was decommissioned on 1 August. Sold at public auction there on 29 November 1865 to Cutting & Ellis, the former ram was documented as Balize on 16 April 1867 and began service out of New Orleans as a merchantman. The steamer continued commercial operations until 1871.

At 21% red grape varieties and 79% white varieties, it is planted with primarily Riesling (41% as of 2018), Pinot gris (11%) and Sp√§tburgunder (Pinot Noir, 11%).German Wine Institute, German Wine Statistics 2019‚Äì2020 (PDF-file; 700 kB) Hessische Bergstra√üe is divided into two districts (Bereiche) - Umstadt and Starkenburg - three collective vineyard sites and 24 individual vineyard sites.German Wine Institute: Hessische Bergstra√üe , accessed on December 29, 2019 The region produces mostly dry wines but does have a sizable production of Eiswein. The wines from the best producers are in a style similar to that of Rheingau.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 345 Oxford University Press 2006 The majority of the region's wine is produced by a winemaking cooperative based in the city of Heppenheim, to which about 620 of 850 growers of the region deliver their grapes. The state government of Hesse, through the Hessian State Wineries (Hessische Staatsweing√ºter) is the biggest single vineyard owner with since 2008 processed in the central cellar of the state wineries at the Steinberg, Kloster Eberbach, site.Der Steinbergkeller , accessed on December 29, 20109 Because of the small production and a location rather close to densely populated areas, most of the wines is sold locally, and it is very uncommon to see Bergstra√üe wines outside of Germany.

Mass graves in Vinnytsia were discovered during Nazi Germany's occupation of Ukraine in 1943.Valery Vasiliev, Yuriy Shapoval, \\"Stages of ¬´Great Terror¬ª: The Vinnytsia Tragedy\\", Zerkalo Nedeli, ‚Ññ 31 (406), August 17‚Äì23, 2002, (in Russian , in Ukrainian ) The investigation of the site first conducted by the international Katyn Commission coincided with the discovery of a similar mass murder site of Polish prisoners of war in Katyn. Nazi Germany utilized this evidence of Communist terror to discredit the Soviet Union internationally, it became one of the more renowned sites of the politically motivated NKVD massacres among many in Ukraine.  History  = Massacre = Most of the victims buried at Vinnytsia were killed using a .22 calibre bullet fired into the back of the neck.; fragment in question originally published in: Due to the small calibre of the bullet, most victims were shot twice, and at least 78 of them were shot three times; 395 of the victims found there had their skulls broken in addition to traces of gunshot trauma. Almost all men whose remains were excavated had their hands tied. Older women were dressed in some form of clothing, whereas younger victims were buried naked. The executions were clandestine; the families were not informed of their relatives' fate. Personal belongings, documents and trial documentation were not preserved and instead were buried in a separate pit not far from the mass graves. Later, after an investigation, Nazi Germany determined the Soviets were responsible for the massacre. = The investigation commission = The International commission investigating the mass murder in Vinnytsia, 1943 Mass graves for the victims The first examinations of the exhumed bodies were made by doctors such as professor Gerhard Schrader of the University of Halle-Wittenberg, docent Doroshenko of Vinnytsia, and professor Malinin of Krasnodar, respectively. The excavations started in May 1943 at three locations: the fruit orchard in the west, the central cemetery, and the People's Park. Most of the bodies were found in the fruit orchard (5,644 bodies). Altogether, 91 mass graves were discovered at the three locations, and 9,432 bodies were exhumed; 149 of them were women. The excavations at the People's Park were not finished, though many more bodies were thought to be buried there.Amtliches Material zum Massenmord von Winniza, p.83‚Äì86, 117. Archiv-Edition 1999 (Faksimile der 1944 erschienenen Ausgabe). After a preliminary investigation conducted by Professor Schrader's team, two teams of medical examiners were invited ‚Äî one international and the other made up of 13 experts from universities in Nazi Germany. An international commission of experts in anatomy and forensic pathology was invited from 11 countries in Europe, predominantly from Germany's allied or occupied states. The experts were the following:Amtliches Material zum Massenmord von Winniza, p.103.

The international commission visited the mass graves between July 13 and July 15, 1943. The Nazi German commission completed its report on July 29, 1943. Both commissions determined that almost all of the victims were executed by two shots in the back of the head between 1937‚Äì1938.About Crime in Vinnytsia Ukrainian society of the repressed. Peter Pavlovych 468 bodies were identified by people of Vinnytsia and the surroundings; the other 202 were identified on the basis of documents and evidence found in the graves. Most bodies that were identified this way naturally were Ukrainians; there were also 28 bodies that were identified as ethnic Poles.Amtliches Material zum Massenmord von Winniza, p.124, 215‚Äì248. Archiv-Edition 1999 (Faksimile der 1944 erschienenen Ausgabe). Naturally, there were no Jews there to identify their relatives among the corps. = Later history = Besides the international expert commission, several other international delegations visited the sites in mid-1943. Among them were politicians and other officials from Kingdom of Bulgaria, Occupied Denmark, Occupied Greece, Republic of Finland, and Kingdom of Sweden.Amtliches Material zum Massenmord von Winniza, p.6, 206‚Äì207. Archiv-Edition 1999 (Faksimile der 1944 erschienenen Ausgabe). Photos and results of the investigation were published in many countries in Europe, and were used by Nazi Germany in the propaganda war against the Soviet Union. Most of the bodies were reburied after a burial service led by metropolit Vissarion of Odessa. The service was also attended by many other Orthodox bishops and foreign church officials.Amtliches Material zum Massenmord von Winniza, p.124, 208‚Äì209. Archiv-Edition 1999 (Faksimile der 1944 erschienenen Ausgabe). A monument was also erected to the \\"Victims of Stalinist Terror\\". Later the Soviet authorities rededicated the monument to the \\"Victims of Nazi Terror\\", finally completely removing it and creating an entertainment park in its place. In the last ten years a new monument has been constructed at the burial site in the park; it only refers to \\"victims of totalitarianism\\". During Soviet times, information about the massacre was disseminated and investigated by the Ukrainian diaspora in the West. The mass murder in Vinnytsia returned as a critical topic in Ukraine in 1988.

This practice is widely used in the cultivation of crops such as rice, sugarcane, banana, and pineapple. Ratoon crops cannot be perennially renewed, and may be harvested only for a few seasons, as a decline in yield tends to occur due to increased crowding, damage by pests and diseases, and decreasing soil fertility. History The earliest record for ratooning, in a crop plant, can be traced back to the Vedic period in India. The Atharvaveda mentions that farmers cultivating barley (yava) used to cut barley plants many a times (20/125/2, Richa or Shloka No. 5755). Chinese records of sugarcane ratooning exist from 1757, in Fujian Province. Etymology The word \\"ratoon\\" probably owes its origin either from the Latin words retonsus, meaning \\"to cut down\\" or retono, which means \\"to thunder back\\" or \\"resound\\". In Spanish, the close words reto√±o/reto√±ar mean \\"sprout\\"/\\"to sprout\\". Terminology of ratooned crops varies, based on how far the crop extends from the original planting. The first harvest is called the \\"plant crop\\", \\"main crop\\" or \\"principal crop\\". Subsequent harvests are called \\"first ratoon\\", \\"second ratoon\\", etc. In sugarcane Ratooning is an ancient method of propagation in sugarcane in which subterranean buds on the stubble (the part of cane left underground after harvesting) give rise to a new crop stand, which is usually referred to as the 'ratoon' or the 'stubble crop' as opposed to 'plant crop', which is raised from seeds or seedlings. Ratooning reduces the cost of cultivation by dispensing with additional seed material and some cultural practices such as land preparation and preparatory irrigation (palewa). It also results in early ripening of canes by at least a month or so, thus it adds to the effective crushing period. Sugarcane has a tremendous ratooning potential, and the oldest cultivated ratoon, being ratooned since 1757, in East China, in Fujian Province, stands to its testimony. The number of ratoons in sugarcane production cycles varies throughout the world, i.e., from one plant crop in Indonesia and some parts of China, one plant crop and a ratoon crop in India, Fiji and some parts of China, to six or more successive ratoons in Mauritius, Cuba, Venezuela, clayey soils of Zimbabwe, some parts of Puerto Rico, etc. The later is also referred to as multiple ratooning. A decline in cane yield in successive ratoon crops, the so-called \\"ratoon decline\\", on the order of 20%, had been reported from many sugarcane-growing areas in India; the decline is more (up to 40% ) in subtropical India. Causes for this decline are: poor ratoon management, inherited differences in potential (ratoon) productivity, increasing incidence of diseases (like smut, grassy shoot disease, and red rot) which result in stands with gaps (studies conducted in India have shown that a gap over 10% significantly affects productivity of a ratoon crop), relatively less efficient enzyme systems (particularly nitrate reductase) activity, in vivo and prevalence of low temperatures during harvest, especially for early-ripening varieties and ratoon crop(s) in subtropical India which affects sprouting of stubble buds, etc. Insect pests also assume importance in a ratoon crop as: stubble acts as a 'carry-over' of the inocula of pests both for coming up ratoon and for the neighbouring sugarcane crop(s), improperly looked-after crop gets infested by a number of insect pests, emerging sprouts of a ratoon crop favour rapid development and multiplication of some of the insect pests, and insect associated with stubble affect sprouting causing gaps which ultimately affect productivity of the ratoon crop, per se. In Indian context, in subtropical India, ratoon initiated during spring (March) resulted in higher number of millable canes, cane yield and sucrose % juice in comparison to ratoon crops initiated either in winter (January) or summer (May). In peninsular India, however, as the sugarcane crop does not suffer extremes of weather conditions during summer and winters, differences in time of planting and harvest do not significantly influence the yield of succeeding ratoon crop. Such a decline could be effectively prevented by proper ratoon management. Need for the latter stems from the famous Kalai (Aligarh, India) experiments conducted during 1939-1949. A good example of ratoon management and multiple ratooning is from Hoshalli village (in district Shimoga, Karnataka, India) where good yields of sugarcane ratoon crop (125-134 t/ha) were harvested year after year since 1968 without much loss in cane yield and quality. The crux for such a success was trash mulching, application of lime and irrigation after harvest of the crop every year. Ratooning has now become so much important in sugarcane production system that ratooning ability has become one of the important selection criteria for release of sugarcane varieties for commercial cultivation. =Assessment of ratooning ability= Yield of ratoon crop is a function of yield potential and its ratooning ability. The latter, by and large, envisages the extent of multiple ratooning and their relative yield performance as compared to corresponding plant crop In India sugarcane varieties cultivated prior to introduction of Co varieties were not rationed because of their susceptibility to insect-pests and diseases. Incorporation of surya charan.S. spontaneum genome into modern sugarcane varieties has contributed to ratooning ability. The latter has been assessed by dry matter production of above ground parts at periodic harvests (at four-month intervals), the ratio of performance (of NMC and/or cane weight) of ratoon crop vs. plant crop. Characters like higher plant cane yield, stalk population and sprouting of stubble buds are useful in selecting good ratooners. Ratoon x environment interaction were high in varieties with poor ratooning ability and inherited differences in potential productivity appear to be responsible for ratoon decline. In Jamaica to calculate decline in ratoon productivity a Ratoon Performance Index (RPI) is used. In India, the second major sugarcane growing country, among the sugarcane varieties released and notified from 2000 to 2015 for commercial cultivation Co 85004, Co 2001‚Äì13, Co 2001-15 Co 0218, Co 0403, Co 86249, Co 0237, CoPk 05191 are good ratooners and CoPant 90223, CoS 95255, CoS 94270, CoSe 92423 have been rated to be the excellent ratooners. =Growth and development of ratoon crop vis-√†- vis plant crop= Buds on the lower half of the stubble give rise to most of the shoots in a ratoon. Initially, emerging shoots, for their development, depend on the nutrients stored in the stubble and for water supply on the roots attached to the stubble. Using the techniques of Panwar et al., roots remain active up to 106 days after harvest although they are relatively less efficient in nutrient uptake, possibly due to suberization and ageing. The new root system (shoot roots from the developing shoots) develop in 6‚Äì8 weeks after harvest subject to soil and weather conditions. Ghosh et al. observed that, per unit root weight, shoots developed relatively more in the settlings raised from stubble buds as compared to those from top cane buds. Experiment at Kalai (Aligarh, in sub-tropical India) indicated that the maximum number of tillers were attained by July and maximum number of canes (NMC) increased gradually in the subsequent ratoons and it was also associated with increased tiller mortality. In response to manuring, NMC gradually increased in succeeding ratoons. The average cane weight (ACW) is relatively lesser in ratoon crops and it gradually decreased in subsequent ratoons. Manuring also increased ACW by 62-75%. Interaction to space is relatively more pronounced in a ratoon crop as compared to its corresponding plant crop and perhaps due to this ratoon crops can tolerate a gap of 10% without any appreciable reduction in cane yield. Since optimal temperatures for tillering is 33.3‚Äì34.4¬∞C, winter-harvest of crop adversely affects tillering in an upcoming ratoon. If ratoon is initiated in April, tillering is profuse but mortality is high with poor growth of shoots. With successive ratooning, arrowing (flowering) increases. =Why a ratoon crop ripens earlier than its corresponding plant crop= A ratoon crop ripens earlier, in general, by at least one to one and a half months or so due to: early development of shoots, maintenance of relatively lesser N content in index tissues, rapid run-out of N during grand growth phase and relatively higher inorganic non-sugars in its juice. =Poor ratoon crops due to low temperature harvest= In subtropical India, in crops which are harvested from November to mid-January, due to prevalence of low temperatures result in poor sprouting of stubble buds and the succeeding ratoon crop is invariably poor. Buds located on the stubble remain dormant and sprout only when favourable temperatures are available in February. This could be managed by either foliar application of growth regulators before harvest of plant crop or giving some treatments to the stubble of the freshly harvested crop. In the former, among various treatments used application of Ethrel + urea was more effective. Among the later, treatments like (a) stubble protection by spreading polyethylene cover, loosening soil around stubble, and trash mulching and irrigation at 10‚Äì15 days interval, (b) maintaining optimal clump population by gap filling using dug-out stubble, pre-germinated settlings, sprouts from clumps in the growing ratoon crop, (c) improving cultural conditions by intercropping with suitable varieties of guar, cow pea, moong and potato and (d) application of growth regulating substances to the stubble of freshly harvested cane like Cycocel help to sustain ratoon productivity under such conditions. =Need for ratoon management= Need for ratoon management stems from its being an integral component of sugarcane production system, contributing to over half the cane acreage (it may increase when multiple ratooning is practiced); and as compared to corresponding plant crop, a ratoon crop has superficial roots, early shoot growth has to depend upon relatively less efficient root system (roots on the stubble), relatively less efficient enzyme system (especially the NRA), is infested/ infected more by insect-pests and diseases, ripens early and suffers ratoon decline. The ICAR-Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research, Lucknow has identified certain technologies for ratoon management like dismantling of ridges, stubble shaving and off-barring at initiation of ratoon; gap filling when there is more than 45 cm distance (gap) between clumps; paired-row system of planting (120p x30) to reduce gaps and optimize plant population; trash mulching in alternate rows so as to conserve soil moisture, manage weeds and maintain soil organic carbon, etc. They have also designed and developed a tractor operated two-row Ratoon Management Device (RMD) to perform field operations for ratoon cultivation such as stubble shaving, deep tilling, off-barring, application of manure, fertilizers, bio-agents, etc., and finally earthing-up in a single pass to manage ratoon crop (0.35-0.4 ha/h) so as to improve its productivity. It also saves 60% on the cost of cultivation. Studies on ratooning ability, overcoming ratoon decline, and early ripening of ratoons will be desirable in times to come. =Specific applications= The main benefits of ratooning are that the crop matures earlier (by one and half month or so) in the season and also decrease the cost of field preparation, preparatory irrigation as well as seed cane used for planting. By early maturing may increase the effective crushing duration of sugar mill adding to sugar production. At some places ratooning sugarcane (for short duration ratoon crops) has also been utilized to provide quality fodder for cattle. Multiple ratooning of sugarcane, with proper management including plant protection, may be utilized for maintaining purity of new improved varieties as well as genetically modified plants, for a longer period of time. Being endowed with high rates of CO2 fixation, enormous capacity for storage of soluble compounds, metabolic transformation systems and containment of its genes, ensured by its vegetative propagation make sugarcane a desirable plant for its use as a bio-industry for synthesis of value‚Äìadded products (molecular farming). Using biotechnological tools, the latter has been accomplished for the synthesis of p-hydroxy benzoic acid, sorbitol, and isomaltulose. In this endeavour, vast ratooning potential could be more helpful in containing desirable genes in such genetically modified plants for sufficiently longer rather more faithfully.  Other crops  Besides sugarcane, ratooning is also practiced commercially in many other crops. Examples include banana, cotton, mint, pearl millet, pigeon peas, pineapple, ramie, rice, and sorghum. Ratooning is frequently used on plants that will be processed for essential oils, fiber, and medicines. Ratooning is most often used with crops which are known to give a steady yield for three years under most conditions. For example, the woody desert shrub guayule, an alternative source of natural rubber, is first harvested at two years, then ratooned annually in spring with a final crop that includes both tops and roots. Rice is grown as a monocarpic annual plant. However, in tropical areas it can serve as a perennial, producing a ratoon crop, and may survive for up to 30 years.

It is implemented by the free and open-source library \`libva\`, combined with a hardware-specific driver, usually provided together with the GPU driver. VA- API video decode/encode interface is platform and window system independent but is primarily targeted at Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI) in X Window System on Unix-like operating systems (including Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris), and Android, however it can potentially also be used with direct framebuffer and graphics sub-systems for video output. Accelerated processing includes support for video decoding, video encoding, subpicture blending, and rendering. The VA-API specification was originally designed by Intel for its GMA (Graphics Media Accelerator) series of GPU hardware with the specific purpose of eventually replacing the XvMC standard as the default Unix multi-platform equivalent of Microsoft Windows DirectX Video Acceleration (DxVA) API, but today the API is no longer limited to Intel-specific hardware or GPUs. Other hardware and manufacturers can freely use this open standard API for hardware accelerated video processing with their own hardware without paying a royalty fee.  Overview  The main motivation for VA-API is to enable hardware- accelerated video decode at various entry-points (VLD, IDCT, motion compensation, deblocking) for the prevailing coding standards today (MPEG-2, MPEG-4 ASP/H.263, MPEG-4 AVC/H.264, H.265/HEVC, and VC-1/WMV3). Extending XvMC was considered, but due to its original design for MPEG-2 MotionComp only, it made more sense to design an interface from scratch that can fully expose the video decode capabilities in today's GPUs. = Supported hardware and drivers = As of 2019, VA-API is natively supported by:https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Hardware_video_acceleration * Intel Quick Sync open-source drivers for Linux * Mesa open-source drivers for AMD and Intel graphics cards * AMDGPU-PRO drivers for AMD graphics cards on Linux * Nvidia proprietary driver for Nvidia graphics cards on Linux * libva-vdpau- driver for cards supported by VDPAU = Supported video codecs = VA-API currently supports these video codecs in the official mainline version, but note that exactly which video codecs are supported depends on the hardware and the driver's capabilities. * MPEG-2 decode acceleration Main Profile * VC-1 / WMV3 decode acceleration Advanced Profile * MPEG-4 Part 2 (H.263) (a.k.a.

It corresponds to the phenomenon whereby one's brain extracts tones from everyday signals (including speech) and music, even if parts of the signal are masked by other sounds. Virtual pitch is contrasted to spectral pitch, which is the pitch of a pure tone or spectral component. Virtual pitch is called \\"virtual\\" because there is no acoustical correlate at the frequency corresponding to the pitch: even when a virtual pitch corresponds to a physically present fundamental (or first harmonic), as it often does in everyday harmonic complex tones, the exact virtual pitch depends on the exact frequencies of higher harmonics and is almost independent of the exact frequency of the fundamental. The term was coined by Professor Ernst Terhardt from Technical University of Munich in 1970.http://home.austin.rr.com/jmjensen/VirtualPitch.html Theory Virtual pitch is an experimentally established phenomenon in humans that can be mathematically described. In its basic form, given a series of pure tones whose frequencies correspond to a harmonic series, one will hear a virtual pitch near the fundamental frequency, even if there is no pure tone at that frequency. The perceptual salience (clarity, probability of noticing) of the virtual pitch depends on how closely the audible partials match lower harmonics above the virtual pitch. In Terhardt's pitch algorithm, virtual pitches are predicted by looking for subharmonic coincidences between audible partials in a complex tone - in other words, by looking for missing fundamentals. Virtual pitch can be visualized in the time domain by adding together sine waves corresponding to harmonics of a given fundamental and deleting the fundamental. The resulting wave has a period corresponding to the fundamental frequency, regardless of their phase relationship. However, in Terhardt's theory the virtual pitch does not depend on this period. Instead, it depends on relationships between spectral pitches. Terhardt rejected the idea of periodicity pitch, because it was not consistent with empirical data on pitch perception, e.g. measurements of the gradual shift of the virtual pitch of a complex tone with a missing fundamental when the partials were gradually shifted. Terhardt instead broke pitch perception into two steps: auditory frequency analysis in the inner ear, and harmonic pitch pattern recognition in the brain. The inner ear effectively performs a running frequency analysis of incoming sounds - otherwise we would not be able to hear out spectral pitches within a complex tone. Physiologically, each spectral pitch depends on both temporal and spectral aspects (i.e. periodicity of the waveform and position of excitation on the basilar membrane), but in Terhardt's approach the spectral pitch itself is a purely experiential parameter, not a physical parameter: it is the outcome of a psychoacoustical experiment in which the conscious listener plays an active role. Psychoacoustic measurements and models can predict which partials are \\"perceptually relevant\\" in a given complex tone; they are perceptually relevant if you can hear a difference in the whole sound if the frequency or amplitude of a partial is changed). The ear has evolved to separate spectral frequencies, because due to reflection and superposition in everyday environments spectral frequencies are more reliably carriers of environmental information than spectral amplitudes, which in turn are more reliable carriers of environmentally relevant information than phase relationships between partials (when perceived monoaurally). On this basis, Terhardt proposed that spectral pitches - which are what the listener experiences when hearing out partials (as opposed to the physical partials themselves) - are the only information available to the brain for the purpose of extracting virtual pitches. The \\"pitch extraction\\" process then involves the recognition of incomplete harmonic patterns and happens in neural networks.

Fed by runoff from a basin of about in Douglas and Lane counties, it is about south of Florence and east of U.S. Route 101. Its name comes from a Lower Umpqua (Siuslaw) placename, a variant of which is Tsiltcoos. The lake, with a mean elevation of above sea level, empties into the Siltcoos River, which meanders generally west for about to its mouth on the Pacific Ocean. River miles between the ocean and the lake are marked on the map. A dam about a half-mile downriver regulates the lake's outflow. Geology and biology Siltcoos Lake is a submerged remnant of a Siltcoos River delta that existed before the most recent ice age. The lake formed after melting glaciers caused a rise in sea level that drowned the lower reaches of Oregon's coastal rivers. Sediments from the sluggish rivers formed sand dunes, behind which the ancestral mouths of rivers like the Siltcoos became lakes. Nearby Woahink Lake and Tahkenitch Lake are similar remnants.Johnson, et al, p.144 Fed mainly by four small freshwater tributaries‚ÄîWoahink, Fiddle, Maple, and Lane creeks‚Äîthe lake is very shallow. About 80 percent of it is less than deep, and 32 percent of it consists of shoal areas. The shallowness contributes to the lake's eutrophic nature, related to extensive populations of Elodea, Myriophyllum, and other aquatic plants. A wide variety of warm- water fish thrive in the lake, where nutrients are plentiful, but these nutrients have also led historically to troublesome algal blooms. Some of the residents of Dunes City and nearby areas depend on the lake for drinking water. For 52 days in the fall of 2007, state and local authorities advised against domestic use of the lake water because of a dense bloom of Anabaena planktonica, a blue-green algal species that can produce toxins. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has placed the lake on its list of impaired water bodies because of its problems with algae. Recreation Siltcoos Lake is a popular destination for fishing and is home to many warm- water species as well as transient seagoing fish such as salmon and steelhead.

History Stagecoach London TransBus ALX400 bodied TransBus Trident in Leamouth in April 2013 Route 277 started in April 1959 to replace the Trolleybus route 677 from Smithfield to Cubitt Town. In October 1961 the Sunday service was extended from Cubitt Town to Poplar replacing the withdrawn route 56. In 1964 Saturday journeys were also extended, and this was followed in 1969 by a weekday extension. In 1971 route 277 saw the withdrawal on Sunday services between Angel and Smithfield but continued a normal service to the Blackwall Tunnel. The 277 saw the withdrawal of through services to Poplar and restricted to Cubitt Town, Queen Hotel in 1974, during the reconstruction of what is now the Blue Bridge over the West India Dock entrance from the River Thames, passengers walking over a temporary footbridge until 1976 after Route 277A, a shuttle from the north side of the bridge to Poplar, was withdrawn. The 1990s saw the most significant change to the route where the 277 lost it status as a Central London route as was diverted at Canonbury (Mildmay Park) via St Pauls Road to Highbury & Islington Station; the Smithfield section was replaced by bus route 56. 1991 saw the extension on weekdays and Saturdays to Canary Wharf. 1993 saw the withdrawal of the section between Canary Wharf and Poplar. In 1994 the route was extended to Blackwall, Leamouth on weekdays and Saturdays and saw the extension to Leamouth on Sundays along with the N277 in 2003 being introduced that covered the entire route. As part of the new 24 hour buses project in 2004, the 'N277' dropped as this was routed exactly the same as the day route, making the 277 a 24-hour route.

His recording of Yeagley's Wessi vah-peh, for Native American flute and orchestra, performed with the National Polish Radio Symphony Orchestra Katowice, will be released by Opus One Records in late 2008. He was the first person to use the old warble technique (in which a single flute tone \\"splits\\" into a multiphonic oscillation) within the context of contemporary classical music. Archambault is planning to record, in late 2008, a solo album of compositions by David Yeagley entitled Suite Tragique which is dedicated to the Kichesipirini Algonquin First Nation, as well as a collaborative composition utilizing traditional Anishinaabeg musical notation with the Navajo composer Raven Chacon. He recorded an orchestral work entitled The Choctaw Diaries by the Choctaw composer George Quincy, which was released by Lyrichord Classical on June 17, 2008. In 2008, he joined an all- Native American orchestra called The Coast Orchestra. As a composer, in the spring of 2007 he composed a work for solo cello for the Mohawk cellist, as a part of her North American Indian Cello Project; this work will be released on CD in late 2008. Archambault is a member of the First Nations Composer Initiative and performed at the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C. in November 2006. In August 2007, he recorded traditional Kichesipirini flute songs for the National Museum of the American Indian archives, and in 2008 he was one of the First Nations Composer Initiative judge panelists who awarded several grants to American Indian musicians. Architectural career Archambault lives in Beijing, China, where he is a project manager at the Beijing office of the Office for Metropolitan Architecture; he is currently designing a large-scale architectural project in Southeast Asia. Before taking this position he worked as a Project Architect in Rotterdam and New York City, working on the designs for the Prada Soho Store, the Lehmann Maupin Gallery in Chelsea, Manhattan (commissioned in 2001 and completed in 2002), and the Dee and Charles Wyly Theatre at the Dallas Center for the Performing Arts in Dallas, Texas (commissioned in 2004 and scheduled to be completed in 2008). Prior to joining OMA in 1999, and helping to establish its New York office, he worked for Pasanella+Klein Stolzman+Berg Architects in New York on the Pratt Stabile Hall Dormitory, and for Frank O. Gehry and Associates in Los Angeles on the Samsung Museum of Contemporary Art and the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Personal life Archambault is a hereditary senator of the Kichesipirini Algonquin First Nation, and is active in tribal issues, keeping close ties with the nation, which is based in Pembroke, Ontario.

Origins Wood, keen to trade on her previous stage success Talent, was commissioned to write another play by impresario Michael Codron. \\"I wrote one called Pals, which he said was 'very enjoyable'. This is a euphemism for wincing, so it went in the bin. I then wrote another called Good Fun.\\" Performance The play was first performed in April 1980 at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre. It was directed by David Leland. It starred Annabel Leventon as Liz, Charles McKeown as Frank, Gregory Floy as Mike, Victoria Wood as Lynne, Joe Figg as Kev, Julie Walters as Betty, Noreen Kershaw as Gail and Christopher Hancock as Maurice. The show was then performed at The Crucible Theatre again in June that year with some cast changes. Polly James played Liz, Sam Kelly played Frank and Meg Johnson played Betty. After The Crucible's second version, the plan was to transfer the play to the West End. Though this never happened, it was performed at the King's Head Theatre in Islington. Wood said she heard a man at the interval saying \\"It's a bit witty witty isn't it?\\" Wood's view of the play was that \\"there was an awful lot wrong with it but there were some lovely performances and the audiences enjoyed it.\\" After Good Fun Wood concentrated on television comedy and her career as a stand up comic. Though she did write two more plays \\"which to save bothering Michael Codron, I called 'very enjoyable' and put straight in the bin.\\" Reviews Robin Thurber of The Guardian said \\"Good Fun is just that... full of knowing little laughs.

U.S. savings bonds are considered one of the safest investments because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government.www.sec.gov The savings bonds are nonmarketable treasury securities issued to the public, which means they cannot be traded on secondary markets or otherwise transferable. They are redeemable only by the original purchaser, or a beneficiary in case of death. History Post WWII $25 Series E US Savings Bond (1953) and strip of 10¬¢ US Savings Stamps On February 1, 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed legislation that allowed the U.S. Department of the Treasury to sell a new type of security, called the savings bond, to encourage saving during the Great Depression. The first Series A savings bond was issued a month later, with a face value of $25. They were marketed as a safe investment that was accessible to everyone. Series B, C, and D bonds followed over the next few years. Series E bonds, referred to as Defensive Bonds, were a major source of financing in the period just before U.S. entry into World War II. On April 30, 1941, Roosevelt purchased the first Series E bond from Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr.; the next day, they were made available to the public. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Defensive Bonds became known as War Bonds. Stamps featuring a Minuteman statue design in denominations of 10¬¢, 25¬¢, 50¬¢, $1, and $5 were also sold to be collected in booklets which, when filled, could be exchanged to purchase interest-bearing Series E bonds. All the revenue received from the bonds went directly to support the war effort. After the war ended, savings bonds became popular with families, with purchasers waiting to redeem them so the bonds would grow in value. To help sustain post-war sales, they were advertised on television, films, and commercials. When John F. Kennedy was president, he encouraged Americans to purchase them, which stimulated a large enrollment in savings bonds. By 1976, President Ford helped celebrate the 35th anniversary of the U.S. savings bond program. In 1990, Congress created the Education Savings Bond program which helped Americans finance a college education. A bond purchased on or after January 1, 1990, is tax-free (subject to income limitations) if used to pay tuition and fees at an eligible institution. In 2002, the Treasury Department started changing the savings bond program by lowering interest rates and closing its marketing offices. As of January 1, 2012, financial institutions no longer sell paper savings bonds. That year, the Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt made savings bonds available for purchasing and redeeming online. U.S. savings bonds are now only sold in electronic form at a Department of the Treasury website, with the exception that paper Series I savings bonds can be purchased with a portion of a federal income tax refund using form 8888.Paper I Bonds As Income Tax Refund Accessed October 8, 2018  Types of bonds  There are two types of savings bonds offered by the Treasury, Series EE and Series I. =Series EE= $1,000 Series EE savings bond featuring Benjamin Franklin ' are guaranteed to double in value over the purchase price when they mature 20 years from issuance, though they continue to earn interest for a total of 30 years. Interest accrues monthly, and is compounded semiannually, that is, becomes part of the principal for future interest earning calculations. If a bond's compounded interest does not meet the guaranteed doubling of the purchase price, Treasury will make a one-time adjustment to the maturity value at 20 years, giving it an effective rate of 3.5%. The bond will continue to earn the fixed rate for 10 more years. All interest is paid when the holder cashes the bond. For bonds issued before May 2005, the interest rate was an adjustable rate recomputed every six months at 90% of the average five-year Treasury yield for the preceding six months. Bonds issued in May 2005 or later pay a fixed interest rate for the life of the bond.TreasuryDirect Savings Bond Rate Press Release Paper EE bonds, last sold in 2011, could be purchased for half their face value; for example, a $100 bond could be purchased for $50, but would only reach its full $100 value at maturity. =Series I= ' have a variable yield based on inflation. The interest rate consists of two components. The first is a fixed rate which will remain constant over the life of the bond; the second component is a variable rate adjusted every six months from the time the bond is purchased based on the current inflation rate. The fixed rate is determined by the Treasury Department; the variable component is based on the Consumer Price Index for urban areas (CPI-U) for a six-month period ending one month prior to the rate adjustment. New rates are published on May 1 and November 1 of every year. As an example, if someone purchases a bond in February, the fixed portion of the rate will remain the same throughout the life of the bond, but the inflation-indexed component will be based on the rate published the previous November. In August, six months after the purchase month, the inflation component will change to the rate that was published in May. During times of deflation, the negative inflation-indexed portion can drop the combined rate below the fixed portion, but the combined rate cannot go below 0% and the bond can not lose value. Like Series EE bonds, interest accrues monthly and is compounded to the principal semiannually. Besides being available for purchase online, taxpayers may purchase Series I bonds using a portion of their tax refund via IRS Form 8888. =Common terms= For both types, bonds are redeemable after 12 months, but there is a penalty of three months' interest if they are redeemed before 5 years. Tax on the interest is deferred until the bond is redeemed. The annual purchase limit for electronic Series EE and Series I savings bonds is $10,000 for each series. For paper Series I Savings Bonds purchased through IRS tax refunds the purchase limit is $5,000, which is in addition to the online purchase limit. =Series HH= Additionally, the Treasury formerly offered Series HH bonds, which were \\"current income\\" bonds. Unlike Series EE and I bonds, they did not increase in value, but paid earned interest every six months for 20 years directly to the holder. The interest rate of a Series HH bond was set at purchase and remained that rate for 10 years. After 10 years the rate could change, with the new rate for the remaining 10 year life of the bond. After 20 years, the bond would be redeemed for its original purchase price. Series HH bonds replaced Series H bonds, which were introduced in 1952. Issuance of Series HH bonds ended August 31, 2004. Although no longer sold, Series HH bonds continue to earn interest for 20 years after sale, meaning the last bonds will not mature until 2024. Further reading * Sarah L. Quinn. 2019.

Students for a Democratic Society After receiving her undergraduate degree Jaffe founded a chapter of the Students for a Democratic Society at The New School for Social Research where she was pursuing her graduate degree in sociology.Babcox During graduate school, she formed a friendship with future Weatherman, David Gilbert.Berger 39 While in the SDS, Jaffe worked for the independent publication New Left Notes and published an article about equal rights for women called \\"The Look Is You\\" coauthored with Bernardine Dohrn.Teodori 355 Jaffe, a known member of the group Women's International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell (W.I.T.C.H.),Berger 84 participated in the 1969 demonstrations at the Miss America Pageant in Atlantic City. The demonstrations were held to speak out against the consumer driven oppression of women, and to say that the Miss America Pageant perpetuated false stereotypes about the capabilities of women. In 1969, as a member and leading feminist of the SDS, Jaffe traveled with a group of people to Hanoi to talk to young Vietnamese about the American antiwar movement.U.S. Senate Subcommittee Weathermen In 1969, the SDS was heading in a more radical direction and Jaffe became one of the founding members of the Weatherman Organization, yet never became a leader.Berger 293 Jaffe joined the Weather Underground because the group believed in the self- determination of African American people; that they should have a revolution of their own without the total involvement of white middle class people. She also joined because the group was radically anti-racist and anti- imperialist.Berger 89 As quoted by historian Dan Berger, Jaffe says the Weather Underground was \\"the most vital show in town.\\" The organization was also aligned with her Marxist ideals. To join she had to set aside her feminist convictions, yet she always believed that the WUO should have focused more on women's liberation.Berger 291-292 In September 1969, she participated in \\"jailbreaks\\", actions in which high school students were encouraged to leave class and run through the halls as though they were being freed from the prison that was their school. This action was to gain support for the \\"Days of Rage\\" also called the National Action. She and 25 other Weatherwomen, including Cathy Wilkerson, were arrested in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for that act.Berger 101FBI File 380 From October 8‚Äì11, 1969 Jaffe participated in the \\"Days of Rage\\" in Chicago where members of the WUO, after having taken control of the SDS, ran through the streets smashing windows and causing chaos, she was arrested on October 11 for battery and resisting arrest. In 1970, Jaffe was indicted in Detroit, Michigan, for her participation in the 1969 Flint, Michigan War Council, the final public meeting of the Weatherman controlled SDS before the dissolution of the SDS in January 1970.Berger 123-124 According to scholarly researchers, such as Dan Berger, 13 people were indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit bombings and murders. These charges were later dropped.Berger 138, 242 =Underground= After the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion in March, 1970, Jaffe went underground. She found it necessary to cut her beloved long hair which she had been growing since childhood; she also cut ties with her tight-knit family because it was what she needed to do to become a revolutionary (or, simply, to elude capture by the FBI).\\"Weather Underground\\" documentary Although her whereabouts from 1970 to 1978 are mostly unknown, in 1971 the FBI lifted her fingerprints from an abandoned apartment in San Francisco, California. Summaries of surveillance files indicate that the apartment had been rented by Weathermen from 1970 to 1971 and contained bomb making material; the FBI called the apartment a bomb factory.FBI File 384 While underground Jaffe helped to design and publish Weather's short-lived publication, .Berger 213 Around 1975, while living on the East Coast, Jaffe expressed concerns about the direction the group was taking: because of her feminist background she most likely wanted them to refocus on women's issues, and this led to her becoming estranged from the group. She was living on her own and not in a collective, so when she showed up to a planned meeting and no one else showed, she realized she was out. Jaffe resurfaced in 1978.Thompson 155 In an unpublished critique of Prairie Fire, written soon after Weather split up, Jaffe wrote harshly about the problems with the Weather Underground's lack of focus on feminist issues.Berger 195 Recent history After she resurfaced, Jaffe spent a great deal of time reassessing her priorities as an activist. In the last 20 years, she has focused much of her attention on feminism, lesbian issues, and anti- racism in New York State. Today Jaffe is a mother of one son and lives in Albany, New York, with her life partner. Having continued a life of activism, Jaffe has worked on a local Free Mumia Committee and she is also the former Executive Director of the organization Holding Our Own, an anti-racist women's funding foundation.Thompson 154-155 Jaffe was also prominently featured in the 2002 documentary film The Weather Underground.

Early life  Segal was born to Jewish parents in Ia≈üi, Romania, and studied at the Berlin Academy from 1892. He studied with and H√∂lzel in Munich in 1896, and later studied in Paris and Italy in the early 1900s.  Career  After studying in Paris and Italy, he eventually moved to Berlin in 1904 where he exhibited his work with Die Brucke and Der Blaue Reiter, two leading German expression groups. In 1910 he co-founded the Neue Sezession, a group of artists whose work was rejected by the Berliner Sezession. On the outbreak of war in 1914 he moved to Ascona, Switzerland with his family, and remained there until 1920. During the war, Switzerland became a refuge for many artists like Segal, and whilst he was there he exhibited some of his work with Arp and Dada in the Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich. In 1920, he returned to Berlin, where he founded his own art school in 1923, Novembergruppe. He was offered a teaching job at the Bauhaus in Dessau, but he declined. Because of his Jewish background he was prevented from exhibiting his work in Germany,McLean Arts & Books - Browsing Artists and so in 1933 he moved to Palma, Majorca and then London, where he set up another school with his daughter Marianne. He died in London. Segal was firstly a painter, and his early work was heavily influenced by impressionism and neo- impressionism. From around 1910 he began a more expressionism and dadaism style, and around 1916 found his own modern style. As well as painting, he also produced woodcuts from 1910, many of which were anti-war themed. Segal was also the author of many books, articles, and often gave lectures. His son was the architect Walter Segal.

Gene  The human NCL gene is located on chromosome 2 and consists of 14 exons with 13 introns and spans approximately 11kb. The intron 11 of the NCL gene encodes a small nucleolar RNA, termed U20.  Function  Nucleolin is the major nucleolar protein of growing eukaryotic cells. It is found associated with intranucleolar chromatin and pre-ribosomal particles. It induces chromatin decondensation by binding to histone H1. It is thought to play a role in pre- rRNA transcription and ribosome assembly. May play a role in the process of transcriptional elongation. Binds RNA oligonucleotides with 5'-UUAGGG-3' repeats more tightly than the telomeric single-stranded DNA 5'-TTAGGG-3' repeats. Nucleolin is also able to act as a transcriptional coactivator with Chicken Ovalbumin Upstream Promoter Transcription Factor II (COUP-TFII).  Clinical significance  Midkine and pleiotrophin bind to cell-surface nucleolin as a low affinity receptor. This binding can inhibit HIV infection. Nucleolin at the cell surface is the receptor for the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) fusion protein. Interference with the nucleolin - RSV fusion protein interaction has been shown to be therapeutic against RSV infection in cell cultures and animal models.  Interactions  Nucleolin has been shown to interact with: * CSNK2A2, * Centaurin, alpha 1, * HuR, * NPM1, * P53, * PPP1CB, * S100A11, * Sjogren syndrome antigen B, * TOP1, and * Telomerase reverse transcriptase.

His son, physicist Erwin Madelung (1881‚Äì1972), discovered the Madelung constant.  Academic career  Madelung was born in Gotha. In 1869 he received his medical doctorate from the University of T√ºbingen, afterwards being assigned to a military hospital during the Franco-Prussian War. He later served as a surgical assistant in Bonn, and in 1873‚Äì74 worked as an assistant at the pathological clinic of Georg Eduard von Rindfleisch (1836‚Äì1908). In 1874 he visited Great Britain and the United States. In 1881 he became an assistant professor of surgery at the University of Bonn, followed by professorships at Rostock (from 1882) and Strasbourg (from 1894). After the French takeover of Strasbourg following World War I, Madelung was relieved of his duties, and he subsequently retired to G√∂ttingen, where he died.  Contributions in medicine  Otto Madelung is remembered for his work with an orthopedic disorder known as Madelung's deformity, defined as a progressive curvature of the radius bone in the forearm. The condition was earlier mentioned by Guillaume Dupuytren in 1834, Auguste N√©laton in 1847, and Joseph-Fran√ßois Malgaigne in 1855, however Madelung was the first physician to provide a comprehensive, clinical description. Madelung also described a benign form of lipomatosis, characterized by symmetrical deposits of adipose tissue in the area of the neck, shoulder girdle, arms, and upper trunk of the body. Today, this disorder goes by several names, including \\"benign symmetric lipomatosis\\", \\"Madelung's syndrome\\", and \\"multiple symmetric lipomatosis\\". If the condition is confined to the neck, it is sometimes referred to by the eponym \\"Madelung's neck\\". Madelung specialized in abdominal surgery, and is known for his pioneer work with intestinal anastomoses and laparotomy.  Written works  * Die spontane Subluxation der Hand nach Vorne.

Wilmut attended Warwick School, and began his 'day job' as studio technician for the BBC on leaving school in 1961. Wilmut claims to have drifted into a career as a writer \\"by accident\\". Wilmut's books include The Goon Show Companion, Tony Hancock: Artiste, From Fringe to Flying Circus (a history of Oxbridge comedy in the sixties and seventies) and Didn't You Kill My Mother-in-law (a history of the 1980s alternative Comedy movement in the UK). Early life Wilmut was born in Stratford Upon Avon, Warwickshire in 1942. His parents moved there when they were married in 1940 and his father, who had been teaching in Caterham, Surrey, got a post at King Edward VI School in Stratford. Wilmut's mother was a keen theatregoer, and as a result he saw many of the Shakespeare productions at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre from the late 1950s to about the early 1970s. Wilmut attended Warwick School, and began his 'day job' as studio technician for the BBC on leaving school in 1961. Career Wilmut's enthusiasm for the Goons led to the first of his books. In 1974, with the help of friends Tim Smith and Peter Copeland, he revised a list of the series' episodes supplied by the BBC, and his own earlier research, into a \\"much more complete typewritten list\\". He then sent it to Robson Books, who showed an interest. While writing the accompanying text he was \\"approached by the late Jimmy Grafton, who had been involved with the Goons in their early days, and had helped to get the show on the air. He suggested combining his memoirs with my book, and this is what happened, with the book being published in 1976 under the title The Goon Show Companion.\\" Wilmut was then signed by the agent Roger Hancock, who then commissioned him to \\"write a similar book about Tony Hancock\\", his elder brother. The result was 1978's Tony Hancock ‚Äì 'Artiste', the book for which he conducted his first interviews. Whilst considering a book on Monty Python's Flying Circus, Roger Hancock suggested that he cover \\"the entire generation of comedy which arose from Oxford and Cambridge Universities after 1961\\". The result was From Fringe to Flying Circus. It wasn't until 1985 that Wilmut's next book appeared, a history of theatrical variety, titled Kindly Leave The Stage. Over seventy people were interviewed for the project, with Wilmut remarking he thought he \\"ought to do the interviews as soon as possible in view of the age of the people involved.\\" In 1989 he produced Didn't You Kill My Mother-in-Law?, a history of British alternative comedy. The book was originally the idea of Peter Rosengard, a life insurance salesman who had helped start this comedy movement by opening The Comedy Store in London in 1979. Like Jimmy Grafton with The Goon Show Companion, the book was part memoir (this time Rosengard's), and part history of the subject by Wilmut. Other books by Wilmut are The Illustrated Hancock, and his compiling and editing of No More Curried Eggs For Me and Son of Curried Eggs (both anthologies of scripts for the likes of Yes Minister, The Goon Show and Rutland Weekend Television). He has also text edited the scripts for The Complete Beyond The Fringe and the Monty Python's Flying Circus complete script collection Just The Words (both volumes 1 and 2). He says of his time writing comedy books, \\"it was, on the whole, fun to do and well worth doing ‚Äì particularly when you consider that all I was trying to do in the first place was type out a list of just one radio show.\\" The Guardian had From Fringe to Flying Circus and Didn't You Kill My Mother-In-Law in its \\"top 10 books about comedians\\". Wilmut is nowadays a collector of gramophone records and ran a podcast on the subject titled The Sound of 78s.

He founded \\"R. A. Brierley Investments\\" (BIL; from October 2007 GuocoLeisure ) in March 1961 with no capital. By 1984 BIL was the largest company in New Zealand by market capitalization, and in 1987 had 160,000 shareholders, with a stake in over 300 companies, including Paris department store Galleries Lafayette and Air New Zealand. Personal life Brierley was born in Wellington during 1937 to middle-class parents. He went to primary school at Island Bay School, and Wellington College. At Wellington College he joined the New Stamp Dealers Federation, and began his first business venture selling stamps to students and staff. He is still one of the largest buyers and sellers of stamps in the world, and he is recognised by the name \\"Lionheart\\".Mark Russell, 'Lionheart' caught up in fight for stamps', The Age, 23 June 2014, p. 13 Brierley's investiture as a Knight Bachelor by the Governor-General, Sir Paul Reeves, at Government House, Wellington, in May 1988Brierley is a fan of cricket, being a Trustee of the Sydney Cricket and Sports Ground Trust 1988‚Äì96, and President of New Zealand Cricket in 1995. He also likes travelling by train. He was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 1988 New Year Honours, for services to business management and the community. On 18 December 2019 various news outlets reported that Brierley had been arrested in Sydney on charges of possession of child pornography. Business career =Early career= Brierley began his career as the publisher of a horse racing tip sheet. He followed this with an investment analysis newsletter \\"Stocks and Shares\\" which he founded in 1956 at age 19. This sought to identify undervalued special situations and suggest what could be done with the companies. His first bid via R.A.Brierley Investments Ltd was for the Otago Farmers Co-Operative Association in July 1961, which had become attractive as a target due to its cheapness, its unusual legal structure and the company being moved to an unofficial NZX bourse due to failing to comply with exchange listing requirements. While Brierley's offer was rejected, the company was forced into a change in policy and the market price of the company leapt upwards. Other targets of Brierley's activist investment style in the 1960s and 1970s included the Southern Cross Building Society, the Finance Corporation of New Zealand, Citizens and Graziers and the Southern Farmers Co- operative Ltd in Australia. Many of these companies shares similar traits in that they were largely family controlled, inefficient, with lazy balance sheets, complacent management and surplus assets. Brierley's view was that his holding company, Brierley Investments Ltd, was \\"a monitoring organisation that continually evaluated the performance of various companies and acted as a catalyst to promote the most effective ownership of a company.\\" =Post BIL= On 29 March 1990 Brierley was appointed chairman of investment holding company Guinness Peat Group (GPG). As chairman Brierley publicly attacked and defeated the plan to merge the London Stock Exchange with Deutsche B√∂rse in 2001. In December 2015 Brierley, through his new company, Mercantile Investments, launched a hostile takeover of Australian shipping company Richfield International.

The preselector is a band-pass filter that blocks troublesome out-of-tune frequencies from passing through from the antenna into the radio receiver (or preamplifier) that otherwise would be directly connected to the antenna. Purpose A preselector improves the performance of nearly any receiver, but is especially helpful to receivers with broadband front-ends that are prone to overload, such as scanners and ordinary consumer-market shortwave and AM broadcast receivers. Frequency response curves for a simple preselector with tuning capacitor setting of 10, 30, 100, or 300 pF A preselector typically is tuned to have a narrow bandwidth, centered on the receiver‚Äôs operating frequency. The preselector passes through the signal on the frequency it is tuned to unchanged (or only slightly diminished) but it reduces or removes off-frequency signals, cutting down or eliminating unwanted interference. Extra filtering can be useful because the first input stage (‚Äúfront end‚Äù) of receivers contains at least one RF amplifier, which has power limits (dynamic range). Most radios‚Äô front ends amplify all radio frequencies delivered to the antenna connection. So off-frequency signals constitute a load on the RF amplifier, using part of its dynamic range for unused signals. ‚ÄúLimited dynamic range‚Äù means that the amplifier circuits have a limit to the total amount of incoming RF signal they can amplify without overloading, symptoms of which are nonlinearity and ultimately clipping. When the front-end overloads, the performance of the receiver is severely reduced, and in extreme cases can damage the receiver. In situations with noisy and crowded bands, or where there are strong local stations, the dynamic range of the receiver can quickly be exceeded. Extra filtering by the preselector limits frequency range and power demands that are applied to all later stages of the receiver, only loading it with signals within the preselected band. =Multifunction preselectors= A preselector can be engineered so that in addition to attenuating interference from unwanted frequencies, it will perform other services which may be helpful for a receiver: It can limit input signal voltage to protect a sensitive receiver from damage caused by static discharge, nearby voltage spikes, and overload from nearby transmitters‚Äô signals. It can also incorporate a small radio frequency amplifier stage to boost the filtered signal. None of these extra conveniences are necessary for the function of preselection, and for typical use, an amplifier in the preselector serves no helpful purpose. Antenna preamplifiers (preamps) can be made ‚Äútunable‚Äù by incorporating a front-end preselector circuit to improve their performance. The integrated device is both a preamplifier and a preselector, and either name is correct. This ambiguity sometimes leads to confusion ‚Äì conflating preselection with amplification. An ordinary preselector is called a ‚Äúpassive‚Äù preselector to clearly specify that it has no internal amplifier and requires no power supply. ‚ÄúPassive‚Äù preselectors typically work well with modern receivers, with no noticeable signal-loss. = Preselect filter bank = Spectrum analyzers and some wideband software- defined radio receivers incorporate a bank of switchable preselectors to reject out-of-band signals that could result in spurious signals at the frequencies being analyzed. In the case of software-defined radio receivers, many of which have limited dynamic range, a preselect filter bank also serves to limit strong out-of-band signals that could potentially saturate the receiver front-end. Bandwidth vs. signal strength trade-off With all preselectors there is some loss at the tuned frequency; usually, most of the loss is in the inductor (the tuning coil). Tuning the preselector for narrower bandwidth (or higher , or greater selectivity) increases this loss. Most preselectors have separate settings for an inductor and (at least) one capacitor. So with at least two adjustments available to tune to just one frequency, there are often a variety of settings that will tune the preselector to a frequency in its middle-range. For the narrowest bandwidth (highest ), the preselector is tuned using the highest inductance and lowest capacitance for the desired frequency, but this produces the greatest loss. It also requires retuning the preselector more often while searching for faint signals, to keep the preselector‚Äôs pass-through frequency close to the radio‚Äôs receiving frequency. For lowest loss (and widest bandwidth), the preselector is tuned using the lowest inductance and highest capacitance (and the lowest , or least selectivity) for the desired frequency. The wider bandwidth allows more interference through from nearby frequencies, but reduces the need to retune the preselector while tuning the receiver, since any one low-inductance setting for the preselector will pass a wide range of nearby frequencies. Different from an antenna tuner Although a preselector is placed in the same location as an antenna tuner, it serves a different purpose: An antenna tuner or ‚Äútransmatch‚Äù connects two signal lines with different signal impedances and only blocks out-of-tune frequencies incidentally (if it blocks any at all). A transmatch matches transmitter impedance to feedline impedance, so that signal power from the radio transmitter smoothly transfers into the antenna‚Äôs feed cable; a properly adjusted transmatch prevents transmitted power from being reflected back into the transmitter (called ‚Äòbacklash current‚Äô). Some antenna tuner circuits can both impedance match and preselect, for example the Series Parallel Capacitor (SPC) tuner, and many circuits used in balanced line (BLT) tuners can be adjusted to also function as band-pass filters.

The number and territorial extent of the districts varied over time, as did their subdivision into sub- districts. In Arabic, a district was known as a min·π≠aqah (ŸÖŸÜÿ∑ŸÇÿ©, plural mana·π≠iq ŸÖŸÜÿßÿ∑ŸÇ), while in Hebrew it was known as a mahoz (◊û◊ó◊ï◊ñ, plural mehozot ◊û◊ó◊ï◊ñ◊ï◊™). Each district had an administration headed by a District Governor, a role renamed as District Commissioner in 1925.Peel Commission report, p. 159 Sub-districts were managed by an Assistant District Commissioner. They were aided by a District Officer, who was typically either Jewish or Arab, based on the ethnic make-up of the sub-district. By the end of the mandate period, Palestine was divided into 6 districts and 16 subdistricts.  Administrative divisions prior to 1922  Until June 1920, Palestine was under a formal military regime called O.E.T.A. (South).

Jackson (born March 29, 1964) is a member of the Maryland House of Delegates representing District 27B in Calvert and Prince George's counties. Jackson is also the former Sheriff of Prince George's County, Maryland. Early life and education Jackson was born on March 29, 1964. He attended Crossland High School in Temple Hills, Maryland. From 1982 to 1985, Jackson served in the United States Marine Corps Reserve. In 1986, he received his B.S. in electronic engineering technology from the DeVry Institute of Technology and graduated from the PELP (Police Executive Leadership Program) master's program at Johns Hopkins University. Career =In the Legislature= Jackson was first elected to the Maryland House of Delegates in November 2014 and was sworn in January 2015. He was assigned to the Appropriations committee and serves on its Public Safety and Administration and its Oversight on Pensions sub-committees. In 2019 he was selected to be the House chair of the Joint Committee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology and Biotechnology. He is the chairman of the Prince George's County Delegation and a member of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland. =Sheriff of Prince George's County= After joining the Prince George's County Sheriff's Office, Jackson became the Fraternal Order of Police 112/DSA union president. In 2002, Jackson won the election for county sheriff by a narrow margin against the incumbent sheriff, Alonzo D. Black. Jackson was also the President of the Maryland Sheriff's Association until his retirement in 2010. Jackson is a member of the American Legion post 275; is a member of the Moose Lodge 453 and the Mitchellville Kiwanis Club. His 2010 campaign for County Executive of Prince George's County was unsuccessful when he lost to Rushern Baker. Jackson's department created the first 24-hour domestic- violence unit in the State of Maryland He is a recipient of the 2008 Victims' Rights Caucus Award, and the Allied Profession Award. In 2007, he also received the Maryland Network Against Domestic Violence, Law Enforcement Officer of the Year Award. His department also received the 2007 Governor's Award. Pursuant to Maryland Common Law, Jackson's position as the elected sheriff made him the senior law enforcement official of his jurisdiction and his authority superseded all others within the county.2006-2007 Edition Maryland Criminal Laws & Motor Vehicle Handbook with Related Statutes including Legal Guidelines, (c) 2006 Gould Publications Jackson, a Democrat, served for two terms, from 2002 to 2010. The area that he served contains an estimated 820,852 residents, holds the Washington Redskins Stadium (Fedex Field, the largest stadium in the NFLStadiums of the NFL-FedEx Field- Washington Redskins ), the University of Maryland, College Park, and the National Harbor.Contact Information Although violent crimes had dropped since 2006, in 2007, Prince George's County reported over 130 homicides, the highest rate of any county in Maryland. Berwyn Heights mayor's residence drug raid In July 2008, Jackson's agency, investigating a drug-smuggling ring, raided a private residence in Berwyn Heights, Maryland, handcuffing and interrogating those inside, and shooting two dogs. Almost immediately afterward, the home was revealed to be that of Cheye Calvo, the mayor of Berwyn Heights. The incident ignited much local and national controversy, with allegations of excessive force, civil rights violations, and failure to co- ordinate with the Berwyn Heights Police Department. Jackson spoke at a number of press conferences following the incident, in defense of his Department's role in the raid. Despite the controversy, the department did not officially clear the Calvos of wrongdoing until 2010. While an internal investigation by the Sheriff's department claimed to have found no wrongdoing, and Sheriff Jackson publicly praised the officers involved, a lawsuit was filed, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation is monitoring the situation, as part of a civil rights review requested by the Calvos. In addition, Maryland Senator Thomas V. \\"Mike\\" Miller said, \\"The people of Prince George's County demand better\\" and also stated that he pleaded with Jackson to make an adequate apology for the incident. It took more than a year for Sheriff Jackson to offer any kind of apology whatsoever. In August 2010 while campaigning to be elected county executive, Jackson stated, \\"We've apologized for the incident, but we will never apologize for taking drugs off our streets,\\" adding \\"Quite frankly, we'd do it again. Tonight.\\" Prince George's County settled the lawsuit in 2011, paying an undisclosed sum to Calvo, and agreeing to create new regulations on the treatment of animals and the deployment of SWAT teams. Family dog killed while serving eviction notice Two days after the Jackson said, \\"Quite frankly, we'd do it again. Tonight.\\", another family dog was killed by one of his deputies. The deputy was supposed to wait for animal control to arrive but failed to follow proper procedures for serving an eviction. As a result, another county resident, Donna Williams of Forest Heights was the latest victim of what Mayor Calvo said, \\"is part of a pattern.\\" According to county spokeswoman Sergeant Yakeisha Hines, \\"the only reason Animal Control is asked to be on scene, is to take possession of the dog after the family is evicted.\\" In this case, Sheriff Jackson's agency was not evicting Donna Williams, but only serving her with an eviction notice.

Biography Mawe was born in Derby in 1764 to Samuel Maw(e). His mother died when he was ten and he was raised by his father's second wife, Francis (born Beigton). In early life he appears to have spent fifteen years at sea. In 1790, he became captain of the merchant vessel Trent, trading to St Petersburg. In 1793, Mawe was apprenticed to the Derby mason Richard Brown (1736‚Äì1816), and married his daughter, Sarah, on 1 November 1794. Brown & Mawe was the name of the retail business near Covent Garden in 1797 which sold objects created from Derbyshire marble at the factory in Derby. Mawe was manager of this business. This business was established in 1794. Geological diagrams of Derbyshire strata which are made from Derbyshire minerals were once thought to have all been created by White Watson but it is now thought likely that some of these objects in Derby Museum were actually created by Mawe & Brown. About the end of the century he made a tour of most of the mines in England and Scotland, collecting minerals for the cabinet of the king of Spain. In 1800 he owned the Royal Museums spar shop in Matlock Bath which, through his agent, he was to enter into dispute with Thomas Pearson concerning surrounding mines.Further notes on the history of phosgenite and matlockite from Matlock, England, Peter S. Burr in the Mineralogical Record, January 1994, accessed 21 November 2007 In August 1804 he started on a \\"voyage of commercial experiment\\" to Rio de la Plata funded by Portugal's Prince Regent. His missions was to assess the value of the gold and diamond industries that might revitalize Brazil's ailing economy. Mawe had reached Cadiz when war broke out between England and Spain, and he was blockaded in the town where he was taken ill and nearly died. He sailed from Cadiz in March 1805 for Montevideo, and on reaching that town was imprisoned as an English spy. He procured his liberty soon after, but was interned, and did not obtain his release till the capture of Montevideo by William Beresford in 1806. He accompanied the expedition under John Whitelocke to Buenos Aires, and on his return to Montevideo purchased a schooner and sailed to Brazil, putting in at various ports on the way, including the island of Santa Catarina. He was well received in Brazil by the prince regent, who gave him permission to visit the diamond mines of Minas Gerais and other parts of the interior during 1809‚Äì10, and also granted him access to the government archives. J Mawe's Museum at Matlock Bath. Mawe returned to London in 1811, and opening a shop in The Strand, close to Somerset House, became well known as a practical mineralogist. In 1813 he was elected to the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall, and in 1817 he received the diploma of the Jena Mineralogischen Gesellschaft. Mawe and his wife Sarah had two children, a son and a daughter. Their son, John Saint Mawe (1797‚Äì1820), died aged 22; Sarah requested in her will that she be buried beside him. Their daughter married Anthony Tissington Tatlow (1789‚Äì1828), who became a partner of Mawe's in a shop in Cheltenham in 1816. Mawe died in London on 26 October 1829. A tablet to his memory is in Castleton church, Derbyshire. His business was carried on by James Tennant the mineralogist, in partnership with Mawe's widow Sarah until 1840. Sarah Mawe had the title of \\"Mineralogist to Her Majesty\\" until she retired.

Administratively the island forms the town of Kikai, Kagoshima Prefecture. Much of the island is within the borders of the Amami Gunt≈ç Quasi-National Park. Geography Kikaijima is isolated from the other Amami islands, and is located approximately east of Amami ≈åshima and approximately south of the southern tip of Ky≈´sh≈´. It is the easternmost island in the Amami chain. Compared with Amami ≈åshima and Tokunoshima, Kikaijima is a relatively flat island, with its highest point at above sea level. It is a raised coral island with limestone cliffs, and draws the attention of geologists as it is one of the fastest rising coral islands in the world. The climate of Kikaijima is classified as has a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cfa) with very warm summers and mild winters. The rainy season lasts from May through September. The island is subject to frequent typhoons. Flora and fauna Due it is relative isolation, Kikaijima is home to several rare species endemic to the island itself, or more generally to the Ryukyu archipelago. However, it is one of the few islands in the Amami chain to which the habu poisonous viper is not indigenous. Larger coated nodules (25-130 mm in diameter), named macroids, have been found off Kikai-jima shelf, at water depths of 61 to 105 m.Bassi D., Iryu Y., Humblet M., Matsuda H., Machiyama H., Sasaki K., Matsuda S., Arai K., Inoue T., Recent macroids on the Kikai-jima shelf, Central Ryukyu Islands, Japan Sedimentology, vol. 59, pp. 2024-2041, 2012 These macroids are made up by encrusting acervulind foraminifera. These macroids host boring bivalves whose holes represent the ichnogenus Gastrochaenolites.Bassi D., Braga J.C., Owada M., Aguirre J., Lipps J.H., Takayanagi H., Iryu Y., Boring bivalve traces in modern reef and deeper water macroid and rhodolith beds Progress in Earth and Planetary Science, vol. 7, 2020 History Although the Ryukyu Islands appeared in written history as Japan's southern frontier, the name of Kikaijima was not recorded in early years. The Nihongi ryaku (c. 11th‚Äì12th centuries) states that in 998 Dazaifu, the administrative center of Ky≈´sh≈´ ordered Kikajima (Ë≤¥ÈßïÂ≥∂) to arrest the Nanban (southern barbarians), who in the previous year had pillaged a wide area of western Ky≈´sh≈´. The Nanban were identified as Amami islanders by the Sh≈çy≈´ki (982‚Äì1032 for the extant portion). Accordingly, it is assumed that Dazaifu had a stronghold in the Kikaijima concerned.Takanashi Osamu È´òÊ¢®‰øÆ, Rett≈ç nan'en ni okeru ky≈çkai ry≈çiki no y≈çs≈ç ÂàóÂ≥∂ÂçóÁ∏Å„Å´„Åä„Åë„ÇãÂ¢ÉÁïåÈ†òÂüü„ÅÆÊßòÁõ∏, Kodai makki Nihon no ky≈çkai Âè§‰ª£Êú´Êúü„ÉªÊó•Êú¨„ÅÆÂ¢ÉÁïå, pp. 85‚Äì130, 2010 The Shinsarugakuki, a fiction written by an aristocrat Fujiwara no Akihira in the mid-11th century, introduced a merchant named Hachir≈ç-mauto, who traveled all the way to the land of the Fush≈´ in the east and to Kika-no-shima (Ë≤¥Ë≥Ä‰πãÂ≥∂) in the west. Some articles of 1187 of the Azuma Kagami state that during the period of the Taira clan's rule, Ata Tadakage of Satsuma Province fled to Kikaijima (Ë≤¥Êµ∑Â≥∂). The Azuma Kagami also states that in 1188 Minamoto no Yoritomo, who soon became sh≈çgun, dispatched troops to pacify Kikaijima (Ë≤¥Ë≥Ä‰∫ïÂ≥∂). It was noted that the imperial court objected to the military expedition claiming that it was beyond Japan's administration. The Tale of the Heike (13th century) depicted Kikaijima (È¨ºÁïåÂ≥∂), where Shunkan, Taira no Yasuyori, and Fujiwara no Naritsune were exiled following the Shishigatani Incident of 1177. The island depicted, characterized by sulfur, is identified as Satsuma I≈çjima of the ≈åsumi Islands, which is part of Kikai Caldera. There are some controversies over which Kikaijima described in these sources refers to. It may be the modern-day Kikaijima, Satsuma I≈çjima or a collective name for the southern islands. From the late 10th century, Kikaijima was seen as the center of the southern islands by mainland Japan.Takanashi Osamu È´òÊ¢®‰øÆ, Gusuku isekigun to Kikai-ga- shima Âüé‰πÖÈÅ∫Ë∑°Áæ§„Å®„Ç≠„Ç´„Ç§„Ç¨„Ç∑„Éû, Nichiry≈´ B≈çeki no reimei Êó•Áêâ‰∫§Êòì„ÅÆÈªéÊòé, pp. 121‚Äì149, 2008 It is also noted by scholars that the character representing the first syllable of Kikai changed from \\"Ë≤¥\\" (noble) to \\"È¨º\\" (ghost) from the end of the 12th century to the early 13th century. Archaeologically speaking, the Gusuku Site Complex, discovered in Kikaijima in 2006, rewrites the history of the Ryukyu Islands. The group of archaeological sites on the plateau is one of the largest sites of the Ryukyu Islands of the era. It lasted from 9th to 13th centuries and at its height from the second half of the 11th to the first half of the 12th century. It was characterized by a near-total absence of the native Kaneku Type pottery, which prevailed in coastal communities. What were found instead were goods imported from mainland Japan, China and Korea. Also found was the Kamuiyaki pottery, which was produced in Tokunoshima from the 11th to 14th centuries. The skewed distribution of Kamuiyaki peaked at Kikaijima and Tokunoshima suggests that the purpose of Kamuiyaki production was to serve it to Kikaijima. The Gusuku Site Complex supports the literature-based theory that Kikaijima was a trade center of the southern islands. In 1306, Chikama Tokiie, a deputy jit≈ç of Kawanabe District, Satsuma Province on behalf of the H≈çj≈ç clan, the de facto ruler of the Kamakura shogunate, created a set of documents that specified properties to be inherited by his family members, which included Kikaijima, together with other islands of the ≈åsumi, Tokara and Amami Islands.Murai Sh≈çsuke Êùë‰∫ïÁ´†‰ªã, Ch≈´sei kokka no ky≈çkai to Ry≈´ky≈´, Emishi ‰∏≠‰∏ñÂõΩÂÆ∂„ÅÆÂ¢ÉÁïå„Å®ÁêâÁêÉ„ÉªËù¶Â§∑, Ky≈çkai no Nihon-shi Â¢ÉÁïå„ÅÆÊó•Êú¨Âè≤, pp. 106‚Äì137, 1997. After the fall of the Kamakura shogunate, the southern islands seem to have been transferred to the Shimazu clan. It claimed the jito of the Twelve Islands, which were limited to the ≈åsumi and Tokara Islands. However, when Shimazu Sadahisa, the head of the clan, handed over Satsuma Province to his son Morohisa in 1363, he added the extra Five Islands as the territories to be succeeded, which seem to refer to the Amami Islands including Kikaijima.Nagayama Sh≈´ichi Ê∞∏Â±±‰øÆ‰∏Ä, Kodai ch≈´sei ni okeru Satsuma Nant≈ç kan no k≈çry≈´ Âè§‰ª£„Éª‰∏≠‰∏ñ„Å´„Åä„Åë„ÇãËñ©Êë©„ÉªÂçóÂ≥∂Èñì„ÅÆ‰∫§ÊµÅ, Ky≈çkai no Nihon-shi Â¢ÉÁïå„ÅÆÊó•Êú¨Âè≤, pp. 145‚Äì150, 1997. Kikaijima was conquered by the Ry≈´ky≈´ Kingdom. The Haedong Jegukgi (1471), whose source was a Japanese monk visiting Korea in 1453, describes Kikaijima as a territory of Ry≈´ky≈´. An article of 1462 in the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, which records an interview from a Jeju islander who had drifted to Okinawa in 1456, states that Kikaijima was resisting Ry≈´ky≈´'s repeated invasions. According to the Ch≈´zan Seikan (1650), King Sh≈ç Toku himself pacified Kikaijima in 1466, claiming that Kikaijima had not paid tribute for years.Takahashi Ichir≈ç È´òÊ©ã‰∏ÄÈÉé, Umi no Ko-Amami Êµ∑„ÅÆÂè§Â•ÑÁæé, Nichiry≈´ B≈çeki no reimei Êó•Áêâ‰∫§Êòì„ÅÆÈªéÊòé, pp. 151‚Äì181, 2008. As a result of Satsuma Domain's conquest of the Ry≈´ky≈´ Kingdom of 1609, Kikaijima fell under the direct control of Satsuma. After the Meiji Restoration it was incorporated into ≈åsumi Province and later became part of Kagoshima Prefecture. Following World War II, although with the other Amami Islands, it was occupied by the United States until 1953, at which time it reverted to the control of Japan. Transportation Kakaijima is connected by regular ferry service to Kagoshima, Amami-Oshima and various of the Amami islands. Kikai Airport connects the island with Amami-Oshima and Kagoshima by air. Economy The economy of the island is based on agriculture (primarily sugar cane and citrus fruits) as well as commercial fishing. Seasonal tourism also plays a role in the local economy. Industry is limited to sugar refining and Sh≈çch≈´ production. Strategic location The Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force maintains an important SIGINT station on the island, which includes a large Circularly Disposed Antenna Array. The station was opened in 2006, and is considered a vital component of the MSDF's JOSIS (JMSDF Ocean Surveillance Information System). Language The traditional local language, a Ryukyuan language known as Kikai or Kikai-Ryukyuan, is deemed endangered, with younger generations having only limited knowledge of it, or being monolingual in Japanese.Endangered Languages Archive, SOAS, University of LondonEthnologue References *Eldridge, Mark.

The album features collaborations with Zo√´ Johnston, Richard Bedford, Carrie Skipper and progressive trance producer Andy Moor. The first single from the album, \\"Air for Life\\", was released on 18 July 2005, and was voted Tune of the Year in 2005 on Armin Van Buuren's A State of Trance radio show. The single \\"Good For Me (Above & Beyond Club Mix)\\", featuring Zo√´ Johnston was voted Tune of the Year in 2006 on A State of Trance. During New Year's Eve in 2007, Above & Beyond performed at Barra Beach, Rio de Janeiro, to an estimated crowd of a million people where they showcased tracks from Tri-State along with their previous singles. Later that year, a remix album, Tri-State Remixed, was released. Critical reception Jon O' Brien from AllMusic described the album as \\"echoing the sleek, electronic rhythms, melodic vocals, and lush, ethereal production of BT and Delirium\\", whose tracks are a \\"combination of uplifting club anthems and hypnotic instrumentals\\". BBC's Andy Puleston wrote that together with singles \\"Air For Life\\" and \\"Alone Tonight\\", Tri-State was a \\"sterling effort\\" to create a record that defines trance music the same way Faithless and Orbital did with their respective genres, but nevertheless \\"does little to deviate or expand on the brief\\". In a 10-year-anniversary revisit of the album, Christina Hernandez from Dancing Astronaut dubbed \\"Good For Me\\" as \\"one of Above & Beyond‚Äôs top pieces of all time\\", and noted Richard Bedford's vocals on \\"Alone Tonight\\" whose \\"voice on it will continue to be listed among Above & Beyond‚Äôs most memorable compositions\\". She also called \\"Can't Sleep\\" as a \\"winning track from Tri-State\\", having been nominated to the top three trance tracks of 2006 on A State of Trance.

With historic Fort McHenry (former Fort Whetstone dating from the American Revolutionary War) from the War of 1812 (1812-1815), to the southeast at the point itself and additional residential areas surrounding the high school in tightly packed rowhouses and streets known as Locust Point and Riverside to the south and southeast along with the restored Otterbein and Sharp-Leadenhall neighborhoods to the west, also just south of the downtown central business district and famed \\"Inner Harbor\\" of the City of Baltimore, in Maryland. The old Southern High complex of buildings faces historic Federal Hill Park across the street to the north, overlooking the current tourist attractions of the Inner Harbor of the former industrial/commercial \\"Basin\\" of the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River dating as a port since 1706, as Baltimore Harbor. S.H.S. was originally built in 1910 as one of the first of a new national type of school becoming popular in American public education by the 1920s organizing grades seven, eight and nine together, then known as the \\"junior high school\\" (later reorganized, advanced earlier by a grade and known as \\"middle schools\\" for the 6th-7th-8th grades by the 1980s) and had a co-ed student body with both boys and girls for the first time in Baltimore City, which previously only had four specialized/college preparatory/citywide, sex-segregated (single sex) public high schools - with all-male: Baltimore City College (1839), Baltimore Polytechnic Institute (1883), and the all-female: Western High School (1844), Eastern High School (1844), since the beginnings of the Baltimore City Public Schools system in 1829. Also a public high school had also been established in 1883 \\"The Colored High School\\", which later became Frederick Douglass High School which at some point in its history became open to both African-American boys and girls. In addition, with also co-educational Forest Park High School later built in the early 1920s in the northwest area of the City as the first \\"co-ed\\" Baltimore public high school, these types of neighborhood/district \\"comprehensive\\" public high schools soon spread through all quadrants of the City, eventually numbering about 20 co-ed neighborhood high schools in the Baltimore City Public Schools by the early 1970s. In the surrounding rural now suburban Baltimore County to the west, north and east of the city and Anne Arundel County to the city's south, the first public high school established in the late 19th century were open to both boys and girls and eventually grew to a similar number of about 25 secondary schools in neighborhoods each in both counties to the present. An addition/annex building to the east of the original 1910 S.H.S. structure, also facing Warren Avenue at the intersection with Riverside Avenue was constructed in 1926 of matching red brick with limestone trim and a more modernist style gym-swimming pool brick building to the south in 1956. The new type of co-educational neighborhood public high school had a challenging new role in the Baltimore City Public Schools system. Now raised to the level of a full high school / secondary school from its previous lower \\"junior high\\" status, the building was assigned the BCPS number of #70 in the 1920s. The Southern High School, originally located on the southeast corner of Warren Avenue and William Street, three blocks to the east from the main commercial district of the old South Baltimore commercial district neighborhood between Light Street and South Charles Street, with the adjacent municipal markethouse (one of originally eleven at their height, later seven of the city Public Market House system) of the Cross Street Market, established in the 1840s. The Southern High building was constructed of red brick with limestone trim in a Jacobean/English Tudor style architecture used for a number of Baltimore City and other American schools of that era. Located on a site adjacent to the sidewalks with rows of traditional Baltimore rowhouses with famous white marble steps and front facade bases were on the east, west and south sides of the school in the Federal Hill/South Baltimore neighborhood, but fronting towards the southern side of Federal Hill Park which overlooks the downtown skyline of the city's central business district and the former \\"Basin\\", now the famed \\"Inner Harbor\\". The Southern High building complex at its most extensive period contained an auditorium, three gymnasiums, a 500-person capacity cafeteria, library, six shops, six home education rooms, one laboratory, and 44 classrooms.City of Baltimore Department of Education Bureau of research, School Plant Directory, by John L. Stenquist. City of Baltimore Department of Education Bureau of research, September 1, 1952. By 1955, the school had an enrollment of 1,800 students, necessitating further enlargement of the facilities. Then Mayor Thomas J. D'Alesandro, Jr., broke ground on an expansion project designed to accommodate 600 additional students. This $2 million (1956 money) addition and expansion was completed in the summer of 1956, which added eight more regular classrooms, a double classroom, five new art rooms, eight commercial classrooms for typing and business machines, three music rooms, a three shops for machine, print and auto mechanic instruction, allowing the school to thrive while the city continued to grow.\\"$2-Million School Dream Nears Reality\\", The Baltimore Sun, July 6, 1956. Construction of replacement building, 1976-1978 By 1976, when the school had again outgrown its capacity, but also with declining physical conditions because of decades of suffering heavy hard usage with typical big city annual budget problems of poor and often deferred maintenance, Baltimore City Public School officials deemed it necessary to erect a new structure. The \\"new\\" Southern High School, was only two blocks to the southeast in the 1100 block of Covington Street, overlooking to the north and east of the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River, east of the Inner Harbor towards the lower Baltimore Harbor which was still active and busy with freight, cargo and shipping facilities. The new S.H.S. looked down a two block slope towards the Francis Scott Key Highway of 1913 (\\"Key Highway\\") and the shipyards from the Bethlehem Steel Corporation from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania bordering it on the north side waterfront facing the Patapsco River's Northwest Branch. Upon its completion in late 1978, the new modernist simple stark block building of light tan/brown brick was capable of accommodating 2,400 students. The State of Maryland's School Construction Program provided $11.7 million for the project of the estimated total cost of $17 million.Peter Buehl, \\"Firm of 'advocates' cuts school cost\\", The Baltimore Sun, Dec 12, 1976.\\"Southern students, merchants to reschedule summit\\", Baltimore News American, November 27, 1978.

College career At Northwest Mississippi Community College in Senatobia, Mississippi, Buckley accounted for 1,300 yards and 12 touchdowns on 160 carries for the Rangers in 2004. 140 yards per game on the ground for the Rangers and earned Junior College All-America honors as well as Most Valuable Player of the Mississippi Junior College North Division Ranked No. 23 among junior college players. Buckley finished at Northwest with 160 rushes for 1,300 yards and 12 touchdowns in 2004. Despite only playing two years for Chattanooga, Buckley is fourth on the Mocs‚Äô all-time rushing list. He totaled 2,437 yards in two seasons and holds the No. 1 and No. 2 marks on UTC‚Äôs single season rushing list. The 1,204 yards he amassed in his senior year is second only to the 1,233 yards he piled up in his junior campaign. He became the leader of the offense and was the 2006 recipient of the Woodrow Wolford Sr. Football Scholarship. Professional career =Pre-draft measurables= =San Diego Chargers= Buckley was not drafted in the 2007 NFL Draft, but was signed by the San Diego Chargers as a free agent. He was on the team's practice squad during the 2007 season and 2008 season. He was waived on February 26, 2009. =Philadelphia Eagles= Buckley was claimed off waivers by the Philadelphia Eagles on March 9, 2009. Due to his performance in the preseason, the Eagles chose to keep him on the roster, cutting Lorenzo Booker instead. Buckley was given an exclusive-rights free agent tender and was re- signed to a one-year contract on July 30, 2011. He was released during final roster cuts on September 3. =Detroit Lions= The Detroit Lions signed Buckley following the placement of Jerome Harrison on the reserve/non-football injury list on October 21, 2011.

About 1580 Wittich stayed with Tycho Brahe on his island Hven in √ñresund, where he worked at his Uraniborg. He then was employed by William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel. Wittich died in Vienna. Work Wittich may have been influenced by Valentin Naboth's book Primarum de coelo et terra in adopting the Capellan system to explain the motion of the inferior planets. It is evident from Wittich's diagram of his Capellan system that the Martian orbit does not intersect the solar orbit nor those of Mercury and Venus,see p139 of The Wittich Connection by Gingerich & Westman, or p30 of Jarrell's The contemporaries of Tycho Brahe in Taton & Wilson 1989 and would thus be compatible with solid celestial orbs, with the Solar orb containing the orbs of Venus and of Mercury and itself in turn wholly circumscribed by a Martian orb. This was in significant contrast with Ursus's geoheliocentric model in which the orbits of Mercury and Venus intersect the Martian orbit but the Solar orbit does not,p34 Taton & Wilson 1989 and also with the Tychonic model in which the Martian orbit also intersects the Solar orbit in addition to those of Mercury and Venus, and whereby both these models rule out solid celestial orbs that cannot interpenetrate, if not excluding interpenetrating fluid orbs. However, Wittich's Capellan model of the Martian orbit contradicted Copernicus's model in which Mars at opposition is nearer to the Earth than the Sun is, whereby if true the Solar and Martian orbits must intersect in all geoheliocentric models. Thus the question of whether the daily parallax of Mars was ever greater than that of the Sun was crucial to whether Wittich's (and indeed also Praetorius's and Ursus's) model was observationally tenable or not. It seems Tycho Brahe eventually came to the conclusion by 1588 that Mars does come nearer to the Earth than the Sun is, albeit contradicting his earlier conclusion by 1584 that his observations of Mars at opposition in 1582-3 established it had no discernible parallax, whereas he put the Sun's parallax at 3 arcminutes. Thus Brahe's 1588 model crucially contradicted both Wittich's and also Ursus's geoheliocentric models at least in respect of the dimensions of the Martian orbit, by positing its intersection with the Solar orbit. Having failed to find any Martian parallax greater than the Solar parallax, Tycho had no valid observational evidence for his 1588 conclusion that Mars comes nearer to the Earth than the Sun,See p71 Gingerich & Westman 1988 and nor did anybody else at that time,In fact given the modern values of some 9\\" for solar parallax and a maximum of some 23\\" for Martian parallax, they were indetectable by naked eye or even by telescopic instrumentation at the time. whereby Tycho's uniquely distinctive geoheliocentric model had no valid observational support in this respect. It seems its credibility rested solely upon his aristocratic social status rather than any scientific evidence. And this failure to find any Martian parallax in effect also refuted Copernicus's heliocentric model in respect of its Martian orbit, and supported the geocentric models of Ptolemy and the Capellan geoheliocentric model of Wittich and Praetorius and also Ursus's more Tychonic model. The latter differed from Tycho's only in respect of its non- intersecting Martian and Solar orbits and its daily rotating Earth. It seems a primary purpose of Wittich's Capellan model, evident from the drafting markings in his drawing, was to save the integrity of solid celestial orbs, and the only planetary models compatible with solid celestial orbs were the Ptolemaic, Copernican and Wittichan Capellan (including Praetorius's) planetary models. But in 1610 Galileo's novel telescopic confirmation that Venus has a full set of phases like the Moon, published in his 1613 Letters on Sunspots, refuted the Ptolemaic geocentric model, which implied they are only crescents in conjunction, just as in opposition, whereas they are gibbous or full in conjunction. This crucial novel fact was logically implied by the Heraclidean, Capellan and Tychonic geoheliocentric planetary models, according to all of which at least the orbits of Venus and Mercury are centred on the Sun rather than the Earth, as well as by the pure heliocentric model. Consequently this left only the Copernican and Wittichan Capellan models compatible with both solid orbs and the phases of Venus. But only the Wittichan system was also compatible with the failure to find any stellar parallax predicted by all heliocentric models, in addition to also being compatible with the failure to find any Martian parallax that refuted both the Copernican and Tychonic models. Ursus's 1588 geoheliocentric planetary model Thus by 1610 it seems the only observationally tenable candidate for a planetary model with solid celestial orbs was Wittich's Capellan system. Indeed it also seems it was even the only planetary model that was generally observationally tenable, given the twin failures to find any stellar annual parallax nor any Martian daily parallax at that time.However, van Helden's 1989 The telescope and cosmic dimensions reports: \\"In his Astronomia nova Kepler argued that [Tycho Brahe's measurements of the diurnal parallax of Mars] showed that Mars's parallax was never greater than 4', which put a limit of 2' on the Sun's parallax...\\". See p109 Taton & Wilson 1989. But inasmuch as this seems to assert Kepler found Brahe's observations showed Mars's parallax to be as great as 4', it is contrary to the impression given by Gingerich & Westman 1988 and also by Dreyer's 1890 and Gingerich's 1982 that Kepler found no justification in Brahe's observations for any discernible Martian parallax. However, insofar as it was accepted that comets are superlunary and sphere- busting, whereby solid celestial orbs are impossible and thus intersecting orbits cease to be impossible, then this thereby also admitted the model of Ursus (and Origanus) as also observationally tenable, along with Wittich's Capellan system (and thus also Praetorius's), whilst the Ptolemaic model was ruled out by the phases of Venus, all heliocentric models by the perceived absence of any annual stellar parallax, and both the Copernican and Tychonic models were also refuted by the absence of any Martian daily parallax.Longomontanus's semi-Tychonic model would also have been ruled out if it put Mars closer to the Earth than the Sun at any point. Renowned anti- Copernican adherents of the Capellan planetary model included Francis Bacon, inter alia, and this model appealed to those who accepted Ptolemy's purely geocentric model was refuted by the phases of Venus, but were unpersuaded by Tychonic arguments that Mars, Jupiter and Saturn also orbited the Sun in addition to Mercury and Venus.p38 The Tychonic and semi-Tychonic world systems Christine Schofield in Taton & Wilson 1989 Indeed even Newton's arguments for this stated in his commentary on Phenomenon 3 of Book 3 of his Principia were notably invalid.Newton's crucial Phenomena 3, 4 and 5 were notably studiously neutral between the heliocentric and Tychonic planetary models in only admitting 5 primary planets orbited the Sun, thus not including the Earth, and remained so even in its 1726 third edition.

Sea breezes and easterly winds then bring the haar into the east coast of Scotland and North-East England where it can continue for several miles inland. This can be common in the UK summer when heating of the land creates a sea breeze, bringing haar in from the sea and as a result can significantly reduce temperatures compared to those just a few miles inland.

In its tenth year under head coach Fritz Crisler, Michigan compiled a perfect 10-0 record, won the Big Ten Conference championship, and defeated the USC Trojans by a score of 49-0 in the 1948 Rose Bowl game. Although ranked second in the AP Poll at the end of the regular season, the Wolverines were selected as the nation's No. 1 team by a 226-119 margin over Notre Dame in an unprecedented AP Poll taken after the bowl games. The 1947 team outscored its opponents, 394-53, and has been selected as the best team in the history of Michigan football. The 1947 Michigan Wolverines included five players who have been inducted into the College or Pro Football Halls of Fame: left halfback Bob Chappuis (who finished second in the 1947 Heisman Trophy voting), right halfback Bump Elliott (who received the Chicago Tribune trophy as the Big Ten MVP), defensive quarterback Pete Elliott, defensive end Len Ford, and tackle Al Wistert. Offensive tackle Bruce Hilkene was the team captain, and quarterback Howard Yerges was the field general who became known as \\"Crisler's 'second brain.'\\" Jack Weisenburger was the \\"spinning fullback\\" and the 1947 Big Ten rushing leader. The 1947 Wolverines were the first team fully to embrace the concept of defensive and offensive specialization. Previously, most players had played their positions on both offense and defense. In 1947, Fritz Crisler established separate offensive and defensive squads. Only Bump Elliott and Jack Weisenberger played on both squads. In November 1947, Time magazine ran a feature article about the 1947 Wolverines focusing on the new era of specialization marked by Crisler's decision to field separate offensive and defensive units. The Time article noted: \\"Michigan's sleight-of-hand repertory is a baffling assortment of double reverses, buck-reverse laterals, crisscrosses, quick-hits and spins from seven different formations. Sometimes, watching from the side lines, even Coach Crisler isn't sure which Michigan man has the ball. Michigan plays one team on offense, one on defense...Whenever Michigan's defensive team regains the ball, Crisler orders: 'Offense unit, up and out,' and nine men pour onto the field at once.\\" Crisler's single-wing formation in action was \\"so dazzling in its deception\\" that the media nicknamed the 1947 team the \\"Mad Magicians\\". Schedule Season summary =Pre-season= 1947 Michigan team engaged in calisthenics The 1946 Michigan football team compiled a record of 6‚Äì2‚Äì1 and closed the season with four consecutive wins over ranked opponents by a combined score of 162 to 19. In December 1946, lineman Bruce Hilkene was selected as the captain of the 1947 team. Hilkene had previously been selected as the captain of the 1945 team, but he was transferred as a Navy trainee and did not play for Michigan in 1945. Coming off a strong finish, the 1947 team featured a number of veterans from the 1946 squad. The returning veterans included halfback Bob Chappuis who set a Big Ten Conference record for total offense in 1946 and finished second in the voting for the Chicago Tribune Trophy as the Most Valuable Player in the Big Ten. Other returning starters included quarterback Howard Yerges, halfbacks Bump Elliott and Gene Derricotte, fullback Jack Weisenburger, ends Len Ford and Bob Mann, and linemen Hilkene, Bill Pritula, Quentin Sickels, Dominic Tomasi, and J. T. White. With a solid veteran core, the 1947 Wolverines were expected to be one of the best teams in the country. =Week 1: Michigan State= Scoreboard at Michigan Stadium reflects a 55-0 victory over Michigan State. On September 27, 1947, Michigan opened the season with a non-conference game against Michigan State College. Playing in Ann Arbor in front of 73,115 spectators, the Wolverines defeated the Spartans, 55‚Äì0. The game was the first as head coach of the Spartans for \\"Biggie\\" Munn, who had been an assistant coach at Michigan from 1938 to 1945. Michigan dominated the game, outgaining Michigan State 504 yards to 56. Michigan head coach Fritz Crisler played second, third, and fourth string players later in the game, using 37 players in all. Bob Chappuis ran for three touchdowns and threw a touchdown pass for another. Jim Brieske made seven of eight point after touchdown (PAT) attempts in the game. Michigan scored twice in the first quarter on touchdown runs by Jack Weisenburger and Chappuis. The second touchdown was set up by a 53-yard run by Bump Elliott. The Wolverines added two more touchdowns in the second quarter on short runs by Chappuis and Bump Elliott. Three more touchdowns followed in the third quarter, including a long touchdown pass from Chappuis to Len Ford with Ford running the last 35 yards after the catch. Center Dan Dworsky also scored on a 36-yard fumble return.1948 Michiganensian, Michigan State game summary, p. 92. Michigan's starting lineup against Michigan State was Ford (left end), Hilkene (left tackle), Soboleski (right guard), Dworsky (center), Wilkins (right guard), Pritula (right tackle), McNeill (right end), Weisenburger (quarterback), Derricotte (left halfback), Bump Elliott (right halfback), and Kempthorn (fullback). =Week 2: Stanford= Weisenberger blocks for Chappuis against Stanford In the second week of the season, Michigan hosted Stanford. The game was the first between the two schools since the 1902 Rose Bowl which Michigan won by a 49-0 margin. In the 1947 rematch, Michigan scored 28 points in the first quarter and won the game 49-13. Michigan's starting lineup against Stanford was Mann (left end), Hilkene (left tackle), Soboleski (right guard), White (center), Wilkins (right guard), Pritula (right tackle), Rifenburg (right end), Yerges (quarterback), Chappuis (left halfback), Bump Elliott (right halfback), and Weisenburger (fullback). =Week 3: Pittsburgh= In the third week of the season, Michigan hosted Pittsburgh. Michigan dominated the game, winning by a 69-0 score and outgaining the Panthers 496 yards to 69. One week earlier, Notre Dame had beaten Pitt by a score of 40-6. Pitt converted only one first down in the entire game. After the first quarter in Ann Arbor, the score was 0-0. Michigan's offense began to click in the second quarter with three touchdowns, followed by three more in the third quarter and four in the fourth quarter. The game's highlights included a 70-yard touchdown pass from Bob Chappuis to Bob Mann, a 40-yard interception return by Bump Elliott, an 80-yard punt return by Gene Derricotte. Michigan's ten touchdowns were scored by Mann (2), Derricotte, Jack Weisenburger, Bump Elliott, Don Kuick, Tom Peterson, and Len Ford. Jim Brieske converted 9 of 10 PAT attempts. In The New York Times, Walter W. Ruch wrote: \\"Angered by the fact that it had not been able to score in the first quarter, it 'poured it on.'\\" Michigan's starting lineup against Pitt was Ford (left end), Wistert (left tackle), Soboleski (right guard), Dworsky (center), Sickels (right guard), Dendrinos (right tackle), McNeill (right end), Pete Elliott (quarterback), Derricotte (left halfback), Bump Elliott (right halfback), and Kempthorn (fullback). =Week 4: at Northwestern= Bump Elliott \\"bums a ride\\" from Northwestern's Jules Slegel On October 18, 1948, Michigan played its first road game against Northwestern at Dyche Stadium in Evanston, Illinois. Michigan jumped out to a 49-7 lead after three quarters. Playing against Michigan's third team, the Wildcats scored 14 points in the fourth quarter for a final score of 49-21. Highlights of the game included a 59-yard punt return by Gene Derricotte and a 52-yard touchdown run on an end around by Bob Mann. Michigan's seven touchdowns were scored by Jack Weisenburger (2), Bob Chappuis, Bump Elliott, Henry Fonde, Tom Peterson, and Mann. Jim Brieske converted all seven PATs for Michigan. After four games, Michigan had scored 222 points in 240 minutes, prompting comparisons to Michigan's \\"Point-a-Minute\\" teams of the early 1900s. Michigan's starting lineup against Northwestern was Ford (left end), Wistert (left tackle), Soboleski (right guard), Dworsky (center), Sickels (right guard), Kohl (right tackle), McNeill (right end), Pete Elliott (quarterback), Derricotte (left halfback), Fonde (right halfback), and Peterson (fullback). =Week 5: Minnesota= In the fifth week of the season, Michigan played its homecoming game against Minnesota. Michigan won a close game by a score of 13-6. Michigan scored first on a long touchdown pass from Bob Chappuis to Bump Elliott. The final touchdown in the fourth quarter followed a 24-yard interception return by Jack Weisenburger to the Minnesota 21-yard line. Gene Derricotte scored after faking to the right and then running through a hole on the left side and into the endzone. Chappuis was held to 26 rushing yards, less than two yards per carry. While Michigan won a close game over Minnesota, No. 2 Notre Dame defeated Iowa in South Bend, 21-0. In the AP Poll released after these games, Notre Dame passed Michigan to take the No. 1 ranking. Michigan's starting lineup against Minnesota was Mann (left end), Hilkene (left tackle), Tomasi (right guard), White (center), Wilkins (right guard), Pritula (right tackle), Rifenburg (right end), Yerges (quarterback), Chappuis (left halfback), Bump Elliott (right halfback), and Weisenburger (fullback). =Week 6: at Illinois= Bump Elliott runs 74 yards for a touchdown against Illinois. In the sixth week of the season, Michigan traveled to Champaign, Illinois for Illinois' homecoming game. For the second straight week, Michigan won by a narrow margin 14-7. Late in the first quarter, Michigan took a 7-0 lead on a 74-yard punt return by Bump Elliott and a PAT by Jim Brieske. Illinois tied the game in the second quarter on a run by Russ Steger. Michigan's winning touchdown was set up by a 52-yard passing play from Bob Chappuis to Bump Elliott. Elliott was tackled the four-yard line, and Fonde ran for the touchdown. Brieske again converted the PAT. Neither team scored in the second half. Michigan's starting lineup against Minnesota was Mann (left end), Hilkene (left tackle), Tomasi (right guard), White (center), Wilkins (right guard), Pritula (right tackle), Rifenburg (right end), Yerges (quarterback), Chappuis (left halfback), Bump Elliott (right halfback), and Weisenburger (fullback). =Week 7: Indiana= In the sixth week of the season, Michigan regained its momentum and defeated Indiana 35-0 in Ann Arbor. In a game played amid intermittent snow flurries, highlights included a 61-yard run by Weisenburger in the second quarter and a 50-yard pass from Bob Chappuis to Dick Rifenburg in the fourth quarter. Michigan's five touchdowns were scored by Bump Elliott (2), Howard Yerges, Dick Rifenburg, and Henry Fonde. Notre Dame defeated Army, 27-7, and retained the No. 1 ranking in the AP Poll. Michigan's starting lineup against Minnesota was Mann (left end), Hilkene (left tackle), Tomasi (right guard), White (center), Wilkins (right guard), Pritula (right tackle), Rifenburg (right end), Yerges (quarterback), Chappuis (left halfback), Bump Elliott (right halfback), and Weisenburger (fullback). =Week 8: at Wisconsin= Elliott brothers, Crisler and Hilkene celebrate Big Nine championship in Wisconsin. In the eighth week, Michigan traveled to Camp Randall Stadium in Madison, Wisconsin to play Wisconsin. Michigan won the game, 40-6, to clinch the Big Nine championship irrespective of the outcome of the following week's game against Ohio State. The game was played in cold, cloudy conditions amid rain and snow. Wisconsin came into the game on a four-game winning streak and \\"had been given a good chance to win.\\" The New York Times wrote that Michigan's \\"overwhelming superiority\\" was too much for the Badgers as Bob Chappuis \\"threw passes long and short and sliced through the Wisconsin line with increasing effectiveness.\\" Chappuis threw three touchdown passes, and Gene Derricotte returned a punt 77 yards for a touchdown. Michigan's six touchdowns were scored by Howard Yerges (2), Derricotte, Weisenburger, Rifenburg, and Tom Peterson. While Michigan defeated Wisconsin by 34 points, Notre Dame won a narrow victory against Northwestern, 26-19. After these games, Allison Danzig wrote: > \\"While Notre Dame was yielding as many touchdowns to Northwestern's > intercepting Couriers as its six previous opponents combined had scored, the > Maize and Blue was furnishing one of the season's finest offensive displays > in rain, snow and mud.

Michigan's starting lineup against Minnesota was Mann (left end), Hilkene (left tackle), Tomasi (right guard), White (center), Wilkins (right guard), Pritula (right tackle), Rifenburg (right end), Yerges (quarterback), Chappuis (left halfback), Bump Elliott (right halfback), and Kempthorn (fullback). =Week 9: Ohio State= On November 22, 1947, Michigan concluded the regular season with a 21-0 win at home against rival Ohio State. Bump Elliott, Bob Chappuis, and Jack Weisenburger each ran for touchdowns, and Jim Brieske converted all three PATs. Late in the game, the fans at Michigan Stadium began chanting, \\"California, Here I Come.\\" At the end of the game, Fritz Crisler was \\"streaming tears of joy as he walked off the field.\\" Michigan's starting lineup against Ohio State was Mann (left end), Hilkene (left tackle), Tomasi (right guard), White (center), Wilkins (right guard), Pritula (right tackle), Rifenburg (right end), Yerges (quarterback), Chappuis (left halfback), Bump Elliott (right halfback), and Weisenburger (fullback). =Final AP Poll= Despite the Wolverines' win over Ohio State, Notre Dame, after defeating Tulane 59-6, overtook Michigan in the AP Poll released on November 24, 1947. In a close vote, Notre Dame scored 1,798 points, and Michigan scored 1,768 points. Notre Dame's margin was reduced to eight points (1,184 points for Notre Dame, 1,176 points for Michigan) in the AP Poll released on December 2, 1947. On December 6, Notre Dame beat No. 3 USC, 38-7. In the final AP Poll released two days later, Notre Dame received 107 of 146 first place votes and edged Michigan by 1,410 points to 1,289. Although Michigan would defeat USC three weeks later by an even larger margin that Notre Dame, the final AP Poll in the late 1940s was taken at the end of the regular season and before any bowl games were played. At the time, Notre Dame did not participate in Bowl games. Accordingly, on December 10, 1947, the Dr. Henry L. Williams Trophy was presented to Notre Dame for finishing No. 1 in the final polling. =Rose Bowl: USC= As the Big Nine Conference champions, Michigan played in the 1948 Rose Bowl against the University of Southern California. The game was Michigan's first appearance in a bowl game since its 49-0 victory over Stanford in the 1902 Rose Bowl. The 1947 team duplicated that score, defeating USC 49-0 in the 1948 Rose Bowl. The 49-point margin was the worst defeat in the history of the USC football program, and Michigan's 491 yards of total offense set a Rose Bowl record. The Wolverines threw four touchdown passes, and Jack Weisenburger ran for three touchdowns. Michigan completed 17 of 27 passes for 272 passing yards in the game. On its second drive of the game, Michigan drove 63 yards for the game's first touchdown. The drive featured a 21-yard pass from Chappuis to Bump Elliott and a 17-yard gain to the nine-yard line on a pass from Chappuis to Dick Rifenburg. Weisenburger ran for the touchdown from the one-yard line, and Jim Brieske kicked the PAT. In the second quarter, Michigan increased its lead on a drive featuring a 23-yard gain to the 10-yard line on a pass from Chappuis to Gene Derricotte. Weisenburger again ran it in from the one-yard line with Brieske again kicking the PAT. Late in the second quarter, a 52-yard punt by Weisenburger pinned the Trojans inside their one-yard line. USC punted, giving Michigan good field position. They scored on a drive that featured a 27-yard gain on a pass from Chappuis to Bump Elliott and a 16-yard run by Chappuis, and concluded with an 11-yard jump pass from Chappuis to Elliott. Brieske converted his third PAT, and Michigan led 21-0 at halftime. In the third quarter, Michigan added to its lead on 18-yard touchdown pass in which Chappuis rolled out to his right and threw across the field to quarterback Howard Yerges, who was open at the nine- yard line. Yerges caught the ball and ran it in for a touchdown, giving Michigan a 28-0 lead. The Wolverines closed the game with three touchdowns in the fourth quarter. The touchdowns came on a one-yard run by Weisenberger, a 46-yard pass from Henry Fonde to Derricotte who was open at the 25-yard line and ran untouched down the right sideline, and a 29-yard pass from Yerges to Rifenburg. Brieske converted all seven PATs for Michigan. Michigan's starting lineup in the Rose Bowl was Mann (left end), Hilkene (left tackle), Tomasi (right guard), White (center), Wilkins (right guard), Pritula (right tackle), Rifenburg (right end), Yerges (quarterback), Chappuis (left halfback), Bump Elliott (right halfback), and Weisenburger (fullback). National championship controversy =Response to Michigan's Rose Bowl win= After the final AP Poll, Michigan went on to beat USC in the 1948 Rose Bowl, a greater margin that by which Notre Dame had beaten USC (38-7). Michigan's 49-0 victory was the largest margin of victory ever against a USC team and the most points scored in Rose Bowl history. Football writer Pete Rozelle reported on the reaction of the assembled writers in the Rose Bowl press box. \\"From Grantland Rice down through the ranks of the nation's top sports writers assembled in the Rose Bowl press box yesterday there was nothing but glowing expletives for the synchronized Michigan Wolverine wrecking crew that powered over Southern California, 49-0. While for the most part hedging from a comparison of Michigan with Notre Dame, the consensus of the scribes was that the offensive- minded Ann Arbor squad deserved no less than a co-rating with the Irish as America's Number One Collegiate eleven.\\" Grantland Rice, the dean of the nation's sports writers, wrote of Michigan: \\"It is the best all-around college football team I've seen this year. The backfield's brilliant passing and running skill gives Michigan the most powerful offense in the country.\\" Red Smith of the New York Herald Tribune said, \\"No other team that I have seen this season did things with so little effort. Crisler has so many that do so much.\\" =Debate over which team was best= Notre Dame supporters argued that the post-season AP poll was final and should not be revisited. They contended that Michigan had run up the score on USC, noted that Notre Dame had not had an opportunity to play in a bowl game, and asserted that Michigan and other Big Nine schools were unwilling to schedule Notre Dame in the regular season. Detroit Free Press sports editor, Lyall Smith, argued the debate should be answered by comparing the two team's performance against common opponents. Smith noted: \\"They played three common foes. Notre Dame beat Pitt, 40-6, a margin of 34 points: Michigan beat Pitt 59-0\\\\. Notre Dame defeated Northwestern, 26 to 19, a margin of seven points: Michigan beat the 'Cats 49 to 21, for a 28-point advantage. Notre Dame dropped USC, 36 to 7, in what Coach Frank Leahy termed his team's 'greatest game of the year,' while Michigan slaughtered the same Trojans, 49 to 0. Against those three common opponents the Irish scored 104 points to 32. Michigan's margin was 167 to 21.\\" Smith also pointed to Michigan's strength of schedule: \\"The teams Michigan played won 42 games, lost 48 and tied five. Notre Dame's adversaries won only 30, lost 45, and tied 6.\\" =Special post-bowl AP poll= In response to the debate over which team deserved to be recognized as the nation's best, the Associated Press decided to hold a post-bowl poll. The AP reported on the rationale for the special poll this way: \\"The Associated Press is polling sports editors of its member papers throughout the country to help settle the argument as to which is the better football team - Michigan or Notre Dame. The AP's final poll of the top ten teams, released December 8 at the conclusion of the regulation season, resulted in Notre Dame winning first place with 1,410 points. Michigan was second with 1,289... Returns so far received indicate that voting in this latest poll is likely to be the heaviest ever recorded.\\" Another AP report indicated the special poll was \\"conducted by popular demand\\" to answer \\"the burning sports question of the day\\" and to do so \\"at the ballot box.\\" Michigan was voted No. 1 in the post-bowl poll by a vote of 226 to 119. The AP reported: \\"The nation's sports writers gave the final answer Tuesday to the raging controversy on the relative strength of the Notre Dame and Michigan football teams, and it was the Wolverines over the Irish by almost two to one‚Äîincluding those who saw both powerhouses perform... In the over-all total, 226 writers in 48 states and the District of Columbia picked Michigan, 119 balloted for Notre Dame, and 12 called it a draw. Opinion of the 54 writers who saw both in action last fall coincided at almost the same ratio, with 33 giving the nod to Michigan, 17 to Notre Dame, and four voting for a tie.\\" The 357 votes cast in the post-bowl poll represented \\"the largest ever to take part in such an AP voting.\\" Commenting on the special poll, Michigan coach Fritz Crisler said \\"the men who voted couldn't have made a mistake if they had picked either team.\\" He described Notre Dame coach Frank Leahy as a \\"superb coach.\\" Notre Dame President, Father John Cavanagh said, \\"We at Notre Dame feel grateful for the magnanimous statement of Coach Crisler. I listened to Michigan against Southern California and have only praise for the skill and accomplishment of your fine team.\\" Despite the magnanimous statements of Coach Crisler and Father Cavanagh, the reversed decision in the post-bowl poll only stoked the debate over which team was best. Said one columnist: \\"Hottest argument of the moment is the one over which had the better football team, Michigan or Notre Dame.\\" Forty years later, the debate was still ongoing. In 1988, Michigan center Dan Dworsky noted: \\"Notre Dame still claims that national championship and so do we.\\" Players =Varsity letter winners= On January 5, 1948, head coach Fritz Crisler announced that he had awarded varsity letters to 35 members of the 1947 football team.

Lacy is in three of his most celebrated roles. From left to right: the lead from Sauny the Scot: or The Taming of The Shrew (Lacy's own adaptation from Shakespeare performed at the Theatre Royal in 1667); Monsieur Device from The Country Chaplain (by the Duke of Newcastle); and Parson Scruple from The Cheats (by John Wilson). John Lacy (c. 1615? - 17 September 1681) was an English comic actor and playwright during the Restoration era. In his own time he gained a reputation as \\"the greatest comedian of his day\\"Fox, p. 105. and was the favourite comic of King Charles II. Life Lacy was born in or near Doncaster; in 1631 he became an apprentice of John Ogilby, when Ogilby was functioning as what was then called a \\"dancing master\\"--roughly the equivalent of a modern dance teacher and choreographer. Lacy's stage career began by 1639, when he was a member of Beeston's Boys. Lacy joined the royalist forces in the English Civil War, and was commissioned an officer (lieutenant and quartermaster). After the English Interregnum period, once Charles II returned to the throne and the London theatres re-opened, Lacy became an actor with the newly formed King's Company.See Maidment and Logan's edition of Lacy's Works, Prefatory Memoir, p. xi. Lacy quickly evolved into a popular comedian; Samuel Pepys admired and enjoyed his work, as he recorded in his Diary. On 21 May 1662, Pepys saw Lacy in as the title character in a play called The French Dancing-Mistress; on the next day he saw Lacy as Johnny Thump in James Shirley's Love in a Maze. On 12 June 1663 Pepys saw Lacy in Sir Robert Howard's The Committee, and praised Lacy's acting in the role of the Irish footman Teague as \\"beyond imagination;\\" on 13 August 1667, Pepys saw the same play, and called Lacy's part \\"so well performed that it would set off anything.\\" Pepys saw Lacy in his own Sauny the Scot on 9 April 1667.Maidment and Logan, pp. xi-xii. Lacy was also known for the role of Galliard in the Duke of Newcastle's play The Variety, and Scruple in John Wilson's The Cheats. He played roles in Ben Jonson's comedies: Ananias in The Alchemist, Captain Otter in Epicene, and Sir Politic Would-Be in Volpone. According to Sir George Etheredge, Lacy was the lover of Nell Gwyn along with the King's Company star Charles Hart.Maidment and Logan, p. xvii. After a serious illness in 1668, Lacy recovered and returned to the stage, though he performed less often than before. Plays Lacy is credited with the authorship of four plays: * Sauny the Scot (acted 1667; printed 1698) * The Dumb Lady, or The Farrier Made Physician (printed 1672) * The Old Troop, or Monsier Ragou (printed 1672) * Sir Hercules Buffoon, or The Poetical Squire (printed 1684). Lacy was more of an adapter than an original artist, however (a not-unusual trait among Restoration dramatists). Sauny the Scot is a prose version of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew. In Lacy's version, Grumio becomes Sauny, a clown who dominates the play, and a role played by Lacy himself.Halliday, pp. 270, 484. Sir Hercules Buffoon draws upon Philip Massinger's The City Madam and A New Way to Pay Old Debts. The Dumb Lady derives from Moli√®re's Le M√©decin malgr√© lui. Trouble His popularity with Charles II did not prevent Lacy from getting into significant trouble at one point in his career. On 15 April 1667 Pepys saw Lacy play in The Change of Crowns, by Edward Howard. The King and Queen were in the audience, along with the Duke of York and his Duchess, and \\"all the Court\\". During the performance, Lacy improvised some lines about corruption at Court and the selling of offices. The King was so angry that he had the company banned from performing; and Lacy was incarcerated. Lacy was released on 20 April and had a confrontation with \\"Ned\\" Howard; Lacy unreasonably blamed Howard for the trouble he had got himself into with the King. The two theatre men came to blows: Howard hit Lacy in his face with a glove, and Lacy responded by striking Howard over the head with his cane.Maidment and Logan, pp. xii-xiii. The actors prevailed upon the King to allow them to return to the stage, and Lacy was soon forgiven. Notes References *Fox, Adam. Oral and Literate Culture in England, 1500-1700\\\\.

J. Thomson at the University of London and alongside Nobel laureate Charles Glover Barkla at the University of Edinburgh. A supporter of the Parson magneton, Allen was also an early contributor to the field of quantum mechanics. Biography Allen was born in Bodmin in Cornwall, the son of Rev Richard Allen, a Wesleyan Methodist Minister. He attended John Wesley's School in Bath, Somerset.http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf As an undergraduate at Trinity College, Cambridge, Allen shared Whewell's Court with fellow pupil Edmund Whittaker, earning his Mathematics B.A. there in 1896. After working at Cavendish Laboratory, Allen returned to Cambridge in 1898 to conduct research under J. J. Thomson on the motion of spheres through viscous fluids, useful in the determination of the elementary unit of charge. In 1900 he moved to Renfrew, where he researched spectral photography, the Zeeman effect, and radioactivity under Lord Blythwood. He was appointed lecturer in 1905 at King's College London where he obtained a D.Sc. in 1909 for his work on the discharge of electricity through gases.H. Stanley Allen, \\"Some Problems Connected with the Discharge of Electricity in Gases\\", King's College London (1909). He conducted this work under Harold A. Wilson and contemporary Charles Glover Barkla, whom he followed to the University of Edinburgh in 1919. Allen's 1913 book, \\"Photo-electricity\\",H. Stanley Allen, Photo-electricity: the Liberation of Electrons by Light (London: Longmans Green 1913). was an early contribution to the study of radiation, focusing on his earlier work in photoelectric fatigue. He then wrote a series of papers concerned with structure of the atom based on its magnetic and spectral properties. Beginning in 1919, he contributed a series of articles favoring a modified version of the Parson magneton, a physical model for the electron originally proposed in 1915. Quantum theory was then in its infancy and Allen's contributions were among the earliest to the subject..H. Stanley Allen, The Quantum and its Interpretation, (London: Methuen & Co. 1928).H. Stanley Allen, Electrons and Waves: An Introduction to Atomic Physics (London: Macmillan 1932).

He has composed more than 200 settings for the liturgy, as well as scored numerous television programs, made-for-TV movies, and documentary films. His tunes are sung in many Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist congregations. He is considered one of the most popular contemporary Jewish liturgical composers in the United States. Early life Finkelstein was born in Israel in 1951. His father, the late Zvi Finkelstein, accepted a cantorial position in London, England, and the family moved there in 1955. Young Meir displayed outstanding musical talent at an early age. Together with his older brother, Aryeh, he was soon accompanying their father in concert and on radio and television. At age 14, Meir became the cantor for a small synagogue in Glasgow, Scotland, thereby becoming the youngest cantor in Europe. The Finkelsteins went on to record two albums of original Israeli and cantorial songs. At age 18, Meir became the cantor for one of London's most prestigious congregations, Golders Green Synagogue. While working at this congregation, he graduated from the Royal College of Music with an ARCM degree in voice, composition and piano. Move to the USA A few years later he moved to the United States to become the cantor at Beth Hillel Congregation of Wilmette, Illinois. In 1982 he was appointed cantor of Sinai Temple in Los Angeles, a congregation he served for eighteen years. During his tenure with Sinai Temple, Finkelstein composed more than 100 settings for the liturgy while simultaneously enjoying a successful career as a Hollywood composer/arranger. He scored numerous television shows, including episodes of Dallas and Falcon's Crest, as well as many made-for-TV movies. He collaborated with Steven Spielberg, composing music for the Visual History Foundation's award-winning documentary, \\"Survivors of the Holocaust\\". Finkelstein's next cantorial position was at Congregation Beth Tzedec of Toronto, where he worked for three years before moving to Congregation Shaarey Zedek in Southfield, Michigan. On 1 July 2013, he became the cantor at Congregation Beth Yeshurun in Houston, Texas. Finkelstein also works as a producer and arranger, and has collaborated on many of his colleagues' albums. He was one of the \\"Three Cantors,\\" along with Alberto Mizrahi and David Propis, performing in sold-out cantorial symphonic concerts in Houston, Texas in 1995 and 1996. He also lectures on the history of Jewish liturgy as a scholar-in-residence at synagogues in the United States. Musical style According to Nick Strimple, Finkelstein's work is influenced both by his British musical training and American musical theater. Finkelstein's contemporary Jewish music is sung in synagogues throughout the world. His song L'dor Vador (From Generation to Generation) is one of his most popular. In 1993 he composed a Jewish requiem for victims of terror, Nishmat Tzedek (Soul of Righteousness). In 1995 he premiered an oratorio, \\"Liberation: A Choral Symphony\\", commemorating the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi death camps, at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles. The performance featured the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, the Los Angeles Master Chorale, and soloists. Family Finkelstein's wife, Monica, is a practicing attorney at law in the greater Detroit area. They have two children, Noah and Emily. Finkelstein also has two grown children in Los Angeles, Nadia and Adam, by his first wife, Leba Nemeth, daughter of the late Rabbi Morris Nemeth of Liverpool's Greenbank Drive and London's St. Petersburg Place synagogues. In 2015, Finkelstein moved to Houston, Texas with his family and works as head Chazzan at Congregation Beth Yeshurun.

Fossils of Jaekelopterus have been discovered in deposits of Early Devonian age, from the Pragian and Emsian stages. There are two known species: the type species J. rhenaniae from brackish to fresh water strata in the Rhineland, and J. howelli from estuarine strata in Wyoming. The generic name combines the name of German paleontologist Otto Jaekel, who described the type species, and the Greek word œÄœÑŒµœÅœåŒΩ (pteron) meaning \\"wing\\". Based on the isolated fossil remains of a large chelicera (claw) from the Klerf Formation of Germany, J. rhenaniae has been estimated to have reached a size of around 2.3‚Äì2.6 metres (7.5‚Äì8.5 ft), making it the largest arthropod ever discovered, surpassing other large arthropods such as fellow eurypterids Acutiramus and Pterygotus and the millipede Arthropleura. J. howelli was much smaller, reaching 80 centimetres (2.6 ft) in length. In overall appearance, Jaekelopterus is similar to other pterygotid eurypterids, possessing a large, expanded telson (the hindmost segment of the body) and enlarged pincers and forelimbs. Both species of Jaekelopterus were first described as species of the closely related Pterygotus but were raised as a separate genus based on an observed difference in the genital appendage. Though this feature has since proved to be a misidentification, other features distinguishing the genus from its relatives have been identified, including a telson with a triangular shape and a different inclination of the denticles of the claws. The chelicerae and compound eyes of Jaekelopterus indicate it was active and powerful with high visual acuity, most likely an apex predator in the ecosystems of Early Devonian Euramerica. Although eurypterids such as Jaekelopterus are often called \\"sea scorpions\\", the strata in which Jaekelopterus fossils have been found suggest that it lived in fresh water environments.  Description  Restoration of J. rhenaniae Jaekelopterus is the largest known eurypterid and the largest known arthropod to have ever existed. This was determined based on a chelicera (claw) from the Emsian Klerf Formation of Willwerath, Germany, that measures long, but is missing a quarter of its length, suggesting that the full chelicera would have been long. If the ratio of body length to chelicera length matches those of other giant pterygotids, such as Acutiramus and Pterygotus, where the ratio between claw size and body length is relatively consistent, the organism that possessed the chelicera would have measured between in length. With the chelicerae extended, another metre would be added to this length. This estimate exceeds the maximum body size of all other known giant arthropods by almost half a metre even if the extended chelicerae are not included. Jaekelopterus is similar to other pterygotid eurypterids in its overall morphology, distinguished by its triangular telson (the hindmost segment of its body) and inclined principal denticles on its cheliceral rami (the moving part of the claws). The pterygotids, a group of highly derived (\\"advanced\\") eurypterids, differ from other groups in several features, especially in the chelicerae and the telson. The chelicerae of the Pterygotidae are enlarged and robust, clearly adapted for active prey capture, with chelae (pincers) more similar to the claws of some modern crustaceans, with well-developed teeth on the claws, relative to the chelicerae of other eurypterid groups. Another feature distinguishing the group from other eurypterid groups is their flattened and expanded telsons, likely used as rudders when swimming. J. howelli, known from over 30 specimens, has an almost identical pattern of denticulation on the chelicerae as J. rhenaniae and also preserves a flattened posterior margin of the telson, which results in a triangular shape, as in J. rhenaniae. Its serrated telson margin and the massive elongation of the second intermediate denticle clearly distinguishes it from J. rhenaniae. Furthermore, the type A genital appendage is not bifurcated at its end. J. howelli is much smaller than J. rhenaniae, reaching 80 centimetres (2.6 ft) in length. Supplementary information History of research Illustration of the holotype specimen of \\"Pterygotus rhenaniae\\", a pretelson, by Otto Jaekel, 1914 Jaekelopterus was originally described as a species of Pterygotus, P. rhenaniae, in 1914 by German palaeontologist Otto Jaekel based on an isolated fossil pretelson (the segment directly preceding the telson) he received that had been discovered at Alken in Lower Devonian deposits of the Rhineland in Germany. Jaekel considered the pretelson to be characteristic of Pterygotus, other discovered elements differing little from previously known species of that genus, such as P. buffaloensis, and he estimated the length of the animal in life to be about 1 metre (1.5 metres if the chelicerae are included, 3.3 and 4.9 ft). Based on more comprehensive material, including genital appendages, chelicerae and fragments of the metastoma (a large plate that is part of the abdomen) and telson discovered by German palaeontologist Walter R. Gross near Overath, Germany, Norwegian palaeontologist Leif St√∏rmer provided a more comprehensive and detailed description of the species in 1936. St√∏rmer interpreted the genital appendages as being segmented, distinct from other species of Pterygotus. British palaeontologist Charles D. Waterston erected the genus Jaekelopterus in 1964 to accommodate Pterygotus rhenaniae, which he considered sufficiently distinct from other species of Pterygotus to warrant its own genus, primarily due to the abdominal appendages of Jaekelopterus being segmented as opposed to those of Pterygotus. Waterston diagnosed Jaekelopterus as a pterygotid with segmented genital appendages, a trapezoid prosoma, narrow and long chelicerae with terminal teeth almost at right angles to the rami and the primary teeth slightly angled anteriorly and with a telson with an expanded terminal spine and dorsal keel. The generic name honours Otto Jaekel; the Greek word œÄœÑŒµœÅœåŒΩ (pteron), meaning \\"wing\\", is a common epithet in eurypterid names. In 1974, St√∏rmer erected a new family to house the genus, Jaekelopteridae, due to the supposed considerable differences between the genital appendage of Jaekelopterus and other pterygotids. This diverging feature has since been proven to simply represent a misinterpretation by St√∏rmer in 1936, the genital appendage of Jaekelopterus in fact being unsegmented like that of Pterygotus. As such, the family Jaekelopteridae has subsequently been rejected and treated as synonymous with the family Pterygotidae. Another species of Pterygotus, P. howelli, was named by American palaeontologist Erik Kjellesvig-Waering and St√∏rmer in 1952 based on a fossil telson and tergite (the dorsal part of a body segment) from Lower Devonian deposits of the Beartooth Butte Formation in Wyoming. The species name howelli honours Dr. Benjamin Howell of Princeton University, who loaned the fossil specimens examined in the description to Kjellesvig-Waering and St√∏rmer. This species was assigned to Jaekelopterus as Jaekelopterus howelli by Norwegian palaeontologist O. Erik Tetlie in 2007.  Classification  Mineralientage M√ºnchen Fossil paddle (A‚ÄìB) and metastoma (C‚ÄìG) of J. howelli Jaekelopterus is classified within the family Pterygotidae in the superfamily Pterygotioidea. Jaekelopterus is similar to Pterygotus, virtually only distinct in features of its genital appendage and potentially its telson. The close similarities between the two genera have prompted some researchers to question if the pterygotids are oversplit on the generic level. Based on some similarities in the genital appendage, American palaeontologists James C. Lamsdell and David A. Legg suggested in 2010 that Jaekelopterus, Pterygotus and even Acutiramus could be synonyms of each other. Though differences have been noted in chelicerae, these structures were questioned as the basis of generic distinctions in eurypterids by Charles D. Waterston in 1964 since their morphology is dependent on lifestyle and varies throughout ontogeny (the development of the organism following its birth). Whilst telson morphology can be used to distinguish genera in eurypterids, Lamsdell and Legg noted that the triangular telson of Jaekelopterus might still fall within the morphological range of the paddle-shaped telsons present in Pterygotus and Acutiramus. Genital appendages can vary even within genera; for instance, the genital appendage of Acutiramus changes from species to species, being spoon- shaped in earlier species and then becoming bilobed and eventually beginning to look similar to the appendage of Jaekelopterus. Lamsdell and Legg concluded that an inclusive phylogenetic analysis with multiple species of Acutiramus, Pterygotus and Jaekelopterus is required to resolve whether the genera are synonyms of each other. The cladogram below is based on the nine best-known pterygotid species and two outgroup taxa (Slimonia acuminata and Hughmilleria socialis). Jaekelopterus had previously been classified as a basal sister taxon to the rest of the Pterygotidae since its description as a separate genus by Waterston in 1964 due to its supposedly segmented genital appendages (fused and undivided in other pterygotids), but restudy of the specimens in question revealed that the genital appendage of Jaekelopterus also was undivided. The material examined and phylogenetic analysis conducted by British palaeontologist Simon J. Braddy, German palaeontologist Markus Poschmann and O. Erik Tetlie in 2007 revealed that Jaekelopterus was not a basal pterygotid, but one of the most derived taxa in the group. The cladogram also contains the maximum sizes reached by the species in question, which was suggested to possibly have been an evolutionary trait of the group per Cope's Rule (\\"phyletic gigantism\\") by Braddy, Poschmann and Tetlie.  Palaeobiology  = Gigantism = The size of J. rhenaniae (larger) and J. howelli (smaller) compared to a human The pterygotid eurypterids include many of the largest known eurypterids, such as Pterygotus and Acutiramus. Several factors have been suggested that might have contributed to the unprecedented large size of Jaekelopterus, its relatives and other large Paleozoic invertebrates, such as predation, courtship behaviour, competition and environmental resources. Factors such as respiration, the energy costs of moulting, locomotion and the actual properties of the exoskeleton restrict the size of arthropods. Other than the robust and heavily sclerotised claws, most of the preserved large body segments of the pterygotids are thin and unmineralised. Even tergites and sternites (the plates that form the surfaces of the abdominal segments) are generally preserved as paper-thin compressions, suggesting that pterygotids were very lightweight in construction. Similar lightweight adaptations can be observed in other Paleozoic giant arthropods, such as the giant millipede-like Arthropleura, and it has been suggested to be vital for the evolution of giant arthropod sizes.Kraus, O., Brauckmann, C. (2003-08-26). \\"Fossil giants and surviving dwarfs. Arthropleurida and Pselaphognatha (Atelocerata, Diplopoda): characters, phylogenetic relationships and construction\\" . Verhandlungen des Naturwissenschaftlichen Vereins in Hamburg. 40. A lightweight build decreases the influence of factors that restrict body size. Despite being the largest arthropods, the lightweight build of Jaekelopterus and other giant pterygotid eurypterids meant they likely were not the heaviest. Other giant eurypterids, particularly the deep- bodied walking forms in the Hibbertopteridae, such as the almost 2-metre-long Hibbertopterus, may have rivalled the pterygotids and other giant arthropods in weight, if not surpassed them. American palaeontologist Alexander Kaiser and South African palaeontologist Jaco Klok suggested in 2008 that the massive size estimates for Jaekelopterus are exaggerated, noting that the size estimates assume that the relative proportions between the chelicerae and body length would stay the same as the animal matured. The denticles (the serrations of the claws) were observed as showing positive allometry (being proportionally larger in larger specimens), which Kaiser and Klok suggest could have occurred in the chelicerae as a whole. Furthermore, the largest coxae (limb segments) found of the same species, measuring wide, suggest a total maximum body length of only . Positive allometry has not been demonstrated in eurypterid chelicerae as a whole in any other eurypterid genus, including in the closest relatives of Jaekelopterus. There are also some undescribed specimens of J. rhenaniae similar in proportions to the large chelicera, including another claw found in the same strata as the original find. In the opinion of Braddy, Poschmann and Tetlie, who replied to Kaiser and Klok the same year, the size estimates around remain the most accurate estimates on the maximum size of the species yet. = Ontogeny = left Like all other arthropods, eurypterids matured through a sequence of stages called \\"instars\\" consisting of periods of ecdysis (moulting) followed by rapid growth. Unlike many arthropods, such as insects and crustaceans, chelicerates (the group to which eurypterids like Jaekelopterus belongs, alongside other organisms such as horseshoe crabs, sea spiders and arachnids) are generally direct developers, meaning that there are no extreme morphological changes after they have hatched. Extant xiphosurans hatch without the full complement of adult opisthosomal appendages (appendages attached to the opisthosoma, the posterior segments of the body), but extant spiders are fully direct developers. Studies of fossil specimens of Strobilopterus and Jaekelopterus suggest that the ontogeny of eurypterids broadly parallelled that of modern horseshoe crabs, but that eurypterids (like arachnids) were true direct developers, hatching with the same number of appendages and segments as adults. Though several fossilised instars of Jaekelopterus howelli are known, the fragmentary and incomplete status of the specimens makes it difficult to study its ontogeny in detail. Despite this, there are some noticeable changes occurring in the chelicerae, telson and metastoma. Four of the J. howelli specimens studied by Lamsdell and Selden (2013) preserve the chelicerae in enough detail to allow for study of the denticles. Two of these chelicerae were assumed to come from juveniles and two were assumed to be from adults. The morphology of the chelicerae is similar across all ages, with the same arrangement and number of denticles, but there were also some noticeable differences. Particularly, the principal denticles grew in size relative to the intermediate denticles, being 1.5 times the size of the intermediate denticles in juveniles, but up to 3.5 times the size of the intermediate denticles in adults. Furthermore, the terminal denticle was far larger and more robust in adult specimens than in juveniles. Perhaps most extreme of all, the second intermediate denticle is not different in size from the other intermediate denticles in juveniles, but it is massively elongated in adults, where it is more than twice the length of any principal denticle. Though such growth in the denticles of pterygotids has been described in other genera, the massive elongation of the second intermediate denticle through ontogeny is unique to Jaekelopterus, particularly to J. howelli. The metastoma of Jaekelopterus also altered its dimensions as the animal matured. In J. rhenaniae, the relative width of the metastoma decreased through ontogeny. The metastoma in J. howelli is also broader in juveniles than in adults, although the length‚Äìwidth ratios measured in juveniles and adults were not as disparate as assumed, being 1.43 in juveniles and 1.46 in adults. Such a change in metastomal dimensions has been noted in other eurypterid genera as well, such as Stoermeropterus, Moselopterus and Strobilopterus.  Palaeoecology  = Lifestyle and environment = Fossil chelicerae of J. howelli. The morphology and body construction of Jaekelopterus and other eurypterids in the Pterygotidae suggests they were adapted to a completely aquatic lifestyle. Braddy, Poschmann and Tetlie considered in a 2007 study that it was highly unlikely that an arthropod with the size and build of Jaekelopterus would be able to walk on land. Eurypterids such as Jaekelopterus are often popularly referred to as \\"sea scorpions\\", but the deposits from which Jaekelopterus fossils have been discovered suggest that it lived in non-marine aquatic environments. The Beartooth Butte Formation in Wyoming, where J. howelli fossils have been discovered, has been interpreted as a quiet, shallow estuarine environment. The fossil sites yielding J. rhenaniae in the Rhineland have also been interpreted as having been part of a shallow aquatic environment with brackish to fresh water. The chelicerae of Jaekelopterus are enlarged, robust and have a curved free ramus and denticles of different lengths and sizes, all adaptations that correspond to strong puncturing and grasping abilities in extant scorpions and crustaceans. Some puncture wounds on fossils of the poraspid agnathan fish Lechriaspis patula from the Devonian of Utah were likely caused by Jaekelopterus howelli. The latest research indicates that Jaekelopterus was an active and visual predator. Fully grown Jaekelopterus would have been apex predators in their environments and likely preyed upon smaller arthropods (including resorting to cannibalism) and early vertebrates. A powerful and active predator, Jaekelopterus was likely highly agile and possessed high manoeuvrability. The hydromechanics of the swimming paddles and telsons of Jaekelopterus and other pterygotids suggest that all members of the group were capable of hovering, forward locomotion and quick turns. Though they were not necessarily rapidly swimming animals, they were likely able to give chase to prey in habitats such as lagoons and estuaries. = Visual system = Fossilised exocones (the cone-shaped lens-cylinders which make up the compound eye) of J. rhenaniae. The cheliceral morphology and visual acuity of the pterygotid eurypterids separates them into distinct ecological groups. The primary method for determining visual acuity in arthropods is by determining the number of lenses in their compound eyes and the interommatidial angle (IOA), which is the angle between the optical axes of adjacent lenses. The IOA is especially important as it can be used to distinguish different ecological roles in arthropods, being low in modern active arthropod predators. Both Jaekelopterus rhenaniae and Pterygotus anglicus had high visual acuity, as suggested by the low IOA and many lenses in their compound eyes. Further studies on the compound eyes of fossilised specimens of J. rhenaniae, including a large specimen with the right eye preserved from the uppermost Siegenian and a small and likely juvenile specimen, confirmed the high visual acuity of the genus. The overall average IOA of Jaekelopterus (0.87¬∞) is comparable to that of modern predatory arthropods. The visual acuity of Jaekelopterus increased with age, the smaller specimens having relatively worse eyesight. This is consistent with other pterygotids, such as Acutiramus, and has been interpreted as indicating that adult Jaekelopterus lived in darker environments, such as in deeper water. Trace fossil evidence of eurypterids also supports such a conclusion, indicating that eurypterids migrated to nearshore environments to mate and spawn. Jaekelopterus had a frontally overlapping visual field, e.g. stereoscopic vision, typical of predatory animals. Structurally, eurypterid eyes were almost identical to the eyes of horseshoe crabs. The square-like pattern of the receptor cells in the compound eyes of Jaekelopterus is also similar, but not identical, to the pattern in horseshoe crabs, suggesting a specialised visual system. The photoreceptors are unusually large in Jaekelopterus. At around 70 ¬µm, they are far larger than those of humans (1-2 ¬µm) and most arthropods (also 1-2 ¬µm) but they match those of modern horseshoe crabs in size. The unique eyes of modern horseshoe crabs are highly distinct from eyes of other modern arthropods and allow increased edge-perception and enhance contrasts, important for animals in low and scattered light conditions. As the eyes of Jaekelopterus were very similar, it too likely had the same adaptations. With its highly specialised eyes, Jaekelopterus was very well adapted to its predatory lifestyle.

Toward the end of their run as Sleze, discussions arose about changing their name to Alice in Chains. However, due to concerns over the reference to female bondage, the group ultimately chose to spell it as Alice N' Chains. They performed under this moniker over about a 12-month period and recorded two demos before breaking up on friendly terms in 1987. One of its members, Layne Staley, ultimately took the name that he and his former bandmates had initially flirted with when he joined a different group a few months later that became known as Alice in Chains. History Vocalist Layne Staley, guitarist Nick Pollock, bassist Johnny Bacolas, and drummer James Bergstrom began performing in what would become the last lineup of Sleze in 1986, when founding member Bacolas rejoined after a brief stint in another band called Ascendant and took up the bass slot for the first time; originally he played guitar. After his return, Bacolas says the band began to discuss changing their name to Alice in Chains due to a conversation he had with Russ Klatt, singer from Slaughterhouse Five: However, Staley's mother Nancy McCallum has said she still did not approve of this at first: Johnny Bacolas stated that the decision to use the apostrophe-N combination in their name had nothing to do with the Los Angeles band Guns N' Roses. The name change happened in 1986, a year before Guns N' Roses became a household name with their first album Appetite for Destruction, which was released in July 1987. According to Staley, the reason they chose this name was because they wanted to dress in drag and play heavy metal as a joke. The band performed around the Seattle area playing Slayer and Armored Saint covers. Discography Alice N' Chains recorded two demos known primarily as \\"Demo No. 1\\" and \\"Demo No. 2\\"; both from 1987. Physical copies of the cassettes are extremely rare as only 100 of \\"Demo No. 1\\" were made, although bootleg copies can be found on filesharing programs. Pre-production for \\"Demo No. 1\\" began whilst the band were still calling themselves Sleze and with a different bass player named Mike Mitchell, who appears on the tracks \\"Fat Girls\\" and \\"Over the Edge\\" according to producer Tim Branom. Recording for these two tracks took place at London Bridge Studio with the help of its founding engineer brother Rick and Raj Parashar. A few months later, Mitchell left the band and Bacolas rejoined as their bass player. They added one more song called \\"Lip Lock Rock\\" to the demo before changing their name to Alice N' Chains. =Demo No. 1 track listing= # \\"Lip Lock Rock\\" ‚Äì 4:24 # \\"Fat Girls\\" ‚Äì 3:39 # \\"Over the Edge\\" ‚Äì 2:44 =Demo No. 2 track listing= # \\"Sealed with a Kiss\\" ‚Äì 2:49 # \\"Ya Yeah Ya\\" ‚Äì 3:11 # \\"Glamorous Girls\\" ‚Äì 2:48 # \\"Don't Be Satisfied\\" ‚Äì 3:27 # \\"Hush, Hush\\" ‚Äì 2:29 # \\"Football\\" ‚Äì 2:01 Post-Alice N' Chains Shortly after Alice N' Chains broke up, Staley joined a different group of musicians led by guitarist Jerry Cantrell that eventually took up the name Alice in Chains. This band rose to international fame as part of the grunge movement of the early 1990s, along with other Seattle bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. Staley also formed the supergroup Mad Season along with Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready and Screaming Trees drummer Barrett Martin. Meanwhile, Pollock formed the band My Sister's Machine, taking up mostly vocal duties as their primary lyricist.MSM: Newest Vein of Gold in Seattle's Hard-Rock Quarry, \\"Los Angeles Times\\" May 15, 1992. Retrieved on April 28, 2011. He later sang in the band Soulbender, which also featured Queensr√øche guitarist Michael Wilton. Bergstrom became a founding member of the band Second Coming and was later joined by Bacolas, who replaced Ron \\"Junkeye\\" Holt on bass. Staley made a guest appearance on their debut album L.O.V.Evil. This band signed to Capitol Records in May 1998 and recorded two more studio albums and one extended play before breaking up in 2008. Since then, Bacolas has recorded and released music with the bands The Crying Spell and Lotus Crush.

Military actions In retaliation for perceived slights by the British while campaigning with them against the French in the French and Indian War in 1758, Moytoy took his band and left the campaign to return home. He stole a number of British horses in compensation. The rest of the Cherokee allies were said to agree with his perception of the British, but the leaders Attakullakulla and Ostenaco did not agree with his actions. Moytoy was a war chief in the conflict that began in 1759 between the Cherokee and British. Etymology Moytoy's name comes from the Tsalagi A-Ma-Do-Ya (or Amatoya), \\"Rainmaker.\\" The name is a Cherokee family name which became a title after being passed down through several generations. All seven of the Cherokee chief delegates to King George II in 1730 were members of the Moytoy Family. The original form of the name was \\"Ama Matai\\" (pronounced Ama-Madey in Cherokee). Ama is the Tsalagi word for water and Matai (Mah-Tey) is a French word meaning \\"to master.\\" The title, Ama Matai (water master/water conqueror) became the names Amatoya and Moytoy.

The film is broadly a docudrama. It covers the formation of Solidarity. The action centers around work and labor organizing in the Lenin Shipyard in Gda≈Ñsk, Polish People's Republic. The film follows the life of Agnieszka Kowalska (Katharina Thalbach) in about three segments covering first her life as a dedicated worker in communist Poland of the early 1960s (DVD chapters 1-4), then following events leading to the Polish 1970 protests (chapters 5-10), and finally the early 1980s, including the dedication of the Monument to the Fallen Shipyard Workers of 1970, the Gda≈Ñsk Agreement, and Martial law in Poland (chapters 11-15). The character of Agnieszka is loosely based on at least two women, the crane operator Anna Walentynowicz and the diminutive shipyard nurse Alina Pienkowska, with invented or distorted facts.Hearing discontent of the workers after Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa ended strike after demands were met, Pienkowska grabbed Walentynowicz by the arm and announced solidarity strike in sympathy with other striking establishments, and they together managed to close the shipyard gates to keep workers inside and stop Wa≈Çƒôsa from leaving the shipyard. Pienkowska called Jacek Kuro≈Ñ in Warsaw to announce the strike.  Plot  Agnieszka Kowalska is a hardworking welder in the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk. She is honored as a heroic worker, \\"activist of the Year\\" award for being a superquota worker. This is her tenth time winning the award, so she is given a television. She even gives a speech of how she came to the shipyard in 1950 with nothing, and now she has a profession and a home. She truly seems thankful for what the shipyard has given her. However, after the official ceremony, other women workers confront her for working so hard and they are clearly not even trying to beat the quotas set forth by the Party. At a meeting of Party and union members, Agnieszka tries to argue for a longer lunch break but the officials refuse to budge, especially Sobecki. Agnieszka is clearly frustrated by the intractability of the officials and their lack of compassion for tough working conditions at the shipyard. Independently, she organizes bringing soup to workers so they will have enough time to eat. Sobecki confronts her, but she mocks him after he threatens to report her. Agnieszka decides that she is willing to take a pay cut and switch jobs with Mateusz, a crane operator. She learns to read and write, growing closer with her new neighbor Kazimierz. She eventually passes the exam, becoming the first female crane operator. A few months later, Agnieszka is diagnosed with kidney cancer. She is distraught, unsure of what will happen to her young son Krystian after she dies. Kazimierz agrees to raise Krystian as his own son, and Kazimierz soon marries Agnieszka. However, on their honeymoon, Kazimierz suddenly dies of a heart attack, leaving Agnieszka a widow. During a difficult time, a Party official wants Agnieszka to ask the workers to go even faster to meet the shipyard deadlines. She refuses, because she knows everyone is being overworked and is terribly exhausted. Everyone has been doing overtime for weeks. Agnieszka is so frustrated, she even tells the official to kiss her ass. The official tells all of the workers to get back to work, even threatening to fire them if they do not keep going. Due to the exhaustion, there is an accidental fire in which multiple men are badly burned. Agnieszka does her best to help pull men out of the fire with her crane but there are 21 workers killed, including her friend Mateusz. Refusing to accept culpability, the shipyard director decides to withhold all pensions or payments to the surviving dependents. The shipyard and its union even forge timecards to hide the extreme overtime they were making workers do. However, they offer to give Agnieszka her overtime if she drops talk of the forged timecards. She renounces Bochnan and curses him. Krystian is growing up;he has a girlfriend, and is doing well enough in school to go to a Polytechnic. However, Agnieszka's defiance of the Party and shipyard union is hurting her family politically and may affect her son's ability to get into a good school. It is revealed that Sobecki is in fact Krystian's father. Agnieszka goes to his office and begs Sobecki for help. He agrees, if he can meet his son. Out of desperation, her son has enlisted so that afterwards he may go to a polytechnic. The next scene takes place during the 1970 strikes, in which workers were killed. Agnieszka is arrested and beaten. She returns home to find her son in the uniform of those who had just been mistreating her. Krystian reveals he knows about his true father, and Agnieszka tells him the story of how she came to know Sobecki. The film fast forward to 1978. Sobecki's secretary recruits Agnieszka to join an underground newspaper, Robotnik. Very quickly after this, Pope John Paul II, a Pole, is elected as the new pope. Agnieszka helps to write and then distribute these underground newsletters to try and educate workers about what is really going on in the shipyards. The shipyard officials do not approve of her new activities, so she is put on lockdown during her shifts so she cannot distribute more pamphlets. They finally find a convincing reason for firing her, theft for not returning her deceased husband's trumpet, and so they fire her. In response to her firing, the shipyard workers all go on strike. The strikes snowball, with many other shipyards and even streetcar drivers striking in solidarity with the Lenin shipyard workers. Talks are held, and Leszek agrees to simple compromises that only affect the Lenin shipyard. Agnieszka makes a speech and convinces Leszek to lead the workers in continuing another strike in solidarity with the other workers who had helped them win the concessions. Archive footage is played of the 21 Accords (1980), and Solidarity is born.

The act was designed during apartheid to secretly arrange protection primarily for privately owned strategic sites. It enables the government to compel private owners, as well as state-owned corporations, to safeguard such sites owned by them at their own cost. The act, still in force and unamended since apartheid, came under the spotlight after President Jacob Zuma's Nkandla homestead was declared a National Key Point in 2010 amid controversy over public expenditure on upgrades to the property. , the act is officially under review. Apartheid legislation In an apartheid-era debate on disinvestment from South Africa in 1990, chief representative of the African National Congress (ANC) to the United States Lindiwe Mabuza said the act contributed to institutionalised oppression of black South Africans. The ANC, which has been the country's ruling party since 1994, made a submission to a special Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearing on the role of business during apartheid in 1997 in which it characterises the act as \\"the privatisation of repression\\" and states: \\"The National Key Points Act of 1980 created another network of collaboration between the apartheid security forces and the private sector.\\" The act contributed to significant growth in the private security industry and \\"the integration of state and private sector security companies with a uniform security strategy\\". In February 2013 Mosiuoa Lekota, COPE leader, former ANC member and former Minister of Defence, described the act still in force unamended under an ANC government as \\"dastardly apartheid legislation\\". In November 2013 Lekota said in a Parliamentary debate about the act: \\"I am reminded about George Orwell's Animal Farm published in 1945. At the end, the past perpetrators of oppression and the revolutionaries who come to power are indistinguishable. Yet, how quickly, brazenly and unapologetically the ruling party uses an act it would have despised and rejected before, and rightly so, to shield its embarrassment and do damage control. Using a past law that does not even have a veneer of transparency, accountability or constitutionality devalues our constitution. The strategic abuse of the National Key Points Act is visibly and nakedly an abuse of office. It is regressive and objectionable. Only those who are morally bankrupt will use the old act as it is.\\" Administration of the act , the administration of the act falls under the Government Security Regulator subprogramme of the Protection and Security Services programme of the South African Police Service (SAPS). The role of the Government Security Regulator is described in various official sources as follows: *The SAPS Annual Report 2010/2011 states: \\"The Government Security Regulator provides for security regulations, evaluations and the administration of National Key Points and strategic installations.\\" *The SAPS Annual Report 2011/2012 and the SAPS Annual Report 2012/2013 states: \\"The Government Security Regulator relates to National Key Points evaluated in compliance with the National Key Points Act. Strategic installations were audited in terms of the Minimum Physical Security Standard guidelines at national and provincial government departments.\\" *According to the South African Defence Review 2013, the safeguarding of critical infrastructure assigned to SAPS \\"entails the administration, protection oversight and at times the physical protection of national key points\\" and the Department of Defence plays a supportive role. The Government Sector Security Council (GSSC) was launched by SAPS in 2006 to primarily coordinate, monitor and regulate security of certain National Key Points that are not privately owned. National Key Points include diverse critical infrastructure sites such as airports, power stations, banks and sites in the munitions and petrochemical industries including oil refineries. The majority are not state-owned. The list of sites declared as National Key Points was formerly not available to the public, but it was released in January 2015 pursuant to an order of the Johannesburg High Court. It was revealed that the list contained 204 entries; there are a further 248 state-owned strategic installations which do not fall under the act. An advisory committee appointed by then Minister of Police Nathi Mthethwa in May 2013 clarified that: *Military facilities fall under the Defence Act, 2002 and prison facilities fall under the Correctional Service Act, 1998 and are therefore not required to be declared National Key Points. *Designated areas and sites have been declared and in some cases the declaration does not cover the entire site, for example the declaration in respect of airports only applies to designated areas and not the entire airport. *There are no restrictions under the act that prevent people from gathering next to National Key Points. Secrecy The government formerly asserted that it was not obliged to publicly disclose the details of sites that have been declared National Key Points. The Department of Police refused the requests of the Right2Know Campaign in 2012, and the Democratic Alliance Parliamentary Opposition in 2013, to disclose a list of National Key Points citing security concerns. This refusal was appealed to the Johannesburg High Court, which ordered the government to release the list. On 22 January 2015 the government abandoned its attempt to appeal the ruling, and the list was made public. The act furthermore restricts the disclosure of information regarding security measures implemented at National Key Points and any incident that occurred at a National Key Point, defined as \\"any occurrence arising out of or relating to terroristic activities, sabotage, espionage or subversion\\". Such disclosure could constitute a criminal offence subject to penalties, but the public and journalists were unable to comply with the act as they did not know which sites have been declared National Key Points. Critics including academics, environmentalists, the media, the Right2Know Campaign, the Institute for Security Studies and opposition parties in Parliament have expressed their concerns about the lack of transparency about National Key Points and the implications thereof, in particular: *the use of the act to avoid government accountability on matters of public interest such as corruption and environmental hazards, *the use of the act to protect corporate interests, *the use of the act to restrict freedom of expression entrenched in the Bill of Rights, and *the lack of clarity on offences and penalties that may be imposed in terms of the act on the uninformed public and journalists. Legislative review The act has been amended twice, during apartheid in 1984 and 1985, expanding the ministerial powers granted by the act. A new piece of legislation, the National Key Points Act and Strategic Installations Bill, was drafted in 2007 to replace the act when Charles Nqakula was Minister for Safety and Security (later known as Minister of Police). The bill was opposed by labour and civic organisations as it represented few changes in the original legislation and was considered equally draconian and was not finalised. The draft bill made provision for privately owned National Key Points, publicly owned Strategic Installations and a temporary designation of Places of Importance for privately or publicly owned sites. In 2012 constitutional law expert Pierre de Vos stated that the act is outdated, referring to the Official Secrets Act of 1956 repealed in 1982, and contravenes the country's post-apartheid constitution. In February 2013 Deputy Minister of Public Works Jeremy Cronin publicly criticised the act, saying \\"This Parliament does need to look at this anachronistic and problematic piece of legislation, it may well be unconstitutional.\\" On 30 May 2013, then Minister of Police Nathi Mthethwa announced plans to table a redrafted bill in Parliament early in 2014. In November 2013 then Leader of the Opposition Lindiwe Mazibuko tabled a private member's bill, the Protection of Critical Infrastructure Bill, in Parliament with a more transparent system subject to Parliamentary oversight and without the existing wide discretionary ministerial powers open to abuse. Mthethwa subsequently presented the findings and recommendations of an advisory committee he appointed in May 2013 to Parliament, stating \\"The National Key Points Act has been criticized in the recent past for being based on old apartheid legislation. It also became clear to us that this Act needed to be revised for various reasons, key amongst these is the need to align it with the Constitution and other more recent legislations. In addition there has been criticism that the actual use of the Act to address infrastructure security is inappropriate.\\" In March 2014, Mthethwa announced that the legislative review would be held over to the country's next administration following the 2014 general election in May. Following the election, Mthethwa was replaced as Minister of Police by Nkosinathi Nhleko, who was appointed to President Jacob Zuma's cabinet in his second term of office. In a submission to Parliament on 14 August 2014 regarding his Nkandla homestead, Zuma said Nhleko must expedite the legislative review. Nkandla homestead President Jacob Zuma's Nkandla homestead was declared a National Key Point in 2010. The act came under the spotlight during revelations about public expenditure on President Jacob Zuma's private residence at Nkandla, first exposed by Mail & Guardian journalist Mandy Rossouw in December 2009. The site was declared a National Key Point by then Minister of Police Nathi Mthethwa in April 2010, and the act was invoked by government officials in an attempt to justify the expenditure, withhold information about it, and prevent anyone from taking or publishing photographs of the homestead. In addition to public expenditure on upgrades not related to security, Zuma did not safeguard his residence at his own cost in contravention of Mthethwa's declaration in terms of the act. In her final report on security upgrades to Zuma's Nkandla homestead published on 19 March 2014, Public Protector Thuli Madonsela found that Zuma had unduly benefited from the R246 million the state had spent on the upgrades, criticised Mthethwa and other government officials for maladministration and instructed Mthethwa to urgently institute a review of the act. Mthethwa's term of office as Minister of Police ended in May 2014. Following criticism in the media of the photo ban, the government released a clarifying statement that \\"Government has no problem with the media publishing pictures of National Key Points, including President Jacob Zuma's Nkandla residence, as it is part of their daily line of duty. However, zooming into safety and security features of National Key Points is a challenge as it compromises national security.\\" See also *Protection of State Information Bill (Secrecy Bill) *List of National Key Points References Further reading  External links  * Right2Know ‚Äì National Key Points * Text of the Act 1980 in South African law South African legislation Censorship in South Africa Apartheid laws in South Africa Infrastructure in South Africa ","title":"National Key Points Act, 1980"},{"id":"14342268","text":"is a yonkoma Japanese manga series by Tsuyoshi ≈åhashi which was serialized in Manga Club.

It has two separate dorsal fins on its bright green back which contrasts with the silver to pale flanks and silvery underside. This species has a pointed head with small eyes and a rather rounded, blunt snout and an oblique mouth situated terminally with extendible jaws each equipped with a row of tiny forked teeth. Their gills are a golden-yellow. It has no lateral line but it has 63-65 scales where the lateral line would have been present. The first dorsal fine has 5-9 spines, the second dorsal fin has a single spine and 8-14 rays while the anal fin also has a single spine but has 19-25 rays and the pectoral fin has 13 rays. The juveniles are translucent and have three rows of pigmented scales on their back, becoming scattered on the caudal peduncle. Description The topsmelt silverside is found in the eastern Pacific along the western coast of North America from Vancouver Island in British Columbia south to Baja California and the Gulf of California. Habitat and biology The topsmelt silverside is a pelagic schooling fish which occurs in a wide variety of habitats at different times of the year. It is a common species in estuaries bit it has also been recorded along the oceanic shoreline and in kelp forest, off sandy beaches, and sometimes in offshore waters. They can frequently be found in and around man-mad structures such as pier pilings. They are frequently observed just below the surface and are most frequently found in the upper . During spring and summer months many of these fish move into estuaries while in the autumn and winter they move to more open coastlines where there are bays, rocky areas and beds of kelp. They can tolerate higher salinities than seawater and have been recorded inhabiting in salt evaporation ponds, as high as 80 ppt. The topsmelt silverside spawn in the warmer months, starting in March and ending in October, preferring to spawn where the salinity is around 30 ppt and the temperature ranges between . These fish prefer to spawn at night over submerged vegetation. After hatching in deeper water the larvae may move up the estuary. Juveniles, less than a year old, are the most frequent age class to occur in freshwater environments and as they age they move downstream towards more estuarine environments. The juvenlies feed on zooplankton but the adults are more benthic foragersand food items can include algae, chironomid larvae and amphipods, the presence of sand and gravel in the stomach contents being taken to be an indicator of bottom feeding. This species is often recorded leaping out of the water to escape pursuit larger predatory fishes such as mackerel or jacks.

One of Lemorande's first major jobs was production executive for the comedy Caddyshack. Lemorande proposed commissioning a gopher puppet in order to add, through additional shooting, a continuing story arc for the Gopher and the Bill Murray character. He was caught in the battle between screenwriter Doug Kenney and executive producer Jon Peters over Peters' insistence on a prominent role in the finished film for the infamous gopher puppet, which was not part of the original script. Lemorande soon joined up with Barbra Streisand to produce Yentl, for which they shared a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture ‚Äì Musical or Comedy. Lemorande wrote the film Electric Dreams, then followed it up by co-writing and producing with Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas the Disney 3D theme-park film Captain EO, starring Michael Jackson. It was Lemorande who proposed adding physical effects (such as smoke, strobe lights and fiber optic stars) to the film. For this reason, Lemorande is often referred to as the Father of 4D. Lemorande had a small speaking part in the film Yentl, and recently played the role of Father Lazarus in the Roland Joff√© film There Be Dragons, based on the life of Josemar√≠a Escriv√° (founder of Opus Dei), which was shot largely in Argentina.

Armed with improvised knives and bats the Japanese stormed the guard posts with what a military court of inquiry termed \\"a suicidal disregard of life.\\" 231 prisoners were killed during the ensuing fighting and 108 wounded. All of the remaining escapees were recaptured within days. Hardy was killed in the outbreak, as was Private Ralph Jones, who was also awarded the George Cross. Private Charles Henry Shepherd was the third Australian victim of the fighting at the camp, while Lieutenant Harry Doncaster was ambushed and killed while recapturing the escapees. On the night of the breakout, Hardy was manning the Number 2 Vickers machine gun alongside Jones when they were overwhelmed by Japanese prisoners and killed. Before he was killed, Hardy disabled the gun by removing the firing bolt and throwing it away, thus rendering the gun useless to the escaping Japanese. The court of inquiry found that the Australian soldiers had ceased fire as soon as they had reestablished control of the camp, and that many of the dead had either killed themselves or been killed by fellow prisoners, while many of the wounded had self-inflicted injuries.

McKim, Mead, and White renovation of the Entrance Hall in 1924 during the administration of Theodore Roosevelt. An 1882 photograph shows the Tiffany screen, Brumidi frescos, and encaustic tile floor. The Entrance Hall (also called the Grand Foyer) is the primary and formal entrance to the White House, the official residence of the President of the United States. The room is rectilinear in shape and measures approximately 31 by 44 feet. Located on the State Floor, the room is entered from outdoors through the North Portico, which faces the North Lawn and Pennsylvania Avenue. The south side of the room opens to the Cross Hall through a screen of paired Roman Doric columns. The east wall opens to the Grand Staircase. Hoban's 1792 and 1817 designs Architect James Hoban's original floor plans show a similar room, but with single columns separating the Entrance Hall and Cross Hall, and with the Grand Stair entering into the Cross Hall. Mid-19th century photographs show the room as rebuilt by Hoban following the 1814 White House fire. In these photographs two Ionic columns support a series of shallow arches, and a frieze of bas- relief anthemion encircling the room. The shafts of Hoban's columns are recorded as being a blue marble. With the north entrance to the White House used frequently in this period, it was not uncommon for cold air to push into the Entrance Hall and then pass through the spaciously separated columns into the Cross Hall beyond. To remedy the draft problem, President Martin Van Buren had floor-to-ceiling glass partitions installed between the Hoban columns. Changes by Walter and Brumidi In 1853 Thomas U. Walter installed a cast iron and clear glass screen between the Entrance Hall and Cross Hall to reduce drafts, and a complexly patterned Minton encaustic tile floor. In 1869 Constantino Brumidi, the fresco painter who had recently painted The Apotheosis of Washington in the ceiling of the new rotunda and Senate wing of the Capitol, applied highly ornamental painted decoration to the walls and ceilings including profile portraits of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. On the ceiling Brumidi painted allegorical figures of Union and Liberty. They have survived and are displayed in the ground floor of the White House in the Palm Room. Tiffany and the Aesthetic Movement In 1882 President Chester A. Arthur commissioned Louis Comfort Tiffany to replace Walter's clear glass panels in the screen and the front door with fashionable colored art glass. The patterns included American eagles, and a shield with stripes, stars, and the initials \\"U.S.\\" A high example of the Aesthetic Movement, Tiffany's glass would remain into the early 20th century. A recreation of the Tiffany screen was painted by artist Peter Waddell in 2004. McKim's return to Neoclassicism In 1902, soon after taking office and occupying the White House, President Theodore Roosevelt engaged architect Charles Follen McKim in the redesign of the White House. McKim reconfigured the house, adding wings, demolishing the greenhouses, and sweeping away the ornate late 19th century interiors. McKim attempted to make the White House interiors appear closer to how they had near the time of construction, during the period of the early republic. McKim's office McKim, Mead, and White researched the house's history, and where no clear documentation was available created rooms in the then popular Colonial Revival and Beaux Arts styles. In the Entrance Hall, McKim removed the Tiffany screen, Hoban's Ionic columns, and the ornamental painting. In its place he created a far simpler neoclassical interior. On the south side of the room is a screen of single and paired Roman Doric columns. Doric pilasters are used on the east, north and west wall. A robust entablature of triglyphs, garlanded bureaucrania, ornamental cuirass, and spread Roman eagles integrate the frieze and ceiling. A simple color palette of soft ochres, gray and white contrasted dramatically with the Victorian era interior. The presidential arms were cast in bronze and installed in the center of the room's floor. Bronze torch√®res, still in use, and a simple lantern with a cylindrical glass chimney lit the room. McKim's new finishes though robust in form were made of plaster and stucco over wood frames hastily added to Hoban's original surfaces. While the response to McKim's interiors were positive, the Entrance Hall has been criticized for being more appropriate to a public building than a home. Truman reconstruction By 1948 the White House had become physically unstable, and the house was temporarily abandoned while a major reconstruction took place. The building's interior was dismantled, the furnishings and decorative items were stored, and a new steel frame was built within the exterior walls. Truman used this opportunity to reposition the entrance to the Grand Stair. Architect Lorenzo Simmons Winslow explored several options for the reorientation of the Grand Stair before convincing President Truman of the present configuration where it opens to the center of the east wall of the Entrance Hall. Except for the new stair opening, most of McKim's design was followed but now reinterpreted in light gray Joliet marble instead of warm hued Sienna stone and painted plaster. Cut into the stone casement around the opening to the Grand Staircase are the seals of the thirteen original American states. The Truman era floor is laid in a tessellated pattern of Westbury cream and Vermont marble. Truman thought it inappropriate to walk across the seal of the president that McKim had placed in the floor, and had the bronze seal moved to the ground floor above the entrance to the Diplomatic Reception Room. In place of the bronze seal in the floor, Truman had a polychrome painted plaster seal installed above the entrance to the Blue Room. Kennedy restoration During the John F. Kennedy administration, the Entrance Hall (like most of the White House) underwent an extensive historic redecoration. The redecoration of the State Floor rooms, including the Entrance Hall, was overseen by American antiques autodidact Henry Francis du Pont and French interior designer St√©phane Boudin. Du Pont wanted a more historic approach to the White House, while Boudin preferred a French design aesthetic. Du Pont originally redecorated the Entrance Hall with two French pier tables, a settee, a card table, and two tables by Charles-Honor√© Lannuier. Boudin had all but the pier tables removed, and his style is the one which remained over the next several decades. Use over time When the White House interiors were first completed during the administration of John Adams the house was primarily entered from a temporary wooden piazza on the south. President Thomas Jefferson used the Entrance Hall as a \\"Cabinet of Natural History\\" displaying finds from the Lewis and Clark Expedition. In the 20th century the Entrance Hall has been used for official welcomes, receiving lines, small concerts, and dancing. Actor John Travolta danced with Diana, Princess of Wales in 1985; in 1998 First Lady Hillary Clinton danced here with Czech President V√°clav Havel. Furnishings On the west wall of the room is a gilded beech French Empire pier table (c. 1812) by cabinetmaker Pierre-Antoine Bellange purchased for the Blue Room by President James Monroe. On the pier table is an ormolu French Empire mantel clock featuring a sculpture of Minerva. This clock was manufactured by the bronzier Pierre-Philippe Thomire and also bought by Monroe, it was previously located in the Blue Room. In the southeast and southwest corners of the Entrance Hall are crimson and gold upholstered French Empire banquettes acquired by interior designer St√©phane Boudin of Maison Jansen during the John F. Kennedy administration. The McKim era bronze torch√®res remain in the room. A pair of Louis XVI torcheres flank the door leading to the North Portico. A pair of armchairs commissioned for the Blue Room in 1902 and based on a suite of chairs designed by Jacob-Desmalter in the Salon des Fleurs of the Ch√¢teau de Compi√®gne are placed on the North wall.

Primarily focused on the Fantastic Four, Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and the Hulk, it ran 22 issues before changing its name and page-count, becoming Marvel's Greatest Comics. Publication history One of several 68-page, 25-cent \\"giant-size\\" comic books that supplemented publishers' regular 36-page, 12-cent lines, Marvel Collectors' Item Classics premiered as an annual publication in 1965. That first issue, dated February 1965 in its postal indicia though not on the cover, reprinted The Fantastic Four #2 (Jan. 1962) and The Amazing Spider-Man #3 (July 1963), as well as the Ant-Man story from Tales to Astonish #36, and the first \\"Tales of Asgard\\" featurette, from Journey into Mystery #97 (Oct. 1963). It was a sister publication of what was then the annual, giant-size reprint comic Marvel Tales. \\"MCIC\\", as it was often abbreviated in Marvel Comics text pages, became a bimonthly series beginning with issue #2 (April 1966), which reprinted The Fantastic Four #3 (March 1962), The Amazing Spider-Man #4 (Sept. 1963), and the Ant-Man story from Tales to Astonish #37 (Nov. 1962). Rare new cover art, by Jack Kirby and John Verpoorten, on the reprint comic Marvel Collectors' Item Classics #19 (Feb. 1969) Dropping Spider-Man the following issue -- with that superhero's stories going on to anchor Marvel Tales -- the comic began reprinting what would be its regular line-up: The Fantastic Four, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man stories from Tales of Suspense, and Doctor Strange stories from Strange Tales. Six issues included short semi- anthological \\"Tales of the Watcher\\" science-fiction stories hosted by and sometimes featuring Uatu, the Watcher. The reprints were generally in serial order, with occasional skips; missing, for instance, are The Fantastic Four #5-6, already reprinted in Fantastic Four Annual #2-3 (1964‚Äì1965); #11, already partly reprinted in Annual #3; #12, never reprinted at the time; #19, reprinted in heavily edited form in the 1967 promotional one-shot America's Best TV Comics; and #25-26, reprinted in Fantastic Four Annual #4 (1966). The covers of issues #1-11 each reprinted two to four covers of the comics reprinted inside. Issues of The Incredible Hulk were not reprinted in full, but generally as chapters spread across two to three issues apiece. =Marvel's Greatest Comics= With issue #23 (Oct. 1969), the series changed its title and reduced its page-count to 52, exchanging its Hulk stories for shorter \\"Tales of the Watcher\\" vignettes. They and such incidentals as pin-ups were replaced by Captain America stories from Tales of Suspense in #25-28. Afterward, the comic reprinted two Fantastic Four stories each issue, usually with a Human Torch and Thing feature from Strange Tales, before becoming a standard 36-page comic with #35 (June 1972), reprinting Fantastic Four stories, at the then-regular price of 20 cents. The series ran through #96 (Jan. 1981), reprinting a truncated, 23-page version of the 34-page Fantastic Four #116.

The team's head football coach was Fielding H. Yost in his 18th season with the program. The 1918 team played in a season shortened by World War I travel restrictions and the 1918 flu pandemic. They shared the Big Ten Conference championship with Illinois and finished with a perfect record of 5‚Äì0, outscoring opponents 96 to 6. Although no formal mechanism existed in 1918 to select a national champion, the 1918 Michigan team was retroactively selected as the national champion by the Billingsley Report and a co-national champion with Pittsburgh by the National Championship Foundation. The Wolverines played their home games at Ferry Field. Fullback Frank Steketee was selected by Walter Camp as a first- team All-American and was one of the top kickers in the game during the 1918 season. Center Ernie Vick, and left tackle Angus Goetz were both selected as first-team All-Big Ten players. Schedule Preseason In 1918, the United States was embroiled in World War I. Many University of Michigan students, including athletes, were serving in the military. Team captain Tad Wieman did not play during the 1918 season as he had enlisted in the Aviation Corps. Halfback Eddie Usher was also taken into active military service after the first game of the season. Curtis Redden's letter from the front was published before the start of the 1918 season. Three former Michigan football players were killed in the war. One of the casualties was Curtis Redden, star end of Fielding Yost's \\"Point-a-Minute\\" teams. In April 1918, newspapers published a letter from Redden to a friend back home describing his unit's \\"baptism of fire\\": > \\"And so it went from day to day, but oftimes the nights were very bad. At > night, when the infantry launched its raids, or the enemy his, or the > infantry became nervous and called for help, the guns stamped like stallions > and snorted their breaths of fire. The blackness of the night became a > series of dots and dashes, until the world resembled a vast radio station, > spelling hell, hell, and hell again. To this must be added the shriek of > shells, the whistle of fragments, the automatic hammer effect of the machine > gun, the rattle of the rifle fire, the rockets and star shells out over No > Man's land‚Äîall combined to make the night weird, hideous, fascinating, > sublime.\\" The Michigan Alumnus published a letter from another Michigan athlete, Cecil F. Cross, recalling memories of football in Ann Arbor: > \\"The autumn is approaching here. The days are getting shorter and there is a > chill in the air ... It seems to bring back the old feeling which is > experienced where the smell of football is in the air, the first cold days > of autumn and it makes me homesick, though only slightly. Ralph Henning, of > Bay City, is here, and though we come from different parts of Michigan and > attended different schools, he being the captain of the Michigan Aggies' > football team in 1916, we quite frequently talk over the old scenes with > which we are both familiar. He, too, has mentioned the feeling of football > in the air. If they were to train an army of football players and throw them > into the lines, the last weeks of October, with Coach Yost to address them > just before the battle, we would score a touchdown the first half, and > before Thanksgiving we would have pushed the Germans under their own goal > posts and eat dinner in Berlin.\\" 1918 Michigan football team (full squad) on Ferry Field. Before the football season began, a rumor spread that football would be abandoned for 1918. The university decided to proceed with the football season, though war-time restrictions limited travel and practice time. To compensate for the players serving in the military, the existing prohibition on freshman players was lifted for the year. As originally adopted, Michigan's 1918 schedule included games against Cornell (at Ithaca), Northwestern (at Ann Arbor) and Minnesota (at Ann Arbor). Those games, and planned replacement games against Camp Custer and the University of Mount Union, were cancelled. Travel restrictions resulted in cancellation of the Cornell and Minnesota games, and the 1918 flu pandemic forced the cancellation or rescheduling of other games. After Cornell cancelled its game, Syracuse was put on the schedule in its place. Game summaries =Michigan 33, Case 0= Halfback Abe Cohn was \\"an eye opener\\" against Case, requiring \\"two or three men\\" to stop him. Michigan opened its season on October 7, 1918, with a home game against the Case Scientific School (now Case Western Reserve University) from Cleveland. Michigan came into the game with only two players (Angus Goetz and Abe Cohn) who had ever played for Michigan previously. Despite facing a Case team that returned seven letterman from 1917, head coach Fielding H. Yost expressed confidence in a pre-game interview: \\"I haven't had a scrimmage since Monday, but the team looks like it ought to go pretty good. Conditions are fair for a good game, and I expect one.\\" Michigan won easily by a score of 33‚Äì0, but the Detroit Free Press noted that the inexperienced team \\"played a ragged game,\\" albeit showing \\"promise of development into a smooth playing machine.\\" Cress, playing at center, was credited with playing \\"the best defensive game of any man on Ferry Field,\\" and John Perrin was reported to have made \\"a splendid showing.\\" The Detroit Free Press called Abe Cohn \\"an eye opener\\" as a ground gainer and noted: \\"He made a gain practically every time he was given the ball and, when he was stopped, it always took two or three men to turn the trick.\\" Edward Usher tore ligaments in his ankle while running with the ball and had to be taken out of the game. Freshman Frank Steketee entered the game as a substitute and made an impressive debut; he accounted for 21 points, \\"making three of the five touchdowns and kicking three out of five attempts at goal.\\" Michigan's starting line-up against Case, as announced the day before the game, was Fletcher (left end), Clash (left tackle), Goetz (left guard), Cress (center), Freeman (right guard), Lent (right tackle), Dunne (right end), Walker (quarterback), Cohn (right halfback), Perrin (left halfback) and Usher (fullback). =Michigan 13, Chicago 0= Angus Goetz blocked a punt and returned it 55 yards for a touchdown against Chicago. After its season opener against Case, the Michigan team was idle for more than a month as games with Camp Custer and Mt. Union College were cancelled, and the game against Michigan Agricultural College postponed, due to the influenza pandemic. On November 9, 1918, the team resumed play with a game against Amos Alonzo Stagg's Chicago Maroons at Stagg Field in Chicago. The two teams, which had been one another's principal rivals from 1890 to 1905, had not met for 13 years. In the prior meeting, Chicago had defeated Michigan 2‚Äì0, breaking a 56-game undefeated streak by the Wolverines. The game was played as negotiations were underway to end World War I, and the Chicago Daily Tribune wrote: \\"While the nations of the world are hoping for an armistice, the resumption of hostilities between forces guided by Gens. Yost and Stagg brought joy to thousands of football fans, and the opening battle attracted approximately 7,000 of them.\\" The game began at 2:30 pm Despite fumbles by Cohn and Knode early in the game, Michigan held on defense. After Knode's fumble, Chicago's Stegman attempted a dropkick from the 45-yard line, but Goetz broke through the Chicago line and blocked the kick. Goetz picked it up an returned it 55 yards for a touchdown. Steketee kicked the extra point, and Michigan led 7‚Äì0. The third quarter ended with Michigan driving deep in Chicago territory at the seven-yard line. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Perrin was stopped at the one-yard line on a run up the middle from a fake punt formation. On the next play, Perrin ran for the touchdown. Steketee missed the extra point, and Michigan led 13‚Äì0. Michigan's starting lineup was Dunne (left end), Goetz (left tackle), Adams (left guard), Vick (center), Freeman (right guard), Morrison (right tackle), Karpus (right end), Knode (quarterback), Perrin (left halfback), Cohn (right halfback) and Steketee (fullback). =Michigan 15, Syracuse 0= On November 16, 1918, five days after the signing of the Armistice marking the end of hostilities in Europe, Michigan defeated Syracuse 16‚Äì0. The game was played in pouring rain at Ferry Field. Both teams failed to score in the first quarter, as Michigan fullback Frank Steketee missed a field goal from the 25-yard line on one drive and Knode fumbled at the Syracuse five-yard line to end another drive. Cohn and Vick both intercepted passes in the second quarter. After Knode made a fair catch on a punt and Syracuse was penalized for offsides, Steketee kicked a field goal from the 36-yard line to give Michigan a 3‚Äì0 lead. Michigan's next possession mirrored its last, as the ball was placed on Syracuse's 35-yard line after a roughing penalty was called against Syracuse for interfering with Knode as he attempted a fair catch of a punt at the 40-yard line. Steketee kicked his second field goal from the spot to give Michigan a 6‚Äì0 lead at halftime. All-American fullback Frank Steketee scored all 15 points in Michigan's victory over Syracuse. In the third quarter, Steketee missed a field goal from the 32-yard line. In the fourth quarter, Vick and Knode both intercepted pass. Vick's interception stopped a Syracuse drive at Michigan's 15-yard line, and Knode's interception gave Michigan the ball at the Syracuse 21-yard line. After advancing the ball to the 14-yard line, Steketee added a third field goal to give Michigan a 9‚Äì0 lead. Later in the fourth quarter, Steketee intercepted a pass and returned it 20 yards for a touchdown. Steketee missed the extra point, and Michigan led 15‚Äì0. Steketee scored all 15 points in Michigan's win over Syracuse and received national media attention for his performance. In the Detroit Free Press, Harry Bullion wrote: \\"One man stood above all the rest in this sparkling triumph of the Wolverines. They'll be singing the praises of Steketee long after he trods the campus for the last time. All of the points assembled by Michigan are attributed to the educated toe and agility of Yost's brilliant fullback.\\" The Syracuse Herald reported: \\"One man stood out in the Michigan triumph, Steketee of Grand Rapids. He made the entire 15 points scored by his team and otherwise mussed up perfect good intentions on the part of the visitors.\\" The victory over Syracuse also enhanced Michigan's reputation, as Syracuse and Pittsburgh had been viewed as the most powerful teams in the East. The Michiganensian called the Syracuse game \\"the best contest of the year\\" against the strongest team in the East and noted: \\"From the very first moment of play to final blowing of the whistle, the contest was one of the prettiest exhibitions of football ability that has been seen on Ferry Field.\\" Michigan's starting lineup was Dunne (left end), Goetz (left tackle), Adams (left guard), Vick (center), Freeman (right guard), Young (right tackle), Morrison (right end), Knode (quarterback), Perrin (left halfback), Cohn (right halfback) and Steketee (fullback). =Michigan 21, Michigan Agricultural 6= 1918 M.A.C. program On November 23, 1918, Michigan played its fourth game against Michigan Agricultural College (now known as Michigan State University). The game was played at Ferry Field in front of the largest crowd of the season estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000. Followers of both schools attended in large numbers, \\"the maize and blue of Michigan and the green and white of M.A.C. decorating the stands the length and breadth of them.\\" The Aggies in 1918 had a new head coach, George Gauthier, and a highly touted African-American running back, Harry Graves. The Aggies had defeated Knute Rockne's Notre Dame the previous week in East Lansing. After a scoreless first quarter, Michigan scored two touchdowns in the second quarter. Right halfback Abe Cohn scored Michigan's first touchdown on a two-yard run. Left tackle Angus Goetz scored the second touchdown after Graves fumbled a forward pass. Goetz recovered the fumble and ran it back for a touchdown. Quarterback Knode scored Michigan's final touchdown in the third quarter on a 30-yard run after faking a pass. Steketee converted all three extra points. Michigan's line was given credit for stopping the Aggies' running attack. The Detroit Free Press reported that M.A.C.'s \\"vaunted stars\\", including Harry Graves (described as \\"the colored boy of whom so much was expected\\"), were unable to assert themselves. \\"Superiority of the Michigan line was the rock upon which the Aggies split. M.A.C. showed a fast backfield that might have created endless trouble, but it got little support from the forwards, who were cracked open to let the Wolverines surge through and flatten the runner.\\" The start of the game was delayed by lengthy pre-game ceremonies featuring the French Blue Devils, performances by the U. of M. army and navy bands and the M.A.C. bands, parades by the Students' Army Training Corps and Naval Units, and a fly-over by former Michigan football captain Pat Smith in his aeroplane. Because of the delay, the game was concluded in darkness. The Aggies took advantage of the darkness late in the game by unleashing a passing attack. The Aggies scored late in the game, \\"as the darkness already had begun to enshroud the playing field,\\" on a pass from Archer to Schwei. The Detroit Free Press reported: \\"But for the review of the service corps and the ceremonies attending there hardly would have been an Aggie score.\\" After the game, sports writer Harry Bullion wrote in the Detroit Free Press: \\"M.A.C.'s defeat is nothing for her to be ashamed of. It simply was a case of a better-conditioned and smarter eleven overpowering another that, though it lacked nothing in the way of fight that its enemy possessed, failed to cope with the superior knowledge of the game that was Michigan's by right of judgment and the attending conditions.\\" Michigan's starting lineup was Dunne (left end), Goetz (left tackle), Adams (left guard), Vick (center), Freeman (right guard), Fortune (right tackle), Boville (right end), Knode (quarterback), Cohn (left halfback), Perrin (right halfback) and Steketee (fullback). =Michigan 14, Ohio State 0= 1918 Ohio State program For its fifth game, Michigan traveled to Columbus to play Ohio State. The game presented an opportunity for Michigan to lay claim to the Big Ten Conference championship. Illinois had previously beaten Ohio State by a 13‚Äì0 margin, and Michigan supporters hoped that a greater margin of victory would allow the Wolverines to prove themselves superior to the Illini. Michigan did not achieve the large margin it had hoped for, but won the game 14‚Äì0, scoring one point more than Illinois. The game was played on a wet and slippery field that handicapped the offensive players. The Detroit Free Press reported that players had difficulty untracking themselves in \\"the mire that lay over the gridiron like custard.\\" The teams played to a scoreless tie in a first half that featured a punting duel between Steketee and Rife. Michigan's first touchdown was set up by a 73-yard punt from Steketee that \\"stuck fast in the mud\\" at Ohio State's two- or three-yard line. Michigan's defense held, and Rife was forced to punt from his end zone. In the outstanding play of the game, Goetz blocked the punt and recovered it in the end zone for a touchdown. The Detroit Free Press described the key play as follows: > \\"The pass from center was perfect and there seemed to be no fear that Rife > would not get it away. But Goetz, one man who has starred in every game the > Maize and Blue played this year, shattered the line and rammed the Buckeye > punter. Leather and Goetz collided and the pigskin went bounding away with > Goetz in hot pursuit. Three scarlet-robed athletes tried to block Goetz's > path to the ball, but he thrust them aside and went to earth with it just as > his rivals in the race catapulted themselves at the leather.\\" Later in the quarter, with the ball at Ohio State's 28-yard line, Steketee faked a run around the end and passed to Dunne who was \\"camped near the uprights.\\" Steketee kicked both extra points to give Michigan a 14‚Äì0 margin. Michigan had an earlier touchdown called back in the third quarter when the head linesman ruled that Knode had stepped out of bounds on a long run. Michigan's starting lineup was Dunne (left end), Goetz (left tackle), Fortune (left guard), Vick (center), Freeman (right guard), Czysz (right tackle), Bovill (right end), Knode (quarterback), Perrin (left halfback), Cohn (right halfback) and Steketee (fullback). Post season The team finished the season with a 5‚Äì0 record and outscored opponents 96 to 6, allowing only a single touchdown all season. Though Illinois had two non-conference losses, it finished with a 4‚Äì0 record in Big Ten play, resulting in a shared conference championship between Michigan and Illinois. Although no formal mechanism existed in 1918 to select a national champion, several organizations recognized by the NCAA have developed systems to identify \\"national champions\\" for past seasons. Two of those organizations, the Billingsley Report and the National Championship Foundation, selected Michigan as a national championship team for 1918. =Dispute over Big Ten championship= South Stand at Ferry Field, 1918 The 1918 season was Michigan's first season in the Big Ten Conference following its withdrawal in 1906. Due to the cancellation of games against Minnesota and Northwestern, Michigan played only two games against Big Ten opponents, Chicago and Ohio State. Illinois, which had lost a non- conference game, but finished 4‚Äì0 against Big Ten opponents, declined Michigan's invitation to meet in a post-season game to decide the championship. The Detroit Free Press chided Illinois for refusing the match: > \\"[Illinois athletic director] Huff's explanation was as humorous as it was > disappointing. He attempted to excuse Illinois on the grounds that the > weather in December would be too cold for a game and for that reason there > could be no meeting. ... the fact remains that it couldn't be too cold for > Michigan, whose players have the same number of arms and legs and a covering > of skin no thicker than the athletes who disport themselves under the colors > of the Illini.\\" Some sources refer to Illinois and Michigan as co-champions in 1918. However, at the time, the question of conference supremacy was contested. The following excerpt from Michigan's 1919 yearbook outlines the opposing arguments: \\"Eastern critics were of the opinion that the Maize and Blue team was rightfully entitled to claim the honors, but western writers held that since Illinois played four Conference games, all of which went to them, they should hold the honors. Despite the fact that they were beaten once by the Municipal Pier Service team of Chicago, and although Michigan had lost no games, the opinion of the western critics could not be changed.\\" =Honors= Fullback Frank Steketee, who scored all 15 points in Michigan's victory over Syracuse, was the only Michigan player selected as a first-team All-American. Left tackle Angus Goetz won All-Big Ten Conference honors after scoring touchdowns off fumble recoveries and a blocked punt against Chicago, Michigan Agricultural and Ohio State. Center Ernie Vick also won All-Big Ten honors and played so well on defense that Fielding Yost called him \\"a second [Germany] Schultz.\\" Quarterback Kenneth Knode, \\"though not a brilliant player individually,\\" was credited with piloting the team with \\"fine judgment.\\" Players =Letter winners= Photographs of Fred Hendershot, Abe Cohn and Chester Morrison from the 1919 Michiganensian.

Beginning as a pillow manufacturer, the company diversified and manufactured bedsheets under various brand names. The company was officially declared bankrupt on October 7, 2003. The company liquidated over the following nine years, including machinery and brands.  History  Pillowtext was established in 1954 in Dallas, Texas, as a pillow manufacturer. Over time, Pillowtex's range of products extended to bed sheets, and mattress protectors. The company made over 10,000 products and was an industry leader in manufacturing blankets, pillows, mattress pads, and comforters. At its peak, Pillowtex operated 16 manufacturing and distribution facilities and employed over 7,650 people. Its tradenames included Beacon Manufacturing, Bigelow- Sanford, Fieldcrest Cannon, Leshner Corp. and Wiscassett Mills. Pillowtex was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) as PTX. In September 1997, Pillowtex acquired the Fieldcrest-Cannon bedsheet company of Kannapolis, North Carolina for million in cash and stock. The acquisition tripled Pillowtex's sales. Pillowext spent a further $133 million to consolidate operations, update plants to lower manufacturing costs and implement new information technology systems. In 1998, Pillowtex bought The Leshner Corporation for about $75 million. By the third quarter of 1998 however, sales missed expectations, and earnings declined, continuing its slide into 1999. Pillowtex' share price dropped from $46 to $11. By the end of 1999, Pillowtex was heavily leveraged. It had long-term debt of $1.01 billion and equity of just $242 million. In November 2000, Pillowtex filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. At the time, annual sales were $1.4 billion. The company arranged for debtor-in-possession financing of $150 million from the Bank of America and other lenders. In May 2002, Pillowtex briefly surfaced from bankruptcy for little more than a year, but things kept sliding. On July 30, 2003, Pillowtex Corporation announced the complete bankruptcy of the company. Pillowtex filed a bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court on July 20, 2003. A Chapter 11 liquidating plan was confirmed, which created the Pillowtex Liquidating Trust. Overnight, 7,650 people were laid off (4,340 in its Kannapolis plant alone). This was the largest permanent layoff in the history of the state of North Carolina. The bankruptcy announcement also included an agreement for Pillowtex assets to be sold to GGST LLC, a joint venture of four liquidation companies (SB Capital Group, Gibbs International, Gordon Brothers Retail Partners and Tiger Capital Group), for $56 million, subject to bankruptcy court approval. According to a former CEO of Pillowtex, its largest product buyer, Walmart, encouraged the company to move production overseas [to remain competitive] but Pillowtex refused. It was undercut by competitors (producing overseas at lower prices) and when its prices were no longer competitive, the company no longer received orders from Walmart.The Age of Wal-Mart, CNBC television documentary, first aired late 2004. The UNITE textile workers union issued a statement blaming job layoffs on free-trade legislation, making American companies uncompetitive. On October 7, 2003, Pillowtex won approval from a bankruptcy court judge to sell company assets, including machinery and brands, to GGST LLC for $128 million. The brands \\"Cannon\\", \\"Royal Velvet\\", \\"Charisma\\", and \\"Fieldcrest\\" became the intellectual property of SB Capital.

Published from 1974 to 1985, this sequence of five interrelated novels explore the lives of a group of Europeans before, during, and after World War II. Durrell uses many of the experimental techniques of metafiction that he had integrated into his Alexandria Quartet, published 1957 to 1960. He described the later quintet as a quincunx. Monsieur is based on a metafictional narrative in five major sections, each with a competing narrator. The novel does not resolve which narrative is 'real' and which are 'fiction.' The novel was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1974. Background The novel draws extensively on Gnosticism, and this system of belief recurs as a plot element throughout the Quintet. Durrell had an interest in Gnosticism from the early 1940s and had studied Gnostic texts.Bowker, Gordon. Through the Dark Labyrinth: A Biography of Lawrence Durrell. New York: St Martin's Press, 1997, p. 164 According to critics James Gifford and Stephen Osadetz, for Monsieur, Durrell drew from Serge Hutin's Les Gnostiques, as he had marked numerous passages in his copy, as well as contemporary newspaper reports he held of a Slovenian suicide cult. These materials are held at the Bibliotheque Lawrence Durrell, Universit√© Paris X, Nanterre. Gifford and Osadetz say that \\"most critics\\" suggested that the author had based his discussion on Jacques Lacarri√®re's The Gnostics. He had known the essayist and critic since 1971, and wrote the \\"Foreword\\" to the 1974 English translation of his book... In Monsieur, \\"Durrell's Gnostics enact their refusal of the cursed world, flawed in every way, through suicide via the active acceptance of death.\\" But Lacarri√®re had written that \\"suicide is the absolute antithesis of the Gnostic attitude.\\"Jacques Lacarriere, The Gnostics, p. 38 The Gnostic suicide plot is an element that Durrell uses in his four late novels of the Avignon Quintet. Durrell's 1974 novel was published prior to the publication in English of the Nag Hammadi Library (1978). This was greeted with great interest by the many interested in these unique materials. The annotated edition has translations of an extensive stash of ancient documents from the period of early Christianity when Gnosticism was a powerful movement. The documents were discovered in the 1940s and had been tightly controlled by a group of scholars. The English edition of the Nag Hammadi papers refers to Durrell in its introduction, but largely in relation to his earlier The Alexandria Quartet (1957 to 1960). p. 543. Plot summary Five characters in Monsieur (including Durrell, referred to as \\"D,\\" of \\"Devil in the Details\\") claim to be the author of the book.J. D. Mersault, \\"The Prince Returns: In Defense of Lawrence Durrell\\", The American Reader, n.d.; accessed 14 October 2016 In the first section, \\"Outremer\\" (outre-mer, meaning overseas in French, and used to officially refer to former colonies that are now departments and territories of the metropole), protagonist Bruce Drexel is introduced, who is the chief narrator of the novel. (He shares certain characteristics with Durrell, such as working as a diplomat and press attach√©.) He is returning to Provence after learning of the suicide of his lover, a man who was his brother-in-law. Drexel's wife has been institutionalized for mental illness for some time. He revisits Avignon with his friend Toby, while attending to the necessary funeral arrangements. He reminisces about his life with Piers and Sylvie. He recalls rich winter scenes when the three were first in love, as well as a novel written about them by Robin Sutcliffe. Another character, Aubrey Blanford, is noted briefly as having recently published a novel and gained fame from it. The second chapter, \\"Macabru,\\" recounts Bruce, Piers, and Sylvie's journey into Egypt years earlier. There they meet Akkad, who initiates them into a Gnostic cult. Akkad takes them to Macabru, an oasis in the desert, to introduce them to the cult's rituals. They take an extended journey together on the Nile River in this section. (Durrell's second novel of the Quintet, Livia, has characters make a river journey on the Rhone). \\"Sutcliffe, or the Venetian Documents\\" presents a new narrator, Robin Sutcliffe, identified as a character in Blanford's novel. This appears to render the previous materials as fictional, unless this is another fiction. Sutcliffe has various misadventures in Venice and recalls his failed marriage to Pia, Bruce's sister. \\"Life with Toby\\" returns to Bruce and Toby in Avignon, discussing a theory about the Knights Templar. This returns to the Gnostic theme. This section is interrupted by another text in \\"The Green Notebook,\\" which returns to Sutcliffe. (Durrell initially wrote Monsieur in a green notebook. \\"The Green Notebook\\" in this novel consists largely of his unrevised notes from work that preceded this novel.) This section becomes highly fragmentary. \\"Dinner at Quartilla's\\" is the last section of the novel. It reintroduces author Aubrey Blanford, who claims to have written the entire novel, in which Sutcliffe is a character. He dines with his friend, the old Duchess Tu. But she is known to have been long dead. The novel ends with an Envoi; it provides a list of who begat whom throughout the novel, but without a final resolution. Reception Critics generally praised the novel. In this period, Durrell was highly respected for his experimental works, was a bestselling author, and celebrated in Great Britain. Monsieur won the 1974 James Tait Black Memorial Prize. Its complex structure and treatment of Gnosticism has stimulated much scholarly study. But the New York Times reviewer was critical, saying, \\"The writing seems hastily improvised...The writing often gives this odd impression of being translated badly. We hear of a \\"female stag\\" and \\"a magnificent marble fountain of filigreed workmanship.\\"J.D. O'HARA, \\"Review\\", New York Times, 2 February 1975; accessed 17 October 2016 He closed the article with \\"The \\"Monsieur\\" of the title is the devil: those interested in that subject should read Robertson Davies's fine novel \\"Fifth Business.\\" As for \\"Monsieur,\\" it is regrettable that Durrell's advisers should have allowed him to publish it in its present formlessness.\\" Notes External links *The International Lawrence Durrell Society, Official website of ILDS *The Literary Encyclopedia 1974 British novels Novel sequences Novels by Lawrence Durrell Faber and Faber books Novels with gay themes ","title":"Monsieur (novel)"},{"id":"14342770","text":"Gomphus flavipes a fossil of a G. tuberculatus of Brazil in the Naturhistorisches Museum (Vienna) Gomphus is a genus of clubtail dragonflies in the family Gomphidae.

History In 1936 Albert Hayman and Len Malaghan opened their first ice cream parlour in Manners Street, Wellington, New Zealand followed in the same year by a second milk bar in Wellington, and one in Dunedin. Tip Top Ice Cream Company was registered as a manufacturing company in 1936. By 1938 Tip Top was manufacturing its own ice cream and was successfully operating stores in the lower half of the North Island, and in Nelson and Blenheim. In May 1938 Tip Top Ice Cream Company Auckland Limited was incorporated into the growing ice cream business. Due to distribution difficulties and World War II, this was operated as a completely separate company to the Wellington Tip Top. In November 1962, Hayman and Malaghan opened the biggest and most technically advanced ice cream factory in the Southern Hemisphere, built at Mount Wellington, Auckland, New Zealand. The Tip Top factory included staff houses and of farm land overlooking the Southern Motorway and cost NZ$700,000. Prime Minister Keith Holyoake attended the opening ceremony. By 1964 the Company had expanded to such an extent that a parent company was formed, General Foods Corporation (NZ) Limited. It was rated as one of the soundest investments on the stock exchange and other companies were quick to note its potential. The Auckland Tip Top factory was originally a seasonal factory, which worked only to produce ice cream for the summer months. They sold for a shilling, and early innovations led to ice cream inventions like Topsy, Jelly Tip, FruJu and Ice Cream Sundaes, some of which are among New Zealand's iconic foods today. The overwhelming success of these products transformed the Mt Wellington site from a summer-centred seasonal factory into a 24-hour, 365-day operation. As demand grew over the years, 2 further plants were opened in Christchurch and Perth. The Christchurch factory was specially designed to meet the stringent export requirements of the Japanese market. Supermodel Rachel Hunter appeared for the first time on television in an advertisement for Tiptop Trumpet in the mid-1980s at 15 years of age. This advertisement was popular and helped the Tip Top brand grow even stronger in New Zealand whilst also helping to launch her career. In April 1997 Tip Top was purchased by a West Australian food processor, Peters & Browne‚Äôs Foods from Heinz Watties. This merger of Peters & Browne‚Äôs and Tip Top created the largest independent ice cream business in the Southern Hemisphere with combined sales of $550 million. On 18 June 2001 Tip Top Ice Cream became part of Fonterra Co-operative Group after Fonterra purchased the Peter and Browne‚Äôs Foods Business. In 2007 the Christchurch Factory was closed with all production moving to Auckland. In 2011 Tip Top celebrated its 75th Anniversary. In 2019 Fonterra sold Tip Top for $380 million to UK-based company Froneri, a joint venture owned by Nestl√© and PAI Partners.

This included 13 selected dairies (a New Zealand term for convenience store) selling 10 cent, 1 scoop cone ice creams for one day as a promotional activity. Usually the price for a 1 scoop cone of Tip Top ice cream at a dairy is $1‚Äì2 depending on where it is purchased. As Tip Top considered rail and bus commuters to be their first loyal customers, on 22 November 2006 at Britomart Transport Centre (Auckland‚Äôs New Central railway terminal) a Tracey Collins-designed ice cream tree took centre-stage on the rail platform. Many local schools took the train to the Britomart to view the displays about the history of Tip Top ice cream and see the ice cream tree. Also as part of Tip Top's celebration, the previously discontinued brand Joy Bar was giving a temporary reprieve. Tip Top today Tip Top produces around 41 million litres of ice cream a year, and Fonterra Brands (Tip Top) Ltd has around 400 employees. New Zealanders alone consume the equivalent of 1.9 million litres of milk in the form of Tip Top ice cream every year. Also, New Zealand's 4.4 million people population, consume around two million Jelly Tips every year. Tip Top Ice Cream is exported to Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, Australia, Indonesia and the Pacific Islands. Today, the three most sold bowl ice cream flavours are Vanilla, Hokey Pokey and Jelly Tip. The five most popular (by sales) Tip Top novelties are Choc Bar, Lemonade Popsicle, Memphis Meltdown Big Nuts, Jelly Tip and Pineapple FruJu. The oldest novelty ice cream still in production is the Eskimo Pie.

Biography  He was probably born in Cornwall in 1575. A Richard Carpenter was baptised at Phillack, Cornwall, on 16 February 1575[/6], son of Thomas Carpenter. It is not certain, however, that he and this Richard Carpenter were the same person. He matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, on 28 May 1592, and took his degrees of B.A. on 19 February 1596, B.D. 25 June 1611, and D.D. 10 February 1616‚Äì17. He was elected to a Cornish fellowship at his college on 30 June 1596, and retained it until 30 June 1606; under the advice of Thomas Holland, the Rector, he studied theology, and became noted as a preacher. In 1606 he was appointed by Sir Robert Chichester to the rectories of Sherwell and Loxhore, near Barnstaple, and it has been suggested that he was the Richard Carpenter who from 1601 to 1626 held the vicarage of Cullompton.

He died on 18 December 1627, and was buried in the chancel of Loxhore Church, where a monument was erected to his memory. Works Carpenter's literary productions were confined to theology. He was the author of: *A Sermon Preached at the Funeral Solemnities of Sir Arthur Ackland, 9 January 1612. *A Pastoral Charge at the Triennial Visitation of the Bishop of Exon. at Barnstaple, 1616. *Christ's Larum Bell of Love resounded, 1616. *The Conscionable Christian, three sermons preached before the judges of the circuit in 1620, London, 1623.

T-box genes encode transcription factors involved in the regulation of developmental processes. This gene is the human ortholog of mouse Tbx21/Tbet gene. Studies in mouse show that Tbx21 protein is a Th1 cell-specific transcription factor that controls the expression of the hallmark Th1 cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFNG).

Function  Lymphotoxin beta is a type II membrane protein of the TNF family. It anchors lymphotoxin- alpha to the cell surface through heterotrimer formation. The predominant form on the lymphocyte surface is the lymphotoxin-alpha 1/beta 2 complex (e.g. 1 molecule alpha/2 molecules beta) and this complex is the primary ligand for the lymphotoxin-beta receptor. The minor complex is lymphotoxin-alpha 2/beta 1. LTB is an inducer of the inflammatory response system and involved in normal development of lymphoid tissue.

Function  The PCM1 protein was originally identified by virtue of its distinct cell cycle-dependent association with the centrosome complex and microtubules. The protein appears to associate with the centrosome complex during the cell cycle. Dissociation occurs during mitosis when PCM1 is dispersed throughout the cell. Immunolabeling studies performed found that PCM1 was present in centriolar satellites and in electron dense granules between 70 and 100 nm in diameter. These were originally thought to be scattered only around the centrosomes, but further studies proved that PCM1 was also found throughout the cytoplasm. PCM1 was shown to be essential for cell division because PCM1 antibodies cause cell-cycle arrest when microinjected into fertilized murine eggs. Targeting of centrin, pericentrin and ninein was also dramatically reduced after PCM1 depletion using siRNA, overexpression of PCM1 deletion mutants and PCM1 antibody microinjection. As a result of this depletion, the radial organization of the microtubules was found to be disrupted, but did not appear to effect microtubule nucleation.  Structure  PCM1 has four known transcripts, the longest of which has 39 exons. The open reading frame of PCM1 encodes a protein of 2024 amino acids. The protein contains coiled coil regions between areas of low complexity as well as an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) / GTPase domain, a nuclear localization domain and a eukaryotic molybdopterin domain. The eukaryotic molybdopterin binding domain is currently found in only five other human genes, xanthine dehydrogenase, sulfite oxidase (mitochondrial precursor), aldehyde oxidase, erythropoietin receptor precursor and the ATPbinding cassette, sub-family A, member 2 (ABCA2).  Tissue distribution  PCM1 mRNA expression in the mouse brain has been found to be highest in the hippocampus. In humans it is expressed above the median level of central nervous system (CNS) expression in most parts of the brain. Clinical significance Mutations in the PCM1 gene have been shown to cause genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia. If an isoleucine amino acid change in PCM1 is inherited the risk of developing schizophrenia was found to be 68% in two independent samples from south England and Scotland. This means that it may now be possible to offer very limited genetic counselling to a small proportion of people with schizophrenia who are also carriers of this mutation. PCM1 forms a complex at the centrosome with disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) and Bardet-Biedl syndrome 4 protein (BBS4), which provides a link between aberrant PCM1 and the abnormal cortical development associated with the pathology of schizophrenia. Interactions PCM1 has been shown to interact with PCNT.

Setting off from Forster, New South Wales on 13 November 2007 in their custom- designed kayak Lot 41, the two-man expedition succeeded after previous attempts, including the fatal journey of Andrew McAuley, had been unsuccessful. They arrived at Ngamotu Beach, in New Plymouth, New Zealand on 13 January 2008. The expedition holds the world record for \\"the longest trans- oceanic expedition in a double kayak by two expeditioners\\". A significant aspect of this undertaking was the use of the internet to allow the public to track the progress of Lot 41 in real time, and message the crew. Photographs and podcasts from the crew were made available just hours after they had been transmitted from the craft. Team Jones and Castrission in October 2011 The crew of Lot 41 were James Castrission and Justin Jones, two Australians from Sydney, New South Wales. They attended school at Knox Grammar School together and later kayaked across Bass Strait, as well as being the first to paddle the length of the Murray River, a distance of .Crossing the Ditch - About Us In addition to the crew of the kayak, many others, both in Australia and New Zealand, helped in the preparation for the voyage as well as providing constant support from land. Design and construction of Lot 41 The kayak Lot 41 was designed for the trans-Tasman crossing by Rob Feloy, who had designed the kayak for Peter Bray's trans-Atlantic Crossing approximately six years earlier. The Lot 41 design includes two cockpits, a cabin at the stern of the craft, a large water tank and storage for over 60 days of food for the two kayakers. An array of solar panels was incorporated into the design in order to charge the batteries used to power communication systems, bilge pumps and a water desalination unit. The fibreglass kayak was built in Australia in 2005, and was fitted with support systems including emergency beacons, satellite phone, global tracking system, and GPS.

Their distance over land, which measures the actual path travelled by the kayak and not a straight line, was . One of the difficulties faced by Lot 41 were strong headwinds. These winds on their own would have made the crossing more difficult, however the design of the cabin at the stern of the kayak compounded the issue. When the winds blew from behind, the cabin presented a smooth, aerodynamic shape which reduced the tailwind advantage. In contrast, headwinds met a nearly vertical cabin entrance, which acted as a large sail fighting against the paddlers.

Born and bred in New Zealand, the thoroughbred destined to be Australia's wonder horse was known only as Lot 41 when he was sold at the 1928 National Yearling Sales near Wellington. Following his purchase by a Sydney trainer, the thoroughbred made the trans-Tasman crossing to Australia, where he became famous. Other Trans-Tasman Crossings * Rowing ** 1969. Anders Svedlund attempted a Crossing from New Zealand to Australia, however he was over-turned five days after leaving from Auckland's Manukau Harbour and returned to New Zealand.Quincey, C. (1977). Tasman Trespasser, page 202. Auckland: Hodder & Stoughton. ** 1977. Colin Quincey, an England-born New Zealander, made the first successful human-powered trans-Tasman crossing. He took 63 days 7 hours to row his Yorkshire Dory row-boat from Hokianga, New Zealand to Marcus Beach on the Sunshine Coast of Australia.Quincey, C. (1977). Tasman Trespasser, page 190. Auckland: Hodder & Stoughton. **2007. Four Australians, led by Steven Gates, departed from Hokianga, New Zealand on 29 November. They arrived in Sydney Harbour on 30 December at 8:15 am, having taken 31 days to make the crossing. **2010. Shaun Quincey completed the solo row from Australia to New Zealand in March 2010. Shaun is the son of Colin Quincey, who completed the reverse journey in 1977. **2018.

Function  This protein belongs to a family of proteins that are receptor associated proteins of the synapse. It contains a conserved cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site. It is believed to play some role in anchoring or stabilizing the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at synaptic sites. It may link the receptor to the underlying postsynaptic cytoskeleton, possibly by direct association with actin or spectrin. Two splice variants have been identified for this gene. Role in health and disease In the neuromuscular junction there is a vital pathway that maintains synaptic structure and results in the aggregation and localization of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) on the postsynaptic folds. This pathway consists of agrin, muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK protein), AChRs and the AChR-clustering protein rapsyn, encoded by RAPSN. Genetic mutations of the proteins in the neuromuscular junction are associated with Congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS). Postsynaptic defects are the most frequent cause of CMS and often result in abnormalities in the acetylcholine receptor. The vast majority of mutations causing CMS are found in the AChR subunits and rapsyn genes. The rapsyn protein interacts directly with the AChRs and plays a vital role in agrin-induced clustering of the AChR. Without rapsyn, functional synapses cannot be created as the folds do not form properly. Patients with CMS-related mutations of the rapsyn protein typically are either homozygous for N88K or heterozygous for N88K and a second mutation. The major effect of the mutation N88K in rapsyn is to reduce the stability of AChR clusters. The second mutation can be a determining factor in the severity of the disease. Studies have shown that most patients with CMS that have rapsyn mutations carry the common mutation N88K on at least one allele. However, research has revealed that there is a small population of patients who do not carry the N88K mutation on either of their alleles, but instead have different mutations of the RAPSN gene on both of their alleles. Two novel missense mutations that have been found are R164C and L283P and the result is a decrease in co-clustering of AChR with raspyn. A third mutation is the intronic base alteration IVS1-15C>A and it causes abnormal splicing of RAPSN RNA. These results show that diagnostic screening for CMS mutations of the RAPSN gene cannot be based exclusively on the detection of N88K mutations  Interactions  RAPSN has been shown to interact with KHDRBS1.

Biography =Early life and education= Born in New York City, the son of Mary and Walter Henning (his father spent 36 years as a New York City police detective), he was the oldest of six children. His younger brother is veteran college football and NFL coach Dan Henning. Henning graduated from St. Peter's College in Jersey City, New Jersey, and came to Boston in 1959 to get a Master's Degree at Boston University. =Career= John Henning with co-anchor Mary Richardson covering Boston's Jubilee 350 festivities celebrating Boston's birthday. While studying, he interned at WGBH-TV (channel 2), where among his duties, he covered sports. But his heart was in news and politics. After two years at WGBH, he spent eight months in the Army. In 1964, he was hired at what was then known as WNAC-TV (now WHDH- TV) as a street reporter. He also began covering local and national elections, something he would become known for. By 1965, WNAC promoted him to news anchor, and he did the 6pm and 11pm newscasts. It was during this time that he began to gain the reputation as a dependable, accurate and savvy reporter who knows how to separate spin from fact. Henning left WNAC-TV in 1968, going to work for the old WHDH-TV (now WCVB-TV), Channel 5. Henning remained at Channel 5 till April 1977, when he returned to the anchor desk at Channel 7. While his reporting continued to win him praise, the ratings at WNAC-TV did not go up, and he was taken off the anchor desk and reassigned to other duties. Not long after that, in late June 1981, he decided to resign. At that time, media critic Robert MacLean of the Boston Globe wrote that \\"It is acknowledged among his colleagues that Henning, a veteran Boston TV newsman, [is] perhaps one of the best street reporters in the history of Boston TV news...\\" Due to a non- compete clause in his contract, he remained off the air till January 1982, at which time he was hired by WBZ-TV (Channel 4) to anchor the noon news. Henning spent the rest of his career working for WBZ, winning a number of awards in the process. In 1994, he was able to report on the success of his brother Dan Henning, who was named the football coach at Boston College. Meanwhile, after many years of anchoring, John stepped down from anchoring the noon news in May 1995, and WBZ-TV made him their senior correspondent, with a specialty in local and national politics. The veteran reporter also covered the State House. Henning retired from full-time reporting in 2003, but continued to do commentary for WBZ-TV and WBZ Radio, where he teamed up with another political commentator, Jon Keller, to do a feature called \\"Eye on Politics.\\" =Death= Henning was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome, a condition in which the bone marrow does not produce enough blood cells, in November 2009. He underwent a bone marrow transplant, but it was unsuccessful. Henning died on July 7, 2010 at Massachusetts General Hospital from leukemia complications at the age of 73.

This protein is a type I membrane glycoprotein in the vacuolar protein sorting 10 protein (Vps10p) family of sorting receptors. While it is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues, sortilin is most abundant in the central nervous system. At the cellular level, sortilin functions in protein transport between the Golgi apparatus, endosome, lysosome, and plasma membrane, leading to its involvement in multiple biological processes such as glucose and lipid metabolism as well as neural development and cell death. Moreover, the function and role of sortilin is now emerging in several major human diseases such as atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease, Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, and cancer. The SORT1 gene also contains one of 27 loci associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease.  Structure  = Gene = The SORT1 gene resides on chromosome 1 at the band 1p13.3 and includes 23 exons. This gene encodes 2 isoforms through alternative splicing. = Protein = Sortilin is a member of the Vps10p sorting receptor family. Crystallization studies of the protein reveal that, when complexed with the ligand neurotensin, the Vps10 ectodomain of sortilin forms a ten-bladed beta- propeller structure with an inner tunnel that contains multiple ligand binding sites. To prevent premature ligand binding during its synthesis, the precursor protein of sortilin contains a 44-amino acid pro-peptide that serves as a chaperone for the Vps10p domain. In addition, two hydrophobic loops have been detected in this domain and act to anchor the protein in the cell membrane. Sortilin has also been shown to undergo a conformational change and form a protein dimer in acidic conditions similar to ones found in the endosome, indicating a double mechanism for low pH-induced ligand release and possibly signaling towards recycling of the receptor.  Function  In humans, sortilin is expressed over a wide range of cell types and tissues such as the brain, spinal cord, adrenal gland, thyroid, B-lymphocytes, adipocytes, skeletal muscle, and heart. As a sorting receptor on the cell surface and on the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi apparatus within the cell, sortilin is involved in the transport of a wide variety of intracellular proteins between the trans-Golgi network, endosome, lysosome, and secretory granules, as well as the plasma membrane. This molecular function enables sortilin to participate in various biological processes, including the transport of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane of fat and skeletal muscle cells in response to insulin. It also mediates the interaction between proNGF and the p75NTR:sortilin complex by acting as a co-receptor to signal cell death. The fine regulation of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by sortilin is required for both neuronal and tumor cell survival. Moreover, sortilin has been implicated in LDL-cholesterol metabolism, VLDL secretion, and PCSK9 secretion, and thus plays a role in the development of atherosclerotic lesions. Other processes involving sortilin include endocytosis, negative regulation of lipoprotein lipase activity, myotube differentiation, ossification, and regulation of gene expression.  Clinical significance  Given its function in facilitating lysosomal degradation or recycling of ligands in lipid metabolism and the neural system, sortilin likely plays an important role in the underlying mechanisms and pathophysiology of atherogenesis and coronary artery disease, as well as in neurological disorders. For example, sortilin has been identified as an important receptor for brain apolipoprotein E (APOE) metabolism, which is implicated in the underlying mechanisms of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. A significant role for sortilin has recently also been reported in the field of oncology, as it has been detected in several cancer cell lines. Notably, human cancerous epithelial cells exhibited increased levels of sortilin as compared to normal epithelial tissues. Furthermore, it appears that sortilin participates in the progression of breast cancer and contributes to tumor cell adhesion and invasion. = Clinical marker = In 2007, chromosome 1p13.3 was identified as a promising locus through a genome-wide approach in patients with coronary artery disease. Subsequently, accumulating evidence suggests that the SORT1 gene at the 1p13 locus is an important risk factor for coronary artery disease, which is attributed to lipid metabolism disorders. As the role of sortilin in lipid metabolism and the development of atherosclerosis has been established, a recent study further reported that increased release of soluble sortilin from platelets, measured as circulating sortilin, may be associated with in vivo platelet activation. This observation also indicates that sortilin has a potential application as a clinical biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis. Additionally, a multi-locus genetic risk score study, based on a combination of 27 loci including the SORT1 gene, identified individuals at increased risk for both incident and recurrent coronary artery disease events, as well as an enhanced clinical benefit from statin therapy. The study was based on a community cohort study (the Malmo Diet and Cancer study) and four additional randomized controlled trials of primary prevention cohorts (JUPITER and ASCOT) and secondary prevention cohorts (CARE and PROVE IT-TIMI 22).  Interactions  Sortilin has been shown to interact with GGA1 and GGA2. = Interactive Pathway Map = Sortilin participates in interactions within the trans-Golgi network vesicle budding and BDNF signaling pathways.

A local chief brought him birds to study, one of which was a hornbill that became a valued pet until killed by another pet - a large-spotted genet (Genetta tigrina). He also raised two grey parrots that became his constant companions and learnt to talk, as well as a turaco that regularly shared an early morning bath with him. Horsbrugh had an undoubted skill with and an understanding of wild birds. Boer War 1899 saw him back in England for only a short while before being drafted to South Africa to take part in the Boer War. He served mainly with Lord Methuen and was promoted to Captain on 1 April 1900. In May of that same year he came under fire from the Boer forces while fording the Rhenoster River. He was among the troops that relieved the town of Lindley and the 13th Yeomanry Battalion on 27 June 1900. For the next two years he was moved all over the country in a seemingly endless war. His duties took up much of his time and energy, so that he published no bird articles during this period. Just before the end of the war, he was invalided back to England, arriving on the hospital ship Nubia in March 1902. For his services he received the Queen's Medal with three clasps and the King's Medal with two clasps. Francolinus natalensisby Claude Gibney Finch-Davies from The Gamebirds and Waterfowl of South Africa Tour of the United States As part of his convalescence in 1902, Horsbrugh embarked on an extensive tour of the United States. He devoted a large amount of time to studying particularly gamebirds and waterfowl in their natural habitat. During his tour he met, courted and married Elizabeth Mitchell of Philadelphia. She was to prove a steadfast partner who shared a lasting interest in birds. Return to South Africa After a stay of two years in Kent, Horsbrugh was again sent to South Africa in 1905 to enforce the imperial peace. He was posted to Bloemfontein, where he and his wife were allocated an officer's house on top of Naval Hill. It was an idyllic location, teeming with birds. Horsbrugh built some large aviaries in the garden so as to acquire first-hand knowledge of their breeding and habits. In June 1905 his younger brother, C. B. Horsbrugh (1874‚Äì1952), joined them on Naval Hill, but soon took up employment with the Transvaal Museum in Pretoria under Dr. J. W. B. Gunning. Besides hunting together, the two brothers often made trips into the veld to study birds in their natural habitat. Return to England The Horsbrughs left for England in July 1906 on four months' leave, and took along a large number of live birds. On the train trip from Bloemfontein to Cape Town, Boyd Horsbrugh travelled in the guard's van to ensure the proper feeding and care of his charges. When C. B. Horsbrugh returned to England in 1907, he also took along a considerable collection of live South African birds, causing great excitement in the avicultural world.

Dough conditioners may include enzymes, yeast nutrients, mineral salts, oxidants and reductants, bleaching agents and emulsifiers. They are food additives combined with flour to improve baking functionality. Flour treatment agents are used to increase the speed of dough rising and to improve the strength and workability of the dough. While they are an important component of modern factory baking, some small-scale bakers reject them in favour of longer fermentation periods that produce greater depth of flavour. These agents are often sold as mixtures in a soy flour base, as only small amounts are required. Examples Examples of dough conditioners include ascorbic acid, distilled monoglycerides, citrate ester of monoglycerides, diglycerides, ammonium chloride, enzymes, diacetyl tartaric acid ester of monoglycerides or DATEM, potassium bromate, calcium salts such as calcium iodate, L-cystine, L-cysteine HCl, glycerol monostearate, azodicarbonamide, sodium stearoyl lactylate, sucrose palmitate or sucrose ester, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate or polysorbate, soybean lecithin, and soybean lecithin enriched with lysophospholipids. Less processed dough conditioners include sprouted- or malted-grain flours, soy, milk, wheat germ, eggs, potatoes, gluten, yeast, and extra kneading. Malted, diastatic flours are not typically added by manufacturers to whole-wheat flours. Robertson et al. point out that some of the better information is found in baking books published back when bakers were still kneading by hand. See also article: Laurel's Kitchen. History In the early 1900s it was discovered the use of calcium chloride, ammonium sulfate, and potassium bromate halved the amount of yeast needed to raise dough. These mixtures were generally known as mineral yeast foods or yeast nutrient salts. After they became popular among bakers, one patented yeast food was analyzed by Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station chief chemist J.P. Street who published in 1917 that it contained, \\"calcium sulphate, 25; ammonium chlorid, 9.7; potassium bromate, 0.3; sodium chlorid, 25; patent wheat flour, 40.\\" They contain water conditioners, yeast conditioners, and dough conditioners. Yeast nutrients Yeast requires water, carbon sources such as starch and simple carbohydrates, nitrogen preferably as ammonium as it cannot assimilate nitrate, sulfur, phosphorus (often as inorganic phosphate), and minute quantities of vitamins and elemental mineral ions including B, Ca, Co, Cu, Fe, K, Mo, Mn, Mg, Ni, and Zn. Ammonium chloride, ammonium sulfate, or ammonium phosphate may be used as sources of nitrogen. Phosphoric acid, an acidulant, is used as a yeast stimulant. Calcium iodate, an oxidant, is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration generally recognized as safe or GRAS source of calcium. Oxidants and reductants Oxidizing agents are added to flour to help with gluten development. They may or may not also act as bleaching agents. Originally flour was naturally aged through exposure to the atmosphere. Oxidizing agents primarily affect sulfur-containing amino acids, ultimately helping to form disulfide bridges between the gluten molecules. The addition of these agents to flour will create a stronger dough.Hui and Corke 2006, p. 233. Dehydroascorbic acid and potassium bromate are oxidants, acting on sulfhydryl groups and disulfide bonds in wheat dough, in particular oxidizing glutathione. Potassium bromate acts more directly or with fewer chemical conversion steps than ascorbic acid. Glutathione increases wheat dough's extensibility, or relaxes it, while oxidizing a dough's glutathione increases elasticity. Common oxidizing agents are: * ascorbic acid (Ascorbic acid converts into its oxidizing form, dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA) during mixing.) * azodicarbonamide (E927) * potassium bromate (E924, the component which gives bromated flour its name, used mainly in the U.S. East and Midwest, acts as a bleaching agent, banned in some areas) * potassium iodate Reducing agents help to weaken the flour by breaking the protein network. This will help with various aspects of handling a strong dough. The benefits of adding these agents are reduced mixing time, reduced dough elasticity, reduced proofing time, and improved machinability. Cysteine and bisulfite are reducing agents which relax wheat dough. Adding minute amounts of oxidants or reducing agents alter the post-mix handling characteristics of dough. Common reducing agents are: * L-cysteine (E920, E921; quantities in the tens of ppm range help soften the dough and thus reduce processing time) * fumaric acid * sodium bisulfite * non-leavening yeast (ruptured cells) Emulsifiers Lecithin, monoglycerides, diglycerides, and DATEM are considered emulsifiers. They disperse fat more evenly throughout the dough, helping it to trap more of the CO2 produced by yeast. Lecithin added at a rate of 0.25-to-0.6% of the flour weight acts as a dough conditioner. Based on total weight, egg yolk contains about 9% lecithin. Monoglycerides and diglycerides replace eggs in baked goods. Emulsifiers tend to produce a finer grain, softer crumb, and with longer proof times, increased baked volume. Enzymes Enzymes are also used to improve processing characteristics. Yeast naturally produces both amylases and proteinases, but additional quantities may be added to produce faster and more complete reactions. *Amylases break down the starch in flours into simple sugars, thereby letting yeast ferment quickly. Malt is a natural source of amylase. *Proteases improve extensibility of the dough by degrading some of the gluten. *Lipoxygenases oxidize the flour. Other agents Other additives may be used as yeast nutrients or as a source of enzymes: * carbamide (also known as urea) (E927b) * phosphates * malted barley See also *Chorleywood bread process Notes References Bibliography *Hui Y and Cork H (2006).

Company history Mainland Products Ltd was founded in 1954 by Peter McConnon. It grew rapidly, encompassing fresh and processed milk, cheese (with which the company's name is most associated today) as well as ice cream (Tip Top), processed meats (Kiwi Huttons) and other consumer foods. Kiwi Co- operative Dairies led by CEO Craig Norgate acquired 83% of the business in the 1990s. The balance was acquired by Fonterra (formed by a 2001 merger which included Kiwi Co-op), also led by Norgate, in 2002. In 2005, Fonterra sold most of the business that was formerly part of Mainland to Graeme Hart's Rank Group Ltd but it retained all the cheese assets. Mainland cheese now comes under Fonterra Brands. The balance of the former Mainland company is now part of Goodman Fielder. Mainland remained a family owned and operated business with Peter's sons Baird and Alan along with grandson Simon McConnon until its sale to Fonterra.

Often referred to by its acronym, IVI-IPO, has roots dating to 1944, when the Independent Voters of Illinois was founded. In 1979 the IVI merged with the Independent Precinct Organization- IPO was founded by Dick Simpson a few years earlier and had worked to elect him Alderman of the 44th Ward as well as other independent candidates. IPO was founded to support the best candidate for a political position regardless of party affiliation and to effect political and community change through grass roots organizing. Both organizations were and are nonpartisan. IVI states that it is \\"dedicated to good government activism and an idealistic vision of open, honest government in Illinois through pragmatic means that confront cynicism and corruption with equal force.\\" The organization is organized into geographical \\"chapters\\" and, while technically a statewide organization, is concentrated in the Chicago area. IVI-IPO works on voter registration drives, provides voter information, and supports endorsed candidates. It endorses through a detailed questionnaire to candidates for office, followed by endorsement session vote of the \\"chapter,\\" followed in some cases, such as larger offices, by a vote of the board of directors. The organization then typically prints and widely distributes, through newsprint flyers and often print media advertisement, a list of its endorsements, with explanations for voters. As the name indicates, the organization at one time attempted to build a precinct organization that was independent of the political parties. By and large, the organization no longer conducts precinct work. The organization also acts as a lobbyist, primarily in the Illinois state legislature, on behalf of governmental reform issues. Its adopted positions are generally liberal, and in recent years the organization, more often than not, endorses Democrats. It also endorses in primary races. The IVI-IPO supported Harold Washington in the Illinois House of Representatives and as Mayor of Chicago during the 1980s \\"Council Wars.\\" On January 13, 1996 the IVI-IPO endorsed community organizer Barack Obama early in his first attempt at elected office, his first run for the Illinois Senate.

Overview De casibus is an encyclopedia of historical biography and a part of the classical tradition of historiography. It deals with the fortunes and calamities of famous people starting with the biblical Adam, going to mythological and ancient people, then to people of Boccaccio's own time in the fourteenth century.History of Tragedy The work was so successful it spawned what has been referred to as the De casibus tradition,Narrative, Authority, and Power: The Medieval Exemplum and the Chaucerian by Larry Scanlon, p. 119, Cambridge University Press (1994), influencing many other famous authors such as Geoffrey Chaucer, John Lydgate, and Laurent de Premierfait.Alan Coates, et al., A Catalogue of Books Printed in the Fifteenth Century now in the Bodleian Library (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 596-617.

Vittore Branca, 12 volumes I Classici Mondadori (Milan:Arnoldo Mondadori editor, 1983) Development Boccaccio wrote the core of his work from about 1355 to 1360 with revisions and modifications up to 1374. For almost four hundred years this work was the better known of his material. The forceful written periodic Latin work was far more widely read then the now famous vernacular Tuscan/Italian tales of Decameron.Louis Brewer Hall, \\"Introduction,\\" De casibus illustrium virorum (Gainesville: Scholars' Facsimiles & Reprints, 1962), v. The Renaissance period saw the secular biography development which was spearheaded partly by the success of this work being a stimulus and driving force of the new biography-moral genre. Purpose Boccaccio's perspective focuses on the disastro awaiting all who are too favoured by luck and on the inevitable catastrophes awaiting those with great fortune.De casibus virorum illustrium (work by Boccaccio) -- Britannica He offers a moral commentary on overcoming misfortune by adhering to virtue through a moral God's world. Here the monastic chronicle tradition combines with the classical ideas of Senecan tragedy. Content De casibus stems from the tradition of exemplary literature works about famous people. It showed with the lives of these people that it was not only biographies, but also snapshots of their moral virtues.Medieval France: An Encyclopedia By William W. Kibler, p. 129, Routledge Publisher (1995), Paris, Boccaccio relates biographies of famous people who were at the height of happiness and fell to misfortune when they least expected it.

History The term terukkuttu is derived from the Tamil words Teru (\\"street\\") and Kuttu (\\"theatre\\"). The word \\"Kattaikkuttu\\" is derived from the name of special ornaments known as kattai (or kattai camankal). The writer M. Shanmugam Pillai has compared terukkuttu to the Tamil epic Silappatikaram, calling Silappatikaram a proto-form of terukkuttu. The Silappatikaram story is still performed by the terukkuttu actors, the terukkuttu drama commences and ends in a manner similar to the commencement and end of each canto in the epic, and the actors sing and converse in verse interspersed with prose, the prose coming after the verse as its explanation. Both Silappatikaram and terukkuttu are centered around the chastity and moral power of women as cherished values. However, historically, the terukkuttu is not more than two to three centuries old. The researcher Richard A. Frasca wrote that certain of his performer-informants believed that the terukkuttu originally emanated from the Gingee area. It spread from South India to Sri Lanka, and became popular in Jaffna and Batticaloa. The early Sinhala Nadagam (open-air drama) closely followed Terukuttu plays in presentation and in style. The Jesuit priests in Jaffna also presented Catholic plays from the Portuguese tradition in Terukuttu style. Many scholars note the similarity between terukkuttu and other neighbouring regional drama forms, such as Yakshagana and Kathakali. However, unlike Kathakali, terukkuttu is less codified, and is generally considered a folk art rather than a classical art form. In recent times, some terukkuttu groups have also started operating as professional troupes. Theme Many terukuttu performances center around the enactment of Mahabharata story, with emphasis on the role of Draupadi. Terukkuttu plays on Ramayana are performed at Mariyamman festivals, and some of the plays also involve local deities. The terukkuttu plays form part of ritual celebrations including the twenty-one day temple festival starting in Chittirai, the first month of the Tamil calendar. The terukkuttu performances begin in the middle of the festival, and continue till the morning of the penultimate day. The core themes of the terukuttu plays include: * Draupadi Kalyanam (The marriage of Draupadi) * Supattirai Kalyanam (The marriage of Subhadra) * Alli Arjunan (The Marriage of Arjuna with Alli) * Pancal Capatam (The Vow of Draupadi) * Arjunan Tapam (Arjuna's tapas) * Krishnan Titu (The mission of Krishna) * Abhimanyu Cantai (The defeat of Abhimanyu) * Karna Mokshayam (The defeat of Karna) * Patinettam Por (The Battle of the Eighteenth Day) * Aravan kalappali (\\"Sacrifice of Aravan in the Battlefield\\") Symbol of sacrifice: Online edition of The Hindu, 17 August 2001 Style The terukkuttu plays are a combination of song, music, dance and drama along with \\"clever stage tricks\\". The actors wear colorful costumes. The musical instruments used by the terukkuttu musicians include harmonium, drums, a mukhavinai (an instrument similar to oboe), and cymbals. An acting arena is marked at courtyard of a temple, open ground or any other convenient site and people squat on the three sides of the rectangular arena. The chorus of singers and the musicians occupy the place on the rear side of the stage, and the actors use the front side. Two persons holding a curtain enter the arena, with an actor in the guise of Ganesha, the elephant-headed Hindu god. The chorus begins an invocation to Ganesha, and prayers are also offered to many other deities. The actor playing Ganesha now moves out of the arena, and Kattiyakkaran (jester and sutradhara i.e. the narrator) appears on the stage. Kattiyakkaran relates the story of the play to be performed and introduces the characters. Sometimes, the characters introduce themselves. Kattiyakkaran links the scenes, provides context to the happenings on the stage and also jests in between the scenes. The actors sing themselves, supported by the chorus. The text of a terukkuttu play is a series of songs related by a theme. Each song is rendered in a raga, structured in form of a classical song. It is preceded by viruttam, chanting of four-line verses in the same raga as the song. After the song, an actor delivers a speech based on it. The French theater group, Th√©√¢tre du Soleil, used elements of Terukuttu, including the two stories The Vow of Draupadi, and The defeat of Karna in their play, A Room in India.

The performers ‚Äì by tradition only men - sing, act and dance and the musicians accompany them on the harmonium, the mridangam and the mukavinai. The terms Terukkuttu and Kattaikkuttu are often used interchangeably. However, historically the two terms appear to have distinguished, at least in certain villages, between two different kinds of performance: while Terukkuttu referred to mobile performances by two actors participating in a procession for the village deity Mariamman, Kattaikkuttu denotes overnight, narrative performances at a fixed performance space acted by an ensemble of about fifteen actors and musicians. History Kattaikkuttu derives its name from the word kattai, which refers to the special ornaments worn by the actors during performances; kuttu refers to theatre. The audience recognizes the various characters by the shapes of their head wear and their make-up. Kattaikkuttu has been performed in rural Tamil Nadu for years. In November 1990, a group of seventeen rural actors and musicians founded, on the initiative of Kattaikkuttu actor Perungattur P. Rajagopal, an organization to promote their theatre in the town of Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu. They called this grassroots collective the Tamil Nadu Kattaikkuttu Kalai Valarcci Munnerra Sangam using the name of Kattaikkuttu rather than one of the current terms of Kuttu or Terukkuttu. The main objectives of the Sangam ‚Äì an officially registered society - were to promote Kattaikkuttu as a theatre form in its own right and to further the interests of professional performers. Since its inception more than twenty years ago, the Sangam has developed into an umbrella organization with a number of activities including educating and training a future generation of young, talented Kattaikkuttu performers (the Kattaikkuttu Gurukulam), opening up the theatre to rural girls and women, organization of an annual theatre festival and production of new and often innovative plays. In 2009 the organization shortened its name into Kattaikkuttu Sangam. Repertory Many traditional performances center on the enactment of parts of the Mahabharata; a few plays have Purana stories as their theme. To cater to a renewed interest in the theatre from urban audiences and cultural institutions, new plays of shorter and all-night duration have also been created. These plays have been successfully performed in Indian metros and abroad and have been assimilated into the repertory of the Kattaikkuttu Gurukulam‚Äôs Young Professionals Company. A few of the core plays of the traditional Kattaikkuttu repertory are: * The Bending of the Bow or Draupadi‚Äôs Marriage * Subhadra‚Äôs Marriage * The Royal Sacrifice * The Disrobing of Draupadi * Arjuna‚Äôs Penance * Kichaka‚Äôs Battle * Krishna‚Äôs Embassy * Karna Moksham *The Eighteenth Day (featuring Duryodhana‚Äôs death on the battlefield of Kurukshetra) *Dakshya‚Äôs Sacrifice *HiranyaVilasam Kattaikkuttu is usually performed in a religious setting and performances take place overnight: they start around 10pm and run until 6am the next morning. The occasions for Kattaikkuttu performances can be divided into the following categories: #Paratam (Mahabharata) festivals in honor of the Goddess #Other village festivals such as those for Mariyamman, Ankalamman, Shiva and Vishnu #Rites of individuals such as death rites #Secular occasions e.g. cultural festivals The Kattaikkuttu Gurukulam is regularly visited by prominent scholars in the theatre world--for example, Bennington College professor Sue Rees regularly visits the school to produce short videos and documentaries which feature various Kattaikkuttu works. Style Kattaikkuttu derives its name from the fact that a specific category of actors wear the so-called kattai or kattai samankal. Kattai are wooden head, shoulder and the breast ornaments inlaid with mirror work. The kattai represent power, heroic qualities and royalty. The kattai-wearers represent superhuman ‚Äì divine or demonic ‚Äì warriors who are the main agents in the mythological battles around which the performances are built. The acting arena is an open rectangular ground and the audience sits on three sides of the ground. The singers and the instrument players occupy the rear of the stage. The play begins with a musical introduction and songs in praise to several different deities. The first character to appear on stage is the clown or Kattiyakkaran (literally Praise Maker). The Kattiyakkaran is central to Kattaikkuttu performances: he provides entertainment, serves as the guardian of and opposite number for the principal characters and translates events from the epic and Puranic stories into everyday life experiences of the rural audiences. After his comic introduction, the Kattiyakkaran announces the title of the play to be performed and the entry of one of the principal characters. The stage entry of most kattai characters takes place behind a curtain held across the stage by two assistant performers. Such a curtain entry requires the actor to perform a prescribed routine of songs and dance. All Kattaikkuttu actors sing themselves, supported by the chorus. T.N. Krishna with kattaikoothu performance at Kochi muzirix Biennale 2018 About the Gurukulam The Kattaikkuttu Gurukulam was founded in October 2002 by actor, playwright, and director P. Rajagopal and Dr. Hanne M. de Bruin to preserve and enhance the scope of the Kattaikkuttu theatre and safeguard the artistic and economic position of its future exponents. The students are marginalized, young rural people between 5 and 20 years with a keen interest in the theatre form. Located 8 kilometers away from Kanchipuram in a small village called Punjarasantankal, the Kattaikkuttu Gurukulam follows the guru-shishya system of transmission. This means that students and teachers are in constant close contact with each other in formal and non-formal settings. The Gurukulam's students are tutored in life and in all aspects of the Perungattur style of Kattaikkuttu apart from receiving a formal education. The Kattaikkuttu Gurukulam came under the auspices of the Kattaikkuttu Sangam. It ran its own theatre company, the Kattaikkuttu Young Professionals consisting of senior students and graduates of the Gurukulam. The girl students of the Kattaikkuttu Gurukulam have their own ensemble, the Kattaikkuttu All-Girls Company, which serves as a laboratory to experiment with gender-sensitive issues. After 18 years since its inception, the Gurukulam was shut down in March of 2020, with a vision to becoming an indigenous Kattaikkuttu Knowledge Centre. The Knowledge Centre will reach out to a wider and more diverse audience, facilitating the sharing of artistic knowledge between different art forms.

The son of Bartolomeo da Vinci, Leonardo‚Äôs younger brother, Pierino demonstrated artistic ability at an early age; and was seen by his family as the heir to his uncle's talent. He studied under both Baccio Bandinelli (1488‚Äì1560) and Niccol√≤ Tribolo (1500‚Äì1550). Pierino died from malarial fever at the age of 23, in Pisa, in 1553-4. The biographical information about this artist comes almost exclusively from Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects by Giorgio Vasari; this history of art and artists reports a mixture of fact and legend, making it difficult to establish reliable historical information about the subject, in the absence of other sources. A relief that was admired by Vasari and was long thought to be by Michelangelo was recently the subject of an unsuccessful effort to keep it in the United Kingdom when it came up for auction. According to Vasari the relief was made by Pierino in 1549 for Luca Martini dell‚ÄôAla (c. 1500‚Äì1561), who was then in Pisa in the service of Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. It depicts Ugolino and his sons.The relief was brought to England by the painter Henry Trench (c. 1685-1726) before 1719 and only recently were the Martini arms found on the back on website for UK department of culture The work is now in the collection of the Liechtenstein Museum.Relief of Ugolino and his sons on Liechtenstein museum website Several sculptures, now believed to be by Pierino da Vinci, were at one time attributed to Michelangelo.

Flanders' chapter in the Proceedings is titled \\"Automatic differentiation of composite functions\\". He presented an algorithm inputting two n-vectors of (higher) derivatives of F and G at a point, which used the chain rule to construct a linear transformation producing the derivative of the composite F o G.

Differential forms Flanders is known for advancing an approach to multivariate calculus that is independent of coordinates through treatment of differential forms. According to Shiing- Shen Chern, \\"an affine connection on a differentiable manifold gives rise to covariant differentiations of tensor fields.

The screenplay by John Dighton is based on the Charles Dickens novel The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby (1839). This first sound screen adaptation of the book followed silent films released in 1903 and 1912. Plot After the patriarch of the family dies and leaves them with no source of income, Nicholas Nickleby, his mother, and his younger sister Kate venture to London to seek help from their wealthy, cold-hearted uncle Ralph, an investor who arranges for Nicholas to be hired as a tutor at Dotheboys Hall in Yorkshire and finds Kate work as a seamstress. Nicholas meets Mr. Squeers just as he concludes business with Mr. Snawley, who is \\"boarding\\" his two unwanted stepsons. Nicholas is horrified to discover his employers, the sadistic Mr. and Mrs. Squeers, run their boarding school like a prison and physically, verbally, and emotionally abuse their young charges on a regular basis. He eventually rebels and escapes, taking with him young crippled Smike. Nicholas and Smike take lodgings with Newman Noggs. Nicholas endeavours to find a position, but rejects a low-paying position as a politician's secretary, and a job as a tutor of the French for the Kenwig daughters comes to comic disaster. He and Smike decide to search for work elsewhere. As they are leaving the city, they make the acquaintance of Madeline Bray, the sole support of her father, who gambled away his fortune and now is indebted to Nicholas's uncle. In search of food and lodging, they stop at an inn, and the proprietor introduces them to actor-manager Vincent Crummles, who owns and operates a travelling theatrical troupe with his wife. Crummles hires them as actors and casts them in a production of Romeo and Juliet. Despite its success, Nicholas decides to return to London when he receives a letter from his uncle's clerk, Newman Noggs, who urges him to come back as quickly as possible, as his uncle has put his sister in great jeopardy despite a promise by him to make certain they come to no harm. Kate has been subjected to unwanted attention from Sir Mulberry Hawk and Lord Verisopht, clients of her uncle, and when Nicholas overhears them bawdily discussing her in a tavern he is determined to defend his sister's honour. The cowardly Hawk refuses Nicholas's demand to \\"step outside\\" and flees, resulting in a carriage accident in which Hawk is injured. Hawk and Lord Verisopht argue over Hawk's lack of honour, and Hawk kills Lord Verisopht in a duel with pistols. Ralph Nickleby loses 6000 pounds in debt owed him, much to the delight of Noggs, who harbours a hidden desire for revenge against his employer. Nicholas finds employment as a clerk with the benevolent Cheerybles, portly twin brothers whose nephew Frank begins to court Kate. They provide him a cottage in which Nicholas can place his family and Smike, who has been accepted warmly by all. Meanwhile, Squeers returns to London, planning to capture Smike and bring him back to Dotheboys Hall, and is engaged by Ralph Nickleby to stalk Nicholas and Smike. Squeers and Mr. Snawley make off with Smike \\"on the wishes of his father\\". Nicholas, aided by Noggs, intercepts them and foils the plot. Smike, severely beaten by Squeers, is nursed by Kate and falls in love with her. Nicholas meets Madeline a third time when the Cheerybles assign Nicholas to help her situation in secrecy from her father. His uncle has been trying to coerce her father into giving Ralph her hand in marriage in exchange for settlement of his debt, and Mr. Bray finally accedes. Noggs warns Nicholas, who arrives at the Bray lodgings to find Madeline, unhappily dressed in a wedding gown, awaiting her fate. In a showdown with Ralph, they discover her father dead in his bedroom after Kate reveals to Madeline the true nature of Ralph Nickleby's character. Madeline faints and Nicholas carries her away, warning Ralph to leave her alone as she is now free of all obligations. Ralph's hatred of Nicholas makes him determined to ruin him, but he is brought up short by Noggs, who has realized from the facts told him by Nicholas that Smike is actually Ralph's son, whom Ralph had Noggs take to Dotheboys. Ralph's hold over Noggs has compelled him to harbour the secret for fifteen years. Smike was sent to the Squeers after his mother's death, using a forged birth certificate, so that Ralph could keep her inheritance rather than let their child have it, as dictated by law. Further, Squeers hired Snawley to act the part of Smike's father to make his kidnapping appear legal. Noggs delights in telling Ralph that Squeers has confessed the conspiracy to the authorities, and Ralph now faces prison and financial ruin. Smike, fallen into hopelessless because Kate is in love with Frank, succumbs to his various ailments and dies just before Ralph arrives at Smike's deathbed. The police come to Ralph's house to arrest him. Ralph flees to his garret and hangs himself. True love prevails, and Nicholas and Madeline and Kate and Frank are wed.

There are just no two ways about it; the story of Nicholas Nickleby ‚Äî at least, in screen translation ‚Äî is a good whole cut below that of Great Expectations and its tension is nowhere near as well sustained . . . No doubt, the compression of details and incidents compelled by John Dighton's script put Director Cavalcanti on a somewhat unenviable spot, which is evidenced by his failure to get real pace or tension in the film's last half. And this overabundance also hampers the rounding of characters . . . Withal, Nicholas Nickleby is amusing as a chromo of Dickensian life. It is only that Great Expectations has led us to expect so much more\\".New York Times review Reviewing a revival, Time Out London observed, \\"For a director who dabbled in the avant-garde, Cavalcanti makes surprisingly little of the surreal possibilities of this convoluted Dickensian nightmare. As in Champagne Charlie he collaborated with art director Michael Relph to create an impressively atmospheric Victorian London, but stylish visuals hardly compensate for the flat, cursory rendering of some of Dickens' best drawn characters. Only Cedric Hardwicke as wicked Uncle Ralph and Bernard Miles as Noggs are given enough space to establish a proper presence. Meagre and one-dimensional, the film is finally smothered by Ealing's cosy sentimentality\\".Time Out London review =Box Office= According to trade papers, the film was a \\"notable box office attraction\\" at British cinemas in 1947.Robert Murphy, Realism and Tinsel: Cinema and Society in Britain 1939-48 2003 p209 References External links Review of film at Variety 1947 films 1947 drama films British black-and-white films British films Ealing Studios films Films based on Nicholas Nickleby Films directed by Alberto Cavalcanti Films produced by Michael Balcon Films set in London British drama films ","title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby (1947 film)"},{"id":"14343627","text":"Phalangeal articulations of foot may refer to: *Metatarsophalangeal articulations *Interphalangeal articulations of foot ","title":"Phalangeal articulations of foot"},{"id":"14343640","text":"Cathedral Plaza is a class A office building in the city of Bucharest, Romania.

Joseph Ludwig Colmar (born at Strasburg, 22 June 1760; died at Mainz, 15 December 1818) was a German Catholic Bishop of Mainz. Life After his ordination (20 December 1783) he was professor of history and Greek at the Royal Seminary, and curate at St. Stephen's, Strasbourg. During the reign of terror, brought about at Strasbourg by the apostate monk, Eulogius Schneider, he secretly remained in the city, and administered the sacraments. After the fall of Robespierre he went about preaching and instructing. Napoleon appointed him Bishop of Mainz; he was consecrated at Paris, 24 August 1802. The metropolitan see of St. Boniface had been vacant for ten years; the cathedral had been profaned and partially destroyed during the siege of Mainz in 1793; a new diocese had been formed under the old title of Mainz, but subject to the Archbishop of Mechlin; revolution, war, and secularization of convents, monasteries, and the property of the former archdiocese had affected his new diocese.

He opened a seminary (1804), which he placed under the direction of the Venerable Liebermann; he visited parishes and school, and reorganized the religious structure which the Revolution had swept away. He was an active adversary of Wessenberg and the rationalistic liberal tendencies represented by him and the Illuminati. He tried to reintroduce several religious communities in his diocese, but accomplished, however, only the restoration of the Institute of Mary Ward (Dames Anglaises). Shortly before his death he established the sisters of Divine Providence in the Bavarian part of his diocese (the former Diocese of Speyer).

Biography Christoph Eipper was born to Georg Christoph Eipper and Sophie Juliane Schaettler in Esslingen, W√ºrttemberg, Germany. He was the twelfth of fourteen children, eight of which were from his father's previous marriages to Maria Catharina Blankenhorn and Elisabetha Dorothea Ohnmaiss. He studied at the institutions of the Basle Missionary Society, Switzerland, in 1832-36, and of the Church Missionary Society at Islington in 1836. However, despite having received financial support from the Church Missionary Society on condition of accepting Church of England ordination, he and his German colleague Gottlieb Schreiner, father of the novelist Olive Schreiner, refused episcopal ordination because they would not submit to vows of unlimited obedience to a bishop, although they were prepared to receive Lutheran ordination. They consequently ceased their connexion with the Basle Committee. Eipper, together with Schreiner, applied in March 1837 to Rev. John Dunmore Lang for appointment as missionaries to the Aboriginals at Moreton Bay. Schreiner decided to go to South Africa, but Eipper was accepted, together with a party of missionaries under the pastoral care of Rev. Carl Wilhelm Schmidt. On 15 June 1837 at Shoreditch, London, Eipper married Harriet, daughter of John Gyles, a former missionary agriculturist at Tahiti; they had five sons and four daughters. On 27 June he was ordained at an Evangelical service by German and French Protestant clergy resident in London. The united mission party arrived in Sydney in the Minerva in January 1838. Schmidt and Eipper were admitted as members of Lang's Presbyterian Synod of New South Wales on 15 March 1838, and were delegated to form a presbytery of Moreton Bay. Eipper and fourteen others of the party sailed to Moreton Bay in the government schooner Isabella in March 1838 and, on the recommendation of the commandant, Major (Sir) Sydney Cotton, selected a site about seven miles (11 km) from Eagle Farm which they named Zion Hill. Classes were conducted by Eipper, and Rev. J. C. S. Handt helped the newcomers to acquire the Aboriginal dialect. Eipper aged 23 in 1836. Missionary work The early history of the mission was first recorded by Eipper in his Statement of the Origin, Condition, and Prospects of the German Mission to the Aborigines at Moreton Bay (Sydney, 1841). Apart from the routine work, Eipper also travelled among the Aboriginals. When instructed that a new site for a mission was necessary the two ordained missionaries tried to find a suitable place in the Wide Bay district. In March 1843 Eipper joined Dr Stephen Simpson, acting administrator, in an expedition into this district, which Schmidt had already penetrated. Eipper kept a detailed journal of the expedition, which reached the Mary River on 1 April. In July 1843 Schmidt and Eipper jointly reported to the Sydney committee of the Society in Aid of the German Mission to the Aborigines, and again in September, but in October the Sydney society decided to abandon the mission. Eipper approached the Church Missionary Society in London saying that he believed he had been wrong in refusing episcopal ordination and offering to serve in New Zealand or in India. He was conditionally offered the position of master of an English school in India. However, after remaining for a while with the lay missionaries, who proposed to support themselves by manual labour, Eipper was received by the Synod of Australia in connection with the Established Church of Scotland on 5 October 1843. He was Presbyterian minister at Braidwood, New South Wales 1844-46, at Strath Allan and district 1846 without state stipend, and at Paterson late 1847-February 1850. Marriages and children Christoph Eipper married Harriet Gyles on 15 June 1837 in Saint Leonards, Shoreditch, London, England. He was 23 and she was 22. They had eight children together: * Maria Jane Eipper (1839‚Äì1930) * John William Christopher Eipper (1840‚Äì1905), editor of the Maitland Mercury newspaper. * Sarah Harriet Louisa Eipper (1842‚Äì1844), died young. * Sophia Matilda Eipper (1843‚Äì1915), married William Ralph Hush, grandson of Ralph Hush, in 1865 in Braidwood. * George Hugh Coghill Eipper (1845‚Äì1895), married Louisa Beck in 1877 in Sydney. * Frank Ross Eipper (1847-1942), married Maud Campbell in Singleton, New South Wales, then Leila Sarah Ayling in Newtown, New South Wales. * Albert Edward James Eipper (1849‚Äì1925), married Mary Johnston Allen in 1878 in Scone. * Samuel Frederick Eipper (1852‚Äì1935), married Eliza Hannah Ayling in 1880 in Scone. Christoph and Harriet had 38 grandchildren. Later life and death In 1851 he retired from the ministry. Bridges' assessment is that he was not successful as a missionary or a minister. Eipper later held several teaching positions at Muswellbrook and Aberdeen. He died at Charleyong, now known as Marlowe in the Braidwood district on 2 September 1894. His eldest son, J. W. Christopher (1840‚Äì1905), was editor of the Maitland Mercury. One grandson, Rev. Albert James, became a noted Presbyterian missionary to the Aboriginals at Broome and Thursday Island. His other sons were pioneers in the Scone, Tomalla and Warrah districts. He is the great-grandfather of Sir John Cornforth Bibliography  * Historical Records of Australia, Series I, vols 19-20; J. D.

He is a Managing Director and CEO of J.C. Flowers & Co., and a member of the firm's Management Committee. Early life and education Flowers was born in California and grew up in Wayland, Massachusetts. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University with a degree in Applied Mathematics. Professional career Flowers worked at Goldman Sachs for 19 years starting in March 1979, and was a founder of Goldman's lucrative financial institutions merger practice in the 1980s. Flowers was named partner in 1988, the same year as former Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein and former Merrill Lynch CEO John Thain.36 New Goldman Partners Symbolize a Global Outlook. New York Times, October 18, 1988 At 31, he was one of the youngest Goldman Sachs partners in history. Flowers retired from Goldman in 1998, one of fifteen partners to leave the bank prior to its 1998 initial public offering. In 1998, Flowers founded J.C. Flowers & Co., a private equity advisory and fund management firm which has acquired major equity stakes in Shinsei, NIBC Bank, HSH Nordbank and other financial institutions. As of 2017, the company manages assets of US $6.7 billion. Flowers was the main partner of Ripplewood Holdings CEO Tim Collins in the 2000 acquisition of Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan to form Shinsei Bank. He became a director of Shinsei Bank in March 2000 and continues to hold that position. Shinsei's initial public offering in 2004 netted a profit of approximately $1 billion for himself and $7 billion total for his investment group. However, the value of the investor group's stake decreased in the following years. After an unsuccessful attempt to arrange an acquisition of Sallie Mae in 2007, Flowers became deeply involved in the financial crisis of September 2008. He was approached by AIG to advise it on avoiding an imminent financial collapse. Flowers was well acquainted with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson from their days together at Goldman Sachs, and was among the first to warn Paulson of the impending disaster at AIG. Flowers continued to advise Bank of America as it gave up on a Lehman acquisition and went on to acquire Merrill Lynch. Flowers's role in the crisis was portrayed by Michael O'Keefe in the 2011 HBO film Too Big to Fail. In September 2008, Flowers also purchased the First National Bank of Cainesville, a regional bank in Missouri, renaming it Flowers National Bank. Flowers sold the bank to Farmers Bank of Northern Missouri in 2016. In June 2014, Flowers completed the first public listing of a British bank on the London Stock Exchange‚Äôs main market for more than a decade when he floated U.K. bank OneSavings Bank (OSB), a small business and mortgage lender he bought into in 2010. Later that year he argued that banking regulations in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis had depressed profitability so much that lenders would struggle to attract enough investors to survive the next financial crisis. In 2016, Fortune reported that he suffered heavy losses from the Brexit vote, largely as a result of private equity investments in OSB; however, by 2018, Flowers had completely exited OSB in one of the most profitable recent financial services deals. In 2016, Flowers took a stance on the growing fintech sector, stating that it would \\"mostly end in tears\\" because ‚Äúthe tech idea that you must get big fast and dominate a sector\\" is not transferable to the financial-services sector.

It was the first road between the Tualatin Valley and Portland and contributed significantly to Portland becoming the area's major deep water port, and subsequent early growth of the city. The total modern length is . The Great Plank Road Plaque commemorating The Great Plank Road By 1851 a dirt road, which was often muddy, ran between Portland and the Tualatin Valley‚Äîstarting on Jefferson Street at the Willamette River then passing through Tanner Creek Canyon that cuts through the Tualatin Mountains. A plank road was suggested by Portland entrepreneur and proprietor Daniel H. Lownsdale as a means to transport abundant Tualatin Valley farm produce and grains to California Gold Rush-inflated markets in San Francisco, California. Col. William Williams Chapman, another proprietor, expended time and expense providing the basics for fledgling Portland in an effort to counter competition by other upstart towns and Hudson's Bay Company. He founded The Oregonian, enlarged Portland's platt, improving the city's streets, and ushered construction of Canyon Road. Others already invested in the city contributed to help make Portland the prime seaport of the region, including persuading others to join them, removing river obstructions, and importing goods from Asia and beyond. The Portland & Valley Plank Road Company was chartered in January 1851 by the territorial government. Editor of the Weekly Oregonian newspaper, Thomas J. Dryer, immediately invested $500 and promoted the project. Stephen Coffin and William W. Chapman pledged $3000, with Daniel H. Lownsdale pledging $2,000. Ultimately over $35,000 was pledged but not all was paid, with Coffin, Chapman and Lownsdale likely to have not paid in full. Coffin gave the contract to a sawmill owned by himself and Simeon Reed, and the first plank was laid on September 27, 1851, leading to a large celebration. By November 1851, less than $3,000 in pledges had been collected, while $11,000 had been spent. The road had progressed fewer than three miles. The route, however, was excavated, following the canyon of Tanner Creek on the east side of the Tualatin Mountains. By spring of 1852, just over $6,000 had been collected and $14,000 spent, leading to the replacement of management and directors. The project remained incomplete for three years until Supreme Court Justice Cyrus Olney required subscribers to pay at least 80% of the pledged amount. Back wages were still owed by December 1855, leading Olney to demand full payment from subscribers and for county sheriffs to find delinquent subscribers. On January 25, 1856, the territorial government hired a new company to complete the road, and the city's merchant leaders (including William S. Ladd and Josiah Failing) raised $75,000 for the new Portland and Tualatin Plains Plank Road Company, finishing the road by the end of 1856. The road, though never completely planked, was favored by farmers of Polk, Yamhill, and Washington counties since it saved between three and ten miles (16 km) travel to the next nearest ports at St. Johns and St. Helens, but on a rough muddy road through deep woods. Harvey W. Scott said this new toll road was still difficult for travel and the entrance was \\"almost inaccessible\\", but the road was finished. Part of Highway 26 now passes through Tanner Creek Canyon‚Äîthe canyon near the Oregon Zoo as the highway approaches Portland's Goose Hollow neighborhood via the Vista Ridge Tunnels. However, Tanner Creek Canyon was originally a much deeper and narrower ravine. In the early twentieth century, when Tanner Creek was buried as it passes through Tanner Creek Canyon, the canyon was enlarged and infilled to raise Canyon Road. Then, in the 1960s when I-405 was being constructed, the excavated dirt was trucked into the canyon to further expand and fill Tanner Creek Canyon. In August 2015, remnants of the Great Plank Road were unearthed during a road widening project in Beaverton. The pieces weren't salvageable.  Route  The historic route is almost completely paved over by modern roads. Beginning at Goose Hollow near where the Vista Bridge is now (), Jefferson Street transitions into Canyon Road, both in street signs and modern maps. It went up the canyon behind the Vista Ridge Tunnels where the Sunset Highway‚Äîalso known as U.S. Route 26‚Äîgoes over Sylvan hill. Slightly west of Sylvan, an interchange with modern Canyon Road, also known as Oregon Route 8, continues southwest into Beaverton. Two blocks west of Cedar Hills Boulevard, at the junction with Hocken Road (), the contemporary road name changes to Tualatin Valley Highway (\\"TV Highway\\", though the original plank road continued farther west. A plaque to commemorate the road was placed in the South Park Blocks by the Lang Syne Society in 1991.

Both precision and recall are therefore based on an understanding and measure of relevance. Suppose a computer program for recognizing dogs in photographs identifies 8 dogs in a picture containing 10 cats and 12 dogs (the relevant elements). Of the 8 identified as dogs, 5 actually are dogs (true positives), while the other 3 are cats (false positives). 7 dogs were missed (false negatives), and 7 cats were correctly excluded (true negatives). The program's precision is 5/8 (true positives / all positives) while its recall is 5/12 (true positives / relevant elements). When a search engine returns 30 pages, only 20 of which were relevant, while failing to return 40 additional relevant pages, its precision is 20/30 = 2/3 while its recall is 20/60 = 1/3. So, in this case, precision is \\"how valid the search results are\\", and recall is \\"how complete the results are\\". Adopting a hypothesis-testing approach from statistics, in which, in this case, the null hypothesis is that a given item is irrelevant, i.e., not a dog, absence of type I and type II errors (i.e. perfect sensitivity and specificity of 100% each) corresponds respectively to perfect precision (no false positive) and perfect recall (no false negative). More generally, recall is simply the complement of the type II error rate, i.e., one minus the type II error rate. Precision is related to the type I error rate, but in a slightly more complicated way, as it also depends upon the prior distribution of seeing a relevant vs an irrelevant item. The above cat and dog example contained 8 ‚àí 5 = 3 type I errors, for a type I error rate of 3/10, and 12 ‚àí 5 = 7 type II errors, for a type II error rate of 7/12. Precision can be seen as a measure of quality, and recall as a measure of quantity. Higher precision means that an algorithm returns more relevant results than irrelevant ones, and high recall means that an algorithm returns most of the relevant results (whether or not irrelevant ones are also returned). Introduction In information retrieval, the instances are documents and the task is to return a set of relevant documents given a search term. Recall is the number of relevant documents retrieved by a search divided by the total number of existing relevant documents, while precision is the number of relevant documents retrieved by a search divided by the total number of documents retrieved by that search. In a classification task, the precision for a class is the number of true positives (i.e. the number of items correctly labelled as belonging to the positive class) divided by the total number of elements labelled as belonging to the positive class (i.e. the sum of true positives and false positives, which are items incorrectly labelled as belonging to the class). Recall in this context is defined as the number of true positives divided by the total number of elements that actually belong to the positive class (i.e. the sum of true positives and false negatives, which are items which were not labelled as belonging to the positive class but should have been). In information retrieval, a perfect precision score of 1.0 means that every result retrieved by a search was relevant (but says nothing about whether all relevant documents were retrieved) whereas a perfect recall score of 1.0 means that all relevant documents were retrieved by the search (but says nothing about how many irrelevant documents were also retrieved). In a classification task, a precision score of 1.0 for a class C means that every item labelled as belonging to class C does indeed belong to class C (but says nothing about the number of items from class C that were not labelled correctly) whereas a recall of 1.0 means that every item from class C was labeled as belonging to class C (but says nothing about how many items from other classes were incorrectly also labeled as belonging to class C). Often, there is an inverse relationship between precision and recall, where it is possible to increase one at the cost of reducing the other. Brain surgery provides an illustrative example of the tradeoff. Consider a brain surgeon removing a cancerous tumor from a patient‚Äôs brain. The surgeon needs to remove all of the tumour cells since any remaining cancer cells will regenerate the tumor. Conversely, the surgeon must not remove healthy brain cells since that would leave the patient with impaired brain function. The surgeon may be more liberal in the area of the brain he removes to ensure he has extracted all the cancer cells. This decision increases recall but reduces precision. On the other hand, the surgeon may be more conservative in the brain he removes to ensure he extracts only cancer cells. This decision increases precision but reduces recall. That is to say, greater recall increases the chances of removing healthy cells (negative outcome) and increases the chances of removing all cancer cells (positive outcome). Greater precision decreases the chances of removing healthy cells (positive outcome) but also decreases the chances of removing all cancer cells (negative outcome). Usually, precision and recall scores are not discussed in isolation. Instead, either values for one measure are compared for a fixed level at the other measure (e.g. precision at a recall level of 0.75) or both are combined into a single measure. Examples of measures that are a combination of precision and recall are the F-measure (the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall), or the Matthews correlation coefficient, which is a geometric mean of the chance- corrected variants: the regression coefficients Informedness (DeltaP') and Markedness (DeltaP). Accuracy is a weighted arithmetic mean of Precision and Inverse Precision (weighted by Bias) as well as a weighted arithmetic mean of Recall and Inverse Recall (weighted by Prevalence). Inverse Precision and Inverse Recall are simply the Precision and Recall of the inverse problem where positive and negative labels are exchanged (for both real classes and prediction labels). Recall and Inverse Recall, or equivalently true positive rate and false positive rate, are frequently plotted against each other as ROC curves and provide a principled mechanism to explore operating point tradeoffs. Outside of Information Retrieval, the application of Recall, Precision and F-measure are argued to be flawed as they ignore the true negative cell of the contingency table, and they are easily manipulated by biasing the predictions. The first problem is 'solved' by using Accuracy and the second problem is 'solved' by discounting the chance component and renormalizing to Cohen's kappa, but this no longer affords the opportunity to explore tradeoffs graphically. However, Informedness and Markedness are Kappa- like renormalizations of Recall and Precision, and their geometric mean Matthews correlation coefficient thus acts like a debiased F-measure.  Definition (information retrieval context)  In information retrieval contexts, precision and recall are defined in terms of a set of retrieved documents (e.g. the list of documents produced by a web search engine for a query) and a set of relevant documents (e.g. the list of all documents on the internet that are relevant for a certain topic), cf. relevance.* =Precision= In the field of information retrieval, precision is the fraction of retrieved documents that are relevant to the query: \\\\text{precision}=\\\\frac{\\\\\\\\{\\\\text{relevant documents}\\\\\\\\}\\\\cap\\\\\\\\{\\\\text{retrieved documents}\\\\\\\\}}{\\\\\\\\{\\\\text{retrieved documents}\\\\\\\\}} For example, for a text search on a set of documents, precision is the number of correct results divided by the number of all returned results. Precision takes all retrieved documents into account, but it can also be evaluated at a given cut-off rank, considering only the topmost results returned by the system. This measure is called precision at n or P@n. Precision is used with recall, the percent of all relevant documents that is returned by the search. The two measures are sometimes used together in the F1 Score (or f-measure) to provide a single measurement for a system. Note that the meaning and usage of \\"precision\\" in the field of information retrieval differs from the definition of accuracy and precision within other branches of science and technology. =Recall= In information retrieval, recall is the fraction of the relevant documents that are successfully retrieved. \\\\text{recall}=\\\\frac{\\\\\\\\{\\\\text{relevant documents}\\\\\\\\}\\\\cap\\\\\\\\{\\\\text{retrieved documents}\\\\\\\\}}{\\\\\\\\{\\\\text{relevant documents}\\\\\\\\}} For example, for a text search on a set of documents, recall is the number of correct results divided by the number of results that should have been returned. In binary classification, recall is called sensitivity. It can be viewed as the probability that a relevant document is retrieved by the query. It is trivial to achieve recall of 100% by returning all documents in response to any query. Therefore, recall alone is not enough but one needs to measure the number of non-relevant documents also, for example by also computing the precision.  Definition (classification context)  For classification tasks, the terms true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives (see Type I and type II errors for definitions) compare the results of the classifier under test with trusted external judgments. The terms positive and negative refer to the classifier's prediction (sometimes known as the expectation), and the terms true and false refer to whether that prediction corresponds to the external judgment (sometimes known as the observation). Let us define an experiment from P positive instances and N negative instances for some condition. The four outcomes can be formulated in a 2√ó2 contingency table or confusion matrix, as follows: Precision and recall are then defined as:Olson, David L.; and Delen, Dursun (2008); Advanced Data Mining Techniques, Springer, 1st edition (February 1, 2008), page 138, \\\\text{Precision}=\\\\frac{tp}{tp+fp} \\\\, \\\\text{Recall}=\\\\frac{tp}{tp+fn} \\\\, Recall in this context is also referred to as the true positive rate or sensitivity, and precision is also referred to as positive predictive value (PPV); other related measures used in classification include true negative rate and accuracy. True negative rate is also called specificity. \\\\text{True negative rate}=\\\\frac{tn}{tn+fp} \\\\, Imbalanced data \\\\text{Accuracy}=\\\\frac{tp+tn}{tp+tn+fp+fn} \\\\, Accuracy can be a misleading metric for imbalanced data sets. Consider a sample with 95 negative and 5 positive values. Classifying all values as negative in this case gives 0.95 accuracy score. There are many metrics that don't suffer from this problem. For example, balanced accuracy (bACC) normalizes true positive and true negative predictions by the number of positive and negative samples, respectively, and divides their sum by two: \\\\text{Balanced accuracy}= \\\\frac{TPR + TNR}{2}\\\\, For the previous example (95 negative and 5 positive samples), classifying all as negative gives 0.5 balanced accuracy score (the maximum bACC score is one), which is equivalent to the expected value of a random guess in a balanced data set. Balanced accuracy can serve as an overall performance metric for a model, whether or not the true labels are imbalanced in the data, assuming the cost of FN is the same as FP. Another metric is the predicted positive condition rate (PPCR), which identifies the percentage of the total population that is flagged. For example, for a search engine that returns 30 results (retrieved documents) out of 1,000,000 documents, the PPCR is 0.003%. \\\\text{Predicted positive condition rate}=\\\\frac{tp+fp}{tp+fp+tn+fn} \\\\, According to Saito and Rehmsmeier, precision-recall plots are more informative than ROC plots when evaluating binary classifiers on imbalanced data. In such scenarios, ROC plots may be visually deceptive with respect to conclusions about the reliability of classification performance.  Probabilistic interpretation  One can also interpret precision and recall not as ratios but as estimations of probabilities:Fatih Cakir, Kun He, Xide Xia, Brian Kulis, Stan Sclaroff, Deep Metric Learning to Rank, In Proc. IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019. * Precision is the estimated probability that a document randomly selected from the pool of retrieved documents is relevant. * Recall is the estimated probability that a document randomly selected from the pool of relevant documents is retrieved. Another interpretation is that precision is the average probability of relevant retrieval and recall is the average probability of complete retrieval averaged over multiple retrieval queries.  F-measure  A measure that combines precision and recall is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, the traditional F-measure or balanced F-score: F = 2 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{precision} \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{recall}}{ \\\\mathrm{precision} + \\\\mathrm{recall}} This measure is approximately the average of the two when they are close, and is more generally the harmonic mean, which, for the case of two numbers, coincides with the square of the geometric mean divided by the arithmetic mean. There are several reasons that the F-score can be criticized in particular circumstances due to its bias as an evaluation metric. This is also known as the F_1 measure, because recall and precision are evenly weighted. It is a special case of the general F_\\\\beta measure (for non- negative real values of \\\\beta): F_\\\\beta = (1 + \\\\beta^2) \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{precision} \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{recall} }{ \\\\beta^2 \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{precision} + \\\\mathrm{recall}} Two other commonly used F measures are the F_2 measure, which weights recall higher than precision, and the F_{0.5} measure, which puts more emphasis on precision than recall. The F-measure was derived by van Rijsbergen (1979) so that F_\\\\beta \\"measures the effectiveness of retrieval with respect to a user who attaches \\\\beta times as much importance to recall as precision\\". It is based on van Rijsbergen's effectiveness measure E_{\\\\alpha} = 1 - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{P} + \\\\frac{1-\\\\alpha}{R}}, the second term being the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall with weights (\\\\alpha, 1-\\\\alpha). Their relationship is F_\\\\beta = 1 - E_{\\\\alpha} where \\\\alpha=\\\\frac{1}{1 + \\\\beta^2}. Limitations as goals There are other parameters and strategies for performance metric of information retrieval system, such as the area under the ROC curve (AUC).Zygmunt ZajƒÖc.

Philipp Krementz was born, the son of a butcher, in Koblenz in 1837 and began to study theology in Bonn, which he continued in Munich in 1839. After his ordination on 27 August 1842 in Koblenz, he worked as a chaplain. In 1846 he worked as a religion teacher at the Knight's Academy in Bedburg. In January 1848 he became pastor of St. Castor in Koblenz and 1853 Dean of the Deanery in Koblenz. On 21 June 1859 he was appointed an honorary canon of Trier Cathedral, which he refused. In 1864 and 1867 he was on the list of candidates for the episcopal elections in Cologne and Trier. The chapter of Frombork cathedral elected Krementz, who was favored by the Queen of Prussia and whom he knew personally, as Bishop of Warmia on 22 October 1867. He was enthroned on 24 May 1868. He was consecrated bishop by the archbishop of Cologne Paul Melchers on 3 May. In 1868, he received an honorary citizen of his home town of Koblenz. He participated in the First Vatican Council of 1869. He left Rome with 54 other bishops before the end of the Council. Therefore, he did not take part in the solemn vote of 18 July 1870. However, he leaned the Council decisions and preached the infallibility dogma in his diocese. In 1872, he excommunicated five clergy from his diocese who were against the infallibility of the Pope, which led to a conflict with the Prussian state. The conflict ended on 25 September 1872. In March 1885, the Vatican and the Prussian State agreed on the replacement of the vacant chair of the Archbishop of Cologne. Pope Leo XIII appointed Krementz as the new Archbishop of Cologne on 30 July 1885. He was installed on December 15. In 1886, he became chairman of the German Bishops' Conference in Fulda. On 16 January 1893, he was elevated to cardinal. He was assigned the titular church of San Crisogono. At the end of his life, the archbishop was completely mentally shattered and could be dissuaded with difficulty by a belief that the world would end by the year 1950. Philipp Krementz died on 6 May 1899 in Cologne and was buried in the crypt of Cologne Cathedral.

Once popular among match shooters in the 1940s, it has since fallen by the wayside in favor of newer developments. It is, however, held in high regard for its accuracy, and is widely considered the grandfather of benchrest cartridges. Today the round occupies a niche in the falling-block rifle market. There are three notable versions of the Wasp. The first, designed in the mid 1930s and today known as the 219 Gipson Wasp, was named after the gunsmith who chambered the first Wasp rifle for Donaldson. This version has a case length measuring 1.625\\" and was formed from rimless 25 Remington brass. Donaldson shifted his experimentation to the 219 Zipper brass soon after the introduction of that cartridge by Winchester in 1937. By approximately 1940, Donaldson had lengthened the body of the Wasp case to increase capacity from around 24 to 28 grains of IMR 3031 powder - to see if velocity could be increased while maintaining accuracy. To Donaldson's delight, the larger case produced both higher velocity and superior accuracy. This development work is detailed in a series of letters written by Donaldson and collectively published in Yours Truly.Wolfe Publishing Company (1980) Donaldson later lengthened the neck by about 1/32\\" so as not to encroach on powder capacity when using a graphite wad behind the bullet.

Bastian Balthazar Bux Bastian Balthazar Bux is a shy and bookish boy around 12 years old who is raised by his father and still mourning the sudden death of his mother (she died of an unspecified illness). He is a dreamer, who is shunned by other children due to his immense imagination. During a visit to an antique bookstore, he steals a curious-looking book titled The Neverending Story, and upon reading it finds himself literally drawn into the story. Halfway through the book, Bastian becomes a character in The Neverending Story, in a world called Fantastica.(\\"Fantasia\\" in the films, sometimes). As the story progresses, Bastian slowly loses his memories of the real world as his wishes carry him throughout Fantastica and change him into a completely different person. Deluded by the witch Xayide, Bastian moves to the Ivory Tower and tries to have himself proclaimed Emperor. The ceremony is interrupted by Atreyu, who is nearly killed by Bastian. Eventually, Bastian realizes that he is beginning to lose himself, and starts a desperate last-ditch quest for his one true desire. In the end he forgets even his name, but with the help of Falkor and Atreyu, he manages to return to the human world with the capability of loving, and brings to his father the Water of Life, curing him of his melancholy. Bastian and Coreander exchange tales of their adventures in Fantastica, and Coreander reveals that a person can return to Fantastica as many times as they can think of new names for the benevolent Childlike Empress. Bastian has been portrayed by five different actors: * 1984: Barret Oliver in The NeverEnding Story. * 1990: Jonathan Brandis in The NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter.(J. Michael Haney, Jr. as Young Bastian) * 1994: Jason James Richter in The NeverEnding Story III. * 1996: Christopher Bell provided the voice of the character in The Neverending Story animated series. * 2001: Mark Rendall in Tales from the Neverending Story Atreyu Atreyu is the protagonist of the mysterious book that Bastian reads. He is a young green-skinned warrior from the Grassy Plain. His parents were killed by a Purple Buffalo soon after he was born, and his entire village raised him; wherefore his name means \\"son of all\\" in his native language. He is summoned by the Childlike Empress to save the land of Fantasia by finding a cure for her illness, and given Auryn, an amulet that makes whoever wears it the Childlike Empress' herald. During the quest to find a cure, he meets Falkor the luckdragon, who becomes his steed after the death of his horse Artax. Bastian, reading Atreyu's story in the real world, experiences everything Atreyu does; this proves Fantasia's solution and the Empress' cure, in bringing Bastian to Fantatasia to give the Empress a new name. Atreyu plays a prominent role in the second half of the novel, as Bastian travels Fantastica far and wide as its savior. They quickly become friends, but as Bastian continues to use AURYN, he becomes arrogant and gradually loses his memories. When Bastian has lost even his name, Atreyu and Falkor offer favorable testimony to the powers in AURYN, who allow Bastian's return to the human world. With their friendship restored, Atreyu promises to finish the stories Bastian has begun in Fantastica. In the 1984 film version, the character of Atreyu is played by Noah Hathaway. His skin is ultimately not olive green as described in the novel; though it was attempted to do this through makeup, it never made it to the final production. As such, his people were ultimately called the Plains People instead of Greenskins. The character makes a return appearance in The NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter, played by Kenny Morrison. In the 1995 animated show, Atreyu (voiced by Dominic Zamprogna) has a younger sister named Saiya, and his outward appearance has been patterned after Noah Hathaway from the first film, although this version has green skin like his novel version. In the 2001 Hallmark Channel mini-series, Tales from the Neverending Story, he is portrayed by Tyler Hynes and the character's people are called the Woodland People. He is shown to have a romantic relationship with a young aviatrix called \\"Fly Girl\\", and to be something of a village innocent. =Atreyu in popular culture= * The American metalcore band, Atreyu, took its name from this character from The Neverending Story. * Atreyu and Artax inspired Listener's song \\"Failing is Not Just for Failures\\". * In Comedy Central's Workaholics season 5 episode 10 (Trivia Pursuits), Adam and Blake argue over who gets to be Atreyu when deciding on their costumes for an upcoming 1980s trivia contest against three Asian men who are also street racers. * A track on The Lonely Island's album, Turtleneck and Chain, called Falcor Vs. Atreyu - Classy Skit #1 depicts the titular duo having sex. Carl Conrad Coreander Carl Conrad Coreander (German spelling: Karl Konrad Koreander) is a cantankerous bookseller; Bastian finds and steals the Neverending Story from his store. The novel states that Mr. Coreander is one of the few humans who has been to Fantastica and returned. He and Bastian come to a better understanding and share telling the stories of their adventures to one another. Coreander is portrayed by Thomas Hill in the first film, and was the only actor who reprised his role in the second film; however, in the third film, he is played by Freddie Jones. In the cartoon series, Coreander is voiced by Chris Wiggins. In the 2001 television series, Tales from the Neverending Story, he functions in a double role as a wizard in Fantasia wherein he is called \\"the Curiosity\\". The Childlike Empress The Childlike Empress is the monarch of Fantastica, who resides in the capital called Ivory tower in the heart of the realm. Although she is nominally the ruler of Fantastica, she rarely interacts with the outside world. Should she die, Fantastica and all Fantasticans would cease to exist. The amulet known as the Auryn is her emblem, and those who wear it are her representatives. As explained by Morla the Aged One, her lifetime is not measured in years, but by names, which only the imagination of a human child can give her. When she begins to need a new name, she begins to fade away, causing the Nothing to appear in Fantastica. She sends Atreyu on the Great Quest, which brings Bastian to Fantastica, and Bastian gives her the name of Moon Child, which restores Fantastica. The Empress' description is that of an indescribably beautiful young girl, appearing no older than ten, yet much older than the oldest Fantasticans. Her hair is snow-white, as is her gown, and her eyes are the color of gold, earning her the title Golden-Eyed Commander of Wishes. The role was portrayed by Tami Stronach in Wolfgang Petersen's 1984 adaptation, by Alexandra Johnes in The NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter (1990) and by Julie Cox (apparently as an adolescent) in The NeverEnding Story III (1994). In the films, her hair is dark, rather than white, and in the first film, she is dressed like a bride. In the 1995 cartoon series, the Childlike Empress has golden hair and wears a green gown, and is voiced by Lisa Yamanaka. In the 2001 television series Tales from the Neverending Story, the Empress, again depicted with dark hair, was played by Audrey Gardiner. Engywook and Urgl Engywook and his wife Urgl are a quarrelsome pair of gnomes who live close to the Southern Oracle. Engywook is a research scientist who has studied the Southern Oracle and her three gates for most of his life, but has never entered any. His wife Urgl often gets in his way while brewing potions in a large cauldron for healing wounded people. Engywook can observe the Riddle Gate, also known as the Sphinxes, from his telescope on a hilltop overlooking the first gate. In the book, Urgl removes poison from Atreyu and Engywook instructs him about the three gates that lead to the Southern Oracle. This scene is portrayed in the 1984 film. Engywook is played by Sydney Bromley and Urgl is played by Patricia Hayes. In the third film of the series, Engywook (played by Tony Robinson) and Urgl (played by Moya Brady) have moved to a forest and still argue continuously. The house is stepped on by Bastian during his return trip to Fantasia, although it is then completely destroyed by the Nasties. The two go with Bastian, Falkor, and Bark Troll to find the Empress for help, but are stranded on Earth and arrive in Alaska, where they mail themselves to the others and return home, their house rebuilt. In the 1995 cartoon series, Engywook and Urgl are voiced by Wayne Robson and Barbara Byrne. Falkor Falkor (German: Fuchur) is a companion of Atreyu and Bastian. He is the only luckdragon to appear, although five others are mentioned in passing. He helps Atreyu find a cure for the Empress after escaping the web of Ygramul the Many. The original name Fuchur is derived from the Japanese . It was changed in the English translation because the pronunciation of the original name is similar to an English expletive. Personality wise, Falkor is optimistic, friendly, dignified, helpful and wise, trying to help Bastian remember to \\"never give up and good luck will find you\\". Falkor has an elongated body with rudimentary paws and pink scales and hairs that appear white in dull light. His head is described less precisely, though his eyes are given the color of rubies. In the illustrations of the German novel, he appears much like a Chinese dragon or his appearance is of a camel; whereas a cover for the book by Dan Craig illustrated Falkor as lion- like; and in the 1984 film adaptation of the novel, Falkor has canine features upon a white furred body, not unlike a Great Pyrenees dog, and is pleased by affectionate scratchings behind his ear. Luckdragons possess neither an immense physical strength, nor great magical talents, though they can exhale blue fire. Their only distinctive ability is incredible luck in everything they do, as shown when Falkor locates and rescues his companion after being lost in a violent, blinding storm. Luckdragons never stop drawing air and heat through their scales, which makes eating unnecessary and makes submersion in water deadly to them. Luckdragons are capable of sleeping while flying, and prefer to occupy as much open space as possible. In the first film, Falkor is voiced by Alan Oppenheimer. In the second film, Falkor is voiced by an uncredited Donald Arthur. In the third film, Falkor is performed by Gord Robertson and voiced by William Hootkins. In the cartoon series, Falkor is voiced by Howard Jerome. Bavaria Film Studios retains a \\"side view Falkor\\" which tourists can climb and ride. The prop is the last remaining version of Falkor from the original film and was used for blue-screen side angle shots.Falkor is very wise, incredibly optimistic, dignified and a very friendly sophisticated being from Fantasia. He gives advice to people when they have lost hope in many things they set out to do whether in a quest for what they seek or in some cases people and beings have given up altogether and lost faith. Mostly during the Nothings destruction of Fantasia he helps Atreyu along the way of his quest to stop The Nothing. Falkor's attitude purely comes from his heart, it is proven that his openness to making friends means a lot to everyone he encounters, into which Falkor in return treasures every friendship he has. Falkor however never wants to make enemies, only those who are threats to his friends or threats in general towards Fantasia itself. There is no knowledge of anyone or anything in Fantasia who has been hostile towards Falkor, only The Nothing and G'mork were his only true foes. The other thing to point out is that Falkor never likes to be alone, he is always wanting to be close or even in the company of other beings or creatures of Fantasia, Falkor loves to have friends and ones who he knows will be loyal to him and not betray his good will and open heart. Falkor also likes to look after and shelter those who have been injured or are unconscious or even maybe in general he likes to keep people safe within his reach, this is proven as Atreyu ends up sleeping in Falkor's paws within the duration of when Atreyu was in his recovery phase after he was rescued from the Swamps of Sadness by him. Gmork Gmork is the servant of the power behind the Nothing. His appearance in the book is that of a large, wolf-like creature with night-black fur and capable of human speech; but the film gives him blue-black fur and luminous green cat-like eyes, as well as more fangs than an ordinary wolf would have. He, and other dual-natured creatures like him, are able to travel between worlds, changing into a Fantastican or a human depending upon the world. Atreyu finally meets Gmork in Spook City, where he is chained, and Atreyu employs the name Nobody to hide his identity in shame of his failure to complete his quest. Gmork confesses that he has been hunting a boy sent on a quest by the Childlike Empress to find her a new name, but lost him early on. He then met the Princess of Darkness, Gaya, who upon hearing of his mission to help the Nothing, chained Gmork with an unbreakable chain and leapt into the Nothing, leaving him to starve. Gmork explains to Atreyu the nature of the Nothing, and that a Fantastican who enters it, must become a lie in the human world. Eventually, Gmork reveals the name of the boy he is pursuing, and Atreyu reveals his identity, which causes Gmork to laugh until he finally succumbs to starvation. As Atreyu approaches the dead wolf, the carcass grabs Atreyu in its jaws, which, ironically, prevents Atreyu from succumbing to the overpowering urge exerted by the Nothing to throw himself into it. He is freed from Gmork's grip by Falkor, who escapes with him to the Ivory Tower. In the film, Gmork almost manages to kill Atreyu in the Swamps of Sadness, but Atreyu is saved by Falkor. Their meeting in Spook City occurs in the film as well, where Gmork attacks Atreyu, impaling himself on an improvised stone knife held by the young warrior. In the cartoon series, Gmork has a werewolf-like appearance and is voiced by Don Francks. Grograman Grograman, also known as The Many Colored Death, is the guardian of Goab, the Desert of Colors, which exists in a symbiosis with Perilin the Night Forest. He appears in the form of a huge lion, who changes colors to suit the color of sand under his feet and changes all life around him into sand. Grograman turns into an obsidian statue at night to allow the growth of Perilin. Grograman is the first creature Bastian meets upon his arrival in Fantastica. Bastian is protected from the effect of Grograman's death aura by Auryn and is thus the first living being ever to make friends with him. Grograman is the first one who teaches Bastian something of the nature of Fantastica and he gives Bastian his magic sword Sikanda. One night, Bastian is called away. He promises to return, but is ultimately unable to keep his promise. In the animated series, Grograman (voiced by Gary Krawford) burns down Perilin to protect Fantastica from being overrun by its roots and branches. He is later captured by Xayide and freed by Bastian. Morla Morla, also known as The Ancient One, is a giant turtle who lives in the Swamps of Sadness: as the oldest living Fantastican, she has grown indifferent to the fate of Fantastica and her own survival. Reluctantly, she informs Atreyu that the Empress needs a new name and points Atreyu to the Southern Oracle. In the book and film, Morla has an allergy to youth (Atreyu) and sneezes violently in his presence. This version also knows nothing about the illness of the Empress, but sends Atreyu directly to the Southern Oracle. In the cartoon series, Morla is voiced by Pam Hyatt. The Old Man of Wandering Mountain The Old Man of Wandering Mountain is an elderly chronicler whose chronicle contains all events in Fantastica. He lives alone in an egg-shaped home on top of the Wandering Mountain, which can be found only by chance or fate. The Old Man appears in the story when the Childlike Empress is forced to use drastic measures to make Bastian fulfill his part in the story. As she approaches his mountain, the Old Man tries to dissuade her from entering to the point of insulting her. On her request, the Old Man reads from his chronicle (starting with Bastian entering the book store). As he reads, all events happen again and as they happen again, he writes them down again beginning a vicious circle of eternal repetition which drives Bastian into calling out the Empress' new name. The Old Man ultimately does not appear in the first film, and his appearance in the third film differs drastically from the novel. He possesses the Great Book which can seemingly write the future on its own accord. He dwells in a hidden crystal cave where he can see outside events using a magic mirror. He is visited by the Childlike Empress and her guard Big Head, who remain with him until the end of the Nasty crisis. In this film, he grovels before the Empress and sees it as an honor that the monarch would visit him. Pyornkrachzark Pyornkrachzark is a Rockbiter, a large creature made of stone. The Rockbiter species are named due to their diet of rocks and earth-based materials. The Rockbiter seen in the film particularly has a liking for limestone. In the novel and the first film, the Rockbiter appears early among the messengers sent to see the Childlike Empress at the Ivory Tower during the Nothing crisis. In the first film he ultimately reappears, encountered by Atreyu. He has lost faith in himself after failing to save his travelling companions from the Nothing, and advises Atreyu to flee. Near the end of the film, he and his two traveling companions wave at Bastian as he flies by on Falkor. In the second and third films, Rockbiter's wife appears in the third film and his son appears in the second and third. Rockbiter Junior is the same size as a human, and is rather gluttonous and playful. He is sent to Earth during a wish overload caused by Bastian, Falkor, Bark Troll, Engywook and Urgl; whereupon he is saved from falling to his death by Falkor and they are reunited with Bastian. Rockbiter and his wife nearly split due to the absence of their son and the further effects of the Nasties, who are in possession of the book and Auryn; but the family are reunited at the end of the film. Rockbiter also sings a rather corrupt version of Born To Be Wild by Steppenwolf. In the cartoon series, Mr. and Mrs. Rockbiter are voiced by Harvey Atkin and Jayne Eastwood while Rockbiter Junior is voiced by Lisa Yamanaka. Gluckuk Gluckuk (√úck√ºck) is a Tiny Man (Winzling) riding a racing snail. He was sent by his race to see the Childlike Empress at the Ivory Tower during the Nothing crisis. In the film, he is ultimately called Teeny Weeny and portrayed by Deep Roy. In the cartoon series, Gluckuk and his racing snail are voiced by John Stocker. Whooshwoozool Whooshwoozool (W√∫schwusul) is a Nighthob (Nachtalb) who rides on a bat. He was sent by his race to see the Childlike Empress at the Ivory Tower during the Nothing crisis. In the 1995 cartoon series, the Nighthob is voiced by Adrian Truss. Blubb Blubb is a will-o'-the-wisp sent by his race to see the Childlike Empress at the Ivory Tower during the Nothing crisis. In the cartoon series, Blubb is voiced by John McGrath. The Southern Oracle The Southern Oracle, also known as Uyulala, is a mysterious all- knowing oracle guarded by three magical gates. She is depicted as a disembodied female voice who speaks in rhymed speech and otherwise sings ceaselessly to maintain her existence. To speak with Uyulala, one must pass through the three gates: * The first gate is the Great Riddle Gate, which consists of two Sphinxes who face one another. Those caught between their gaze are frozen on the spot and doomed to remain until they solve every riddle in the world or until they die. * The second gate is the Magic Mirror Gate, a moon-like mirror which reflects the truest nature of the observer. This often frightens people into retreat or hysteria; but the observer, to pass this gate, must walk through its reflection. * The third gate is the No-Key Gate, an indestructible keyless door that responds to a person's will. Only by losing the desire to enter may one get it to open. Once past, Atreyu learns the reason why the Childlike Empress is ill and what he must find in order to restore her health. Uyulala is then quiet and the Southern Oracle with its three gates is silently destroyed by the Nothing. Passing through the first two gates causes Atreyu to first lose all fear, and then all memory of himself. This allows him to open the No-Key Gate, whereat Bastian's voice keeps Atreyu from wandering. The film version of the Southern Oracle shares the generalities; but the first gate judges whether the person attempting to pass through it \\"feels his own worth\\"; if the person is doubtful of its ability to pass through safely, the two Sphinxes incinerate the visitor. The second gate is a mirror like the novel's description, located in a snowy wilderness; and there is ultimately no third gate. The Oracle itself is ultimately two blue glowing Sphinxes like the yellow sphinxes at the first gate, and speaks in prose. As with the novel, the Oracle crumbles and dies after revealing the cure for the Childlike Empress' condition. In Tales from the Neverending Story, a hero must pass through the Riddle Gate, which tests his confidence in himself. He must then answer a riddle and pass through a mirror that displays the necessary thing he needs. In the case of Atreyu, he lands in a library owned by the wizard nicknamed \\"the Curiosity\\" who teaches him to read. Thereafter, he passes through a glass door on which the name Uyulala is inscribed, to find the Oracle much as she is described in the novel. In The Neverending Story cartoon series, the Southern Oracle is depicted as two sphinxes facing each other and are voiced by Ellen Ray Hennessy. Xayide Xayide is an evil sorceress who appears later in the book after Bastian enters the world of Fantasia. Xayide lives in a castle shaped like a hand, called Horok the Seeing Hand, because its multitude of windows appear like human eyes. Xayide's most striking physical feature are her heterochromatic red and green eyes. She can control anything empty, and thus she employs as guards empty suits of plate armour. She presents to Bastian a warm and worshipping exterior, in hope to herself replace the Childlike Empress as ruler of Fantasia. Realizing she cannot defeat Bastian by force, she persuades him to invade the Ivory Tower. After losing Bastian, she is crushed to death by her iron minions who resist her wanting magic. Xayide is portrayed by actress and model Clarissa Burt in The NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter, which is loosely based upon the second half of the novel. In the adaption, she is the personified avatar of an entity similar to the Nothing, called the Emptiness, which is born of the dying imagination of the collective human species. In both media she gives Bastian the belt Ghemmal, which turns its wearer invisible and was intended to spy on Atreyu. She meets her end in the film when Bastian uses his last wish to give her a sense of compassion, whereupon she destroys herself to amend the damage done by her. Xayide is the main villain in the 1995 cartoon series voiced by Janet Laine-Green. In the miniseries Tales from the Neverending Story, Xayide is portrayed as the Childlike Empress' sister and the ruler of a Dark City. Ygramul Ygramul The Many is a creature that lives in the land of Dead Mountains. She is portrayed as a shapeshifter, who often takes form of a giant spider and builds webs to catch its prey. The creature is actually composed of many little hornet-like insects who share a single hive mind. Ygramul's poison is deadly and kills within one hour, but grants the victim the ability to teleport to any location within Fantastica before succumbing to its effects. In the novel, this poison is the means by which Atreyu travels to the home of Engywook and Urgl, near the Southern Oracle. At this point in the story Falkor the luckdragon is introduced; he is caught in Ygramul's web, and also uses the power of Ygramul's poison to follow Atreyu. The lingering effects of the poison are nursed out of the two by Urgl, while Engywook, a scholar of the Southern Oracle, instructs Atreyu on the challenges he is to encounter within the Oracle's demesne. In The Neverending Story cartoon series, Ygramul is shown in her spider form and is voiced by Marilyn Lightstone. In \\"To Save Falkor,\\" Bastian encountered Ygramul in the Dead Mountains while looking for a cure for Falkor's illness. Other characters =Bastian's Dad= Bastian's Dad (portrayed by Gerald McRaney in the first film, John Wesley Shipp in the second film, Kevin McNulty in the third film) is described to have grown distant from his son after the death of his wife, although this changes when he and Bastian are reunited at the end of the book. In the second film, Bastian's father is given the first name Barney Bux and follows Bastian's journey by reading the book and reunited with his son at the conclusion of the film. In the third film, he appears to have no memories of reading the book. He marries a woman named Jane and thus gains a new family, along with a daughter named Nicole who plays a main role in the third film. =Bark Troll= Bark Troll is a supporting character and friend of Bastian who appears in The Neverending Story cartoon, and the third film which is based on the characters as they appeared in the animated series. He is loosely based on three characters of a species called bark trolls, that appeared to advise Atreyu about the Nothing. In the third film, Bark Troll is performed by Kaefan Shaw and voiced by William Hootkins. In the 1995 cartoon series, Bark Troll is voiced by Richard Binsley. =Cairon= Cairon is a herald of the Childlike Empress and in-between bearer of Auryn who passed it to Atreyu. In the novel, he appears as an elderly black centaur with his lower half with the striped pattern of a zebra. In the first film, he ultimately appears as a humanoid and is portrayed by Moses Gunn. By his name and status of a centaur and physician, Cairon is an allusion to the mythological Greek Chiron. =Dame Eyola= Dame Eyola is a plant taking the form of a motherly woman who lives in the House of Change, who cares for Bastian. =The Four Heroes= The Four Heroes are swordsmen who appear in the second half of the novel, said to be the bravest and strongest warriors in all of Fantastica, who participate in a tournament in the Silver City of Amarganth. One is identified as Hero Hynreck (or Huunreck), who is infatuated with Princess Oglamar; the other three, Hykrion, Hysbald and Hydorn, accompany Bastian on his journey and swear allegiance to him. They are often portrayed as cheerful beings, but when Bastian decides to make himself an emperor, they get drunk and become useless. They survive the battle against Atreyu's rebellion but lose track of Bastian, and go their separate ways to look for him. The Four Heroes ultimately do not appear in the film adaptations of the novel. However, Hykrion and Hynreck appeared separately in episodes of the Tales from The Neverending Story television series; \\"Home Sweet Home\\" & \\"The Gift of the Name\\", and \\"The Luck Stops Here\\". =Ilwan= Ilwan (Iluan) is a blue genie with a bird's beak in place of his nose and mouth. Ilwan appeared in the novel where he became one of Bastian's closest servants, but was killed during the battle for the Ivory Tower. =Querquobad= Querquobad, the Silver Sage is the ruler of the silver ship city of Amarganth, which was built by the Acharis and swims on a lake made by their tears. =Large Head= Large Head (voiced by Colin Fox) is a human with a large forehead in the 1995 animated series. He works as an advisor to the Childlike Empress where he and Bastian do not often see eye to eye. The two of them once worked together to solve the attacks on a mountain path by a mountain creature. =Shadow Goblin= Shadow Goblin (voiced by Benedict Campbell) is a character in the animated series who is the master thief of Fantasia. The Shadow Goblin wants nothing more than to become the richest creature in Fantasia. Vermin Vermin (voiced by Len Carlson) is a bat- winged rat who is the Shadow Goblin's henchman. Vermin's job is to spy all over Fantasia for something worth stealing and the Shadow Goblin is the one who steals it. While Shadow Goblin wants to become rich, Vermin mostly thinks about food. =Shexper= Shexper/Shakespeare is mentioned as a past traveller to Fantastica in Chapter XVIII when Hykrion, Hysbald, and Hydorn sing a song (\\"When that I was a little tiny boy, With Hey, Ho, the wind and the rain...\\"). They mention that that song was sung by one called \\"Shexper\\", which is a mispronunciation of the name \\"Shakespeare\\". =Smerg= Smerg (Sm√§rg) is a dragon created by Bastian for Hynreck to slay and prove his worthiness to Princess Oglamar. He had the tail of a scorpion, back legs of a grasshopper, and the wings of a bat. Smerg had the heads of a male and female instead of eyes. He appears in the second film when Bastian wishes him into existence (as in the novel), but in the film, he was ultimately meant to be a new steed to carry Bastian. =Tri-Face= Tri-Face is a three-faced scientist who is Xayide's servant in the second film. Each face represents a part his personality and spin into place depending on his mood. This character is based on a figure from the novel named Four-Quarters Troll (Vier-Vierteltroll) or Temperamentling, who becomes a member of Bastian's entourage. A similar character Threehead is a three-headed knight, and Xayide's servant in the 1995 animated series voiced by James Rankin. Each of Threehead's personalities is represented by a different head and pop up depending on his mood. The blue- haired head is his happiness and loyalty, the red-haired head is his sadness and fear, while the green-haired head is his anger and pure evil. =Yikka= Yikka (Jicha) is a female hinny who acts as Bastian's steed during the second half of the novel. She is quite faithful to him, but under Xayide's influence Bastian allows her to leave his side to start a family with an attractive male pegasus. =Yor= Yor is the picture miner of Yor's Minroud, a mine from which he excavates dream pictures (which make up the soil of Fantastica), who helps Bastian find his lost dream. Fantastican creatures The following is a list of creatures appearing in the different media adaptations of The Neverending Story: * Acharis ‚Äî Worm-like creatures so ashamed by their own ugliness that they hide underground and constantly cry. Their acidic tears eat away the soil around them, allowing them to mine Fantastican silver, which they use to construct beautiful buildings. Bastian pities them and transforms them into the Shlamoofs: anarchist, clown-faced flying creatures who destroy all of the work they did as Acharis. They pursue Bastian and demand that he becomes their leader, but they are driven off by Atreyu and Falkor. * Four Winds Giants ‚Äî Four giants who guard the winds of Fantastica. They constantly fight with each other, which causes the separation of Atreyu and Falkor in the novel. The four of them by name are: Lirr, the black North Wind, Sheerek, the sulfur-yellow South Wind, Baureo, the leaden-gray East Wind, and Mayestri, the fiery-red West Wind. Uncharacteristically silenced by AURYN, it is through the Wind Giants that Atreyu learns that Fantastica has no boundary. In the film, they are ultimately replaced by the Nothing. * Greenskins ‚Äî Also known as the Grass People, these are Atreyu's people, a folk of hunters and gatherers with a culture and lifestyle very similar to the North American Plains Indians. As their name implies, their skin is of an olive-green hue, and their hair is blueish-black. Their home is the Grassy Sea, a vast prairie in an undisclosed part of Fantastica bordered by the Silver Mountains range. * Iceheads ‚Äî A race of creatures which reside in the Mountains of Fate, where the Childlike Empress encounters the Old Man of Wandering Mountain. They are described as giant humanoids covered in (or made of) ice who move so slowly that a single footstep takes years to complete. As a result, they are fairly isolated even from their own kind and more so from any other living creature in Fantastica. Their original German name - Eisbolde - is an amalgam of the German words \\"Eis\\" (ice) and \\"kobold\\". * Nighthobs ‚Äî The Nighthobs are a race of nocturnal humanoids that live in the southern regions of Fantastica. They have sharp features, wild hair, and wear drab clothing. Nighthobs are known to employ large bats that they fly much like a hang glider. The most notable of the Nighthobs was Vooshvazool, who was sent on the mission to the Ivory Tower. * Rockbiters ‚Äî Large rock creatures that eat rocks and delight in different geological varieties. Rockbiters are often seen riding stone bicycles. Despite their gargantuan size and intimidating appearance, Rockbiters are generally kind and concerned with the well-being of Fantasticans smaller than themselves. * Sassafranians ‚Äî A race of humanoids who are born elderly. Their physical age regresses as they advance in years, and they die when they reach infancy state. * Tinys ‚Äî A race of tiny people that ride on racing snails. They are quite sophisticated, but due to their size they live in trees, erecting entire villages whose dwellings are connected by a huge number of ladders, slides and stairways. * Unlucky the Rabbit ‚Äî Large rabbits that are often victims of Rock Biter's bikes. * Ysk√°lnari ‚Äî A race of humanoid people living at the edge of a sea of mist, which can be navigated only by boats fashioned from special reeds and which are propelled by willpower. In the animated series, the Ysk√°lnari are depicted as seal-like humanoids manning conventional wooden ships which can navigate the Mist Sea. The following creatures appear in the first film in the Childlike Empress' throne room when Cairon mentions her illness, and are unnamed:http://www.cinema52.com/2013/01/08/creatures-great-and-small/ * Big- Headed Rock Creatures ‚Äî A race of creatures made of rock that have big heads. * Bird Humans ‚Äî A race of bird-headed humans. * Elephant-Headed Creature ‚Äî A humanoid elephant. * Four-Faced People ‚Äî A race of humans who have four faces. * Monkey-Headed Creature ‚Äî A creature with a monkey head. * Palm-Topped Creatures ‚Äî A race of humanoids with palm tree-like growths on top of their heads. * Three-Headed Creature ‚Äî A creature that has an unspecified head, a wolf head, and a goat head. * Two-Faced People ‚Äî A race of humans with two faces that have two noses, two mouths, and three eyes.

The film features an ensemble cast of Manoj Bajpayee, Ravi Kishan, Piyush Mishra, Deepak Dobriyal and others. At the 55th National Film Awards, it won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi The film is an account of the escape of six soldiers of the Indian Army taken as prisoners of war by Pakistan Army, during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 that was preceded by rebellion of East Pakistan(now Bangladesh) to separate itself from West Pakistan(now Pakistan) and create a new country.

They steal a guard's wallet and get a Pakistani army ID card on the way. The POWs realize that they are in a place less than 200 km from the Indo-Pak border. (The place, it is revealed later, is Chaklala.) When Colonel Puri is told of this and the idea of an escape is put forward, he overrules it. His reasons are that perhaps they will finally be repatriated and that a failed attempt could result in all of them being killed. Colonel Shakoor arrives at the Chaklala camp; he informs Colonel Puri and Major Singh that all the POWs will be repatriated.

According to the Hawaii Greenpeace Foundation's 1979 leader, Don White, the Hawaii group impacted public education, influenced legislation, and was active on press public relations, yet paid its members \\"virtually nothing in the way of salaries\\", making Hawaii \\"a real Greenpeace group.\\" Greenpeace Foundation (Vancouver) The greenpeace movement grew out of the \\"peace\\" and \\"environmental\\" movements in the early 1970s. Back then, it looked likely that the planet was going to be subjected to a nuclear war. The Canadian \\"Don't Make a Wave\\" committee formed to protest US tectonic nuclear testing at Amchitka in the Aleutian Islands and later the French atmospheric testing at Mururoa in French Polynesia. The phrase \\"green peace\\" was used as a slogan to describe the ideals of those activists, who envisioned a healthy (green) and peaceful (peace) planet as a good thing. By about 1973, the phrase had been shortened to a word, Greenpeace, and an organization called \\"Greenpeace Foundation\\" was established in Vancouver, Canada.

The character has appeared in both live action and animated television series and films, as well as in video games in her alter-egos as both Batgirl and Oracle. Film =Live- action= In 1997, Alicia Silverstone portrayed Barbara Wilson/Batgirl in the film Batman & Robin. Unlike in the comics, this version of Barbara is not James Gordon's daughter, but Alfred Pennyworth's niece. Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman said this change was done because Alfred was more central of a character than Jim Gordon was in their story. She is depicted as a blonde instead of a red-head in the comics. Barbara's Batgirl suit in the film is completely different than the one from the comics as it lacks gold accents and had a Robin-style domino mask. Like Batman and Robin, she also had a silvery arctic version of her suit with a cowl (similar to the one in the comics) in which she briefly wears. In 2008, Hannah Gunn briefly portrayed \\"Gordon's Daughter\\" in The Dark Knight, credited as such, as she is not named in the film. In March 2017, it was announced that Joss Whedon was in talks to write, direct and produce a Batgirl film as part of the DC Extended Universe. The film will feature the Barbara Gordon incarnation of the character, with The New 52 comics by Gail Simone serving as \\"a starting point\\" for the film. In April 2017, Whedon stated that he was fascinated by a character that chooses to be a vigilante, even though she hadn't suffered any tragedies in her life like Bruce Wayne/Batman and that the damaged aspect of the character will be explored in the film. In July, Geoff John's stated production on the film would begin in 2018. At San Diego Comic Con 2017, the title was announced to be Batgirl. Whedon was to begin production on the film in 2018, but stepped down in February 2018. In April 2018, after impressing the studio with her work on Birds of Prey, Christina Hodson was hired as screenwriter for Batgirl as well. The studio is actively looking for a female director. While there's no word on an actress and a director, Karen Gillan revealed that wants to not only star as Batgirl but also wanted to direct the film as well. =Animation= Batman: Under the Red Hood Barbara Gordon is directly alluded to in Batman: Under the Red Hood when Jason Todd mentions \\"the friends the Joker has crippled\\" to Batman, most likely referencing to the night the Joker shot her to drive James Gordon insane. Batman: Bad Blood Barbara Gordon made a brief cameo in her \\"Batgirl of Burnside\\" costume at end of Batman: Bad Blood. LEGO DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League: Gotham City Breakout Batgirl appears in LEGO DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League - Gotham City Breakout, voiced by Sarah Hyland. Batman: The Killing Joke Tara Strong reprised her role as Barbara Gordon for the animated film adaptation of Batman: The Killing Joke. Her Batgirl costume resembles the one from The New Batman Adventures and her debut appearance in Detective Comics #359. Batgirl's role in the film was expanded from the source material, including depicting her decision to retire as Batgirl just before the Joker's attack after a tense case with a ruthless gang leader, as well as an encounter with Batman that ended with them having sex. There is also a post-credits scene where Barbara, some time after recovering in the hospital, now operates as Oracle. Barbara's role and portrayal in the film (which differs heavily from most other portrayals) has been heavily criticized as \\"cheap, misogynistic writing\\". The LEGO Batman Movie Rosario Dawson voiced Barbara Gordon in The LEGO Batman Movie.http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat- vision/lego-batman-rosario-dawson-plat-832508 This incarnation is the new Police Commissioner of the Gotham City Police Department after her father retires. But when the Joker causes chaos around the city and releases a few major non-DC comics villains from the Phantom Zone, Barbara helps Batman, Robin, and Alfred recapture the villains, and later on after she and the gang team up with the original Joker Gang, Barbara becomes Batgirl. Her Batgirl costume is purple with gold accents to reflect the costume from the '60s TV series. Batman and Harley Quinn In Batman and Harley Quinn, a waitress wearing an exotic version of Batgirl's costume makes a cameo appearance. Scooby-Doo! & Batman: The Brave and the Bold In the 2018 animated crossover film Scooby-Doo! & Batman: The Brave and the Bold, near the plot's climax Daphne Blake dons an old Batgirl costume which - with the mask and hood up - makes her strongly resemble Batgirl from the Batman: The Brave and the Bold animated series as well as Batgirl's appearance from her debut in Detective Comics #359 and in the Silver Age comics. Teen Titans Go! To the Movies Batgirl makes a silent cameo appearance in the movie. Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles In the 2019 crossover film Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Batgirl (voiced by Rachel Bloom) plays an important role as both a scientist and a crime-fighter. She encounters the Turtles during a robbery by the Foot Clan and mistakenly believes that they are the thieves. She later forms a close bond with Donatello, working on a retromutagen with him and later accompanying him through Arkham Asylum. Batman: Hush Peyton R. List voices Barbara Gordon / Batgirl in the animated Batman: Hush film. Justice League Dark: Apokolips War Batgirl has a non-speaking role in Justice League Dark: Apokolips War. In the film, she is seen fighting against Apokolips' forces alongside Batwoman before getting gruesomely dismembered by the Paradooms, Darkseid's newest henchman force. Television =Live-action= Batman Librarian Barbara Gordon and her alter ego Batgirl were portrayed by Yvonne Craig in the third season of the Batman television series (1967‚Äì1968), where she appeared in all 26 episodes. Months before her debut, Barbara Gordon had been discussed by her father and Batman in the second-season episodes, \\"Batman's Waterloo\\" and \\"The Duo Defy\\". Her Batgirl costume color was purple with gold accents and it also incorporated a long red wig to hide her real avocado-style, black hair. In a promotional short, librarian Barbara Gordon encounters millionaire Bruce Wayne and his \\"youthful ward\\" Dick Grayson at the Gotham City Public Library. As Gordon and Wayne become acquainted, Killer Moth and his henchmen (in full costume) discuss a plan of attack. One henchman suggests taking Bruce Wayne hostage, but Killer Moth shows reluctance, due to Wayne's alleged friendship with Batman. Moth directs the group to kidnap Wayne's business acquaintance instead, who also happens to be a billionaire. When Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson realize the presence of their adversaries, they quickly leave the library to change into Batman and Robin. alt=Yvonne Craig poses in the Batgirl costume from the television show, holding the cape open. The costume consists of a purple bodysuit, cowl, gloves, boots, a yellow cape and belt. Meanwhile, Gordon is locked in the library's office by Killer Moth's henchmen, however, it is revealed there is a secret chamber within the office where she changes into Batgirl. When Batman and Robin arrive to apprehend Moth and his gang, all parties are shocked at the arrival of a Batgirl. Batman, Robin, and Batgirl defeat the villains with relative ease and Batgirl vanishes without revealing her secret identity. Batgirl's costume in the episode closely resembles that later seen in the series, though the design of her mask changes. The short also featured a unique version of the Batman theme, ending with the lyric \\"Batgirl!\\" rather than the usual \\"Batman!\\" (and accompanied by an appropriately modified Batman logo). The promotional short was able to renew the series for a third season and add Batgirl to its regular cast. Batgirl's official debut was in the episode \\"Enter Batgirl, Exit Penguin\\". The Penguin kidnaps Commissioner Gordon's daughter Barbara, binds her to a chair and gags her, and hides her in the next-door apartment which is being redecorated. The dynamic duo make it their mission to rescue her. The Penguin plans to marry her, thinking that becoming Commissioner Gordon's son-in-law would make him immune from arrest. He ungags her and forces her to agree to this by threatening to have Gordon killed. Pretending to be locked behind a secured door, Barbara makes her transformation into Batgirl and assists Batman and Robin in defeating the Penguin as they have been gassed and hung over a vat of acid. During the episode, Alfred Pennyworth discovers her secret identity - but he vows never to reveal it. He claims she left a few minutes ago when the fight has finished, by which time Barbara has changed back. During the third season, Batgirl aided Batman and Robin in solving several mysteries and even saved them from near death by herself on several occasions. Unfortunately, Batgirl's addition to the cast was not enough to save the series from cancellation. Although the promotional short has been mistakenly thought of as a pilot for Batgirl's own spin-off, it is highly unlikely ABC would have agreed to give her own series since Batman had been in danger of cancellation since the end of its first season. According to the book DC Comics: Sixty Years of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes, Batgirl's addition to the cast \\"was a sign of desperation. Ratings were down and there was hope that a new character might give the show a shot in the arm.\\" Yvonne Craig once again appeared as Batgirl in a 1972 television commercial supporting women's rights (specifically, equal pay). The 2003 made-for-TV film Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt included scenes recreating the filming of the 1960s TV series. Erin Carufel plays Yvonne Craig / Batgirl, in the film. Birds of Prey Barbara Gordon appeared as Oracle as one of the main characters in the WB television series Birds of Prey, played by Dina Meyer. The series was loosely based on the comic book of the same name. alt=Dina Meyer as Barbara Gordon from the television series Birds of Prey.In the 70 minute pilot episode, Alfred Pennyworth narrates the events which have led to the formation of the Birds of Prey. Years ago, when Batman defended the streets of Gotham City, he fathered a daughter to Catwoman which he never knew about. After the birth of her daughter Helena, Selena Kyle gave up her life as Catwoman and raised her child as a single mother. Bruce Wayne, apparently oblivious to the fact that he has a child, continues to fight crime in Gotham as Batman. Alfred tells that he \\"had trained many prot√©g√©s over the years and one of them was Barbara Gordon, who called herself Batgirl.\\" As Batman and Batgirl continued to fight the Joker for control of the city, the battle came to an end with Joker's loss. However, the Joker swore revenge not on Batman himself, but on those he loved. While a hit-man was sent to murder Catwoman, the Joker, in a scene adapted directly from The Killing Joke, guns down Barbara at her apartment. With Gordon paralyzed and Kyle dead, Batman abandons Gotham, never to be seen again. Seven years later, in the present day, Barbara Gordon has now become \\"Oracle\\" and has adopted and trained Helena Kyle; the vigilante known as The Huntress. They soon adopt Dinah Redmond and the three vow to protect the city of New Gotham. During the series, Oracle is briefly reunited with Black Canary, described as her original partner in Birds of Prey (and the mother of Dinah Redmond), and in one episode dons the Batgirl costume once more in order to face off with Lady Shiva (while using an electronic device that allows her to temporarily walk again). In the final episode, she is able to improve her spine replacement device enough to engage in combat for several minutes though she collapses at the end of the battle. The series would last a total of thirteen episodes, leaving the mystery of Batman's whereabouts unresolved. However, a phone conversation with Alfred in Wayne Manor implies that the Dark Knight has monitored Birds of Prey activities in the city and knows of his daughter's existence. Laeta Kalogridis planned several series highlights for the second season, including Dick Grayson's reintroduction (prompting a Barbara/Helena argument), as well as Koriand'r possibly appearing. Ollie Queen/Green Arrow would have joined Dinah, and thus the series would have progressed with a Cassandra Cain episode as well. Dina Meyer additionally reprises her role as Barbara Gordon in a vocal capacity in the Arrowverse crossover event \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\". Arrow Barbara Gordon's Oracle persona was briefly mentioned in the Arrow episode \\"A.W.O.L,\\" where Oliver mentions that the reason he didn't choose Oracle as Felicity Smoak's codename is because it was taken, referencing Barbara Gordon and even possibly Batman's existence in the Arrowverse. Titans Barbara Gordon was mentioned in the Titans episode ‚ÄúDick Grayson‚Äù, where Jason Todd lists her as one of the many people who has stated that Bruce Wayne was never the same after Grayson stopped being his partner. She is later mentioned by Dawn Granger when she lists those who were once close to Bruce, stating that she is missing after her father's death at the hands of the Joker. These references suggest that Gordon is or has been Batgirl within this universe as she knew of Grayson's close relationship with Bruce as Batman and Robin and has a close connection to both. Executive producers Greg Walker and Akiva Goldsman have both stated that despite being part of the original planned cast for the series before it was created for the DC Universe streaming service, they are currently unable to use Gordon's character on the show, but remain eager to include her if ever possible. Due to this, many iconic scenarios related to Gordon have been used within the series without her character being involved; Grayson's complicated on/off romantic history with Granger, created specifically for the show, is reminiscent of his and Gordon's, suggesting that Granger's character to an extent is filling the role that the writers planned for Gordon. Todd being paralysed from the waist down by a super villain and placed into a wheelchair also reflects Gordon's own disability within the comic books and mirrors how she too was shot within The Killing Joke storyline. Likewise, her father being abused and photographed by the Joker is something that happened to her within the former storyline, too. It was announced that Barbara will appear in season 3 as the Commissioner of the Gotham City Police Department. Gotham Barbara Gordon, renamed Barbara Lee Gordon, appears in the fifth and final season of Gotham, portrayed by Jet√© Laurence. =Animation= The Adventures of Batman The Barbara Gordon version of Batgirl made her first animated appearance in the 1968 series The Adventures of Batman. Jane Webb provided her voice. Her Batgirl costume is now a gray bodysuit (similar to Batman's) along with gold colored gloves, boots, bat-symbol and utility belt while her blue cape and cowl from the comics is retained. Also, the colors of the costume from the show are later adopted in the Bronze Age comics from the 1970s through the early 1980s. Barbara Gordon, this time working in the District Attorney's office instead of being a librarian, made several appearances in both her civilian persona and as her alter ego in the 1977 Saturday morning animated series The New Adventures of Batman. Adam West and Burt Ward reprised their roles to provide the voices for Batman and Robin, but Jane Webb was replaced by Melendy Britt for the voice of Batgirl. Super Friends Although not appearing in the television show, Batgirl does appear in some of the merchandise produced for the show using her design from The Adventures of Batman and the Bronze Age comics. DC Animated Universe Barbara Gordon has appeared in Bruce Timm's DC animated universe, with Batgirl voiced by Melissa Gilbert in Batman: The Animated Series, by Mary Kay Bergman in the animated movie Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero, by Tara Strong for The New Batman Adventures, Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman and Gotham Girls, and by Stockard Channing during the first two seasons of Batman Beyond and by Angie Harmon during the last season of Batman Beyond and Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker. =Batman: The Animated Series= Barbara Gordon as Batgirl in alt= Typical depiction of Batgirl from Batman: The Animated Series: grey body-suit; blue scalloped gloves, cowl, and cape; yellow belt and bat-emblem. In Batman: The Animated Series, Barbara Gordon is introduced in the two-part episode \\"Heart of Steel\\", where she assists Batman in saving her father James Gordon from the evil A.I. supercomputer HARDAC (although Fox Kids' original broadcast order has her first appearance in the episode \\"I Am the Night\\"). She makes her first appearance as Batgirl in the two-part episode \\"Shadow of the Bat\\" in which Commissioner Gordon is framed for corruption. Barbara asks Batman to appear at a public rally to support Gordon but the Dark Knight declines, citing more important things to do in investigating who framed Gordon. Barbara then decides to impersonate Batman at the rally, intending only to be seen in the shadows. But when there is a drive-by shooting, she leaps into action to assist. Robin appears as well and attempts to grab her, accidentally ripping the back of her mask which causes her hair to spill out. When media articles the next day ask the question \\"Who is Batgirl?\\", Barbara decides she can accomplish her goal with greater ease as Batgirl than as a civilian and redesigns her costume as a more contrast from Batman's. Her Batgirl costume is exactly the same from The Adventures of Batman and from the Bronze Age comics, but with blue gloves and boots instead of yellow ones to reflect Batman's costume while retaining the same gold bat-symbol and utility belt from the comics. She discovers that Gill Mason of the GCPD (under Two-Face's orders) is behind the frame-up and goes to rescue her father, only to complicate the rescue already underway by Batman and Robin. In the end, Batgirl is the one who captures Mason. Although Batman had been critical of her at first, the Dark Knight changes this thinking after witnessing her capabilities. Barbara's final appearance is in the episode \\"Batgirl Returns\\" in which she is seen having a flirting relationship with her classmate Dick Grayson at Gotham State University. In the movie Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero, Barbara Gordon appears a central character and her age is revealed to be 20. She is first seen wearing her Batgirl costume while fighting a thug. She is then kidnapped by an associate of Mr. Freeze because she is an exact match for a transplant needed to save Nora Fries. The bulk of the film showcases Barbara using her skills to evade Mr. Freeze while trying to escape her captor's hideout. Despite being against Mr. Freeze, Barbara admits that she feels sorry for Nora and is willing to do the transfusion but only in a hospital. Eventually, Batman and Robin locate her, and the three of them manage to destroy Mr. Freeze's hideout and escape. It's also shown in this film that Barbara is in a relationship with Dick. =The New Batman Adventures= alt=Batgirl as depicted in The New Batman Adventures: Black bodysuit and cowl; yellow bat emblem, belt, scalloped gloves, boots, and cape lining; blue cape; and red hair. During The New Batman Adventures, Barbara Gordon appears as Batgirl as a recurring character. Batgirl is eventually allowed into the Batcave and becomes a main character and is Batman's main partner. Batgirl was made an addition to the cast with producer Bruce Timm stating, \\"The consumer products division and the people at the WB wanted to make sure kids would watch the show, so they strongly suggested we include Batgirl and Tim Drake (as Robin) as a way of courting young girl audiences as well as young boys...We liked the Batgirl character and I certainly didn't mind putting her in the show.\\" It is also shown in the series that her previous relationship with Dick Grayson did not last. The episode \\"You Scratch My Back\\" emphasized this, portraying her relationship with Nightwing as strenuous and the episode \\"Old Wounds\\" shows how it ended with Barbara eventually discovering Bruce and Dick's secret identities and Dick realizing that Bruce knew and never told him quits as Robin and leaves Gotham. The episode \\"Over the Edge\\" also implies this as Nightwing \\"can't believe it ended like this for us or Barbara\\". The episode \\"Girls' Night Out\\" establishes Batgirl and Supergirl (Kara Kent) as close friends. Along with all other characters in the series, Barbara's civilian and superhero identity were redesigned. Her Batgirl costume was changed to a black body suit with yellow gloves, boots, bat-symbol and utility belt to match her original comic book design seen in Detective Comics #359. In the movie Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman, Barbara Gordon appears briefly when she calls Bruce Wayne to find out who Batwoman is. She expresses jealousy and Bruce dodges the issue by faking cellular phone problems. This is Barbara's only scene in the film and hints a crush on Bruce which she expresses with hinting that she misses Bruce. =Batman Beyond= Barbara Gordon as she appears in Batman Beyond. Barbara Gordon appears in Batman Beyond. No longer the dashing beautiful vigilante she was in her youth, this version is a grim, bitter old woman that is the Police Commissioner. Her history is also a little revised: she and Bruce Wayne developed a romantic relationship at one point, after Dick Grayson had left, stating that \\"on the streets it was like ballet\\" but that \\"eventually it gets old\\" and she left, later thinking \\"[she doesn't] hate [Bruce]. [She hates] what [Bruce's] become. Such a great man - so alone.\\". Despite that she and Bruce are no longer together, she does care and wishes for Bruce to be happy. She resents Wayne dragging Terry McGinnis as a new Batman as she believes Bruce did with all of his previous partners. Unlike her father, she states that vigilante justice \\"went out with the tommy gun\\" and insists Terry to give up being Batman. But she develops respect for the new Batman, assisting her in defending her husband Gotham District Attorney Sam Young from assassin Curar√©. While she never officially endorses or helps him (as she never uses a Bat-Signal), she no longer threatens to turn him in and continually looks the other way, acknowledging his assistance in some cases even if she never asks for it. On one occasion, she was prepared to arrest Terry when she apparently witnessed the second Batman murder the criminal bomber Mad Stan despite the fact that Terry's arrest would compromise her and Bruce's secret. However, Bruce and Terry succeeded in revealing that Spellbinder had simply created an illusion of Mad Stan's death; she subsequently awarded Terry with a civic service award as an apology. The precise future of her and Dick's relationship remains unknown but Barbara tells Terry to \\"try looking up for Nightwing sometime\\" about how Bruce treated partners. In the movie Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker, Barbara Gordon appears as a supporting character. When the Joker returns from the dead, Terry McGinnis goes to her when Bruce Wayne refuses to talk about how this cannot be the Clown Price of Crime. When Bruce is recovering from the Joker's toxin, she reluctantly tells Terry the details: the Joker kidnapped, tortured and brainwashed Tim Drake into a miniature version of the Clown Prince of Crime. During the chaos, Batgirl faced off against Harley Quinn and watched as Harley fell to an apparent death. Tim killed the Joker who was buried under Arkham Asylum and covered up the events with her father's aid a year before Tim's recovery from his trauma and Bruce forbade Tim from being Robin again as Tim soon left after this. Barbara also temporarily takes Bruce's place in advising Terry while tracking a couple of suspects as possible candidates for the Joker's true identity. At the conclusion of the film, she and Bruce visit Tim recovering in the hospital after the Joker's final defeat by Terry with Bruce reconciling his relationship with Tim. =Gotham Girls= Barbara Gordon is also a featured character in the Flash animated web series Gotham Girls (2002). A joint production of Warner Bros. and Noodle Soup Productions, the series stars Batgirl protecting Gotham City from the criminal activities of Catwoman, Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn. Although not restricted to the animated continuity, the main characters were adapted from The New Batman Adventures. =Justice League= The character also made several brief cameo appearances in the Justice League animated series. While the Bat Embargo forbade the use of her character for the majority of the time, she appears in the episode \\"The Savage Time\\" [Pt. I] in the alternate timeline where she can be seen kissing Dick Grayson (as confirmed by the show's producers) and mentioned briefly in the episode \\"Comfort and Joy\\". Barbara Gordon was originally planned to appear in Justice League Unlimited. The episode \\"Double Date\\" (scripted by Birds of Prey author Gail Simone) would have also featured Oracle's animated debut. But due to the restrictions on Batman-related characters, she was replaced with Green Arrow and the Question. The Batman The Batman version of Barbara Gordon as Batgirl alongside Batman. Art by Jeff Matsuda.alt=Batgirl drops in front of a charging Batman. The art for the comic book uses the same style as the animation for The Batman. Unlike previous Batman series, this version is established as Batman's first official sidekick instead of Dick Grayson which was also different from the comics. Barbara Gordon appears on The Batman animated series, with Batgirl voiced by Danielle Judovits, and Oracle voiced by Kellie Martin. She replaced Ellen-Yin as Batman's female ally for Season three onward. Her Batgirl costume color is purple along with a black cape, cowl, gloves and boots with dark purple highlights (which is an homage to the Batgirl costume from the 60's TV series) along with a gold bat-symbol and utility belt and has white eye lenses for the first time. She also has brown eyes instead of green. She was first mentioned on the episode \\"Night and the City\\" and made her first appearance on the two-part episode \\"Batgirl Begins\\". This version is the teenage daughter of Gotham Police Commissioner Gordon and a student of Gotham High. Though an excellent gymnast, she has lost interest in gymnastics; however, her father wants her to continue in the hope she might attend an Olympic Games. Although not as interested in gymnastics, she finds police detective work fascinating - which worries her father. In addition to that, Barbara associates with her close friend Pamela Isley, a fellow student with a juvenile-detention record - something James does not like. During a battle with Temblor in the Chlorogene lab, Barbara sees Batman in action; after this, the seed to use her Batgirl persona is planted. The battle also causes Pamela to become the villainess Poison Ivy after an experimental plant mutagen fell upon her former friend. Batgirl arrives at Poison Ivy's lair to help Batman save Gordon (though she originally wanted to save her friend from getting into more trouble) only to find Batman under Poison Ivy's mind control. Batgirl is then forced to fight Batman. During the battle, she beat Batman in hand-to-hand combat by kicking the Dark Knight into a pond which freed Batman of Poison Ivy's control. After she defeated Poison Ivy and saved her father, Batman decides not to tell Gordon that his daughter is Batgirl. That first adventure, Batgirl says is 'only the beginning'. During her initial introduction, she demands to be called ‚ÄúBatwoman‚Äù until Commissioner Gordon calls her by the Batgirl name. She aids the Dark Knight with numerous cases, proving herself as a trusted ally. Batman himself, despite never asking to have a partner, becomes fond of working with her - though would not admit it. At one point, in the episode \\"A Dark Knight to Remember\\", she has figured out that Batman is secretly Bruce Wayne as the billionaire is physically fit and can afford to purchase equipment that Batman would require. But Wayne suffered partial amnesia during that time which made Bruce lose the memory as the Dark Knight Detective which threw Barbara off. After she and Batman saved Gotham from Maxie Zeus's siege in the episode \\"Thunder\\", the Dark Knight gave her some spare gadgets and accepted her as a partner as she was in the loop, marking the only time Batgirl is Batman's first sidekick instead of Robin, which was different from the comics due to having Robin's character in another DC animated television series. Batman finally let Barbara in on his own secret in the episode \\"Team Penguin\\" after getting Dick Grayson as a second partner. Deciding they needed teamwork training and to learn to trust one another more, the trio shares their secret identities (but Batgirl is reluctant to give up hers so Batman does it for her) and begins training. She and Robin develop a sibling-like relationship throughout the show, and gets annoyed when Robin refers to her as \\"Babs\\". In the two-part episode \\"The Joining\\", she participated in the battle to save Earth with Robin from the alien technological entity known as The Joining. The episode \\"Artifacts\\" features her adult incarnation using a wheelchair (under unknown circumstances) using her Oracle identity. Oracle manages the cyber realms and has a joking yet more adult-like relationship to Nightwing. The distant future shows Batgirl, Batman and Robin are now legends similar to Robin Hood and the Merry Men and she's also known in these stories as Batwoman. In the episode \\"Joker Express\\", Batgirl was under the Joker's control and Batman and Robin have perforce to fight her. While Robin was almost killed, Batman fought Batgirl briefly. The Dark Knight defeated her by making Barbara inhale an incapacitating gas which eventually restores her to normal after her body and mind begin to relax. In the episode \\"Attack of the Terrible Trio\\", it is revealed that Barbara has graduated from Gotham High School at an early age and enrolled in Gotham University. In the two-part series finale, Barbara and Robin once again join the battle against The Joining with the Justice League after they lost their powers. After The Joining is once again defeated, she and Robin discuss the idea of forming their own junior Justice League. Batman: The Brave and The Bold The Barbara Gordon incarnation of Batgirl appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by Mae Whitman. Her Batgirl costume is exactly the same in the comics and her debut in Detective Comics #359. In the teaser of the episode \\"The Last Patrol!\\", she saves Batman from Killer Moth in a flashback. In a present-day scene of the teaser, she and Batman end up in one of the Penguin's death traps. She returns in the episode \\"The Criss Cross Conspiracy!\\" in which she and Nightwing have to work alongside Batman (in Batwoman's body) and Felix Faust to save Batwoman (in Batman's body) at the mercy of the Riddler. Additionally, the fourth wall-breaking series finale \\"Mitefall!\\" sees Bat-Mite altering reality in order to make Batman: The Brave and the Bold \\"jump the shark\\" so that it will be cancelled and replaced with a more serious Batman series. In the end, he succeeds, and an in-universe commercial for the (fictional) replacement series reveals that the new show will focus on Batgirl instead, with Batman as a supporting character. Ambush Bug then compounds Bat- Mite's initial disappointment by pointing out that a darker, more serious series like the Batgirl show he has just instigated would not use a character as silly as Bat-Mite, leading the anti-hero to disappear into nothingness just before the end of the episode. Young Justice Barbara Gordon appears in the Young Justice animated series, voiced by Alyson Stoner. In the episode \\"Homefront\\", she is portrayed as a student at the Gotham Academy alongside Dick Grayson and Artemis Crock. She also had a cameo appearance in the episode \\"Failsafe\\" of standing in the crowd with Alfred Pennyworth. In Young Justice: Invasion, Batgirl has joined the Team during the five-year gap. She helps Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark) rescue U.N. Secretary General Tseng from Lobo. Her Batgirl costume is a gray bodysuit with black accents to mirror that of Batman's. In the episode \\"Alienated\\", she had a cameo with the rest of the Bat-Family invading a Krolotean facility. Batgirl returns in the episode \\"Beneath\\" as part of a team sent to investigate The Light's activities in Bialya. In the tie-in comics, she's shown to have a romantic interest in Dick Grayson, and appears to have a \\"friends with benefits\\" relationship.Greg Weisman (2013). Young Justice #25.

She attempts to try to help out by stealing a police van and attempting to use the computers in it. Her father catches her, but eventually agrees to help her. Batman gives her the password to the Cortex (\\"Oracle\\") so she can hack it and take it down. The following episode, \\"Reckoning\\", forces her and her dad to infiltrate the lair of Ra's al Ghul to take down the Cortex, saving Gotham City in the process. After the black-out, she continues to assist Katana and Batman, taking the codename of Oracle. In \\"Alone\\", she joins other Outsiders such as Metamorpho and Man-Bat in assisting in the final battle against Deathstroke. Teen Titans Go! Batgirl makes appearances in the Teen Titans Go! animated series, voiced by Tara Strong once again. She makes a cameo appearance at Titans East's party in the episode \\"Starliar\\" when seen dancing next to Aqualad before Robin obnoxiously cuts in. She is later seen in the episode \\"Staring at the Future\\" shown to be the future wife of Nightwing and the mother of their three babies.

She is also a creative problem solver and will use her creativity and her surprisingly analytical thinking to stop the bad guys and be the glue in her friendships. She is similar to Tigger, a character from Winnie The Pooh, in terms of being bouncy, pouncy, fun-loving.

At the 2016 census, the locality had a population of 581 of which 419 lived in its town centre. Originally named \\"Beautiful Valley\\", Wilmington is a farming community, known for sheep, wheat and barley, but more recently the temperature conditions and rainfall have contributed to the increasing popularity of the planting of olive groves. The town has a post office, hotel, two caravan parks, take-away shop, two service stations, primary school, kindergarten, museum and op shop. It borders the Mount Remarkable National Park and the Alligator Gorge is a 10-minute drive from Wilmington. Wilmington is a popular place to stay due to its proximity to the tourist areas of the Flinders Ranges, most notably Wilpena Pound. Wilmington was established as a stop over route for grain and wool being delivered by horse and cart from Port Augusta on its way to Adelaide. The historic Wilmington Coaching Stables on Fourth Street survive and are listed on the South Australian Heritage Register. The town and surrounding areas formerly had their own municipality, the District Council of Wilmington, which merged into the current District Council of Mount Remarkable in 1980. Transport Wilmington was the northern terminus of the Wilmington railway line from 1915 when the line was built until it closed in 1969. Wilmington is on the Horrocks Highway at the junction where Main North Road turns west to pass through Horrocks Pass, and Horrocks Highway continues north to Quorn, South Australia. South of Wilmington, the same road carries both names to Gawler on the northern outskirts of Adelaide.

Harvey was the eldest son of Captain John Harvey who was a distinguished officer of the eighteenth century who was killed in action at the battle of the Glorious First of June. Early career Born in 1772 at Eastry, Kent to Captain Harvey and Judith Harvey n√©e Wise, Harvey was raised with his brothers at home and in the 1780s joined his uncle Captain Henry Harvey's ship HMS Rose off the North American station to train as a midshipman. His service continued until 1790 when at 18 he was promoted to lieutenant. Actively employed at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, Harvey was aided by family influence and gained command of the sloop HMS Actif on 5 September 1794 in the West Indies. Within three months, supported by the influence gained from his father's death at the Glorious First of June in the same year, Harvey was made post-captain, receiving promotion on 16 December.Harvey, Sir John, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J. K. Laughton, Retrieved 24 November 2007 His brother Edward Harvey also received promotion to midshipman at the same time. Thanks to family influence Harvey gained a prime commission in January 1795, serving aboard his uncle's flagship the second-rate HMS Prince of Wales as captain. In her, Harvey was extensively engaged during the following year, seeing action at the victory of the Battle of Groix where three enemy ships were taken and supporting the invasion of Quiberon Bay by Sir John Brolase Warren in 1796. In early 1797 Harvey followed his uncle to Trinidad, and supported the invasion of the island, helping capture it and the Spanish force there. Harvey was chosen to be sent home with the dispatches telling of the victory. Not long after arriving in England, Harvey married his first cousin in Sandwich, Kent. Napoleonic Wars During the next few years Harvey commanded several ships, including the frigates and HMS Amphitrite in the West Indies and as part of the Cadiz blockade. Benefiting from the Navy reforms surrounding the Peace of Amiens, Harvey took command of in which he participated in Sir Robert Calder's action at the Battle of Cape Finisterre in 1805, part of the prelude to the Battle of Trafalgar which Harvey narrowly missed. At Finisterre Harvey's ship suffered only three wounded and he left the ships to take over . Thus it was Sir Edward Berry who led Agamemnon at Trafalgar a few months later. During the next eight years, Harvey fulfilled the blockade duties of any captain of a ship of the line, not achieving any major victories but steadily doing his duty with quiet success. From Canada, Harvey moved first to and then , a first rate on which he was promoted to rear admiral in December 1813. Flag rank limited Harvey's employment prospects and it was not until the war was over that he was actively employed again, becoming commander-in-chief of the Leeward Islands Station between 1816 and 1818. In 1819, Harvey retired and settled in Deal, Kent with his wife and daughter, Elizabeth Harvey, to lead a quiet life of the gentry. Promotions and honours steadily increased over the years, Harvey adding to the Companion of the Order of the Bath he had received in 1815 with elevation to Knight Commander in 1833 and promotion to vice-admiral in 1825 and full admiral just weeks before his death in January 1837. Harvey died on 17 February 1837 at his home in Deal.

It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Anna ≈†i≈°kov√° won a Lion award for best actress. Plot The film opens in 1939 Czechoslovakia. Horst, a Czech-German Nazi collaborator married to a German woman and co-worker of Josef, brings food to Josef and his wife Marie, who are Czechs. Josef hates the Nazis. When Josef finds David, who had escaped a concentration camp in occupied Poland after first being sent to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in northern Bohemia, Josef and Marie decide to hide him in their apartment. Horst makes an unannounced visit, bringing presents as usual. Marie is ambivalent about their secret: On one hand she never misses an opportunity to blame her husband for bringing in the Jew, but on the other she is merciful and sympathetic towards the poor kid locked in the closet day and night. She suggests that Josef accepts Horst's job offer evicting Czech Jews from their homes, so as to get more protection and deflect possible suspicions. Josef accepts and is considered a collaborator by the neighbor Franta (who had tried to give David over to the Nazi authorities, when he first escaped from a concentration camp). Marie spends the days learning French from David and getting more and more tender toward him. Horst's visits become more frequent, and one afternoon, he attempts to rape Marie. Josef gets his fertility tested to confirm a long-time rumor: He can't have children. Humiliated by his earlier antics, Horst takes revenge on Marie by forcing them to provide lodging for his supervisor, a committed Nazi bureaucrat, who had suffered a stroke after Nazis kill his son for deserting the army. Marie refuses to accept him on the grounds that she is pregnant. Unfortunately, the community is well-aware that Josef and Marie are infertile, and Josef proposes that David get Marie pregnant in order to stage a \\"miracle\\" and avoid further investigation. After much resistance from Marie, she and David have sex. Marie becomes pregnant, and Horst eventually apologizes for his previous behavior. As the Germans lose ground in World War II, Horst's behavior begins to change. Based on his previous suspicions that someone else is living with Josef and Marie, he redirects German authorities when the latter search the street house by house. Finally, the Germans are defeated and the Czech people take brutal revenge on them. As the Germans are being driven out, Marie goes into labor. Josef frantically searches for a doctor, but the streets of the city are in chaos and the Nazi-affiliated doctor has already been captured. He finally finds the new ruling troika which includes his old neighbor Franta as the representative of the Czech Resistance. Unfortunately, Franta remembers him as a collaborator and orders his arrest. Josef protests his innocence and invites them to meet David as proof of his ambivalence towards the Jews, in exchange for a chance to find the Nazi doctor to deliver Marie's baby. In the jails, Josef finds that the doctor has committed suicide but also finds Horst crouched in a corner. Remembering Horst's previous actions that saved David's life, Josef tells the Czech partisan guards that Horst is his doctor. The partisans escort them to Josef's house, driving through the ruins of the city. Horst is able to quickly assume the role of Marie's doctor due to his experience delivering his own sons, much to Marie's initial horror. The partisans still want to see David in order to prove Josef's allegiance, but in the chaos and gunfire, David had hid himself elsewhere. The captain of the partisan unit, a member of the regular Czechoslovak Army, does not believe Josef's story and is about to shoot him, but David shows up at the last minute after Josef's despairing plea: \\"Let us be human!\\" After they all return to the household, Marie and David's son is born. The partisans interrogate David about Horst's background, but David, realizing that Horst had known about the situation for over two years and had not reported it, supports Josef's claim that Horst is a doctor and thus saves Horst's life as well. Days later, Josef walks the baby through the devastated streets of his city. In the ruins, he imagines David's deceased family and his supervisor's youngest son sitting around a small table, waving at him. Josef picks up David's son and waves his hand back. An aria from J.S. Bach's St Matthew Passion (Erbarme dich, mein Gott, God, please have mercy on our frailty!) is the denouement of the film.

Josef has had to collaborate with the Nazis to provide additional cover while hiding a Jew in his home; Horst has been a pro-German collaborator, but has also kept his old friend's secret, Marie has had to compromise herself for the sake of their safety, and even the anti-Nazi partisan Franta, now in a position of authority, had at one time tried to turn David over to the Germans. But by film's end the war is over and it is time to work toward reconciliation and rebuilding. Thus, while ostensibly about the Nazi occupation and its aftermath, \\"Divided We Fall\\" carried a similar message of reconciliation for the contemporary Czech Republic in the aftermath of Soviet occupation and domination. The imagery of the film is not even thinly disguised: Josef and Marie have a child that is savior (both for them and Horst), but Josef is not the father. It is a child of David. The birth is even attended by three \\"wise men\\": a Czech, a German, and a Russian.

Note a prisoner being brought in, in handcuffs Het Rasphuis in 1662. From: Melchior Fokkens, \\"Beschrijvinge der wijdt-vermaarde Koop-stadt Amstelredam\\" The Rasphuis gate today The Rasphuis was a \\"tuchthuis\\" or prison in Amsterdam that was established in 1596 in the former Convent of the Poor Clares on the Heiligeweg. In 1815 it was closed, and in 1892 the building was demolished to make way for a swimming pool. On the site today is the Kalvertoren shopping centre. The Rasphuis was a prison for young male criminals. Female criminals were sent to the Spinhuis. The detainees in the Rasphuis were made to shave wood from the brazilwood tree (Caesalpinia echinata or pernambuco), rasping it into powder using an eight to twelve bladed rasp, hence the name. The powder was delivered as a raw material to the paint industry where it was mixed with water, then boiled and oxidised to form a red pigment, also known as brazilwood which in turn was used as a textile dye. Founding The Rasphuis was founded after the torture of 16-year-old assistant tailor Evert Jansz. Jansz confessed, as a result of the torture, to theft on two occasions from his boss. The usual punishment for this was public flogging, but the city council decided to try to rehabilitate Jansz, who was from a good background. Under the influence of Dirck Volkertszoon Coornhert and C.P. Hooft the city decided, on 19 June 1589, to build a prison. Shortly after the opening, Jansz was sentenced to a light beating and forced labour; he never took the rasp. The founding of the Rasphuis signified a sea-change in Dutch correctional thinking. Until then it was universally believed that criminals needed to be punished. In the Rasphuis, the effort was made to instill a sense of order and duty into the young men. The Rasphuis was thus intended as an institute for rehabilitation. Over the entrance gate, which still stands, is the inscription 'Wilde beesten moet men temmen' or 'Wild beasts must be tamed'. There is a persistent myth that the Rasphuis contained a \\"water dungeon,\\" the so-called Waterhuis. If prisoners refused to work they were placed in a cellar that quickly filled with water after a sluice was opened; they were handed a pump that enabled them to keep from drowning, provided they pumped energetically and continuously. Geert Mak and other historians, however, point out that there is no evidence whatsoever for the existence of this room and this punishment. Exploitation Within a few years, however, the Rasphuis began to be exploited as a source of cheap labour and the rehabilitation goals envisaged by the founders were lost. More and more adults were incarcerated in the Rasphuis. A secret section was created where families could lock up uncontrollable or otherwise crazy relatives, at their own cost. These prisoners were seen as privileged due to the meals of dried fish, salted meat or bacon they received once a week as opposed to the standard menu of peas and pearl barley served to other inmates. At a fee, the Rasphuis could be visited, for example by families wishing to let their children see what would become of them if they were not well-behaved. For a long time, the Rasphuis had a monopoly in parts of the Netherlands for the processing of Brazilwood. A mill was built in Zaandam in 1601 to process Brazilwood, but this mill worked under the control of the Rasphuis. Inspectors worked in the Zaanstreek to ensure that the monopoly was adhered to. The quality and delivery from the Rasphuis left much to be desired however and, over time, this monopoly was weakened due to increased competition from other sources. During the French occupation of the Netherlands the cities lost their right to impose monopolies and this monopoly too, came to an end. In 1815 the Rasphuis was closed. The inside of the Rasphuis was depicted in a sketch by van Toornenbergen in 1799. Notes References University of Amsterdam. The Rasphuis (Library Exhibitions)(in Dutch).

From the left: John the Blind, his father Henry VII, Peter von Aspelt, Louis the Bavarian. Peter of Aspelt (aka Peter von Aichspelt, Peter von Basel, Peter von Mainz; born 1240/45, died June 5, 1320 in Mainz) was Archbishop of Mainz from 1306 to 1320,Imperial Archbishops and an influential political figure of the period. He brought the archbishopric to its peak of power. Life It is assumed that Peter of Aspelt was born between 1240 and 1245, either in Aspelt, a small village in the County of Luxembourg, about 50 km west of Trier, or in Trier.There have been discussions in the past about his birthplace, since an inscription on the slab of his tomb in Mainz Cathedral mentions Trier as birthplace (\\"De Treveris natus\\"). The initial words of the inscription are: Anno milleno tricentoque viceno Petrum petra tegit tegat hunc qui tartara fregit. De Treveris natus, presul fuit hic trabeatus. Redditibus, donis, et clenodis sibi pronis. Ecclesiam ditat, res auget, crimina vitat. Peter von Aspelt, Das Grabmal Peters von Aspelt. His father Gerhard worked as a servant at St. Maximin's Abbey in Trier. Peter attended school in Trier, continuing his studies of theology and philosophy, as well as law and medicine, at the universities in Padua, Bologna and Paris. In 1280, he became a pastor in Riol and Birtlingen. In 1286, he obtained the prebend of St. Martin in Bingen am Rhein which was annexed to a canonry of Mainz Cathedral. In the same year, he was appointed chaplain and personal physician to Rudolf of Habsburg, German King of the Romans since 1273. Statuta provincialia, 14th-century manuscript Peter of Aspelt later became an opponent of the Habsburgs on the wider European stage.Peter Herde, p. 530 in The New Cambridge Medieval History (2005), editor Rosamond McKitterick. At that time, the Archbishopric of Mainz had strong ties with the realm of Bohemia. Not only did Bohemia form a part of the ecclesiastical province of Mainz, in addition, Count Siegfried II of Eppstein (1200‚Äì30) had received in 1228 the right to crown the King of Bohemia-a right retained by Mainz until 1343.Mainz, Catholic Encyclopedia (1913) Thus, after being rejected to join the cathedral chapter at the Archbishopric of Trier, Peter entered the service of Wenceslaus II, King of Bohemia, in 1289, serving him as prothonotary, and as chancellor from 1296 onwards. In March 1297, Peter was appointed Bishop of Basel by Pope Boniface VIII.Aspelt, Peter von, hls-dhs-dss.ch He remained in that position until 1306, when he was made Archbishop of Mainz by Pope Clement V succeeding of Eppstein (1286‚Äì1305) who had died in the previous year. The Archbishop of Mainz not only was an influential ecclesiastic person, as Prince-elector of Mainz and Archchancellor of the Empire, he also was one of the mightiest secular persons in the Holy Roman Empire. Under Peter of Aspelt Mainz attained the pinnacle of its power.Mainz, catholic.com Prince-elector of Mainz Peter of Aspelt (left) in Frankfurt in November 1308. Peter not only supported Baldwin, a brother of Henry VII, Count of Luxemburg, in his election as Archbishop- Elector of Trier, but also instigated the election of Henry VII as German King of the Romans. Henry was elected with six votes at Frankfurt on 27 November 1308.Henry of Luxemburg , europeanhistory.boisestate.edu He was crowned Holy Roman Emperor under the title of Henry VIILuxemburg, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 1911 in 1312, but died already in August of the following year in Italy.

Peter administered the County of Luxemburg and the Bohemian realm during the minority of Henry's son, John of Bohemia, also known as John the Blind.Master Theodoric, About Emperor Charles IV whom he helped become King of Bohemia, crowning him on February 7, 1311.Peter von Aspelt, regionalgeschichte.net However, after the death of Holy Roman Emperor Henry VII in 1313, the Luxemburg party among the prince electors set aside Henry's son, King John of Bohemia, because of his youth and chose Louis the Bavarian from the House of Wittelsbach as rival king to Frederick the Fair. Louis was elected in October 1314 upon the instigation of Peter of Aspelt with five of the seven votes. Then Louis was hastily crowned German King of the Romans by Peter in Aachen,Peter von Aspelt 1240-1320, rlb.de while Frederick was crowned in Bonn by the Prince-Elector of Cologne. A bloody conflict broke out between the two kings and lasted for years, while Pope John XXII tried to stay neutral in the first years. Finally, Frederick was decisively defeated in the Battle of M√ºhldorf in 1322. Louis IV became Holy Roman Emperor in 1328. Peter von Aspelt, however, did not live long enough to witness this. He had already died in 1320. Matthias von Buchegg succeeded him as Archbishop of Mainz in 1321.

Designed by Max Abramovitz and completed in 1963, it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is the world's first two-sided building.The Phoenix Building, Hartford It is home to The Phoenix Companies. Description and history The Phoenix Building is located east of the commercial core of downtown Hartford, on a block bounded by Columbus Boulevard and State, Prospect, and Grove Streets. It is set on an elevated plaza, which is connected by a footbridge to Constitution Plaza, an contemporaneous development to the north, and to later developments to the east and south. The location is highly visible from local highways. The area under the plaza includes a parking garage and other service areas, and is partially taken up by a sunken plaza with fountain. Office spaces with floor- to-ceiling windows line the sunken portion of the plaza. The main tower is located off-center on the northwest part of the plaza, and is oriented roughly east‚Äìwest. The 13-story tower has only two curved sides, in an unusual and striking shape variously termed an elliptic lenticular cylinder or lenticular hyperboloid. Its height is 212 feet (65 meters); it measures 225 feet on its long axis, and 87 feet wide at its maximum width. It is supported by steel columns, and its floors consist of steel panels with integrated service conduits, with concrete poured on top. The windows are fashioned with interlocking frames, eliminating the need for visible mullions. Mullions are placed at every third bay anyway, grooved to allow for use by window-cleaning equipment. The lobby area at the plaza level is rectangle recessed entirely beneath the bulk of the tower, with the overhanging sections of the tower supported by splayed steel beams. The building was designed by the nationally renowned architect Max Abramovitz of Harrison & Abramovitz, whose previous work included coordinating the work on the United Nations headquarters and Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center. The contractor was George A. Fuller Company. Groundbreaking was in 1961, with construction complete in November 1963. The building has been an architectural landmark in the city since its construction, occupying a highly-visible location near the Connecticut River and major highways.

Increasing numbers of pilgrims to this shrine made necessary a new street leading from Sloten to the shrine, and this new street became known as the Holy Way.

That original chapel had been built in 1347 as a result of the miracle of Amsterdam (15 March 1345), located on the Kalverstraat where this miracle with the eucharistic host occurred. History Storefronts on the Rokin today that were built as part of the complex in 1908, behind them the church tower can be seen In the beeldenstorm of 1566 the chapel was severely damaged, and after the Alteratie, the chapel came into Protestant hands, when it was renamed the Nieuwezijds Chapel by them. The yearly procession that until then had taken place by the Catholics, was forbidden. In 1881, this tradition was reinstated as the Stille Omgang. The building was deconstructed in 1908, after the Protestant church fathers decided to consolidate the space and sell off the surrounding land to generate income. At that period the Catholic Church was enjoying a surge in popularity and the Protestants were determined not to \\"give them back their church grounds\\". The various sections of the old church outside the part left for the modern chapel, were stripped of useful materials, to prevent them ever being used again for Catholic worship, and the ground was sold for the construction of shops, so that the Catholics could never have it back. The miracle church's function had already long been taken over by the Roman Catholic schuilkerk at the Amsterdam Beguinage. Despite these measures, the site still has many parts of the old church intact, and the cultural history of the entire site is important for the city of Amsterdam. Parts of the chapel are still to be found in the Enge Kapelsteeg and on the roof of the schuilkerk De Papegaai in the Kalverstraat.Rijksmonument report A few fragments of the chapel came to be on the Frankendael in the Watergraafsmeer. On the Rokin was erected the Mirakelkolom (miracle column), though this was disassembled and raised for the construction of the North-south line of the Amsterdam Metro.

He had two older brothers, Edgar Isaac and Gerald. As two of his paternal aunts married into wealthy American families, Babette Newgass Lehman (married to Meyer Lehman) and Esther Newgass Hellman (married to Isaias W. Hellman), his father was named the head of the Lehman family cotton operations in New Orleans (named Lehman, Newgass & Co) after the Lehman brothers moved their headquarters to New York City. His father later moved to Liverpool, then the global center of textile manufacturing, and opened a branch office. The three brothers-in-laws continued to invest in each others ventures in railroads, banks, and commodities. Harold had served in the Territorial Army attached to the Royal Artillery from 1918 to 1934. Second World War On the evening of 28-29 November 1940, a German parachute mine fell on the Garston Gas Works in Liverpool. It was unknown whether it was magnetic, acoustic, delayed action or just a \\"dud\\". Consequently, this caused extensive disruption in the area, with factory work halted and over 6,000 people removed from the vicinity. Additionally, railway and dock sidings were closed and the gas supply to the south and east of Liverpool was disrupted.Campaign to honour WWII Garston gas works bomb hero Harold Newgass A defused, German 1000kg 'Luftmine' similar to the one defused by Newgass. Glasgow, 18 March 1941 The \\"luftmine\\" had fallen through a large gas holder and its parachute had become entangled in the hole in the roof. The large entry hole made by the mine allowed gas to escape and a portion of the roof to sink. The mine was resting on the floor nearly upright, nose down in some of oily water. It was also leaning on one of the -high brick piers on which, in turn, the iron pillars that supported the roof were fixed. Additionally, the mine's fuse mechanism was against the pillar, meaning that the mine had to be turned before it could be defused. Some of the water was pumped out and an access hole was cut into the side of the gas holder. The job of now rendering the mine safe was left to Temporary Lieutenant Harold Newgass.The Story of Harold Newgass Newgass could only enter the gas holder with the aid of breathing apparatus supplying oxygen via cylinder. The Auxiliary Fire Service prepared six cylinders, each with a life of about 30 minutes. He would have to take it in stages over the next two days. Newgass now worked hard to use each available cylinder's 30-minute window. The strain of the operation meant that Newgass used more and more oxygen and the 30 minutes dwindled rapidly. He later commented: \\"Working in an oxygen mask is a bit of a strain\\". Using the first cylinder, Newgass checked the mine and prepared his plan to defuse the device. Using the second cylinder, he carried his tools and a ladder to the mine. On the third sortie he placed sandbags around the nose of the mine, and tied the top of the mine to the iron roof support. On 30 November 1940, using the fourth cylinder, Newgass began the difficult defusing operation. Turning the mine to reveal the fuse he then removed it and the unit primer and detonator. Almost exhausted Newgass returned for the fifth cylinder and now turned the mine further to undo clock- keep ring. With his final cylinder he was again to extract the clock, rendering the mine inert. Garston employers now removed the mine by removing it with block and tackle. It was put on a lorry for disposal. Had the mine detonated, the whole of Garston Works, and much of the surrounding properties would have been completely destroyed in the blast.The Story of Harold Newgass Newgass was subsequently awarded the George Cross for his actions. The announcement for the award was published in the London Gazette on 4 March 1941, reading: Legacy Newgass's medal group of George Cross, Defence Medal and War Medal 1939-45 are on display in the Victoria Cross & George Cross Gallery at the Imperial War Museum in London.Newgass, Harold Reginald There is a street named after him on a new housing estate in Garston where all the other streets are named after English ports.

They also mined the approaches to the ports with non-contact mines, triggered by a ship's magnetic field, which were difficult to detect and \\"sweep\\" using conventional methods. =16/17 September 1940= On the night of 16/17 September 1940, the Luftwaffe dropped 25 parachute mines on to London, causing widespread damage. Seventeen failed to explode and Sub-Lieutenant Moore and Lieutenant Commander Dick Ryan of the Royal Navy's Torpedo and Mining School at Portsmouth volunteered to deal with them. Though the first mine had been initially ticking it was silent when the two men arrived to examine it. They were aware the bombs had self-destruction mechanism with a 22-second delay clock, but they could not tell if the clock had stopped or be sure of preventing it from restarting. If they heard the bomb start to tick they would have to run for cover. The operation to neutralise the first three mines was successfully completed and Ryan formed two teams, each manned by an officer and a petty officer, to deal with the remainder. =Dagenham 1940= On the night of 20/21 September 1940, four parachute mines fell on Dagenham but only one exploded. Moore, working alongside Chief Petty Officer George Wheeler, examined one of the unexploded bombs with a very damaged fuse ring which could not be removed. Moore used a borrowed drill to drill either side of the fuse so it broke in half and could be extracted. He was removing the mine's magnetic trigger when Ryan arrived after disarming another mine. Having satisfied himself that the mine which Moore was handling had been made safe, Ryan went to a warehouse some 200 yards away, to deal with the last mine. As he and his assistant entered the building the mine, which was hanging by its parachute, exploded, killing both men.Guardian Obituary ‚Äì Richard Moore, GC Moore was one of the first to be invested with the George Cross by King George VI at Buckingham Palace on 17 June 1941; Ryan and his assistant received posthumous George Crosses. His citation, published in the London Gazette of 27 December 1940, noted his courage in tackling a damaged mine that had fallen on Dagenham, Essex, on 20 September 1940. =Later war career= Moore served with the mines counter-measures section at the Admiralty until appointed torpedo officer of the light cruiser in the Mediterranean in 1942. He saw action in support of the Eighth Army in the coastal waters of North Africa and during Operation Vigorous, when Rear Admiral Sir Philip Vian tried to fight a relief convoy through to Malta. After being involved in the Navy's support for the Allied landings in Sicily, Salerno and Anzio, Moore served as deputy director of Torpedoes and Mining on the Admiralty delegation in Washington, D.C. for the last year of the war. Post-war career On leaving the Navy in 1946, Moore worked for the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, where he was appointed maintenance manager of the research reactor Bepo. Soon he was drawing on his pre-war experience to conduct a study on whether a larger reactor could produce heat at cheaper prices. With his service experience Moore was frequently chosen to be the public spokesman on atomic issues. When Georgi Malenkov, the Russian energy minister, was shown round the Calder Hall plant in 1956, it was Moore, by then chief design engineer, who assured the press that care had been taken not to tell him either the station's output or commercial value. After the construction of Calder Hall was completed, Moore became director of reactor design at the UK Atomic Energy Authority and managing director of the establishment's reactor group. As such, he was the driving force behind the advanced gas-cooled reactors, which have led to today's more efficient nuclear power. In 1966, he toured the country giving his Faraday lecture \\"Nuclear Power Today and Tomorrow\\".

The projecting beam the anchor hangs from when not secured is a cathead (left). The anchor has a stock (cross- piece, in this case wooden) below, and curved flukes above (end-on); the shank is the near-vertical metal bar running between them, lashed with the stock painter James Craig; the cat tail protrudes onto the deck and is fastened to the cat-beam. A cathead is a large wooden beam located on either side of the bow of a sailing ship, and angled forward at roughly 45 degrees. The beam is used to support the ship's anchor when raising it (weighing anchor) or lowering it (letting go), and for carrying the anchor on its stock-end when suspended outside the ship's side. The cathead is furnished with sheaves at the outer end, and the inner end (which is called the cat's-tail) fits down on the cat-beam. The shank painter is a short rope or chain by which the shank of an anchor is held fast to a ship's side when not in use. The process of securing the anchor is called catting and fishing it. The cat stopper also fastens the anchor on. The purpose of the cathead is to provide both a heavy enough beam to support the massive weight of the anchor, and to hold the metal anchor away from the wooden side of the ship to prevent damage when the anchor is being raised from the water. The stockless anchor made the cathead obsolete. In common practice, the projecting end of the beam was carved to resemble the face of a lion or cat. Whether such carving was due to a play on the already existing name of the beam or whether the beam was so named because of the practice of such carving is unknown. The origin of the term \\"cathead\\" is obscure, but dates at least to the 17th century, as it was used by Mainwaring and Boteler in their dictionaries. The Mainwaring dictionary was written in 1623. Nautical author Robert Charles Leslie, writes: \\"The term catheads used for the two stout projecting timbers on either bow, from which the anchor hung clear of the ship before letting go, was no doubt connected with the fact of a lion or large cat usually carved upon the end of the item.\\" Old Sea Wings, Ways and Words in the Days of Oak and Hemp (1890), page 154 Vasa with cathead visible upper middle right.  Additional nautical use of the term  A second \\"cat head\\" was associated with a ship's anchor-cable and windlass. This was a square pin thrust into one of the handspike holes of a ship's windlass. When at anchor, the anchor rope (called a cable or catfall) was secured to this with a smaller rope tie called a seizing. The English term for this pin was 'Norman'. In German, however, it was called a Kattenkopf (cat-head), and in this case it is a reference to the traditional way the top was notched and chamfered off so that in cross section, it resembled the ears of a cat.

A clandestine church (), defined by historian Benjamin J. Kaplan as a \\"semi-clandestine church\\", is a house of worship used by religious minorities whose communal worship is tolerated by those of the majority faith on condition that it is discreet and not conducted in public spaces. Schuilkerken are commonly built inside houses or other buildings, and do not show a public fa√ßade to the street. They were an important advance in religious tolerance in the wake of the Reformation, an era when worship services conducted by minority faiths were often banned and sometimes penalized by exile or execution. History According to historian Benjamin Kaplan, clandestine churches became common in Europe in the wake of the Reformation as a way for governments to permit a degree of religious toleration for minority Christian denominations and Jews. Both political and religious considerations frequently led governments to ban all worship not sanctioned by the state, and in many countries, members of minority religions worshiped together in total secrecy, risking punishment by the state. However, such a regime was frequently difficult to enforce, and as a result, while many jurisdictions permitted only one form of worship, authorities knowingly permitted members of minority faiths to worship privately. In others, the law permitted public worship by minority faiths, but only if it was more or less invisible to the general public.Kaplan, Benjamin J., Religious Conflict and the Practice of Toleration in Early Modern Europe, Harvard University Press, 2007, Chapter 8, pp. 198. ff.. The 1648 Treaty of Osnabruck, part of the Peace of Westphalia, specified three types of worship: \\"domestic devotion\\", public religious services (\\"exercitium religionis publicum\\"), and private religious services (\\"exercitium religionis privatum\\"). It is into this last category that clandestine churches fall. These churches were characterized by group religious services carried out by clergy \\"in their own houses or in other houses designated for the purpose,\\" and not \\"in churches at set hours.\\" Kaplan writes that the pretense of clandestinity \\"enabled Europeans to accommodate dissent without confronting it directly, to tolerate knowingly what they could not bring themselves to accept fully.\\" In a surviving Dutch document from 1691, the Regents of the City of Amsterdam specified the terms under which a Roman Catholic church, called the Glabais, could be built by the Franciscans \\"to avoid giving any offense.\\" The entrance must not be on the Jodenbreestraat, but \\"behind\\" on a lesser thoroughfare, the Burgwal. There would be no parking of sleds on the Jodenbreestraat. There was to be no \\"waiting for another person\\" on the street after services. The priest was responsible for seeing that no beggars came to ask the worshipers for alms. Services were timed so that there would be no chance of Roman Catholics offending Protestants by meeting them in the streets on their way to Dutch Reformed churches. And, finally, the Catholics must not walk to church in groups, nor carry prayer books, rosaries, or \\"other offensive objects\\" in a manner that made them visible to Protestant eyes. Benjamin J. Kaplan regards these requirements as typical of those in effect across Europe wherever clandestine churches were permitted. In 1701, the intendant of Alsace, F√©lix Le Pelletier de La Houssaye ruled against a complaint brought by an abbe, writing that \\"The worship which the Jews established in Reichshoffen is not as public as one would have you believe. There is no synagogue per se, only, by a custom long established in this province, when there are seven Jewish families in one locale, those who compose them assemble, without scandal, in a house of their sect for readings and prayers.\\" A line was crossed when an actual building was erected as a prayer house, as the Jews of Biesheim, Wintzenheim and Hagenthal discovered when each community had a newly built synagogue razed by the Conseil Souverain of Alsace in the 1720s. Although early clandestine churches were makeshift spaces, by the 17th century some, usually Catholic, churches had constructed elaborately decorated baroque interiors.\\"The Artist's Religion: Paintings Commissioned for Clandestine Catholic Churches in the Northern Netherlands, 1600-1800,\\" Xander van Eck, Simiolus: Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art, Vol. 27, No. 1/2 (1999), pp. 70-94. Artists who painted works commissioned by clandestine churches include Gerard van Honthorst, Abraham Bloemaert, Jan Miense Molenaer, Pieter de Grebber, Claes Corneliszoon Moeyaert and Jan de Bray. In 1781, under the Patent of Toleration, the Austrian Empire for the first time instituted limited legal toleration of minority faiths, permitting them to conduct \\"private religious exercises\\" in clandestine churches. Emperor Joseph II's Patent specified that these clandestine churches might not ring a bell or build bell towers or any public entrance on the street. Vienna's Stadttempel, a synagogue built in 1825 with an extremely handsome interior, is an excellent surviving example. It is completely concealed in the interior of a block of residential buildings.Rachel Wischnitzer, Architecture of the European Synagogue, Jewish Publication Society of America, 1964, p. 178.

Such churches were built in large numbers during the time of the Dutch Republic for use by Roman Catholics, Remonstrants, Lutherans and Mennonites. In cities schuilkerken were especially established in houses and warehouses, whereas in the countryside such churches generally had the appearance of a shed and so became known as Schuurkerken (barn churches). All clandestine churches of necessity lacked exterior markers that would identify them as churches; they had no bells, towers, steeples, crosses, icons or exterior architectural splendor. =Rural= St. Ninian's Church, Tynet, Scotland, is a typical, rural clandestine Catholic church. Built in 1755, it resembles a long, low barn. It is a dramatic contrast with its replacement, St. Gregory's Church, Preshome, Scotland, the first openly Catholic church to be built in Scotland after the Reformation, whose proud Italian Baroque facade with the date in Latin, \\"DEO 1788\\", announces its Catholicism to the world. =Freestanding urban= Amsterdam's Vrijburg (1629) is a typical freestanding, urban clandestine church. It is built at the center of the block, completely surrounded by houses on all four sides, so that it neither fronts on, nor is visible from, any public street. =House churches= The church Ons' Lieve Heer op Solder in Amsterdam, currently a museum, is a notable example of a house Catholic church. A Jewish house synagogue survives in Traenheim in Alsace. It is an upstairs room in a half-timbered house renovated for use as a place of public worship in 1723 over the \\"vociferous\\" objections of the town's pastor but with the permission of the government. The room still has Hebrew prayers on the walls.

The Alteratie (Eng: Alteration) is the name given to the change of power in Amsterdam on May 26, 1578, when the Catholic city government was deposed in favor of a Protestant one. The coup should be seen in the context of the greater Dutch Revolt that was breaking out in this time. Trade interests played an important role, because Amsterdam was becoming isolated as surrounding cities and towns joined the revolt, and other cities were threatening to take over its trade. No one was injured or killed during the coup. On May 29, a new city council was formed, consisting of 30 Calvinists and 10 Catholics. Already after a few months, plans were presented to expand the city and the harbor on the eastern side (Lastage), and to construct new defensive fortifications (Oude Schans). Conditions before the Alteratie After the Pacification of Ghent in 1576, Amsterdam was forced to subject itself to the Prince of Orange and the States of Holland, but the city-government wanted to stay loyal to King Philip II of Spain, and they were opposed to letting the reformed church become the official religion. Only when the new Regent, John of Austria, recognised the Pacification, did Amsterdam follow his example. Lengthy negotiations followed about the Satisfactie (Eng: Satisfaction), a treaty that would put the city under the authority of the Prince of Orange and the States of Holland. After an incursion into the city by the Geuzen on November 23, 1577, the city government finally signed the treaty on February 8, 1578.Hell, M. (1997) 'Kennen, respecteren ende gehoorsamen'. Amsterdamse schouten en hun ambt. In: Jaarboek Amstelodamum 89, p. 16. In 1578, Amsterdam was one of the most important cities that had not yet joined the Prince of Orange in his rebellion against King Philip II. The war was costly, and a number of cities threatened to defect to the side of the King. With the Satisfactie, Amsterdam joined the rest of the cities of Holland in joining the rebellion. Nonetheless, tensions increased when a conflict arose with the burgomasters of Amsterdam about the control over the schutterij. An important issue with all cities was the question of religious freedom: if at least one hundred Protestant families resided in a city, they had the right to gather for their own religious services. After a Hedge Preaching, the issue rapidly escalated. Rebellion The old city hall on the Dam square in an engraving from the 17th century A commission of old Geuzen and a large group of former exiled residents, many of whom owned land and warehouses on the Lastage, organised a gathering to plan their next move. The next day the Dam Square was closed off from the public. The catholic vroedschap (the city-council) was escorted to the Damrak, where barges had been prepared to take them out of Amsterdam. On May 26, 1578, 24 city-council members were forced to leave Amsterdam. They settled in Haarlem or Leiden or quietly returned later on. The Franciscans, who were hated by the population, were also forced to leave. The remaining monks were allowed to remain in the city, and received a pension. The monks were rich and possessed much land; in some monasteries there were hardly any monks present. Consequences As a result of the Alteratie, the parish-churches and chapels came into the hands of the Protestants, who renamed them. The oldest parish church of the city, the St. Nicolaschurch, was rechristened as the Oude Kerk, and the Heilige Stede became the Nieuwe Zijds Kapel. The New Church was taken over by the Calvinists after a minor iconoclastic movement in September. The large number of monasteries of the city came under the control of the new city-government, and were given new, non-religious purposes, such as orphanages or prisons. Valuable books were collected in the New Church. Another consequence of the Alteratie was the reinforcement of the city walls. References Sources * Hooft, P.C.

It usually involves the use of synthetic sex pheromones, although other approaches, such as interfering with vibrational communication, are also being developed. History La confusion sexuelle or mating disruption, was first discussed by the Institut national de la recherche agronomique in 1974 in Bordeaux, France... Winemakers in France, Switzerland, Spain, Germany, and Italy were the first to use the method to treat vines against the larvae of the moth genus Cochylis..  Mechanism In many insect species of interest to agriculture, such as those in the order Lepidoptera, females emit an airborne trail of a specific chemical blend constituting that species' sex pheromone. This aerial trail is referred to as a pheromone plume.Stephen C. Welter, Carolyn Pickel, Jocelyn Millar, Frances Cave, Robert A. Van Steenwyk, John Dunley; Pheromone mating disruption offers selective management options for key pests.CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE, VOLUME 59, NUMBER 1 N. Carter,H. Fraser; Mating Disruption for Management of Insect Pests. OMAFRA.2003 Males of that species use the information contained in the pheromone plumeMafra-Neto, Agenor and Carde, Ring T. 1994. Fine-scale structure of pheromone plumes modulates upwind orientation of flying moths. Nature (London) 369 (6476): 142-144. to locate the emitting female (known as a ‚Äúcalling‚Äù female). Mating disruption exploits the male insects' natural response to follow the plume by introducing a synthetic pheromone into the insects‚Äô habitat. The synthetic pheromone is a volatile organic chemical designed to mimic the species-specific sex pheromone produced by the female insect. The general effect of mating disruption is to confuse the male insects by masking the natural pheromone plumes, causing the males to follow ‚Äúfalse pheromone trails‚Äù at the expense of finding mates, and affecting the males‚Äô ability to respond to ‚Äúcalling\\" females. Consequently, the male population experiences a reduced probability of successfully locating and mating with females, which leads to the eventual cessation of breeding and collapse of the insect infestation. The California Department of Pesticide Regulation, the California Department of Food and Agriculture, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency consider mating disruption to be among the most environmentally friendly treatments used to eradicate pest infestations.California Department of Food & Agriculture 2007 Light Brown Apple Moth Questions and Answers Mating disruption works best if large areas are treated with pheromones. Ten acres is a good minimum size for a successful MD program, but larger areas are preferable[2]  Advantages of mating disruption  Pheromone programs are most effective when controlling low to moderate pest population densities. MD has also been identified as a pest control method in which the insect does not become resistant[1]. The scientific community, together with governmental agencies throughout the world, understands the benefits of mating disruption using species-specific sex pheromones, and consider sex-pheromone-based insect control programs among the most environmentally friendly treatments to be used to manage and control insect pest populations. Insect pheromone has been successfully used as an effective tool to slow the spread and to eradicate pests from very large areas in the US; for example to control the Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), a devastating forestry pest, and to eradicate the boll weevil and pink bollworm, two of the most damaging pest of cotton. Conventional pesticide based control methods, kill insects directly, whereas mating disruption confuses male insects from accurately locating a mating partner, leading to the eventual collapse of the mating cycle[3]. Mating disruption, due to the specificity of the sex pheromone of the insect species, has the benefit of only affecting the males of that species, while leaving other non target species unaffected[3]. This allows for very targeted pest management, promoting the suppression of a single pest species, leaving the populations of beneficial insects (pollinators and natural enemies) intact. Mating disruption, like most pest management strategies, is a useful technique, but should not be considered a stand-alone treatment program[1] for it targets only a single species in plant production systems that usually have several pests of concern. Mating disruption is a valuable tool that should be used in Integrated Pest Management(IPM) programs. Pheromone programs have been used for several decades around the globe and to date (2009) there is no documented public health evidence to suggest that agricultural use of synthetic pheromones is harmful to humans or to any other non-target species. However, continuing research is being conducted.  Disadvantages of mating disruption  Over the decades that pheromone pest programs have been used several disadvantages have been argued when compared to the use of conventional pesticides. Most pheromones target a single species, so a specific mating disruption formulation controls only the species that uses that pheromone blend; whereas pesticides usually kill indiscriminately a plethora of species, including multiple species with a single application. Some synthetic pheromones have high developmental and production costs, causing the mating disruption technique to be too costly to be adopted by conventional commercial growers. Furthermore most commercial pheromone mating disruption formulations must be applied by hand, which can be an expensive and time consuming. Novel pheromone formulations recently developed to be mechanically applied provide long lasting mating disruption effects (e.g., depending on the target pest a single application of SPLAT controls the target pest for a complete reproductive cycle,Lapointe, Stephen L.; Stelinski, Lukasz L.; Evens, Terence J.; Niedz, Randall P.; Hall, David G.; Mafra-Neto, Agenor. 2009.

Season-long mating disruption of Grapholita molesta (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae).  Methods of dispersal  = Microencapsulated pheromones = Microencapsulated pheromones (MECs) are small droplets of pheromone enclosed within polymer capsules. The capsules control the release rate of the pheromone into the surrounding environment. The capsules are small enough to be applied in the same method as used to spray insecticides. The effective field longevity of the microencapsulated pheromone formulations ranges from a few days to slightly more than a week, depending on climatic conditions, capsule size and chemical properties[1]. Microcapsules in the pheromone formulations are usually kept above a prescribed diameter to avoid the risk of inhalation by humans. = Hand applied dispensers = *Hollow tube dispensers are plastic twist-tie type dispensers, plastic hollow fibers or plastic hollow microfibers fibers, filled with synthetic sex pheromone and placed throughout the area to be protected. *Pheromone Baits and Stations are a stationary, attract and kill type of dispensers. Some are relatively large platform, containing a pheromone lure inside a glue board that ensnares the attracted insect. Other pheromone bait stations contain a pheromone lure in conjunction with a surface containing a dose of insecticide that reduces the attracted insect's fitness, thus reducing its ability to mate and reproduce. *High- emission dispensers There are several very high dose pheromone dispensers, some do it passively, like pheromone sachets and large dollops of SPLAT pheromone formulations, others do it be actively releasing bursts of sex pheromone at timed intervals.Mafra-Neto, A. and T.C.

Although mechanical dispersal techniques require specialized off-the-shelf application technology and/or equipment, once the application system is made to work it allows protection of extensive areas using pheromones, one of the most benign and effective pest management techniques available today. A benefit of SPLAT is that the dollop anchors where it lands, avoiding unwanted drift of the formulation once applied in the field, and, depending on the mode of application, the cured dollops are retrievable. = Aerial dispersal = In November 2007, a controversial aerial approach was used to spray microencapsulated LBAM pheromone in urban and rural areas of the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey California to combat the invasive light brown apple moth. Usually the effect of disruption of orientation of the male moths to females (or monitoring pheromone traps) can be detected by the reduction in moth capture in monitoring pheromone traps. The government campaign using areawide aerial microencapsulated pheromone applications failed to show any sign of mating disruption on the light brown apple moth populations in the treated area. It was found that the first aerial campaign was performed using an incomplete (the wrong) pheromone blend of the light brown apple moth (the wrong blend decreased tremendously the likelihood of success of the mating disruption program), and the LBAM microencapsulated formulation was untested, and finally, microencapsule formulations are notoriously known for their short field life, weak and erratic performance. Furthermore it is possible that the LBAM microencapsulated formulation used in the government campaign was unfit for aerial delivery in urban areas; although pheromone is safe, the formulation used had microcapsules of very small diameter which made it into a possible inhalation hazard that seems to be linked to an increase in allergenic reactions of the population in the target area. This set of LBAM mating disruption aerial applications done by the government has created tremendous dissent of the public in general as well as of several sectors of the scientific community. Now, several years later, the affected communities as well as the nascent US pheromone industry (which provides safer, yet very effective, alternatives to the use of conventional pesticides) are still suffering the ripple effects of these disastrous Bay Area LBAM eradication campaigns. But there are numerous, successful pest suppression programs that rely on aerial dispersal of pheromone mating disruptants. One of the largest pheromone mating disruption programs in the globe is the Gypsy Moth Slow the Spread. Gypsy Moth Slow the Spread has been implemented across the gypsy moth frontier from Wisconsin to North Carolina. The program area is located ahead of the advancing front of the gypsy moth population. The STS program focuses on early detection and suppression of the low‚Äìlevel populations along this advancing front, disrupting the natural progress of population buildup and spread. Every year hundreds of thousands of acres are aerially sprayed with two pheromone Gypsy moth pheromone mating disruption formulations, Flakes and SPLAT. A single mating disruption formulation application promotes season-long suppression of gypsy moth in the treated areas. With a crew of 8 people it was possible to aerially treat with SPLAT GM over of forest in a single day. The consortium of Federal and State participants have been able to do the following: ‚Ä¢ decrease the new territory invaded by the gypsy moth each year from to ; ‚Ä¢ protect forests, forest‚Äìbased industries, urban and rural parks, and private property; and ‚Ä¢ avoid at least $22 million per year in damage and management costs. It seems that the tremendous success of the Gypsy Moth Slow the Spread program is related to extremely well planned campaigns, which involves communication, transparency and clarity of objectives: in advance to an application STS holds meetings that include the area population in general, concerned citizens, public officials, scientists and technical personnel to discuss strategies of management of Gypsy moth in the areas of concern. There is a movement requesting that new government invasive species eradication campaigns model their pest suppression actions on the existing successful suppression programs like GM STS, and embrace a more effective policy of communication, transparency and clarity of objectives. With the involvement and education of the public, areawide eradication campaigns will be better planned and more able to deliver decisive end effective pest eradication actions.

CMAG membership rotated once again, with Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Saint Lucia, and the United Kingdom joining it, as the Bahamas, India, Samoa, and Nigeria left.

The film, presenting libertine and pagan Lully as a natural ally of the early Enlightenment figure Louis XIV of France in his conflicts with the Catholic establishment, focuses on Lully's personal relationship with the King, as well as his camaraderie with Moli√®re and rivalry with Robert Cambert. Plot Lully (Boris Terral) starts to gain the favour of the 14-year-old King Louis in 1653 by giving him specially designed shoes for Ballet Royal de la Nuit. His subsequent rise draws hostility from the old cadres of the court, particularly the royal composer Cambert (Johan Leysen). However, following Cardinal Mazarin's death, Louis (Beno√Æt Magimel) installs himself in full power as the king in 1661 and he is now at stake with the religious establishment created and controlled by his mother Anne of Austria (Colette Emmanuelle) at the Palais-Royal. On the other hand, Lully's animosity with Cambert comes to a novel dimension after Cambert's mistress Madeleine Lambert (C√©cile Bois), the daughter of Michel Lambert, marries Lully in 1662. Lully and another Versailles favourite Moli√®re (Tch√©ky Karyo) are keen to further disarm the old court but they get to understand their limits when conflict becomes more manifest at events such as staging (and consequent ban) of Tartuffe in 1664. Meanwhile, the passing years bring an end to Lully's position as the king's dance teacher and choreographer and he also has to face the emotional tensions growing with his wife's niece Julie (Claire Keim), which will culminate at the gala of Cambert's Pomone in 1671.

Roundwood colliery is No. 9 in the east. Roundwood Colliery was a coal mine situated in the Don Valley, about 2 miles north of Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England on the borders of Rotherham and Rawmarsh.  History  Coal gathering in the Aldwarke area, lands of the old manor which stretch across the Don Valley from Parkgate to Thrybergh, goes back to the 17th century with documents relating to tenants' rights of way over the grounds and the river Dunne (Don) at Aldwarke ford, on both sides of river; and to any person fetching coals from pits. Earlier records still refer to charkcole (charcoal) to be cut in Rounde woodde near Aldwarke Manor house. It is from Rounde woodde that this colliery takes its name.  Deep Mining  The Deep Mine, named Roundwood, was set a short distance north of Aldwarke Main Colliery between the main line of the Midland Railway, north of Parkgate and Rawmarsh and the Mexborough to Sheffield line of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, north of Parkgate and Aldwarke. It was established in the early 1860s and had connections to both railways and to staithes alongside the river Don. In 1880 the colliery was listed as being owned by Cooper, Sellars and Company, becoming The Roundwood Colliery Company by 1896. This company was purchased by John Brown and Company and became the foundation of the Dalton Main Colliery Company. Dalton Main Collieries were responsible for the sinking of Silverwood Colliery, these collieries being joined by a railway built by the owners and known as John Brown's Private Railway and over which a Paddy Mail service operated until the 1930s when it was discontinued in favour of \\"pit buses\\" which were operated by private companies and, later Rotherham Corporation. From 1908 the collieries were joined underground. This underground joining of the collieries meant that the drawing of coal could be concentrated at Silverwood and the Roundwood shafts used for materials and men. In 1947 the colliery passed to the National Coal Board and was closed in the early 1960s.

Life Thomas Tyldesley was born on 3 September 1612 at Woodplumpton, the eldest of the six children of Edward Tyldesley (1582‚Äì1621) of Morleys Hall, Astley, in the parish of Leigh and his wife Elizabeth Preston of Holker Hall. He entered Gray's Inn intending to follow a career of law. Later he became a professional soldier and served in the Thirty Years' War in Germany. He married Frances, elder daughter of Ralph Standish in 1634 and they had three sons and seven daughters. His family were recusants and his grandmother arranged a pension for priest, Benedictine martyr Ambrose Barlow so that he could secretly carry out priestly duties, offering masses in secret in the homes of Catholics in the Leigh parish. Barlow was arrested at Morleys Hall during such a service. His aunt, Elizabeth Tyldesley, was abbess of the Poor Clares at Gravelines in the Spanish Netherlands from 1610 to 1654. Thomas Tyldesley was extremely wealthy according to the lay subsidy rolls. His annual landed income, mostly from tithes purchased from the Urmstons of Westleigh, was ¬£2050 in 1641. Tyldesley served King Charles I as lieutenant colonel at the Battle of Edgehill, after raising Regiments of Horse, Foot and Dragoons, and at the desperate storming of Burton-on-Trent over a bridge of 36 arches, received the honour of Knighthood. Afterwards he served in all three of the Civil Wars as a commander of some importance. He was present with Prince Rupert of the Rhine at the Bolton Massacre in 1644. He was Governor of Lichfield and followed the fortune of the Crown through the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and never surrendered to the Parliamentarians.

Elected on November 21, 2007, and sworn in on December 4, 2007, he was replaced on December 7 when his opponent, Osby Davis, requested a recount that showed Davis had won the election. Early years Cloutier grew up in Rhode Island and received a BA in Political Science from Brown University, where he was an all-Ivy defensive tackle and the winner of the Eugene Swift award. He received a law degree from Suffolk Law School in 1991. Between these two educational pursuits, Cloutier served as a legislative aide for Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-RI). Legal career Cloutier is the former law partner of pioneering gay civil rights lawyer Paul Wotman. Wotman and Cloutier were among the first lawyers in the State of California to make new law under the Americans with Disabilities Act for same- and opposite-sex couples who had been discriminated against in seeking life insurance due to the HIV status of one partner. In one of the first refusal to treat cases to go to trial since the United States Supreme Court ruled that people with asymptomatic HIV are protected by disability law, he won a significant verdict against a University of California surgeon who refused to operate on an HIV positive patient with avascular necrosis. In the more recent San Francisco Superior Court case of Gohstand v. Leibert, he obtained a large and highly publicized settlement on behalf of a straight man who was beaten outside a gay bar by two students from UC Berkeley who believed the victim was gay. Political career Cloutier's political career began with an involvement in the city government of Vallejo, California. He was first elected to the position of city councilman in 1999, and continued to serve as councilman and vice-mayor over the next eight years. In 2007, Cloutier participated in the mayoral race in Vallejo against real estate attorney Osby Davis. Both candidates represented a first for the city of Vallejo: Cloutier would be the first openly gay mayor of Vallejo, whereas Davis would be its first African-American mayor. The initial count of the voting results indicated that Cloutier had won the seat. He was elected on November 21, 2007, and was sworn in on December 4, 2007. However, when Davis requested a recount shortly thereafter, the results showed that Davis was the winner, and so the position was transferred. Arrest On November 17, 2007, Cloutier was arrested for charges of public intoxication in Palm Springs. He spent five hours in jail and was released. At a press conference outside Vallejo City Hall, Cloutier said he \\"...Made a mistake that I deeply regret... I had too much to drink...[and] I make no excuses, and I accept full responsibility for my actions. I have embarrassed myself, concerned my colleagues and disappointed my supporters. I deeply regret my actions, and apologize to the people I've let down, especially those who have worked so hard on my campaign.\\" Cloutier also said it would never happen again. The matter was dismissed after Cloutier pleaded to lesser charges stemming from the arrest and paid a $100 fine. Aftermath After the Vallejo mayoral race, Cloutier moved on to work as an aide to the Mayor and Commissioner of the City of Miami Beach. In 2010, he published a book, Rough Point, on his experience as an athlete, civil rights lawyer and politician. He also started maintaining a blog, \\"Among The Hogs,\\" that is dedicated to the art of living well in a great democracy. In March 2012, he was inducted into the Westerly High School Athletic Hall of Fame. Groundwork Providence In May 2012, Cloutier was taken on as Executive Director of Groundwork Providence. Groundwork Providence is an environmental and community development trust in Providence, Rhode Island. In January 2013, Citizens Bank awarded Groundwork Providence its \\"Champions in Action\\" award, which is given annually to the best non-profit organization in the state of Rhode Island. In August 2013, Cloutier left Groundwork Providence to return to practicing law in San Francisco.

Like the related Reginbodo family, they had a close relationship with the Archbishopric of Mainz and also had estates on the Middle Main. The male line of Ludovingians was extinguished on the death of Henry Raspe in 1247, leading to the War of the Thuringian Succession.  History  Around 1040 Louis the Bearded received a fief north of the Thuringian Forest and had the (now ruined) castle of Schauenburg near Friedrichroda. However these origins are legendary and based solely on unverifiable Reinhardsbrunn sources. Around 1080, Louis' sons, Louis the Springer and Beringer of Sangerhausen, founded the Abbey of Kloster Sch√∂nrain in the land of their ancestors, Main Franconia. In a deed dated 1100 the brothers are named as the counts of Schauenburg. In the period that followed, the Ludovingians expanded their possessions in Thuringia, for example around Sangerhausen, the estate of Cecilia, wife of Louis the Bearded (who died around 1080), and around estates on the River Unstrut, that Adelheid, that the widow of Count Palatine Frederick III, had left to Louis the Springer in her will. The latter built the castle of Wartburg (first mentioned in 1080) above Eisenach as his new seat of residence and in 1085 founded Reinhardsbrunn, henceforth the house monastery of the family. In the stormy period of the Investiture Controversy, Louis the Springer was one of the leading opponents of Emperor Henry V. The distinct anti-imperial stance of the Ludovingians, their prominent political position and other factors led Wolfgang Hartmann vertretene to propose that, amongst the famous benefactors portrayed in Naumburg Cathedral, were the statues of the founder of the Wartburg, Louis and his wife Adelheid. Even before 1122 the family's territory expanded under Louis' sons, Louis and Henry, acquiring estates near Marburg and Kassel, especially through the marriage of Louis I (d 1140) to Hedwig of Gudensberg, the daughter and heiress of the Hessian gau count, Giso IV, on the basis of which, after the death of Giso V in 1137, the vast inheritance of the House of Giso (Gisonen) and the counts of Werner in North Hesse was added to their domain. The link thus established between Thuringia and large parts of Hesse was not severed until the War of the Thuringian Succession. Until 1247, the Hessian estate of the Ludovingians was largely ruled by the younger brothers of the landgraves, who bore the title of Count of Gudensberg and of Hesse and in resided in Gudensberg and Marburg; they included Henry Raspe I, Henry Raspe II, Henry Raspe III and Conrad Raspe. In 1131, Louis was elevated by Emperor Lothair (of Supplinburg) to the rank of landgrave and became Louis I. As a consequence, Thuringia, as an imperially immediate territory, left the Duchy of Saxony, and the Ludovingians took on a ducal-like status in Thuringia. Around the middle of the 12th century, the landgravial minting capital of Eisenach was established and, somewhat later, the Gotha Mint as the second mint owned by the Ludovingians.Wolfgang Streguweit: Geschichte der M√ºnzst√§tte Gotha vom 12. bis zum 19. Jahrhundert, Weimar, 1987, p. 24 Under Louis II and Louis III the territory of the landgraviate was further expanded, whilst Hermann I sought to strengthen the position of his family politically, for example, through the marriages of his children. Prior to that, Hermann had to resist attempts by Emperor Henry VI, to turn the Landgraviate of Thuringia into a fiefdom following the death of Hermann's brother, Louis III. Hermann's son, Louis IV, who married the subsequently beatified Elizabeth of Hungary, hoped that, through the guardianship of his nephews, Henry Margrave of Meissen and a minor, to gain the March of Meissen. In 1226 he was indeed promised the enfeoffment of the March, but died the same year before he was able to actually acquire it. In 1241, following the death of Louis IV's son, the only 19-year-old Hermann II, Louis' brother, Henry Raspe, inherited the Landgraviate, which he had already ruled as regent during the minority of his nephew. A second brother, Conrad Raspe, ruled the Hessian estates of the family, but entered the Teutonic Order in 1234, soon becoming its Hochmeister. Henry Raspe, who in 1246 was elected as the German antiking, died in 1247. On his death the male line of the Ludovingians died out. In 1243, Henry Raspe had already arranged for his nephew, Henry, the Margrave of Meissen, to be enfeoffed with the Landgraviate of Thuringia. In 1249, Henry was able to secure his claims in Thuringia after military operations that ended in the Treaty of Wei√üenfels. These were not initially recognised, however, by his cousin Sophia of Brabant, the daughter of Louis IV. In 1259, she attempted, with the aid of Albert I of Brunswick, ab 1259 to gain a military foothold in Thuringia. After a heavy defeat at Besenstedt near Wettin in October 1263 she finally had to give up all claims to Thuringia in 1264, was successful in securing the claims of her son, Henry to the family's Hessian estate, which as the Landgraviate of Hesse became independent and, in 1291, an imperial principality.

After the war, he became one of the founders of HIAG, a lobby group and a revisionist organization of former Waffen-SS members. SS career Born in 1909 into a family of a merchant in Hamburg, Kumm trained as a typesetter and worked at a newspaper. On 1 June 1934, Kumm joined the SS-Verf√ºgungstruppe (SS Dispositional Troops) and on 1 July received his first training with the SS-Standarte \\"Germania\\" in Hamburg. Kumm commanded the Der F√ºhrer Regiment of the SS Division Das Reich from July 1941 to April 1943. This regiment was nearly destroyed in the Soviet offensive of January 1942, when it was reduced to 35 men out of the 2,000 that had started the campaign in June 1941. Kumm was a commander of the SS Division Prinz Eugen from 30 January 1944 until 20 January 1945 and then was appointed the new division commander of the SS Division Leibstandarte (LSSAH) as of 15 February 1945, after the division's commander Wilhelm Mohnke was wounded. As the division commander, Kumm and the LSSAH took part in Operation Spring Awakening (6 March 1945 ‚Äì 16 March 1945), the last major German offensive launched during World War II. The Germans launched attacks in Hungary near the Lake Balaton area on the Eastern Front. Soviet intelligence identified large German tank formations in western Hungary and developed a successful counterattack strategy. After the failure of Operation Spring Awakening, Sepp Dietrich's 6th SS Panzer Army and the LSSAH retreated to the Vienna area. After Vienna fell to the Red Army in the Vienna Offensive, the bulk of the LSSAH division surrendered to U.S. forces in the Steyr area on 8 May 1945. Kumm was held at the Dachau internment camp administered by the US Army. Kumm avoided extradition to Yugoslavia to stand trial for war crimes by fleeing over the wall of the camp. Activities within HIAG Otto Kumm (front row, left), Heinrich Himmler and other SS officers during a tour of Mauthausen- Gusen concentration camp, June 1941 After the war, Otto Kumm was denazified and became a businessman. Kumm was a founder and the first head of the Waffen- SS veterans' organization HIAG, established in 1951 to lobby for the cause of the Waffen-SS historical rehabilitation and restoration of their rights to post-war pensions. As the organization's chairman and its first spokesperson, Kumm set the tone for the rhetoric that was reflected in its publications and public discourse. In 1952, Otto Kumm published an editorial in the in-house magazine Wiking-Ruf (\\"Viking Call\\") outlining the organization's grievances: > Even during the war, and especially after the war, infamous and lying > propagandists have been able to make use of all the unfortunate events > connected to the Third Reich and also with the SS to destroy and drag > through the mud all of what was and is sacred to us. [...] Let us be clear > about it: the [Allied] battle was directed not only against the > authoritarian regime of the Third Reich, but, above all, against the > resurgence of the strength of the German people. At least through the 1970s, Kumm remained \\"the ever unreformed Nazi enthusiast\\" according to researcher Danny S. Parker, who was given access to the previously closed HIAG archives. Perceived by the West German government to be a Nazi organization, HIAG was disbanded in 1992. Kumm died on 23 March 2004. Works *Vorw√§rts, Prinz Eugen! Geschichte der 7.

Glasgow was originally announced as the Scottish candidate over Edinburgh (which hosted the Games in 1970 and 1986, and the inaugural 2000 Commonwealth Youth Games) following a cost-benefit analysis by the Scottish Executive.  The venues  The Glasgow bid consisted of a mix of new and refurbished venues, linked by enhanced roads and public transport network, as well as an athlete's village, built specifically for the games and situated adjacent to key venues. Hampden Park, Scotland's National Football Stadium, would be the main venue for athletics and for the closing ceremony, while Celtic Park would be used for the opening ceremony.Glasgow plan makes best use of resources The Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, on the north bank of the River Clyde, would provide several multipurpose arena style venues as well as the planned Scottish National Arena for events such as gymnastics, boxing, wrestling, weightlifting, and judo as well as hosting associated entertainments events for the duration of the games. Kelvingrove Park, in the city's West End, already has five bowling greens installed for competitive use. A comprehensive upgrade and refurbishment of the park is underway, and the park is also capable of holding events such as triathlon and hockey, although Glasgow Green could be a possible alternative venue for the latter events. Kelvingrove Park is situated close to the SECC and is adjacent to the Kelvin Hall, which could also potentially host several indoor events. Ibrox Stadium is the planned venue for the rugby sevens tournament. The shooting competition will likely take place at another outdoor venue in the city, such as Pollok Park or the military Dechmont ranges in Cambuslang. If rowing was included as an event, it would likely be held at Strathclyde Park, which hosted the 2006 Commonwealth Rowing Championships. A new Indoor Arena and Velodrome Complex is planned for Parkhead in the East End of the city, the velodrome itself will be opposite Celtic Park, which will be used for the opening ceremony. These venues would be built regardless of the outcome of Glasgow's bid, and would become the headquarters of sportscotland and Scottish Cycling, and could be expected to host events such as netball, squash, badminton and table tennis, as well as track cycling. Adjacent to this, a potential site for an athletes' village has also been identified in Dalmarnock. The village would be purpose-built to house 6,000 athletes and officials in 2,500 residential units and leave a legacy of regeneration in this deprived district of the city. Nearby Tollcross Park Aquatics Centre, which already has one Olympic standard 50 metre swimming pool, would be extensively upgraded, and a second 50-metre pool would be added for the Games' aquatic events. The Glasgow 2014 Bid Committee issued a list of 17 sports that they planned to host: * Athletics * Aquatics (Swimming and Diving) * Boxing * Badminton * Squash * Weightlifting * Bowls * Field hockey * Rugby sevens (men) * Netball (women) * Cycling * Shooting * Wrestling * Judo * Gymnastics * Table tennis * Triathlon The Scottish Government and Glasgow City Council have agreed to underwrite the costs of staging the Games. This will be on the basis of an 80/20 split, with an estimated 20% split costing the city ¬£288m to stage the event. 80% of the costs will be covered by the Executive with new money committed to the sports and major events budget. GB¬£1 billion will be spent on enhancements to the city's transport infrastructure by 2014, including completion of major motorway links, like the M74 and East End Regeneration Route, the Glasgow Airport Rail Link, improved city centre rail links as a result of the Glasgow Crossrail scheme, light rapid transport to key facilities such as the SECC and possible refurbishment and extension of the Glasgow Subway as well as improvements to the River Clyde including new bridges and river-based transport.

Respect Renewal was led by Linda Smith, the National Chair, Leader and Nominating Officer of Respect, and was formed in November 2007. Its supporters included George Galloway, Ken Loach, Victoria Brittain, Salma Yaqoob and Nick Wrack. History In September 2007, Galloway wrote a letter to Respect's national council members saying that the party was \\"too disorganised\\" and \\"faced oblivion\\" unless it reformed its internal party management. This was the beginning of a dispute within Respect between Galloway and his supporters and the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) on the other side. On 3 November 2007, Galloway's camp announced plans to hold the Respect Renewal conference on 17 November, the same day as the planned national conference of Respect. The Respect Renewal conference was an open event and organisers claim 350 people attended, comparable with the Respect national conference, although the figure was disputed by Chris Harman in the SWP's International Socialism. This split continued with both Respect Renewal and the SWP-led faction claiming to be the real Respect. Respect Renewal, through Linda Smith, had control over the use of the Respect name in elections, while the SWP-led faction used the electoral label Left List, but did control the original Respect website. Both the Respect Renewal faction, as 'Respect (George Galloway)', and Left List stood in the 2008 London Assembly elections. Neither party won a seat or did as well as Respect did in the 2004 elections, but 'Respect (George Galloway)' outpolled Left List. The split was finally resolved in October 2008, when the Left List ended its claim on the Respect name. Criticisms of Respect Renewal The SWP has attributed the split within Respect to a shift to the right by George Galloway and his allies, motivated by electoralism (placing election-winning above other principles). This, according to the SWP leadership, led to attacks on the SWP as the most prominent left group in Respect. This interpretation of events is countered by Respect Renewal, which criticises the SWP for opportunism and lack of democracy.

The bidding race was won by the Glasgow 2014 bid after a 47‚Äì24 vote by the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) General Assembly on 9 November 2007 in Sri Lanka. Background The former Nigerian leader General Yakubu Gowon was the head of the Abuja 2014 Commonwealth Games bid team, he called for all Nigerians to support the games for the \\"glory of Nigeria\\". He suggested that Nigeria would be a prime location for the games because of its unity, serenity, topography and availability of standard sporting facilities. Abuja had recently hosted the All-Africa Games, The African regional version of the olympics, for which it constructed a world-class olympic stadium and games village. It was a hugely successful tournament with more than 7,000 athletes (and larger in size than any Commonwealth Games ever held). The 2014 Commonwealth Games would also be an integral part of national celebration plans for Nigeria's centenary. The Abuja bid received strong support from African Commonwealth members (which make up the bulk of the Commonwealth) as well as Australia, in what would be the largest multi-sport event to be held thus far on the continent. Despite its number of members, no African country has ever hosted the games and is that last major continent, excluding South America never to have acted as host. The website, www.abuja2014.org simple said \\"...completing the Commonwealth Games Circle\\" An article from Jonathan Clayton of the Times said: Abuja airport would be modernised to cater for the sheer capacity of the influx due to the games. This would further boost their bid to host the games. A state of the art light rail transit system was included in the bid documents. The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) administration announced that it had awarded a $841m contract for the construction of the system, which would be completed by 2012.  Sports  The Abuja 2014 Bid Committee issued a list of 17 sports that they planned to host: * Aquatics (Swimming and Diving) * Athletics * Badminton * Basketball * Boxing * Cycling (Road, Mountain and Track) * Gymnastics (Artistic and Rhythmic) * Field hockey * Judo * Bowls * Netball * Rugby sevens * Shooting * Squash * Table Tennis * Weightlifting * Wrestling The Abuja 2014 Commonwealth Games Bid, led by General Yakubu Gowon, submitted the Abuja 2014 Candidature File (Bid Book) on Wednesday, 9 May 2007 to the President of the Commonwealth Games Federation, Michael Fennel, at a ceremony in London where Glasgow also submitted its Candidature File. Members of the Commonwealth Games Federation Executive Board and representatives of the Scotland and Nigeria Communities were also present at the ceremony. Evaluation process The Evaluation Commission visited Abuja between 4 and 7 June 2007. The conclusions of the CGF Evaluation Commission were that \\"The Abuja Bid Committee submitted a Candidate City File which has the substantial and broad backing of the Nigerian Government. The Evaluation Commission submitted a number of issues to be clarified by Abuja and while most of these matters were addressed, a number of matters remain of concern and these are noted in the body of the report...and any decision to award the games to Abuja should be conditional on these matters being addressed\\" General Yakubu Gowon, said that his country was also \\"confident\\", despite the adverse evaluation of its bid by a four-member team in September. The group's report found fault with the city's plans for budgeting, transport, legacy, marketing and venues. \\"As far as we are concerned our bid is not only an Abuja bid but an African bid,\\" said General Gowon. \\"We are going there for a good, good fight, remember I am a general.\\"Scotland and Nigeria await 2014 Commonwealth games verdict Final selection process \\"A vote for Abuja means a vote for whole of Africa,\\" appealed Nobel Peace Prize winner Bishop Desmond Tutu to delegates during the final video presentation to delegates before voting began.

He studied at the Technical Department of the Calvin College in Geneva (1920-1921) and completed his secondary education at the First Secondary School of Thessaloniki in 1923, being an excellent student at both institutions. Aged 12 years only, he won one of two of the prestigious Monteseigny Foundation scholarships. He studied Architecture at the Technical University in Graz (1924-1930) under Karl Hoffman and Friedrich Zotter. Married to: Antigoni Petrocheilou (1932-1935), Ekaterini (Ina) Pappou (1937-1945, granddaughter of Greek Prime Minister Dimitrios Rallis, cousin of Greek Prime Minister Georgios Rallis), Valentina Theotoki (1947-1957), Koula Kambani (1968-1972). One daughter: Elisabeth Sakellariou-Herzog (*1939). Pericles Sakellarios died on March 5, 1985 in Athens. Today his buildings have successfully stood the test of time and are recognised as defining contribution to Post-War Greek Architecture. =Career= 1931 At the beginning of his career, he worked for a short spell as an assistant to Andreas Kriezis (1887-1962). His projects include the remodeling the Old Royal Palace to accommodate the Greek Parliament and Senate. In 1931 he moved to Volos where he worked for the Technical Service of the Township of Pagases until 1935. In 1936 he returned to Athens where he was employed by the newly formed technical service of the Ministry of Public Health and Welfare. The period of 1936 to 1941 was the most creative periods in his life and career. During this time, in addition to numerous private commissions, he was appointed as the official architect of King George II of Greece. He remodeled the royal palace of Tatoi, the royal palace of Psychiko and Mon Repos in Corfu. 1941-1945 During the German-Italian Occupation he was held hostage by the Greek People's Liberation Army in December 1944, from which he was liberated by the Allied forces. 1946 Still working as a civil servant, he was chosen as the official representative of his Ministry to travel to Britain and the United States in order to visit public buildings (mainly hospitals) and meet with experts. In late 1946 he abandoned his career as a civil servant and set up his practice as a freelance architect in Athens. From 1955 to 1961 he formed a collaboration with Manolis Vourekas (1905-1992) and Prokopis Vassiliadis (1912-1977). Projects resulting from this collaboration include the avant-garde Astir Beach and resort facilities in Glyfada (1955‚Äì58), the public beach in Vouliagmeni and the Argo and Okeanis restaurants (1959‚Äì61). In 1959 he was chosen by Walter Gropius as an associate of the architectural firm The Architects Collaborative for the construction of the new US Embassy in Athens. In 1966 he set up his first joint practice under the name ‚Äú P.A. Sakellarios and Associates‚Äù. His partners were his daughter Elisabeth Sakellariou-Senkowsky, her husband Hermann Senkowsky and his future wife Koula Kambani. Sakellarios was a member of the Technical Chamber of Greece, the Architect's Association, the Hellenic Architectural Society. He served as a board member of the International Union of Architects (UIA). He acted as technical advisor to the Greek National Tourism Organization and to the Psychiko Community. In 1966 he was designated Commander of the Royal Order of the Phoenix, an honor awarded to him for his contribution to the country‚Äôs reconstruction. In 1982, the Technical University of Graz awarded him an honorary diploma for his exceptional half-century of professional practice. =Influence on modern Greek architecture= Pericles Sakellarios was one of the leading figures in Greek architecture between 1936 and 1962.

(29 April 2010) Sanjit 'Bunker' Roy The 2010 TIME 100. TIME. Retrieved on 2 June 2012. History Bunker Roy is the founder of what is now called Barefoot College. After conducting a survey of water supplies in 100 drought prone areas, Roy established the Social Work and Research Centre in 1972. Its mission soon changed from a focus on water and irrigation to empowerment and sustainability. The programs focused on siting water pumps near villages and training the local population to maintain them without dependence on outside mechanics, providing training as paramedics for local medical treatment, and on solar power to decrease dependence and time spent on kerosene lighting. Roy has been named one of the 50 environmentalists who could save the planet by the Guardian and one of the 100 most influential people in the world by TIME magazine. Night Schools were begun that allowed students who worked to support their families during the day to still receive training. The organisation has utilised a system of training the trainers to bring skills training to villages. In 1997, Kamala Devi became first female solar engineer trained by the college's programs. She continued to work with the college. In 2012, she became the head of the solar unit at Kadampura. Methodology Barefoot College founder Bunker Roy speaking about the programs in January 2019 The programs are influenced by the Gandhian philosophy of each village being self- reliant. The policy of the Barefoot College is to take students, primarily women from the poorest of villages and teach them skills such as installing, building and repairing solar lamps and waterpumps without requiring them to read or write. In extreme cases, there are students without verbal fluency in the languages of their teachers. The participating villages create a Village Energy and Environment Committee which determines the rates the villagers will pay for the solar panels and identifies which of the poorest residents of the town will go to the college for training. The students receive 6-month training program learning about solar panels and storage batteries before returning home where they maintain and repair the systems. The college does not give out any degrees or certificates. V. Krishna has described the approach as \\"de-mystifying high technology\\" to rural villages to show that with the right training, \\"the uneducated and semi-literate can operate and manage\\" items like solar panels and water pumps. Rajasthan's traditional art of puppetry has been utilised by the college to \\"spread information on health, education and human rights\\". Campus The buildings used for the school have dirt floors and no chairs so that \\"poor students feel comfortable\\". The campus sits on 8 acres, has rainwater harvesting design and was built by the students. Cross-cultural collaboration In 2012, the Barefoot College became the first NGO partner with UNESCO's Global Partnership for Girls' and Women's Education. A UNDP funded program of India's Ministry of External Affairs brings women from villages in rural Africa (which do not have electricity) to the school for training, after which they return with new skills to install solar electricity in their villages. The college entered into an agreement in 2012 to expand the programs for students from Fiji. The documentary film Solar Mamas, funded by the Skoll Foundation and the Sundance Institute, follows a Jordanian woman as she joins with other women from around the world to participate in the solar engineering training at Barefoot College. An exhibition of photographs taken by the students of the Barefoot College was presented at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London.

Eliyahu Dobkin (, 31 December 1898 ‚Äì 26 October 1976) was a leading figure of the Labor Zionism movement, a signatory of the Israeli Declaration of Independence and a founder of the Israel Museum. He was also active in the Jewish Agency and the World Zionist Organisation. Biography Eliyahu Dobkin was born in Babruysk in the Russian Empire (today in Belarus) to a religious-Zionist family. His father, Yosef, worked in the lumber and banking industries, and was a member of the Mizrahi movement. Dobkin was schooled in a heder and gymnasium and later studied in Kharkiv (today in Ukraine), where he founded the Zionist student movement HaHaver in 1914. In 1917 he joined the HeHalutz movement founded in the same year by Joseph Trumpeldor. After World War I the family fled the Bolsheviks and settled in Bia≈Çystok in Poland. In 1921 he was elected general secretary of the world HeHalutz movement, which was headquartered in Warsaw. There he met Simcha Blass, who would later marry Dobkin's sister Yehudit. On 6 June 1932 Dobkin immigrated to Mandate Palestine with his wife and daughter and settled in Tel Aviv. That year he became a member of the Histadrut trade union. Between 1933 and 1968 he was a member of the Zionist Workers' Committee. In 1936 he joined the Jewish Agency, and headed its immigration department during World War II with the responsibility for rescuing Jews from Europe and illegal Jewish immigration to Mandate Palestine.The Signatories of the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs He became a member of its executive in 1946. When Israel declared independence on 14 May 1948, Dobkin was one of the designated signatories. However, at the time he was trapped in besieged Jerusalem, and added his signature at a later point. In the same year he became head of Keren Hayesod, a post he held until 1961. In 1951 he also took over as head of the Jewish Agency's youth and HeHalutz, serving until 1968. An art collector, Dobkin was head of the Bezalel museum and later founded the Israel Museum, sitting on its board until his death.

The defence of the French national airspace has always been based on 2 main aspects: * the peacetime security of the French airspace. This assignment is executed according to the fixed conditions of the French prime minister collaborating with the ministers of transport, foreign affairs, industrial, postal and communication services, interior management and colonial management. * the national military air defence consisting of all defensive and counteroffensive measures against eventual aggressors. In peacetime, the air defence and air operations command develops and evaluates all possible classic assets of air operations in all kinds of theatres. In times of crises or at war, the air defence and air operations command is responsible for all offensive and defensive air operations. The Commandement de la d√©fense a√©rienne et des op√©rations a√©riennes (CDAOA) is the air defence and air operations command, and has the following primary missions: * to decelerate and to evaluate any possible threats for the country by controlling the French and surrounding airspace by radar * to present an actual airpicture on a 24/7 basis to all civilian and military authorities on which strategic decisions may be made * to secure the airsuperiority in the national airspace at all times * to prevent or to stop the use of the national airspace by any kind of aggressor * to alert all civilian and military authorities in case of surprise air attacks CDAOA secondary, peacetime, missions are: * to command and control all military air traffic in cooperation with the civilian air traffic under authority of the minister of transport * to command and control all search and rescue operations in case of civilian or military air accidents In case of need the main CDAOA functions will always be guaranteed on all theatres by the activation of air, ground or sea mobile detection units of all French armed forces. These units may be deployed at any time to support the fixed operational systems.

The CCSDS Message Abstraction Layer (MAL) provides message abstraction and generic service patterns to the Mission Operation (MO) services defined in the CCSDS Mission Operations Services Concept.Mission Operations Services Concept , CCSDS 520.0-G-3. Green Book. Issue 3. December 2010  Service Layering  400pxA key feature of the MO Service Framework is the layering of services. While there are a range of potential services identified corresponding to different types of mission operations information that are exchanged within a system (status parameters, control actions, orbital data, mission timelines, etc.), these application level services are implemented in terms of a smaller set of generic interaction patterns that allow current status to be observed, operations to be invoked and bulk data transferred. This has two key benefits: it is inherently extensible, as new services can be overlaid on the existing common services; and the investment made in MO applications is further isolated from the implementation technology. Technology adapters allow the underlying communications infrastructure to be changed (or bridged) with minimal impact on the applications themselves. This improves long-term maintainability, as missions often outlive the ground technology used to deploy them initially. The layers of the Mission Operations Service Framework are: * The Mission Operations (MO) Layer * The Common Services Layer * The Message Abstraction Layer (MAL) * A message transport layer The interface between each layer is defined in the CCSDS standards and therefore implementations of the each layer can be replaced without change to other software.  Message Abstraction  To provide implementation language and message transport independence all operations of a service must be defined by a language/platform/encoding agnostic specification. The MAL defines this set of basic data types and how they must be used to build up the messages that make up the operations of a service. This only then has to be mapped once, in an MO standard, to a specific implementation language or transport encoding to apply to all services that are defined in terms of the MAL. In addition to the patterns of interaction and the abstract API the MAL provides support for the following: ‚Äì generic concepts, such as domain, session and zone; ‚Äì generic facilities such as access control (authentication and authorisation) and Quality of Service.  Patterns of interaction  An operation of a service can be decomposed to a set of messages exchanged between a service provider and consumer and form a pattern of interaction. Analysis of the services given in reference shows that there are a limited number of these patterns of interaction that can be applied to all currently identified services. Standardising a pattern of interaction, which defines the sequence of messages passed between consumer and provider, makes it possible to define a generic template for an operation of a service. The MAL defines this limited set of generic interaction patterns (templates) that must be used by services defined in the MO service framework. Each operation of a service is defined in terms of one of the MAL interaction patterns. By defining a pattern and stating that a given operation is an example of that pattern, the operation definition can focus on the specifics of that operation and rely on the standard pattern to facilitate this. For example, an operation ‚ÄòdoFoo‚Äô may be defined that is an example of a pattern called ‚ÄòSUBMIT‚Äô. This operation has two parts, the pattern of messages that are exchanged (the ‚ÄòSUBMIT‚Äô pattern) and the meaning of those messages and what ‚ÄòdoFoo‚Äô does. By defining the pattern as a standard (‚ÄòSUBMIT‚Äô) the service specification that defines ‚ÄòdoFoo‚Äô only need define the meaning of the messages and what the operation does. The MAL defines this set of patterns.  Advantages  A benefit of implementing multiple services over a message abstraction layer is that it is easier to bind these to different underlying technologies and protocol encodings. All that is required is an ‚Äòadapter‚Äô layer between the MAL and the underlying protocol to enable all services over that technology. Hence the same service can be implemented over ground-based network technologies and middleware, or it could even be carried across the space link itself. The services themselves provide the ‚Äòplug-and-play‚Äô interface for applications, allowing them to be integrated and deployed wherever is appropriate for the mission. There are no performance overheads as the MAL layer is conceptual and can be optimized out using code generators.Mission Operations Future Trends  Disadvantages  The MAL will not support features of the underlying protocol beyond the \\"least common denominator\\" defined in the MAL. Messaging features (e.g. threading model, QoS, etc.) are limited to a simpler subset that represent the intersection of all of the underlying middleware options. However, feature of an underlying protocol may be selected through configuration. An adapter layer between MAL and the underlying protocol, plus specifications for language bindings, are still required. Implementations must adhere to these specifications for interoperability. Thus MAL takes on the characteristics of becoming new middleware standard in itself. The MAL adapters and the MAL language binding specifications must be maintained as the underlying middleware standards for the plug-ins evolve. However, the use of the MAL removes any direct dependence of the application on the protocol technologies and therefore it is possible to isolate any evolution to lower adapter layers. MAL precludes the use of service contracts as the centerpiece defining a data-driven service architecture.  Implementations  Two independent implementations are required by CCSDS procedures, these have been implemented by ESA and CNES. Both Agencies are working towards releasing under open source licences.

In the Hawke Government he held ministerial office as Minister for Social Security (1983‚Äì1984) and Minister for Community Services (1984‚Äì1987). He was a general practitioner before entering politics. Early life Grimes was born on 4 October 1937 in Albury, New South Wales. He was the older of two children born to Nancy (n√©e O'Neill) and Walter Grimes; his father worked as a fitter and turner with New South Wales Railways. He was educated at Albury High School for three years, but after his mother's death from bowel cancer he and sister were sent to live with an aunt in Sydney. Grimes completed his education at Fort Street High School and went on to study medicine at the University of Sydney (MBBS 1962). He excelled at sport, playing inter-school rugby union for Fort Street, junior rugby league for North Sydney, and Australian football for Sydney University. Medical career Grimes married Margaret Schofield in 1960, with whom he had four children. He completed his clinical training at Royal North Shore Hospital and his internship at Royal Hobart Hospital in Tasmania, subsequently accepting locum positions in Hobart, New Norfolk and Launceston. From 1965 to 1966 he lived in London and was the in-house doctor for Beaverbrook Newspapers. After returning to Australia he served as district medical officer at Cygnet and then opened a general practice in the Launceston suburb of Riverside. Politics Grimes joined the Australian Labor Party in 1968, after previously joining the British Labour Party during his time in England. Grimes was elected to the Senate at the 1974 federal election, taking office immediately due to the preceding double dissolution. In 1976, he was elected to Gough Whitlam's shadow cabinet with the sixth-highest number of votes. He was given the social security portfolio. In March 1980, Grimes was suspended from parliament for 24 hours for using the words \\"pimp\\" and \\"fascist\\" and accusing Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser of \\"setting up\\" a demonstration outside a nursing home at which nine people were arrested. After the ALP won the 1983 election, Grimes was appointed Minister for Social Security in the Hawke Government. He was also elected Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate. In a cabinet reshuffle in 1984 he was given the new position of Minister for Community Services. Grimes underwent a triple bypass operation in June 1985 and returned to work in August. In October 1986, Grimes announced that he would not seek re-election. He resigned from Parliament in April 1987, but the casual vacancy was not immediately filled because the Tasmanian Parliament stalemated over the appointment of the Labor Party's nominee as replacement senator, John Devereux. Later life Between 1987 and 1991, Grimes was Australian Ambassador to the Netherlands. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia in January 1992. In May 1992, he was announced as the chairman of the Australian National Council on AIDS.

It is the largest indoor shopping centre in Fife and is one of the largest single-level indoor shopping centres in Scotland with around of (gross) floorspace. The centre has some of the highest levels of footfall in Fife and currently contains over 100 shop units as well as a variety of cafes, the town's central library and the Rothes Halls- the town's theatre/civic centre. A bingohall, cinema and ten pin bowling alley sit adjacent to the shopping complex. Glenrothes bus station is located next to thesoutheast end of the centre. A M&S; Foodhall, an Iceland Food Warehouse and a parade of shops and restaurants was completed in late 2018/early 2019 sitting adjacent to the shopping centre at North Street. Key stores in the Kingdom Centre include Argos, Boots, Sports Direct, Iceland, JD Sports and New Look. History Bus station and Postgate, part of the first phase of the town centre shown in the 1970s = Phase 1= Glenrothes town centre was originally to be built on the same principles of the English new towns such as Stevenage and Bracknell. The centre would comprise a series of shopping streets and squares separated from traffic. The first phase of the Kingdom Centre was built as large modern pedestrian square. A large glazed roof and a modern fountain were incorporated as features in the design. The Golden Acorn Hotel, the town's Post Office and a bus turning circle were all included as part of the development. A Co-Op Department store opened in 1964 at the eastern entrance to the square and a town clock was built as a feature adjacent to the store. Town Clock & former Co-Op department store built in the 1960s =Phase 2= The design of the first phase had a number of problems, including a leaking glass roof on the main square, vandalising of the public fountain and experiencing wind tunnel effects due to open and exposed entrances to the square. In 1976 a decision was taken to remove the glazed roof and the fountain and roof over the square at shop fascia height creating an internalised space. The shopping centre was also extended west to the point where Falkland Square is now. A Woolworths store (now Homebargains) was built to anchor the west end of the centre. A Presto supermarket (latterly Dunnes Stores) and the New Glenrothes House office block were built as later additions to the second phase. =Phase 3= Unicorn Square, built in the 1980s In 1982 a third phase was built extending the centre further west. The domed Unicorn Square was the principle feature of the third phase and Unicorn House, an office block with distinctive reflective glass, was built to the north of the development. A Gateway supermarket (now New Look, Poundworld and Store 21) anchored the third phase of the shopping centre when it opened. =Phase 4= In 1993, with the winding up of the Glenrothes Development Corporation (GDC) on the horizon, a fourth phase was built. This was partially funded with a central government grant to provide any last major projects for the new town. The fourth phase incorporated the Rothes Halls, a multi-purpose community facility with a caf√©, theatre, library and conference facilities. A major feature of the fourth phase is Rothes Square complete with a pyramid- shaped glass roof, a hanging triangular clock, circular feature floor design and an \\"alfresco\\" style caf√©. A Somerfield supermarket (latterly a Co-Op but currently vacant) anchored the fourth phase of the centre when it first opened. Rothes Square, Glenrothes Town Centre =Future proposals= A Glenrothes town centre action plan has been developed to create a vision for the wider town centre area. This was informed by a summit that was held in March 2013 which was attended by representatives of the local business community, voluntary groups and other individuals with an interest in the future of Glenrothes Town Centre. In May 2013, it was agreed at Glenrothes Area Committee to approve the Glenrothes Town Centre Action Plan. A range of projects are being delivered to assist in the regeneration of the town centre. Older parts of the Kingdom Shopping Centre at Albany Gate are proposed to be demolished.

History  Panasas is a computer data storage product company and is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. Panasas received seed funding from Mohr Davidow Ventures (MDV) and others. The first Panasas products were shipped in 2004, the same year that Victor M. Perez became CEO. Faye Pairman became CEO in 2011.  Technology  Panasas developed an extension for managing parallel file access in the Network File System, which was later integrated in Parallel NFS (pNFS), part of the NFS version 4.1 specification, published by the Internet Engineering Task Force as RFC 5661 in January 2010. pNFS described a way for the NFS protocol to process file requests to multiple servers or storage devices at once, instead of handling the requests serially. Panasas supports DirectFlow, NFS, Parallel NFS and Server Message Block (also known as CIFS) data access protocols to integrate into existing local area networks. Panasas blade servers manage metadata, serving data for DirectFlow, NFS and CIFS clients using 10 Gigabit Ethernet. Panasas systems provide data storage and management for high- performance applications in the biosciences, energy, media and entertainment, manufacturing, government and research sectors. = ActiveStor = The ActiveStor product line is a scale-out NAS appliance that integrates hybrid storage hardware (hard drives and solid state drives), the PanFS parallel file system, its proprietary DirectFlow data access protocol, and the industry standard NFS and CIFS network protocols.  ActiveStor Ultra  ActiveStor Ultra (introduced in November 2018) is the newest generation of the Panasas ActiveStor storage system and features a re-engineered, portable file system that delivers performance and reliability on suitably qualified, industry standard storage hardware platforms. Each ActiveStor Ultra has four storage nodes, and each node has six HDD drive slots and two SSD drive slots. Each node supports six to eight HDDs or zero to two SSDs. Each ActiveStor Ultra can deliver 6-7.5 GB/s per 4U enclosure, depending on the configuration. With a minimum configuration of three ActiveStor Ultra enclosures, the total bandwidth performance is expected to be between 18-22 GB/s. ActiveStor Ultra is designed for extreme performance and extreme scalability configurations and supports flexible networking options. The ActiveStor Ultra/PanFS 8 solution is aimed at HPC shops, as well as enterprises who need the kind of performance that parallel file systems can afford. For enterprise customers especially, the approach is intended to give them the kind of simplicity and low TCO that they demand. ActiveStor 20 (now ActiveStor Classic) was announced in August 2016 with increased capacity, using larger and faster disks. In November 2017, Panasas released the ActiveStor Director 100https://www.storagereview.com/panasas_announces_nextgen_activestor_scaleout_nas_solution and the ActiveStor Hybrid 100 (now ActiveStor Prime), which disaggregated the Director Blade, the controller node of Panasas storage system, from the storage nodes. In November 2018, Panasas introduced ActiveStor Ultra, which featured a completely re-engineered portable file system (PanFS¬Æ 8) running on industry standard hardware.  PanFS  Panasas created the PanFS clustered file system as single pool of storage under a global filename space to support multiple applications and workflows in a single storage system. PanFS supports DirectFlow (pNFS), NFS and CIFS data access protocols simultaneously. PanFS 7.0 added a FreeBSD operating foundation and a GUI that supports asynchronous push notification of system changes without user interaction. In November 2018, Panasas introduced PanFS 8, an intelligent, POSIX compliant parallel file system that incorporates the latest software innovations and runs on Linux to enable easy portability to new industry standard hardware. PanFS 8 includes the newly re-engineered Storage Node software stack for use on the new ActiveStor Ultra family of Storage Nodes. PanFS is now theoretically portable across a much wider array of hardware, opening up the possibility of hosting the file system on third-party storage platforms. The file system‚Äôs portability also offers Panasas the flexibility to use different hardware suppliers for future versions of its own ActiveStor hardware ‚Äì for both for the Director and storage modules. That has the advantage of keeping costs down, while potentially offering even more options for customers. PanFS 8 is optimized to match the object access and update patterns common in mixed workloads.  DirectFlow DirectFlow is a parallel data access protocol designed by Panasas for ActiveStor. DirectFlow avoids protocol I/O bottlenecks by accessing Panasas storage directly and in parallel. DirectFlow was originally supported on Linux, and expanded in April 2016 to support Apple's MacOS.

Miabi, the Dishi Capital, is located West of Mbuji-Mayi. The territory of the Bakwa Dishi lies on approximately , which is known as the Miabi territory. They speak Tshiluba in spite of their history with the Lunda Empire, and their dialect is considered the oldest and purest among the Luba-Kasai.  Origins  In the 17th century, the Luba Prince Tshibinda Ilunga son of Ilunga Mbili leaves the Luba Empire ruled by his brother Kalala Ilunga and marries Queen Naweej of the Lunda. He brings with him the Luba customs (such as the Luba style of ceremonial chieftainship) and culture and religion introduced by his father; and enlarges the Kingdom to become an Empire rivaling his brother, even greatly surpassing him. He extends the empire to the south of current Zambia, east of Angola and south west of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Tshibinda Ilunga is crowned Emperor and is praised as a \\"God-King\\" or \\"Anointed One\\" and civilizing hero. His son Mwata Mutomb succeeds him and becomes the first Mwata Yamvo. Though his father was praised as a civilizing hero; Mwata Mutomb‚Äôs authority is disputed by the Lunda who consider him and his family as foreigners. Because of numerous civil wars, he and the rest of the Imperial family are forced to capitulate and thus cut all ties with the Lunda people and begin a migration which Mwata Mutomb leads. At the death of Queen Naweej, it is one of her brother's son who is crowned; he assumes the style and title of Mwata Yamvo which all future Lunda rulers will assumes.  Founding  At the death of Mwata Mutomb, his son Mbuyi Tshitenge succeeded him, then Kamanga Matunlungu, then finally Kafwembe succeeded him in place of his father Mwanza Mukala. At his inauguration Kafwemb chose to carry the title of MBAYI which means prince or Lord in Chilunda. Mbayi Kafwemb leads the migration westward and finally settles down around a salted lake named Dishi which is now drained. The descendant of Tshibinda Ilunga took the name of the lake and today they still carry the name of the Bakwa Dishi. It was at the end of the 17th century that Mbayi Kafwemb firmly established the Kingdom of the Bakwa Dishi and was prosperous in the business of salt.  Kingship  The power is transmitted by blood in the Luba culture, but with the Bakwa Dishi in particular, it is transmitted two ways. First by blood, then inside the bloodline, it can be transmitted by wealth. In other words, if one is not a member of the Royal Family he will never be able to rule; but if he is of the Royal Family but is not wealthy he will not be able to rule either. When the King dies, it is either one of his brothers, sons or nephews that can replace him. There is no pre-determined order. It is only their moral and mystical aptitudes as well material capabilities that will determine which one will be chosen by the King as his heir. In the event that the King dies without designating his successor, it is those same aptitudes and conditions that will be taken into account by the members of the Royal Family to designate the heir to the throne. By moral aptitude, it is understood that the life of a King must be an example. He must be good, just, courageous, and especially showcase a sense of leadership. By mystical aptitude, it is understood that the King has been initiated to different degrees of traditional knowledge. Finally, by material capabilities, it means that the King must have enough riches to take care of his subjects.  Today  The Bakwa Dishi realm is composed of 23 different clans. Each clan is headed by a Chief. Here is the list of the different Bakwa Dishi clans: *Mbayi *Muyombo *Nyandu *Mbuyi *Tshimuna *Kayombo *Tshimungu *Kalonji *Mpemba *Ndumbi *Kasansa *Lukanda *Kanda *Kaye *Mbadi *Tshiala *Mushingala *Mbiya *Mulenga *Ntembwe *Nsumba *Mbwanga *Lubashi The ruling clan of the Bakwa Dishi is that of the Bena Mbayi (sons of Mbayi), which is led by the royal family under Andr√©-Philippe Futa. After the death of the Kazadi Diofua, the last King of the Bakwa Dishi; Futa who was the chosen heir was to young to rule. His father and uncles assumed the regency while he continued his studies which eventually took him overseas. After many years out of the D. R. Congo, Andre-Philippe Futa was called by President Joseph Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo, hence came back and served in the government and eventually became Minister of Finance. During election 2006, he led the multi-party Alliance of the Presidential Majority (French: Alliance pour la majorit√© pr√©sidentielle, AMP) as Coordinator and helped Kabila win the election. He was elected Senator of Kasai Oriental in 2007. Andre-Philippe Futa Mudiumbula Tshitumbu is planned to be recognized as the traditional ruler and crowned King/grandchief of the Bakwa Dishi and Miabi.

Kaggia was a member of the Mau Mau Central Committee. After independence he became a Member of Parliament. He established himself as a militant, fiery nationalist who wanted to serve the poor and landless people. Because of this he fell out irreconcilably with Jomo Kenyatta. Early life Kaggia was born in 1922, at Dagoretti, now part of Nairobi, where his father had moved from his home district of Muranga District.Kaggia, 2012: 1. Two years later his father moved back to Murang‚Äôa. Kaggia schooled at Santamor Estate and later at the Church Missionary Society School at Kahuhia. Kaggia did very well at the exams and was selected for the famous Alliance High School. Unfortunately, his father was not able to raise the school fee and Kaggia had to take up a clerical job at the District Commissioners‚Äô Office at Murang‚Äôa. When the Second World War broke out, Kaggia was moved to the military recruiting office. Despite hating war, Kaggia decided to join the army to seize the opportunity to travel to the Middle East. When the War Office in London decided to create a unit in Britain to rehabilitate captured African soldiers, Kaggia applied and got the post of company quarter-sergeant, the first African to get this post. Most of the work in the army was routine and boring. During the years in the army Kaggia engaged in many correspondence courses (journalism, trade unionism and political science) which later would serve him well during his political career. His experiences in the army made him aware of the evils from racial discrimination and colonialism. In his opinion the foreign religions in Kenya were a stepping stone to colonialism and his people had to be liberated from this as well.Rosberg, 1985 (1966): 192-193. Kaggia‚Äôs religion (Dini ya Kaggia) Back in Kenya (1946) Kaggia denounced the church in the church. His objective was to create a purely African movement, divorced from European denominations and entirely independent of the European Church‚Äôs doctrine. The new doctrine should include African customs and traditions. Kaggia had large followings in Central Province. This alarmed the church and their leaders asked the government for help. Subsequently, many times Kaggia and his followers were arrested and imprisoned for holding illegal meetings.Kaggia, 2012: 49-55. Kinatti, 2008: 90-91 Nevertheless, Kaggia‚Äôs doctrine spread and he had followers from all denominations and his religion was spreading into other provinces, ultimately even reaching Nyanza.Rosberg, 1985: 193. Kaggia was opposed to giving the movement a name, but, the people started calling it Andu a Kaggia (Kaggia‚Äôs people). Later this became Dini ya Kaggia (Kaggia‚Äôs religion).Rosberg, 1985: 193. Kaggia saw that indeed his religion was liberating the minds of people. They were no longer humble, European-fearing people; now they had the courage to attack the mzungu government. Consequently, Kaggia decided to leave the religious work to others and shifted his attention from spiritual liberation to political liberation.Kaggia, 2012: 55. The Young Radical When Kenyatta was elected chairman of KAU in 1947 Kaggia joined KAU hoping that it would become more militant. However, at national level KAU was barely functioningSpencer, 1977: 225-6 and Kaggia shifted his interest to the trade unions. He admired the fire and militancy of leaders like Kubai en Makhan Singh. Kaggia founded the Clerks and Commercial Workers Union and in 1948 he became its chairman. This union became a member of the general union, the Labour Trade Union of East Africa. In 1950 Kaggia became president of Labour Trade Union of East Africa.Kaggia, 2012: 56 The trade unions had much support in Nairobi and they took over the KAU branch Nairobi in 1951. Kaggia was elected its general secretary. Later the trade unions tried to take over the national leadership of KAU but this failed when the president of KAU, Jomo Kenyatta, changed the election procedure at the last moment. This almost resulted in a split of KAU, but the ‚Äòmilitants‚Äô decided to remain in KAU for the sake of unity.Kaggia, 2012: 59; Spencer, 1977: 265. Kaggia started vernacular newspapers like Inoora ria Gikuyu and later Afrika Mpya to report KAU activities. These and other vernacular newspapers were instrumental in spreading the message of the militant leaders who advocated for independence. Kaggia was a leading member of the KAU Study Circle which assisted its members with drafting memomanda, resolutions and discussions papers. He was the President of the Anti Federation League. This league was set up to oppose the proposed Federation with Central Africa, which would strengthen the white settlers‚Äô political control of these territories. The Anti-Federation League succeeded in its objective as Kenya did not join the Federation when in 1953 the Central African Federation of three British colonies: Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and Nyasaland (now Malawi) was founded.Kaggia, 2012: 68-69. As a member of the African Advisory Council, Kaggia campaigned actively against the Nairobi municipal Council apartheid by-laws, which had created separate European, Asian and African areas in Nairobi. Kaggia considered it as one of his biggests achievements that these by-laws were repealed by the Municipal Council.Kaggia, 2012: 73. Despairing of constitutional change, he joined Mau Mau and sat on its central Committee.He admits as much on p. 116 of Kaggia 1975. On 20 October 1952, he, along with the rest of the Kapenguria Six, was arrested in Operation Jock Scott, and charged inter alia with managing Mau Mau, and being a senior member of it. He was convicted at trial, and imprisoned until September 1961. Thereafter, he was confined to his home district. On 17 November 1961, all restrictions were lifted. Independence and after In the 1963 elections, he won Kandara Constituency seat on a KANU ticket, and so had the distinction of a seat in independent Kenya's first parliament. Kaggia also served as a minister in the Kenyatta cabinet; his denunciations of corruption marked him out as a member of KANU's radical tendency. When Kenyatta and Mboya combined to purge the KANU left, he was one of their victims, with Kenyatta making the trip to Kandara to campaign against him. He joined Odinga's KPU, but eventually retired from active politics in 1974, after failing to recapture his seat. Kaggia was the leading Kenyan leftist of the colonial period; probably the strategic planner on Mau Mau's central committee; notably anti-racist;Kaggia made common cause with Asian workers and trade-unionists at a time when this was difficult and unpopular; after Uhuru, he strove to secure recognition of Kenyan Asians' part in the struggle for independence. See Adenekan. and uncompromisingly committed to the poor.He lived in, and campaigned for the dwellers of, one of Nairobi's biggest slums. See Adenekan. References Bibliography *Adenekan, Shola.

Turgeon was prepared for racing by Chantilly- based trainer Jonathan Pease Racing career At age three Turgeon's best 1989 performances in conditions races was a win in the Group 2 Prix de l'Esperance and a second in both the Prix Royal-Oak and the Prix Kergorlay. At age four in France he showed endurance with a win in the Group 2 Prix Vicomtesse Vigier over a distance of 3,100 meters (approximately 1.92 miles), and a second in the 3,100 meters Prix de Barbeville, and third in both the 4,000 meter Prix du Cadran and in the 3,100 Prix Royal-Oak. Sent to Weidenpesch Racecourse in Cologne, Germany, he ran second in the Group I Preis von Europa. Racing as a five-year-old, 1991 would be Turgeon's best year on the racetrack. He repeated as runner-up in the French Prix de Barbeville and in Rome, Italy was third in the then Group 3 Premio Roma Vecchia. Turgeon's wins in France came in the Group 2 Prix Kergorlay and a second consecutive victory in the Group 2 Prix Vicomtesse Vigier. The colt earned his first Group One win in September at the Curragh Racecourse in Ireland, capturing the Irish St. Leger. Back in France he won another Group One race in October, the Prix Royal-Oak. After his very successful 1991 campaign, Turgeon continued to race for another two years. His best major race results was a third-place finish in the 2¬Ω mile (approximately 4,000 meter) 1992 Ascot Gold Cup in England and a similar effort in that same race in 1993. In France he was third in the 1993 Prix de Barbeville and in Germany, finished second in the 3,200 meter Oleander-Rennen in Baden-Baden. Stud record Retired to stud duty in 1994, Turgeon sired a number of European stakes race winners particularly in steeplechase racing and in 2006 was the leading sire in France of jump racing horses. His progeny include Exotic Dancer who won several major steeplechases in England and Ireland and finished second to Kauto Star in the 2007 Cheltenham Gold Cup. At the time of his death in April 2019 he was still standing as a sire at the Haras du Mesnil stud in Savigne-l'Eveque, Sarthe and was the world's oldest active thoroughbred sire, aged 33.

Processing of the ore entails reduction of its aqueous extracts with sodium bisulfite to give sodium iodide. Via a comproportionation reaction, the sodium iodide is combined with the iodate salt to produce elemental iodine. Calcium iodate can be produced by the anodic oxidation of calcium iodide or by passing chlorine into a hot solution of lime in which iodine has been dissolved.

He came from an old noble family of France whose military tradition extended for several centuries. Efforts by the French Revolutionary government to remove him from his command failed when his soldiers refused to give him up. A big, loud-voiced man, he led from the front of his troops. Although the failure of his cavalry to deploy at the Battle of Stockach (1799) resulted in a court martial, he was exonerated and went on to serve in the Swiss campaign in 1799, at the Second Battle of Stockach, the Battle of Biberach, and later at Battle of Hohenlinden. He served under Michel Ney and Joachim Murat. He was killed in Murat's massive cavalry charge of the Battle of Eylau in 1807. Early life Born in an ancient noble family from the Languedoc, he entered the French royal army as a volunteer in 1769. After having served in the Corsican legion, he transferred in 1771 to a Dragoon regiment. From 1777, he served as an officer in the Dragoon Regiment of the Languedoc.This regiment was created in 1676 as the Languedoc-Dragons, becoming the Chasseurs du Languedoc in 1788, and the 6e R√©giment de Chasseurs in 1791.

Revolutionary Wars By contemporary accounts, d'Hautpoul was a big man, possibly taller than Joachim Murat, who was nearly six feet tall. Endowed with broad shoulders and a big voice. He spoke the language of the common soldier, and led from the front.Robert B. Bruce, Iain Dickie, Kevin Kiley. Fighting techniques of the Age of Napoleon.

Early in the French Revolution, commissioners visited the various regiments to weed out dangerous, and prospectively traitorous nobles; generally, the commissioners cowed the army into submission, but d'Hautpoul's cavalry regiment refused to be intimidated. When the commissioners came for their colonel, a scion of impoverished nobility, his soldiers refused to give him up: \\"No d'Hautpoul, no 6th Chasseurs.\\"John Robert Elting. Swords around the Throne: Napoleon's Grande Arm√©e. New York: Da Capo Press, 1997, , p. 38. Thus, despite his noble birth, at the exhortations of his soldiers he remained in the French Revolutionary Army.Bruce, 79. d'Hautpoul served in the 1794‚Äì1799 campaigns against the armies of the First and Second Coalitions. In April 1794, d'Hautpoul was promoted in the field to general of brigade and he commanded the brigade under both Jacques Desjardin and his successor, Fran√ßois S√©verin Marceau-Desgraviers. After the battle of Fleurus, his unit was transferred to the division of Fran√ßois Joseph Lefebvre. In June 1795, his provisional rank of general of brigade was made permanent by the Committee of Public Safety. He distinguished himself in a fight at Blankenberge on 13 September 1795. In June 1796, d'Hautpoul was promoted to general of division and inspector of the cavalry. At Altenkirchen, he was wounded in the shoulder by a musket ball.Haythornthwaite, p. 27. After his recovery, d'Hautpoul was given command of the heavy cavalry of the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse under General Paul Grenier. After Neuwied, he was transferred to the Army of England under command of Lazare Hoche. When the French Directory abandoned the idea of an invasion of England, he was again deployed on the German front, this time as part of the Army of the Danube. After the French loss at the Battle of Ostrach, his Cavalry reserve protected the French retreat from Pfullendorf. A few days later, after failing to lead a timely charge at the Battle of Stockach, he was suspended on orders of the Army commander, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, who blamed d'Hautpoul for the defeat. Acquitted by a court-martial in Strasbourg, d'Hautpoul resumed his duties at the end of July 1799, having missed the critical actions at the First Battle of Zurich. In 1799, d'Hautpoul commanded cavalry brigades under Ney, Lecourbe and Baraguey d'Hilliers in the rest of the campaign in northeastern Switzerland. In the German campaign of 1800, he served under Moreau and distinguished himself at the battles of Biberach and Hohenlinden, during which his heavy cavalry was instrumental in disrupting the Austrian infantry defenses.Haythornthwaite, p. 28. Napoleonic wars Le G√©n√©ral d'Hautpoul √† cheval by √âdouard Detaille, 1912 In July 1801, First Consul Bonaparte appointed d'Hautpoul as inspector-general of the cavalry and then awarded him command of the cavalry in the camps of Compi√®gne and Saint-Omer. In August 1805, d'Hautpoul was given command of the 2nd division of cuirassiers under Joachim Murat. At Austerlitz, d'Hautpoul distinguished himself by leading his heavy cavalry into the Russian center at the Pratzen heights, breaking the infantry squares. In 1804, Napoleon made him a grand officer (grand cordon) of the L√©gion d'honneur and a senator, which carried with it an annual income of 20,000 francs. In the War of the Fourth Coalition, d'Hautpoul served at Jena and in the capture of L√ºbeck. Transferred to the Corps of Marshal Bessi√®res in December 1806, he again served under Murat in the maneuvers in East Prussia in the Winter of 1807.Tony Broughton, French Chasseur-√†-Cheval Regiments and the Colonels Who Led Them 1791‚Äì1815: 6e Regiment de Chasseurs-√†-Cheval.

Accessed 30 January 2010. =Battle of Eylau= When military activity resumed in the winter of 1807, Napoleon hoped to overwhelm a Russian rearguard at Hof near Eylau, which was called \\"Preussisch Eylau\\" (and is now within the borders of the Russian Kaliningrad Oblast). He ordered his dragoons to take a bridge; they failed and suffered severe casualties. D'Hautpoul and his cuirassiers‚Äîheavy cavalry of big men on big horses‚Äîthundered over the bridge and scattered the Russian rearguard. As the retreating infantry fled, d'Hautpoul's cuirassiers captured four guns and two standards. Napoleon was so pleased with d'Hautpoul and his cuirassiers that he embraced the six-foot man in front of his division the next day. In his own turn, d'Hautpoul was so pleased that he announced first, to have such a compliment, he must be willing to die for his emperor, and second, to his troops: \\"The Emperor has embraced me on behalf of all of you. And I am so pleased with you that I kiss all your arses.\\"Bruce, p. 77. The pursuit of the Russian troops continued. On 7 February 1807, the French arrived outside the village of Eylau, as night was falling. In some confusion, the Imperial coach rumbled into the village, although the Emperor was setting up his camp a few kilometers away. The Russian patrol in the village chased off the coach driver and his men and plundered the Emperor's belongings; in turn, the Imperial escort chased them off. More and more men were sent into the engagement, and in the end the French took the village when the Russians withdrew. Both sides lost 4,000 men in the contest for the village and the Emperor's nightshirt. Settling for the night, they prepared to engage the next day.Digby Smith. Charge: Great Cavalry Charges of the Napoleonic Wars. London: Greenhill, 2007, p. 66. The next morning, the two armies of unequal strength faced each other across frozen fields fissured by ice-covered streams and ponds, which were in turn covered by snow and drifts. The snow and gloom meant that neither side was aware of the inequalities of men and artillery. Napoleon opened the engagement by sending Soult's's corps, which successfully pushed the Russian right flank back, nearly turning the Russian force. To follow up on this success, he ordered Pierre Augereau's force to attack the left-center. No sooner had Augereau and VII Corps, plus St. Hilaire's division, sallied out when a sudden snow storm engulfed the battlefield. In white-out conditions, Augereau's entire corps disappeared in a flurry of whirling snow. When the snow cleared, friend and foe alike discovered that the first units onto the field had wandered off course. The line of march should have taken them directly to the Russian flank; have no point of reference, they had instead followed the terrain and led the entire corps parallel to the Russian line, along with a V-shaped formation in which the left and center merged, and directly into the face of the Russian 70‚Äìgun batteries.Smith, p. 70. The artillery, although shocked to find a French Corps advancing straight toward them, immediately opened fire, as did the Russian infantry on both sides of Augereau's corps. The result was devastating. Five thousand French soldiers fell in a matter of minutes and the entire engagement stood on the brink of disaster. Not only did they face the Russian fire, but the French artillery pounded them as well. Augereau's Corps melted under the withering fire, the bayonets of the Russians, and the onslaught of the cavalry; as they retreated to their own lines, Napoleon was nearly captured at the Eylau churchyard, where he had established a lookout post, but his escort cavalry chased the Russians away. Charge at Eylau To fill the breach left by Augereau's decimated corps, Napoleon ordered Murat's cavalry reserve, 80 squadrons of 10,700 cavalrymen, into action at 10:30 in the morning. They had to cover of snow-covered, obstacle-filled ground, which they could not do at a gallop. Murat's Reserve charged into the Russian squares in two columns: Grouchy's cavalry, d'Hautpoul's cuirassiers and General Louis Lepic's grenadiers--24 squadrons in total--were flank to flank when they hit the Russian center. This was the occasion of Lepic's famous comment, \\"Heads up, by God! those are bullets, not turds!\\"Smith, p. 71. Grouchy, Lepic, and d'Hautpoul's horse broke the center, wheeled, and charged a second time. On the second charge, they broke the second formation of squares; at this point, Grouchy's men were forced back, but d'Hautpoul's cuirassiers pounded forward, reaching the Russian reserve.Bruce, pp. 86‚Äì88; Terry J. Senior. The Top Twenty French Cavalry Commanders: #16 General Louis Lepic. Napoleon Series. Robert Burnham, editor in chief. 2002. Accessed 30 January 2010. At this point, the horses were nearly blown, but d'Hautpoul's cuirassiers charged the third line, which they also broke. The Russian Cossacks, assembled in the reserve, entered the melee, but their light horses were no match for the French mounts, big horses confiscated from the Prussians the previous year. The Russian infantry had started to reform their squares behind d'Hautpoul's men. During this charge, d'Hautpoul was struck by artillery grapeshot and badly wounded.Bruce, pp. 77‚Äì78.

These disagreed on the method of treatment. Against the advice of the military surgeon, Larrey, d'Hautpoul refused to have his leg amputated and he died a few days later.Terry J. Senior.

At the Battle of Eylau, Murat's 10,700-man cavalry charged the Russian lines. D'Hautpoul himself led three charges into the Russian infantry squares. There is some disagreement in the records about his actual date of death: the original death record of the parish at Eylau indicates he died of wounds on 1 February 1807, but this was before the battle, and it is possible that the pastor simply left off a digit in his record, or, more likely, that the record was transcribed incorrectly. Other records suggest that he died the day after the battle (8 February), on 11 February, or on 14 February. Originally buried at Worienen, Ernst Wilhelm Gegner (Pfarrar). Sterbregister 1807 . Preus.

He is chiefly remembered for his death on the first ascent of the Matterhorn and for his climbing partnership (as a guide) with Edward Whymper. Career as a guide Croz began his guiding career in 1859 when he was engaged by William Mathews for an ascent of Mont Blanc. As well as making the first ascent of some of the most significant unclimbed mountains in the Alps ‚Äì the Grande Casse, Monte Viso, the Barre des √âcrins and the Aiguille d'Argenti√®re ‚Äì he also made the first traverse of many previously uncrossed cols, including the col des Ecrins, the col du S√©l√© and the col du Glacier Blanc in the Massif des √âcrins (all in 1862 with Francis Fox Tuckett, Peter Perren and Bartolomm√©o Peyrotte). In 1863, he climbed the Grandes Rousses with William Mathews, Thomas George Bonney and his brother Jean-Baptiste Croz, and in 1864 he made the first traverse of the br√®che de la Meije and the first traverse of the col de la Pilatte (with Edward Whymper, Horace Walker, A. W. Moore and Saas-Fee guide Christian Almer). Of the latter expedition, Whymper was later to write, Matterhorn accident The fatal accident on the Matterhorn occurred on the sunny snow slopes at the top right of the mountain. The accident on the Matterhorn, triggered by Hadow, in an engraving by Gustave Dor√©. Hadow is second from the bottom, with Croz below him. The snapped rope above Hudson and Douglas is clearly seen. Following eight failed attempts on the Matterhorn starting from 1861, Whymper was recalled to London in the summer of 1864 and offered the services of Croz to his friend Adams-Reilly, advising him to make an attempt on the mountain (all three had been in a party that had made the first ascent of Mont Dolent that year).Scrambles amongst the Alps, 6th edition, Editor's Introduction, p. vi This never came to anything, and the next year Croz was again employed by Whymper. Together with Christian Almer and Franz Biner they made the first ascent of the Grand Cornier, and the first ascent of Pointe Whymper on the Grandes Jorasses.Helmut Dumler and Willi P. Burkhardt, The High Mountains of the Alps, London: Diadem, 1994, p. 187. Dumler calls this 'the \\"moral\\" first ascent' of the Grandes Jorasses. Although Croz and Whymper, together with Christian Almer and Franz Biner, did not reach the highest point of the mountain (Pointe Walker, 4,208 m), they were the first to find a way to the summit ridge, and ascended the slightly lower summit of Pointe Whymper (4,148 m). Dumler writes 'here is [a] case where the formal credit is accorded to the successful party [Walker, Anderegg, Grange, Jaun, 1868)] after an earlier attempt [Croz et al.] had resolved most of the difficulties.' On the Matterhorn, Croz and Whymper tried a route via a couloir on the south-east face but were unsuccessful.The High Mountains of the Alps, p. 149 Croz then had to fulfil an engagement with Charles Hudson, during which ‚Äì together with T. S. Kennedy ‚Äì they made the first ascent of the Moine ridge of the Aiguille Verte, whilst Whymper attempted to join forces with the Valtournenche guide Jean-Antoine Carrel. When this proved impossible (Carrel instead leading an Italian party on an attempt on the Italian ridge of the mountain), Whymper teamed up with Lord Francis Douglas and the two Zermatt guides, Peter Taugwalder father and son. Eventually this party decided to share the attempt on their common objective of the H√∂rnli ridge with Croz and Hudson, who had been joined by Hudson's prot√©g√© ‚Äì the young, inexperienced and badly shod Douglas Hadow. After this party of seven successfully made the first ascent of the Matterhorn on 14 July 1865, the order on the rope during the descent was Croz going down first, followed by Hadow, then Hudson, Douglas, old Peter Taugwalder and Whymper, with young Peter Taugwalder bringing up the rear. According to Claire Engel, The rope (an old, thin and worn line) between Douglas and old Peter Taugwalder snapped, saving the remaining three members of the party ‚Äì Taugwalder father and son, and Whymper. Croz's body, together with those of Hudson and Hadow (but not Douglas), were recovered from the Matterhorn glacier. Croz was buried in the south side of Zermatt churchyard, on the other side from the graves of Hudson and Hadow.

They began early in the Ordovician with Proendoceras or similar genus which had developed endocones, replacing the diaphragms of the ellesmerocerid ancestor. Proterocameroceratids are long, straight or gently curved with a generally narrow siphuncle along the ventral margin. Septal necks are short, never quite reaching the previous septum and may vary in length ontogenically within a species. Connecting rings are thick and layered. Endocones are simple, especially in early forms but may be complex with secondary structures in later forms. The Proterocameroceratidae gave rise to the Piloceratidae early on, and later to the Manchuroceratidae and Chihlioceratidae, from which the Allotrioceratidae are derived, and later yet possibly to the Emmonsoceratidae and Najaceratidae. The Piloceratidae in turn may have given rise to the Endoceratidae although a proterocameroceratid ancestor remains possible. Proterocameroceratids were probably mobile bottom predators that moved from place to place over the sea floor in search of prey or escape. Their shell was on one hand a carry over from some Cambrian monoplacophoran ancestor, passed on through previous orders, and on the other both a hydrodynamic facilitator and protection. But the shells of nautiloids, such as the proterocameroceratids was also an impediment to true squidy or fishy swimming. They could not have had fins for propulsion or steering, only the hyponome for spontaneous jet mobility and their tentacles by which to crawl across the sea floor and to grasp at things. The diagnostic endocones in the early part of the siphuncle balanced the weight of the animal living at the front of the shell. The Proterocameroceratidae ultimately suffered the extinction at the end of the Ordovician, but not before having given rise to a variety of endocerid families. They remain a subject of interesting research. References *Flower, R. H. 1955, Status of Endoceroid Classification; Jour. Paleon.

Back up rings are commonly used with O-rings, lip seals, and as reciprocating shaft seals. They are also used for piping connections joining two different materials - typically one flexible and one rigid.  Seals  When sealing the piston inside a pneumatic cylinder, a soft and flexible material is required to prevent leakage, but those same properties may leave the seal material vulnerable to being pulled out of its seat and then pinched or torn in the narrow space between piston and cylinder wall. If the joint cannot be redesigned, or a more resistant elastomer used, then the solution may be direct reinforcement with a stiffer material - in the form of a hard inner ring in this case. A second function can be to hold the elastomer in place while a machine is being assembled, as geometry may prevent the seal from being directly checked after assembly. =Rubber Contoured Back-Up Ring Size Chart= Contoured back-ups are routinely produced in a 90 durometer nitrile. This provides sufficient elasticity to permit stretching over the major diameter of a piston and then snapping back into the gland groove cut into the piston. 90 durometer has sufficient hardness to resist extrusion of the softer elastomeric O-ring performing the actual sealing function against the high pressure liquid or gas. * 000 Series O-rings 0.070\\" ¬±0.003\\" - .045\\" Thick * 100 Series O-rings 0.103\\" ¬±0.003\\" - .045\\" Thick * 200 Series O-rings 0.139\\" ¬±0.004\\" - .040\\" Thick * 300 Series O-rings 0.210\\" ¬±0.005\\" - .060\\" Thick * 400 Series O-rings 0.275\\" ¬±0.006\\" - .096\\" Thick  Pipe Connections  Back-up rings are used in Polyethylene (PE) pipe connections, such as HDPE pipes, where they are connected to steel pipe or pipe fittings.

The C.I had similarities with the earlier B.I (Type FD, also designed by Heinkel), including inward-sloping interplane bracing struts. Like other early-war Austro-Hungarian reconnaissance aircraft, such as C-types of Lloyd or Lohner, the Type LDD had a communal cockpit for its crew. The C.I served in the Imperial and Royal Aviation Troops in visual- and photographic reconnaissance, artillery observation and light bombing duties from early spring 1916 to the end of World War I. The aircraft had good handling characteristics, and steady introduction of more powerful engines in successive production batches (see below) enabled the improvement of performance and thus the continuing front- line service. Armament of the type consisted of a free-firing Schwarzlose machine gun at the rear for the observer, and at least in some aircraft for the pilot there was also a similar fixed, non-synchronised forward-firing gun in a pod above the top wing. This latter weapon was replaced in later production examples by a synchronised Schwarzlose gun on the port side of the fuselage.

Andrea Vanni (1332 ‚Äì c. 1414) was an Italian painter of the early Renaissance, active mainly in his native Siena. Biography Vanni was born in about 1332 in Siena. The first notice of him as a painter comes from 1353 when he was associated with Bartolo di Fredi, though it is uncertain if Vanni was a painter or assistant. His last activities date around 1400 and scholars have put his death to be around 1414 (although no documentary evidence). He was also involved in the foundation of the new government of Siena in 1368 and for twenty years held several different offices, including being elected to Great Council in 1370, Gonfaloniero in 1371, and sent on Envoys to the Pope in 1372 and again in 1384. Works Vanni is less known than his contemporaries. He appears influenced by his fellow Sienese Simone Martini and Pietro Lorenzetti. In Siena, only one work by his hand remains: an Enthroned Madonna in the transept of S. Francesco. Prior to 2002, there was also a painting of St. Paul in the Palazzo Pubblico but it was acquired by the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in the form of a gift from Mrs. W. Scott Fitz . Additional works to his credit are a portrait of St. Catherine of Siena (who was rumored to be a relative of his), located in the church of San Domenico to commemorate the life of the saint, and a fragmented Crucifixion which was originally housed in the church of Alborino and is now in the Istituto delle Belle Arti. Around 1400, Vanni painted another portrait of St. Catherine with scenes from the life of St. James in the chapel in San Jacomo Intercisco, but these works have disappeared. Polyptych of S. Stefano Vanni‚Äôs most famous work is a polyptych in the church of Santo Stefano alla Lizza. It gives the viewer a greater sense of Vanni‚Äôs manner. The central panel contains a portrait of the Virgin and Child and apart from the color being striking, there is a ‚Äúsilhouette-like character of the design‚Äù. The Madonna is set like a dark pattern against the gold background of her throne. There is almost no attempt at chiaroscuro except around the face and hands which gives the piece a rather flat effect, and is an example of Simone Martini‚Äôs influence. The drapery of the Virgin however, is an example of Lorenzetti‚Äôs influence. Simple folds and lines along with the Madonna‚Äôs stiff upright pose is nothing like the Madonna‚Äôs of Martini but the ‚Äústatelier figures of Lorenzetti‚Äù. The facial expression is completely of Vanni‚Äôs own. The Madonna has a large round head, narrow eyes and a delicate mouth. Her firm chin completes a set of strong features which are hard to ignore. The Christ Child is said to be modeled after the prototype for Martini‚Äôs fresco of the Majestas in the Palazzo della Signoria. The figures of SS. James and Stephen on the left side panels are clear examples of Vanni‚Äôs work. The head of S. Stephen is similar to that of the Virgin and show Vanni‚Äôs love for the silhouette. The side figures of saints in the pinnacles of the polyptych show a strong sense of modeling. Polyptych of San Stefano Works attributed to Vanni Another work may possibly be attributed to Vanni; a frescoed figure of St. John the Baptist on the left wall of a parish church in Basciano. There are only fragments of the fresco which survive and it is practically colorless which make it hard to prove authorship. The case for Vanni being the artist includes figure parallels to the S. Francesco fresco and the kneeling St. John on the right- hand panel of the Corcoran triptych. This work would be from Vanni‚Äôs late period and painted sometime after 1396 but prior to 1400. Some scholars suggest this fresco belongs to Andrea Gallerani.

He is mentioned in Pro Caelio, a famous speech in defense of Marcus Caelius Rufus by Marcus Tullius Cicero. Biography Probably born a member of the patrician branch of the ancient Sempronia family, Atratinus was possibly adopted by Lucius Calpurnius Bestia, but did not assume his adopted father‚Äôs nomen gentile.Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, Vol III, pg. 187 In 56 BC he launched a prosecution against Marcus Caelius Rufus who had previously unsuccessfully attempted to prosecute Atratinus‚Äôs adopted father on bribery charges. Caelius had fallen out with his lover, Clodia, and she accused him of attempted poisoning. Other charges included the murder of an ambassador. She asked Atratinus to prosecute Caelius, which he was only too happy to do.Holmes, pgs. 240-241 Caelius was successfully defended by Marcus Tullius Cicero, and in his published Pro Caelio, Cicero claimed that Atratinus was being manipulated by Clodia to get revenge on Caelius for an affair gone wrong.Holmes, pg. 241; Anthon & Smith, pg. 125 In 40 BC, Atratinus was elected praetor suffectus, as all the previously elected praetors had retired from office after the Treaty of Brundisium between Octavianus, Mark Antony and Lepidus. Late in 40 BC, he and his colleague Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus convened the Senate to introduce Herod the Great, who received the title of King of Judea.Broughton, pg. 379 This same year he was elected to the role of Augur, one of the priests of ancient Rome, a position he held until his death in 7 AD.Broughton, pg. 384 A supporter of Mark Antony, Atratinus was one of his legates, serving as propraetor in Greece in 39 BC.Broughton, pg. 388 In 36 BC he was given command of a portion of a fleet which Antony had sent to help Octavianus deal with Sextus Pompey.Broughton, pg. 401; Syme, pg. 231 In 34 BC he was elected suffect consul on January 1, as Antony resigned his position as consul within 24 hours. Atratinus himself held the consulate until July 1 of that year.Broughton, pg. 409 At some point prior to the Battle of Actium, Atratinus abandoned Antony and switched his support to Octavianus.Syme, pg. 282 He was made proconsular governor of Africa around 23 BC, and was awarded a triumph for his actions there in 21 BC.Syme, pgs. 328 & 339 Atratinus's sister, Sempronia, was married to Lucius Gellius Publicola.Syme, pg. 269 Atratinus' poorly preserved burial mausoleum is located in Gaeta, Italy.

The station was known for many years as \\"Kelston (for Saltford)\\", though Saltford had its own station on the Great Western Main Line. It was opened in 1869 when the Midland Railway's Bath branch was opened. It was served by stopping trains to Mangotsfield and the Midland Railway terminus at Bristol St Philips or Bristol Temple Meads, via Bitton and Oldland Common. The station generated little traffic apart from race days at Bath Racecourse, which could be reached by a three-mile trek over the fields, mostly uphill, or regatta days at Saltford. It closed at the end of 1948, though the line itself remained opened for passenger traffic until March 1966 and for goods to Bath gasworks until 1971. The station was destroyed by fire in 1882.

It is similar to the context-free grammar-parsing pushdown automaton, but instead of using a plain stack to store symbols, it has a stack of iterated stacks that store symbols, giving TAGs a generative capacity between context-free and context-sensitive grammars, or a subset of mildly context-sensitive grammars. Embedded pushdown automata should not be confused with nested stack automata which have more computational power. History and applications EPDAs were first described by K. Vijay-Shanker in his 1988 doctoral thesis. They have since been applied to more complete descriptions of classes of mildly context-sensitive grammars and have had important roles in refining the Chomsky hierarchy. Various subgrammars, such as the linear indexed grammar, can thus be defined. EPDAs are also beginning to play an important role in natural language processing. While natural languages have traditionally been analyzed using context-free grammars (see transformational-generative grammar and computational linguistics), this model does not work well for languages with crossed dependencies, such as Dutch, situations for which an EPDA is well suited. A detailed linguistic analysis is available in Joshi, Schabes (1997). Theory An EPDA is a finite state machine with a set of stacks that can be themselves accessed through the embedded stack. Each stack contains elements of the stack alphabet \\\\,\\\\Gamma, and so we define an element of a stack by \\\\,\\\\sigma_i \\\\in \\\\Gamma^*, where the star is the Kleene closure of the alphabet. Each stack can then be defined in terms of its elements, so we denote the \\\\,jth stack in the automaton using a double-dagger symbol: \\\\,\\\\Upsilon_j = \\\\ddagger\\\\sigma_j = \\\\\\\\{\\\\sigma_{j,k}, \\\\sigma_{j,k-1}, \\\\ldots, \\\\sigma_{j,1} \\\\\\\\}, where \\\\,\\\\sigma_{j, k} would be the next accessible symbol in the stack. The embedded stack of \\\\,m stacks can thus be denoted by \\\\,\\\\\\\\{\\\\Upsilon_j \\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{\\\\ddagger\\\\sigma_m,\\\\ddagger\\\\sigma_{m-1}, \\\\ldots, \\\\ddagger\\\\sigma_1 \\\\\\\\} \\\\in (\\\\ddagger\\\\Gamma^+)^*. We define an EPDA by the septuple (7-tuple) :\\\\,M = (Q, \\\\Sigma, \\\\Gamma, \\\\delta, q_0, Q_\\\\textrm{F}, \\\\sigma_0) where * \\\\,Q is a finite set of states; * \\\\,\\\\Sigma is the finite set of the input alphabet; * \\\\,\\\\Gamma is the finite stack alphabet; * \\\\,q_0 \\\\in Q is the start state; * \\\\,Q_\\\\textrm{F} \\\\subseteq Q is the set of final states; * \\\\,\\\\sigma_0 \\\\in \\\\Gamma is the initial stack symbol * \\\\,\\\\delta : Q \\\\times \\\\Sigma \\\\times \\\\Gamma \\\\rightarrow S is the transition function, where \\\\,S are finite subsets of \\\\,Q\\\\times (\\\\ddagger\\\\Gamma^+)^* \\\\times \\\\Gamma^* \\\\times (\\\\ddagger\\\\Gamma^+)^*. Thus the transition function takes a state, the next symbol of the input string, and the top symbol of the current stack and generates the next state, the stacks to be pushed and popped onto the embedded stack, the pushing and popping of the current stack, and the stacks to be considered the current stacks in the next transition. More conceptually, the embedded stack is pushed and popped, the current stack is optionally pushed back onto the embedded stack, and any other stacks one would like are pushed on top of that, with the last stack being the one read from in the next iteration. Therefore, stacks can be pushed both above and below the current stack. A given configuration is defined by :\\\\,C(M) = \\\\\\\\{q,\\\\Upsilon_m \\\\ldots \\\\Upsilon_1, x_1, x_2\\\\\\\\} \\\\in Q\\\\times (\\\\ddagger\\\\Gamma^+)^* \\\\times \\\\Sigma^* \\\\times \\\\Sigma^* where \\\\,q is the current state, the \\\\,\\\\Upsilons are the stacks in the embedded stack, with \\\\,\\\\Upsilon_m the current stack, and for an input string \\\\,x=x_1 x_2 \\\\in \\\\Sigma^*, \\\\,x_1 is the portion of the string already processed by the machine and \\\\,x_2 is the portion to be processed, with its head being the current symbol read. Note that the empty string \\\\,\\\\epsilon \\\\in \\\\Sigma is implicitly defined as a terminating symbol, where if the machine is at a final state when the empty string is read, the entire input string is accepted, and if not it is rejected. Such accepted strings are elements of the language :\\\\,L(M) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ x  \\\\\\\\{q_0,\\\\Upsilon_0,\\\\epsilon,x\\\\\\\\} \\\\rightarrow_M^* \\\\\\\\{q_\\\\textrm{F},\\\\Upsilon_m \\\\ldots \\\\Upsilon_1, x, \\\\epsilon\\\\\\\\} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} where \\\\,q_\\\\textrm{F} \\\\in Q_\\\\textrm{F} and \\\\,\\\\rightarrow_M^* defines the transition function applied over as many times as necessary to parse the string. An informal description of EPDA can also be found in Joshi, Schabes (1997), Sect.7, p. 23-25.  k-order EPDA and the Weir hierarchy  A more precisely defined hierarchy of languages that correspond to the mildly context-sensitive class was defined by David J. Weir. Based on the work of Nabil A. Khabbaz, Weir's Control Language Hierarchy is a containment where the Level-1 is defined as context-free, and Level-2 is the class of tree-adjoining and the other three grammars. Following are some of the properties of Level-k languages in the hierarchy: *Level-k languages are properly contained in the Level-(k + 1) language class *Level-k languages can be parsed in O(n^{3\\\\cdot2^{k-1}}) time *Level-k contains the language \\\\\\\\{a_1^n \\\\dotso a_{2^k}^nn\\\\geq0\\\\\\\\}, but not \\\\\\\\{a_1^n \\\\dotso a_{2^{k+1}}^nn\\\\geq0\\\\\\\\} *Level-k contains the language \\\\\\\\{w^{2^{k-1}}w\\\\in\\\\\\\\{a,b\\\\\\\\}^*\\\\\\\\}, but not \\\\\\\\{w^{2^{k-1}+1}w\\\\in\\\\\\\\{a,b\\\\\\\\}^*\\\\\\\\} Those properties correspond well (at least for small k > 1) to the conditions of mildly context-sensitive languages imposed by Joshi, and as k gets bigger, the language class becomes, in a sense, less mildly context-sensitive.

Career Felice (born 1955) grew up in Natick, Massachusetts, as a neighbor and friend of Jonathan Richman, a fellow fan of the Velvet Underground. At 15 he joined Richman in the first line-up of the Modern Lovers in the early 1970s. He performed with the band intermittently from then until 1973, but because of his school commitments, he was not involved in the 1972 sessions which produced the first Modern Lovers album, though Felice is featured on a few \\"Live\\" Modern Lovers releases playing lead guitar and backing vocals. Commenting on Richman, Felice has said, \\"Me and Jonathan, as close as we were, you know, I was like a punk, I was a wise-ass kid. I liked to do a lot of drugs, I liked to drink, and Jonathan was like this wide-eyed, no-drugs, ate nothing but health food...\\" Felice then decided to start his own band and formed the Real Kids (originally named the Kids) in 1972, with Rick Coraccio (bass), Steve Davidson (guitar), and Norman Bloom (drums).A \\"Live\\" recording from 1974 was later issued as a 10-inch EP. by Norton Records entitled \\"Foggy Notion\\", which consisted of three Velvet Underground songs and a cover of \\"Fly Into The Mystery\\", originally done by The Modern Lovers.Real Kids - lines-up They became a successful live band in the Boston area, playing \\"an aggressive brand of straight-ahead, no-bullshit rock which harkened back to Chuck Berry, had overtones of the British Invasion groups at their mod finest, yet pointed the way towards the Punk to come\\".Boston Rock Storybook - the Real Kids In addition to Felice's own songs, they performed versions of classics by Eddie Cochran, Buddy Holly and others. The band did not record until 1977, when it comprised Felice, Billy Borgioli (guitar), Allen \\"Alpo\\" Paulino (bass), and Howie Ferguson (drums). Their first studio album,The Real Kids, was issued on the Red Star label in 1977; it was later reissued by Norton Records who acquired the masters to the Red Star recordings and subsequently issued four more albums of early material. While continuing to play occasionally with different line-ups of the Real Kids, Felice also worked for a time as a roadie for the Ramones. He also performed as part of the Taxi Boys in Boston. In 1982, the Real Kids released a second EP, Outta Place. They also toured Europe and released a live album All Kindsa Jerks. They recorded a European release only new album, Hit You Hard, released on French label New Rose in 1983. Band members Allen \\"Alpo\\" Paulino and Billy Borgioli then left to form the Primitive Souls. In 1988, Felice formed a new band, John Felice and The Lowdowns, releasing an album Nothing Pretty on the Ace of Hearts label, later re-released on Norton Records. Miriam Linna, co-founder of the Norton label, worked at Red Star during the recording of the first album as their press agent, and went on to acquire the Red Star masters. The Real Kids reunited on several other occasions. They performed regularly in 1998‚Äì99, including a New York City new year's gig. Bass player Allen \\"Alpo\\" Paulino died on February 6, 2006. The Real Kids reformed in 2014 and released a new CD. Shake Outta Control, released on Ace of Hearts Records. This contained new recordings of some old classics like \\"Who Needs You\\" and \\"Common At Noon\\", along with a few new songs. The new album has received rave reviews worldwide.

Assigned to the South Atlantic blockade  Assigned to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, the new tug arrived off the bar outside Charleston, South Carolina, on 17 June 1864 and immediately took station in the outer cordon of Union warships striving to seal off that major port which, as the birthplace of secession, held great symbolic significance for the Confederacy in addition to its substantial strategic value. = Assisting in the capture of runner Pocahontas = The highlight of this duty‚Äîwhich she performed until March 1865‚Äîcame half an hour before midnight on 8 July 1864 when her boats joined those of the tug Sweet Brier in boarding and taking possession of the blockade-running \\". . . schooner Pocahontas, of and from Charleston, South Carolina, bound to Nassau, New Providence . . .\\"with a cargo of cotton and tobacco. From time to time during her ensuing months off Charleston, Azalea had brushes with blockade runners which were attempting to enter or leave port, but she did not score again before she retired to Port Royal, South Carolina, just before the arrival of spring.

General Robert E. Lee's army evacuated Richmond, Virginia, and Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his cabinet retired into the Deep South in the hope of continuing the struggle. However, Lee surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia on the 9th and General Joseph E. Johnston realized that his army, the only significant body of Confederate troops left in the field, could not prevail. On the 25th, Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman informed Rear Admiral John A. Dahlgren that he expected General Johnston to surrender the next day and asked the commander of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron to \\". . . watch the east coast and send word round to the west coast ...\\" lest Davis and his cabinet escape to Cuba. Azalea was one of the nine steamers that Dahlgren promptly sent to sea to intercept the former Southern chief of state.

The Center for Rural Affairs was formed by rural Nebraskans concerned about family farms and rural communities, and was originally located in Walthill, Nebraska. The Center moved to Lyons, Nebraska in 2003 where it continues to work on family farm and ranch issues and rural community development. The Center's strongest work has focused on rural micro-enterprise development in Nebraska, federal farm and rural policy, research and analysis of rural economic issues and trends, and, historically, its work with beginning farmers and ranchers.Center for Rural Affairs Brian Depew is the current Executive Director of the Center for Rural Affairs. The previous Executive Director was Chuck Hassebrook, who the Democratic gubernatorial candidate for Governor of Nebraska in the 2014 election and briefly a candidate for the United States Senate in the 2012 election. History In 1973, Don Ralston and Marty Strange were employed by the Goldenrod Hills Community Action Agency, a Nebraska non-profit corporation that was federally funded to eliminate poverty in five Northeast Nebraska counties. Don Ralston was Deputy Director and Marty Strange was a planner. As part of a planning process involving citizen participation, Goldenrod Hills launched an agricultural redevelopment program aimed at stimulating alternative crop production (onions were a prime example) and conceiving alternative food system approaches, including a small-scale home canning center in Winnebago. Advocacy efforts around agricultural issues were minimal. The initial staff included Laura Snake (later using her maiden name Whitewing), a Winnebago; Everett Kilzer, a long-time Walthill citizen with deep roots in the local economic system; and Lynn Spivak, who had been a VISTA volunteer with Goldenrod Hills. In January 1973, newly re-elected President Richard Nixon decided to eliminate the federal anti-poverty programs that were the central funding source for Goldenrod Hills, and he appointed Howard Phillips to shut down the federal agency that distributed the funding. Phillips issued a lengthy instruction detailing how to close out operations. The local reaction was strong. The Goldenrod Hills board was defiant with people like Art May, a community developer from Macy; Allen Heine, a prominent farmer/feeder from St. Helena; and Howard Swanson, a farm equipment dealer from Decatur. As the Golden Hills Community Action Agency was not a federal body, the government lack any real power to shut down the organization. The staff was commissioned to build a survival strategy. Don Ralston and Marty Strange were commissioned by Larry Lassek, the Goldenrod Hills executive director, to develop a plan by which the service programs of Goldenrod Hills and the advocacy and development efforts might both be preserved. May, Heine, and Swanson ultimately became those that incorporated the Center for Rural Affairs (CFRA), a separate entity from Golden Hills. With the primary goal of advocacy and development strategy, CFRA was designed to address controversial questions of economic policy affecting the agricultural base of Northeast Nebraska and to generate creative approaches to economic development. It was conceived and is largely funded privately.Center for Rural Affairs Lyons, Nebraska Lyons, Nebraska The Center for Rural Affairs moved to rural community of Lyons, Nebraska in 2003.

Although they never had a national chart hit, they were one of the most popular vocal groups in New York in the late 1950s. History The Solitaires formed in Harlem in 1953. They started as a street- corner singing group, one of many that used to congregate on 142nd Street. The original lineup consisted of Eddie \\"California\\" Jones (lead singer), Nick Anderson (first tenor), Winston \\"Buzzy\\" Willis (second tenor), Rudy \\"Angel\\" Morgan (baritone), and Pat Gaston (bass). =Old Town Records: 1954-1963= Herman Curtis After a series of personnel changes, the group had six members: Herman Curtis, also known as Herman Dunham (lead singer/first tenor), Buzzy Willis (second tenor), Pat Gaston (bass), Monteith \\"Monte\\" Owens (tenor/guitar), Bobby Baylor (second tenor/baritone) and Bobby \\"Schubie\\" Williams (tenor/piano). Curtis had previously performed with the Vocaleers, Gaston with the Four Bells, Willis with the Crows, and Owens, Baylor and Williams with the Mello-Moods. Willis happened to work for Hal Jackson, a famous disc jockey and radio personality at WLIB. With Jackson's help, the Solitaires landed an audition with record producer Hy Weiss in the fall of 1953. Weiss used to hold auditions in a local movie theater after it had closed for the night. Weiss was impressed with the young men's vocals. Just teenagers at the time, the Solitaires wrote most of their own material and had their own style of harmony, which helped distinguish them from the other street-corner singers. The group was signed to the Old Town record label, from which they issued a series of singles that included \\"Wonder Why\\", \\"Blue Valentine\\", and a cover version of the jazz standard, \\"I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance with You\\". It was during this period that the group's best known publicity photo was taken, showing Curtis, Gaston, Baylor, Williams and Willis in white jackets procured for them by their manager at the time, Maurice Hines (father of the noted actor and dancer Gregory Hines). Milton Love When Curtis left the group to join the air force in 1955, he was replaced by Milton Love (formerly of the Concords). It was with Love that the Solitaires enjoyed their greatest success. Love had taken voice lessons as a child, and had released a single with the Concords while still in high school, writing the lyrics and singing the lead on both sides. With the Concords he had also sung backup on a single with Pearl Reaves (\\"You Can't Stay Here\\"/\\"I'm Not Ashamed\\") which had done well locally. The Solitaires had a string of local hits throughout the latter part of the 1950s that included \\"The Wedding\\" (1955), \\"The Angels Sang\\" (1956), and their biggest hit, \\"Walking Along\\" (1957). Bass singer Freddy Barksdale joined the group in 1956 when Pat Gaston also joined the air force. Curtis rejoined the group when time permitted and sang lead on a few more songs, including \\"Please Kiss This Letter\\" and \\"Thrill of Love\\". Meanwhile the group performed regularly to sold-out crowds in venues along the East Coast and in Canada, including the Apollo Theater in Harlem, the Howard Theater in Washington, D.C., and shows hosted by Alan Freed, Hal Jackson, and Dr. Jive. In 1955 they performed at the Second Annual Festival of Negro Music at the Savoy Ballroom. Their songs received regular airplay and developed a loyal fan base among R&B; lovers. When they performed their hit song \\"The Wedding\\" and its sequel, \\"The Honeymoon\\", Love would wear a mop on his head to play the part of the bride. In 1959 the Solitaires were booked to play at the Paramount along with Frankie Avalon, Buddy Holly, and the Big Bopper. They never got to meet Holly or the Big Bopper, as both were killed in a plane crash that February. =Other labels= The group disbanded temporarily in 1961 when Milton Love joined the army for two years. Although they were popular in New York and several of their singles had been regional hits, they had not had a national chart hit. This was likely due to poor distribution by Old Town. Their signature song, \\"Walking Along\\", was a local chart hit in the New York area in 1957. When a white group, the Diamonds, covered it in 1958, it reached #29 on the Billboard Hot 100. The Solitaires then made some additional sales by re-releasing their version with Argo Records. A last Old Town single, recorded a few years earlier, was released in 1963. The group released three more singles under other labels in 1964. Calling themselves the Cadillacs, the group backed up Ray Brewster in \\"Fool\\", released by Arctic. They recorded another single as the Chances, \\"Through a Long and Sleepless Night\\", released by Roulette. Their last single as the Solitaires was \\"Fool That I Am\\", released by MGM. =Later years= Various Solitaires lineups have toured since 1961. For several years the group was made up of Milton Love, Freddy Barksdale, George Magnezid and Robbie Mansfield. (Both Magnezid and Mansfield formerly sang with the Wrens.) The group performed at United in Group Harmony Association concerts and other venues in the 1990s. In 2012 their lineup consisted of Milton Love, Alvin Grant, Don Cruz, and Ray Goodwin. As recently as Labor Day 2014 the group was performing in the New Jersey area. The current and former members have pursued a variety of careers in and out of the music industry. Milton Love became a medical technician. Notably, Pat Gaston, formerly a high school dropout, eventually earned a doctorate in clinical psychology. Bobby Williams died in 1961. Monte Owens died on March 3, 2011 in the Bronx, New York, after illness, at the age of 74. In 1984, the Murray Hill Company released a boxed set of Solitaires recordings which included several previously unreleased songs. Due to a mixup at Old Town, it also included a song not performed by the Solitaires: \\"Darling, Listen to the Words of This Song\\" was actually performed by another Old Town group called the Supremes (not to be confused with the Motown Supremes). Another unreleased song, \\"Silent Grief\\", written and sung by Milton Love, was unearthed by a collector and released in the 1990s. Influence Although none of their original records made the charts, several of their songs have gained recognition over the years and have been included in anthologies such as 25 All-Time Doo-Wop Hits, The Best of Doo-Wop, Doo-Wop Classics, Doo-Wop Treasures, Only the Best of Old Town Records, and Rhino's Doo-Wop Box. (Richie Unterberger classed the Solitaires' \\"I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You\\" with the \\"should-have-been-hits\\" in his review of Doo-Wop Box.) The group's recording career is described as \\"illustrious\\" in Mitch Rosalsky's Encyclopedia of Rhythm & Blues and Doo-Wop Vocal Groups. Decades after its original release, rock musician Lou Reed mentioned \\"Later for You, Baby\\" by the Solitaires in an interview, along with songs by the Mellows and other New York doo-wop groups, noting that they had been far more influential than anyone seemed to realize.

The application used maps of the United States to help users explore data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) and Superfund programs with visual projections and maps. Description TOXMAP helped users create nationwide, regional, or local area maps showing where TRI chemicals are released on-site into the air, water, ground, and by underground injection, as reported by industrial facilities in the United States. It also identified the releasing facilities, color-codes release amounts for a single year or year range, and provides multi-year aggregate chemical release data and trends over time, starting with 1988. Maps also can show locations of Superfund sites on the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry National Priorities List (NPL), which lists all chemical contaminants present at these sites. There were two versions of TOXMAP available from its home page: the classic version of TOXMAP released in 2004 and, a newer version released in 2014 that is based on Adobe Flash/Apache Flex technology. In addition to many of the features of TOXMAP classic, the new version provides an improved map appearance and interactive capabilities as well as a more current GIS look-and-feel. This included seamless panning, immediate update of search results when zooming to a location, two collapsible side panels to maximize map size, and automatic size adjustment after a window resize. The new TOXMAP also improved U.S. Census layers and availability by Census Tract (2000 and 2010), Canadian National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) data, U.S. commercial nuclear power plants, as well as improved and updated congressional district boundaries. TOXMAP classic users may search the system by location (such as city, state, or ZIP code), chemical name, chemical name fragment, release medium, release amount, facility name and ID, and can filter results to those residing within a pre-defined or custom geographic region. Search results may be brought up in Google Maps or Google Earth, or saved for use in other tools. TOXMAP also overlays map data such as U.S. Census population information, income figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and health data from the National Cancer Institute and the National Center for Health Statistics. The data shown in TOXMAP comes from the following sources: * EPA Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) * EPA Superfund Program (National Priorities List/NPL) * Environment Canada * National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Superfund Research Program * Hazardous Substances Data Bank * NLM TOXLINE (Toxicology Bibliographic Information) * Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry * National Atlas of the United States * Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database * National Center for Health Statistics * Nuclear Regulatory Commission * Esri Shutdown The database was pulled from the internet by the Trump administration in December 2019. The NLM said in a statement that much of the information remained available from the original sources, and that thus the database could be removed; critics, such as the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative, suggested it was part of a larger effort on the part of the administration to obfuscate the detrimental results of the rollback of Obama-era environmental regulations.

The double-stranded genome is used to transcribe a positive-strand RNA by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The positive-strand RNA may be used as messenger RNA (mRNA) which can be translated into viral proteins by the host cell's ribosomes. The positive-strand RNA can also be replicated by the RdRp to create a new double-stranded viral genome. Double-stranded RNA viruses are classified in two separate phyla Duplornaviricota and Pisuviricota (specifically class Duplopiviricetes), which are in the kingdom Orthornavirae and realm Riboviria. The two groups do not share a common dsRNA virus ancestor. Double-stranded RNA viruses evolved two separate times from positive-strand RNA viruses. In the Baltimore classification system, dsRNA viruses belong to Group III. Virus group members vary widely in host range (animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria), genome segment number (one to twelve), and virion organization (T-number, capsid layers, or turrets). Double-stranded RNA viruses include the rotaviruses, known globally as a common cause of gastroenteritis in young children, and bluetongue virus, an economically significant pathogen of cattle and sheep. The family Reoviridae is the largest and most diverse dsRNA virus family in terms of host range. Classification Two clades of dsRNA viruses exist: the phylum Duplornaviricota and the class Duplopiviricetes, which is in the phylum Pisuviricota. Both are included in the kingdom Orthornavirae in the realm Riboviria. Based on phylogenetic analysis of RdRp, the two clades do not share a common dsRNA ancestor but are instead separately descended from different positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. In the Baltimore classification system, which groups viruses together based on their manner of mRNA synthesis, dsRNA viruses are group III. =Duplornaviricota= Duplornaviricota contains most dsRNA viruses, including reoviruses, which infect a diverse range of eukaryotes, and cystoviruses, which are the only dsRNA viruses known to infect prokaryotes. Apart from RdRp, viruses in Duplornaviricota also share icosahedral capsids that contain 60 homo- or heterodimers of the capsid protein organized on a pseudo T=2 lattice. The phylum is divided into three classes: Chrymotiviricetes, which primarily contains fungal and protozoan viruses, Resentoviricetes, which contains reoviruses, and Vidaverviricetes, which contains cystoviruses. =Duplopiviricetes= The class Duplopiviricetes is the second clade of dsRNA viruses and is in the phylum Pisuviricota, which also contains positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. Duplopiviricetes mostly contains plant and fungal viruses and includes the following four families: Amalgaviridae, Hypoviridae, Partitiviridae, and Picobirnaviridae. Notes on selected species =Reoviridae= Reoviridae are currently classified into nine genera. The genomes of these viruses consist of 10 to 12 segments of dsRNA, each generally encoding one protein. The mature virions are non-enveloped. Their capsids, formed by multiple proteins, have icosahedral symmetry and are arranged generally in concentric layers. A distinguishing feature of the dsRNA viruses, irrespective of their family association, is their ability to carry out transcription of the dsRNA segments, under appropriate conditions, within the capsid. In all these viruses, the enzymes required for endogenous transcription are thus part of the virion structure. Orthoreoviruses The orthoreoviruses (reoviruses) are the prototypic members of the virus Reoviridae family and representative of the turreted members, which comprise about half the genera. Like other members of the family, the reoviruses are non-enveloped and characterized by concentric capsid shells that encapsidate a segmented dsRNA genome. In particular, reovirus has eight structural proteins and ten segments of dsRNA. A series of uncoating steps and conformational changes accompany cell entry and replication. High-resolution structures are known for almost all of the proteins of mammalian reovirus (MRV), which is the best-studied genotype. Electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM) and X-ray crystallography have provided a wealth of structural information about two specific MRV strains, type 1 Lang (T1L) and type 3 Dearing (T3D). Cypovirus The cytoplasmic polyhedrosis viruses (CPVs) form the genus Cypovirus of the family Reoviridae. CPVs are classified into 14 species based on the electrophoretic migration profiles of their genome segments. Cypovirus has only a single capsid shell, which is similar to the orthoreovirus inner core. CPV exhibits striking capsid stability and is fully capable of endogenous RNA transcription and processing. The overall folds of CPV proteins are similar to those of other reoviruses. However, CPV proteins have insertional domains and unique structures that contribute to their extensive intermolecular interactions. The CPV turret protein contains two methylase domains with a highly conserved helix-pair/Œ≤-sheet/helix-pair sandwich fold but lacks the Œ≤-barrel flap present in orthoreovirus Œª2\\\\. The stacking of turret protein functional domains and the presence of constrictions and A spikes along the mRNA release pathway indicate a mechanism that uses pores and channels to regulate the highly coordinated steps of RNA transcription, processing, and release. Rotavirus Rotavirus is the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis in infants and young children worldwide. This virus contains a dsRNA genome and is a member of the Reoviridae family. The genome of rotavirus consists of eleven segments of dsRNA. Each genome segment codes for one protein with the exception of segment 11, which codes for two proteins. Among the twelve proteins, six are structural and six are non- structural proteins. It is a double-stranded RNA non-enveloped virus Bluetongue virus The members of genus Orbivirus within the Reoviridae family are arthropod borne viruses and are responsible for high morbidity and mortality in ruminants. Bluetongue virus (BTV) which causes disease in livestock (sheep, goat, cattle) has been in the forefront of molecular studies for the last three decades and now represents the best understood orbivirus at the molecular and structural levels. BTV, like other members of the family, is a complex non-enveloped virus with seven structural proteins and a RNA genome consisting of 10 variously sized dsRNA segments. Phytoreoviruses Phytoreoviruses are non-turreted reoviruses that are major agricultural pathogens, particularly in Asia. One member of this family, Rice Dwarf Virus (RDV), has been extensively studied by electron cryomicroscopy and x-ray crystallography. From these analyses, atomic models of the capsid proteins and a plausible model for capsid assembly have been derived. While the structural proteins of RDV share no sequence similarity to other proteins, their folds and the overall capsid structure are similar to those of other Reoviridae. = Saccharomyces cerevisiae virus L-A = The L-A dsRNA virus of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a single 4.6 kb genomic segment that encodes its major coat protein, Gag (76 kDa) and a Gag-Pol fusion protein (180 kDa) formed by a -1 ribosomal frameshift. L-A can support the replication and encapsidation in separate viral particles of any of several satellite dsRNAs, called M dsRNAs, each of which encodes a secreted protein toxin (the killer toxin) and immunity to that toxin. L-A and M are transmitted from cell to cell by the cytoplasmic mixing that occurs in the process of mating. Neither is naturally released from the cell or enters cells by other mechanisms, but the high frequency of yeast mating in nature results in the wide distribution of these viruses in natural isolates. Moreover, the structural and functional similarities with dsRNA viruses of mammals has made it useful to consider these entities as viruses. =Infectious bursal disease virus= Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is the best-characterized member of the family Birnaviridae. These viruses have bipartite dsRNA genomes enclosed in single layered icosahedral capsids with T = 13l geometry. IBDV shares functional strategies and structural features with many other icosahedral dsRNA viruses, except that it lacks the T = 1 (or pseudo T = 2) core common to the Reoviridae, Cystoviridae, and Totiviridae. The IBDV capsid protein exhibits structural domains that show homology to those of the capsid proteins of some positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, such as the nodaviruses and tetraviruses, as well as the T = 13 capsid shell protein of the Reoviridae. The T = 13 shell of the IBDV capsid is formed by trimers of VP2, a protein generated by removal of the C-terminal domain from its precursor, pVP2. The trimming of pVP2 is performed on immature particles as part of the maturation process. The other major structural protein, VP3, is a multifunctional component lying under the T = 13 shell that influences the inherent structural polymorphism of pVP2. The virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, VP1, is incorporated into the capsid through its association with VP3. VP3 also interacts extensively with the viral dsRNA genome. =Bacteriophage Œ¶6= Bacteriophage Œ¶6, is a member of the Cystoviridae family. It infects Pseudomonas bacteria (typically plant-pathogenic P. syringae). It has a three- part, segmented, double-stranded RNA genome, totalling ~13.5 kb in length. Œ¶6 and its relatives have a lipid membrane around their nucleocapsid, a rare trait among bacteriophages. It is a lytic phage, though under certain circumstances has been observed to display a delay in lysis which may be described as a \\"carrier state\\". Anti-virals Since cells do not produce double-stranded RNA during normal nucleic acid metabolism, natural selection has favored the evolution of enzymes that destroy dsRNA on contact. The best known class of this type of enzymes is Dicer. It is hoped that broad-spectrum anti-virals could be synthesized that take advantage of this vulnerability of double-stranded RNA viruses.

Most likely evolved from Clitendoceras, a narrow, slightly endogastric genus intermediate in form between straight shelled Proendoceras and the bulkier Piloceratidae. Found in shallow carbonate marine sediments of Demingian through the Cassinian age, (essentially Arenigian, = early Middle -Upper Canadian) . Pilocerids split off from the Proterocameroceratidae very shortly after their inception and are the first family which the proterocamerocerids gave rise to. With the exception of Humeoceras, found in the middle Silurian, pilocerid genera are limited to the Lower Ordovician (Canadian in North America). The general shape of the pilocerid shell precludes an ambush predator lying in wait on the sea floor, or a stealthful hunter drifting through the water. Rather, they probably crawled over the sea floor, head down with the shell off the bottom, searching for prey. Nothing is known of their soft part anatomy, other than what can be surmised from the fact they are cephalopods. They likely possessed tentacles of some sort, but were they numerous like those of modern Nautilus, limited to eight or ten as with octopus or squid, or of some other arrangement. Pilocerid genera include the strongly curved Piloceras, Bisonoceras with its hooked bison horn shape, nearly straight Allopiloceras, Dartonoceras, and internally complex Cassinoceras. Ecologically the Piloceratidae were replaced in the Middle Ordovician by the Cyrtendoceradae,which may have evolved early from the Endoceratidae rather than being direct pilocerid descendants.
