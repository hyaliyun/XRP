Levake is used here throughout, as it is the variant all sources mention in common. was born around 1793 in Bolton, Vermont, the son of Augustus Levesque (or Levake) and Lucy Clark., cited in . His father was born in Quebec but had joined the Continental Army at the beginning of the American Revolutionary War when Moses Hazen was recruiting Canadian residents, and as a result had been both excommunicated by the Catholic Church and labeled a traitor by the British, under threat of execution if he returned to Canada. Since he was unable to return home, he had settled in Bolton after the war and opened a hotel., cited in . Henry Levake served in the War of 1812 and then, having secured a fur trading license, moved to Michigan. Exact dates of his movements are not known, but in 1820 he was engaged in business in Michilimackinac County. In the fall of 1822 he acquired a license from the U.S. Indian agent for the area, Henry Schoolcraft, to trade with the Native Americans in the area. He also served as an interpreter for Schoolcraft and his agency, and records indicate that in this capacity he helped supply Native Americans with whiskey, in contravention of the trading rules. He operated a trading post on Grand Island, Michigan, for several years, though probably not past 1828, and had accounts with the American Fur Company store in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and a sutler at Fort Brady named John Hulbert. By 1827 he had established a permanent residence in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. He served in a variety of official posts in Michilimackinac County in the 1820s, and served as a witness to treaties the United States signed in 1826 and 1836 with the Chippewa and Ottawa nations. He served for the first four terms of the Michigan House of Representatives. Levake died around 1839 in Sault Ste. Marie. = Family = Scholars believe Levake had a relationship of some kind with a Native American woman, which was a common practice among traders trying to improve their business connections. The treaty of 1826 included provisions for land to be given to \\"half-breeds\\" and the Native American families of various traders, including one section to a Fanny Levake and all of her children; Fanny's mother is listed as Meeshwanqua. The 1836 treaty granted two sections to the Native American families of various people including Levake. In 1837, Levake married Martha Davenport, leading scholars to believe he had ended his previous relationship.

The two teams stand ready, each side has 24 knights, all with heraldic surcoats and caparisons, and each accompanied by a banner-bearer with a heraldic flag. There is a central spectators' box for the four judges, where the heraldic shields of the competitors are displayed, the two teams being led by the dukes of Brittany and Bourbon, respectively, and one spectator box on each side for the ladies; inscribed over the boxes is plus est en vous, the heraldic motto of the Gruuthuse family of Bruges, attributed to tournament between Jean III de Gruuthuse and Jean de Ghistelles held in 1393.Octave Delepierre, Pr√©cis des annales de Bruges (1835) 38f. Ren√© of Anjou's contemporary Louis de Gruuthuse himself was a famous competitor in tournaments during the 1440s. The two dukes can be seen facing each other in the center of the front lines, each with a personal heraldic flag as well with a larger flag of the same design representing their team. The chief herald is also on horseback, between the two teams, wearing his own heraldic colours. Heraldry is the system of visual identification of rank and pedigree which developed in the European High Middle Ages,Fox-Davies, A Complete Guide to Heraldry, pp. 1‚Äì18. closely associated with the courtly culture of chivalry, Latin Christianity, the Crusades, feudal aristocracy, and monarchy of the time. Heraldic tradition fully developed in the 13th century, and it flourished and developed further during the Late Middle Ages and the Early Modern period. Originally limited to nobility, heraldry is adopted by wealthy commoners in the Late Middle Ages (Burgher arms). Specific traditions of Ecclesiastical heraldry also develop in the late medieval period. Coats of arms of noble families, often after their extinction, becomes attached to the territories they used to own, giving rise to municipal coats of arms by the 16th century. Western heraldry spread beyond its core territory of Latin Christendom in the 17th century, Western heraldic traditions being adopted in the Russian Empire. With the decline of European monarchies in favour of Republicanism in the 19th to 20th centuries, heraldic tradition declined in importance, but modern national flags and national emblems adopted in the 19th and 20th century still frequently use elements inherited from heraldic tradition. Precursors Depiction of Carolingian-era round shields (Stuttgart Psalter, 9th century). The spiral patterns represent iron bracing reinforcing the shield. Proto- heraldic shield decorations shown in the Bayeux Tapestry (c. 1077). Traditions of field signs, personal emblems or seals go back to at least the Bronze Age. The ekphrastic description of shield designs in particular is found as a topos in classical literature.Fox-Davies, A Complete Guide to Heraldry, pp. 6‚Äì10. Units of the Roman army were sometimes identified by distinctive markings on their shields.Notitia Dignitatum, Bodleian Library Heraldry developed in the high medieval period, based on earlier, \\"pre-heraldic\\" or \\"ante-heraldic\\", traditions of visual identification by means of seals, field signs, emblems used on coins, etc. Notably, lions that would subsequently appear in 12th- century coats of arms of European nobility have pre-figurations in the animal style of ancient art (specifically the style of Scythian art as it developed from c. the 7th century BC).\\"significant pre-figuration of medieval heraldry\\" John Onians, Atlas of World Art (2004), p. 58. Western heraldry is an innovation of the 12th century. Certain members of the high nobility began to display animals, specifically lions on their shields beginning in c. the 1140s. Prior to this, western military shields of the 11th to early 12th century did sometimes show simple decorations, but not apparently tied to the personal identification of the bearer. The Bayeux Tapestry, illustrating the Norman invasion of England in 1066, and probably commissioned about 1077, when the cathedral of Bayeux was rebuilt, depicts a number of shields of various shapes and designs, many of which are plain, while others are decorated with dragons, crosses, or other typically heraldic figures. Yet no individual is depicted twice bearing the same arms, nor are any of the descendants of the various persons depicted known to have borne devices resembling those in the tapestry.John Woodward and George Burnett, A Treatise on Heraldry: British and Foreign, W. & A. K. Johnson, Edinburgh and London (1892), vol. 1, pp. 29‚Äì31.Fox-Davies, A Complete Guide to Heraldry, pp. 14‚Äì16. Frankish or German round shields of the 11th century (Ottonian, Salian) are sometimes depicted with simple geometric ornamentation, but not with figurative emblems.Round Shield Designs (vikingage.org): \\"chequered\\" (11th c., Biblio. Mun. Avranches MS50), \\"flared cross\\" (c.1000-1050 Arras, BM MS 559 (435), vol. 1), \\"spirals\\" (c.1000-1050 Arras, BM MS 559 (435), vol. 1), \\"spirals with dots\\" (c.1000-1020 Bamberg MS A. II. 42 Bamberg Apocalypse). Similarly, an account of the French knights at the court of the Byzantine emperor Alexius I at the beginning of the twelfth century describes their shields of polished metal, utterly devoid of heraldic design. A Spanish manuscript from 1109 describes both plain and decorated shields, none of which appears to have been heraldic.Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 26. The Abbey of St. Denis contained a window commemorating the knights who embarked on the Second Crusade in 1147, and was probably made soon after the event; but Montfaucon's illustration of the window before it was destroyed shows no heraldic design on any of the shields.Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 31. Proto-heraldry (12th century) Drawing of the equestrian seal of Theobald III, Count of Blois, dated 1138. Traces of an ornamental cross design are visible on the shield. The 12th- century tradition is mostly preserved in the form of the equestrian seals popular at the time which show the nobleman as a fully armed warrior on horseback. Early equestrian seals show plain shields. From the mid 12th century, proto-heraldic designs are sometimes shown, but the shield is shown naturally, as part of the knight's armament, and is often seen in profile or partially obscured. The equestrian seal of Enguerrand (Ingelram), count of Saint-Pol (1130s or 1140s) still shows a plain shield, but what would later become heraldic charges (in this case, sheaves of corn) are shown arranged around the horse.\\"le blason fait son apparition dans les derni√®res ann√©es du XIIe si√®cle, brusquement, sans transition. Mais il est d‚Äôautres types plus anciens o√π les pi√®ces des armoiries existent, s‚Äôannon√ßant pour ainsi dire avant de passer dans l‚Äô√©cu. Le sceau d‚ÄôEnguerran, comte de Saint-Pol, ant√©rieur √† l‚Äôann√©e 1150, est de ce nombre. Il offre d√©j√† plusieurs gerbes dispers√©es dans le champ.\\" G. Demay, Le Blason d‚Äôapr√®s les sceaux du Moyen-√Çge (1877), p. 6. Seals displaying actual heraldic shields appear by the very end of the 12th century or the early years of the 13th century. Seals with elements of a distinctly heraldic character begin to appear in the second third of the 12th century. A number of seals dating from between 1135 and 1155 appear to show the adoption of heraldic devices in England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy.Thomas Woodcock & John Martin Robinson, The Oxford Guide to Heraldry, Oxford University Press, New York (1988), p. 1. A notable example of an early armorial seal is attached to a charter granted by Philip I, Count of Flanders, in 1164. Seals from the latter part of the eleventh and early twelfth centuries show no evidence of heraldic symbolism, but by the end of the twelfth century, seals are uniformly heraldic in nature.Wagner, Heraldry in England, p. 8. Among the oldest equestrial seals with armorials are those of Henry the Lion of the House of Welf, duke of Saxony (1142-1180) and Bavaria (1156-1180). A total of seven seals of Henry's are known. Of these, only the second shows a recognizable lion displayed on his shield. This seal is attached to two documents dated to 1146. It is possible that the lion was also on the first seal (c. 1142), but it is no longer recognizable.Xenja von Ertzdorff, Rudolf Schulz, Winfried Baumann, Die Romane von dem Ritter mit dem L√∂wen (1994), p. 175, citing Schmidt-Phiseldeck, Die Siegel des herzoglichen Hauses Braunschweig und L√ºneburg, nr. 1-4. An equestrian seal of similar antiquity is that of Ottokar III of Styria, dated 1160, with an early form of the Styrian panther on his shield. Enamel from the tomb of Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, showing his shield in profile, with four out of what were presumably six lions visible (six lions are on the shield of the effigy of his grandson William Longesp√©e, d. 1226). The oldest extant depiction of a coloured armoury can be seen on the tomb of Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, who died in 1151.Fox-Davies, A Complete Guide to Heraldry, p. 62. An enamel, probably commissioned by Geoffrey's widow between 1155 and 1160, depicts him carrying a blue shield decorated with six golden lions rampant. He wears a blue helmet adorned with another lion, and his cloak is lined in vair. A medieval chronicle states that Geoffrey was given a shield of this description when he was knighted by his father-in-law, Henry I, in 1128; but this account probably dates to about 1175.C. A. Stothard, Monumental Effigies of Great Britain (1817) pl. 2, illus. in Anthony Wagner, Richmond Herald, Heraldry in England, Penguin (1946), pl. I. The earliest evidence of the association of lions with the English crown is a seal bearing two lions passant, used by the future King John during the lifetime of his father, Henry II, who died in 1189.Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 32.Fox-Davies, A Complete Guide to Heraldry, pp. 173‚Äì174. Since Henry was the son of Geoffrey Plantagenet, it seems reasonable to suppose that the adoption of lions as an heraldic emblem by Henry or his sons might have been inspired by Geoffrey's shield. John's elder brother, Richard the Lionheart, who succeeded his father on the throne, is believed to have been the first to have borne the arms of three lions passant-guardant, still the arms of England, having earlier used two lions rampant combatant, which arms may also have belonged to his father.Pastoureau, p. 59. Richard is also credited with having originated the English crest of a lion statant (now statant-guardant).Woodward and Burnett, p. 37. Early mention of heraldic shields in Middle High German literature also dates to the 12th century. Shield designs are described in the Kaiserchronik (c. 1150-1170), such as the boar carried by the Romans, as well as, in isolated cases, in the Rolandslied (c. 1115), K√∂nig Rother (c. 1150), Veldecke's Eneas (c. 1170), and Hartmann's Erec (c. 1185). These appear in the larger context of describing an armed protagonist, and are not yet tied to the bearer's pedigree.\\"With the exception of several heraldic shields that appear in the Kaiserchronik, such as the boar carried by the Romans--the oldest heraldic insignia in medieval German epic literature, according to Zips [Wappenwesen, 1966]--most of the precourtly and even courtly epics up to 1200 contain very few decorated shields at all. Several isolated coats of arms are mentioned in the German Rolandslied, K√∂nig Rother, Veldecke's Eneas, and Hartmann's Erec--mostly related to the protagonists.\\" Wandhoff (2016), (p. 57). Frederick Barbarossa as a Crusader (c. 1188). The cross symbol worn on the shield and surcoat at this time is not a heraldic charge identifying the bearer but a field sign worn by all participants in the Crusade. At least two distinctive features of heraldry are generally accepted as products of the Crusades: the surcoat, an outer garment worn over the armor to protect the wearer from the heat of the sun, was often decorated with the same devices that appeared on a knight's shield. It is from this garment that the phrase \\"coat of arms\\" is derived.Fox-Davies, A Complete Guide to Heraldry, pp. 17‚Äì18. Also the lambrequin, or mantling, that depends from the helmet and frames the shield in modern heraldry, began as a practical covering for the helmet and the back of the neck during the Crusades, serving much the same function as the surcoat. Its slashed or scalloped edge, today rendered as billowing flourishes, is thought to have originated from hard wearing in the field, or as a means of deadening a sword blow and perhaps entangling the attacker's weapon.Fox-Davies, A Complete Guide to Heraldry, pp. 17‚Äì18, 383. Medieval heraldry rolls of arms, showing the coats of arms as yet without helmets or any other achievements. Part of the Z√ºrich armorial (c. 1340), an early example of the tradition of representing coats of arms with a representation of helmet and crest. =Terminology= The origin of the term heraldry itself (Middle English heraldy, Old French hiraudie), can be placed in the context of the early forms of the knightly tournaments in the 12th century. Combatants wore full armour, and identified themselves by wearing their emblems on their shields. A herald (Old French heraut, from a Frankish *hariwald \\"commander of an army\\") was an officer who would announce the competitors. Originally a type of messenger employed by noblemen, heralds assumed the responsibility of learning and knowing the rank, pedigree, and heraldic devices of various knights and lords, as well as the rules and protocols governing the design and description, or blazoning of arms, and the precedence of their bearers.Fox- Davies, A Complete Guide to Heraldry, pp. 27‚Äì29. As early as the late thirteenth century, certain heralds in the employ of monarchs were given the title \\"King of Heralds\\", which eventually became \\"King of Arms.\\" The term coat of arms in origin refers to the surcoat with heraldic designs worn by combatants, especially in the knightly tournament, in Old French cote a armer. The sense is transferred to the heraldic design itself in Middle English, in the mid-14th century.etymonline.com =Heraldic shield= By about the 1230s, the shields used by cavalry were almost triangular in shape, referred to as heater shields. Such a shield is preserved, the shield of Konrad von Th√ºringen, dated c. 1230, showing the lion barry of the Ludovingians. This heater-shaped form was used in warfare during the apogee of the Age of Chivalry, and it becomes the classic heraldic shield, or escutcheon, at about the time of the Battle of Crecy (1346) and the founding of the Order of the Garter (1348), when heraldry had become a fully developed system. All medieval rolls of arms, from the late 13th and throughout the 14th to 15th century, almost exclusively use this shield shape.

File:Konrad von Gr√ºnenberg - Beschreibung der Reise von Konstanz nach Jerusalem - Blatt 50v - 106.jpgExample of burgher arms at the end of the medieval period, Conrad Gr√ºnenberg (1487) shows his arms of two green trimounts along with the emblems of the \\"orders\\" for which he acquired a claim to membership on his pilgrimage to Jerusalem, the Jerusalem cross for the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, the sword and scroll of the Order of the Sword, the vase with flowers emblem of the Order of the Jar and the half-wheel of Saint Catherine. =Division of the field= Coats of arms of the 13th century in some cases already include marks of cadency to distinguish descendants, but they mostly still do without division of the field to indicate descent from more than one lineage. An exception is the coat of arms of Castile and Le√≥n, showing the arms of Castile (the yellow castle) quartered with the arms of Le√≥n (the purple lion) in the late 13th century Camden Roll and Segar's Roll. This practice becomes much more common in the late medieval period. For example, the arms of Eric of Pomerania as king of the Kalmar Union (r. 1396‚Äì1439) combine five coats of arms, for Denmark, Sweden, the House of Bjelbo, Pomerania and Norway, quartered by a cross gules and with a central inescutcheon. In the later 15th century, holders of ecclesiastical office would quarter their family arms with those of the order or diocese they represented. Thus Pierre d'Aubusson as grand master of the Knights of Malta quartered his family arms with the Maltese cross; bishop Hugo von Hohenlandenberg quartered his family arms with those of the prince-bishopric of Constance. =Heraldic authorities= By the middle of the fourteenth century, the principle that only a single individual was entitled to bear a particular coat of arms was generally accepted, and disputes over the ownership of arms seems to have led to gradual establishment of heraldic authorities to regulate their use. The earliest known work of heraldic jurisprudence, De Insigniis et Armis, was written about 1350 by Bartolus de Saxoferrato, a professor of law at the University of Padua.De Insigniis et ArmisGeorge Squibb, \\"The Law of Arms in England\\", in The Coat of Arms vol. II, no. 15 (Spring 1953), p. 244. The most celebrated armorial dispute in English heraldry is that of Scrope v Grosvenor (1390), in which two different men claimed the right to bear azure, a bend or.Fox-Davies, A Complete Guide to Heraldry, pp. 21‚Äì22. The continued proliferation of arms, and the number of disputes arising from different men assuming the same arms, led Henry V to issue a proclamation in 1419, forbidding all those who had not borne arms at the Battle of Agincourt from assuming arms, except by inheritance or a grant from the crown.Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, pp. 35‚Äì36. Early modern heraldry The \\"Quaternion eagle\\", representing the estates of the Holy Roman Empire (1510). Arms of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor in the choir of the Cathedral of Cordoba, 16th century. Royal coats of arms in Siebmachers Wappenbuch (1605) In 1484, during the reign of Richard III, the various heralds employed by the crown were incorporated into the College of Arms, through which all new grants of arms would eventually be issued.Fox- Davies, A Complete Guide to Heraldry, p. 38.Pastoureau, pp. 39‚Äì41. The college currently consists of three Kings of Arms, assisted by six Heralds, and four Pursuivants, or junior officers of arms, all under the authority of the Earl Marshal; but all of the arms granted by the college are gra√Önted by the authority of the crown.College of Arms official website, accessed 3 March 2016. Similar bodies regulate the granting of arms in other monarchies and several members of the Commonwealth of Nations, but in most other countries there is no heraldic authority, and no law preventing anyone from assuming whatever arms they please, provided that they do not infringe upon the arms of another. Beginning in the reign of Henry VIII, the Kings of Arms were commanded to make visitations, in which they traveled about the country, recording arms borne under proper authority, and requiring those who bore arms without authority either to obtain authority for them, or cease their use. Arms borne improperly were to be taken down and defaced. The first such visitation began in 1530, and the last was carried out in 1700, although no new commissions to carry out visitations were made after the accession of William III in 1689.Julian Franklyn, Shield and Crest: An Account of the Art and Science of Heraldry, London: MacGibbon & Kee (1960), p. 386. During the early modern period, heraldry became highly complex and standardised, divided into \\"national\\" traditions. Western heraldry can be divided into three large cultural groups, \\"Gallo-British\\", \\"German-Nordic\\" and \\"Latin\\". Part of the Gallo-British group are French, English and Scottish traditions. The \\"German- Nordic\\" group includes the tradition of the Holy Roman Empire and its greater sphere of incluence, including German heraldry, Swedish heraldry, Norwegian heraldry, Danish heraldry, Russian heraldry, Polish heraldry, Hungarian heraldry, Croatian heraldry, Serbian heraldry, etc. The \\"Latin\\" group includes Italian heraldry, Spanish heraldry and Portuguese heraldry. Dutch heraldry shows influence of all three groups. Prominent burghers and corporations, including many cities and towns, assumed or obtained grants of arms, with only nominal military associations.Peter Gwynn-Jones, The Art of Heraldry: Origins, Symbols, and Designs, Parkgate Books/Barnes & Noble (1998), pp. 18‚Äì20. Heraldic devices were depicted in various contexts, such as religious and funerary art, and in using a wide variety of media, including stonework, carved wood, enamel, stained glass, and embroidery.Ottfried Neubecker, Heraldry: Sources, Symbols and Meaning, Macdonald and Jane's (1977), pp. 253‚Äì258. With the abandonment of the joust as courtly practice at the beginning of the 17th century, heraldic achievements, especially the heraldry, ceased to be tied to the technological development or fashion of jousting armour and shapes of helmets became purely conventional, and in the various regional systems, separate types of helmets came to be tied to separate ranks of nobility. Baroque heraldic designs became increasingly elaborate, both in terms of the increasingly complex division of the field and in terms of the surrounding achievements, culminating in the development of \\"landscape heraldry\\", incorporating realistic depictions of landscapes, during the latter part of the eighteenth and early part of the nineteenth century. Modern heraldry In the mid-19th century, there was a renewed interest in the history of armory, but now mostly from an antiquarian's or genealogist's perspective. This led to a re-evaluation of older designs over Baroque and Roccoco styles, a new appreciation for the medieval origins of the art.Fox- Davies, A Complete Guide to Heraldry, pp. 87‚Äì88.Gwynn-Jones, pp. 110‚Äì112. Since the late nineteenth century, heraldry has focused on the use of varied lines of partition and little-used ordinaries to produce new and unique designs.Gwynn-Jones, pp. 113‚Äì121. The term \\"heraldry\\" is sometimes used to include the national emblems of modern states. Some modern states, especially constitutional monarchies, use national coats of arms (such as the coat of arms of Denmark or the coat of arms of Spain). States with republican tradition tend to avoid coats of arms, using \\"national seals\\" or \\"national emblems\\" instead, such as the national emblem of France, the national emblem of Turkey or the Great Seal of the United States. File:Wappen Deutsches Reich - Herzogtum Sachsen-Altenburg (Grosses).png19th-century German heraldry has examples of shields with numerous crests, as this arms of Saxe-Altenburg featuring a total of seven crests.

It continued to dominate religious architecture until the appearance of French Gothic architecture in the Ile-de-France between about 1140-1150. Distinctive features of French romansque architecture include thick walls with small windows, rounded arches; a long nave covered with barrel vaults; and the use of the groin vault at the intersection of two barrel vaults, all supported by massive columns; a level of tribunes above the galleries on the ground floor, and small windows above the tribunes; and rows of exterior buttresses supporting the walls. Churches commonly had a cupola over the transept, supported by four adjoining arches; one or more large square towers, and a semi-circular apse with radiating small chapels. Decoration usually included very ornate sculpted capitals on columns and an elaborate semi-circular sculpted tympanum, usually illustrating the Last Judgement, over the main portal. Interior decoration often included murals covering the walls, colored tiles, and early stained glass windows. Late in the 12th century, the rib vault began to appear, particularly in churches in Normandy and Paris, introducing the transition to the Gothic style. Characteristics=Plan= At the beginning of the eleventh century, inspired by the appearance of the style in northern Italy, Romanesque architecture spread west across southern France as far as Catalonia and Spain, and then north up the valley of the Rhone River. In the early Romanesque period, churches followed the traditional form of a Roman basilica, particularly the plan of the Byzantine Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna. They had a single long nave, usually without a transept, which ended in a hemispherical apse. They usually had at least one bell tower, sometimes separated from the Nave. In the later Romanesque period, in the last third of the 11th century, new building techniques were introduced which allowed taller and wider churches. Two new plans became common. The first was the Benedictine plan, used in Cluny Abbey and the other new Benedictine monasteries. It featured three naves, with a transept at the crossing, and ranks of small chapels on either side of the apse on the east end. A modified plan appeared in the new abbeys and churches designed to welcome pilgrims traveling to shrines in Spain. These new churches were designed to accommodate large numbers of visitors, and included an ambulatory, or walkway, leading to several small chapels radiating in a semicircle from the apse. The ambulatory allowed visitors to easily access any of the chapels, without disturbing the service in the nave. They often had multiple towers over the entrance and wings of the transept, and sometimes a dome over the crossing point of the transept and nave. Saint-Front de P√©rigueux, modeled after St Mark's Basilica in Venice, is an example.

Builders began to experiment with vaulted ceilings, first in the crypt below the church, and then in the nave. The earliest types were the simple barrel vault, which rested upon rows of massive columns. Later churches used the voute d'ar√™te or groin vault, two barrel vaults combined at right angles, which were stronger but required great skill to construct. Later in the period, the voute en berceau bris√©√© or rib vault was introduced, which carried the thrust of the weight of the roof outwards and downwards, through thin ribs, to supporting columns and buttresses. As the naves became higher and higher, with the weight pressing down and outward on the walls, the walls had to be supported by massive masonry buttresses on the outside. Because of the need for thick, solid walls, the windows were few and small in size. The ground floor had rows of massive columns, which supported the vaults of the roof. The walls were divided by thin colonettes, which also provided support to the roof. The domes were either supported by an octagonal base (Sur trompes) or a circular base (Sur pendentifs), composed of barrel arches meeting at right angles. The six-part rib vault, a key innovation in the transition to Gothic architecture, had been introduced in England in about 1100, and made its first appearance in France in the reconstruction of the naves of the church of the Abbey of Saint-√âtienne, Caen, The Abbey of Sainte- Trinit√©, Caen, in about 1120. It also appeared in Burgundy and in an experimental version at the Abbey of Vezelay at about the same time. These vaults allowed ceilings that were lighter and stronger, and carried the weight outwards to columns and buttresses, so the supporting walls could be higher and thinner, with larger windows.

The ground level of the nave was usually flanked by columned arcades. These were usually surmounted by tribunes, or a galleries, where the faithful could gather to watch the ceremony in the nave below. The level above the tribune usually had a row of windows bringing light into the interior. The tribunes provided greater width and support to the wall, which meant that churches could be higher. In some churches in the Auvergne region, the tribune rose up two levels, which meant that little light came into the nave. In Normandy, the tribune was often replaced by a Triforium, a narrow walkway. In Aquitaine, the churches had a single wide nave, which allowed more light to enter. Taller churches required heavy stone buttresses placed against the exterior walls to support the weight of the roof. This problem was not resolved until the Gothic period, when the introduction of the rib vault transferred the weight of the roof to the flying buttresses outside the walls.

The columns often had cubic carved capitals. Exterior decoration was usually either vegetal, such as carved acanthus leaves or palm fronds, or geometric forms. Occasionally sculpture with simplified human forms with biblical texts appeared on the lintels. However, with the construction of new abbeys and pilgrimage churches, the facades became much more theatrical. The Facade of the √âglise Notre-Dame la Grande, Poitiers is one of the best surviving examples of a Romanesque pilgrimage church facade. It does not have a sculpted tympanum over its portal; instead, the whole facade serves as a theater of biblical scenes; a frieze of sculptures over the portals represents the stories of the original sin and redemption; a multitude of small sculptures around the doors depicts fabulous animals and other biblical themes.

It was designed as the Porta Coeli or \\"Doorway to heaven\\", a depiction of biblical stories and images in stone, which in earlier churches had been shown on the sculpture of the altar. The usual themes of the portal were the Biblical Day of Judgement, promising Redemption for good Christians, and the Apocalypse for the others. Each church was different; at Moissac. the figure of Christ was surrounded by the four Evangelists, and the group was encircled by the twenty- four figures of the Apocalypse. The portal of Toulouse cathedral featured the Ascension of Christ, while the Abbey Church of Saint Foy illustrated the contrasts between hell and the virtuous life of Saint Foy. While the portals of cathedrals traditionally faced west, on Romanesque churches they often were oriented toward the main street or square of the town. In the Cathedral of Cahors it faced north, onto the ancient main street; in Toulouse and Moissiac it faced south, onto the street that led to the center of the town. One of the most famous sculptural works of the French Romanesque period is Moissac Abbey, a modest-sized abbey which had been a dependency of Cluny since 1047. It was commissioned by the Abbot Roger between 1115 and 1131. It is 5.63 meters in diameter, and is composed of twenty-eight blocks of stone, which were sculpted and then assembled. It depicts the Apocalypse as described in the Bible by Saint John. Christ is seated on a throne in the center, surrounded by a lion, a bull, an eagle in flight, and a human face, which in turn surrounded by twenty-eight seated wise men, who will make the Last Judgement.

In the early monastery churches the bell tower Was often separate from the church. In the later period, large abbey churches, like Cluny, had two towers at the portal end, a tower where the transept crossed the nave, and towers on the ends of transept. The main domes or cupolas were usually placed at crossing of the nave and the transept, and symbolized the heavens. They were often supported by four arches forming a square and supported by four massive pillars' which symbolically represented the four Evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. The pillars held up a Vo√ªte d'ar√™tes, or cross vault, where the barrels vaults of the nave and transept met at right angles. The curving triangular surfaces of these vaults, which joined the six or eight sides of the cupola to the four pillars, were called squinches', or pendentives, and were often decorated with the faces of the Four Evangelists, who were considered the symbolic link between the heavens and earth, or with angels or other Biblical figures.McNamara, Denise, Comprendre l'Art des Eglises (2017), LaRousse (in French), , pg. page 121 File:75BCluny.jpgThe surviving tower of Cluny Abbey File:Basilique St Sernin (1071046431).jpgTower of Basilica of Saint-Sernin, Toulouse File:Perigueux Cathedrale Saint Front.jpgFive domes and bell tower of Saint-Front Cathedral in Perigueux File:Conques, Aveyron.jpg Abbey Church of Saint Foy in Conques (11th-12th century) File:Abbatiale Conques Tour Lanterne.JPGThe lantern of the Abbey Church of Saint Foy in Conques (11th-12th century) The squinches joining the supporting arches of the lantern are decorated with sculpture of the Apostles.

History=Early Romanesque and the Meridional style= The Romanesque style in France developed first in the south of France, particularly in the provinces bordering on Catalonia. Among the best surviving examples are the church and cloister of the Abbey of Saint-Michel de Cuxa, built between 956 and 974. Churches in this region followed the plan of a basilica, with a small or no transept, They were built of massive stones, with little or no decoration on the interior walls. The bells were usually located in a separate tower, decorated with Lombard bands. The cloister of Saint- Michel de Cuxa, built in the 12th century, features columns of rose-colored marble and carved capitals in vegetal and animal shapes on the columns.Delamarre, Barbara, Architecture des √©glises romans in Mignon, Olivier, Architecture du Patromoine Fran√ßais (2017), √âditions Ouest-France, pages 68-69 Around the year 1000, The architects of the abbeys in Burgundy began experimenting with different forms of vaulted ceilings, at first largely to avoid the danger of fires on the wooden roofs. The church of the Benedictine Abbey of Saint-Philibert de Tournus was an early example. The nave was covered by transversal barrel vaults, perpendicular to the axis of the nave, supported by rows of columns. The weight of the roof pressed down on the columns, not on the walls, This meant that the walls could be thinner, and could have larger windows, filling the church with more light.

The reorganization of the Catholic Church under Louis the Pious (813-840), and the foundation of the first monastery under the rules of Saint Benedict (817), brought about important changes in religious practices and architecture. The Benedictine Abbey of Cluny, founded in 909 by William of Aquitaine, was the center of a resurgence of religious activity. In France, by the end of the 11th century, there were 815 monastic houses, and more than ten thousand monks, under the authority of the Abbot of Cluny. The flourishing of the monasteries reached a peak summit under Pope Gregory VII (1073-1085). Cluny Abbey was the largest and most influential of the monasteries in France, both in doctrine and in architecture. The Abbot Hugues de Cluny (1049-1109) decided to reconstruct and enlarge the original Abbey, including the Abbatiale, or Abbey church. The new Abbatiale was completed in 1130. The new church was 187 meters long, and designed to accommodate two hundred and fifty monks. It contained a double transept, an avant-nave on the west, and on the east a chevet with a disambulatoire passage which gave access to five radiating chapels. The nave itself was immense, covered with a vaulted ceiling 10.85 meter wide and 25 meters high. The elevation of the nave had three levels; the windows on the upper levels brought light into the interior. It was crowned by five towers, the largest over the crossing of grand transept, two on either side of the entrance to the avant-nave, and two on the arms of the transept. Its gigantic proportions were not surpassed until the reconstruction of Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome in the 16th century. Cluny Abbey was almost entirely destroyed during and after the French Revolution; the stones were reused in buildings across the region. The only remaining structures are the two towers of the avant-nave, and the bell tower on the south wing of the grand transept. Eight percent of the original structure remains today.

Its principal doctrines were defined by Saint Benedict as separation from society, working for the necessities of life, and the refusal of anything unneeded for the first two. The architecture of the new monasteries was designed to comply with these rules. The monasteries were built as far as possible from cities. The monks lived in unadorned buildings constructed around a cloister, isolated from the outside world and from other parts of the monastery. The monks had individual cells, each with three small rooms; The \\"Ave Maria\\" for prayer; a second room with a desk and an alive for a bed; and a third room for a workshop. Each later had its own garden. A second building contained the common areas for the monks; a church, the cloister, the capitulary or meeting room; the kitchen and dining room. A third building was added for converts who were not monks, but who wanted to share the monastic life. The order expanded to five monasteries; in France: Citeaux Abbey, Clairvaux Abbey, Morimond Abbey, Pontigny Abbey, and La Fert√© Abbey. These five became the \\"Mother houses\\" for new Cistercian monasteries across the European continent and in England. After the death of Saint Bernard in 1153, the standard church architecture was modified; the hemispherical or square sanctuary of the church was replaced by a chevet with an ambulatory to pass from chapel to chapel.

With the fall of Jerusalem under Islamic rule, the route to Santiago de Compostela became one of the two most important pilgrimage routes in Europe, beside the pilgrimage to the tomb of Saint Peter in Rome. Churches along the route, included the Saint-Foy-de- Conques, were designed to provide space for large numbers of worshippers. The large pilgrimage churches featured a deambulatoire or columned passage around the choir, providing access to a series of small chapels, and even larger pilgrimage church like the basilica of Saint-Sernin has double side aisles to facilitate the movement of pilgrims. Another smaller notable church on the route was the Abbey of Saint-Nectaire in Puy-de-D√¥me, begun in 1080. Another feature of the later Romanesque churches was greater height. These churches had a tribune or gallery on the level above the ground floor, where worshippers could look down into the Nave. The tribune provided greater stability and support for the high roof. In the Auvergne, the churches added another level; above the gallery there was another level of vaulted tribunes. These churches had great height but little light penetrated into the nave. In other regions, such as Poitou, the tribunes and arcades were replaced by high windows bringing light directly into the nave.

The nave was constructed between 990 and 1160, and the tower, with a high chapel on its ground floor, was built between 990 and 1014. The western portion of nave was constructed between 990 and 1160. The choir, in the center of the church, begun in 1145, was built in the new Gothic style, pioneered at the Abbey of Saint Denis. Other Romanesque churches in Paris include Saint-Martin-des-Champs Priory(1060-1147). The surviving buildings of the monastery now house the Mus√©e des Arts et M√©tiers of Paris. The walls of choir and chapels of the church are supported by early buttresses, and it features a Romanesque bell tower. The Church of Saint- Pierre de Montmartre (1147-1200), just below the top of the hill of Montmartre, was one of the first buildings in Paris, after the Abbey of Saint- Denis, to install rib vaults, which launched the transition from the Romanesque to the Gothic.

In Brittany, the local granite stone was very dense and too heavy for most roof structures; architects often preferred to cover the vaults with wood instead of stone. An example is the ceiling of the Abbatiale of the Abbey of Mont-San Michel. The use of wooden vaulted ceilings instead of stone allowed the construction of taller and longer churches; the nave of Saint-Melanie of Rennes is more than eighty meters long and ten meters high particularly at the crossing of the transept, the oldest part of the church. Romanesque churches in Normandy often featured narrow tribunes and wide bays, which gave greater space to the interior. The most notable Norman romanesque monuments are the two former abbey churches in Caen, both of which were remarkable for the height of their ceilings and their towers. They were both founded by William the Conqueror and constructed at the same time. The church of the Abbey of Saint-√âtienne, Caen also known as the Abbey aux Hommes, was built by William the Conqueror as the main church of the Abbey of Saint Stephen. The nave was constructed in about 1060-1065, and the twin towers in about 1120. The Abbey of Sainte-Trinit√©, Caen, known as the Abbey aux Femmes, was built at the same time for the Abbey of the Holy Trinity, but in a slightly different style. The construction of the two abbey churches saw the introduction of an important architectural innovation; a ceiling with an early form of rib vaults, used in both The Abbaye des Dames and the Abbaye des Hommes. The roof of the choir of the Abbaye des Dames was very high, eight meters, and in about 1100 to 1110 it began to show signs of weakness and was demolished, It was replaced in about 1120 by a rib vault, among the earliest in France, which allowed a lighter and stronger roof, and which permitted larger windows at the high level. Along with the very early experimental rib vaults at Vezelay Abbey and in Burgundy, this was one of the first rib vaults in France, and a notable predecessor of Gothic Architecture.

The earliest sculptural decorations on altars and the interior surfaces of churches, on lintels, over doorways and particularly on the capitals of columns, which were commonly adorned with images of biblical figures and real or mythical animals. Most of the work was almost flat with little attempt at realism. Some of the earliest Romanesque sculpture in France is found at Saint-G√©nis-des-Fontaines Abbey (1019-1020) in the eastern Pyrenees. A lintel over a doorway portrays Christ on a throne, in a frame supported by two angels, and flanked by the apostles. The forms of the apostles are defined by the shapes of the arches into which they are squeezed. In the later Romanesque period, sculpture was often used to at the most important points, such as the facades, to emphasize the lines of the structure. It often used geometric designs (circles, squares, triangles). Spaces were crowded with figures, which were often contorted so they seemed to be dancing. . The sculpture was most profuse on the capitals of columns and on the portals, where it was used to present very complex and extended biblical stories. Sculptors also depicted a large number of animals, both real and imaginary, including chimeras, sirens, lions, and a wide range of monsters. Imagination usually prevailed over realism. Some of the most remarkable sculpture is found on the tympanum and the capitals of the columns of the cloister of Moissac Abbey in Mossac, Tarne- et-Garonne, and the columns of the in Souillac in the Lot Department; and Saint-Philibert de Tournus Abbey in Burgundy.

The figures are much more realistic, and make skillful use of shadows and light to bring out the details. One of the most remarkable works is the altar table, signed by its sculptor, Bernardus Geldvinus. He also made the seven sculptural reliefs found in the ambulatory of the cathedral. File:Adam et √àve chass√©s du Paradis (3186534504).jpgCapital of a column depicting Adam and Eve being chased from Paradise, in the Basilica of Saint- Sernin, Toulouse File:Anonyme toulousain - Chapiteau de colonne simple , Lianes et feuillages enroul√©s - Mus√©e des Augustins - ME 213 (2).jpgCapital of a column in the Basilica of Saint-Sernin, Toulouse, depicting foliage In the middle and late 12th century, the sculptural decoration became much more realistic, detailed, and finely sculpted. Notable examples are the facade of the west portal of the Church of St. Trophime, Arles from the end of the 12th century, decorated with stately figures of the apostles, and the capitals of the double columns in the cloister, each one different, illustrating parsonages from the Bible. third of the 12th century, The sculpture at Arles demonstrates the extent to which Romanesque had become an international style. The left side of the west portal of the Church of St. Trophime, Arles (late 12th century) depicts the Apocalypse according to Saint John. The use of sculpted lions' heads to support the pilasters is borrowed from Italy, and a number of the figures on the capitals in the cloister, illustrating the Three Kings and the flight from Egypt, were made by Benedetto Antelami, one of the master Romanesque sculptors of Italy. V√©zelay Abbey is also famous for its rich and complex tympanum, sheltered within the large porch of the church. Its theme is the Pentecost, with biblical stories, and how the message of Christ was being spread to the different peoples of the world, as well as images of the mythical creatures who were believed to live at the edges of the world. It was made in tn th 12th century, when Vezelay was considered an important intellectual center. under one of its Abbots, Peter the Venerable. Another famous tympani is that of the Abbey Church of Saint Foy, in Conques, in which some one hundred characters are depicted in vivid scenes from the Last Judgement.

The exceptions were the abbeys of the Cistercians, which contained no decoration at all. Most of the murals were destroyed in the 18th and 19th century, when it was felt that a bare stone wall was more appropriate for a church interior. Two different techniques were usually used; either a fresco, painted while the plaster was still wet with paint diluted with water; or d√©trempe, painted the pigments mixed with a binder, such as an oil or eggwhite, and painted on dry plaster. Often both techniques were used, with the large designs painted as a fresco, and the details d√©tremps. The work required rapid execution. The subjects were chosen by the Church hierarchy, not by the artists, and the names of the artists, in most cases, remained unknown. The walls of Romanesque churches were rarely left bare. Many Romanesque church interiors were painted with cycles of illustrations of Biblical stores. Sometimes the topics were of local interest; the paintings at Saint-Martin-de-Vic illustrate how the monks of Tours stole relics from the Monastery of Poitiers. The paintings were not limited to the interiors, and often also covered the tympanums capitals, and other exterior decoration. The sculpture in the interior was also commonly painted. Wooden church ceilings, common before the wide use of rib arches, were also usually painted. An early example of a painted church is Berz√©-la- Ville, where the paintings on the ceiling of the Chapel of the Monks depict the moment that Christ gave the apostles Peter and Paul the messages to spread to the world. One of the most important existing examples of a painted French Romanesque church is Abbey Church of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe in Poitou. It was founded in the 9th century over the tombs of the Christian martyrs Sabinus of Spoleto and Saint Cyprian, and in the Middle Ages became a major pilgrimage church. Beginning in about 1100, the church was enlarged and entirely painted inside, from the crypt to the ceiling, The faux-marble of the columns in the nave were also painted.{ The architecture of the church. including the placement of the arches and vaults, was designed to make the paintings, the main attraction, more easily visible.

The most common tiles were simple baked earth, given a reddish color by iron oxide, mixed with tiles colored yellow by litharge, a form of lead oxide. Darker or lighter colored tiles were made by varying the time of baking. Usually only two colors were used, to give greater harmony. One of the most notable early examples is the tile floor surrounding the tomb of King Philip I of France, in Fleury Abbey in Saint-Benoit-sur-LoireDe Morant (1970), page 268 One of the most famous late examples is the Church of Saint-Pierre-sur-Dives in Calvados, Normandy (13th century). The floor of the nave has a circular design three meters in diameter, made of colorful tiles in concentric circles. alternating yellow on black with black on yellow. The tiles are illustrated with deer, lizards, chimeras, and two-headed eagles, along with flour-des-lys and palmettes.De Morant (1970) page 268 File:Saint-Beno√Æt-sur-Loire - Abbatiale Saint-Beno√Æt 21.jpgGeometric tile floor in Fleury Abbey in Saint-Benoit-sur- Loire File:Abbaye Saint-Pierre-sur-Dives pavement.JPGChoir floor of Saint- Pierre-sur-Dives in Calvados File:Abbaye de Saint-Pierre-sur-Dives - pavage du ch≈ìur.JPGDetail of the choir floor of Saint-Pierre-sur-Dives in Calvados =Stained glass= The art of making stained glass had been used to make colored glass goblets, bottles, and lamps as early as the 8th century. Early glass window panes appeared in Syria and Egypt in the 8th century, and in France under the Emperor Charlemagne. The earliest glass windows were clear to give maximum light, since the windows were small and the church interiors were already very dark. Clear glass windows appeared during the Romanesque period in the Abbeys of the Cistercians, at Bonlieu Abbey in the Creuse, Aubazine in Correze, Saint Serge in Angers, and others. The glass was very thin, no more than half a centimeter, and very fragile. It was also very difficult to cut, since the use of diamonds to cut glass had not been discovered; glass was cut with heated irons. Cobalt oxide was used to make a fine deep blue, green and red from copper, purple from manganese, and yellow from iron and manganese.De Morand (1975) pages=268-69 An important development took place in the 11th century, when wooden frames were replaced by frames of lead, which allowed more varied designs and pieces of many different sizes. Very early stained glass windows were in place at the Abbey of Monte Casino in Italy in 1071. The earliest known stained glass window in France is a head of Christ from the 11th century, which was originally in the Abbey of Wissembourg.De Morand (1975) pages=268-69 One of the earliest stained glass windows installed in France was the Crucifixion window of Poitiers Cathedral, put in place in The installation of new stained glass windows by the Abbot Suger in the choir of the Abbey of Saint-Denis in the mid-12th century was one of the decisive steps of the transition from the Romaneque to the Gothic style. Thereafter, stained glass, not murals, became the most prominent decorative element of French cathedrals.

Previously, the residences of nobles and fortifications had usually been built of wooden walls or earthen palisades. The frequency of invasions and wars, and the improvements in siege engines, made it necessary to build stronger fortresses of stone. Only the nobles of the highest level were permitted by the King to build fortified residences. The new castles of the nobility were not only military defenses, but also symbols of the rank and power of the nobles. The typical castles of this period had a high tower, called a donjon or keep, usually surrounded by a lower wall, called a shell keep. The earliest were rectangular, but were usually replaced by a round or octagonal tower. The earliest surviving vestiges are at Dou√© le Fontaine in Maine-et-Loire (about 950). and Langeais (about 1017) The Caesar Tower in Provins from the beginning of the 12th century, has an octagonal tower flanked by four semi-circular towers, all placed on top of a stone platform seventeen meters by seventeen meters. A walkway midway up the main tower gives access to the corner towers. The whole structure is surrounded by another wall, the shell keep, on the ground level. The largest and most powerful castle of the period was the original Louvre in Paris, begun in about 1200 by King Philip II of France, and completed in the 13th century. Only the massive foundations remain; they are visible on the ground floor under the Louvre Museum. The sprawling ruins of another castle from this period, Druyes-les-Belles-Fontaines, begun in 1200, can be found in the Yonne Department.

The main examples are the episcopal palaces of bishops, notably in Auxerre and in Saint-Antonin. Their principal features are galleries and arcades along the length of the facade. on the facade. One famous example Romanesque civic architecture is the Pont Saint-B√©n√©zet, better known as the Bridge of Avignon.

He was the son of Mathieu, lord of Marly, and grandson of Mathieu I, baron of Montmorency. Bouchard is a Norman form of the German name Burchard, carried by his 10th-century ancestor, Bouchard I of Montmorency. His father had participated in the Fourth Crusade and, unlike the French contingent led by Simon IV of Montford, had ventured as far as Constantinople, where he died shortly after the sack of the city on 27 August 1204. Bouchard de Marly in 1204 sponsored the foundation of the abbey of Port-Royal des Champs. In 1209, he participated in the Albigensian Crusade, where he joined Simon of Montford who was married to Alix de Montmorency, one of his cousins. In c. 1209, he married Mathilde de Ch√¢teaufort, a daughter of Gasce de Poissy, with whom he had five children, the oldest being abbot and saint Theobald of Marly. Bouchard was given the possessions of Saissac and of Saint-Martin-en-Languedoc by Simon. In late 1209, Bouchard is captured by Pierre-Roger de Cabaret and kept as prisoner at Lastours for two years. Simon laid siege to Lastours in the spring of 1211, and Pierre-Roger de Cabaret released Bouchard as an emissary presenting his terms of surrender. Bouchard then participated in the siege of Lavaur (May 1211), and relieved Simon at the siege of Castelnaudary. He was present at Simon's siege of Toulouse (June 1211), the Battle of Muret (12 September 1213) and the second siege of Toulouse (1217/8). Simon died when this siege was in its ninth month, on 25 June 1218, and Bouchard now followed Simon's son, Amaury VI de Montfort, and later participated in the renewed crusade declared by Louis VIII of France in 1225. He was killed in this campaign, during Louis' siege of Avignon, on 13 September 1226. He was buried at Port-Royal des Champs. Bouchard used the coat of arms of the lords of Montmorency, or a cross gules, quarterly four eagles (alerions?) azure, attested (without tincture) in a heraldic seal used in 1225.A.

The arms of Montmorency are later described as or a cross gules, quarterly four alerions azure, and the coat of arms of Bourchard II as distinguished from that of Montmorency by the cross being shown as fretty. :fr:Armorial des Montmorency: Montmorency: or √† la croix de gueules cantonn√©e de quatre al√©rions d'azur, Bouchard II de Marly: d'or √† la croix de gueules frett√©e d'argent cantonn√©e de quatre al√©rions d'azur. The seal of Mathieu II does not indicate the fretty variation. He was succeeded as lord of Marly, Montreuil- Bonnin and Picauville by his son Pierre (d. 1240), who was in turn succeeded by his brother younger brother, Bouchard II (d. 1250). Bouchard II was succeeded by his son, Mathieu II, Grand Chamberlain of France (d. 1280). Mathieu II was succeeded by his son, Mathieu III (d. 1305), who was in turn succeeded by his son, Louis de Marly. Louis died without issue in c. 1356, and the possession of Marly and Picauville passed to the House of L√©vis. Marly was acquired by Louis XIV of France in 1676, from which time it came to be known as Marly-le-Roi.

Eight people died, with a resulting public inquiry linking all the deaths to the hotel's potted duck- paste. Loch Maree was a popular location for holiday makers, sports fishermen and romantic breaks and interest in the event was heightened by the hotel's scenic location. The incident ultimately led to the establishment of regulations to control home-canning in Scotland. Background A photomicrograph of Clostridium botulinum bacteria Multiple deaths caused by botulism had occurred in 1920 in the United States when the origin was found to be glassed olives. Previously, there had been an outbreak associated with sausages from W√ºrttemberg in Germany. Chronology=14 August 1922= On 14 August 1922, a group of 13 sports fishermen, 2 of their wives, 17 gillies and 3 mountain climbers were present at the Loch Maree Hotel on the edge of Loch Maree in the Scottish Highlands. Totalling 35, they took packed lunches prepared by the hotel staff. Forty-eight people dined at the hotel that evening, and the gillies returned home to their cottages. There were no complaints of illness that evening. =15 August 1922= At 3 am, John Stewart, age 70, who had been visiting the hotel regularly for the previous 40 years, was the first guest to fall ill with vomiting and drooped eyelids. Alex Robertson, the owner, called Dr. Knox, the local physician. But, by the time he came later in the morning, several others became ill and he in turn called upon T. K. Monro, Regius Professor of Medicine and Therapeutics at Glasgow University, who happened to be nearby. However, by the time Monro arrived, 9 pm that day, the first fatality had occurred. The doctors then went to visit a gillie who had become ill and after returning to the hotel, witnessed the second fatality. Loch Maree and Slioch =16 August 1922= By midday on 16 August 1922, there was a third death and a second gillie had also fallen sick. A number of physicians, many of whom were holidaying in and around the hotel, were also now involved. Baffled by the unusual presentations and the associated sudden fatality, food-poisoning was suspected. The public prosecutor was now informed and the incident became a legal case and crime scene with the primary suspect being the hotel's owner until Monro suggested foodborne disease. =17‚Äì21 August 1922= By the end of 17 August, there were six deaths. The final two deaths occurred on 21 August, just less than a week after the first person fell ill. There were no other cases. The symptoms were similar but varied in time of onset and in severity. Investigation The inquiry at Dingwall Sheriff Court, September 1922 The attending physicians had suspected food poisoning early in the week and began inquiries. Medical officer of health, William MacLean, reported to the public prosecutor that \\"the symptoms and course of the disease are identical in essentials with those described by Van Ermengem as his ‚Äòsecond type‚Äô in his investigations of sausage poisoning in the eighteen-nineties\\". A second inquiry also began in the first week, on behalf of the Scottish health board by Dr Dittmer. This was to prevent further occurrences and to allay public fear. All eight victims were the only members of the group to have eaten duck-paste sandwiches. The duck-paste was home-canned by hotel staff. A detailed assessment of the making up of sandwiches, including how many sandwiches were placed in each packed- lunch was made. Two glass pots of meat were used, each providing for nine or 12 sandwiches, or a total of 18 or 24. Twenty lots of sandwiches were made that day using the contents of two containers of potted wild duck paste and ham and tongue. Other sandwiches were also made from ingredients including beef, ham, jam and eggs. Investigators obtained the little that remained of the left-over food from the hotel rubbish. Botulinum toxin was found in the remains of a wild duck paste and samples sent to the distinguished microbiologist Bruce White. The most significant sample was from one of the ill gillie's leftover potted duck sandwich, which was buried in a garden by a colleague to avoid the hens eating it. Wrapped in paper, it was recovered during the night of the 17 August, fully intact. The origins of the potted meat were traced. Four jars of the meat were purchased from Lazenby's of London in June 1922 and included \\"chicken, ham, and turkey, all mixed with tongue; and wild duck\\". The Lazenby production plant was scrutinised too but all was found to be in good working order. The public enquiry was held in March 1922, with intense publicity. At one time, one tabloid named the hotel \\"The Hotel of Death\\". Witness accounts Loch Maree Hotel in 2000 The future air marshal Sir Thomas Elmhirst described how, as a young guest at the hotel, he narrowly avoided being poisoned when he joined his brother and parents there for a week of fishing. Arriving late, they were given ham sandwiches rather than potted meat, which had run out, and thus were saved. Elmhirst recorded how a judge in the room next to him suffered a painful death while a major and his wife, who were guests, gave their sandwich to their gillie as they never ate potted meat. The gillie later died. Reaction and legacy As the first recorded outbreak of botulism in the United Kingdom, the incident resulted in extraordinary publicity. The area was a popular location for holiday makers, sports fishermen and romantic breaks and the poisoning occurred in the height of the holiday season. The hotel's scenic location made the unusual interest in the tragedy even more extensive. The incident ultimately led to the establishment of regulations to control home-canning in Scotland. In addition, anti-toxins were made more easily available and packaging of preserved food was changed to allow easier identification of its origin. However, botulism did not became a notifiable disease in the UK until 1949. The events at Loch Maree are now used as a case study in the detection of food poisoning. Similar outbreaks are considered rare, with 17 incidents reported in the UK between 1922 and 2011, including a large outbreak in 1989 connected to hazelnut yoghurt and an episode in 2011 with a suspected link to a korma sauce.

It was built during 1875 for William Andrews and Edward Baker. It is also known as Bakers Terrace. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  Available historical information suggests the subject site was in use for residential purposes by the start of the 19th century. Initially this may have been for a freestanding building, but from the 1830s the historical maps suggest the area was largely terrace style housing. In 1807, this site is shown by Meehan's survey to contain what appears to be a well defined building line to the west and a lane on the northern boundary. Artists' representations of the area from as early as 1803 reveal many small houses in the general vicinity. By 1835, the date of Russell's survey, the site was known as allotment 1A (Nos.66-68) of section 77 in the Town of Sydney. This allotment was originally one parcel with allotment 1B (Nos.70-72) to the south. It was granted to Johanna Davis by the Court of Claims Commissioners appointed in 1835 having been claimed originally by the children of Richard Porter. Court of Claims records indicate that this site (allotment 1A & 1B) had been occupied for some years prior to 1819 and since that date by a chain of purchasers. In 1837, Denis Murphy claimed the northern half of the site (1A) which, on Russell's survey, possessed a building which occupies most of the site. Mrs Davies retained allotment 1B (70-72) and in 1845 Council Rate Assessors noted Denis Murphy as the Proprietor and Patrick Ryan the tenant of a two-room stone house with a shingled roof in \\"bad repair (with) no outhouses\\". They also noted two small stone cottages with shingled roofs on the site: the northernmost containing two rooms, the other three. Both were described as in \\"bad repair (with) no outhouses\\". The width of the building was measured as 26 feet and the depth14 feet. From 1851-, John Sims was the proprietor and in this period the building was continually described as an old house in bad repair. By the 1865 Trigonometrical Survey, the site contained four residential buildings, numbered 46, 48, 50 and 52 Gloucester Street. The Sands Directories for this period indicate a large number of residents in the street. Those listed with occupations are usually tradesmen or worked in the maritime industries. In 1871 no entry is recorded for the site. In 1877, William Andrews is noted as the owner of a two-storey brick terrace of two houses, each with five rooms. The northern two houses, 46 and 48, were generally tenanted throughout the period recorded by the Sands Directories. 50 and 52 were sometimes untenanted and no tenants were recorded in No. 50 between 1863 and 1871, when the site is noted as \\"vacant land\\". This is consistent with the rate records indicating at least some of the buildings on the site were in poor repair. No tenants are recorded for the year 1881, consistent with the buildings being demolished for the construction of Baker's Terraces. In 1880 Edward Baker was the owner and though the evidence for this is not clear, according to Dove's 1880 plan of the area, the buildings at No. 50 and 52 are single storey and set further west, out of alignment with the row of buildings. Baker may have merely demolished the single storey buildings and constructed two new buildings. The different roof pitch and the presence of the box gutter in the northern two buildings suggest this may be the case. The buildings were later unified through a new fa√ßade on Gloucester Street. Between 1880 and 1882, Baker purchased the two adjoining properties to the south and erected two brick terraces on these. Between 1882 & 1887 Baker added new fronts to his original terraces so that the four became a matched unit. At this later date the terrace was known as Baker's Terrace. The terrace has remained essentially unaltered from that date and was tenanted as a residential unit until 1976. In 1890, the street was renumbered and Baker's Terrace became Nos. 66, 68, 70 and 72. In 1988‚Äì89, the terraces at 68-72 Gloucester Street, were adapted for use as a restaurant and office, as part of the seven storey Harrington Court development designed by Mitchell Giurgola Thorp at 77-95 Harrington Street, on the site bounded by Harrington Street, Cumberland Place, Gloucester Street and the Cahill Expressway. In 1989, the Harrington Court development was leased for a period of 99 years.SCRA, Annual Reports 1988, 1989, 1990  Description  Style: Victorian Terrace; Storeys: Two; Roof Frame: Iron (possibly slate original). The two buildings are two pairs of terrace houses which are joined to each other. The two pairs of buildings read as similar buildings to the street, however have different forms and features behind the fa√ßade and to the rear (Cambridge Street - Cumberland Place). The front of 66-68 was rebuilt 1880s to match the new terrace pair at 70-72 Gloucester Street. The building presents an ashlar rendered masonry parapet wall to Gloucester Street, all doors and windows have arched heads, defined by a rendered string course. The window and door joinery appears to have been replaced to original/traditional detail, and the door frames are possibly original fabric. The parapet wall has a prominent cornice supported on Italianate style paired brackets. There are two dormer gables to the roof, which are traditional in form, but do not appear to be original. The decorative rendered chimneys appears to be original. The rear of the building appears largely in original form, although the rear yard has been incorporated into the landscaping of the public pedestrian area. The interiors were not inspected. = Condition = As at 21 April 2000, the terrace is in very good condition as a result of the work carried out in the late 1980s.Wyborn, P. 1999. Archaeology Assessment Condition: Partly disturbed. The terraces were renovated and restored in the late 1980s, however the brief held instructions to prevent any removal or destruction of artefacts, or the return to the Authority of any which had to be removed. During the works fill was introduced to the site, and concrete was underlain with polyethylene film which may seal archaeological deposits. It appears the only excavation necessary was minimal required for the upgrading of services to the buildings. = Modifications and dates = *New fronts *1988-89Adaptation for restaurant and office use as part of the Harrington Court development.  Heritage listing  As at 20 January 2009, Baker's Terrace and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The site has been continually occupied since very early settlement and has strong associations with the early grants and subsequent developments on the site and The Rocks generally. This terrace is a good example of both the terrace style of residential development and the subdivision patterns that occurred in the mid Victorian period of Sydney particularly in The Rocks precinct. The rear of the buildings reflect the architectural response to the sloping topography of The Rocks. Baker added new fronts to the adjoining terraces to the north such that the four terraces became one unit in appearance. This addition is aesthetically interesting, it is a unique surviving example of such practice in The Rocks and it is deemed rare in Sydney and NSW terms. By 1887 they were known as Baker's Terrace. The terrace has remained essentially unaltered from 1887 and was tenanted as a residential unit until 1976/77. The site's changing use reflects the urban, economic and social development of the area. It also reflects the working and lower middle class lifestyles of the early twentieth century and the two storey scale of the area which predominated in the pre bridge area. Bakers Terrace is held in high esteem as indicated by its listing on the registers of both the National Estate and National Trust, and thus is recognised by an identifiable group and has importance to the wider community. Bakers Terrace hold social significance for the local residents of The Rocks including Millers Point who have fought hard for the retention of the built fabric of The Rocks and for their right to continue living in the area. In addition, it has a special significance for those who campaigned vigorously with the residents against plans for the areas full scale redevelopment. It has special value to historians and heritage professionals and others who hold The Rocks in high regard for its historical, archaeological and architectural significance and research potential. The site contains potential archaeological remains which may provide information on the way of life and aspirations of the inhabitants over time. The site has the potential to reveal information about construction techniques associated with residential dwellings of the period and the subsurface archaeological remains may provide information about former dwellings and land use on the site. Bakers terrace is representative of a number of two storey terraces built for residential use in The Rocks, many of which have now disappeared.Futurepast Heritage Consulting Pty Ltd. 2007 Baker's Terrace was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Baker's Terrace and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The site has been continually occupied since very early settlement and has strong associations with the early grants and subsequent developments on the site and The Rocks generally. This terrace is a good example of both the terrace style of residential development and the subdivision patterns that occurred in the mid Victorian period of Sydney particularly in The Rocks precinct. Baker added new fronts to the adjoining terraces to the north such that the four terraces became one unit in appearance. By 1887 they were known as Baker's Terrace. The terrace has remained essentially unaltered from 1887 and was tenanted as a residential unit until 1976/77 they were updated in the late 1980s. Bakers Terrace is important in demonstrating the development of The Rocks over time, and the continued pressure for greater density within the inner suburbs of Sydney. The swift decline of the building from its construction in the 1880s to slumlike conditions by the early 20th century demonstrates the rapid change in the fortunes of The Rocks and of its residents. Its subsequent restoration is an important part of the story of the conservation of The Rocks as a historic precinct and in the development of heritage conservation in Australia. The site's changing use reflects the urban, economic and social development of the area. It also reflects the working and lower middle class lifestyles of the early twentieth century and the two storey scale of the area which predominated in the pre bridge area. The rear of the buildings reflect the response to building on an uneven site. As a part of the substantial collection of 19th Century residential buildings in The Rocks, both Bakers Terraces as a whole, and its two original components at 66-68 and 70-72 Gloucester Street separately meet this criterion at a State level. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. While the name of the builder, Edward Baker, is known, as well as names of many of the 19th and 20th century residents, none of them are associated with any events of particular historical note. The item does not meet this criterion. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Bakers Terrace contributes strongly to the character of The Rocks, and it is an important part of the streetscape of Gloucester Street. The terraces show many of the typical features of the worker's terraces erected in Sydney in the middle Victorian period. They are well scaled buildings and good examples of their size and type. Baker added new fronts to the adjoining terraces to the north such that the four terraces became one unit in appearance. This action is indicative of one way of thinking, as it was apparently undertaken with the presumption that one larger building will present as being of greater status than two smaller, and to that degree which made the whole exercise perceived as feasible. By 1887 they were known as Baker's Terrace. The terrace has remained essentially unaltered from 1887 and was tenanted as a residential unit until 1976/77. Bakers Terrace as a whole meets this criterion at a State level. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The site's changing use reflects the urban, economic and social development of the area. It also reflects the working and lower middle class lifestyles of the early twentieth century and the two storey scale of the area which predominated in the pre bridge area. The rear of the buildings reflect the response to building on an uneven site. Bakers Terrace is held in high esteem as indicated by its listing on the registers of both the National Estate and National Trust, and thus is recognised by an identifiable group and has importance to the wider community. Bakers Terrace hold social significance for the local residents of The Rocks including Millers Point who have fought hard for the retention of the built fabric of The Rocks and for their right to continue living in the area. In addition, it has a special significance for those who campaigned vigorously with the residents against plans for the area's full scale redevelopment. It has special value to historians and heritage professionals and others who hold The Rocks in high regard for its historical, archaeological and architectural significance and research potential. Bakers Terrace as a whole meets this criterion at a State level. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site contains potential archaeological remains which may provide information on the way of life and aspirations of the inhabitants over time. The site has the potential to reveal information about construction techniques associated with residential dwellings of the period and the subsurface archaeological remains may provide information about former dwellings and land use on the site. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. While terrace housing is common across Sydney, Bakers Terrace is one of a relatively small number of surviving terrace-style houses within The Rocks area, as many were lost to clearance and the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Cahill Expressway. It is also a rare surviving example of a fa√ßade deliberately created to incorporate two originally separate buildings. Bakers Terrace meets this criterion at a State level. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The buildings at 66-68 & 70-72 Gloucester Street individually are typical of late Victorian terrace houses, with the unusual characteristic of incorporating parts of two earlier terrace houses into a single structure. Within The Rocks, each building separately and Bakers Terrace as a whole, are important in demonstrating the terrace style housing as a widespread and important change to the housing styles in mid 19th century inner Sydney, created in response to the increasing population density. Bakers Terrace meets this criterion at a local level.

Warner blends photography and art to make highly conceptual visual images. Based in London, Warner's 25-year career spans still life, advertising and photography. He is best known for his intricate food landscapes where he uses different types of foods and ingredients. He aims to inspire people to look at food in different ways. He is also known for his Bodyscapes.  Early life and education  Warner was born in Liverpool, England in 1963. Warner attended Maidstone College of Art with the intention of becoming an illustrator. He later found photography to be his preferred medium, as it was faster and more exciting. In 1982, after a year of college he moved to the London College of Printing to complete a degree in photography, film and television. In 1985, he started assisting David Lowe, a photographer based in Knightsbridge, London. There he met advertising industry professionals such as art directors, model makers and retouchers. After a year of assisting Lowe, he set up his own studio and began creating work for advertising agencies, design groups and PR houses. Warner now lives in Kent and works from his studio based in London.  Artist =Foodscapes= After his success on the internet creating food art images, he began to make more elaborate works, often made to look like famous landmarks, and always made out of real food. The goal of these projects is to trick the human eye into thinking the scene is real at first glance, and Warner uses anything from fresh vegetables and fruits to bread, cheese, and sometimes meat and fish, as well as Tungsten lights in order to create the appearance of sunlight. These elaborate Foodscapes are his most popular work and he often gets hired to create them for large food production companies. =Bodyscapes= Warner's more recent Bodyscapes is a series of bodyscapes which repeat body parts in a pattern that creates the illusion of a landscape. This piece is meant to redefine portraiture by focusing on the importance of every part of our bodies. Warner creates these portraits by photographing the body parts individually and editing them together in order to create a landscape effect. =Pizzascapes= Warner created Pizzascapes as a promotional project for DiGiorno Pizza. The project includes 20 different artworks depicting pizzas in scenes relevant to the pizza toppings, such as a pineapple pizza appearing to be in an island landscape. The backgrounds of these images were created out of a combination of figurines and food; many depict tiny people assembling or interacting with the pizzas.  Director = Television advertisements = Warner has set up his own production company known as Frooty Films in June 2014. Within the company he has directed and created television commercials for Nestl√©, Honey Nut Cheerios, Moe's Southwest Grill and the Milan EXPO 2015. The Milan Expo in 2015 focused on Feeding the planet. UK Trade and Investment partnered with Warner to display the UK's impact in global agriculture innovation. Warner created a series of animations using beans, rice, coffee and maize to illustrate the UK's global solutions to feeding the planet. His commercial was titled Resilient Rice. Warner has closely collaborated with Moe's Southwest Grill to create new augmented reality foodscapes made with Moe's fresh ingredients. Furthermore, Warner is developing an educational TV program for children including characters made out of healthy food, with the purpose of encouraging healthy eating for children.  Photographer  Most of Warner's work has been in advertising. Warner is considered more of a photographic illustrator who creates and transforms one thing into another using composition and lighting. The scenes are photographed in layers from foreground to background. The process is time consuming and the food quickly wilts under the lights. Each element is then put together in post production to achieve the final image. = Other worlds = The goal with Warner's other world photography is to use objects that people would not normally take the time to look at. Warner finds beauty in the mundane and the banal, in creating landscapes from the contents of a fridge or building cities from sea shells or car parts. = Still life = Through his own studio Warner created still life photography for Nestl√©, Unilever, Hugo Boss, and Whiskas.  Published works = Carl Warner's Food Landscapes = Food Landscapes was published in 2010 by Harry N. Abrams in New York. The book collects Warner's early works spanning from 1998. It shows behind the scenes images of Warner and his team assembling the structures. It covers details of what inspired each Foodscape and how each was created from initial sketches through to the ingredients used in the photography. = A World of Food: Discover Magical Lands Made of Things You Can Eat! = Warner's second book, A World of Food, is a children's book published in 2012 by Harry N. Abrams. Each Foodscape is composed primarily of a single color and is accompanied by poems written by Warner. Each image is composed entirely from foods from around the world. With this book, Warner hopes to alter children's perception of food and educate them about healthy eating and nutrition.

It was built from 1886. It is also known as Stafford Terrace; Stafford Apartments and 75 Harrington Street; Clocktower Development. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  In 1807 the site formed part of the garden of the Colony's hospital. After the formation of Harrington Street in 1810, a portion comprising 17 perches on the western side of the street was granted to a William Lea. The site was allotment 10 in Section 79 as show on an 1835 survey. By 1835, when the site was surveyed by Robert Russell, two buildings were located on the site. In 1845 the City Council assessed the northern building as a four-room brick house with shingled roof and the southern L shaped building as a four-room stone house with shingled roof in bad repair. In relation to the condition of the northern house in 1863 the assessor commented that \\"part of (the) front (had) fallen down'. The 1865 trigonometrical survey shows the footprint of two houses on the site, which appear to indicate new development, when compared to the 1835 survey. Percy Dove's 1880 map shows a two storey pair of terraces on the northern section, separated by a passage from the single storey shingled pair of cottages on the southern portion. The Lea family retained the property until . In 1885 both buildings have been demolished and in a seven house, two storey terrace known as Stafford Terrace was constructed on the lot. In 1891 John Varley was assessed as proprietor of the land. The land and buildings changed hands on at least two further occasions between 1871 and 1900, when the NSW Government resumed the land and buildings. The houses were tenanted as residential units. The name of \\"Stafford Terrace\\" first appeared in the 1890 Sand Directory, when the terraces were numbered as 9-21 Harrington Street. The numbering changed in 1924 to 47-59 Harrington Street. In 1940 the northern half (four houses) of the building was demolished to make way for the expanding meatworks complex on the corner of Harrington and Argyle Streets. The remaining houses were tenanted until the mid-1970s. Entries in various Sands Directories indicate that in the late 19th century there was a large turnover of tenants in the terraces. In 1900 when the NSW Government resumed the land and buildings they were tenanted as residential units until the mid 1970s. After the 1900 Government resumption tenants spent an average of 6 to 8 years in the tenancy. Alfred W. Moore lived from 1902 to 1919 in 55 Harrington Street, which was numbered 17 Harrington Street in this period. Leslie Petersen was a tenant in 59 Harrington Street between 1919 and 1931 and moved to 55 Harrington Street in 1932, where he lived until his death in 1962. His wife, Mrs E. M. Petersen remained in the tenancy until 1973. In the 1930s and 40s the terraces at 57 and 59 were shared tenancies, tenants paying per week. Sydney Cove Authority tenancy records provide evidence of the everyday existential problems of tenants, noting a large turnover of tenants, endless rental arrears and requests for rental reduction. In February 1946 Leslie Peterson, long-term resident in 55 Harrington Street complained that \\"Building operations of Messrs Playfairs factory has deprived them of sunlight. Reduction of rental is sought to offset increased electricity consumption\\". Tenancy records note a number of smaller refurbishments, repair and improvement, which the Maritime Services Board carried out on the terraces after 1927. The tenant's request for renovation and repair in the late 1940s and early 1950s indicate that by this time the terraces were in a rundown condition. A comparison of the footprint of the terraces shown on the late-19th century survey map and the survey prepared for the site of the Clock Tower development in 1986 indicates a few changes to the configuration of the property, the most obvious being the loss of four terraces at the northern end of the group. The three southernmost terraces remain on the site. Minor changes included modification of the rear boundary line and remodelling of the single storey rear wing of the terraces. During the redevelopment of the block in the 1980s the single storey rear sections of the terraces were demolished. The refurbishment also involved the re-roofing of the terraces, replacement of all floors, first floor in timber boarding and the ground floor in concrete and replacement of original features such as all stairs, fireplaces, doors and windows with replicated elements. Due to the difficulty in housing building workers on the development site, the terraces were initially used as temporary accommodation until such time that sheds could be set up on concrete decks. The terrace is now part of the Clocktower Development designed by Michael Dysart, Architects, which comprises 55 serviced apartments, 35 shops, commercial office space and a car park, constructed 1986‚Äì89.Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority, Annual Reports, 1987-89. The apartments are known as the Stafford Apartments, with the address, 75 Harrington Street. Archaeology Notes: Buildings shown on this site in Russell's survey of January 1835. Partially occupied by a grant to W. A. B. Lea, of George and Liverpool Streets, of Lot 10, Section 79 of January 1840.  Description  55-59 Harrington Street is a Victorian two storey terrace divided by pilasters into three houses. When constructed in , the terrace consisted of seven houses and was known as \\"Stafford Terrace\\". The external elevation of painted brick is essentially plain capped by a curved parapet, its only decoration being a carved flower in the centre, and have first floor balconies and open lower verandahs. Windows are double hung, while doors are mainly of four panels with a plain fanlight above, and with four pane french doors to the first floor verandah. (from Collingridge 1978) It is understood that only the facades of the terrace were retained when the Stafford Apartments were built. The street numbers in this part of Harrington Street have been changed, as the address of Tourism House to the north is now No 55, and that of the Stafford Apartments is No 75 Harrington Street, and the street numbers have been removed from the properties which were Nos 55-71 Harrington Street. Style: Victorian; Storeys: Two; Facade: Brick; Roof Cladding: Corrugated Iron (original). Archaeology is mostly intact. = Modifications and dates = *1986/87: The iron on the roofs was replaced by slate, thought to be the original roofing material. = Further information = Further research should be undertaken on the date of construction of the building and the extent of original fabric remaining. There is no evidence that the underfloor deposits have been disturbed, leaving a possible archaeological resource.

Arguably a member of the M√°laga School of Painting, he studied under Bernardo Ferr√°ndiz and alongside Moreno Carbonero. He moved to Italy in his early 20s, where he was further influenced by Italian and Spanish expatriate artists, and where he lived for the rest of his life. After his first visit to Venice in 1885, he specialized in landscape painting. He is widely known for the preciosity of his Venetian vedutas, the importance he places in the accurate depiction of architectural detail and his mastery of color. Among his most important works are his numerous views of the Venetian canals and Piazza San Marco, the classical scene Floralia (which disappeared during the Spanish Civil War) and Rancho Andaluz.  Early life and education  Born in the town of Co√≠n (M√°laga), he was one of ten children (six of which died in childhood) of Francisco Reyna Zayas (1825-1892) and Matilde Manescau y Otsman (1823-1910). His parents enjoyed a good social standing, being his uncle Jos√© Reyna Zayas mayor of Co√≠n while Antonio was a child. Being still a little boy Antonio showed a great ability for drawing. Although he continued living in Co√≠n for the rest of his childhood, he began his artistic training at the School of Fine Arts in Malaga, where he was taught by Joaqu√≠n Mart√≠nez de la Vega, first, and then by Bernardo Ferr√°ndiz, founder of the M√°laga School of Painting. He studied alongside future master Jos√© Moreno Carbonero, who was just a year older than him. From a young age he exhibited his works regularly, standing out in the local artistic environment for his use of colors, the attractiveness of his compositions and the agility of his brushwork. In 1880, at age 20, he sold his first important work for the town hall of Co√≠n.  Career  320x320px In 1882 he received a scholarship from the Provincial Council to further his art studies in Italy. He moved to Rome (where he was to live until his death), and in 1885 visited Venice; from that year on, Venetian landscapes, showing landmarks like the Grand Canal and Piazza San Marco but also less known quarters of the city, are ubiquitous in his work. Venice was at that time an artistic hub for Spanish painters, thanks in part to Fortuny's widow residing there, and also because of the Venetian production of Villegas Cordero and Mart√≠n Rico, whose preciosity in the depiction of the landscape was adopted by Reyna Manescau. Although his scholarship was supposed to finish in 1886, he was captivated by Italy and remained there. In Rome he frequently visited the workshop of Villegas Cordero, like so many other Spaniards, and under his influence he produced some oriental paintings. At the same time, as a member of the Spanish colony, he was a regular in tertulias in the Caf√© El Greco. In 1889 he married the opera singer Beatriz Mililotti Desantis, then 20, and settled to live in Rome. Canal in Venice. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. alt= Influenced by classical antiquity, by the mid 1880s he painted his lost masterwork Floralia, a classical scene that represents the annual festival celebrated in honor of the mythical goddess Flora and the arrival of spring. In order to achieve a meticulous representation of the ornaments and mosaics, he traveled to southern Italy to study the Pompeian wall paintings and the Farnese model of the Museum of Naples. In 1887 he sent the painting from Rome to Madrid, where it was exhibited at the National Exhibition of Fine Arts, obtaining a medal that earned him fame also in Spain. The painting was acquired by the Spanish State and sent to Barcelona, disappearing in the Civil War. Today this work is known just by old reproductions in the catalog of the 1887 exhibition and by a beautiful smaller working sketch that still survives. In 1895 Antonio, then 36 years of age, was already a recognized and awarded painter. That year, while his brother Ricardo was appointed mayor of Co√≠n, Antonio was invited by the Ateneo de Madrid board to decorate their headquarters. While in Madrid, the King of Spain, Alfonso XIII, made him a Knight of the Royal Order of Carlos III, the highest distinction awarded to a Spanish artist at that time. He also exported his work to London, where his Venetian views were exhibited several times. In Italy, his frequent exhibitions in Rome culminated with three of his paintings, entitled Roma sparita, being acquired by the fine arts museum of this city. As his fame consolidated, he painted two portraits of Pope Benedict XV, that entered the Vatican Museum, and regularly exhibited his production, traveling constantly in Italy. He worked for long periods in Assisi, where he visited the Benlliure brothers, of whom he was a friend, and also in Naples, where he studied the works of the Resina and Posillipo schools. Although in this stage he painted numerous realistic paintings, he still produced Venetian landscapes and vedutas, and views of the outskirts of Rome. On August 4, 1899, her only daughter, Mar√≠a Matilde, was born. His mother Matilde died in Co√≠n on September 7, 1910, and Antonio travelled to his hometown for her funeral. During his stay he painted a large canvas titled Rancho Andaluz, in which a family property known as 'Cortijo Ricardo' is masterfully represented.

Calderoni was the subject of various allegations of corruption.  Biography  Calderoni was born in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico in a well- off family. His father held an important post at Pemex, the state-owned petroleum company. His mother was Italian-American. Besides his native Spanish, he was fluent in English and French. In contrast to Spanish naming customs, he is often referred to by his mother's last name, rather than his father's‚Äîmore common‚Äîlast name. In the early 1980s, he enrolled as a federal officer on the United States-Mexico border and rose quickly to the rank of commander. Not everything was as it seemed: Calderoni expressed contempt for Americans and Drug Enforcement Administration agents, and admitted to smuggling cocaine across the border into El Paso, Texas. He was murdered on February 5, 2003, in McAllen, Texas.  In popular culture  In the 2018 Netflix drama, Narcos: Mexico, Calderoni is played by actor Julio Cesar Cedillo.

In 2014, life expectancy at birth was 74.1 years. In 1983 the infant mortality rate of 21.2 per 1,000 live births, rather better than other Eastern Caribbean islands. Healthcare The Ministry of Health is responsible for the provision of health services in Grenada, Carriacou and Petit Martinique. Nickolas Steele is the minister of health. There is a lot of emphasis on primary health care and preventative measures. Grenada does not have a national health insurance scheme at present but there is a compulsory National Insurance Scheme, which covers work-related injuries. Public spending on health was 3% of GDP in 2011, equivalent to US$479 per capita. In 2009, there were 98 doctors, and 398 nurses and midwives per 100,000 people. Primary health care services are generally free other than the cost of medicines, lab-work, or other diagnostics. The SpiceIsle Imaging Center is a private business, established in 2004, which provides scanning, mammography and ultrasound services. The New National Party (Grenada) proposed to introduce a National Health Insurance scheme in 2017. It would give citizens a card which would entitle them to use the services of SpiceIsle Imaging Center. Keith Mitchell promised in 2018 before the general election that implementation of the scheme would be a high priority. Technical support had been arranged by the University of the West Indies. Most pharmaceuticals are sourced through the Eastern Caribbean Drug Service. Facilities There are thirty medical stations, six health centers, and eight hospitals (four public and four private). Every household has a healthcare provider within three miles. The General Hospital in St. George‚Äôs is the premier facility. The closest mental health facility is at Mount Gay Hospital on Carriacou.

He is known for co-founding the comedy group, Culture Clash, with Richard Montoya, Herbert Siguenza and Jose Antonio Burciaga. He is currently working with the remaining two members, Herbert and Richard, on the production \\"Culture Clash (Still) in America\\". As of 2012, he resides in Los Angeles.  Early life  Salinas was born on May 31, 1960 in El Salvador. When he was a child his family moved to California and settled in the Mission District of San Francisco. Growing up in the inner city, Salinas was surrounded by gang violence and was shot trying to break up a fight. He went on to study communications at San Francisco State University, graduating first with a degree in broadcasting. Salinas then went on to get a second degree in speech communications. He describes his involvement in theater as an \\"accident\\". As a result he performed in theater productions throughout college and was a member of Teatro Latino. He also spent time breakdancing and rapping bilingually (in Spanish and English).  Career = Culture Clash = Culture Clash established the foundation for Salinas' career. Salinas told Philip Kan Gotanda, \\"Back then there weren't very many Salvadore√±os in the Mission District or in San Francisco, so I gravitated towards the Chicano movement,\\". He also says, \\"I was doing teatro and it was all kind of angry, political theatre -sometimes a little bit too dogmatic,\\". This interest in the Chicano/Latino experience combined with his involvement in theater and performing led to the meeting of the fellow members of Culture Clash (originally called Comedy Fiesta). The group formed with the aim of illuminating Latino experiences with humor and satire. = Solo career = Apart from Culture Clash, Salinas has acted in several plays and films, such as the 2014 play Placas: The Most Dangerous Tattoo by Paul S. Flores. The play follows the redemption of ex gang member, Fausto Carbajal, as he goes through the process of removing gang tattoos as well as fostering a relationship with his son. Salinas also starred in a one man show called '57 Chevy by Cris Franco (2015). It's a comedic play that follows the immigration of a family from Mexico to California, all in a '57 Chevy. Upon making the decision to do this play, Salinas says, \\"Another reason I decided to do this play is I got tired of all the immigrant bashing, insinuating there‚Äôs this sinister plot that immigrants are going to come here to destroy America. Cris‚Äôs play is an immigrant story that displays just how this country works at its best,\\". Salinas has been in several films and TV shows throughout his career. He has acted in the films Encino Man, Hero, Mi Vida Loca, Camera Obscura, The 3 Wise Men, Culture Clash in AmeriCCa, Larry Crowne, and Lola's Love Shack.

Modern address: Tver region, Likhoslavl district, village Pervitino, st. Sevastyanova, 31.  History  The Trinity Church with murals was erected in 1785-1794 at the expense of the owner of the Pervitino manor Alexander Fedorovich Shishkov. Consecrated in 1794. The architectural style combines elements of late baroque and classicism. The building is a longline type of church (octagon on quadrangle), the refectory is made in connection with the bell tower. A remarkable example of provincial architecture of the XVIII century. At the beginning of the 19th century, the Pervitino manor passed to the Khvostov family, which was closely related to the Shishkov family. Its first owner was the captain of artillery Nikolai Petrovich Khvostov. (1748-1829). He organized the purchase of new bells, as well as the construction of a stone fence around the Trinity Church.

When her mother and father leave for Japan, Marcia begs her governess to allow her to exchange places with the latter's niece and to go to an orphan asylum instead of the finishing school selected by her parents. The governess, solicitous for her niece's welfare, agrees, and Marcia becomes an \\"amateur orphan\\". After having a \\"lovely time\\" at the orphanage Marcia is adopted by a farmer's family. Into an atmosphere of gloom and misunderstanding Marcia brings her sunshiny spirit and straightens out many tangles. Then her parents return home unexpectedly and discover what has happened. Through an accident the record of Marcia's adoption is destroyed and her father offers a large reward for her discovery. Marcia's friend, Dave, the son of the family, thus wins a sufficient sum for an education. Years later Dave has become a young business man. He loves Marcia and asks her to marry him. She promises to do so only if he will give up a city career and return to the farm so that at last she may have the sort of life she wishes.

Faul introduced multiple new wrinkles into this chemistry, including using chiral copper(I) catalysts to produce enantiomerically- enriched aziridines, and using a variety of different nitrene sources for the transfer.  Research  Faul joined the process chemistry group at Eli Lilly in 1993, and joined Amgen's process group in 2003, rising eventually to its Executive Director. According to a biosketch at Organic Syntheses, Faul has expertise in Good Manufacturing Process scale-up of both chemical and biological therapeutics, and coordinates groups of external partners through licensing, regulatory, and program development issues. She attributes much of Amgen's success in this area to early adoption of new technologies, such as supercritical carbon dioxide purification and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (uPLC).  Volunteer work  Faul is an Editorial Board member at Thieme journal Science of Synthesis. She has served as the Chair of the Enabling Technologies Consortium.

It was built from 1860. It is also known as Sailors Return Hotel; Stafford Apts. and 75 Harrington Street; Clocktower Development. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The site, in 1807, was located to the west of the garden of the Colony's hospital. After the formation of Harrington Street a portion comprising 13 perches on the western side of the street was granted to a Claimant Thomas Weedon in November 1840. The site was allotment 8 in Section 79 as show on an 1835 survey. Weedon continued as landlord until a date between 1867 and 1871, when Frederick Oatley purchased the property. The 1835 survey map shows an L-shaped building located in the northern half of the site together with a substantial structure to the south. In 1845 the City Council assessed the northern section of the site as containing a two-room stone house with shingled roof. The two room stone house appears in the Rate Assessment books, described as a \\"very old building\\", until 1882, when no entry is recorded at this address. The 1891 rate assessment notes Oatley and Cahill as the owners of the site. Oatley remained the owner until , when E. B. McKenny became proprietor. The site appears to have remained vacant until , when a building, rated as a two-storey house, was constructed for E. B. McKenny. The house first appeared in the 1898 Sands Directory, when it was known as 33 Harrington Street. It was rated as a shop, and was occupied by a George Jones. The numbering changed to 71 Harrington Street in 1924. In December 1900 Harrington Street was resumed by the NSW Government as part of Section 8 Observatory Hill lands, component of section 79 City of Sydney. Entries in various Sands Directories indicate that George Jones operated a lodging house at 33 Harrington Street between 1903 and 1918. In 1919 and 1920 Mrs Mary Jones managed the establishment. In the 1920s and 30s there was a large turnover of tenants in the building, tenants paying per week in the 1920s and per week in the 1930s. SCA tenancy records provide evidence of the everyday existential problems of tenants, noting endless rental arrears and requests for rental reduction or transfer to cheaper premises. In February 1937 George Henry Johnson signed the tenancy contract for the premises. Johnson and his family remained tenant at 71 Harrington Street until 1973, paying per week in 1937, in 1957 and $20 in 1973. Sydney Cove Authority records note rental arrears and indebtedness of G. H. Johnson a number of times during the 36 years of his tenancy. Tenancy records note a number of smaller repair and improvement and the tenant's request \\"to have the hall and kitchen renovated\\" and \\"to have gas store connected\\" (1944). In 1946 Johnson asked the \\"Board to build verandah or porch\\" and applied \\"for a new entrance be made from the residence to Harrington Street\\". The tenant's request for renovation and repairs indicate that in the 1960s the building was in a run-down condition. The building was vacant for at least ten years then in the late-1980s it was redeveloped as part of the Clock Tower development. During the redevelopment of the block in the 1980s the rear section of the house at 71 Harrington Street was demolished. The 1986 plan below indicates that half of the rear portion and the chimney stack were removed and a single brick wall built at the western end of the house. Some of the existing internal walls were removed, two doorways were bricked up and new doors and a window were fitted into existing walls at both levels. The architectural character of the street fa√ßade and the general roof form together with the noteworthy chimney were retained, but the original house lost its size, mass and form, with much of its original fabric modified. The refurbishment involved the re-roofing of the buildings, replacement of floors and replacement of original features such as fireplaces, doors and windows with sympathetic replicated elements. While the house was modified, it generally still presents as intact when viewed from Harrington Street.  Description  71 Harrington Street was constructed . Originally rated as a \\"shop\\" it later became a \\"lodging house\\" and, finally, a house. As far it is known the original roof was of corrugated iron. Storeys: Two; Facade: Brick and render; Roof Cladding: Iron. = Condition = As at 27 April 2001, Archaeology Assessment Condition: Partly disturbed. Assessment Basis: Area under building only. Terraced into hill slope. = Modifications and dates = *1986/87: The facade of the building was restored as part of the Clocktower development. The iron on the roof was replaced.  Heritage listing  As at 30 March 2011, this house and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The site has historical significance as part of the Colony's hospital site in 1807, and the building as part of the 19th century housing stock in The Rocks. It has aesthetic significance as part of a strong visual precinct of buildings with Nos. 55-69 and Nos. 42-52 and the Harbour Rocks Hotel on the other side of the street, and with the buildings at 39-47 Argyle Street. Originally built in the 1890s, the house at 71 Harrington Street provided accommodation for the lower middle and working classes in residence in The Rocks until the mid-1970s. In the late-1980s the rear section of the house was demolished and the retained portion became incorporated into the serviced apartment building of the Clock Tower development. The building lost its identity and ability to demonstrate its original configuration and use. The retained street section, however, enhances the human scale of the streetscape. Together with the adjacent terraces it forms a strong visual precinct, contributing to the characteristic Rocks townscape. House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Originally built in the 1890s, the house at 71 Harrington Street provided accommodation of the lower middle and working classes in residence in The Rocks until the mid-1970s The remaining portion of the house at 71 Harrington Street has historic significance as part of the 19th century housing stock in The Rocks.

She gathered six million signatures on a petition and, in 1913, was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. The outbreak of the First World War interrupted her plans but her ideas influenced the Kellogg‚ÄìBriand Pact of 1928.  Early life  Eckstein was born on 14 June 1868 in Coburg to Johann Nikolaus Eckstein and Anna Barbara Eckstein, n√©e G√∂tz. Her father was a porter and assistant telegraphist at the ', a railway company. Eckstein had a younger brother named Ernst and an older sister named Antonie (Toni), who was born with a disability. Financial reasons limited her formal education to attending a girl's school from 1874 to 1882. However, Eckstein's teacher Ottilie Frese supported her in learning English and French, which made her want to become a teacher herself. She was confirmed in the main church of Coburg in 1882. At the age of 16, in September 1884, Eckstein left Germany to visit relatives in New York. The reasons for this are unclear. Her parents might have wanted to prevent her from forming a relationship with an aristocrat who was out of her range, or it was to support her teaching career. For the first few years she worked as a maid or teacher at various places and then took on a job as a private teacher for the daughter (Mamie) of a Jewish merchant (Godfrey Mannheimer) who had immigrated from Germany. While working in this household from December 1887 to October 1893 she joined the Mannheimer family on three trips to Germany.  Peace activism  Dressed in white in Vienna in 1911 Eckstein moved to Boston in 1894, at first living with the novelist Martha \\"Mattie\\" Griffith Browne and still working as a teacher. In response to her disappointment at the outcomes of the Hague Conventions she joined the American Peace Society, of which she became vice president between 1905 and 1911. She collected over one million signatures, signed by supporters from the US, UK, and Germany, for a proposal she had written prior to the second peace conference in The Hague. On 4 July 1907 she handed this document to the chairman of the conference. Since Eckstein did not see the treaties of this second conference as a success, she organised her own version funded by her own money. She went on to collect six million signatures which she planned to present at the third Hague peace conference in 1914 but the outbreak of the First World War prevented this. This setback caused her to suffer a breakdown but her ideas eventually influenced the Kellogg‚ÄìBriand Pact of 1928. With the support of the American publisher Edwin Ginn, Eckstein travelled through Canada and Europe to promote her ideas. In 1909, Eckstein attended the second National Peace Congress in Chicago, USA, where she read a \\"World Petition to the Third Hague Conference\\". The same year, she moved back to her birthplace Coburg. From there she continued to travel to most European countries, and also Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and China, where she gained increasing support for her cause. She used to wear white dresses as a symbol of peace. Amongst others, Eckstein worked with Bertha von Suttner, Alfred Hermann Fried, Ludwig Quidde, and Jean Jaur√®s. Especially in France and Germany she also had to deal with opposition and criticism, but was nevertheless nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1913.  World War I  During the First World War, Eckstein wrote articles for a magazine on international law, whose editor was the German expert for international law, Theodor Niemeyer. She also published the book Staatenschutzvertrag zur Sicherung des Weltfriedens (State Protection Treaty to Preserve World Peace).  Later life and death  Plaque in Coburg After the end of World War I Eckstein worked with the Deutsche Liga f√ºr den V√∂lkerbund (German League of Nations) and set up regional groups of it, including in her home town Coburg. There she was very active in trying to keep the rise of National Socialism at bay. Eckstein also helped establishing a local society of the German Democratic Party, an adult education centre, a community club, and a society for literature and music. In addition to that, Eckstein was active in the Protestant church, and was a member of the state synod. Eckstein stayed in Switzerland from March to September 1933, and then returned to Coburg. In order to maintain awareness of the Kellogg‚ÄìBriand Pact, she continued writing letters, and in 1942, she attempted to publish a manuscript titled \\"The Will to Power Harmonized\\", but the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, under Goebbels, denied her permission. She died on 16 October 1947 at her home in Coburg.  Legacy  The city of Coburg honoured Eckstein and her accomplishments by naming a green space after her in 1987. In 2013 a primary school in Meeder was renamed to Anna-B.-Eckstein-Schule. The school has a peace museum on the ground floor and a room dedicated to the life of Anna Eckstein.

In May 1189, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa began his expedition to the Holy Land as part of the Third Crusade to recover the city of Jerusalem from the forces of Saladin. After an extended stay in the European territories of the Byzantine Empire, the Imperial army crossed over to Asia at the Dardanelles from 22‚Äì28 March 1190. After surmounting opposition from Byzantine populations and Turkish irregulars, the Crusader army was surprised in camp by a 10,000-man Turkish force of the Sultanate of R√ªm near Philomelion on the evening of 7 May. The Crusader army counterattacked with 2,000 infantry and cavalry under the leadership of Frederick VI, Duke of Swabia and Berthold, Duke of Merania, putting the Turks to flight and killing 4,174‚Äì5,000 of them. Background Pope Gregory VIII called for a crusade to restore the city of Jerusalem to Christian hands after its loss to Saladin in 1187 and to help the remaining crusader strongholds in the Holy Land. Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, a veteran of the Second Crusade, took up the Cross at the Curia Christi (court of Christ) in Mainz Cathedral on 27 March 1188 and was the first to set out for the Holy Land in May 1189 with an army of 12,000‚Äì15,000 men, including 4,000 knights. After marching through Hungary, Serbia, Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire, the Imperial army crossed over the Dardanelles to Anatolia by 28 March 1190. The Anatolian plateau was held by the Seljuk Sultanate of R√ªm. The passage of the Crusader army provoked armed resistance from the local Byzantine populations in Anatolia. The Crusaders' horses suffered from a lack of grasslands. Having secured in advance Turkish promises of safe transit and the preparation of markets for the Crusader army, Frederick's troops were surprised by hit-and-run Turkish attacks on them upon entering Turkish territory. A Turkish attack on the Imperial camp was defeated on 30 April, with 500 Turks killed. On 2 May, the Crusaders defeated another Turkish attack and killed 300 Turks. The next day, the Imperial soldiers were ambushed by the Turks and hit with arrows and rocks. A knight named Werner was killed while Frederick VI, Duke of Swabia was wounded along with nine other knights. The Crusaders climbed up a mountain to reach the ambushers and killed sixty of them. They then proceeded to massacre Turkish women and small children in a fertile lowland area. The Minnes√§nger Friedrich von Hausen died on 6 May. He accidentally fell from his horse while pursuing fleeing Turkish troops. Battle The Crusaders camped near the city of Philomelion on 7 May. The Turks believed the Imperials to be completely exhausted from hunger and attacked the camp with 10,000 cavalry and infantry in the evening. The attack was accompanied by missile fire and stones. The Crusader army sallied forth from the camp with 2,000 men, with the infantry followed by the cavalry. The Crusaders were led by Frederick VI, Duke of Swabia and Berthold, Duke of Merania. The Turks were completely routed and the survivors were saved only by nightfall and the mountainous terrain. Aftermath The Crusaders passed Philomelion on 8 May, their ranks thinned by hunger. Turkish attacks continued. On 9‚Äì10 May, the Crusaders killed 64 Turkish soldiers and on 11 May about 250 Turks, mostly horse archers, were added to the score. On 12 May, the Crusaders crossed a narrow bridge that left them highly vulnerable, but the Turks interfered only minimally, with 20 Turks slain that day. The crusaders continued their march until they reached the Seljuk capital city of Iconium on 13 May, where a major battle would be fought on 18 May. =Casualties= The Turks lost 4,174 killed according to the Turks' own body count of their fallen later on. The bodies of another 600 dead could not be recovered. A Crusader estimate put the Turkish death toll at 5,000.

Career Mme Acquaire was known under the name Mlle Babet in her early career. During the 1770s, she was active as an actress and director in Petit-Goave. Petit-Goave did not possess an actual theatre, but theatrical and musical performances was immensely popular in Saint-Domingue and an important part of the colony's social life, and theatrical and musical performances was staged by local amateurs assisted by professional actors. Babet functioned as the professional director and instructor of the performances at Petit-Goave, an unusual position for a woman.John G. Cale, French Secular Music in Saint-Domingue (1750-1795) Viewed as a Factor in America's Musical Growth, Louisiana State University and Agricultural & Mechanical College, 1971 In Saint-Domingue, however, several women are known for their influence within the theatre world, such as Mlle Marthe, director of the theatre of St Marc (1769), and Madame Case, co-director with her spouse of the theatre in Les Cayes (1785). On June 18, 1777, the Affiches Americaines announced that Beaumarchais' Barbier de Sevilla and l'Braeur d'un moment, a one-act opera by Monvel, would be performed to the benefit of Mlle Babet, staged by the local amateur theatre society, prior to her departure from her position as director after her marriage to the actor 'Monsieur Acquaire', with whom she was engaged at the Com√©die de Port-au-Prince after its foundation in 1778. Madame Acquaire came to have an influential position in the theatre of the colonial capital, where her spouse eventually became director (1784). She belonged to the star attractions of the theatre and performed as a singer as well as an actress in both theatre and opera, playing roles within the category of tragic heroines, a category with high status in that period. She wielded an important influence within cultural life in Saint-Domingue, and played a significant part in introducing colored actors on stage in colonial theatre by recruiting colored actors to the theatre. She is known for having recruited the colored Minette et Lise, who she gave lessons in voice and stage presence and successfully introduced to the stage in 1780. Mme Acquaire left Saint-Domingue for France in 1786, and was joined by her spouse five years later, after the outbreak of the Haitian Revolution of 1791.

Early life and education  She was born Margaret Petrie, in London on 27 March 1922. Her mother was a teacher and her father was a manufacturer and printer. She studied at the City of London School for Girls. She graduated from the London School of Economics in 1943 with a first class honours degree in Sociology.  Career  She was a leading figure in establishing sociology as an academic discipline, helping shape British empirical sociology. She was one of the creators of medical sociology as a distinct academic field. She was a key contributor to the reconceptualisation of medicine as a healing system in a wider societal context, rather than simply concerned with the interactions in the clinic; a 'sociology of health and healing', rather than 'medical sociology'. Her work in the sociology of health and healing has influenced policy and medical education. After graduating from LSE in 1943, she worked in a war factory in Scotland. At this time, she campaigned against the imprisonment of immigrants from enemy nations, influenced by her encounters with her fellow student at LSE, Claus Moser. She left this job after a year, to work as an extramural lecturer in Oxford. After ten years without a secure position in a university, during which time she nevertheless continued to work, she started working at Swansea University in 1961, and was appointed a lecturer in 1963. In the 1960s, Stacey led the influential research project Children in Hospital, funded by the Ministry of Health. At the time, when a child was admitted to hospital, the sole objective was to treat the illness, leading some children to be separated from their families, friends and schools for many months and ignoring the wider wellbeing of the child. She moved to the University of Warwick in 1974; the first woman to be appointed to a professorship at the university. She held this role until her retirement in 1989. During this time, she published 14 books, and served as chair of the sociology department and the graduate school of Women's Studies. Her first book, Tradition and Change (1960), was the first British study of social change to have a follow up study. It examined social change in Banbury, Oxfordshire in the 1940s, and was pioneering for its use of team research. From 1968 to 1970 Stacey served as Secretary of the British Sociological Association. She was elected President of the British Sociological Association in 1982, and her presidential address criticised the male-dominated field and its influence on the primarily male subjects of study. She was appointed to the Welsh Hospital Board in 1970, and she was a member-observer of the General Medical Council from 1973 to 1983. In 1999 a conference was convened in her honour, hosted at the University of Warwick. In the same year, she travelled to Montenegro to work with Women in Black, a women's anti-war movement. She was a feminist and actively worked to improve gender balance in academia, often mentoring and supporting younger women colleagues.  Personal life  She was widely known as Meg, retaining the name Margaret for professional purposes. She married political scientist Frank Stacey in 1945, and the couple had four children and a foster child. Stacey completed her husband's book, Ombudsmen Compared, which was unfinished when he died in 1977. She lived with her partner Jennifer Lorch for many years. Stacey enjoyed gardening, and in later life became interested in Buddhism. She died in Warwick on 10 February 2004.

Marthe was originally engaged as an actress an singer at the Com√©die du Cap in Cap-Francais, which was founded in 1764. The name of Mlle Marthe is associated with the foundation of theatre in Saint- Marc. That city was at the time the second largest city of Saint-Domingue, which was known for its great theatrical interest. In 1767, the first theatre play was staged in a temporary barracks hall at Saint-Marc by the actors Charron and Goulart from Com√©die du Cap, and a permanent playhouse with 400 seats was built. A Monsieur Duval was originally named director for the Com√©die de Saint-Marc, but Marthe bought the concession and took the position of director of the theatre herself. She managed the theatre in association with a female assistant and co-director, the actress Mlle Francheville. This business arrangement was unique,John G. Cale, French Secular Music in Saint- Domingue (1750-1795) Viewed as a Factor in America's Musical Growth, Louisiana State University and Agricultural & Mechanical College, 1971 but several women were to become known for their influence within the theatre world in Saint- Domingue, such as Madame Acquaire, director of the theatre of Petit-Gouave (1770s), and Madame Case, co-director with her spouse of the theatre in Les Cayes (1785). The 1770 Port-au-Prince earthquake razed the theatre to the ground during a performance of Rousseau's le Devin du Village. Marthe's sponsors immediately financed the building of a new playhouse, and in the meantime the directors continued to schedule the comedies and light operas in a large tent. The new Com√©die de Saint-Marc was inaugurated in 1773, with 500 seats ninety feet in length, fifty feet in width, with two ranks of loges (it was burned by order of Jean-Jacques Dessalines in 1802). She performed in the operas L'Ami de la maison by Gretry (1778), La Fee Urgele by Duni (1781), Les trois Fermiers by Monvel-Dezede, and a concert at the Com√©die de Port-au- Prince in 1783.

Life and career  Jenny Nijenhuis was born in Johannesburg, South Africa and in 1993 received her Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of the Witwatersrand. In 2014 she was selected as finalist for the Lovell Tranyr Art Trophy. She was selected as finalist for the PPC Imaginarium art award in 2015, and finalist for the Sasol New Signatures art competition in 2017. Between 2005 - 2018 she ran Genealogy Brand DNA, an integrated communications design agency. Her works can be found in private and public art collections such as the August House in Johannesburg, and the Paul Stuart private collection. Nijenhuis was invited by the Cornell University International Students Union (ISU) to give the keynote address at a university-wide event being hosted on the 7th of March 2019. She has been asked to introduce the work she is doing as an advocate for women's rights.  Public installations  In 2016 Nijenhuis devised SA's Dirty Laundry public installation together with performance artist Nondumiso Msimanga. The installation consisted of 1,200 meters of washing lines displaying 3,600 pairs of underwear, which according to the Medical Research Council, matches the number of rapes estimated to occur on a daily basis in South Africa. The panties were hung in the streets of Johannesburg for two weeks to denounce sexual abuse and rape. In an interview with BBC News Africa Nijenhuis explained that she used underwear because it is the most intimate garment people wear, and it is also the last garment removed during a rape. From her point of view the use of this intimate garment carries a much stronger, and personal message symbolically. SA's Dirty Laundry has received major international coverage. The installation has been featured by The Guardian, Marie Claire, Upworthy, as well as on Italian, Spanish, German, Turkish and Chinese media, among others. Amnesty International South Africa contributed to the realization of the project by providing the financial resources needed for the construction of the installation. Nijenhuis and Msimanga have been criticized for using the Medical Research Council statistic, as the United Nations estimates that 132 rapes are committed in South Africa each day. The artists responded by pointing out that all attempts to quantify sexual assault in South Africa are flawed, and that the majority of incidents are not reported by victims. In November 2019 Nijenhuis presented This is South Africa, a large South African flag made out of panties and underwear that were donated by rape survivors to her SA's Dirty Laundry installation in 2016. The flag is hung upside down as a signal of distress in accordance with the international communication protocols. The flag was hung at the SA High Commission in London to coincide with a protest against gender violence.  Sculptures  Nijenhuis's sculpture explores identity archetypes and human positioning in the world through the use of the human body. This exploration draws on identity development and how this identity is influenced by life in society. Certain concepts behind her sculpture works are influenced by psychoanalyst Carl Jung. Nijenhuis models directly in clay to produce life size figures to achieve real world presence through their human scale and other smaller works using trace elements to explore presence through installation. Nijenhuis's work addresses issues of isolation, vulnerability, manipulation, gender and the female experience.

Originally, theatre companies from France performed in temporary localities on tours to Martinique. From 1780, there where demands to the authorities to provide the colony with a permanent theatre. At that point, there where already theatres in the cities of Saint- Domingue since the 1760s and two in Guadeloupe (in Basse-Terre and Pointe-a- Pitre), and a theatre was considered to be an essential hall mark of civilisation and sophistication. The building was designed inspired by the famous Theatre of Bordeaux, and had room for 800 seats. The theatre was described as extremely elaborate and elegant, and became famous in the Caribbean. In the facility, the latest drama, opera and ballets where performed by artists from France. The artists typically stayed no more than a few years or temporary until they continued to Saint-Domingue.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at: http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=599034 on 2018-11-19 Description The length of the shell attains 5.8 mm, its diameter 2.42 mm. (Original description) The small, fusiform, fragile shell shows shouldered whorls. The body whorl is slightly shorter than the spire and ends in a rather short open siphonal canal. The sculpture consists of longitudinal and spiral threads and riblets, the former inclined slightly backward. They number about fifteen on the penultimate whorl and are obsolete above the angle, absent upon the greater part of the body whorl. The spirals consist of five minute threads on the slope above the angle. Beneath the latter there are four much stronger riblets, forming gemmules at the intersections of the longitudinals. The body whorl contains about twenty-three spirals, those upon the base and neck more widely spaced, but equally slender as those on the shoulder. The colour of the shell is light-cream. The spire is turriculate-conical, with a blunt apex. The protoconch is slightly bulbose, with about two smooth whorls, nucleus globular. The shell contains 5 whorls, angled at the periphery, straight above, slightly convex below. The base is convex, then contracted and ending in a short distally rounded beak. The suture is deep. The aperture is pyriform, broadly angled above, ending in a rather short almost straight siphonal canal, slightly turned to the left. The outer lip is imperfect, convex above, contracted near the base. It is evident from the growthlines that the sinus is broad, rounded, and moderately deep, extending almost from the suture to the keel. The inner lip forms a thin and narrow callosity on the almost straight columella, which is slightly twisted at the base.R Murdoch, H Suter Results of dredging on the continental shelf of New Zealand.

She would continue to learn from her father for another 13 years. = Chinese Cultural Revolution = The Chinese Cultural Revolution, which began during Tsu Weiling's childhood, restricted all permitted music to eight Peking operas approved by Jiang Qing, the wife of Mao Zedong. Since the classical music that Tsu Weiling was taught was banned, she was forced to hide her violin practices, often in basements. She describes this period of her life and the fear of prosecution: > \\"We had a basement, actually, a very small room, and I practiced very > secretively. You had to draw the curtain and play in a dark room, using a > mute. You could not let people see you practice, because they called it > 'unhealthy music.' We had seven or eight 'red songs' from Peking Opera, and > they were all that was played. That was the only kind of music that people > were allowed to hear.\\" Tsu Weiling also relied on music scores smuggled in from visiting Soviet Union musicians, which were then hand copied using pencil and passed to her, often with wrong notes or rhythms due to the copying process. Among the banned scores they were able to copy were etudes by Schradieck, Sevcik, Kreutzer, and Dancla. However, since concertos were so rare to find, Tsu Weiling had not even heard of Mendelssohn's Concerto until it was secretly copied. She comments that \\"...this is how we learned, with no recordings, nothing. No model we could learn from. It was very difficult situation during the Cultural Revolution.\\" Around Tsu Weiling's sophomore year in high school, circa 1976, The Gang of Four, who had controlled the cultural and educational systems in China by enforcing the ideals of the Cultural Revolution, collapsed. This allowed her to audition for the Central Conservatory of Music after schools and universities were re-opened to college students, following a ban spanning ten years being lifted.  Career  Tsu Weiling began her studies at the Central Conservatory in Beijing in 1977 as part of the first generation of college students post-Cultural Revolution. During her second year of college in 1979, Tsu Weiling performed in front of violin master Isaac Stern when he visited China. She was subsequently featured in the documentary From Mao to Mozart: Isaac Stern in China, directed by Murray Lerner, which details Stern's visit and his experiences being the first American musician to collaborate with the Chinese orchestra. She can be seen playing an excerpt from Caprice after a study in the form of a waltz by Saint-Saens, arranged by Ysa√øe. The documentary won an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 1981. Tsu Weiling describes meeting Stern as \\"revolutionary. Like a tornado,\\", and upon hearing him play, she comments, \\"it was like being in the desert for so long, and then all of a sudden -- water! A fountain!\\". The meeting inspired her to pursue studies abroad. During filming, Tsu Weiling met violinist and conductor Yehudi Menuhin who sponsored her to study in Switzerland. In 1980 Tsu Weiling travelled to America where she first studied at the Peabody Conservatory with Daniel Heifetz. She then enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music to be mentored by Dorothy DeLay, where she remained for three years until she transferred to the Manhatton School of Music to study with Raphael Bronstein. In 1981 she won first place at the Manoque International Young Artist Competition, and would soon after win the Waldo Mayo Talent Award and the Artists International Competition. In 1984 Tsu Weiling had her debut recital at Carnegie Hall, and in 1988 she performed at Avery Fisher Hall with the New York Symphony Orchestra, becoming the first violinist from the Chinese mainland to perform as a soloist at both venues. Between 1993‚Äì2000, Tsu Weiling held the position of First Associate Concertmaster of the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra where her husband, maestro Long Yu, was guest conductor. Tsu Weiling holds two professorships; one from the Central Conservatory in Beijing in November 2000, and the other awarded by The Shanghai Conservatory in September 2014. In 2009 Tsu Weiling created the China Trio with pianist Sheng Yuan and cellist Zhu Yibing. One of the main reasons for forming the trio is to provide the Chinese public an opportunity to listen to chamber music, which has a more intimate experience than orchestral concerts due to the much smaller number of players performing, in this case, three. To explain a lack of chamber music presence in China, Tsu Weiling cites pressures for soloists to focus on their solo careers rather than divert time towards small group performances, \\"I founded The China Trio with two like- minded musicians to fill a vacancy for professional chamber music in China\\". The China Trio performed at the Shanghai Music in the Summer Air Festival in 2016. In 2016, Tsu Weiling and her husband, conductor Long Yu, honoured Isaac Stern by launching The Shanghai Isaac Stern International Violin Competition; the first ever international competition in her hometown. Tsu Weiling served as a judge for this competition. In an interview, she expressed the cultural and political significance of Shanghai hosting such a violinist competition: > \\"Before, I couldn't even dream of all these people in my own city, and also > being a judge in an international-level competition,\\" she said. \\"We were so > isolated in China: no music, no recordings, no live performance, no idea > what real music is. And now, we have our own competition, bringing so many > great musicians together in this city. This changes things tremendously.\\" She is married to a conductor, Long Yu and they have one daughter. = Teaching style = Tsu Weiling teaches violin at the Central Conservatory in Beijing, the Shanghai Conservatory, as well as a masterclass in Mozart's violin sonata no. 27 in G-major, K379 at the iClassical Academy. The masterclass entails analysis of the composition by Tsu Weiling to provide detailed notes on bow distribution, stylistic pauses between notes to underline the sound, and attention to the conversational flow between piano and violin. In an interview with The Strad, Tsu Weiling describes her approach to performing as a soloist among an orchestra, stating that one should learn the entire score as well as the solo part so they can perform with confidence, \\"the more prepared you are, the more room you have to adjust.\\" She also states that being afraid of playing wrong notes or forgetting parts hinders soloists, causing them to \\"play like machines\\" by not making eye contact with the conductor and orchestra. > \\"A performance should be a conversation between the soloist, the conductor > and the orchestra; at the same time you have to communicate with the > audience. Music should connect, no matter what, through slow notes, long > notes, melodic passages, fast passages ‚Äì even when you have an eight-bar > rest while the orchestra plays.\\" Among Tsu Weiling's pupils are Renchao Yu (2018 Zarin Mehta Fellow), Angela Chan, and Strauss Shi. Tsu Weiling is vocal about the need to continuously improve and credits the opportunities she was given for her achievements, \\"For me, the most disturbing problem at present is not the technical difficulties, but the most basic skills that we gain learning violin at the very beginning...It's more like a feeling and hard to explain but I enjoy, above anything else, the moment when I can extend a beautiful note and let it breathe. I am lucky to have so many great opportunities - and I took them...I will play my violin as long as I can.\\"  Jury positions  Tsu Weiling regularly serves as a jury member on a number of notable violin competitions which can provide prize winners with funds and in some cases, loans of valuable instruments such as Stradivarius violins. She credits the opportunity of judging these competitions for improving her own teaching style and solo performances.

Lanada Sr. (born August 1939) is a Filipino martial artist, founder and highest-ranking member of Kuntaw ng Pilipinas and International Kuntaw Federation (10th degree red belt), and author. Biography Great Grandmaster Carlito A. Lanada Sr. (La√±ada in the Philippines) was born in Naga City of the Bicol region of Luzon Island in the Philippines in 1939. He is the son of Yong Iban Lanada, whose father Yuyong Huenyo came from the Tausog Tribe in the southern Muslim island of Mindanao. He was taught by both his Grandfather and his Father in the art of Kuntaw back in Mindanao and was passed down within the Muslim royal families. Great-Great Grandmaster was one of the sons of Rajah in the Tausog tribe. He decided to find his fortune in the northern Philippines. After forming his organization of Kung Fu-Karate Organization of the Philippines and formalizing the training of Kuntaw, he went on to train many champions. Kuntaw (meaning \\"sacred strike'or 'fist way') is the modern version of Kuntao in the Philippines as developed, taught, and propagated by Great Grandmaster Carlito A. Lanada, Sr. Kuntaw is an eclectic art encompassing hard/soft techniques with elements that show the influence of Karate and Kung-fu styles and cat-like movements, with 43 distinctive forms, 86 basics, and Arnis as its weapon of choice.GGM Carlito A. Lanada, Kuntaw, the ancient Pilipino Martial Arts, Paperback ‚Äì 1995 In 1966 the Great Grandmaster was rewarded by his peers the title of ‚ÄúYoungest Filipino Martial Art Founder‚Äù. In 1968 his organization became a founding member of the World Union of Karate-Do Organizations (WUKO), and in 1970 he became one of the founding members of the Philippine Karate Association (PKA). He changed the name of his organization to Maharlika Kuntaw Association, honoring the Filipino Muslim royalties from which Kuntaw originated. In 1974, he changed the name to Kuntaw Ng Pilipinas following his award for work in the Filipino Martial Arts by then President Ferdinand Marcos, thus completing the formalization of Kuntaw as a Filipino national art. Constantly working to perfect his art, he is known to periodically upgrade and realign his forms and instructions across all affiliated schools. Due to this, the training style may differ slightly based on when you learned Kuntaw (although, much of the original forms and methods still remain). This resulted in the development of Kuntaw Lima-Lima, translated as the art of five sacred strikes. With the closeness to the U.S. Naval Base, he trained many Americans and other foreigners, as well to many Filipinos who migrated to other countries. These Kuntawista's went to countries such as America, Saudi Arabia, Japan, England, Canada, United Arab Emirates, and others to establish schools of their own. In 1979, he held the inauguration of the International Kuntaw Federation (I.K.F.), thereby uniting all members of Kuntaw worldwide. To date, the Kuntaw Temple in Olongapo City is being cared for and run by his eldest son, Grandmaster Carlito G. Lanada Jr. The Great Grandmaster Carlito A. Lanada Sr. has moved to the United States with most of his family. Within few years of residing in the United States, he garnered the highest award by being a recipient of the Presidential Sports Award as a Martial Arts Grandmaster in 1993. The Great Grandmaster completed his book ‚ÄúKUNTAW ‚Äì The Ancient Filipino Martial Arts‚Äù in January 1995 and commenced the compilation of an advanced book on Kuntaw. In 1996, he was inducted into the International Karate Hall of Fame and the Martial Arts Museum of America. In 1997, he founded a new worldwide organization ‚Äì World Unified Council of Martial Arts (WUCMA), with five other Grandmasters. Kuntaw has come to age, from obscurity to international renown. Grandmaster Lanada is the 2002 Filipino Martial Arts Magazines Who's Who Man of the Year! In 2008, GGM Lanada traveled to Canada, where he was inducted into the North American Martial Arts Hall of Fame. In June 2010, Lanada was inducted into the Masters Hall of Fame in Anaheim, California. There he was also awarded their Highest honor- the Platinum Lifetime Achievement Award. GGM Carlito A. Lanada Sr. is currently residing in North Carolina.

Lanada, Sr."},{"id":"59103038","text":"Psychological inertia is the tendency to maintain the status-quo (or default option) unless compelled by a psychological motive to intervene or reject this. Psychological inertia is similar to the status-quo bias but there is an important distinction in that psychological inertia involves inhibiting any action, whereas the status-quo bias involves avoiding any change which would be perceived as a loss. Research into psychological inertia is limited, particularly into its causes, but it has been seen to affect decision-making by causing individuals to automatically choose or prefer the default option, even if there is a more beneficial option available to them, unless motivated to reject this option. For example, psychological inertia may cause individuals to continue with their investments later than they should, despite information telling them otherwise, causing them to suffer greater losses than they would have if they had disinvested earlier. Psychological inertia has also seen to be relevant in areas of health, crime and within the workplace.  Loss aversion vs psychological inertia  David Gal and Derek Rucker both suggest that psychological inertia could be a more suitable explanation for phenomena such as the status-quo bias and the endowment effect than loss aversion. = Status quo bias = The psychological inertia account asserts that the reason individuals choose to remain at the status quo is due to a lack of psychological motive to change this behaviour rather than through the weighing up of losses and gains in this decision. Both explanations were tested by David Gal in a study where subjects were asked to imagine that they owned a quarter minted in either Denver or Philadelphia. They were then given the choice of exchanging their coin with one minted in the other city, assuming insignificant time and effort involved in this process. It was found that 85% of participants chose to retain their original coin which can be explained by the inertia account of remaining at the status quo. However, the loss aversion account is unable to explain this decision as it does not provide insight into a propensity towards the status-quo when the option values are equivalent. = Endowment effect = The endowment effect, i.e. greater value being placed on objects that are owned than those that are not, has been shown to be caused by loss aversion. This was demonstrated in Daniel Kahneman's study in 1990 where participants who were given a mug demanded, on average, around seven dollars to part with it. Whereas, individuals who were not given a mug were only willing to spend, on average, around three dollars on the same mug. This therefore demonstrated that losses exert a greater impact than gains. However, it could also be seen as evidence for psychological inertia as the participants were provided with the same objects and therefore, as they were indifferent to them, they chose to maintain the status quo as there was no incentive to trade. Inability to break with tradition The 1998 article \\"Psychological Inertia\\" by James Kowalick refers to a company where the president was displeased that company management had little knowledge of what was going on in the manufacturing department. The management team was not approachable and looked down on employees that were not managers. \\"Remaining behind the sacred doors of one's managerial office had become quite a tradition.\\" To address this issue, the president asked each manager to present a manufacturing procedure in detail at the staff meeting, having the other managers asking, penetrating questions. As a result, in short time, managers were on the production floor learning the procedures. This form of PI represents \\"cultural and traditional programming\\".  Examples and applications = Health = Avolition has been understood as a core symptom in schizophrenia, however, the drivers of it are unclear. One possible driver that many underlie avolition is psychological inertia. It has been argued that as individuals with schizophrenia may be less able to convert their preferences into actions, they may display an increased tendency to maintain a current state, even if they attribute greater value to a different option available. Therefore, this causes these individuals to display greater levels of psychological inertia, and since this process inhibits their action, its presence could drive avolition. James Gold found that motivational impairments of schizophrenia may be associated with abnormalities in estimating the \\"cost\\" of effortful behaviour leading to increased psychological inertia which, in turn, could lead to increased avolition in these individuals. However, research into links between psychological inertia and schizophrenia is limited as is their relationship to avolition. For example, research is needed to explore whether the differences in levels of psychological inertia in individuals with schizophrenia only occur when there is a need to engage high levels of inertia or when the individual displays a high level of avolition. Research has shown, however, that the differences in levels of psychological inertia among individuals with schizophrenia is not only due to avolition but could be caused by attention deficits or action-readiness deficits. = Crime = Psychological inertia is believed to be one explanation factor in crime continuity, that is the persistence of criminal behaviour. Glenn Walter's psychological inertia theorem states that crime continuity is partly caused by cognitive factors that account for the continuity in behaviour between past and future criminality and derives from his broader 'lifestyle theory' model, which explains the overall development of a criminal lifestyle. Walter's theorem is based upon Newton's law of inertia which states that a body will remain in motion until acted upon by an outside force, in which here the body in motion is crime. Within this theorem, Walter attributes six slow-changing variables that when combined link past criminality with future criminality. These six cognitive variables are: # Criminal thinking (antisocial attitudes and irrational thought patterns) # Positive outcome expectancies for crime (belief that crime will have specific positive outcomes) # Attribution biases (tendency to view the world as hostile and others as malicious) # Efficacy expectations (lack of confidence in one's ability to avoid criminal opportunities in the future) # Goals (i.e. focus on short-term goals which becomes detrimental to long-term goals) # Values (pursuit of self-indulgent pleasure and immediate gratification) The psychological inertia theorem argues that criminal involvement gives rise to these six cognitive variables which then encourage further offending behaviour. Theories surrounding the expectation of behavioural continuity are a topic of debate in the criminal justice community. But the conventional wisdom that past behaviour is the best predictor of future behaviour has generally led to \\"an expectation that offenders with histories of criminal violence in the community are at increased risk for disruptive conduct in prison [and] has been operationalized as a routine component in prison risk classifications\\". = Workplace = Psychological inertia has been found to be prevalent in change management within the workplace due to the fact it causes individuals to feel anxiety and fear as a result of any type of change away from the status-quo which may bring new responsibilities and roles. There are a variety of different interventions that have been suggested to overcome this psychological inertia which include providing fuller information including explaining the benefits that such a change will bring, causing people to feel less anxious and more motivated to carry out this change.

Definition of personal data CCPA defines personal information as information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked (directly or indirectly) with a particular consumer or household such as a real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, social security number, driver's license number, passport number, or other similar identifiers. An additional caveat identifies, relates to, describes, or is capable of being associated with, a particular individual, including, but not limited to, their name, signature, Social Security number, physical characteristics or description, address, telephone number, passport number, driver's license or state identification card number, insurance policy number, education, employment, employment history, bank account number, credit card number, debit card number, or any other financial information, medical information, or health insurance information. It does not consider Publicly Available Information as personal. Key differences between CCPA and the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) include the scope and territorial reach of each, definitions related to protected information, levels of specificity, and an opt-out right for sales of personal information. CCPA differs in definition of personal information from GDPR as in some cases the CCPA only considers data that was provided by a consumer and excludes personal data that was purchased by, or acquired through third parties. The GDPR does not make that distinction and covers all personal data regardless of source. In the event of sensitive personal information, this does not apply if the information was manifestly made public by the data subject themselves, following the exception under Art.9(2),e). As such, the definition in GDPR is much broader than defined in the CCPA.  History  The CCPA was signed by Gov. Brown on June 28, 2018 and became effective on January 1, 2020. The act's effect was dependent upon the withdrawal of initiative 17-0039, the Consumer Right to Privacy Act. Five amendments were enacted and signed by Gov. Newsom on October 11, 2019. Notice of DOJ's proposed regulations was also published October 11 in the Z Register; the OAL had not yet filed the final regulations with the Secretary of State, as required for the regulations to become effective. The initiative, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, was proposed by Californians for Consumer Privacy. The DOJ approved the initiative's official language on December 18, 2017 allowing the proponents to begin collecting petition signatures. 2020 California Proposition 24 proposes several changes to the CCPA.

History It was founded by J.R. Grove and J. Benson Oder; the latter had previously served in the Confederate army under Stonewall Jackson. Oder assumed sole proprietorship of the paper in 1873 and continued his role as editor until the paper was sold and renamed in 1913, even while being elected to Maryland's House of Delegates in 1877. After the newspaper's publishing company failed in 1913, Peter L. Livengood bought its printing plant and subscription list and commenced publishing that September under the new name The Frostburg Spirit, which was considered the successor to the Mining Journal. Livengood announced in 1915 that he had sold the Spirit to Lawrence Hitchens, with J. Benson Oder returning as editor, and that the publication would resume its former name of Frostburg Mining Journal. He published an announcement in the January 28, 1915 issue of the Spirit stating, \\"My only reason for selling The Spirit can be summed up in two words--poor health.\\" The second iteration of the Mining Journal would only run for a few short years before stopping publication in June 1917. Content The Mining Journal concerned itself mainly with local events and community issues, with a few major events capturing its attention over the course of its publication. The first of these was a large fire which destroyed a large part of downtown Frostburg in 1874; another was the Great Strike of 1882, which Oder and the paper were sympathetic towards. An advertisement was placed in the paper by miners in April 1873 calling for a meeting to form a union \\"for the better protection of [their] interests.\\" Oder's editorials during the 1880s were supportive of organized labor associations and of the striking coal miners in the region.

Nogarotto is Executive Chairman for Corporate Advisory for the CT Group (formerly Crosby Textor Group) and is a board member of Football Federation Australia. Early life and education Nogarotto was born in the Sydney suburb of Annandale to Anita (n√©e Toppano) and Celso Nogarotto. His parents had both immigrated from Italy; his father from village near Venice and his mother from Udine. When his mother died when he was 13, his father briefly moved his family to Italy. After returning to Australia, Nogarotto attended high school at the Patrician Brothers' College, Fairfield. Nogarotto graduated from the University of Sydney after studying economics and industrial law. Political and working career In 1983 Nogarotto was an unsuccessful Australian Labor Party (ALP) candidate for the Smithfield ward of the Fairfield Council. After graduating from university he worked in industrial relations before focusing on policy. In 1985 he was appointed chief executive office of the New South Wales Housing Industry Association at the age of 25, a role he would hold for 13 years. When Bronwyn Bishop switched from the Senate to the House of Representatives in 1994, Nogarotto was suggested as a Liberal Party replacement by former New South Wales premier Nick Greiner. The Sydney Morning Herald suggested that his Labor Party background may have been an impediment to gaining preselection. In 1997, Nogarotto joined Boral Group as a general manager for business development. Nogarotto replaced Tony Nutt as New South Wales state director of the Liberal Party in January 1998. In the wake of the Liberal Party loss in the 1999 New South Wales state election, senior Liberal figures such as Jeff Kennett called for Nogarotto's sacking. Former leader Peter Collins described the campaign as \\"the most incompetent election campaign that the Liberal Party has run in living memory\\" and suggested Nogarotto should take responsibility. Nogarotto ultimately resigned in January 2000. Soccer Nogarotto was elected to the board of Club Marconi in 1983 and served as chairman of the Marconi Stallions from 1988 to 1993. Between 1989 and 1993, Nogarotto was a director of the New South Wales Soccer Federation. In 1998, Nogarotto became chairman of National Soccer League (NSL) expansion team Northern Spirit. After the departure of David Hill as Soccer Australia chairman in 1998, Nogarotto backed Nick Greiner as replacement. In February 2000, the Australian Professional Footballers Association sued Northern Spirit alleging that Nogarotto had sacked two players, Robert Enes and Anthony Perinich, because of their membership of the association. In May 2000, Nogarotto announced the sale of a controlling 51 percent of the Northern Spirit to Scottish club Rangers F.C.. After the founding of Newcastle United in 2000, Nogarotto served as a consultant to club owner Con Constantine, moving to a full-time role in 2001. Nogarotto was elected chairman of Soccer Australia in December 2002, the fifth man to hold the position in seven years. He and most of his board resigned in April 2003 to make way for a new regime led by Frank Lowy. In November 2018 was elected to the board of Football Federation Australia (FFA), a successor organisation to Soccer Australia.

Born in Llangollen, in Denbighshire, Jones became an apprentice baker when he was fifteen, but later followed his father and elder brother into coal mining, working at Wynnstay, Gresford and then Llay Main. He joined the North Wales Miners' Association (NWMA), representing Llay Main on its council, and then becoming the union's president.Keith Gildart, \\"Jones, Edward ('Ted')\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.XIV, pp.188-199 General Secretary of the NWMA, Hugh Hughes, died in 1932, and while it was temporarily run by the district executive, in 1934 it finally ran an election for his replacement. Jones defeated president Thomas Jones and Robert Ellis from Hafod to win the post. His first act was to rename the union as the \\"North Wales and Border Counties Mineworkers' Association\\". He worked to increase union membership, represented the union at inquiries into the Gresford disaster, and led a largely unsuccessful five-week strike at Bersham. He managed to gradually build up a branch at Point of Ayr, leading eventually to the dissolution of the rival Point of Ayr Industrial Union. The NWMA was part of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain, and in 1944 this became the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), with the NWMA becoming its North Wales Area. This meant less autonomy, but Jones came to greater national prominence, winning election to the national executive committee of the NUM, on which he was known as a right-winger. He was offered a post with the National Coal Board in 1949, but turned it down as it would have meant moving away from Wales. By 1954, Jones was the longest-serving member of the NUM's executive, and he won election as the union's vice president. He defeated Alex Moffat to retain the vice- presidency in both 1955 and 1959, and also served a term as secretary of the Miners' International Federation. Following the death of president-elect Alwyn Machen in 1960, Jones spent a few months as acting president of the union, retiring in 1961. In his spare time, Jones represented the Labour Party on Wrexham Borough Council, and was also a magistrate.

He is the namesake of Henderson Boulevard and Henderson Avenue as well as the former W. B. Henderson Elementary School. Henderson served with the Confederacy during the Civil War. His company's captain was James Gettis, who raised Henderson's brothers after the death of his father. He then served in the \\"Cow Cavalry\\" and commanded it after John T. Lesley was wounded. After the war, along with Lesley and James McKay, Henderson shipped cattle to Cuba. He was a member of the firm of Miller & Henderson, then the largest store south of Jacksonville, which housed Tampa's first telegraph. Henderson was instrumental in bringing cigar manufacturers Gavino Gutierrez, Ignacio Haya, and Vicente Martinez Ybor to Tampa.

He was for ten years president of the State Board of Health. He was a part of the Beckwith, Henderson and Warren real estate agency, and held several pieces of land. He also helped start the Tampa Times newspaper, and was president of the Bank of West Tampa Early years William B. Henderson was born on September 17, 1839 in Maysville, Georgia to Andrew H. Henderson and Floria Olivia McDonald. He arrived in Tampa (then Fort Brooke) in October 1846 with his parents. His father was an Irish farmer and an invalid who lived on the corner of Florida Avenue and Whiting Street. Henderson attended the first school in Tampa, established by William P. Wilson in September 1848. John T. Lesley also attended. School was cancelled at 10:00 am on the day of the 1848 hurricane, which Henderson recalled made people \\"hug the ground\\" in order to move.

He would also travel to Mobile, Alabama regularly, carrying such cargo as watermelons and gophers. Henderson also helped start the banana trade with Central America. Miller and Henderson also served as bankers for area cattlemen. Telegraph The first telegrapher in Tampa was Walter Coachman from Jacksonville, with the Tampa and Fort Meade Telegraph Company, whose office was in the store. Cigars Cigar manufacturers Ignacio Haya and Vicente Martinez Ybor had intended to move their business to Galveston. Gavino Gutierrez brought them to Tampa and they visited the store, where they were offered some property by Henderson and W. C. Brown of the Circuit Court. They declined the offer, but it played a role in their moving to Tampa. Brown, Henderson, and A. J. Knight were appointed by the Board of Trade to raise $4,000 to bring the cigar business to Tampa. Without waiting for the $4,000, the cigar plants were completed in Ybor City by 1886. =Wagons= 1899 ad With his wife's cousin John B.

Savannah acquired the boat in 2014, with $1.2 million of its cost paid for through a FEMA Port Security Grant. Like all fireboats paid for through FEMA grants, the fireboat is equipped to work during disasters where it has to cope with dangerous chemical spills, or when the air is contaminated with nuclear, chemical or germ warfare agents. Operational history The fireboat rescued dozens of passengers when a local ferry dock collapsed. Retirement debate Fire Chief Charles G. Middleton, who played a key role in the Fire Department's acquisition of the fireboat, announced his retirement on October 31, 2018. The city closed down its central fire-station, where Marine One was moored, together with Engine 16, telling local businesses and residents that they would receive adequate firefighting services from nearby fire stations. Savannah Alderman Julian Miller justified the retirement by asserting the boat cost $500,000 to operate, and had never been employed fighting fires, and that smaller boats available to the fire department could be used to perform marine rescues. Kenneth Slatkovsky, a Savannah official, said the fireboat will remain moored at the closed station, and will be under a minimum operational maintenance schedule, so it would be available, if needed, after the firefighters trained to use her were called from their current assignments. Elements of the United States Coast Guard would be called upon for firefighting and marine rescue services, as would commercial tugboats.

It has been classified as a SW Sextantis variable, and its apparent visual magnitude varies between 14.04 and 17. Spectrum The spectrum of PX Andromedae is variable, but typically shows a continuum with prominent broad emission lines of hydrogen and helium. Unlike many types of cataclysmic variable, the emission lines are generally single-peaked, although for a short time during each orbit they do show a double peak due to an absorption core within the emission lines. The single- peaked lines are shown in novae and dwarf novae outbursts, and PX Andromedae is often described as nova-like although it does not shown outbursts with large increases in brightness. However, it does have high and low states with the low states generally being fainter and showing weaker emission. PX Andromedae is a very blue star with an ultraviolet excess, indicating that it includes very hot objects. Variability PX Andromedae generally has a visual magnitude around 15 although there are continual rapid variations of up to a tenth of a magnitude on a timescale of minutes. Approximately every 3.5 hours the brightness drops by around a magnitude and then returns to the normal brightness in about half an hour, without a flat bottom, easily identifiable as partial eclipses. However, the depth of the eclipses varies from about 0.5 magnitudes to 1.5 magnitudes, and this appears to cycle every 4.8 days, coinciding with the negative superhump cycle. Deeper eclipses occur when the superhump cycle is near its minimum. Possible variations with a period of 0.207 days are likely to be an observational alias of the superhump period. PX Andromedae may have both high (brighter) and low (fainter) states for its mean brightness, but the timing of these is uncertain. The eclipses have been timed to occur every 0.1463 days, assumed to be the orbital period. The negative superhump period is 4.43 days. Positive superhumps have sometimes been claimed, but are not always present. Stars with this type of variation are classified as SW Sextantis variables and PX Andromedae is sometimes considered as one of the prototypes for the class. Although they are considered to be cataclysmic variables and are often described as \\"nova-like\\", they do not show intermittent outbursts. Rather they are in a continuous outburst state with a spectrum similar to an ongoing nova. System Since the spectral classification of PX Andromedae is peculiar and similar to U Geminorum, it's commonly accepted that in this system a white dwarf is accreting matter from a donor star, and an accretion disc has formed around the former. The negative superhumps show that the accretion disk is tilted with respect to the white dwarf rotation axis, and has a retrogade precession. Moreover, the donor star doesn't eclipse the central part of the disk, otherwise there wouldn't be any modulation of the eclipse depth.

The approximately oval leaves are 3¬Ω‚Äì5 cm (1.4‚Äì2.0 in) long and 1¬Ω‚Äì3 cm (0.6‚Äì1.2 in) wide with a blunt, thickened, reddish tip or with three crowded teeth. It has cylinder-shaped inflorescences topped by a crest of green leaves, further consisting of heads with 12-22 individual bright yellow flowers, each in the axil of a flat, green leaf. It is an endemic species that is restricted to limestone outcrops in the Agulhas plains in the very south of the Western Cape province of South Africa. It is considered an endangered species. Flowering may occur between July and December, but is unreliable in its timing, dependent on sufficient moisture availability.  Description  Habit. Mimetes saxatilis is an evergreen, upright, rarely branching shrub of 1‚Äì2¬º m (3‚Öì‚Äì7¬º ft) high. Its branches are ¬Ω‚Äì1 cm (0.2‚Äì0.4 in) thick, initially densely felty, later becoming hairless. After the leaves are shed, cospicuous marks remain. The leathery leaves are alternately set, at a slight upward angle and somewhat overlapping and lack both stipules and a leaf stalks. The leaves are elliptic to broadly oval, 3¬Ω‚Äì5 cm (1.4‚Äì2.0 in) long and 1¬Ω‚Äì3 cm (0.6‚Äì1.2 in) wide with an entire margin and a blunt thickened tip or with three crowded teeth, with a row of hairs along the rim and an initially felty, later hairless surface. The inflorescences at the top of the shoots are cylinder-shaped, 5‚Äì10 cm (2‚Äì4 in) long and 5‚Äì6 cm (2.0‚Äì2.4 in) in diameter below a crest of green, oval or elliptic, more or less upright leaves. The flower heads consist of fourteen to twenty two individual flowers and are subtended by an ordinary, flat, green leaf. The outer whorl of bracts that encircle the flower heads are loosely arranged, oval to broadly lance-shaped with a pointy tip, 1‚Äì2¬Ω cm (0.4‚Äì1.0 in) long and 6‚Äì8 mm (¬º‚Äì‚Öì in) wide, with a hairless surface except for a row of hairs along the edge. The bracts on the inside of the head are narrowly lance-shaped, 1¬º‚Äì2¬Ω cm (¬Ω‚Äì1 in) long and ¬º‚Äì¬Ω cm (0.1‚Äì0.2 in) wide. The bract that subtend the individual flower is lance- shaped, 1¬º‚Äì2¬º cm (0.5‚Äì0.9 in) long and 1‚Äì2 mm (0.04‚Äì0.08 in) wide, with very densely silky margins. The yellow 4-merous perianth is 3‚Äì3¬Ω cm (1.2‚Äì1.4 in) long. The lower part called tube, that remains merged when the flower is open, is about 2 mm (0.08 in) long, slightly inflated, and hairless. The four segments in the middle part (or claws), are thread-shaped and have some felty hairs. The segments in the upper part (or limbs), which enclosed the pollen presenter in the bud, are boat-shaped, line-shaped with a pointy tip in outline, about 5 mm long, with a few scattered hairs. The four anthers are about 2 mm (0.08 in) long, lack a filament and are directly connected to the limbs. From the centre of the perianth emerges a slender style of 3‚Äì5 cm (1.2‚Äì2.0 in) long, that is pale yellow near the pollen presenter. The thickened part at the tip of the style called pollen presenter has a ring at its base, is squared cylinder-shaped in the middle and pointy egg-shaped at the tip. The approximately 1 mm (0.04 in) long ovary is egg-shaped, finely silky hairy, and is subtended by four pointy, awl- to line-shaped scales of about 2 mm (0.08 in) long. The ovary develops into a cylinder-shaped fruit of 6‚Äì8 mm (¬º‚Äì‚Öì in) long and 3‚Äì4 mm in diameter. = Differences with related species = The limestone pagoda can be distinguished from other Mimetes species by the pale yellow colour of the involucral bracts, that are hairless except for a hairy fringe, the large number (12‚Äì22) of yellow flowers per head, each with a yellow style. The pollen presenter has a very typical shape, a squared cylinder at its base and pointy egg-shaped at the tip. Only two other Mimetes species are yellow-flowered. The golden pagoda M. chrysanthus, has 25‚Äì35 individual flowers per head and its involucral bracts are woolly at base. The flower heads of the small cryptic pagoda M. palustris contain three to six individual flowers, and the leaves in the inflorescence are tightly overlapping, not patent as in both larger species.  Taxonomy  The limestone pagoda was first collected by Rudolf Schlechter in 1896 from the neighborhood of Elim, who called it Mimetes saxatilis without giving a proper description. This was published eventually by Edwin Percy Phillips in 1911. No synonyms are known. The species name saxatilis is a Latin word that means \\"that lives amongst rocks\\".  Distribution and habitat  Mimetes saxatilis can be found in an approximately 100 km (63 mi) long, narrow strip along the south coast of about 3 km (2 mi) wide between Franskraal in the west and Struisbay, several km east of Cape Agulhas, and from there in a narrow strip inland to around Bredasdorp. It occurs from sea level to at most 180 m (590 ft). It only grows on limestone of the Alexandria Formation and derived alkaline soils. It seems to do best in sinkholes and crevices where the rock is bare. It grows together with other Proteacea that prefer limestone, including Leucospermum patersonii, Protea obtusifolia and Leucadendron meridianum. Flowers may open anywhere between July and December, but this seems to depend on the availability of sufficient moisture. Over most of its distribution, the average annual precipitation is about 400 mm (16 in). The fruits are ripe about 9 months after flowering.  Conservation  The limestone pagoda is considered an endangered species due to the very limited areas where its populations occupy within a distribution area of , the continuing decline of its five known subpopulations as a result of ongoing urban sprawl and competition by invasive plant species. It is also under threat because alien ants like Linepithema humile (Argentine ant), destroy the nests of the indigenous ants, and unlike the native ants eat the elaiosomes where ever the seed has fallen, so that it is not protected against fire and can easily be found and eaten by mice and birds.

Coxwold Pottery Gallery in 2010 The pottery produced slipware decorated pottery, including kitchenware, tableware, planters and commemorative pieces, mostly thrown on the wheel. Their methods varied over the years from low-fired earthenware to high-fired, the techniques changing somewhat when they largely changed over to electric kiln firing in the early 1980s. William Alfred Ismay described their work as \\" . . practical and useful, and the overall impression is of warmth and generosity - a real 'country pottery' feeling\\".  The Potters  Peter Dick working in the pottery in 2003. Peter Dick worked with Michael Cardew in Nigeria then with Ray Finch at the Winchcombe Pottery in the Cotswolds. An article by Peter, reminiscing on his experiences in Abuja with other background information, appeared in 'Interpreting Ceramics', Issue 3. A valuable 'family tree' of potters shows his relationship to these potters. His distinctive style of potting and decoration was well-recognised and shown in many exhibitions, for example the Craft Council Domestic Pottery year-long touring exhibition round the UK. As well, a number of Museums and public collections have Peter Dick pots. For example, the City of York Art Gallery 'Centre for Ceramic Art' (CoCA) records having 46 pieces of pottery by Peter Dick, 23 of these from the W A Ismay collection. A speciality became the making of large commemorative plates, these were often commissioned by customers to celebrate family events. Two typical Coxwold Pottery pots by Peter Dick from the 1970s, showing colour of glazes and the 'speckled' effect produced by the wood firing. As well as making pots, Dick participated in the studio pottery movement, being involved with the Crafts Council, the UK Craft Potters Association (Board Member for a period) and the Northern Potters Association (of which he was a founder member.) Jill Frances Dick (n√©e Smith) was an artist and noted potter in her own right. Having studied art at Gloucestershire College of Art, she established her own small pottery in Winchcombe. In the early years of the Coxwold Pottery, she actually produced more pottery than Peter, before family commitments reduced her activity. When she resumed her active potting, she developed an interest in raku ware. Her pottery was shown in various exhibitions and sold through outlets such as ‚ÄòContemporary Ceramics‚Äô and the ‚ÄòCraftsmen Potters Shop and Gallery‚Äô in London. In recognition of her skills and standing she was made an Honorary Member of the Craft Potters Association.  The Pottery = Coxwold' pottery = Their products are usually referred to as ‚ÄòCoxwold pottery‚Äô, not as ‚ÄòPeter Dick‚Äô or ‚ÄòJill Dick‚Äô pots. It does not refer to the business. The Pottery was just off the Oulston Road in Coxwold, originally this was a dairy barn with an orchard. The Pottery closed in 2012, following the death of Peter Dick. =Wood firing techniques = Most of their pottery was produced in a wood-fired kiln, a method that Peter Dick had observed while working with his mentor, Michael Cardew, in Abuja Nigeria from 1961 to 1962. Though labour-intensive, needing an all-night firing, the ash from the kiln landing on the pottery gave the glaze a mottled effect to the largely brown to yellow glazes. The pottery especially in the early years was fired in a bourry fire box-style kiln, later a second chamber for stoneware was added. =Marks= The pottery marks used by Coxwold Pottery were mostly an impressed mark in the form of an apple tree, as a reference to the orchard on the property. This changed slightly from 1969. Peter and Jill had their own marks in the form of their initials. =Outlets and exhibitions= An example of Coxwold Pottery from the mid 1970s, following in 1973 a three month visit to Eastern Europe and Turkey (see Borthwick ref), which for a period inspired 'arabesque' themed decoration.The pottery was sold through a number of outlets, including their own showroom in Coxwold, but also in London for a time through the Elizabeth David shop, Harrods, 'Alicat', and the ‚ÄòCraftsmen Potter's Shop and Gallery‚Äô in Soho. Coxwold pottery also featured in exhibitions across the UK and abroad, for example the Craft Council Domestic Pottery year-long touring exhibition round the UK, which then toured in France. Another exhibition which included examples of Peter Dick's work was ‚ÄòMichael Cardew and Pupils‚Äô, held at York Art Gallery in 1983, this also toured in the UK.

In Austria, she was a prominent social worker, politician and writer who became increasingly interested in Zionism. One of the leading members of Vienna's Jewish National Party, she organized and actively contributed to the First World Congress of Jewish Women which was held in Vienna in May 1923. At the American Jewish Congress in Chicago in 1925, she addressed the opening session. After emigrating to Palestine in 1935, she became a member of the Mizrahi Women‚Äôs Organization, founded the Women's Social Service, and continued her welfare work which was mainly concerned with children and immigrants. Biography Born on 6 June 1890 in Vienna, Anitta Rosenzweig was the daughter of the merchant Salomon Rosenzweig and his wife Sofie n√©e Schnabel. Brought up in a well-to-do Jewish home, she is thought to have attended the Vienna B√ºrgerschule or high school and the Von Hoeniger boarding school in Breslau. She then spent two years at Vienna's P√§dagogikum or teacher training college where she may have qualified as a schoolteacher. In 1909, she married Arnold M√ºller, a merchant, with whom she had a daughter, Blanka, who died in 1938. After they divorced in August 1921, the following October she married Samuel Cohen, also a merchant, with whom she had a daughter, Ruth, in 1928, in addition to the two daughters, Eliezer and Ester, he brought into the household. She had met Cohen, a keen Zionist, while accompanying children on a recovery stay in Switzerland. The marriage significantly strengthened Anitta M√ºller-Cohen's own interest in Zionism. During the years of World War I, she devoted herself to social work, establishing the Soziale Hilfsgemeinschaft Anitta M√ºller (Anitta M√ºller Social Assistance Community) which managed a group of institutions for homeless children, mothers and refugees. Her tea and soup kitchen catered to some 3,000 people a day. In particular, she provided assistance to refugees from Galicia and Bukovina. In 1923, M√ºller-Cohen made all the main local preparations for the World Congress of Jewish Women which opened on 6 May 1923 at the Hofburg in the presence of the Austrian president Michael Hainisch and other dignitaries. At the congress, she made a detailed presentation on problems facing the care of children as a result of the First World War. During the 1920s, she made several trips to Palestine and also visited the United States where she spoke during the opening session of the 1925 American Jewish Congress in Chicago. At the second World Conference of Jewish Women, held in 1929 in Hamburg, she was elected as a vice-president of the World Federation of Jewish Women. Although M√ºller had planned to emigrate to Palestine with her family in the mid-1920s, in the end they first moved to Luxembourg (1929) and then to London (1932) where she was able to continue her Zionist activities. They finally moved to Tel Aviv in 1935. She continue her work on new children and worked with new immigrants, creating Hitahdut Olei Austria, the Association of Austrian Immigrants.

John and his father, also called John Hargreaves, were carriers in the north west of England at the time when railways were being built and taking business away from the canals. Personal life John Hargreaves was born on 22 October 1800 in Lancashire, England. He married Mary Hick (born 1813), daughter of Benjamin Hick of Benjamin Hick & Sons, on 19 October 1836 in St Peter's Parish Church, Bolton le Moors. The Hargreaves lived in Bolton, initially at Newport House and then at Rose Hill. Hargreaves served as a town councillor from 1845 to 1848 and was a local magistrate. In later years the Hargreaves purchased the Selwood Park Estate in Sunninghill, Berkshire. Hargreaves died in 1874, aged 74, leaving eight surviving children and his widow well provided for, his fortune amounting to ¬£600,000. Railway carrier In the 1830s Hargreaves was already an established carrier in his own right based at Castlefield Wharf, Manchester, on the Bridgewater Canal. In these early days of railways there was no decided way about how the railway should be managed and operated, but there was a \\"long-established principle that a highway should be open to all comers. Established carriers were admitted to a share in railway goods traffic, using either their own or the railway companies' vehicles, though the extent to which they might do so varied greatly from line to line.\\" The Liverpool & Manchester Railway (L&MR;), which chose to carry all goods on its own account and exclude carriers, nevertheless contracted with Hargreaves so that he had the exclusive right to all traffic to Bolton and Leigh, thereby creating a monopoly. The Bolton and Leigh Railway had originally opened for goods traffic in 1928 and initially had carried goods itself, although allowing private individuals to work their own wagons. In 1831 when the Bolton and Leigh Railway, and the newly built connecting Kenyon and Leigh Junction Railway, opened throughout allowing the passage of trains to and from Bolton to Liverpool and Manchester via the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, both railways leased their operations exclusively to Hargreaves, who at that time owned about 200 wagons and even provided the locomotives. Ransom reports that the \\"controversy went on for years over the extent to which steam railways should either admit carriers, to avoid monopoly and keep rates down, or should not admit them, so that all trains and vehicles should be under the control of the railway company in the interest of safety.... Nevertheless the 'private owner' wagon became a feature of railways in Britain, and to this day provides a reminder that public railways were originally thought of as highways open to all.\\" Hargreaves and his father were offered the lease for carrying freight on the Wigan Branch Railway in 1834, but they did not like the rates being offered and declined, making a counteroffer which was accepted by the North Union Railway, which had in the meantime been formed by an amalgamation of the Wigan Branch Railway and the Preston and Wigan Railway. On 19 February 1841 Hargreaves became the carrier on the Bolton & Preston Railway and around the same time on the Lancaster & Preston Junction Railway. Hargreaves continued as a railway carrier until 1845 when the Bolton to Kenyon route was absorbed into the Grand Junction Railway (GJR). The GJR terminated the carrier contracts on 31 December 1845. From 1840 to 1843 Hargreaves was chairman of the Bolton & Preston Railway. Hargreaves is listed as a Director of the Blackburn Railway and of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway in 1858. Although Hargreaves primarily dealt with freight traffic he continued to provide passenger services between Bolton and Kenyon where passengers changed to travel on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. He was a pioneer of innovative passenger operations, offering rail excursions. In 1841 he organised trips from Bolton to Liverpool on Sundays, and later he was advertising trips to Manchester and London. Other interests Hargreaves and three of his brothers were also engaged in the cotton trade, forming the partnership John Hargreaves and Brothers, The Victoria Cotton Mills, Fletcher Street. Hargreaves acquired a colliery at Coppull, Chorley, in 1842, and he leased an adjacent mine at Burgh; he worked the Coppull mine until 1862. Hargreaves used his own rolling stock to transport the coal to Preston over the North Union Railway, and when he ceased being a railway carrier in 1845 he retained two locomotives to continue the coal carriage. In 1845 Hargreaves formed a partnership with John Hick, who took over the engineering company Benjamin Hick & Sons following the death of his father. The company was based at the Soho Foundry, Crook Street, Bolton. Hargreaves left the firm in April 1850.

Hargreaves and his son, also John Hargreaves, were carriers in the north west of England at the time when railways were being built and taking business away from the canals. Early life John Hargreaves was the son of John (1739 - 1796) and Ann Hargreaves (nee Hamer) who had married in 1763. Hargreaves had three siblings, an older brother James, an older sister Elizabeth and a younger brother Hamer. The family established a carrier business at Hart Common, Westhoughton and Hargreaves's father had expanded it until it had become a substantial enterprise with \\"wagons to be seen on highways all over the North of England\\". Hargreaves was only 16, and therefore a minor, when his father died but he was the residuary legatee of his father's estate. His inheritance was therefore held in trust until his coming of age, the trustee was Elizabeth's husband John Pennington. Hargreaves married Tabitha Duckitt (1781 - 1847) in 1800. There were thirteen children with the eldest John (junior) being born that year. The family were based at Hart Common where the business was also based. Career The business was primarily packhorse based, using strings of animals who could pick their way over difficult terrain that was often impassable to horse drawn wagons. After his father's death in 1796 Hargreaves conducted business together with his mother. The business started to change in 1808 when Hargreaves started to use the Lancaster Canal to transport goods to the North. By 1818 Hargreaves was transporting goods from New Market St, Bolton \\"to Preston and all parts of the North; also to Bolton, Manchester, Bury, Rochdale, Leeds and all parts of Yorkshire\\". Hargreaves also operated from canal warehouse in Preston and advertised similar services including to London. In 1830 Hargreaves was operating canal boats \\"from Manchester and Liverpool to Summit, a point on the Manchester and Leeds canal, from which place the communication with the Lancaster canal was made by a rail or tram road of five miles to the town of Preston, from there the route was again by canal to Lancaster and Kendal and thence by stage waggons, Scotch carts, &c.;, to Penrith, Carlisle, Glasgow, Edinburgh and intermediate towns. Mr. Hargreaves' stage waggons, drawn by four or six powerful horses, and his canal \\"fly-boats\\" were institutions of the country\\". Father and son worked closely together as they moved into railway operations with John Hargreaves junior taking on the lease to operate the Bolton and Leigh Railway, they jointly took on the lease to operate the Kenyon and Leigh Junction Railway, but as the railways were joined this difference was at best academic as trains from one operated on the other. They were jointly offered the lease for carrying freight on the Wigan Branch Railway in 1834, but did not initially like the rates being offered and declined. They made a counter offer which was accepted by the North Union Railway which had in the meantime been formed by an amalgamation of the Wigan Branch Railway and the Preston and Wigan Railway. Later life Hargreaves owned property in Hindley as well as Westhoughton and was qualified to vote in both places. Hargreaves died at the age of eighty in 1860 leaving nine surviving children, he was buried at All Saints' Chapel, Hindley, where he had been a trustee.

He has served as the James O. Freedman Professor of Letters in the English Department at the University of Iowa since 1993.  Career  Stewart graduated with a B.A. from the University of Southern California in 1967 and then earned a Ph.D. in English from Yale University in 1971. He taught at Boston University and the University of California, Santa Barbara before joining the University of Iowa faculty. Across his career, Stewart has pursued a methodology of intense close-reading in the mediums of print, film, and (most recently) conceptual art. He describes his own work as existing at the intersection of stylistics and narrative theory. Examining the ways in which the larger structures of plot are operative at even the smallest of scales prompted Stewart in 2007 to develop the term \\"narratography\\"‚Äîi.e., a mapping of the ways in which technique constructs a particular narrative mode, whether in terms of stylistics (print) or editing/montage (film). Stewart describes narratography as \\"searching out the 'microplots' of narrative development in the inflections of technique, audiovisual or linguistic\\".  Work and main ideas  In his 1990 book Reading Voices: Literature and the Phonotext, Stewart argues that literature, despite its visual appearance, is essentially an acoustic medium. He draws on the neurophysiological phenomenon of \\"subvocalization\\" to suggest that literary poetics are produced by the \\"voice\\" that the reader gives to a text‚Äîwhat Stewart calls the \\"phonetic undertow of literary writing\\". Subvocalization has been corroborated by empirical science. Minuscule movements in the larynx and other muscles involved in speech have been observed in subjects during silent reading. While the vocal cords do not outwardly activate, it has been proposed that subvocalization reduces the cognitive load on working memory, and that reading comprehension depends as much on the way words \\"sound\\" in the reader's mind as it does on the words' visual (typographical) arrangement. Stewart argues that this phonotext, so often ignored by the \\"phonophobia\\" of post-Derridean deconstruction, opens up new inroads to literary analysis. When Shakespeare's Juliet asks \\"What's in a name?\\", for example, aurally she might also declare, \\"What sin a name\\". Stewart argues that our traditionally vision-centric reading habits cause us to be \\"deaf\\" to these permutations. In his 1999 book Between Film and Screen: Modernism's Photo Synthesis, Stewart draws on ideas in film theory‚Äîspecifically the work of Gilles Deleuze as well as British screen theory and its emphasis on the cinematic apparatus‚Äîto argue that as an art form cinema is haunted by its basis in still photography. While cinema creates the illusion of live action, this is only made possible by a strip of still frames as they speed past the projector. Stewart is interested in the ways in which film tries, and often fails, to repress this stillness in its representations of time and movement. In this respect, he views the various techniques of cinematic plotting to be influenced‚Äîif not determined‚Äîby the very machinery that makes them possible. If that's the case, then new/different film technologies ought to engender new/different kinds of plots and cinematic styles. Such is Stewart's contention in a follow-up book, Framed Time: Toward a Postfilmic Cinema (2007), where he argues that digital filmmaking is subsequently haunted by its basis, not in still photography, but the pixel array, leading to the internally-morphing representations of time in recent sci-fi films like the Wachowskis' The Matrix (1999) or Spielberg's Minority Report (2002). Stewart has published numerous other books, ranging from language in Charles Dickens to representations of death in British fiction. His 2009 Novel Violence: A Narratography of Victorian Fiction was awarded the Perkins Prize from the International Society for the Study of Narrative. More recently his scholarship has turned toward digital cinema and modes of surveillance (e.g., Closed Circuits: Screening Narrative Surveillance [2014]) as well as conceptual art (e.g., Bookwork: Medium to Object to Concept to Art [2011] and Transmedium: Conceptualism 2.0 and the New Object Art [2017]). He describes the common linkage between these various projects: Stewart remains active in his research and teaching at the University of Iowa. He was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2010.

Susan was born in San Pablo, California in 1870, the daughter of Willard Belmont Kingsbury, M.D., and Helen Shuler n√©e DeLamater, and was raised in Stockton, California. Her father died when she was six, leaving Helen to raise Susan and her brother. Helen was dean of women at the College of the Pacific, where Susan would matriculate then graduate with honors in 1890. From 1892‚Äì1900 she was a history teacher at Lowell High School in San Francisco, while tending to her ailing mother. She graduated with an A.M. in sociology from Stanford University in 1899, Phi Beta Kappa. Following the death of her mother, she moved to New York to study colonial economic history at Columbia University. In 1904, she taught history for a year at Vassar College. She graduated from Columbia with a Ph.D. in 1905, with a dissertation titled An Introduction to the Records of the Virginian Company of London. During her stay in London (1903‚Äì04), her readings inspired a personal interest in social reform. In 1906 she published the first of what would become a four volume set titled Records of the Virginian Company of London, with the final volume being completed in 1933. Dr. Kingsbury became director of investigation for the Massachusetts Commission on Industrial and Technical Education for a year beginning in 1905. The next year she accepted a position as instructor in history and economics at Simmons University, becoming head of the department. She gained the rank of associate professor in 1907. The same year she was also named director of research for the Women's Educational and Industrial Union in Boston. She served as president of the New England History Teachers Association in 1911. From 1911‚Äì13, she directed a national study of the opportunities for women in social service. Her various publications, including Labor Laws and Their Enforcement (1911) and Economic Efficiency of College Women (1911) caught the attention of Martha Carey Thomas, president of Bryn Mawr College. After listening to an address by Dr. Kingsbury in 1912, Thomas invited her to come to work at the College. In 1915 Dr. Kingsbury became director of the Carola Woerishoffer Graduate Department of Social Economy and Social Research at the college. This was the first graduate department in the country to train students for careers in social service. In 1919 she helped found the American Association of Schools of Social Work in 1919, and served as vice president of the American Economic Association and the American Sociological Society. She and Thomas founded the Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers in 1921. Susan was chairman of Pennsylvania's first minimum wage board and for nearly a decade served as chairman for the American Association of University Women Committee on Economic and Legislative Status on Women. During 1921‚Äì22 she toured China and India, then the Soviet Union in 1929‚Äì30, 1932, and 1936 to research conditions for women and children. She published her results of the Russia visits as co-author in 1935. She retired as professor emeritus of social economy at Bryn Mawr College in 1936.

Mother Machine. Installation view at Ex-girlfriend Gallery. Berlin 2018 ¬© Mit Borr√°s Mit Borr√°s (born 1982, Madrid) is a Spanish artist. He received his BFA at the Complutense University of Madrid in Madrid, Spain and specialization in Art and Cultural Studies in Berlin, (Germany). He developed his research on Media Art at the Twente University in Enschede, the Netherlands (2006) where he participated intensely in the Dutch contemporary art scene. He relocated back to Madrid where he oversees the production of video art festivals while also carrying out projects as an independent curator. In 2010 he moved to Berlin to participate in the Glogauair Residency and co-directed F√ºnf Galerie together with Rachel Lamot. He has worked as a coordinator of several cultural projects regarding media art and was working as a curator for the Instituto Cervantes in Berlin. He also currently combines his artistic practice with his work as an art critic in Neo2 Magazine. His work is exhibited internationally in selected exhibitions such as in the Hara Museum, Tokyo (2010), Kreuzberg Pavillon, Germany (2013) and Norway (2016), Fonoteca Nacional, Mexico DF (2010), Palacio Fernandini, Lima (2016), Aleph Projects, Tel Aviv (2017), and the Museum of Fine Arts in Chile (2017). He has also been represented by In√©s Barrenechea Gallery (2010‚Äì14). He continues to lecture within England, Colombia, Peru, the Netherlands, Spain and Germany. His work has been selected and awarded by Transmediale, (2011), United Creators Awards (2009), Loop Barcelona (2010, 2015‚Äì17), Art Lima (2016) and The Media Art Biennale in Chile (2017). He currently lives and works in Madrid and is a member of the international agency of artists and theorists Front Views in Berlin. Mit Borr√°s is represented by Ex-girlfriend Gallery  Themes  Club. Installation View. Mit Borr√°s, 2016 Mit Borr√°s addresses technology and progress as new cult paradigms, often through the visual language of health and sport. He toys with the idea of ergonomics and softness in the development of new industrial forms, present in the works carried out since 2014 such as: Control Pool, Orthopedics, Youth Cloud, Techno Light, Devices, Artificial Rocks, Drone State of Mind or Ergonomic Technology. These works praise the idea of technology and well-being as a structure model of our time. Borr√°s emphasizes the objects that surround us as the objects that eventually define us as individuals and as a society; drones, gadgets, prosthetics, immobilizers, textile trends and their microperforated elastic fabrics, synthetic materials, medical and biomechanical engineering, and the design of products for leisure and relax. The artist uses intersecting lenses of the contemporary body and technology to interpret the homo consumericus behavior and diagnose the crusade a Western individual of the 21st Century. In works such as Ergonomic Shape (2016) in which a block of granite is supported on a medicine ball, or the Stones series (2015) in which the artist disables tactile screens by tying them to large pieces of quartz, it is common to find disconnect between technology and nature. This confrontation between digital system and cosmos is presented by the artist as a reinterpretation of Sagan's idea that everything that is, what has been or what will be. For the artist, this implies a confrontation between a gullible society in a consumerist system and the innate course of nature. Works such as the palm trees of Palm Deformation (2016) or Club (2016) in which a gallery equipped with a strobe light and techno music is flooded with smoke, make allusion to all those current elements that are part of our life of evasion, fun and lightness, a lightness understood in the manner of Gilles Lipovetsky: like a ghost that frivolizes and makes provisional everything that was previously designed to be eternal.

These include case studies, computerized simulations, and lab experiments.  Case studies = Allocating indivisible heirlooms = 1\\\\. Flood describes a division of a gift containing 5 parcels: whiskey, prunes, eggs, suitcase, etc. The division was done using the Steinhaus-Banach-Knaster procedure. The resulting division was fair, but in retrospect it was found that coalitions could gain from manipulation. 2\\\\. When Mary Anna Lee Paine Winsor died at the age of 93, her estate included two trunks of silver, that had to be divided among her 8 grandchildren. It was divided using a decentralized, fair and efficient allocation procedure, which combined market equilibrium and a Vickrey auction. Although most participants did not fully understand the algorithm or the preference information desired, it handled the major considerations well and was regarded as equitable. = Allocating unused classrooms = In California, the law says that public school classrooms should be shared fairly among all public school pupils, including those in charter schools. Schools have dichotomous preferences: each school demands a certain number of classes, it is happy if it got all of them and unhappy otherwise. A new algorithm allocates classrooms to schools using a non-trivial implementation of the randomized leximin mechanism. Unfortunately it was not deployed in practice, but it was tested using computer simulations based on real school data. While the problem is computationally-hard, simulations show that the implementation scales gracefully in terms of running time: even when there are 300 charter schools, it terminates in a few minutes on average. Moreover, while theoretically the algorithm guarantees only 1/4 of the maximum number of allocated classrooms, in the simulations it satisfies on average at least 98% of the maximum number of charter schools that can possibly be satisfied, and allocates on average at least 98% of the maximum number of classrooms that can possibly be allocated. The partial collaboration with the school district lead to several practical desiderata in deploying fair division solutions in practice. First, the simplicity of the mechanism, and the intuitiveness of the properties of proportionality, envy-freeness, Pareto optimality, and strategyproofness, have made the approach more likely to be adopted. On the other hand, the use of randomization, though absolutely necessary in order to guarantee fairness in allocating indivisible goods such as classrooms, has been a somewhat harder sell: the term \\"lottery\\" raised negative connotations and legal objections. = Resolving international conflicts = The adjusted winner procedure is a protocol for simultaneously resolving several issues under conflict, such that the agreement is envy-free, equitable, and Pareto efficient. It has been commercialized through the FairOutcomes website. While there are no account of it actually being used to resolve disputes, there are several counterfactual studies checking what would have been the results of using this procedure to solve international disputes: * For the Camp David Accords, the authors construct approximate numeric valuation functions for Israel and Egypt, based on the relative importance of each issue for each country. They then run the AW protocol. The theoretical results are very similar to the actual agreement, which leads the authors to conclude that the agreement is as fair as it could be. * For the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, the author constructs the valuation functions based on a survey of expert opinions, and describes the agreement that would result from running the AW protocol with these valuations. *For the Spratly Islands dispute, the authors construct a two-phase procedure for settling the dispute, and present its (hypothetic) outcome. = Allocating rooms and rent = Rental harmony is the problem of simultaneously allocating rooms in an apartment and the rent of the apartment among the housemates. It has several solutions. Some of these solutions were implemented in the Spliddit.org website and tested on real users. = Sharing cooperation surplus = When different agents cooperate, there is an economic surplus in welfare. Cooperative game theory studies the question of how this surplus should be allocated, taking into account the various coalitional options of the players. Several cases of such cooperation has been studied, in light of concepts such as the Shapley value. = Fair Bargaining = Flood analyzed several cases of bargaining between a buyer and a seller on the price of purchasing a good (e.g. a car). He found that the \\"split-the-difference\\" principle was acceptable by both participants. The same cooperative principle was found in more abstract non-cooperative games. However, in some cases, bidders in an auction did not find a cooperative solution. = Fair Load-Shedding = Olabambo et al develop heuristic algorithms for fair allocation of electricity disconnections in developing countries. They test the fairness and welfare of their algorithms on electricity usage data from Texas, which they adapt to the situation in Nigeria.  Computerized simulations = Fair cake-cutting = Walsh developed several algorithms for online fair cake-cutting. He tested them using a computerized simulation: valuation functions for each agent were generated by dividing the cake into random segments, and assigning a random value to each segment, normalizing the total value of the cake. The egalitarian welfare and the utilitarian welfare of various algorithms were compared. = Welfare redistribution mechanism = Cavallo developed an improvement of the Vickrey‚ÄìClarke‚ÄìGroves mechanism in which money is redistributed in order to increase social welfare. He tested his mechanism using simulations. He generated piecewise-constant valuation functions, whose constants were selected at random from the uniform distribution. He also tried Gaussian distributions and got similar results. = Fair item assignment = Dickerson et al use simulations to check under what conditions an envy-free assignment of discrete items is likely to exist. They generate instances by sampling the value of each item to each agent from two probability distributions: uniform and correlated. In the correlated sampling, they first sample an intrinsic value for each good, and then assign a random value to each agent drawn from a truncated nonnegative normal distribution around that intrinsic value. Their simulations show that, when the number of goods is larger than the number of agents by a logarithmic factor, envy-free allocations exist with high probability. Segal-Halevi et al use simulations from similar distributions to show that, in many cases, there exist allocations that are necessarily fair based on a certain convexity assumption on the agents' preferences.  Laboratory experiments  Several experiments were conducted with people, in order to find out what is the relative importance of several desiderata in choosing an allocation. = Fairness vs. efficiency - what outcome is better? = Sometimes, there are only two possible allocations: one is fair (e.g. envy-free division) but inefficient, while the other is efficient (e.g. Pareto-optimal) but unfair. Which division do people prefer? This was tested in several lab experiments. 1\\\\. Subjects were given several possible allocations of money, and were asked which allocation they prefer. One experiment found that the most important factors were Pareto-efficiency and Rawlsian motive for helping the poor (maximin principle). However, a later experiment found that these conclusions only hold for students of economics and business, who train to acknowledge the importance of efficiency. In the general population, the most important factors are selfishness and inequality aversion. 2\\\\. Subjects were asked to answer questionnaires regarding the division of indivisible items between two people. The subjects were shown the subjective value that each (virtual) person attaches to each item. The predominant aspect considered was equity - satisfying each individual's preferences. The efficiency aspect was secondary. This effect was slightly more pronounced in economics students, and less pronounced in law students (who chose a Pareto-efficient allocation more frequently). 3\\\\. Subjects were divided into pairs and asked to negotiate and decide how to divide a set of 4 items between them. Each combination of items had a pre-specified monetary value, which was different between the two subjects. Each subject knew both his own values and the partner's values. After the division, each subject could redeem the items for their monetary value. The items could be divided in several ways: some divisions were equitable (e.g., giving each partner a value of 45), while other divisions were Pareto efficient (e.g., giving one partner 46 and another partner 75). The interesting question was whether people prefer the equitable or the efficient division. The results showed that people preferred the more efficient division only if it was not \\"too unfair\\". A difference of 2-3 value units was considered sufficiently small for most subjects, so they preferred the efficient allocation. But a difference of 20-30 units (such as in the 45:45 vs. 46:75 example) was perceived as too large: 51% preferred the 45:45 division. The effect were less pronounced when the subjects were only shown the rank of the item combinations for each of them, rather than the full monetary value. This experiment also revealed a recurring process which was used during the negotiation: subjects first find the most equitable division of the goods. They take it as a reference point and try to find Pareto improvements. An improvement is implemented only if the inequality it causes is not too large. This process is called CPIES: Conditioned Pareto Improvement from Equal Split. = Intra-personal vs. inter-personal fairness - which is more important? = What is the importance of intra-personal fairness criteria (such as envy-freeness, where each person compares bundles based only on his own utility-function), vs. inter-personal fairness criteria (such as equitability, where each person views the utilities of all other agents)? Using a free-form bargaining experiment, it was found that inter-personal fairness (e.g. equitability) is more important. Intra-personal fairness (such as envy-freeness) are relevant only as a secondary criterion. = Fairness vs. simplicity - what procedure is more satisfactory? = Divide and choose (DC) is a fair and very simple procedure. There are more sophisticated procedures that have better fairness guarantees. The question of which were more satisfactory was tested in several lab experiments. 1\\\\. Divide-and-choose vs Knaster-Brams-Taylor. Several pairs of players had to divide among them 3 indivisible goods (a ballpoint pen, a lighter and a mug) and some money. Three procedures were used: the simple DC, and the more complicated Adjusted Knaster (an improvement of adjusted winner) and Proportional Knaster. The authors asked the subjects to select their favorite procedure. Then, they let them play the procedure in two modes: binding (strict adherence to the protocol rules) and non-binding (possible renegotiation afterwards). They compared the procedures performance in terms of efficiency, envy-freeness, equitability and truthfulness. Their conclusions are: (a) The sophisticated mechanisms are advantageous only in the binding case; when renegotiation is possible, their performance drops to the baseline level of DC. (b) The preference for a procedure depends not only on the expected utility calculations of the negotiators, but also on their psychological profile: the more \\"antisocial\\" a person is, the more likely he is to opt for a procedure with a compensatory mechanism. The more risk-averse a person is, the more likely he is to opt for a straightforward procedure like DC. (c) The final payoff of a participant in a procedure depends a lot on the implementation. If participants cannot divide the goods under a procedure of their own choice, they are more eager to maximize their payoff. A shortened time horizon is equally detrimental. 2\\\\. Structured procedures vs. Genetic algorithms. Two pairs of players had to divide between them 10 indivisible goods. A genetic algorithm was used to search for the best division candidates: out of the 1024 possible divisions, a subset of 20 divisions was shown to the players, and they were asked to grade their satisfaction about the candidate division on a scale ranging from 0 (not satisfied at all) to 1 (fully satisfied). Then, for each subject, a new population of 20 divisions was created using a genetic algorithm. This procedure continued for 15 iterations until a best surviving allocation was found. The results were compared to five provably-fair division algorithms: Sealed Bid Knaster, Adjusted Winner, Adjusted Knaster, Division by Lottery and Descending Demand. Often, the best divisions found by the genetic algorithm were rated as more mutually satisfactory than the ones derived from the algorithms. Two possible reasons for that were: (a) Temporal fluctuation of preferences - the valuations of humans change from the point they report their valuations to the point they see the final allocation. Most fair division procedures ignore this issue, but the genetic algorithm captures it naturally. (b) Non-additivity of preferences. Most division procedures assume that valuations are additive, but in reality they are not; the genetic algorithm works just as well with non-additive valuations. 3\\\\. Simple procedures vs. Strongly-fair procedures. 39 player-pairs were given 6 indivisible gift- certificates of the same value ($10) but from different vendors (e.g. Esso, Starbucks, etc.). Before the procedure, each participant was shown all the 64 possible allocations, and was asked to grade the satisfaction and fairness of each of them between 0 (bad) and 100 (good). Then, they were taught seven different procedures, with different levels of fairness guarantees: Strict Alternation and Balanced Alternation (no guarantees), Divide and Choose (only envy-freeness), Compensation Procedure and Price Procedure (envy-freeness and Pareto-efficiency), Adjusted Knaster and Adjusted Winner (envy-freeness, Pareto-efficiency and equitability). They practiced each of these against a computer. Then, they did an actual division against another human subject. After the procedure, they were asked again to grade the satisfaction and fairness of the outcome; the goal was to distinguish procedural fairness from distributional fairness. The results showed that: (a) procedural fairness had no significant impact; satisfaction was mainly determined by distributional fairness. (b) the results of simpler procedures (strict alternation, balanced alternation and DC) were considered fairer and more satisfactory. They explain this couter-intuitive result by showing that humans care about object equality - giving each agent the same number of objects (though this does not entail any mathematical fairness criterion). = Efficiency vs. strategy - what procedure is more efficient? = Consider two agents that have to bargain on a deal, such as how to divide goods among them. Often, if they sincerely reveal their preferences, they can attain a win-win deal. However, if they strategically misrepresent their preferences in an attempt to gain, they might actually lose the deal. What negotiation procedure is most efficient in terms of attaining good deals? Several bargaining procedures were studied in the lab. 1\\\\. Sealed bid auction: a simple one-shot negotiation procedure. In the lab, information-advantaged players aggressively exploited asymmetric information, and drastically misrepresented their true valuation through strategic bidding. This often resulted in a reduced bargaining zone, forgone deals and low economic efficiency. In one experiment, deals were made on only 52% of all trials, while 77% of all trials had a positive bargaining zone. 2\\\\. Bonus procedure: a procedure that gives a bonus was given to participants making a deal. This bonus is calculated such that it is optimal for players to reveal their true preferences. Lab experiments show that this does not help: subjects still strategize, although it is bad for them. 3\\\\. Adjusted Winner (AW): a procedure that allocates divisible objects in order to maximize the total utility. In the lab, subjects bargained in pairs over two divisible objects. Each of the two objects was assigned a random value drawn from a commonly known prior distribution. Each player had complete information about their own values, but incomplete information about their co-bargainer‚Äôs values. There were three information conditions: (1) Competing Preferences: Players know that the preferences of their co-bargainer are similar to their own; (2) Complementary Preferences: Players know that the preferences of their co-bargainer are diametrically opposed to their own; (3) Unknown (Random) Preferences: Players do not know what their co-bargainer values most relative to their own preferences. In condition (1), the bilateral decisions converge toward efficient outcomes, yet only one-third are \\"envy-free\\". In condition (2), while players dramatically misrepresent their true valuation for objects, both efficiency and envy-freeness approach maximum levels. In condition (3), pronounced strategic bidding emerges, yet the result is twice as many envy- free outcomes, with increased levels of efficiency (relative to condition 1). In all cases, the structured AW procedure was quite successful in attaining a win-win solution - about 3/2 times more than unstructured negotiation. The key to its success is that it forces players out of the ‚Äòfixed pie myth‚Äô. 4\\\\. Conflict-resolution algorithm: Hortala-Vallve and lorente-Saguer describe a simple mechanism for solving several issues simultaneously (analogous to Adjusted Winner). They observe that equilibrium play increases over time, and truthful play decreases over time - agents manipulate more often when they learn their partners' preferences. Fortunately, the deviations from equilibrium do not cause much damage to the social welfare - the final welfare is close to the theoretic optimum. = How does sharing behavior develop in children? = In the lab, children were paired to \\"rich\\" and \\"poor\\" and were asked to share objects. There were differences in the perception of \\"initial belongings\\" vs. \\"things that have to be shared\\": young children (up to 7) did not distinguish them while older children (above 11) did.

His laboratory focuses on researching new methods in chemistry to selectively modify proteins and to deliver molecules to cells. His lab successfully modified proteins via ‚Äúpi-clamps‚Äù made up of different amino acids, and delivered large biomolecules, such as various proteins and drugs, into cells via the anthrax delivery vehicle. Pentelute has also made several key contributions to automated synthesis technologies. This includes a recent invention of the world's fastest polypeptide synthesizer. This system is able to form more amide-bonds at a more efficient rate than standard commercial equipment and has helped in the process of understanding protein folding and its mechanisms. The primary goal of his endeavor is to use these processes to create biologics that can be used to treat diseases.  Education  Pentelute grew up in San Diego, California, and earned both his B.A. in Psychology and B.S. in Chemistry from the University of Southern California in 2003. He continued his studies at the University of Chicago, where he earned his M.S. and Ph.D. in Chemistry. After receiving his Ph.D., Pentelute served as the senior scientist at Ethos Pharmaceuticals in 2008. He completed his postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard Medical School from 2008 to 2011 with R. John Collier in Microbiology. In 2011, Pentelute began his assistant professorship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he is currently an associate professor.http://www.sontagfoundation.org/media/1091/pentelute-cv.pdf  Research= Pi-clamp = A reagent binding to the cysteine site of an amino acid sequence (pi-clamp) to modify the protein's structure Selecting a cellular site and modifying its characteristics to perform specific functions is one of the most complex studies done in chemistry. Typical modification techniques involved using a catalyst or reaction pairs to change a site of interest. Cysteine residues were used in modifying proteins via bioconjugation because they acted as natural catalysts, however they lacked the ability to target specific sites. Pentelute was inspired to create a new site-selecting approach by altering an amino acid's environment in a peptide sequence. Hence, Pentelute and his lab created an amino acid sequence consisting of phenylalanine, cysteine, proline, and phenylalanine, known as the pi-clamp, to selectively modify a cysteine site in proteins. Having being made from natural compounds, the pi-clamp reacts with a perfluoroaromatic reagent and the cysteine thiol site, thus causing an overall decrease in the reaction's activation energy. Additional advantages of this pi-clamping technique compared to non-natural methods include the clamp being of small size and being able to have direct interaction with the site. This new approach for modification of cells helped researchers target site-specific cells and label proteins without the use of enzymes, which makes the modification process more efficient. A significant use of this method has been applied through the successful killing of breast cancer cells. = Anthrax toxin delivery = Moving peptide and protein therapeutics through the plasma membrane of cells has been made more efficient through the use of a platform made from the anthrax lethal toxin (PA/LFN), which arises from the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Pentelute's lab took more than two decades to develop this delivery vehicle. His studies of intracellular delivery help us understand the movements of proteins and to explore different biological functions within cells. Previous techniques to transport molecules through the plasma membrane of mammalian cells proved to be less effective and required higher concentrations of substance to be useful. When compared, the anthrax lethal toxin based delivery method was proved to transport proteins faster and more efficiently. Through the use of chemical ligation (NCL) and enzyme-mediated ligation using Sortase A (SrtA), non-native cargos that contain functionalities that don't naturally occur can be created that provide benefits such as increased stability to internal degradation of the cell, added use of affinity handles, and adjusted connective affinities to target molecules. These fusions also attach the resulting peptides to the N-terminus of the native lethal factor (LFN).

His descendants gained peerage titles including: Baronet Grey of Chillingham, Northumberland (1619); Baron Grey of Werke (1623/4); Baronet Grey of Howick (1746); Baron Grey of Howick (1801); Viscount Howick (1806); Earl Gret (1806). His most notable descendant was Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, 2nd Viscount Howick (1764-1845), KG, of Howick Hall, Prime Minister and supposed inventor of the famous tea. Description in the 16th century In 1541 Heaton Castle was described in a survey as \\"ruinous\\" but a later report identified \\"a vault that a hundred horses may stand in\\". By 1550 the ruins had been adapted \\"to form bases for large bastle type building with stone vault\\". The only remains surviving are two buttresses against the north-east wall of a stable-block, together with \\"probable remains of a turret and rampart\\". In the 1580s attempts at rebuilding and repair were made, but the project failed when the Grey family became involved in a dispute with the Crown concerning funding. History of the broader de Grey family The de Grey family was descended from Anchetil de Greye (c.1052 - post-1086), a Norman soldier and follower of William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford, one of the great magnates of early Norman England and one of the very few proven companions of William the Conqueror known to have fought at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Anchetil de Greye is regarded as the ancestor of the noble House of Grey, branches of which held many peerage titles in England, including Baron Grey de Wilton, Baron Grey of Codnor, Baron Grey de Ruthyn, Marquess of Dorset, Duke of Suffolk, and Earl of Stamford. They married into the royal family. Descendants of the branch seated at Heaton gained the peerage titles of: Earl of Tankerville (1419, 1695), Baronet Grey of Chillingham, Northumberland (1619); Baron Grey of Werke (1623/4); Viscount Glendale (1695), Baronet Grey of Howick (1746); Baron Grey of Howick (1801); Viscount Howick (1806), Earl Grey (1806) and Baronet Grey of Fallodon (1814). Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, 2nd Viscount Howick (1764-1845), KG, of Howick Hall, Prime Minister, and supposed inventor of the famous tea, was a descendant of the Heaton branch. Present In 2011 the estate of Castle Heaton (with Shellacres) was offered for sale at an asking price of ¬£11.5 million,The (Newcastle) Journal, 1 July 2011 an \\"enormous asking price\\" which was a record for recent years in the North East. It was described by The Journal, a local newspaper, as \\"one of the finest estates to come onto the market in recent years.

The house has a typical rectangular layout and on one of its long sides it has an outdoor patio. The square rooms are centered around this patio, without an internal hallway. To access another room, either one must walk through the patio to go to another room or walk through the doors between 2 adjacent rooms (privacy was in those times less of a concern). That gives these types of houses its typical casa chorizo name, as chorizo is a common Argentinean sausage that has several small sausages connected to each other through a string, that resembles the rooms in these houses.  History  From 1850 large immigration waves from middle-class families leaving mainly Italy and Spain moved to Buenos Aires and increased the population significantly. To make more efficient use of the space in the city, these types of houses were developed and built. Most of the houses originated between 1880 and 1930. The origin of these houses is based on Roman houses, Pompeyan houses and traditional colonial urban livings from Rio de la Plata. These patio houses are centered around square patios and split in 2 ‚ÄúL‚Äù shapes houses with each owning half the patio. They were built completely with stone bricks and to show the socio-economic status of the homeowner and family, the house fa√ßade possesses Italian style ornaments on the front street fa√ßade (fachadas) including columns, capitals, emblems together with high windows and high doors as house decoration. Casas chorizos can be found throughout the city of Buenos Aires, in San Telmo, Palermo and Almagro neighborhoods, but also in other cities such as Rosario and La Plata.  Dimensions and layout  floor plan. The typical dimensions of these houses are based on the old city measurements that used varas. The colonial block of houses measured 150 varas and each house width was given 10 varas, that is 8.66 metres. The house length varies between 16 and 30 meters and dependent on the terrain (that could go up till half a block deep, around 50 meters), the house can have an additional back garden. Most of these houses are located with its short side to the street and its long side into the block of houses, so that multiple houses could be built next to each other. But some rare houses are built with the long side to the street and provides light from the street as well as from the internal patio. The rooms measure 4x4 meters. As the rooms all have doors and windows above the doors to the internal patio to ventilate the roomspaces Also, the ceiling height that measures between 4‚Äì5 meters high helps further to accommodate the high summer heat as well the colder winter temperatures in Argentina. In addition, these livings also have floor ventilation space underneath the house. These ventilation spaces are connected through air vents that can be seen in the facade front wall below and above the windows. The houses are rectangular shaped with all rooms interconnected, and the houses are entered from one of the short sides. The layout is based on a ‚Äúhierarchy of rooms‚Äù. The bathrooms, kitchen and dining room are furthest away from the entrance. These rooms could be connected with a small patio. The next rooms are the children‚Äôs room, grandparent's room, parents' room and a parents‚Äô activities room. From the outside, the first area is the hallway, and through a door one you can enter the patio and the main social room. The closer and more intimate visitors are to the family, the deeper they get invited into the house. OnNe can either enter the rooms through the different doors in each of the rooms, or one can walk through the gallery in the patio, typically a part with a small roof to protect against the rain and sun.  Heritage and revival  As these houses were built with bricks and have high quality to last, are well ventilated, provide large living space as well as the rise of popularity in heritage, these houses are becoming popular again. Most of them continue as family houses and are modernized. In most cases the internal walls between the rooms are broken open to provide more space and garages and mezzanines are built to make better use of the height of the house. In some cases, the roofs are also converted in terraces to provide more open space. In some neighborhoods such as Palermo and San Telmo, these houses are also converted in offices, doctor practices, lawyer offices, fashion boutique shops, bars, and even restaurants. However, as the terrain prices rise, some owners sell their houses to be converted into high rise buildings. There are initiatives ongoing to protect this heritage.

Held between the 1905 London and 1906 Stockholm party congresses at the Tampere Workers' Hall, the conference was an unofficial meeting of the Bolshevik faction of the party. It is particularly remembered for playing host to the first meeting of Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin. The conference resolved to forgo participation in the new State Duma and its associated elections, and instead begin an armed uprising against the government of the Russian Empire, a move that eventually led to the October Revolution of 1917. The Tampere conference was conducted in secrecy, and little record remains of its proceedings. The only known documents that remain are the printed record of the resolutions reached at the meeting, and Lenin's report on its results. The exact timeframe of the conference is also unclear. Finnish sources suggest that it was held on 25‚Äì30 December, whilst according to Russian historian G. Kramolnikov, who wrote about the conference in the 1930s, it was opened earlier, with the first sessions held on 23 December. Background A solicitation for the Tampere meeting appeared in the Bolshevik Novaya Zhizn newspaper in late November 1905. It invited regional Bolshevik organisations to elect representatives to attend a conference in Finland, to be opened on 23 December. The conference was intended as a meeting of the Lenin-led Bolshevik faction of the RSDLP, which had strengthened following the 3rd party congress, held in London earlier that year. That November, the Menshevik faction held its own \\"second general conference\\" in St. Petersburg. Unrest caused by the Russian Revolution of 1905, however, prevented many Bolshevik regional organisations from sending representatives to Tampere, including those from Moscow, Samara, and Nizhny Novgorod. As such, the meeting was lowered in status from party congress to conference. Just before the conference on 21 December, the Moscow Soviet (Workers' Council), which was controlled by the Bolsheviks, decided to begin an armed rebellion. At the start of the party conference, the outcome of the rebellion was not yet known. Furthermore, the Russian government had just issued an election law for the new State Duma, which became a topic of debate at the conference. The conference was intended to be held in St. Petersburg, but this was later deemed unfeasible due to the ongoing unrest there. Finland was chosen as the new site of the conference because no passport was needed to travel there. Yrj√∂ Sirola, secretary of the Finnish Social Democratic Party, recommended the city of Tampere, as no Russian troops were stationed there. In addition, Tampere's mayor welcomed anti-Tsarist activists of all kinds, and the city was home to a powerful labour movement. Lenin initially opposed the Tampere option for the conference, but changed his mind after the general strike that took place there during the Russian Revolution of 1905. According to the announcement that appeared in Novaya Zhizn, representatives attending the conference were to meet at Finland Station in St. Petersburg on 21 December, after which they would proceed by train to Tampere in small groups. The Finnish organisers of conference are of uncertain identity. Editor of the Kansan Lehti newspaper Vihtori Kosonen has been suggested as one of them. The conference The conference was held at the five-year old Tampere Workers' Hall, which was built by the Tampere Workers' Society as a \\"People's House\\" leisure and cultural centre for the working class. The hall was considered an ideal place to hold the conference, as the sheer number of events and activities held there provided cover for covert activities. The Workers' Society offered to provide space in the hall free-of-charge, organised a guard to keep watch for the Tsarist secret police, and provided accommodation for the representatives at local hotels. Sessions of the conference began on 23 December, though it was not officially opened until the next day. Lenin was elected chairman, with Boris Goldman (known by the alias Gorev) and Mikhail Borodin (known by the alias Kiril) selected as deputy chairmen. On Lenin's suggestion, all representatives to the conference used aliases, for fear of detection by the secret police. Well-known representatives to the conference include Fyodor Dan, Leonid Krasin, Julius Martov, Alexei Rykov. Leo Laukki represented the FSDP. A total of 41 representatives of regional RSDLP organisations from across Russia attended the conference. The first order of business was the presentation of information regarding ongoing events in each region of Russia, and a discussion about the actions of the Central Committee of the RSDLP. Lenin gave at least two speeches at the conference, and these were subsequently praised by Stalin in his memoirs. The atmosphere at the conference was one of great revolutionary enthusiasm, which was lauded by Lenin's wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya. According to her, members of the Tampere Red Guards even taught the Russians how to shoot rifles. The primary issue raised at the conference was the split between the Bolshevik and Menshevik factions of the party. The Bolsheviks desired to mend the split, but would not consider compromising the Bolshevik ideology in searching for a resolution. At Tampere, they considered methods for restoring co-operation between the two factions, even if the formal split could not be resolved. In the end, the conference resolved to mend the split between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks on the basis of equality between the two factions, and issued its support for the merger of parallel Menshevik and Bolshevik regional organisations. They also considered the \\"agrarian question\\", a term used by marxists to refer to debate over whether the rural-based peasantry would support an urban-based proletarian revolution. In reference to this question, the conference voted to demand the confiscation of all private, state, and church land. Finally, the conference discussed the upcoming elections to the newly established State Duma. Most representatives at the conference considered the recently publicised State Duma election law to be a \\"travesty of parliamentarianism\\", and urged a boycott of the elections. Lenin, along with Gorev, dissented, suggesting that the election law could be exploited to the Bolsheviks' advantage, and that it was necessary to be flexible in efforts to constrain the power of the Tsar. In the face of intense opposition, Lenin abandoned this position, and endorsed the majority's call for an electoral boycott and an endorsement of the ongoing armed uprising in Moscow, which was then adopted. Another decision made at the conference was to reorganise the party into a more centralised framework, in line with Lenin's principles of democratic centralism. =Meeting of Lenin and Stalin= Lenin and Stalin's first meeting took place during the conference at a meeting room in the Tampere Workers' Hall. Stalin later wrote in his memoirs that the meeting had been at first a disappointment. He had assumed that Lenin would be a grand figure, physically bigger than everyone else present, but found instead that he was shorter than average, and looked no different from any of the other representatives present at the conference. Stalin also wrote that he thought it was customary for great men to arrive late to such functions, so as to facilitate the gathered public's waiting in anticipation. Lenin, however, arrived on time, chatting with acquaintances at a corner table, and greeting the representatives in an informal manner. Stalin wrote that, at the time, he considered this to be \\"violation of certain essential rules\\", but later realised that this \\"simplicity and modesty\\" were Lenin's greatest qualities as a leader of the \\"rank and file\\" of humanity. The room where Lenin and Stalin met is now part of the Tampere Lenin Museum. Myths surrounding the conference  A commemorative plaque on the wall of the Tampere Workers' Hall. As no minutes of the proceedings of the conference exist, nor are there any photos of the meeting itself, there is very little reliable information about what really occurred at the conference and people's memories of the event are more or less distorted. Furthermore, because the meeting was attended by figures of major historical importance, including Lenin and Stalin, numerous legends and myths have sprung up about that are not necessarily true. For example, Lenin and his wife Nadezhda Krupskaya allegedly stayed at a guest house on the corner of Rautatienkatu and Kytt√§l√§nkatu in Tampere, as indicated by a plaque commemorating this on the wall of the building. In fact, there was not yet a guest house at that location in 1905, and Lenin probably stayed at the Hotel Bauer, as did many of the other delegates. Another story describes how the Finnish journalist and activist J. E. Zidb√§ck prevented Lenin and Stalin from being arrested by the Tsarist secret police based on information he had received from Helsinki. Zidb√§ck claimed that hundreds of state police and gendarmes had already arrived in town on Christmas Eve. His version of these events, however, is inconsistent with other information; for example, Emil Viljanen, who was president of the Tampere Workers' Society at the time, did not corroborate this story. In a radio interview in 1949, Matti Vuolukka claimed that Lenin had promised Finland its independence at the conference should the Bolsheviks rise to power. It appears, however, that the promise Vuolukka is remembering took place at the second party congress in Tampere in November 1906. Furthermore, Lenin's promise likely only pertained to Finland's internal autonomy.

The aircraft involved was a Boeing 707-321C aircraft operated by Pan American World Airways. All three crew members died in the crash.  Aircraft  The Boeing 707-321C with construction number (c/n) 18824 and manufacturer serial number (msn) 397 was rolled out of Boeing's Renton, Washington factory on December 17, 1964 and two weeks later was sold to Pan American World Airways, where it received the name Clipper Racer. The four turbofan engines installed under the wing were Pratt & Whitney JT3D-3B models, with a thrust of 18,000 pounds each.  Crew  The captain was 47-year-old Arthur Moen, who had 15,207 hours of total pilot time including 3,969 hours in a Boeing 707, and had been with the airline since 1949. The first officer was 38-year-old Johannes D. Markestein, who had 9,813 hours of total pilot time, including 2,813 hours in a Boeing 707, and had been with the airline since 1957. The flight engineer was 31-year-old James R. Skellenger, who had 3,032 hours of total pilot time, including 138 hours of flight engineer time in Boeing 707s. These three crew members had not flown together before, although the captain and co-pilot had previously flown together from Anchorage, twice.  Crash  The aircraft carried out a regular postal shipment from San Francisco, California to Cam Ranh Bay, South Vietnam with intermediate stops in Anchorage, Alaska; Tokyo, Japan; and Da Nang, South Vietnam. An interim landing in Anchorage, Alaska was done for refueling and crew change. At 10:54 p.m.Alaska Time Zone, Flight 799 took off from San Francisco to Anchorage, and the flight initially took place without any problems. However, since Anchorage Airport was closed due to weather conditions, Captain Moen had to land at nearby Elmendorf Air Force Base, as planned ahead of time. The crew noted that there were problems with the No. 4 engine's thrust-reverser. Flight 799 was delayed in leaving Elmendorf for two hours. Eventually, at 5:55 a.m., Captain Moen started the engines, and, at 6:02 a.m., the craft was allowed to taxi to the runway: Air Traffic Control gave permission to proceed to Runway 5, but the crew requested Runway 23, as the latter had greater effective length. When the crew were offered a \\"follow me\\" truck due to lack of knowledge of the facility, they were pre-occupied with the taxi checklist. Captain Moen had not re-lowered the flaps after raising them to prevent icing, during which time First Officer Markestein remarked \\"Okay, let's not forget them.\\" As Flight 799 reached the runway's end thanks to the \\"follow me\\" truck guiding them there, two Air Force flights took off before them, and then Flight 799 was cleared for takeoff at 6:15 a.m. Take-off would be performed by First Officer Markestein, and he proceeded to power up all four engines. Immediately after the plane left the ground, the cockpit stick shaker began to vibrate, a safety feature to alert pilots of imminent aerodynamic stall. The aircraft then banked to the right, the right wing touched the ground, and the plane crashed 59.2 seconds after takeoff just beyond Runway 23, exploding from ground impact and being consumed by explosion and fire. All three crew members were killed upon impact.  Investigation  The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) came to the conclusion that probable causes of the crash were (a) a defective checklist, (b) the 707's defective takeoff warning hardware, (c) ineffective implementation of Boeing's Service Bulletins, and (d) stress caused by a rushed flight schedule. The immediate mechanical cause was takeoff with flaps retracted, leading to loss of attitudinal control and altitude. NTSB discovered that a lower-flaps item appeared only on the taxi checklist, and was not included in the pre-takeoff checklist (which comes after the taxi checklist) so that it could remind the pilots that flaps must be lowered to ensure safe takeoff. The Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) showed that First Officer Markestein lowered flaps during initial reading of the taxi checklist, but Captain Moen then retracted flaps, initially without Markestein's knowledge, in accordance with Pan Am's cold weather operating procedures to prevent icing. Markestein was made aware of Moen's flaps retraction only during the taxi checklist's second reading, but neither officer remembered to revisit flaps, that item being absent from the pre-takeoff checklist. Any time a 707's flaps aren't extended (lowered) for takeoff, upon the crew applying thrust, the takeoff warning system should sound an audible warning signal (horn), but this didn't happen on flight 799, because Pan American had failed to implement Boeing's January 31, 1967 Service Bulletin 2384 recommending the warning system's throttle actuation point be reduced from 42 degrees of thrust-lever advancement to 25 degrees in order to work correctly in cold-weather conditions (where very cold air provides greater lift, as was the case with flight 799, hence less need for thrust): Pan Am's operations engineering group had decided (incorrectly) that Boeing's service bulletin was inapplicable to Pan Am aircraft, for reasons they never documented. The NTSB recommended that checklists be revised so that items critical for safe flight be accomplished prior to takeoff, and that Boeing Service Bulletin No. 2384 be immediately made mandatory via an FAA airworthiness directive. FAA (belatedly) issued the requested airworthiness directive five months later, on May 28, 1969.  Consequences  Flight 799 was one of a series of aircraft losses resulting proximately from failures in checklist design and implementation. Unfortunately, it took 18 years for NTSB's recommendation in the 1969 crash report that \\"Air carrier cockpit checklists to be reviewed in an effort to ensure that each list provides a means of reminding the crew, immediately prior to takeoff, that all items critical for safe flight have been accomplished\\" to be implemented. After the August 16, 1987 loss of Northwest Airlines Flight 255 for similar reasons, NTSB recommended that Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) convene a human- performance research group to determine ‚Äú...if there is any type or method of presenting a checklist [that] produces better performance on part of user personnel,‚Äù and for the FAA to recommend checklist typography criteria for commercial operators. In due course, these recommendations led to a sea change in checklist design and implementation, incorporating human-factors research and Crew resource management into cockpit management.

It is a reconstruction of a home dating from the First Spanish Period (1565-1763) that stood on this site.  History  The S√°nchez de Ortigosa House shows up on city maps in 1763 and 1765 as being a stone building belonging to Jos√© S√°nchez de Ortigosa. S√°nchez de Ortigosa was from Ronda, Spain. He married a local woman, Juana Theodora P√©rez, with whom he had nine children. He was a privateer. By 1788, during Florida's British Period (1763-1783), the stone house had been razed and a wooden house stood in its place. Restoration Commission Director Earle Newton stated that First Spanish Period homes did not last because the English tended to tear them down for use of the building materials and replace them with wooden structures.  Restoration  The St. Augustine Historic Restoration and Preservation Commission (later the Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board) completed a reconstruction of the S√°nchez de Ortigosa house in 1966. It was built as a one-story pink house on the corners of St. George Street and Cuna Street. The roof was built of tile and cement. Additional funding for this reconstruction was donated by Edward Ball of Jacksonville.  San Agust√≠n Antiguo  During the time of the living history museum San Agust√≠n Antiguo in St. Augustine, the S√°nchez de Ortigosa house served as a First Spanish Period carpenter's shop. Antiques were repaired there and custom pieces were made for exhibition houses and for public sale. Earl Shugart made woodwork and furnishings there for the restoration area. The Preservation Board also had a contract to construct furniture for the Southern Bell Telephone Company building to go up on Charlotte Street. Kjell Lunestad was a Norwegian wood carver and cabinet maker who was hired in 1968 who also worked at the S√°nchez de Ortigosa shop. He made items such as monk's benches and hope chests. He used no nails, but rather fitted white pine and fir together without.  Present Day  Today this site is retail space, operated by the Spanish Dutch Convoy.

It brought together some 200 delegates from over 20 countries. Zionism was a prominent topic, while emigration to Palestine for Jewish refugees was discussed and strongly supported. Anitta M√ºller-Cohen, congress organizer Background Interest in international activities grew out of the National Council of Jewish Women (NCJW) which was established in the United States at the end of the 19th century. It was followed by Jewish women's organizations in England and Germany. There was renewed interest after the end of World War I when delegates of the NCJW were sent to Europe to investigate the situation there. It was therefore decided to bring together Jewish women from many different countries to a conference in May 1923 where they could \\"consider problems created by the war and lay constructive plans for working together\\". Conference Rebekah Kohut, congress chair Supported by the Council of Jewish Women, local preparations for the congress were ensured above all by Anitta M√ºller-Cohen. Chaired by the Hungarian-born American Rebekah Kohut, the Vienna congress brought together delegates from over 20 countries. Held in the impressive premises of the Hofburg, the opening session was also attended by many illustrious local figures, including the Austrian president Michael Hainisch, the mayor of Vienna, the chief of police, as well as writers and politicians. Subsequent sessions were held in the Commerce Association's building (im Gro√üen Saal des Kaufm√§nnischen Gremiums). =Speakers= Among the speakers at the congress's opening session were Marianne Hainisch, founder of the Austrian women's movement; Zwi Perez Chajes, chief rabbi of Vienna; Regine Ulmann and Anitta M√ºller-Cohen from the women's movement; and Alois Pick, president of Vienna's Israelite Community. Speakers spoke in their own languages, mainly German and English but occasionally also French and Italian. Where necessary, interpretation was provided. Speaking on behalf of Vienna's Sephardic Community, Mazal Ovadia spoke in Hebrew, receiving wide acclaim. There were some 200 congress delegates from Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, the Free City of Danzig, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Mandatory Palestine, Poland, Romania, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Representing international Jewish organizations, there were also women from Russia and the Ukraine. =Topics= The five main topics discussed over the conference's six day programme included \\"the duties of the Jewish woman within the community, the problem of refugees and orphans, the situation of homeless girls, aid for emigration, and support for Palestine.\\" There was lengthy discussion of how Palestine could serve as a sanctuary for European refugees who wished to relocate. Among the speakers on the first days were Roza Pomerantz-Meltzer from Poland on grants for Jewish schools, Bertha Pappenheim from Austria on the need to protect Jewish girls from prostitution, and Dr. Korolik from Russia on the dreadful treatment of Jewish children in Russia. The discussions revealed the disastrous consequences for refugees and orphans who had been rendered homeless as a result of pogroms and persecution. When representatives from Eastern Europe described the fate of Jews in Russia and the Ukraine, the effects on the participants were so distressing that the proceedings had to be interrupted for a few minutes. While there was no support for political action, it was suggested that, in line with the Balfour Declaration, Zionism could serve as a practical means of dealing with the suffering experienced by the Jews. There was unanimous agreement on the need for support to Palestine. In the words of one of the final congress resolutions: \\"It appears, therefore, to be the duty of all Jews to co-operate in the social-economic reconstruction of Palestine and to assist in the settlement of Jews in that country.\\" Second congress A second World Congress of Jewish Women was held in Hamburg, Germany, from 3 to 6 June 1929.

The explanation was that the majority of glycogen is made from a number of substances other than glucose. The glucose paradox was first formulated by biochemists J. Denis McGarry and Joseph Katz in 1984. The glucose paradox demonstrates the importance of the chemical compound lactate in the biochemical process of carbohydrate metabolism. The paradox is that the large amount of glycogen (10%) found in the liver cannot be explained by the liver's small absorption of glucose. After the body's digestion of carbohydrates and the entering the circulatory system in the form of glucose, some will be absorbed directly into the muscle tissue and will be converted into lactic acid throughout the anaerobic energy system, rather than going directly to the liver and being converted into glycogen. The lactate is then taken and converted by the liver, forming the material for liver glycogen. The majority of the body's liver glycogen is produced indirectly, rather than directly from glucose in the blood. Under normal physiological conditions, glucose is a poor precursor compound and use by the liver is limited.

In the 1833 debate, Lewis Williams and John M. Patton vocally opposed the restriction. A ban on hoods was added to the rule in 2012.  Proposed repeal  Bella Abzug tried to wear her signature brimmed hat after her election in 1971, but was forced to remove it by the House doorkeeper. The rule was unsuccessfully challenged by Frederica Wilson in 2010, known for her embrace of a variety of hats (including \\"sequined cowboy hats\\") as a fashion item, and the issue was raised of a dress code with adverse impact on women in government. A partial repeal to allow religious accommodation was proposed in 2018 with the election of Ilhan Omar, to allow the Islamic hijab as well as the Jewish kippah and Sikh dastar. The new rule has been co-authored by Ilhan Omar with Nancy Pelosi and Jim McGovern, and is being supported by religious groups including the Orthodox Jewish bodies Orthodox Union and Agudath Israel. A medical exception will also be added for members who are undergoing chemotherapy. On January 9, 2019 the rules were amended to permit religious headwear., ¬ß102(x) References Ban on head covering Ban on head covering Ban on head covering Clothing controversies Ban on head covering ","title":"United States House of Representatives ban on head covering"},{"id":"59105457","text":"State Road 262 (NM 262) is a state highway in the US state of New Mexico.

Designed by architect and Liverpool City Surveyor Thomas Shelmerdine and constructed in 1896, it remained in use as a library until 1999. It was used by community groups for a few years but it has been derelict for 12 years. There are plans in progress to convert the building for use as an arts, culture, heritage and enterprise centre. In September 2019, it was named on the Victorian Society's list of the top ten most endangered buildings in England and Wales. History Upon its opening in 1896 it was one of the earliest public libraries in Liverpool. It is Grade II listed on account of its architectural quality and its role in the development of Liverpool's public library service. It was given listed status in July 1966. The building suffered severe vandalism during 2009 and emergency works had to be carried out to limit the damage caused by theft of rainwater goods and smashing of rooflights. Architecture Built from brick and stone with a tiled roof, the building is built in a Jacobean/Arts and Crafts style and has an ornamental corner turret. The interior has decorative iron railings to balconies with circular iron stairs. It has a barrel shaped roof of glass panels over the main hall and shallow domed lights over a centre part. The Beacon Lane corner has squat octagon with 4 columns, iron gates, ornamented stone panels, upper windows, and concave sided turret short spire. Redevelopment Plans for redeveloping the building as a cultural hub were proposed in 2014 but were put on hold due to finances. Plans were restarted in 2016 with a proposal to turn the building into an arts, culture, heritage and enterprise centre but nothing came to fruition. In November 2018 it was announced that a local property and hotel group were interested in restoring the building for use as a youth centre and community hub. Liverpool City Council estimated that it could cost ¬£5 million to restore the building.

An attending physician at the hospital, a police officer, and a pharmacy resident were killed. The gunman, later identified as Juan Lopez, the ex-fianc√© of one of the victims, later died in a shootout with other responding officers. Incident The incident occurred between The incident began in the parking lot of the hospital before moving inside. Police told the media that a verbal argument in the parking lot between an emergency room doctor and her ex-fianc√© escalated. The doctor, identified as Tamara O'Neal, 38, was killed by the gunman in the parking lot. An eyewitness claimed that O'Neal ran over to the group for help, and was on her phone attempting to call 9-1-1, and told them that the gunman would kill her. The witness also claimed that the gunman demanded a ring from O'Neal, and returned with a gun and shot her six times when it emerged she did not have the ring. Local officers have classified the killing of O'Neal as domestic violence. He continued into the hospital and shot others. Police arrived and exchanged fire with the gunman, who retreated into the hospital and was pursued by officers. The gunman fired about 40 shots during the shooting. A police officer was transported to the University of Chicago Medical Center in critical condition, where he later died. He was identified as 28-year-old Samuel Jimenez.

In 2014, during a separation proceedings, Lopez's wife at the time filed a petition for an order of protection against him, alleging threats and harassment by Lopez, as well as Lopez's unsafe and threatening conduct with a gun. Response The hashtag #ThisIsOurLane was seen on social media after the shooting with multiple medical professionals rallying for support for those in the hospital, and some echoed anti-gun sentiments as well.

CTR's mission is to support U.S military war resisters, including helping them with legal fees such as well-known resisters Chelsea Manning and Reality Winner. In 2018, CTR began encouraging soldiers to resist at detention camps and other immigrant operations of the U.S. military. CTR's principle slogans are ‚ÄúSupporting the troops who refuse to fight!‚Äù and \\"Towards a World Without War!\\" They support those ‚Äúwho face consequences for acting on conscience, in opposition to illegal wars, occupations, [and] the policies of empire‚Äù.  Founding  The Iraq War began amid controversy of Iraq's possessing ‚Äúweapons of mass destruction‚Äù. According to French academic Dominique Reyni√©, between 3 January and 12 April 2003, people globally took part in almost 3,000 protests against war in Iraq, with demonstrations on 15 February 2003 being the largest. Resistance also occurred in the U.S. military. On April 1, 2003 Stephen E. Funk, a U.S. Marine Corps Lance Corporal Reservist held a press conference outside the Camp Pendleton Marine Base in Oceanside, CA publicly announcing his refusal to participate in the war. Like minded civilians and veterans of earlier wars stepped forward to support Funk. As other soldiers refused orders and faced courts-martial, a broader support organization was needed for their defense. Courage to Resist was formed to help fill that need.  Jeff Paterson  Marine Corporal Jeff Paterson refused to board military aircraft in Hawaii en route to Persian Gulf on August 7, 1990. One of Funk's early supporters was Jeff Paterson, a former Marine who was the first soldier to publicly refuse orders to the 1st Iraq War in 1990. Paterson had been a Marine for five years and was on the verge of returning to civilian life when his discharge was cancelled in lieu of orders for deployment to the Persian Gulf. On August 7, 1990, as his unit boarded an aircraft in Hawaii, he sat down on the tarmac and refused to move. A week later he held a press conference where he stated, ‚ÄúI will not be a pawn in America‚Äôs power plays for profit and oil in the Middle East‚Äù. Paterson was a CTR founding member and has served for many years as the Project Director.  Opposition to the Iraq War  CTR supported several early and later public resisters to the Iraq War, including Army Staff Sergeants Camilo Mejia and Kevin Benderman, Navy Petty Officer Pablo Paredes, Army medic Agustin Aguayo, Private First Class Robin Long, and Army First Lieutenant Ehren Watada. CTR support was in the form of funding public support and legal defense, staging rallies near military bases where resisters were being court martialed and at military recruiting stations, and participated in national days of actions to oppose the Iraq War and support resisters. Opposition to the War in Afghanistan  CTR supported the earliest public resisters to the War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) including Victor Agosto and Travis Bishop.  Israeli War Resisters Support  CTR members traveled to Israel and Palestine to meet with former Israeli soldiers about their experiences ‚Äúcarrying out acts of brutality and occupation‚Äù and decided to support resistance to the Israeli military. In 2008 they were instrumental in issuing a statement signed by 26 U.S. military soldiers and veterans who refused to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan, which supported Israeli Shministim (Hebrew for ‚Äú12th graders‚Äù) who were also resisting military service. In 2018 they supported Tamar Ze‚Äôevi, a 15-year-old who spent 115 days in jail for refusing to enlist in the Israeli army.  Chelsea Manning Support  Activists March for Bradley Manning at the 2011 San Francisco Pride Parade.In April 2010 a video showing a U.S. helicopter attack in Baghdad that killed eleven unarmed Iraqi civilians, including two Reuters employees, and seriously wounded two children was released by WikiLeaks and quickly spread via the Internet and news media. On May 27, 2010, Chelsea Manning was arrested and charged with espionage and ‚Äúaiding the enemy‚Äù. Within days of Manning's arrest, CTR joined with others to defend her and help raise money for her defense. On August 21, 2013 she was sentenced 35 years in prison, reduction in rank to private, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and a dishonorable discharge. This was the longest sentence ever given to a whistleblower and was widely criticized.Bradley Manning: a sentence both unjust and unfair, The Guardian, August 21, 2013.Bradley Manning‚Äôs Excessive Sentence The New York Times, August 21, 2013. Throughout the trial and the 7 years Manning served in Leavenworth prison, CTR defended her and provided financial support through the Chelsea Manning Support Network. Manning's lead defense attorney, David Coombs, credited CTR directly for her early release: ‚ÄúIf not for the efforts of Jeff Paterson and the Manning Support Network and Courage to Resist, there‚Äôs no way that a president would spend the political capital to grant a commutation‚Äù. Manning said on the NBC Today show that she \\"would especially like to thank Courage to Resist and the Bradley Manning Support Network for their tireless efforts in raising awareness for my case and providing for my legal representation.\\"  Counter-Recruiting  CTR focuses some of its efforts to counter U.S. military recruiting, including the efforts of the military to influence and recruit youth. CTR organized a demonstration and vigils outside military recruiting centers, and on one occasion, forced a Marine recruiting center to close for several hours. They use materials such as those produced by the Stop Recruiting Kids campaign.  Reality Winner Support  Reality Winner, a former U.S. Air Force intelligence specialist and military contractor, was arrested on June 3, 2017 and charged under the Espionage Act with leaking a National Security Agency report about Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections to the news website The Intercept. After her arrest, CTR began a campaign demanding the charges against her be dropped. CTR coordinated the formation of the Stand With Reality support committee that noted ‚Äúthe charge against Winner is grossly disproportionate to her alleged offense, and is designed to create a chilling effect on investigative journalism by dissuading sources from sharing information that is critical to the public interest.‚Äù On August 23, 2018 Winner received a sentence of 5 Years in prison. Since her conviction, CTR has joined with others to call for Winner's pardon or the commuting of her sentence to time served.  Immigrants  CTR's most recent campaign opposes the use of U.S. military personnel in immigrant detention camps and on U.S. borders. CTR produced materials encouraging soldiers to resist the ‚Äúillegal‚Äù orders in relation to immigration and they support GIs who have publicly resisted. For example, they support U.S. Army Captain Brittany DeBarros's uses social media and public statements to voice her opposition to the military's immigrant related deployments. She stated, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt take an oath to defend illegal war abroad and immigrant concentration camps at home.

Rather than distancing himself from the scandal-ridden LDPR party member Andrey Lugovoy, who was wanted by Scotland Yard for murder, Zhirinovsky intentionally sought to be photographed beside him.  Platform  Zhirinovsky took rather extreme positions on many issues. For instance, he proposed a locking down and closing all of Russia's borders immediately after the election.

The newspaper's circulation is an estimated 2,150 copies. The Dundee Observer is owned by Finger Lakes Media., Inc. and published by George Lawson. The Dundee Observer belongs to both the National Newspaper Association as well as the New York Press Association.  History  The newspaper was founded on June 20, 1878. In 1998, George Lawson bought the newspaper alongside the Watkins Glenn Review and Express. Subsequent to Lawson's purchase, the newspaper's coverage broadened and the company opened up buildings in two locations, Dundee and Penn Yan. The business and success of the Dundee Observer forced its one time competitor, the Dundee Record, to pick up and move to Corning, New York. A total of nine employees work for the newspaper. Mr. Lawson, the publisher, runs the business. His wife, Debra, is currently employed as the business manager of the Dundee Observer and the Watkins Glenn Review and Express. Lawson's son, Brandon, works as the newspaper's primary photographer and was also quintessential to the creation of the Dundee Observer's online website. Additional members of the newspaper include Rikki Marcin, who has worked for the newspaper since Lawson took over in 1998. Clara Pinckney has been a reporter for the newspaper since 1973. Furthermore, historian Barbara Hope Smith Bell started to write for the Dundee Observer in 1952, and in 2003 she established a section of the paper devoted to neighborhood history. Artist and one time Dundee resident George Rhoads produced comic strips for the paper such as that of \\"Big Mouse,\\" a cartoon rodent. The newspaper's yearly revenue intake is reported to be less than $500,000.  Coverage  For over 140 years, the newspaper has provided Yates county readers local coverage on numerous topics including reports on criminal activity, economic growth, weddings, and fatalities. The newspaper also offers coverage of nearby high school sports teams and town politics. Each issue also includes several advertisements and removable coupons from local grocers and businesses. On June 24, 1881, the Dundee Observer reported on a fire that spread through the city streets causing $25,000 in damages. Among the notable Dundee buildings to be consumed by the fire was the Dundee Opera House. Local assemblyman Phil Palmesano describes the Dundee Observer's local reporting as a tremendous cornerstone to many community residents. He declares that many \\"look forward to reading the weekly edition of The [Dundee] Observer for important news and information to help let [us] know what's happening right here.\\" Throughout the years, however, the Dundee Observer has also touched on national news. For example, in 1942, the paper published a letter from the perspective of a former conscientious objector who now believed that it was his responsibility join the United States war effort.  Awards  In the National Newspaper Association's \\"2016 Better Newspaper Editorial Contest\\" the Dundee Observer took home a number of distinctions.

Development With the failure of the 1915 and 1916 bomber contests to produce any usable types to replace the Voisin V, Voisin was asked to produce an interim type pending the development of the next generation of bombers. This was based partly on the preceding Voisin VII which was itself an enlarged V, but was to be powered by a larger engine as the VII was found to be underpowered,Davilla, p.557 and would dispense with the nose radiator, reverting to drag-inducing side radiators. Two versions were to be built, a conventional bomber, and an aircraft armed with a large single shot 37mm Hotchkiss cannon as was used on the Voisin IV. Initially it was thought the cannon would be used for air-air attacks and was officially designated a cannon fighter (Ca.2) however this was found to be unworkable as both bomber and fighter types were vulnerable to fighters as they were too slow and unmaneuverable but at least one enemy aircraft was destroyed -- with a single shot. As a result, a variety of other roles were attempted with it. Flying artillery, using indirect shots were impossible to aim accurately, balloon busting highlighted the type's vulnerability to anti-aircraft artillery fire, but some success was found with used in the ground attack firing directly at the target. Many had their cannons removed while in operational service but at least one was armed with additional machine guns. The LBP with the cannon had the pilot in the rear seat, while in the LAP, the pilot sat in the front seat, while the rear occupant could be equipped with a light machine gun such as a Lewis. On some aircraft, the observer's gun was mounted on a ring that was tilted to make movement forward easier against the wind. Unlike with the Voisin IV, installation of the cannon did not require that the top wing be staggered forward to maintain fore-aft balance. Like the previous Voisins going back to the Voisin III, the Voisin VIII had a steel tube structure to provide adequate strength. Unusually for the period, and because it had no skid to drag it to a stop, it was equipped with drum brakes. These were fitted to the rear wheels.

In 2013 and 2014, she was included in the BBC's 100 Women. In 2018, she founded Aid Access, which operates in the United States. A trained abortion specialist and activist, she is generally considered the first abortion rights activist to cross international borders. Gomperts was included in Time magazine 's 100 Most Influential People in 2020.  Early life  Rebecca Gomperts was born in 1966 in Paramaribo in Suriname. She moved to Netherlands at the age of three and grew up in the harbor town of Vlissingen. Her movements around Europe at an early age inbred international consciousness in her that would drive her future career. Gomperts moved to Amsterdam in the mid 1980s after high school. Having an interest for both the arts and sciences, Gomperts studied visual arts and medicine. She completed a four-year art degree at Amsterdam's Rietveld Academy studying conceptual art, while at the same time attending medical school. As she found that art was not the path she wanted to follow, she dived into the world of medicine; Gomperts did not find her calling in the field of reproductive medicine until later on in her medical career.  Career = Early career = After graduating from medical school, Gompert worked in a small hospital in Guiana as a trainee doctor. This is where 25-year-old she witnessed the realities of illegal abortions for the first time. As of 1997 she was a 31-year old doctor based in Amsterdam who performed legal abortions. Between 1997-1998, Gomperts sailed with a Greenpeace ship called the Rainbow Warrior II as a resident doctor and environmental activist. She sailed through Latin America, visiting Romani and Guinea. = Idea for change = After her travels with Greenpeace, Gomperts' interest in reproductive health increased. Gomperts wanted the health damages and death rates from at-home abortions to decline, so she designed a program on the radical idea that women can do abortions and get abortions done where abortion clinics are highly restricted or don't exist at all. Gomperts used contacts she had made during art school to help her design and fund a mobile clinic. A close friend of hers, Joep van Lieshout, agreed to help design the clinic. The collaborative idea was for the clinic to be a functional work of art, a mobile clinic aboard a ship, so that it could legally pass through international borders without the medical equipment being seized. Gomperts applied for funds from the , needing $500,000 in medical equipment, and $190,000 total in seed capital. The grant for the mobile clinic came from the Mondriaan Foundation. Gomperts background in art was allowing her to put her dream into action, and her mobile clinic became ‚Äúa space for fusion of work that is symbolic with work that is social.‚Äù = Women on Waves = Gompets formed her organization Women on Waves in 1999, after she got back from her voyage on the Rainbow Warrior II. Women on Waves was bringing non-surgical abortion services and education to countries all around the world that didn't have them. The Women on Waves mission transcends the boundaries between law, medicine, seafaring and art. Using the grant from the Mondriaan Foundation, Women on Waves rent a boat on which the mobile clinic would be held. Many media outlets were shocked that Gomperts was not at all concerned with her ship being detained, impounded or sunk when entering a nations' waters. Women on Waves made many voyages. News spread quickly that she was trying to reach countries where abortion was illegal through their waters, and many of these countries put up incredible measures to stop her. The first voyage was to Ireland, then following was Poland, Portugal, Spain, Morocco and Guatemala. Although her first eleven-day trip to Dublin was deemed unsuccessful by the media, Women On Waves had received over 200 abortion requests from women ashore who needed their help, which was more attention than Gomperts had ever imagined. Women on Waves was never intended on solving the problem of unsafe abortions, but to help create legal precedent in the grey areas of countries abortion laws, to reach all those women who had been refused help by their own doctors and physicians, and to prevent the dangerous act of illegal abortions. = Women on Web = Women on Waves faced many challenges during the voyages. On one of her trips to Portugal, her mobile clinic was not allowed to dock. Gomperts appeared on a Portuguese talk show instead. She talked about how woman could do a safe abortion by themselves at home, how to get and take the pills, and all other medical advice she could say on air. This is when Gomperts realized that she could reach more people through the internet than in a boat. ‚ÄúIn the end our ship will never be a structural solution for the enormous number of women who need abortions,‚Äù says Gomperts. This is when in 2005, Gomperts' second organization Women on Web was founded. In 2016 Women on Web was receiving over 10,000 emails a month from over 123 countries across the world. Women could ask questions that ranged from how to administer abortion pills, to advice on contraceptives, to even relationship consulting. Instead of delivering abortion pills from the sea, Women on Web uses packages and drones to send pills and instructions for safe, at-home abortions.  Personal life  Gompert has two children and lives in Amsterdam.  Popular culture  Vessel, a documentary about Gomperts' mission of Women on Waves premiered in 2014 at the Southwest Film Festival. This documentary witnesses the creation of a network of reproductive health activists lead by Gomperts. It shows their work on global reproductive rights, and the conceptual idea of trusting women to handle their own abortions. The story of transforming a widely improbable idea into a global movement is a moving picture that captured Gomperts' legacy entirely. Women on Web also had an ad campaign advertising their services through Diesel, one of the most famous saying \\"Say Goodbye to Coat Hangers,\\" a common tool used for at-home illegal abortions. These ads had a very important secret component of a barcode hidden in plain site of the photography. If scanned, the barcodes on the T-shirts of the models give information on the abortion pill right to the viewers cellphone. This was an innovative way to advertise such an important message without stirring the pot of what is appropriate in public media.  Feminist art activism  Gomperts is now arguably the abortion right movements first extremist. Although Gomperts moved away from art, her legacy lives in feminist art activism. Art is configured as a space apart from all else, that provides activism in a safe space. Gomperts WoW projects don't combine art and activism so much as they intentionally play on their vague separation. = A-Portable = The mobile clinic that Joep van Lieshout (founder of Atelier van Lieshout) designed was called the A-Portable. This functional and comforting space was a collaborative effort between Gomperts and Van Lieshout. They put a feminist spin on Gomperts' original inspiration of the activism on the Rainbow Warrior II. Designed by an artist and funded by an artistic foundation, the A-Portable was labelled a functional work of art. This meant that whenever a transport ministry tried to confiscate the container on national waters, the certification of the A-Portable being a sculpture, made its border crossing legal. = Art exhibitions = After Women on Waves gained some international recognition, they began to participate in art exhibitions around the world. Art shows were just another campaign to create public awareness in different forms. The A-Portable was exhibited in the 49th Venice Biennale in 2001. Being a key work in the exhibition, it was presented on a raft, floating just out in the waters at the Arsenale. There were four other exhibitions in 2001 where Gomperts collaborated with Willem Velthoven. These four installations, Portrait Collector, Sea, I Had An Abortion and Every 6 Minutes were presented in the Mediamatic Women on Waves show. Portrait Collector was a collection of internet kiosks where viewers who had had abortions could photograph themselves and become part of the exhibition. Gomperts was trying to exhibit how often abortions occur, and how they can be done to almost anyone. Sea was also an interactive narrative composed of shots of the sea taken on Women on Waves' first exhibition to Ireland. Its audio component was a poetic work of voices of women asking Women on Waves for help. I Had An Abortion was hanging wire coat hangers with vests hung on them, each vest had ‚ÄúI Had An Abortion‚Äù written on it in all European languages. The final installation, Every 6 Minutes, had a very simple message. Every six minutes a red lamp flashes, symbolizing the statistic that every six minutes a women dies from an illegal abortion. On July 12, 2003 the Mediamatic Supermarket entrance was blocked with the A-Portable. This interactive exhibition presented by Mediamatic was their final installation of their Women On Waves exhibition. It allowed viewers to walk into the portable container that was transformed into an abortion clinic and sailed across international waters.

Biography Old Ghazni City in the Ghazni province of Afghanistan Abdullah Ghaznavi was born in 1811 in the Afghan city of Ghazni. He was given the name Muhammad A'zam at birth but later changed it to Abdullah. After studying with local scholars, he moved to Qandahar to study under the eminent scholar Allamah Habibullah Qandahari and returned to Ghazni after completing his studies.\\"The Ghaznawi family\\", Umm-Ul-Qura Publications In his youth, Ghaznavi was particularly inspired by the teachings of the Indian Muslim revivalists Sayyid Ahmad Barailwi and his companion Shah Isma'il Dehlawi, having read Shah Ismail's theological work Taqwƒ´yyat al-ƒ´mƒÅn (Strengthening of Faith).Christine Noelle (1995) ‚ÄòThe Anti-Wahhabƒ´ Reaction in Nineteenth-Century Afghanistan‚Äô The Muslim World, 85 (1‚Äê2): 46 During this period in Afghanistan, Sayyid Ahmad's Ahl-i Hadith followers in neighbouring India were widely, often polemically, associated with the Arabian Wahhabi movement on account of their doctrines and in the context of the Wahhabis' potential for political subversion, something which led Ghaznavi to become a persona non grata in his native country.Christine Noelle (1995) ‚ÄòThe Anti- Wahhabƒ´ Reaction in Nineteenth-Century Afghanistan‚Äô The Muslim World, 85 (1‚Äê2): 46 Ghaznavi subsequently traveled to Delhi with two companions to study Hadith under the distinguished scholar Sayyid Nazir Husain Dehlawi. He had not completed his studies, however, when the Indian Rebellion of 1857 broke out. Ghaznavi left Delhi and returned to Afghanistan during the conflict.\\"The Ghaznawi family\\", Umm-Ul-Qura Publications Having adopted a reformist and puritanical orientation, he began preaching openly against perceived religious innovations (bid'ah) and against blind adherence (taqlid) to the prevailing Hanafi school. The traditional Afghan scholars issued a fatwa declaring him to be a kafir (disbeliever) and complained against him to the ruler, Amir Dost Mohammad Khan, who ordered Ghaznavi to be exiled.\\"The Ghaznawi family\\", Umm- Ul-Qura Publications During the next fifteen years, Ghaznavi traveled to various places throughout north-western India with his family and pupils facing much hostility on account of his teachings wherever he went. Within this period he returned to Ghazni three times and was expelled each time.\\"The Ghaznawi family\\", Umm-Ul-Qura Publications On the last occasion, he was beaten and then jailed for two years before being exiled. Upon his release and final expulsion from Afghanistan, Ghaznavi migrated to the Punjab and settled in Amritsar. When he came to that city, however, some of its people started rumors that he was a Wahhabi and this aroused the suspicion of the local British administration. He, therefore, shifted his residence to the nearby village of Khayrdi where he taught in peace. In Amritsar, he eventually established a school, the Madrasah Al-Ghaznawiyah and became an influential representative of the Ahl-i Hadith movement in the area.Christine Noelle (1995) ‚ÄòThe Anti-Wahhabƒ´ Reaction in Nineteenth-Century Afghanistan‚Äô The Muslim World, 85 (1‚Äê2): 46 As his popularity grew, further centres of learning were established in Delhi, Bhopal and Patna.\\"The Ghaznawi family\\", Umm-Ul-Qura Publications Abdullah Ghaznavi had fifteen daughters and twelve sons many of whom continued his reformist work.

Department store Branches were established in Truro, Nova Scotia 1929 and in Antigonish, Nova Scotia in 1932 . By 1931 Harry and Sol Goodman took over the Nova Scotia operation leaving the Vinebergs to continue with a retail business which by that time operated stores in Montr√©al and Ottawa under the name Larocque.

The third floor of the building operated as a public auditorium. During the second world war Goodman Auditorium as it was called served as an armoury and drill hall. In 1988 the New Glasgow structures were re-purposed into a shopping centre by Antigonish entrepreneur Brian MacLeod and local lawyers Richard Goodman Q.C., and Gregory MacDonald Q.C. whose firm became occupants on the second floor.

He was President of the National Assembly, which ratified the 1878 Treaty of Berlin proclaiming Serbia's independence. He was a liberal-minded philosopher and politician who believed that the rule of force was unacceptable and that governments should promote and support popular education.Daskalov 2013, p. 112 A prominent lawyer, writer and translator, he helped organized the college's law school; a prominent statesman, he secured major reforms in education. Matiƒá was a tireless worker who dedicated his life to the creation of modern Serbia.Serbian Studies 2010, p. 341  Early life and Education  Dimitrije Matiƒá was born in 1821 in Ruma, Kingdom of Slavonia, a province of the Habsburg Monarchy within the Austrian Empire. His father, Iliya Matiƒá, is said to have participated in the wars against Napoleon. His mother Spasenija was the aunt of Vladimir Jovanoviƒá. Dimitrije Matiƒá had three brothers Matej, Miloje, and Djordje.Matiƒá completed elementary school in Ruma, secondary school in Sremski Karlovci before moving to the Principality of Serbia.Milenko 1987, p. 1 He first attended Military School then after being offered a scholarship entered the newly-founded Lyceum. The teachers had been trained abroad in Austria, Switzerland, and France and the classes were taught in Latin and German. In the summer of 1840, Matiƒá completed his cursus of Philosophy then a year later his Legal Studies. The same year he moved to Belgrade joining his older brother Matej, who works as a clerk in the office of Prince Mihailo Obrenoviƒá, and entered the civil service. After the Skup≈°tina elected Alexander Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá there is a shift of dynasty and Mihailo Obrenoviƒá is deposed, Matiƒá left the country with the Prince; during that time Matiƒá lived in the Vrdnik Monastery on Fru≈°ka Gora mountain returning in 1843. On his return, he starts working as a lawyer and becomes secretary of Captain Mi≈°a Anastasijeviƒá.322x322px Matiƒá received a post-graduate scholarship from the government to study Philosophy in Berlin and Law in Heidelberg.Ljusiƒá 2005, p. 14. In 1847 he received his Ph.D. degree in Philosophy at the University of Leipzig. His doctoral thesis was called: Dissertatio de via qua Fichtii, Schellingii, Hegeliique philosophia e speculativa investigatione Kantiana exculta sit; it addressed the question of how the philosophy of Fichte, Schelling and Hegel developed from Immanuel Kant's speculative thought. Among his professors in Berlin were Hegel's successor Georg Andreas Gabler (1786-1853), Otto Friedrich Gruppe and Johann Karl Wilhelm Vatke. He was mostly influenced by his Berlin professor Karl Ludwig Michelet, with whom he established a lifelong correspondence. While getting his Law degree in Heidelberg he also studied Political Economy under Karl Heinrich Rau.American Contributions: History, edited by Anna Cienciala Ladislav Matejka, Victor Terras, Anna M. Cienciala Mouton, 1973 After obtaining the approval of the Ministry of Education, he left Heidelberg for Paris to extend his law studies.Rudiƒá 2016, p. 127. During the uprising of the Serbs against the force of Hungary, Matiƒá was a member of the People's Committee in Karlovci and participated in organizing the army as deputy secretary of the Military Council, as an elected member of the Main Board at the May Assembly of 1848 he oversaw the proclamation of Serbian Vojvodina. His younger brother Stevan was severely wounded and later died of his wounds in Belgrade.Jovanovic 2008, p. 65.  Law career = Law Professor = He returned to Serbia in 1848 and is appointed Professor of Political Science and Civil Law at the Lyceum in Belgrade, he will stay until 1851. Since few textbooks existed, he wrote and printed the Civil Code, the Principles of State Law and the Public Law of Serbia. Dimitrije Matiƒá and Kosta Cukiƒá were both professors at the Lyceum whose lectures captivated the imagination and spoke to the anxieties of the first self-defined liberal generation. While continuing the tradition of cultivating, on the German model, the \\"Principles of the Rational State Law; as he entitled one of his major works (1851), Matiƒá took the contrasting of the \\"legal state\\" to the \\"police state\\" one sizable step further by upholding a Kantian notion of \\"freedom as legality\\" personal autonomy and rule of law and demanding a definite check on the state's power to interfere with individual freedom. Matiƒá was the first to talk about the \\"people's rights\\" (narodna prava), such as personal freedom, political and civil rights, which constituted a \\"natural limit to the state power\\"; and about popular representation as to the \\"organ of the people's rights.\\" A constitutional monarchy with a representative body safeguarding the \\"people's rights\\" (not sovereignty) was for Matiƒá the \\"historical\\" form of the state that stood closest to the \\"rational idea of the state\\". Dimitrije Matiƒá and Kosta Cukiƒá texts and lectures helped lay the theoretical foundations of Serbian liberalism as they criticized the existing political system in Serbia. An entire generation of the future leaders of the Serbian liberal movement were their students, most notably Jevrem Grujiƒá, Vladimir Jovanoviƒá, and Jovan Ristiƒá. Three years later, Matiƒá and Cukiƒá were dismissed from their positions because of what was seen as their negative influence on students.J.

Together with Dimitrije Crnobarac, he was sent by the Serbian government on a mission to Western countries to learn the judicial organization, and especially the procedure in civil disputes, with the aim to shorten and speed up court proceedings in Serbia.Daskalov 2013, p. 112On his return he was tasked with drafting the proposal of the first Serbian university; he also worked in the commission proposing new civil procedures. In 1848 Matiƒá became a member of the Society of Serbian Letters (Dru≈°tvo srpske slovesnosti), a precursor to the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. The Society was founded in November 1841 to promote the codification of the modern Serbian language, work on the issue of spelling and spread literacy and teaching throughout the country. King Mihailo suspended the activity of the society in 1864 as he suspected some of its members of using its offices to spread liberal ideas. Dimitrije Matiƒá was an honorary member then a permanent member of the Department of Philology and Philosophy then the Committee for the spread of science and literature. Matiƒá's History of Philosophy (1865) and \\"Encyclopaedia of Science\\" was written within the framework of the Serbian Learned Society. Ministerial offices Upon the return of Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá, Dimitrije Matiƒá is appointed Minister of Education on 3 November 1859, in the Government of Cvetko Rajoviƒá. In that post, he is succeeded by Ljubomir Nenadoviƒá. Matiƒá urged the elderly Prince to create a University. Based on the experience he had gained in foreign universities (Berlin, Heidelberg, Paris) and using the Greek example (Athens University founded in 1837), Matiƒá thinks that he has quite a willing pre-condition for starting a university in Serbia, which he proposes to Prince Milo≈°. At first, Milo≈° ordered that Matiƒá's project be implemented immediately but suddenly changes his mind, Matiƒá who could not hide his dissatisfaction with the monarch and resigned in protest from his position. After the death of Milo≈° and the return of Prince Mihailo Obrenoviƒá in September 1860, Matiƒá returned to the cassation court in late 1860, staying until 1862.–õ–µ—Ç–æ–ø–∏—Å –ú–∞—Ç–∏—Ü–µ —Å—Ä–ø—Å–∫–µ, –£ –°—Ä–ø—Å–∫–æ—ò –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ—ò –∑–∞–¥—Ä—É–∂–Ω–æ—ò —à—Ç–∞–º–ø–∞—Ä–∏—ò–∏, 1887 - Letopis Matice srpske On 10 June 1868 Prince Mihailo is killed and regency is established to rule in 14-year-old Prince Milan's name; in this three-way appointment, Milivoje Blaznavac and Jovan Ristiƒá played the main role. Dimitrije Matiƒá becomes Secretary-General of the State Council. In 1868 Matiƒá became Minister of Education again in the government of ƒêorƒëe Ceniƒá then in the government of Radivoje Milojkoviƒá. For four years, he was able to organize multiple reforms; opening a higher institution of learning such as √âcoles normales sup√©rieures for more advanced education, and the first training college for teachers in the Principality of Serbia, in Kragujevac in 1871. He is also credited for the introduction of physical education in elementary schools when in 1868 he sent a Circular to 207 elementary school teachers recommending them to dedicate 3-4 lessons weekly to gymnastics. Matiƒá increased teachers' s salaries and introduced modern methods of teaching. He was also acting minister of Foreign Affair during the period in the government of ƒêorƒëe Ceniƒá then in the government of Radivoje Milojkoviƒá, in 1872 became a member of the State Council again. Independence of Serbia Matlƒá was a member of the delegation that signed a military alliance with Montenegro, before declaring war on Turkey. After the conflict he is a member of the diplomatic corps that negotiated peace with Turkey on 1 March 1877. On March 3, 1878, The Peace Agreement of San Stefano did not meet the war plans for the expansion of Serbia and caused the dissatisfaction of the Great Powers, which demanded its revision and call for the Congress of Berlin. Serbia tried to attain support for its independence and territorial expansion within the requested borders from many countries. The attempt of the Serbian government to ensure Italian support at the Congress of Berlin was encouraged by the arrival of Italian volunteers who participated In the armed conflict during 1876. The goal or the diplomatic mission and Dimitrije Matiƒá was to ensure Italian support to Serbia, which the Italian representative In Serbia and the Italian government In resignation also supported. The Serbian Prince opted for diplomatic action in Italy and decided to send Dimitrije Matiƒá to Rome.–û –î–∏–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏—ò—É –ú–∞—Ç–∏—õ—É - —Å –ø–æ–≤–æ–¥–æ–º (‚Äû–ü–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∫–∞‚Äú, 3. —ò—É–ª 2010) Matiƒá assessed the audience with King Umberto I as a diplomatic success since he enjoyed all honors and was able to put forward Serbian demands.Rudiƒá, Biagini 2015, p. 50 In 1878 Dimitrije Matiƒá is elected president of the National Assembly of Serbia, which accepted the provisions of the Treaty of Berlin and recognized Serbia's independence; Serbia acquired almost 4,000 square miles (10,360 km) on its southeastern frontier. Serbia remained a principality until 1882 when it became a Kingdom. Minister of justice At the new Assembly, elected on October 29, 1878, the liberals got an even more convincing majority; Dimitrije Matiƒá became Minister of Justice in the second government of Jovan Ristiƒá. After the Muslims had left, the question of their property occurred, in many cases, the Turks were the landowners, and the Serbian peasants were tilling the soil and they had to give a certain part of the harvest to the Turks. After the Berlin congress, the Serbian Government decided to give that land to the peasants, for Serbia was a country of free peasant's estates, but before that, a temporary solution was found. All of the Turkish state property, as well as the private land of those Muslims, who tilled it by themselves, had been rented out. The peasants who worked on the Turkish private land had to continue to do so until the final solution was found Ibid., p. 49. According to article 39 of the Berlin treaty, Muslims, who did not wish to live in Serbia, were allowed to keep their property and to rent it to other people. This article disabled the ceding of the land to peasants without any payments to its owners, and the Serbian government did not have enough money to give compensations to the Turks. Therefore, the government and the Assembly had to agree and a special ‚Äúagricultural law‚Äù was passed by which it was decided that the peasants should pay for the land by themselves. Prices and payment conditions were to be established by a free bargain. The peasants had misused this law in different ways, so the Government was forced to float a loan abroad and to pay off the former landownersJovanoviƒá (S.), op.cit. (vol. 2), pp. 14-15.

The 20-year-old king Christian IV constructed a so-called ball house on the south side of the street in 1597. It was used for ball play and other recreational activities. The area was then part of Bremerholm. Skipperboderne, a development of navel barracks, was built close to the ball house in circa 1614. A new ball house was then built on Slotsholmen but the old one is still mentioned in the middle of the century and it is therefore unclear when it was demolished. Boldhusgade was created in 1624. The street was completely destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1795. Buildings and residents All the buildings in the street were built in the years just after the Copenhagen Fire of 1795 and have all been listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places. The north west side of the street (even numbers) consists of four properties. Studenterforeningen was for a while based at No. 2 in the first half of the 19th century. It was later home to a theatre, Boldhus Teatret. The southeast side of the street consists of just two properties.

The strategy involved the mobilization of large pilgrimages (Yatras) to gather support for pro-Hindu political positions. The concept of the Ekatmata Yatra was formulated by the Vishva Hindu Parishad in the early 1980s.  Description  During the 1960s, the rise of Hindu nationalism in Indian politics resulted in several Hindu- supportive political parties and organizations growing in size and influence. One of these political parties was Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), a right-wing organization which mobilized support for Hindu politicians and policies. In 1983, VHP decided to organize a widespread series of political pilgrimages across India; these Yatras were intended to galvanize public support for causes that VHP supported. In particular, the pilgrimages were organized in such a way as to be Pan-Hindu, allowing members of all castes to participate; this was in keeping with one of VHP's long-held opinions that the caste system should be suppressed. The march was also focused around that idea that, by reigniting interest in Hindu religious rights, Hindus would be less susceptible to conversion attempts by Christians and Muslims. The first pilgrimage (later referred to as the First Ekatmata Yatra, translatable to \\"Pilgrimage of One Soulness\\") began in November 1983, and involved thousands of Hindus undertaking a pilgrimage to various holy sites. The pilgrims formed three processions; one from Kathmandu to Rameshwaram, a second from Gangasagar to Somnath temple, and a third from Haridwar to Kanyakumari. These three main pilgrim parties were supplemented by dozens of smaller groups, and carried relics and idols with them. Many pilgrims carried water from the sacred Ganges river during the journey, and the columns of travelers often stopped at Hindu temples and holy sites to gather more sacred water. All of the pilgrimage parties eventually congregated in Nagpur. The event involved Hindus from Burma, Nepal, India, Bhutan, and Bangladesh. The first of the Ekatmata Yatras was well-received by many practitioners of Hinduism, and as such the prestige of the VHP was increased. Soon after the end of the marches, the organization was able to use the influence its high-profile pilgrimage had garnered to involve the organization in the ongoing Ayodhya dispute. VHP organized the Second Ekatmata Yatra in 1995, and the organization led two further pilgrimages (known as the 1996 Amarnath Yatra and the Baba Buddha Amarnath Yatra) in 1996 and 2005.

J. Polotsky, pages 401‚Äì465 with the possibility of ‚Äòtransposing‚Äô any given verb phrase into any of these three classes.Depuydt, Leo (1993) Conjunction, Contiguity, Contingency: On Relationships between Events in the Egyptian and Coptic Verbal Systems, page xv et seq., quoting Polotsky, Hans Jakob (1987) ‚ÄúGrundlagen des Koptischen Satzbaus: Erste H√§lfte‚Äù in American Studies in Papyrology 27Loprieno, Antonio (1995) Ancient Egyptian: A Linguistic Introduction, pages 8‚Äì10 This analysis rests on the basis of systematically applying substitutional rules for syntactic nodes, whereby certain verb phrases are seen to be syntactically converted into noun phrases or adverb phrases because of the possibility of substituting such phrases in place of the verb phrase. This approach was widely adopted in the mid-20th century but eventually fell out of favor starting in the 1980s.Allen, James (2010) Middle Egyptian: An Introduction to the Language and Culture of Hieroglyphs, second edition, pages 417‚Äì420 History The Standard Theory has its roots in the study of Coptic, where in 1944 Hans Jakob Polotsky published a study, √âtudes de syntaxe copte, showing that the Coptic ‚ÄòSecond Tense‚Äô was consistently used in emphatic sentences, while the ‚ÄòFirst Tense‚Äô was used in non-emphatic sentences. Polotsky extended this same finding to earlier Egyptian, showing that many uses of the ‚Äòimperfective‚Äô s·∏èm.f form of the Egyptian verb similarly corresponded to emphatic sentences, as did many uses of the s·∏èm.n.f form. In subsequent publications, Polotsky refined his observations into a new understanding of the Egyptian verbal system. The Standard Theory reached a broader reception in the 1960s, with some, such as Alan Gardiner, arguing against its conclusions. The theory was revised on a more linguistic basis during the 1970s, with further analyses using generative grammar. In 1976, Polotsky published Les transpositions du verbe en √©gyptien classique, his most complete treatment of the theory as it applied to classical Egyptian. Polotsky‚Äôs ideas gained widespread acceptance, and in 1983, Egyptologist Leo Depuydt first gave them the name of ‚ÄòStandard Theory‚Äô. However, while scholars of Coptic and Late Egyptian firmly adopted Polotsky‚Äôs views, they eventually came to be questioned by scholars of Old and Middle Egyptian. The consensus surrounding the Standard Theory began to crumble at the 1986 Crossroad Conference on Egyptian Grammar. Heated debate emerged by the subsequent Crossroad II and Crossroad III conferences. Papers directly challenging some of the core assumptions of the Standard Theory began to appear, as Mark Collier and others cast doubt on the adverbial nature of certain verb forms.Collier, Mark (1990) ‚ÄúThe Circumstantial s·∏èm(.f)/s·∏èm.n(.f) as Verbal Verb-Forms in Middle Egyptian‚Äù in The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, volume 76, pages 73‚Äì85 As Egyptologists became increasingly aware of new developments in general linguistics and the idiosyncrasies of the Standard Theory in the 1980s, the theory was largely superseded by interpretations of Egyptian syntax in which verbal phrases often retain their full verbal character rather than undergoing ‚Äòtranspositions‚Äô in almost all of their uses. More recent trends also pay greater attention to discourse phenomena and pragmatics in analyzing verb forms rather than following a narrowly structural approach. Though the name ‚ÄòStandard Theory‚Äô is still commonly used, the theory itself has now largely fallen out of favor as modern Egyptologists have turned to these newer approaches, variously referred to as ‚Äòverbalist‚Äô, ‚Äòpost-Polotskyan‚Äô, or the ‚ÄòNot-So-Standard Theory‚Äô.Schenkel, Wolfgang (2001) ‚ÄúGRAMMAR: Middle Egyptian‚Äù in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt, volume 2, page 54 Nonetheless, a few scholars have continued to defend the ideas of the Standard Theory against their detractors, and many of Polotsky‚Äôs discoveries remain widely accepted.Satzinger, Helmut and Shisha- Halevy, Ariel (1999) ‚ÄúThe Snark is Dead‚Äù in Lingua Aegyptia volume 6, pages 167‚Äì176 Theory While there are many variants and further developments of the Standard Theory, the core of the analysis remains Polotsky‚Äôs treatment of the Egyptian verbal system. Polotsky categorized the various forms of the classical Egyptian verb on the basis of their syntactic substitutability with other kinds of phrases. In so doing, he arrived at three basic categories under which most of the verb forms could be classified: Adjectival verb forms: * Active participle * Passive participle * Relative form Substantival verb forms: * Emphatic s·∏èm.f * Emphatic s·∏èm.n.f * Infinitive Adverbial verb forms: * Circumstantial s·∏èm.f * Circumstantial s·∏èm.n.f * Circumstantial passive s·∏èmw.f * Stative * ·∏•r + infinitive * m + infinitive * r + infinitive In Polotsky‚Äôs analysis, the common particles jw, wn.jn, Íú•·∏•Íú•.n, and m (this last with an attached suffix pronoun, e.g. m.k, m.·πØn, etc.) are seen as auxiliaries. Together with a following pronoun or noun, they form a substantival element that serves as the subject of a sentence, and they combine with following adverbial verb forms and constructions to form compound verb forms at the start of a syntactic sentence. These compound verb forms are considered ‚ÄòFirst Tense‚Äô forms by analogy with the First Tense in Coptic grammar. The initial clause with a First Tense verb form can then be followed by either a string of coordinate clauses sharing the same auxiliary or by subordinate clauses with circumstantial or prospective verb forms. Like the First Tense forms, the Second Tenses are also analyzed as consisting of a substantival element as the subject followed by an adverbial element as the predicate. However, in this case the main verb is not part of the adverbial element but the substantival element, as an emphatic (substantival) verb form with a following suffix pronoun or noun. The Second Tense serves to highlight or emphasize the adverbial element by demoting the verb from predicate to subject, nominalizing it. Another type of sentence, the so-called balanced sentence, is analyzed as two successive substantival elements containing emphatic verb forms, and can thus be seen as a special case of the Egyptian nominal sentence.

Named after the serpent deity from Egyptian mythology, the star system is surrounded by a vast complex of stellar wind and cosmic dust thrown into space by the high rotation speed of the binary's primary star and formed into a \\"pinwheel\\" shape by the secondary star's influence. Ground-based studies of the system in the 2010s concluded that the system was the best known gamma-ray burst progenitor candidate in the Milky Way galaxy.  Nomenclature  Apep, pronounced , was named by a team of astronomers led by Joseph Callingham of ASTRON, who studied the system between 2016 and 2018 and published a scientific paper on their observations. It was named after the eponymous mortal enemy of the deity of the sun Ra in Egyptian mythology, who was often illustrated as a giant serpent; their rivalry was described as \\"an apt allusion\\" to the appearance of the system and its stellar wind in infrared as \\"a star embattled within a dragon‚Äôs coils\\". In the XMM-Newton Serendipitous Source Catalogue (2XMM), a star catalog of X-ray sources observed by the XMM-Newton space telescope, the system is catalogued as 2XMM J160050.7‚Äì514245.  Characteristics  Apep is a triple star system containing a Wolf‚ÄìRayet binary described as the \\"central engine\\", orbiting with a period of ~100 years, and a third hot supergiant star described as the \\"northern companion\\", orbiting the central engine at a distance of ~1,700 astronomical units and a period of >10,000 years. The binary at the centre of Apep is composed of two classical Wolf-Rayet stars of carbon- (WC8) and nitrogen-sequence (WN4-6b) subtypes, making Apep the strongest case of a classical WR+WR binary system in the Milky Way. Carbon- sequence Wolf-Rayet stars are unique among WR stars since they are often dust- making factories. A vast complex of stellar wind and cosmic dust surrounds the system, resembling WR 104, another Wolf-Rayet star system producing a pinwheel nebula. The wind, travelling at a velocity of , and dust travelling at at the edge of the system, suggest that at least one component of the central engine is rapidly rotating, in which its surface gravity is close to being balanced by its centrifugal force outwards. This component produces faster stellar winds from its poles and slower winds from its equator, and the equatorial wind's interaction with the wind of its secondary produces the system's \\"pinwheel\\" shape. Rapidly-rotating Wolf‚ÄìRayet stars are theoretically capable of producing a gamma-ray burst during a supernova, and the system has been identified as a progenitor for a gamma-ray burst. Apep is estimated to be at a distance of ~2.4 kiloparsecs, or ~8,000 light years, from Earth, with a potential discrepancy of +0.2 and ‚àí0.5 kiloparsecs at its estimated visual extinction of 11.4.  Observation  Apep is located in the constellation of Norma, at a right ascension of and declination of , The system can be resolved into two components, the \\"central engine\\" Wolf‚ÄìRayet binary, and the \\"northern companion\\" supergiant. The total apparent magnitude of the system is 17.5, with the apparent magnitude of a resolved central engine and northern companion being 19.0 and 17.8 respectively. Its infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) is unique, with brightness ranging from an apparent magnitude of 6.4 at 2.2 ¬µm to ‚àí2.4 at 22 ¬µm. Surveys conducted with the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s SINFONI instrument on the Very Large Telescope measured the apparent magnitude in the infrared J band for the central engine as , and for the northern companion as . SINFONI also measured the apparent magnitude of the system in the K band as for the central engine and for C, in the L band as for the central engine and for the northern companion, and in the M band as for the central engine and for the northern companion. SINFONI observations further detailed that the northern companion is possibly a conventional B1Ia+ high luminosity star. A and B show a typical spectrum from a WC7 star, but with additional WN4 or WN5 star features theorised to be from one of the stars of the central engine; if confirmed, this would make Apep a rare binary system of WR stars. An alternative hypothesis also based on SINFONI data proposes that the spectra could all be from an unusual transitional WN/WC star, and that the northern companion would then be a conventional OB star. The system was the first gamma-ray burst progenitor candidate to be discovered in the Milky Way galaxy, although it had not been known as such in early observations, such as those with the XMM- Newton and Chandra space telescopes, where it had been identified simply as an X-ray source as early as August 2004. Astronomer Joe Callingham first observed Apep during undergraduate studies at the University of Sydney with the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope, and was noted as a potential colliding-wind binary, with a radio source as bright as Eta Carinae. Callingham and Peter Tuthill, who assisted in the discovery of WR 104 in 1998 and sought interest in Apep after observing its extreme infrared properties, used the ESO's Very Large Telescope for observations in August 2016. Further observations with the Anglo-Australian Telescope and the Australia Telescope Compact Array, along with contributions from various international institutions, led to the publication of a scientific paper in Nature Astronomy on 19 November 2018. It concluded that the system was a Wolf‚ÄìRayet binary and a progenitor for a gamma-ray burst. It had been previously assumed that such systems were only found in galaxies younger than the Milky Way.

Biography Hirsch was born to a Jewish family on February 6, 1858 in Halberstadt, Germany. In 1877, he joined the family business, metal trading company Aron Hirsch & Sohn , founded by the grandfather Aron Hirsch (1783-1842), in Halberstadt. In 1898, he moved to Berlin to take over the management of the Eberswalder Messingwerk after the death of his uncle Gustav Hirsch. In 1906 he joined the :de:Gesellschaft der Freunde (Society of Friends). In 1907, Aron Hirsch & Sohn discontinued its industrial activities and incorporated them into the newly founded company Hirsch Kupfer- und Messingwerke AG (HKM), Berlin, which went public in 1909 where he served as chairman of the board and shareholder. He became a member of the management board of the Berlin Stock Exchange and served on numerous supervisory boards, including Deutsche Bank. During the First World War, HKM profited due to German armaments orders but simultaneously lost money as their overseas raw material base was expropriated by Germany's war opponents. In 1929, the Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) took over the firm's industrial activities and the trading house was subsumed by Handelshaus H. Schoyer. Hirsch was involved in the Hochschule f√ºr die Wissenschaft des Judentums (the Academy for the Science of Judaism) and in the Berlin Jewish community. In 1922 he received an honorary doctorate from the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt. He was married to Amalie \\"Mally\\" Hirsch (b. Mainz d. 1865 in Frankfurt); they had two children: Siegmund Hirsch (1885-1981) and Dora \\"Dodo\\" Hirsch Schwartz (d. 1893). In 1932, Hirsch retired to Wiesbaden with his wife and initially lived in the Hotel Nassauer Hof. Due to the increasing persecution after the rise of the National Socialists and their seizure of power in 1933, the couple was forced to continuously relocate. Aron Hirsch died on February 22, 1942, in Wiesbaden; his wife Amalie committed suicide on August 27, 1942, shortly after it was announced that she would be deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp.

Unbiquadium and Ubq are the temporary IUPAC name and symbol, respectively, until the element is discovered, confirmed, and a permanent name is decided upon. In the periodic table, unbiquadium is expected to be a g-block superactinide and the sixth element in the 8th period. Unbiquadium has attracted attention, as it may lie within the island of stability, leading to longer half-lives, especially for 308Ubq which is predicted to have a magic number of neutrons (184). Despite several searches, unbiquadium has not been synthesized, nor have any naturally occurring isotopes been found to exist. It is believed that the synthesis of unbiquadium will be far more challenging than that of lighter undiscovered elements, and nuclear instability may pose further difficulties in identifying unbiquadium, unless the island of stability has a stronger stabilizing effect than predicted in this region. As a member of the superactinide series, unbiquadium is expected to bear some resemblance to its possible lighter congener uranium. The valence electrons of unbiquadium are expected to participate in chemical reactions fairly easily, though relativistic effects may significantly influence some of its properties; for example, the electron configuration has been calculated to differ considerably from the one predicted by the Aufbau principle. History=Synthesis attempts= Because complete nuclear shells (or, equivalently, a magic number of protons or neutrons) may confer additional stability on the nuclei of superheavy elements, moving closer to the center of the island of stability, it was thought that the synthesis of element 124 or nearby elements would populate longer-lived nuclei within the island. Scientists at GANIL (Grand Acc√©l√©rateur National d'Ions Lourds) attempted to measure the direct and delayed fission of compound nuclei of elements with Z = 114, 120, and 124 in order to probe shell effects in this region and to pinpoint the next spherical proton shell. In 2006, with full results published in 2008, the team provided results from a reaction involving the bombardment of a natural germanium target with uranium ions: : + ‚Üí * ‚Üí fission The team reported that they had been able to identify compound nuclei fissioning with half-lives > 10‚àí18 s. This result suggests a strong stabilizing effect at Z = 124 and points to the next proton shell at Z > 120, not at Z = 114 as previously thought. A compound nucleus is a loose combination of nucleons that have not arranged themselves into nuclear shells yet. It has no internal structure and is held together only by the collision forces between the target and projectile nuclei. It is estimated that it requires around 10‚àí14 s for the nucleons to arrange themselves into nuclear shells, at which point the compound nucleus becomes a nuclide, and this number is used by IUPAC as the minimum half-life a claimed isotope must have to potentially be recognised as being discovered. Thus, the GANIL experiments do not count as a discovery of element 124. The fission of the compound nucleus 312124 was also studied in 2006 at the tandem ALPI heavy-ion accelerator at the Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro (Legnaro National Laboratories) in Italy: : + ‚Üí * ‚Üí fission Similarly to previous experiments conducted at the JINR (Joint Institute for Nuclear Research), fission fragments clustered around doubly magic nuclei such as 132Sn (Z = 50, N = 82), revealing a tendency for superheavy nuclei to expel such doubly magic nuclei in fission.see Flerov lab annual reports 2000‚Äì2004 inclusive http://www1.jinr.ru/Reports/Reports_eng_arh.html The average number of neutrons per fission from the 312124 compound nucleus (relative to lighter systems) was also found to increase, confirming that the trend of heavier nuclei emitting more neutrons during fission continues into the superheavy mass region. =Possible natural occurrence= A study in 1976 by a group of American researchers from several universities proposed that primordial superheavy elements, mainly livermorium, unbiquadium, unbihexium, and unbiseptium, could be a cause of unexplained radiation damage (particularly radiohalos) in minerals. Unbiquadium was then suggested to exist in nature with its possible congener uranium in detectable quantities, at a relative abundance of 10‚àí11. Such unbiquadium nuclei were thought to undergo alpha decay with very long half-lives down to flerovium, which would then exist in natural lead at a similar concentration (10‚àí11) and undergo spontaneous fission. This prompted many researchers to search for them in nature from 1976 to 1983. A group led by Tom Cahill, a professor at the University of California at Davis, claimed in 1976 that they had detected alpha particles and X-rays with the right energies to cause the damage observed, supporting the presence of these elements. Others claimed that none had been detected, and questioned the proposed characteristics of primordial superheavy nuclei. In particular, they cited that the magic number N = 228 necessary for enhanced stability would create a neutron-excessive nucleus in unbiquadium that would not be beta-stable. This activity was also proposed to be caused by nuclear transmutations in natural cerium, raising further ambiguity upon this claimed observation of superheavy elements. The possible extent of primordial superheavy elements on Earth today is uncertain. Even if they are confirmed to have caused the radiation damage long ago, they might now have decayed to mere traces, or even be completely gone. It is also uncertain if such superheavy nuclei may be produced naturally at all, as spontaneous fission is expected to terminate the r-process responsible for heavy element formation between mass number 270 and 290, well before elements such as unbiquadium may be formed. =Naming= Using the 1979 IUPAC recommendations, the element should be temporarily called unbiquadium (symbol Ubq) until it is discovered, the discovery is confirmed, and a permanent name chosen. Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels, from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks, the recommendations are mostly ignored among scientists who work theoretically or experimentally on superheavy elements, who call it \\"element 124\\", with the symbol E124, (124), or 124. Some researchers have also referred to unbiquadium as eka-uranium, a name derived from the system Dmitri Mendeleev used to predict unknown elements, though such an extrapolation might not work for g-block elements with no known congeners and eka-uranium would instead refer to element 144 or 146 when the term is meant to denote the element directly below uranium. Difficulties in synthesis Every element from mendelevium onward was produced in fusion-evaporation reactions, culminating in the discovery of the heaviest known element oganesson in 2002 and most recently tennessine in 2010. These reactions approached the limit of current technology; for example, the synthesis of tennessine required 22 milligrams of 249Bk and an intense 48Ca beam for six months. The intensity of beams in superheavy element research cannot exceed 1012 projectiles per second without damaging the target and detector, and producing larger quantities of increasingly rare and unstable actinide targets is impractical. Consequently, future experiments must be done at facilities such as the under-construction superheavy element factory (SHE-factory) at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) or RIKEN, which will allow experiments to run for longer stretches of time with increased detection capabilities and enable otherwise inaccessible reactions. Even so, it is expected to be a great challenge to continue past elements 120 or 121 given short predicted half-lives and low predicted cross sections. The production of new superheavy elements will require projectiles heavier than 48Ca, which was successfully used in the discovery of elements 114-118, though this necessitates more symmetric reactions which are less favorable. Hence, it is likely that the reactions between 58Fe and a 249Cf or newly available 251Cf target are most promising. Studies on the fission of various superheavy compound nuclei have found that the dynamics of 48Ca- and 58Fe-induced reactions are similar, suggesting that 58Fe projectiles may be viable in producing superheavy nuclei up to Z = 124 or possibly 125. It is also possible that a reaction with 251Cf will produce the compound nucleus 309Ubq* with 185 neutrons, immediately above the N = 184 shell closure. For this reason, the compound nucleus is predicted to have relatively high survival probability and low neutron separation energy, leading to the 1n‚Äì3n channels and isotopes 306‚Äì308Ubq with a relatively high cross section. These dynamics are highly speculative, as the cross section may be far lower should trends in the production of elements 112‚Äì118 continue or the fission barriers be lower than expected, regardless of shell effects, leading to decreased stability against spontaneous fission (which is of growing importance). Nonetheless, the prospect of reaching the N = 184 shell on the proton-rich side of the chart of nuclides by increasing proton number has long been considered; already in 1970, Soviet nuclear physicist Georgy Flyorov suggested bombarding a plutonium target with zinc projectiles to produce isotopes of element 124 at the N = 184 shell. Predicted properties=Nuclear stability and isotopes= This nuclear chart used by the Japan Atomic Energy Agency predicts the decay modes of nuclei up to Z = 149 and N = 256\\\\. For unbiquadium (Z = 124), there are predicted regions of increased stability around N = 184 and N = 228, though many intermediate isotopes are theoretically susceptible to spontaneous fission with half-lives shorter than 1 nanosecond. Unbiquadium is of interest to researchers because of its possible location near the center of an island of stability, a theoretical region comprising longer-lived superheavy nuclei. Such an island of stability was first proposed by University of California professor Glenn Seaborg, specifically predicting a region of stability centered at element 126 (unbihexium) and encompassing nearby elements, including unbiquadium, with half-lives possibly as long as 109 years. In known elements, the stability of nuclei decreases greatly with the increase in atomic number after uranium, the heaviest primordial element, so that all observed isotopes with an atomic number above 101 decay radioactively with a half-life under a day, with an exception of dubnium-268. Nevertheless, there is a slight increase in nuclear stability in nuclides around atomic numbers 110‚Äì114, which suggests the presence of an island of stability. This is attributed to the possible closure of nuclear shells in the superheavy mass region, with stabilizing effects that may lead to half-lives on the order of years or longer for some as-yet undiscovered isotopes of these elements. While still unproven, the existence of superheavy elements as heavy as oganesson provides evidence of such stabilizing effects, as elements with an atomic number greater than approximately 104 are extremely unstable in models neglecting magic numbers. In this region of the periodic table, N = 184 and N = 228 have been proposed as closed neutron shells, and various atomic numbers have been proposed as closed proton shells, including Z = 124\\\\. The island of stability is characterized by longer half-lives of nuclei located near these magic numbers, though the extent of stabilizing effects is uncertain due to predictions of weakening of the proton shell closures and possible loss of double magicity. More recent research predicts the island of stability to instead be centered at beta-stable copernicium isotopes 291Cn and 293Cn, which would place unbiquadium well above the island and result in short half-lives regardless of shell effects. A 2016 study on the decay properties of unbiquadium isotopes 284‚Äì339Ubq predicts that 284‚Äì304Ubq lie outside the proton drip line and thus may be proton emitters, 305‚Äì323Ubq may undergo alpha decay, with some chains terminating as far as flerovium, and heavier isotopes will decay by spontaneous fission. These results, as well as those from a quantum-tunneling model, predict no half-lives over a millisecond for isotopes lighter than 319Ubq, as well as especially short half-lives for 309‚Äì314Ubq in the sub- microsecond range due to destabilizing effects immediately above the shell at N = 184\\\\. This renders the identification of many unbiquadium isotopes nearly impossible with current technology, as detectors cannot distinguish rapid successive signals from alpha decays in a time period shorter than microseconds. Increasingly short spontaneous fission half-lives of superheavy nuclei and the possible domination of fission over alpha decay will also probably determine the stability of unbiquadium isotopes. While some fission half-lives constituting a \\"sea of instability\\" may be on the order of 10‚àí18 s as a consequence of very low fission barriers, especially in even-even nuclei due to pairing effects, stabilizing effects at N = 184 and N = 228 may allow the existence of relatively long-lived isotopes. For N = 184, fission half- lives may increase, though alpha half-lives are still expected to be on the order of microseconds or less, despite the shell closure at 308Ubq. It is also possible that the island of stability may shift to the N = 198 region, where total half-lives may be on the order of seconds, in contrast to neighboring isotopes that would undergo fission in less than a microsecond. In the neutron-rich region around N = 228, alpha half-lives are also predicted to increase with increasing neutron number, meaning that the stability of such nuclei would primarily depend on the location of the beta-stability line and resistance to fission. One early calculation by P. Moller, a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, estimates the total half-life of 352Ubq (with N = 228) to be around 67 seconds, and possibly the longest in the N = 228 region. However, such conclusions are strongly dependent on the nuclear mass model used and the exact location of closed shells, as predictions for the half- lives of unbiquadium isotopes vary within over 30 orders of magnitude. =Chemical= Unbiquadium is the fourth member of the superactinide series and may be a heavier congener of uranium. In the superactinide series, the Aufbau principle is expected to break down due to relativistic effects, and an overlap of the 5g, 6f, 7d, and 8p orbitals is expected. The ground state electron configuration of unbiquadium is thus predicted to be [Og] 6f3 8s2 8p1, in contrast to [Og] 5g4 8s2 derived from Aufbau. This predicted overlap of orbitals and uncertainty in order of filling, especially for f and g orbitals, renders predictions of chemical and atomic properties of these elements very difficult. One predicted oxidation state of unbiquadium is +6, which would exist in the halides UbqX6 (X = a halogen), analogous to the known +6 oxidation state in uranium. Like the other early superactinides, the binding energies of unbiquadium's valence electrons are predicted to be small enough that all six should easily participate in chemical reactions. The predicted electron configuration of the Ubq5+ ion is [Og] 6f1. NotesReferences Hypothetical chemical elements ","title":"Unbiquadium"},{"id":"59107367","text":"Unbihexium, also known as element 126 or eka-plutonium, is the hypothetical chemical element with atomic number 126 and placeholder symbol Ubh. Unbihexium and Ubh are the temporary IUPAC name and symbol, respectively, until the element is discovered, confirmed, and a permanent name is decided upon. In the periodic table, unbihexium is expected to be a g-block superactinide and the eighth element in the 8th period. Unbihexium has attracted attention among nuclear physicists, especially in early predictions targeting properties of superheavy elements, for 126 may be a magic number of protons near the center of an island of stability, leading to longer half-lives, especially for 310Ubh or 354Ubh which may also have magic numbers of neutrons. Early interest in possible increased stability led to the first attempted synthesis of unbihexium in 1971 and searches for it in nature in subsequent years. Despite several reported observations, more recent studies suggest that these experiments were insufficiently sensitive; hence, no unbihexium has been found naturally or artificially. Predictions of the stability of unbihexium vary greatly among different models; some suggest the island of stability may instead lie at a lower atomic number, closer to copernicium and flerovium. Unbihexium is predicted to be a chemically active superactinide, exhibiting a variety of oxidation states from +1 to +8, and possibly being a heavier congener of plutonium. It is predicted to be the second element with an electron in a g orbital, a consequence of relativistic effects seen only in heavy and superheavy elements. An overlap in energy levels of the 5g, 6f, 7d, and 8p orbitals is also expected, which complicates predictions of chemical properties for this element. History=Synthesis attempts= The first and only attempt to synthesize unbihexium, which was unsuccessful, was performed in 1971 at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) by Ren√© Bimbot and John M. Alexander using the hot fusion reaction: : + ‚Üí * ‚Üí no atoms High-energy (13-15 MeV) alpha particles were observed and taken as possible evidence for the synthesis of unbihexium. Subsequent unsuccessful experiments with higher sensitivity suggest that the 10 mb sensitivity of this experiment was too low; hence, the formation of unbihexium nuclei in this reaction was deemed highly unlikely. =Possible natural occurrence= A study in 1976 by a group of American researchers from several universities proposed that primordial superheavy elements, mainly livermorium, unbiquadium, unbihexium, and unbiseptium, with half-lives exceeding 500 million years could be a cause of unexplained radiation damage (particularly radiohalos) in minerals. This prompted many researchers to search for them in nature from 1976 to 1983. A group led by Tom Cahill, a professor at the University of California at Davis, claimed in 1976 that they had detected alpha particles and X-rays with the right energies to cause the damage observed, supporting the presence of these elements, especially unbihexium. Others claimed that none had been detected, and questioned the proposed characteristics of primordial superheavy nuclei. In particular, they cited that the magic number N = 228 necessary for enhanced stability would create a neutron-excessive nucleus in unbihexium that might not be beta-stable, although several calculations suggest that 354Ubh may indeed be stable against beta decay. This activity was also proposed to be caused by nuclear transmutations in natural cerium, raising further ambiguity upon this claimed observation of superheavy elements. Unbihexium has received particular attention in these investigations, for its speculated location in the island of stability may increase its abundance relative to other superheavy elements. Any naturally occurring unbihexium is predicted to be chemically similar to plutonium and may exist with primordial 244Pu in the rare earth mineral bastnasite. In particular, plutonium and unbihexium are predicted to have similar valence configurations, leading to the existence of unbihexium in the +4 oxidation state. Therefore, should unbihexium occur naturally, it may be possible to extract it using similar techniques for the accumulation of cerium and plutonium. Likewise, unbihexium could also exist in monazite with other lanthanides and actinides that would be chemically similar. Recent doubt on the existence of primordial 244Pu casts uncertainty on these predictions, however, as the nonexistence (or minimal existence) of plutonium in bastnasite will inhibit possible identification of unbihexium as its heavier congener. The possible extent of primordial superheavy elements on Earth today is uncertain. Even if they are confirmed to have caused the radiation damage long ago, they might now have decayed to mere traces, or even be completely gone. It is also uncertain if such superheavy nuclei may be produced naturally at all, as spontaneous fission is expected to terminate the r-process responsible for heavy element formation between mass number 270 and 290, well before elements such as unbihexium may be formed. A recent hypothesis tries to explain the spectrum of Przybylski's Star by naturally occurring flerovium, unbinilium, and unbihexium. =Naming= Using the 1979 IUPAC recommendations, the element should be temporarily called unbihexium (symbol Ubh) until it is discovered, the discovery is confirmed, and a permanent name chosen. Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels, from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks, the recommendations are mostly ignored among scientists who work theoretically or experimentally on superheavy elements, who call it \\"element 126\\", with the symbol E126, (126), or 126. Some researchers have also referred to unbihexium as eka- plutonium, a name derived from the system Dmitri Mendeleev used to predict unknown elements, though such an extrapolation might not work for g-block elements with no known congeners, and eka-plutonium would instead refer to element 146 or 148 when the term is meant to denote the element directly below plutonium. Difficulties in synthesis Every element from mendelevium onward was produced in fusion-evaporation reactions, culminating in the discovery of the heaviest known element oganesson in 2002 and most recently tennessine in 2010. These reactions approached the limit of current technology; for example, the synthesis of tennessine required 22 milligrams of 249Bk and an intense 48Ca beam for six months. The intensity of beams in superheavy element research cannot exceed 1012 projectiles per second without damaging the target and detector, and producing larger quantities of increasingly rare and unstable actinide targets is impractical. Consequently, future experiments must be done at facilities such as the under-construction superheavy element factory (SHE-factory) at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) or RIKEN, which will allow experiments to run for longer stretches of time with increased detection capabilities and enable otherwise inaccessible reactions. Even so, it will likely be a great challenge to synthesize elements beyond unbinilium (120) or unbiunium (121), given their short predicted half-lives and low predicted cross sections. It has been suggested that fusion- evaporation will not be feasible to reach unbihexium. As 48Ca cannot be used beyond elements 118 or possibly 119, the only alternatives are increasing the atomic number of the projectile or studying symmetric or near-symmetric reactions. One calculation suggests that the cross section for producing unbihexium from 249Cf and 64Ni may be as low as nine orders of magnitude lower than the detection limit; such results are also suggested by the non- observation of unbinilium and unbibium in reactions with heavier projectiles and experimental cross section limits. If Z = 126 represents a closed proton shell, compound nuclei may have greater survival probability and the use of 64Ni may be more feasible for producing nuclei with 122 < Z < 126, especially for compound nuclei near the closed shell at N = 184. However, the cross section still might not exceed 1 fb, posing an obstacle that may only be overcome with more sensitive equipment. Predicted properties=Nuclear stability and isotopes= This nuclear chart used by the Japan Atomic Energy Agency predicts the decay modes of nuclei up to Z = 149 and N = 256\\\\. At Z = 126 (top right), the beta-stability line passes through a region of instability towards spontaneous fission (half-lives less than 1 nanosecond) and extends into a \\"cape\\" of stability near the N = 228 shell closure, where an island of stability centered at the possibly doubly magic isotope 354Ubh may exist. This diagram depicts shell gaps in the nuclear shell model. Shell gaps are created when more energy is required to reach the shell at the next higher energy level, thus resulting in a particularly stable configuration. For protons, the shell gap at Z = 82 corresponds to the peak of stability at lead, and while there is disagreement of the magicity of Z = 114 and Z = 120, a shell gap appears at Z = 126, thus suggesting that there may be a proton shell closure at unbihexium. Extensions of the nuclear shell model predicted that the next magic numbers after Z = 82 and N = 126 (corresponding to 208Pb, the heaviest stable nucleus) were Z = 126 and N = 184, making 310Ubh the next candidate for a doubly magic nucleus. These speculations led to interest in the stability of unbihexium as early as 1957; Gertrude Scharff Goldhaber was one of the first physicists to predict a region of increased stability in the vicinity of, and possibly centered at, unbihexium. This notion of an \\"island of stability\\" comprising longer-lived superheavy nuclei was popularized by University of California professor Glenn Seaborg in the 1960s. In this region of the periodic table, N = 184 and N = 228 have been suggested as closed neutron shells, and various atomic numbers, including Z = 126, have been proposed as closed proton shells. The extent of stabilizing effects in the region of unbihexium is uncertain, however, due to predictions of shifting or weakening of the proton shell closure and possible loss of double magicity. More recent research predicts the island of stability to instead be centered at beta-stable isotopes of copernicium (291Cn and 293Cn) or flerovium (Z = 114), which would place unbihexium well above the island and result in short half-lives regardless of shell effects. Earlier models suggested the existence of long-lived nuclear isomers resistant to spontaneous fission in the region near 310Ubh, with half-lives on the order of millions or billions of years. However, more rigorous calculations as early as the 1970s yielded contradictory results; it is now believed that the island of stability is not centered at 310Ubh, and thus will not enhance the stability of this nuclide. Instead, 310Ubh is thought to be very neutron-deficient and susceptible to alpha decay and spontaneous fission in less than a microsecond, and it may even lie at or beyond the proton drip line. A 2016 calculation on the decay properties of 288-339Ubh upholds these predictions; the isotopes lighter than 313Ubh (including 310Ubh) may indeed lie beyond the drip line and decay by proton emission, 313-327Ubh will alpha decay, possibly reaching flerovium and livermorium isotopes, and heavier isotopes will decay by spontaneous fission. This study and a quantum tunneling model predict alpha-decay half-lives under a microsecond for isotopes lighter than 318Ubh, rendering them impossible to identify experimentally. Hence, the isotopes 318-327Ubh may be synthesized and detected, and may even constitute a region of increased stability against fission around N ~ 198 with half-lives up to several seconds. Beyond this point, a \\"sea of instability\\" defined by very low fission barriers (caused by greatly increasing Coulomb repulsion in superheavy elements) and consequently fission half-lives on the order of 10‚àí18 seconds are predicted among various models. Although the exact limit of stability for half-lives over one microsecond varies, stability against fission is strongly dependent on the N = 184 and N = 228 shell closures and rapidly drops off immediately beyond the influence of the shell closure. Such an effect may be reduced, however, if nuclear deformation in intermediate isotopes may lead to a shift in magic numbers; a similar phenomenon was observed in the deformed doubly magic nucleus 270Hs. This shift could then lead to longer half-lives, perhaps on the order of days, for isotopes such as 342Ubh that would also lie on the beta- stability line. A second island of stability for spherical nuclei may exist in unbihexium isotopes with many more neutrons, centered at 354Ubh and conferring additional stability in N = 228 isotones near the beta-stability line. Originally, a short half-life of 39 milliseconds was predicted for 354Ubh toward spontaneous fission, though a partial alpha half-life for this isotope was predicted to be 18 years. More recent analysis suggests that this isotope may have a half-life on the order of 100 years should the closed shells have strong stabilizing effects, placing it at the peak of an island of stability. It may also be possible that 354Ubh is not doubly magic, as the Z = 126 shell is predicted to be relatively weak, or in some calculations, completely nonexistent. This suggests that any relative stability in unbihexium isotopes would be only due to neutron shell closures that may or may not have a stabilizing effect at Z = 126. =Chemical= Unbihexium is expected to be the sixth member of a superactinide series and possibly a heavier congener of plutonium. In the superactinide series, the Aufbau principle is expected to break down due to relativistic effects, and an overlap of the energy levels of the 7d, 8p, and especially 5g and 6f orbitals is expected, which renders predictions of chemical and atomic properties of these elements very difficult. The ground state electron configuration of unbihexium is thus predicted to be [Og] 5g2 6f3 8s2 8p1, in contrast to [Og] 5g6 8s2 derived from Aufbau. As with the other early superactinides, it is predicted that unbihexium will be able to lose all eight valence electrons in chemical reactions, rendering a variety of oxidation states up to +8 possible. The +4 oxidation state is predicted to be most common, in addition to +2 and +6. Unbihexium should be able to form the tetroxide UbhO4 and hexahalides UbhF6 and UbhCl6, the latter with a fairly strong bond dissociation energy of 2.68 eV. It may also be possible for unbihexium to form a stable monofluoride UbhF. Calculations suggest that a diatomic UbhF molecule will feature a bond between the 5g orbital in unbihexium and the 2p orbital in fluorine, thus characterizing unbihexium as an element whose 5g electrons should actively participate in bonding. It is also predicted that the Ubh6+ (in particular, in UbhF6) and Ubh7+ ions will have the electron configurations [Og] 5g2 and [Og] 5g1, respectively, in contrast to the [Og] 6f1 configuration seen in Ubt4+ and Ubq5+ that bears more resemblance to their actinide homologs. The activity of 5g electrons may influence the chemistry of superactinides such as unbihexium in new ways that are difficult to predict, as no known elements have electrons in a g orbital in the ground state.

On November 6, 2018, Acevero finished in first place with 31% of the vote and became the first openly gay Afro-Latino, and one of the youngest people, elected to the Maryland House of Delegates. A self-described Democratic Socialist, his candidacy was endorsed by labor unions, immigrant rights advocacy groups and Senator Bernie Sanders' Our Revolution. Acevero is a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity. Early life, education and career Acevero was born on October 23, 1990, in San Fernando, Trinidad; the youngest of six children to Ingrid (n√©e Renne), a government employee and labor activist and Michael Acevero, an insurance agent. His paternal family are Afro-Venezuelan and his mother is Afro-Trinidadian. Acevero was raised in the town of Couva and attended Richmond Street Boys Anglican School in the capital, Port-of-Spain. He graduated from Couva Government Secondary School in 2007, where he excelled on the school's debate team and his family immigrated to the United States later that year, settling in Maryland. Acevero started college at 16, earning his associate degree in international relations from Montgomery College and a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) in 2011 at the age of 20. He was a student activist in college, volunteered for political campaigns and was active in the state Democratic Party. Acevero worked as an issue organizer after college, first on the successful Question 4 (Maryland Dream Act) and Question 6 (Marriage Equality) campaigns in 2012‚ÄîMaryland became the first state to approve both measures at the ballot box‚Äîand then in 2014 on transgender equality. He was recognized by the National Black Justice Coalition as one of its \\"100 Black LGBTQ Emerging Leaders to Watch\\" for his advocacy and efforts to reform Maryland's justice system. A Black Lives Matter activist, Acevero helped organize and was involved in protests during the 2015 Freddie Gray unrest in Baltimore City. He was arrested while protesting and later released without being charged. Acevero joined the coalition of activists and organizations that advocated for the reform of Maryland's Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBR) following Freddie Gray's death. Prior to running for office, he was involved in decarceration efforts in Maryland. Acevero joined the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Union Local 1994 in 2016 as a union representative and organizer where he represented workers on workplace and contractual issues. He joined the Maryland Fight for $15 campaign and organized low wage workers and community groups to support raising the minimum wage in Montgomery County. The County Council overwhelmingly approved the bill and it was signed into law in 2017. In December 2017, Acevero was among a group of activists, labor leaders, clergy and lawmakers who were arrested on the steps of Capitol Hill for engaging in unlawful demonstration. The group was hoping to pressure Congress to include legislation for undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children. He was also behind the push that led to the renaming of an Elementary School in honor of gay Civil Rights leader, Bayard Rustin. In his testimony before the Montgomery County Board of Education, Acevero criticized the Trump Administration's decision to remove LGBTQ people off the US Census and the transgender military ban: \\"We have a hostile administration that is intent on erasing LGBTQ folks, recently taking us off the Census and banning transgender Americans from serving their country. Now more than ever we need to affirm LGBTQ youth, and that's why Bayard Rustin is such a powerful name for this school.\\" The Montgomery County Board of Education voted to approve the renaming of the school. Acevero ran in the three-member house district which includes parts of Gaithersburg, Germantown, Clarksburg, Montgomery Village and the Town of Washington Grove. He won the Democratic primary on June 26, 2018, besting three-term incumbent Delegate Kirill Reznik and two- term incumbent, Delegate Shane Robinson in the hotly contested primary. He faced nominal Republican opposition in the general and was elected on November 6, 2018, at the age of 28. Acevero was sworn in on a copy of James Baldwin's 1963 book, The Fire Next Time and assumed office on January 9, 2019. Maryland Legislature Acevero sits on the House Appropriations Committee and is a member of the Maryland Legislative Black Caucus, the Latino Legislative Caucus and the Montgomery County Delegation. During his first session as a delegate, Acevero successfully introduced a bill requiring diaper-changing stations in men's restrooms and worked on school funding issues. He also introduced several other bills, including \\"Anton's Law,\\" a bill requiring transparency in investigations of complaints against police officers. The bill was named for Anton Black, a 19-year-old African-American man who was killed by police in Greensboro, Maryland. Another significant legislative priority for Acevero has been Universal Basic Income (UBI). His proposal would direct 25% of the income generated from medical and recreational cannabis taxation is redirected into an investment account and the returns are then proportionally given to the citizens of Maryland. House Bill 1089 was referred to the House Appropriations Committee but did not move out of committee. Acevero called the idea as a ‚Äúform of social security, and it is one of the most transformative policies that we can enact at the state and federal level to put a dent in extreme poverty,‚Äù and pointed to Alaska's use of it to combat income inequality. Within the 2020 legislative session, Acevero also supported the expansion of funding support to public schools in Maryland as proposed by the Kirwan Commission. Acevero noted that ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre trying to do here is change the trajectory of this state ... All of us will win when we invest in education.‚Äù Although he serves on the Appropriations, not Judiciary, Committee, police reform is among his top legislative priorities. Acevero has sponsored legislation to restrict police officers' use of force, and to repeal Maryland's Law Enforcement Officer's Bill of Rights, all or in part. He claims that he was fired from his job as a union organizer due to his sponsorship of police reform legislation. Awards and honors The National Black Justice Coalition named Acevero one of its \\"100 Black LGBTQ Emerging Leaders to Watch\\" in 2015. The Advocate magazine named Acevero one of its \\"50 Champions of Pride\\" in its June 2018 issue. The G-Listed named Acevero one of its \\"Black LGBTQ Power 100 in 2018,\\" and LGBTQ Nation named him one of its 10 favorite LGBTQ candidates of 2018. Personal life Acevero is one of six openly LGBT members of the Maryland General Assembly. He's a pescatarian and doesn't drink alcohol.

They were heavily influenced by Emiliano Zapata and his ideology of zapatism. The political and economic structure of the territory was militarily supported by the Liberation Army of the South, which was where the army was formed. The commune is also at times compared to Nestor Makhno's anarchist free territory in eastern Ukraine, due to their shared structures and ideals. History=Manuel Palafox's agrarian reform= The temporary peace during 1914 provided time for the farmers of southern Mexico to lay the foundations for the socio-economic reconstruction of the country. The most important political tool in the revolutionary struggle was the Liberation Army of the South, which not only fought but expropriated and distributed the lands as soon as it could. In 1914, Manuel Palafox was appointed Minister of Agriculture by the Aguascalientes Convention, becoming the Zapatista with the highest office in the nascent democratic government of the Convention, which brought together almost all the then existing Mexican revolutionary forces on 1 October 1914. From January 1915 Palafox began to draw up plans to implement agrarian reform: firstly he founded the National Bank of Rural Credit and then a whole series of structures (Regional Agriculture Schools and the National Factory of Agricultural Tools) necessary for agrarian development in the egalitarian sense. =The Morelos Commune= Palafox radicalized the Plan of Ayala, expropriating lands from landowners without compensation, issuing a very revolutionary agrarian law which could only be applied in the Zapatista state of Morelos. The main problem was that the Convention was not able to influence national politics, due to internal divisions and external threats. Starting from 1915, in any case, egalitarian policies were implemented, aimed at creating self-managed peasant communities in which the government, governors and governed proceeded together and without seeking power for their own sake. As a result, every form of hierarchical power was substantially overthrown. The police, state officials and the army were stripped of the power exercised in the past, the same Southern Liberation Army when not engaged in battle was, in fact, a structure without power. The Zapatistas also gave great importance to education, young students and intellectuals came to Morelos to create public schools and adult education. At the end of 1917 the Zapatista communities were basically able to manage themselves, thanks to the effective popular assemblies that held the administrative power of the municipalities. Government existed, but it went from bottom to top and not vice versa. Zapata himself set the example by refusing any power, whether local or national: = Downfall = The Morelos Commune would begin its decline when Venustiano Carranza assumed power in 1917, being recognized as President of Mexico by the imperialist powers of Germany and the United States. Carranza, at this point now fighting his once fellow revolutionaries, ordered general Pablo Gonzalez to pacify Morelos. Using overwhelming firepower, he successfully pushed Zapata's guerrilla forces out of the cities of Morelos. A year later, Zapata was able to push Gonzalez's army out of Morelos. The commune now was only a shell of its former self. As his forces were always under military pressure in Morelos by his opponents, Zapata's civil administration was unable to carry out any major reforms in the region. Unable to hold together their alliance with the Villistas, and increasingly reliant on the liberal Felicistas, Palafox was removed from his post and the Aguascalientes Convention was dissolved. Being pressured by Gonzalez's forces, Zapata attempted to convince a desertion with one of Gonzalez's cavalry officers. At the meeting where Zapata discussed this, he was assassinated. The Morelos Commune ceased to exist at this point, as the now demoralized guerrillas were pushed back into the mountains. The population of Morelos, especially the peasants would suffer repercussions by the occupying forces, including the burning of villages, and slave labor.  Ideology  The Morelos Commune shared many similarities in political structure with its contemporary Anarchist Free Territory in Ukraine, it also inspired the creation of the Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities in 1994, militarily protected by the EZLN, in the state of Chiapas, Mexico.

See: Abraham Hermanjat 2012, p=103-109. He was also involved in cultural politics.  Biography  After attending the public schools of Geneva, he studied art with Barth√©lemy Menn and Auguste Baud-Bovy. In 1886, he went to Algiers, to join his mother and brother after his father's death. He stayed until 1888 and returned on two other occasions; 1889-1890 and 1893-1896.S√©jours maghr√©bins d‚ÄôHermanjat : octobre 1886-1888, octobre 1889-1890, 1893-1896. During these visits, he developed an interest in Orientalism, a genre which was already in favor with some of his compatriots, including Charles Gleyre and Auguste Veillon.On Swiss Orientalism, see: Von ferne l√§sst gr√ºssen. Schweizer Orientmalerei des 19. Jahrhunderts, cat. exp., Soleure, Kunstmuseum Solothurn. Heidelberg, Kehrer Verlag, 2001 His paintings there were executed in the traditional styles he had learned in Geneva. In 1896 Hermanjat, then married, returned with his wife to Switzerland and initially settled in Lausanne. In 1908, they moved to Aubonne. By 1911, he had built a cottage there, where he lived until his death. He soon abandoned Orientalism and turned to landscapes, spending much of his time in the mountains; primarily near Aigle, although he also visited Valais, Nendaz, Haute-Nendaz and Verbier. His paintings from this period owe much to the influence of Giovanni Segantini. During the years 1908 to 1912, he became attracted to Fauvism and began applying non-natural colors to his landscapes.On Hermanjat and Fauvism, see: . In 1910, following genealogical research, he began spelling his name \\"Hermanjat\\", rather than \\"Hermenjat\\" as he had previously. It was also at this time that he made the acquaintance of Ferdinand Hodler and was influenced by Symbolism.On the links between Hodler and Hermanjat, see : Laurent Langer : ¬´ Dans le sillage de Hodler : Abraham Hermanjat ¬ª, Les lettres & les arts. Cahiers de critique litt√©raire et artistique, hors s√©rie consacr√© √† Ferdinand Hodler, 2013, . Over the next decade, however, C√©zanne would supplant Hodler as his primary inspiration. From 1910 to 1928, he was a member of the Central Committee of the Society of Swiss Painters, Sculptors and Architects (SPSAS).See various articles in the SPSAS review, L‚Äôart suisse. Organe pour la protection et le d√©veloppement des int√©r√™ts des artistes suisses.

This was in addition to several teaching positions and jury service for art competitions. His adopted daughter, Germaine Hermanjat (1909-2002), started out to be a painter but devoted herself to the promotion of his works. In 2003, following her death, money she had bequeathed to the city of Nyon was used to create the Abraham Hermanjat Foundation. In 2012, the , the Mus√©e du L√©man and the foundation joined, on the occasion of his 150th anniversary, to present the first major showing of his works in over thirty years.

Poets created a series of loose prints that circulated in urban areas. It was advertised and spread by hanging it from string hung in common areas between poles or from trees. Many of the people who wrote the poems were either peasants, or poets who used the voices and opinions of the people to comment on news or social events.  Themes  Many of the poems in Lira popular are centered on themes such as misery, love, violence, murder, life, death, crime and religion. Poets chose these subjects to excite curiosity in readers where the accompanying illustrations depict the conditions and circumstances of their lives.  Printing  Lira popular were printed in varying forms over time. The first popular pages measured 26 x 35 cm in Chile. Over time, they grew to 54 x 38. Liras today are of similar size. Each sheet of a Lira consists of 5 to 8 poems with pictures and drawings usually created by the poets. The purpose of these drawings is to illustrate the work's theme. The accompanying pictures illustrate the poem's story. The two types of images seen in Lira popular are xylography, where rough artwork was sent to poets to be described in verse. The signature of the engraver was often omitted. However, Adolfo Reyes was responsible for many of the illustrations. He illustrated his own verses using a penknife and raul√≠ board. The second type of image is known as clich√©. These are old images that weren‚Äôt always necessarily relevant to the content, but were used simply as decoration. Titles of Lira popular are similar to titles in newspapers today; in a large font, to catch attention. Greetings to the Child of God, an image sketched by Rosa Araneda c.1858  History  In many Latin American countries, news traveled slowly, especially between Spain and Central and South America. Lira, aided by the printing press, allowed for news to spread faster than just by word of mouth. In the beginning, Lira popular was used to allude to events that were happening in Spain and other countries, but over time it became more of a cultural trend, eventually used as a representation of a country‚Äôs experiences and events. In order to have their poetry published in Lira popular, poets were responsible for registering their names. They were in charge of making sure that their works were published and had to go out in public and work hard to sell those original works. In addition to signing his name (or a pseudonym), the poet often distributed copies in the streets where workers, peasants and artisans could have access. As it was a largely illiterate group at the time, the images and public readings helped to attract people to hear the reading of the tenths out loud. = Timeline = 1541 Written poetic forms and other works are introduced in Chile, such as romances and counterpoint articles, through missionaries and writers, as well as imported books and documents. 1866 The War against Spain caused the appearance of the first poetic documents that talked about news. 1879 The War of the Pacific is talked about by popular poets through the Popular Lira 1880 Bernardino Guajardo, considered the most important popular Chilean poet of the nineteenth century, published poems in five volumes in the same form as Lira popular. 1891 Development and boom of the Lira popular. 1920 The rate of the printing of popular liras falls as a result of the expansion of the publishing and journalism industry. The first study on the Lira Popular, by the German ethnologist and linguist Rodolfo Lenz, is published in Chile. 1952 Diego Mu√±oz and In√©s Valenzuela begins publishing ‚ÄúLira Popular‚Äù in newspapers with the contributions of many poets or ‚Äúpayadores‚Äù  Collections  Currently there are three full collections of Lira being displayed and held for public use. Of the three, two are displayed at The Archive of Oral Literature and Popular Traditions at the National Library of Chile, and the third is in the Andr√©s Bello Central Archive of the University of Chile.

He was apparently self-taught. Biography He was born in what was then the Duchy of Schleswig. He spent time in the Netherlands and Hamburg before settling in Stockholm. It is not known with whom (or if) he took art lessons. However, after studying animal anatomy with an uncle named Norling, who was a veterinary surgeon, he enlisted in the (cavalry regiment) in 1829. He began by painting small pictures of horses in pastel, but soon switched to oils and the occasional lithograph. His works were executed while on assignment as well as at his home base. He was eventually promoted to Lieutenant and, in 1837, was officially granted the title of Ryttm√§stare (riding master). After leaving the service, he spent some time in Berlin then, in 1840, went to Paris, where he decided to stay, although he remained a Swedish citizen. He soon became famous for his animal paintings and was commissioned to do equestrian portraits of King Karl XIV Johan, then-Prince Karl XV and Napoleon III. He also exhibited at the Salon in 1844 and 1846. His most often reproduced painting is √ñversv√§mningen (The Flood), which depicts a dog, clinging to wreckage, while her puppies swim there to safety. Later, he was named a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts and court painter. During the Paris Commune, his home in Saint-Cloud was destroyed.

It is a satire of consumerism and modernity, and follows the events of a national experiment where a \\"model couple\\" representing the typical French pair is subjected to constant surveillance as they undergo experiences both mundane and absurd.  Themes  Originally intended as a piece of a larger production, The Model Couple is a satire that is critical of mass media, technology and government surveillance, and investigates the ways in which liberal societies can become oppressively totalitarian. Despite these heavy themes, the film's tone is largely slapstick, interspersed with psychedelic sequences.  Plot  In 1970s France, Jean-Michel (Andr√© Dussollier) and Claudine (An√©mone) are chosen by the Ministry of the Future to be the \\"model couple\\", a heterosexual pair to be used as test subjects in order to create \\"a new city for the new man\\" in the year 2000. Immediately upon their arrival at the test facility, Jean-Michel and Claudine are subjected to constant surveillance and monitoring by a pair of unfriendly sociologists (Zouc and Jacques Boudet) who constantly rate and evaluate the couple. The couple are asked to evaluate various state-of-the-art consumer products and to go through their daily routines in increasingly alienating and Kafkaesque circumstances. As the experiment proceeds, the media speculates endlessly about its progress on talk shows and in news reporting, and the couple becomes increasingly irritated with the sociologists, the experiment, and each other. The sociologists true motives become unclear, as they simultaneously mislead the couple as to the purpose of the experiment while themselves expressing contempt for the experiment's supposed intent and proceedings. The experiment enters a new phase, titled \\"denormalization\\". The couple are visited by guests, including a government minister and the American psychologist Dr. Goldberg, who humiliates Jean-Michel by testing his submissiveness to authority. Later, a group of teenage terrorists (who are likely also employed by the Ministry of the Future, although this is left ambiguous) invades the experiment chamber wielding fake weapons. The terrorists propose that the couple play along with them and rebel against the experiment, unplugging all of the surveillance equipment and covering the walls with graffiti. A hostage team is sent to negotiate with the terrorists while the news media speculates wildly as to their motives and the consequences for the experiment. The terrorists demand airtime on television in exchange for the release of the couple, and film a short video together with Jean-Michel and Claudine. At the end of the film, Jean-Michel and Claudine are evicted from the experiment without an explanation as the terrorists and sociologists walk away.  Production  The film was written and directed by William Klein, edited by Valerie Mayoux, and has music by Michel Colombier and Hugues Aufray. William Klein and Philippe Rousselot are credited for cinematography.  Cast  * Andr√© Dussollier: Jean-Michel * An√©mone: Claudine * Zouc: Psycho-sociologist no. 1 * Jacques Boudet: Psycho- sociologist no. 2 * Eddie Constantine: Doctor Goldberg * Georges Descri√®res: Minister of the Future * Andr√© Penvern: TV commentator  Reception and legacy  In a review for the Criterion Collection, Michael Koresky describes the film as \\"soberingly prescient\\" and \\"remarkably fresh...a social satire [that] carries a timeless sting\\". A review in T√©l√©rama wrote that the film's improvised tone was both charming and a limitation which underscored director William Klein's penchant for documentaries over fiction, concluding that The Model Couple is overall quite funny and that Zouc's performance as an antisocial psychosociologist alone makes the film worth watching. The film is included in a Criterion Collection box set of William Klein's films.

It contains 338 Standard Chinese words that have variant written forms (i.e. where the same word may be written with one or more different Chinese characters with the same pronunciation, referred to as \\"\\", translated into English in the official publication as \\"variant forms of the same word\\"). In the First Series, one of the variant written forms for each word was selected as the recommended standard form. Content Most of the decisions reached about the recommended standard forms for each word were reached based in part on statistical analysis of the usage of the variant written forms in the People's Daily during the period 19952000. Dictionaries consulted in the decision-making process included Xiandai Hanyu Cidian, Hanyu Da Cidian, Cihai, Xinhua Cidian and Xiandai Hanyu Guifan Zidian. Based on the evaluation of the committee, a decision was made concerning which form would be recommended to be considered as the standard form and which form(s) would be labelled as a variant form. A book was published detailing the rationales behind the decisions of the committee. For example, the Chinese word written and pronounced as ' in Mandarin Pinyin (meaning: to receive an order) can be written as either (1) or (2) / (where both alternatives are as written as b«êngch√©ng and have the same meaning). In The First Series of Standardized Forms of Words with Non-standardized Variant Forms, the first form () was recommended to be the standard form, and the second form () was designated as a variant form. The committee chose the first form () as the recommended standard form because Xiandai Hanyu Cidian and Xinhua Cidian recommended the first form () and because this form had been used 104 times in the People's Daily between 1995 and 2000. This decision was reached despite the fact that the second form () was recommended by Cihai and the committee explicitly stated that the second form was probably the more linguistically appropriate alternative based on analysis of the usage and definition of the relevant characters as found in Shuowen, Guangya, and Zuozhuan. The second form () was determined to have fallen out of popular usage in a modern context- it had been used only three times in the People's Daily between 1995 and 2000. Implementation The Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China has called on teachers throughout China to use and teach the forms recommended in The First Series of Standardized Forms of Words with Non-standardized Variant Forms. Before March 31, 2005, a student's use of one of the variant written forms not recommended in the First Series on a test like Gaokao would not influence points earned on a given question. Implementation of the Ministry's policy is not to influence the usage of variant written forms in research on ancient Chinese works or works written in traditional characters.
