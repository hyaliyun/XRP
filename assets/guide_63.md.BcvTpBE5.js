Its main line runs from Rockland, Michigan, to Green Bay, Wisconsin, and it also owns various branch lines and out-of-service track. History Founding‚Äì1978 The railroad was founded as the Escanaba and Lake Superior Railway on November 17, 1898, by Isaac Stephenson, a local businessman, with of track from Wells, Michigan, northwest.. Over the next several years it built track to Channing, Michigan, where it connected with the Milwaukee Road.. In 1900, the Milwaukee Road built a dock for iron ore transport near Escanaba, Michigan, and began using the ELS to access its new facility. As part of the agreement that allowed the Milwaukee Road access to its line, the ELS was reincorporated as the Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad on February 12, 1900; it has used this name ever since. In 1902, the ELS built of track southeast out of Wells into the center of Escanaba. In 1935, the Milwaukee Road moved its ore trains off the ELS and entered into an agreement with the Chicago & North Western Railroad (CNW) to jointly operate ore trains into Escanaba. Though the ELS petitioned the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) and later the US Supreme Court to be allowed to join the joint operations, it was blocked from doing so in 1938 by the Supreme Court. In the 1940s, two major sources of traffic were developed near Escanaba‚Äîthe Harnischfeger Corporation, which built large cranes, and the Escanaba Paper Company.. In the early 1960s, the ELS was purchased by the Hanna Mining Company. In 1969, the ELS stopped serving the Escanaba Paper Company during a strike at the mill; in response, the mill's owners built a new connection to the CNW and Soo Line, and cut car movements on the ELS more than five-fold in two years, from 2,200 carloads in 1968 to 449 in 1970. The ELS continued skeleton service during the 1970s. In 1978, Hanna requested permission from the ICC to abandon the railroad. 1978‚Äìpresent On October 6, 1978, Hanna sold the railroad to John Larkin, a businessman from Minneapolis who had organized a passenger excursion on the railroad earlier in the decade.. He planned to return the railroad to profitability by reducing labor costs and entering the business of leasing boxcars to other railroads. Shortly thereafter, the leasing market collapsed. Additionally, with the Milwaukee Road going bankrupt in 1977, it planned to abandon its trackage in Michigan, consisting largely of a route between Ontonagon, Michigan, and Green Bay, Wisconsin.. This plan would break the ELS's connections at Channing, as well as end rail service to shippers on the line. One of these shippers, Champion Paper, which operated a mill in Ontonagon, approached the ELS with a proposal for the railroad to buy the Milwaukee Road track to Ontonagon. After opposition from the CNW, which wanted to retain iron ore transport from a mine on the route, and Hanna Mining (former owner of the ELS and owner of the mine in question, the Groveland Mine in Randville, Michigan), the ELS, backed by other on-line shippers and the states of Michigan and Wisconsin, reached an agreement with the Milwaukee Road's bankruptcy court to take control of the Ontonagon route, as well as additional trackage south. On March 10, 1980, the ELS bought the ex-Milwaukee Road between Ontonagon through Channing south to Iron Mountain, Michigan.. It also obtained a lease-to-own agreement of the tracks south from Iron Mountain to Green Bay; this section was purchased in 1982. Upon purchase, the ELS immediately began rebuilding its new trackage, which had been neglected by the Milwaukee Road in the years leading up to its bankruptcy. Major funding came from the state of Michigan, which paid $1.6 million (equivalent to $ in ) to install new ties on the track to Ontonagon. The freight yard in Channing, Michigan, which was the junction for Milwaukee Road trains bound for Ontonagon. 2015 In 1981, the ELS bought additional trackage, this time a branch line from Channing north to Republic, Michigan. In 1985, it bought a branch from Crivitz, Wisconsin, on the Green Bay line, east to Marinette, Wisconsin, and Menominee, Michigan. During 1987 and 1988, the line to Ontonagon had its lightweight rails replaced with new, heavier rails. In 1991, it bought a line from Sidnaw, Michigan, on the Ontonagon line, east to Nestoria. The following year, the line from Channing to Wells was taken out of service, with access to Escanaba retained via a new trackage rights agreement with the Wisconsin Central Railroad, under which the ELS was granted access the WC's line from Pembine, Wisconsin, to North Escanaba. In 1995, it bought a short branch line between Stiles Junction, Wisconsin, just north of Green Bay, to Oconto Falls from the CNW.. In 2005, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation provided a $2.01 million (equivalent to $ in ) grant to rebuild trackage from Crivitz north to the Michigan state line. This was the last section of mainline track that had not seen a complete rebuild since it was bought in 1980. The various branch lines are often used by the railroad to store rolling stock. After closure of the Smurfit-Stone Paper Mill in Ontonagon in 2009, the of track between Ontonagon and Rockland was abandoned in 2011, and the railroad no longer reaches Lake Superior. The remaining trackage between Rockland and Mass City is used for 3rd party long term car storage. The railroad's northernmost customer ships logs from an open air transload in the yard near the junction of East Branch Road and Depot Road in Mass City. Rolling stock When it began operations, the ELS used steam locomotives purchased second hand from other railroads in the Midwest. It bought a new Shay locomotive for logging service in 1904, followed by various locomotives from Baldwin.. Its first diesel locomotive, a Baldwin VO-1000, was purchased in 1946. The railroad continued buying new and used Baldwins for the next several decades. In 1985, the first EMD diesel, a GP-38 was purchased, followed shortly by additional GP-38s and SD9s.. In 2003, the railroad bought two SD-40-2s, and, unusually, an FP7 two years later. Sometime in 2020, the railroad bought a former BNSF Railway EMD SD-40-2 and numbered it 503.

It is on the north bank of the River Thames about south of Witney. Archaeology There was a modest Iron Age and Roman-era pastoral settlement east of what is now Old Shifford Farm. It was abandoned around the end of the 1st century AD, but a new settlement was established slightly north of the old one toward the end of the 3rd century AD. The Oxford Archaeological Unit excavated the sites in 1988‚Äì89, after which it was excavated as a gravel pit parallel with Brighthampton Cut. Late Iron Age and Roman artefacts found at the site include ceramic loom weights and parts of pots and plates; Roman coins from the 1st to the 4th centuries AD, but particularly the late 3rd to late 4th centuries; copper items including brooches, a pin and a bracelet, iron items, particularly nails; lead items including weights, pot rivets and lead shot; and stone items including several quern-stones and a whetstone. Bone fragments found at the site came mostly from cattle (16.4%), sheep and goats (10.7%) and horses (10.7%). Farming at the site seems to have been mostly pastoral; there was little evidence of arable cultivation. History The settlement arose by a ford across the Thames, from which it derived its toponym (\\"sheep ford\\"). It was mentioned in a charter of 1005, when the estate was granted to Eynsham Abbey. A 17th century tradition that Alfred the Great held a council at Shifford arose from a reference to Sifford in the 12th or 13th century poem The Proverbs of Alfred, now thought not to refer to this place. In the 17th century Shifford had between 15 and 23 houses. By 1881 the population had risen to 70 but by 1951, the last year for which separate figures are available, it had fallen to 27. It is now a largely deserted village. Until the 19th century Shifford was a township in the parish of Bampton. It became a separate civil parish in 1866. In 1954 the parish was united with Aston Bampton to form the parish of Aston Bampton and Shifford, later renamed Aston, Cote, Shifford and Chimney. Chapel Base and broken shaft of a 15th-century preaching cross (right) in St Mary's churchyard Shifford was never an ecclesiastical parish but in medieval times it was a dependent chapelry of Bampton. The chapel was later described as \\"Georgian\\" and became derelict by the 19th century. In 1863 it was replaced with a Gothic Revival one designed by the architect Joseph Clarke. It is a Grade II listed building. Shifford Lock A lock on the River Thames was built in 1898 half a mile upstream from Shifford. It is accessible on foot from Chimney, but not directly from Shifford.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Diego Padres, Texas Rangers and Los Angeles Dodgers. Venable is the son of former Major League outfielder Max Venable as well as the older brother of Canadian Football League safety Winston Venable. Venable played basketball for Princeton University, as well as San Rafael High School. He was the second athlete to earn first-team All-Ivy League honors in both baseball and basketball. In the 2005 MLB Draft, the Padres selected Venable in the seventh round. He made his major league debut on August 29, 2008, against the Colorado Rockies, collecting his first hit. Although he broke into the Major Leagues as a center fielder, he played mostly right field after his second season. Venable frequently batted lead off and on several occasions came within one hit of the cycle. , he finished among the top ten in the National League in triples four times and in stolen bases twice. He has the most Major League Baseball career hits and home runs of any Princeton alumnus. Amateur career High school Venable was born in 1982 in Marin County, California, at a time when his father Max Venable was a Major League Baseball player for the nearby San Francisco Giants. He grew up travelling around the country with his father and also lived in Japan and the Dominican Republic. In high school, he envisioned himself as more likely to be a professional basketball player than baseball player. Prior to his freshman year, his mother, Molly, objected to him quitting baseball to focus on basketball. As both a high school sophomore and a high school junior, Venable was second-team San Francisco Bay Area All-Metro basketball player for San Rafael High School. He was the Marin County Athletic League (MCAL) most valuable player in basketball as a freshman, sophomore and junior. As a sophomore, he led his team to the MCAL League Championship. As a senior, he gave up the responsibility of being point forward. College career Venable chose to attend Princeton University, not for its academics, but for its tradition of basketball excellence. He respected their tradition of qualifying to participate in the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Tournament. During his time at the University he was a part of two teams that qualified for post season play: 2004 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament and 2002 National Invitation Tournament). Princeton recruited him as a basketball player. He did not play baseball as a freshman, but his father had directed him to Scott Bradley, Princeton's baseball coach, during his recruiting visit. Venable, who was a member of the class of 2005 at Princeton University, was the second athlete in Ivy League history (after his Padres teammate Chris Young) to be first-team All-Ivy in both basketball and baseball and he played on Ivy League Champion National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Championship tournament participants in both sports. He played in two NCAA Championship tournaments in both sports and earned a B.A. in anthropology. In basketball, he averaged over 10 points and over 30 minutes per game in his 2002‚Äì03 sophomore season through his 2004‚Äì05 senior season. Bradley had left the door open for Venable to come take batting practice if he ever had the urge. As a sophomore, at the suggestion of his mother, Venable resumed baseball. He posted modest numbers in his first season, but in 2004, he hit for a .344 batting average, earned All-Ivy honorable mention, and was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the fifteenth round of the draft (439th overall). Bradley felt that Major League Baseball scouts undervalued Venable because he did not participate in the Cape Cod League for college baseball players. Thus, instead of signing and giving up his amateur status, Venable returned for his senior season and posted a league leading 9 home runs and runner-up .385 batting average while earning All-League honors. Subsequently, the Padres drafted him in the seventh round (215th overall); he was signed by the Padres' Northeast Scouting Director, Jim Bretz. Professional career Minor League Baseball After graduating from Princeton, Venable made his professional debut in minor league baseball with the Arizona League Padres of the Arizona League in 2005. He hit for a .322 batting average in 15 games and was soon promoted to the Eugene Emeralds of the Single-A Northwest League. In 2006, Venable was the Padres Minor League Player of the Year. With his father as a team hitting coach, Venable posted a .314 batting average, .389 on-base percentage (OBP), and .477 slugging percentage for the Fort Wayne Wizards of the single-A Midwest League (MWL), which earned him both mid-season and post- season MWL All-star honors. That season he tied for the MWL lead in runs scored and was among the top four Padre farmhands in RBIs, batting average, and stolen bases. Among his highlights for the Wizards were his team-high two grand slams and a five-hit performance. Subsequently, for the 2006 West Oahu CaneFires of the Hawaii Winter Baseball, Venable posted a .330 batting average, .390 on-base percentage (OBP), and .473 slugging percentage. He won the batting title that season and was named league most valuable player. He also led the league in doubles and was second to John Otness in OBP. In the outfield, Venable made no errors. Before the 2007 season, Venable was listed as the fifth best prospect in the Padres organization by Baseball America, and they named him the #11 prospect in the league. They also named him as a Baseball America Low-A All-Star. In 2007, Venable batted .278 with a .337 OBP in 134 games for the San Antonio Missions of the Texas League. This again earned him both mid-season and post-season league All-Star honors. A highlight occurred on May 30, 2007, when he hit for the cycle. After the season ended, he was invited to play for the San Diego affiliate in the Arizona Fall League, but he was afflicted with tendinitis in his shoulder and only hit .228. During 2008 spring training, he had two home runs and eight runs batted in his first twelve at-bats. He then posted a .292 batting average, .361 on-base percentage and .464 slugging percentage in 120 games for the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League in 2008. San Diego Padres =2008‚Äì2011= Venable had been expected to be a September 2008 call-up, but when Scott Hairston was forced onto the disabled list, Venable was called up ahead of schedule. On August 29, 2008, in his debut, he tripled in his first at-bat and came around to score a run. He is the twenty-fifth Princeton alumnus to play in the Major Leagues, but he is the first African-American alumnus. He posted his first Major League home run in his sixth game on September 4, 2008, during a 5‚Äì2 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers at Miller Park. His only other home run for the 2008 San Diego Padres was also in a victory on the road on September 19, 2008 in an 11‚Äì6 victory over the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park. During this game, Venable posted his first three-hit performance and first three-RBI performance. When Venable batted leadoff for the Padres on September 28, 2008 against Pittsburgh, he became the first Princeton batter to oppose a Princeton pitcher (Ross Ohlendorf). In 2008, Venable accumulated only 110 Major League at-bats, and rookie year is considered to be the season in which one accumulates his 130th at-bat. He only played centerfield in 2008. Following the season he played winter baseball in the Dominican Professional Baseball League, where he struggled. Although in 2008 Baseball America projected Venable as an every day starter for the Padres in 2010, some experts questioned whether he would be a long-term solution in center field for the team. Venable started the 2009 season with the Padres' Triple-A affiliate, Portland Beavers, but he was recalled by the Padres on June 3. His father, Max, served as the Beavers' hitting coach in 2009. Following the July 5 trade of Scott Hairston to the Oakland Athletics, Venable shared right field with Kyle Blanks. On July 12 against the San Francisco Giants, he had his first home run of the season in his first career four-hit game. Between July 30 and August 5, he homered in five of seven games. In an August 23 game against the St. Louis Cardinals, he was involved in a bench-clearing incident when Albert Pujols thought he threw an elbow while being tagged out. In 2009, he posted 12 home runs and tallied 38 runs batted in (RBI), while defensively 493.2 of his 643 innings were spent in right field and only 117 in center field. In 2010, he finished 8th in the National League in triples (7), and 9th stolen bases (29). He executed some delayed steals by taking off with the toss back to the mound \\"when neither infielder is covering second and the catcher is nonchalant with the ball after receiving the pitch\\". On April 11 against the Atlanta Braves, he had his first career 5-RBI game, falling a double shy of the first cycle in Padres history. On May 19, Venable moved into the lead off position in the lineup and he fell a home run shy of the franchise's first cycle against the Los Angeles Dodgers, going 4-for-5 at the plate after getting a triple in the 1st inning and a double in the third. On June 23, 25 and 27, Venable hit tie-breaking home runs in Padre victories against the Florida Marlins and Tampa Bay Rays. On July 3, he went on the 15-day disabled list due to back problems. On September 29 against the Chicago Cubs, he stole two potential home runs (from Alfonso Soriano and Aramis Ram√≠rez) on deep fly balls. In the game, he achieved his career-high 10-game hitting streak. He also led National League outfielders with 5 errors. He set new career-highs with 13 home runs and 51 RBI. Again, the majority of his innings were in right field (600.1 of 936.1 innings). He split his remaining time between left field (171.2) and center field (164.1). In 2011, Venable started slowly, hitting only .205 in April and was eventually optioned to the Tucson Padres on May 23 before being recalled on June 9. At the time of his demotion, he had no home runs and a .224 batting average in 134 at-bats. He was recalled after going 16-for-58 with 3 doubles, 3 triples, 3 home runs and 3 stolen bases in 14 games. In one minor league game on May 27 he homered twice against the Salt Lake Bees. On July 20, Venable scored 3 times in the first two innings as the Padres jumped out to a 13‚Äì0 lead against the Florida Marlins. In late July, he missed a few games due to back spasms. On August 10 against the New York Mets, Venable had four hits again missing the cycle by a home run when he posted a second double in a ninth inning at bat. On August 21, Veneble delivered a lead off home run and the game-winning bases-loaded walk-off hit on Trevor Hoffman Day. On September 28, he got his first grand slam home run against the Chicago Cubs off of Ryan Dempster. For the season, his totals dropped to 9 home runs and 44 RBI with the Padres, and he again totaled 7 triples, this time finishing 10th. He played 662.2 of his 793.2 innings in right field. =2012‚Äì2015= In 2012, Venable and Chris Denorfia formed a platoon in right field, with Venable getting most of the starts against right-handed pitchers and batting .270 against them. Venable made 80 starts in right, but appeared in a then-career-high 148 games for the year. When not starting in right, he made occasional starts in center and left field and made 26 pinch- hitting appearances. On May 15, 2012, Venable had a single, double and triple by the fourth inning against the Washington Nationals, but his 4-hit effort again fell short of the franchise's cycle. On May 23, Venable had his sixth career lead off home run and added a single in the second inning and a double in the fourth against the St. Louis Cardinals. He ended up one hit shy of the cycle for the fifth time, this time a triple. On June 3, Venable suffered a strained oblique muscle and left the game, missing four more games with the injury. Venable finished the year batting .264 with 9 home runs and 45 RBI. He collected 8 triples, finishing 9th in the league, and also committed 7 errors, tied for first among NL outfielders. Venable with 2013 Padres Most Valuable Player award Coming into 2013, Venable was again expected to platoon with Denorfia in right, but injuries to center fielder Cameron Maybin and left fielder Carlos Quentin expanded his playing time. He made 68 starts in right and 52 in center and played in a career-high 151 games. Venable entered the season with 401 hits, which was 48 shy of the record for an alumnus of Princeton Tigers Baseball held by Moe Berg. His 46 home runs were already a school best. For the week of August 12 through August 18, 2013, Venable won the National League Player of the Week Award. During the week Venable tied his single-game career high with 4 hits, joined the Padres' 100-steal club, hit a walk-off home run, made a home run stealing catch and surpassed his previous career best hitting streak by 5 to 15. It marked his first Player of the Week Award as he hit .406 (13-for-32) with two home runs, two doubles, a triple and seven runs scored. On September 13, David Hale (Princeton class of 2011) made his major league debut for the Atlanta Braves, and it became the second Princeton vs. Princeton batter-pitcher matchup in major league history. Hale struck out Venable and eight other Padres in his debut for the Braves, setting a franchise debut record. Venable was voted the Padres' Most Valuable Player for the 2013 season by local baseball writers and other members of the media as he became the 8th player in Padres history to record at least 20 home runs and 20 steals in a season. For the year, Venable hit .268 with 22 home runs and a .796 on-base plus slugging, all new career highs. He also stole 22 bases and finished tied for 5th in the league with 8 triples. On September 2, 2013, Venable signed a two-year contract extension with the Padres to keep him in San Diego through the 2015 season. Venable batted .224 with eight home runs in the 2014 season. His batting average, .288 on-base percentage, .325 slugging percentage, and 38 RBIs were all career lows for a full season. During the 2014‚Äì15 offseason, the Padres acquired outfielders Matt Kemp, Justin Upton, and Wil Myers, shifting Venable into a reserve role. For the Padres in 2015, Venable hit .258 with six home runs, 10 doubles, and 11 stolen bases through mid-August. Texas Rangers On August 18, 2015, the Padres traded Venable to the Texas Rangers for catcher Marcus Greene and a player to be named later (PTBNL). The Rangers needed another outfielder to supplement players like Josh Hamilton, who have dealt with injuries in the past. The PTBNL was announced as Jon Edwards on August 21, after Edwards cleared waivers and could be traded. Philadelphia Philles On February 28, 2016, Venable signed a minor league deal with the Cleveland Indians. On March 27, he was released by the Indians. The next day, Venable signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies. On June 11, 2016, Venable opted out of his minor league deal with the Phillies and became a free agent. Los Angeles Dodgers On June 14, 2016, the Los Angeles Dodgers signed Venable and added him to their major league roster. He appeared in six games for the Dodgers and had one hit (a double) in 10 at-bats before he was designated for assignment on June 24. He cleared waivers and accepted an outright assignment to AAA Oklahoma City. On July 1, the Dodgers brought him back to the active roster when Joc Pederson went on the disabled list. The following week he was again designated for assignment and he again accepted an outright assignment to Oklahoma City. He had one hit in 19 at-bats for Los Angeles and played in 46 games for Oklahoma City, where he hit .276. Post playing career On September 6, 2017, he was named a Special Assistant to Chicago Cubs President Theo Epstein. He served as the first base coach of the Chicago Cubs in 2018 and 2019. He was shifted to third base coach for the Cubs, prior to the 2020 season.

It is one of the main trans-national network organizations recognised as a representative of African indigenous peoples in dialogues with governments and bodies such as the UN. , IPACC was composed of 150 member organisations in 21 African countries. Indigenous characteristics in the African setting IPACC identifies several key characteristics associated with indigenous claims in Africa: * political and economic marginalisation rooted in colonialism; * de facto discrimination based often on the dominance of agricultural peoples in the State system (e.g. lack of access to education and health care by hunters and herders); * the particularities of culture, identity, economy and territoriality that link hunting and herding peoples to their home environments in deserts and forests (e.g. nomadism, diet, knowledge systems); * some indigenous peoples, such as the San and Pygmy peoples are physically distinct, which makes them subject to specific forms of discrimination. With respect to concerns expressed that identifying some groups and not others as indigenous is in itself discriminatory, IPACC states that it: * \\"...recognises that all Africans should enjoy equal rights and respect. All of Africa‚Äôs diversity is to be valued. Particular communities, due to historical and environmental circumstances, have found themselves outside the state-system and underrepresented in governance...This is not to deny other Africans their status; it is to emphasise that affirmative recognition is necessary for hunter-gatherers and herding peoples to ensure their survival.\\" Activities During the first United Nations International Decade of the World's Indigenous Peoples (1995‚Äì2004), IPACC concentrated on human rights standards and normative instruments, notably the UN Working Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP) and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. In April 2007, IPACC leaders adopted a new strategy and action plan focussing on improving the engagement of indigenous peoples in policies dealing with the environment, natural resources and climate change. The plan of action, adopted in Bujumbura, Burundi sets out its main development goal as follows: Indigenous Peoples of Africa concluded that it is imperative for them to demonstrate convincingly to influence makers and decision makers that indigenous peoples are holders of sophisticated indigenous (traditional) knowledge of the environment which is valuable to national resource management planning. The Bujumbura Action Plan has led to a number of IPACC initiatives to help its member organisations express primarily oral traditional ecological knowledge to decision makers with the help of information communication technology (notably geo-spatial information technology). This has included: an East African programme on Participatory 3 Dimensional Modelling (P3DM) with the Yiaku, Sengwer and Ogiek forest-based indigenous peoples; a southern African programme of formalising the assessment and qualification of traditional San trackers - including training with Cybertracker technology; and a pan-African conference on the relationship between Geospatial Information Technology (GIT), traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and effective advocacy held in Windhoek, Namibia in August 2008. Participatory mapping projects are also under preparation in Niger and Gabon. IPACC co- organised a consultative forum on Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and land Degradation (REDD) with Unissons pour la Promotion des Batwa (UNIPROBA in Burundi) and the World Bank. The IPACC REDD report noted that current insecure land tenure of mobile and indigenous peoples could lead to further displacements if REDD is not implemented with sufficient attention to safeguarding the rights of indigenous peoples as articulated in the 2007 UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The recent IPACC strategy links indigenous knowledge of ecosystems and biodiversity with more classical advocacy for cultural and land rights necessary for the survival of herding and hunting communities. IPACC's environmental strategy is supported by important partnerships with the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA) and UNESCO's Division for Intercultural Dialogue and Cultural Policies. IPACC is a legally recognised cooperating partner and observer with the UN Environmental Programme (UNEP), with UNESCO, with the UN Economic and Social Council, the UN Convention on Biological Diversity Secretariat and with the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR).

It records surfaces (specifically of actors' faces) digitally, by using fluorescent makeup and stereo triangulation, allowing for very detailed digitization and manipulation. The system captures images which are then used to generate dense per frame surface reconstructions. It then generates a temporally coherent mesh by tracking an invisible random pattern fluorescent makeup that is applied to the capture surface. Mova technology was first used in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button for building a realistic 3D face model of Brad Pitt. It has subsequently been used in over 15 feature films and games. However, in recent years it attracted controversy due to a series of lawsuits filed by Perlman over its use in motion pictures such as Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers: Age of Ultron, and Beauty and the Beast.

A first round selection (21st overall) in the 2004 Major League Baseball draft by the Philadelphia Phillies, Golson played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Phillies (2008), Texas Rangers (2009), and New York Yankees (2010‚Äì2011). Professional career Philadelphia Phillies Golson attended John B. Connally High School in Austin, Texas. The Philadelphia Phillies selected Golson from high school with the 21st overall pick in the first round of the 2004 Major League Baseball Draft. After drafting him, the Phillies assigned Golson to their Gulf Coast League affiliate in the rookie leagues. He played in 47 games, accumulating a .295 batting average with eight doubles and five triples. He stole 12 bases, and struck out 54 times in 183 at-bats. Golson's speed became a feature of his game, and went on to steal over 100 bases in five minor-league seasons. In a 2008 interview, Golson said, regarding his success as a base-stealer, that \\"[you've] got to be real observant of what the pitcher is doing, if they fall into patterns, what the catcher is doing, the counts, the game situation‚Äîstuff like that ... but speed is the big thing\\". In his second minor-league season, Golson was promoted to the A-level Lakewood BlueClaws in Lakewood, New Jersey. He continued to accumulate high strikeout numbers, with 106 in 375 at-bats, but he also posted a .264 average, hit 8 triples (a career-high), and stole 25 bases. After the 2005 season, Golson was named the second-best prospect in the Phillies' system by Baseball America, the highest spot he would reach in those rankings. Most of the 2006 season was spent at Lakewood as well, with a late- season promotion to the Clearwater Threshers. Between the two levels, Golson hit .233 and struck out 160 times. He hit 13 home runs and batted in 48 runs. Golson also accumulated 127 hits in 593 plate appearances. Strikeouts continued to plague Golson as he began the 2007 season. Between Clearwater and the Reading Phillies, Golson struck out 173 times in 607 plate appearances. He hit 15 home runs in 2007, with 32 doubles and 5 triples. His .273 average and .426 slugging percentage were a large improvement over the previous year. His prospect ranking dropped from second in the Phillies' system to tenth. Golson batting for the Reading Phillies, Double-A affiliates of the Philadelphia Phillies, in Golson remained at Reading for the 2008 season. A .282 average, 13 home runs, and 18 doubles were enough to catch the eye of the major league club, who called him up to the majors on August 31. He made his debut on September 7, pinch-hitting for catcher Carlos Ruiz. He made several appearances as a late-inning defensive replacement, which was fine with Golson. \\"You can really impact a game, where people will remember stuff ‚Ä¶ if you make a great catch that saves the game, people remember that for a long time.\\" With the Phillies, Golson went 0-for-6 in the last month of the 2008 season, scoring two runs and stealing a base. Golson was not part of the postseason roster for the 2008 Phillies, who went on to win the World Series, but he did travel with the team and was in uniform for all the club's playoff games. Texas Rangers On November 20, 2008, Golson was traded by the Phillies to the Texas Rangers for John Mayberry, Jr. Phillies general manager Rub√©n Amaro, Jr. called the trade a speed-for-power' swap\\". Golson received one at-bat for the Rangers in 2009, spending most of his season at the AAA level with the Oklahoma RedHawks. In 146 plate appearances, Golson accumulated a .289 average with five doubles and three triples. He also stole six bases and scored fourteen runs in the opening two months. New York Yankees On January 26, 2010, Golson was traded to the New York Yankees in exchange for minor league player Mitch Hilligoss and cash, after being designated for assignment by the Texas Rangers a few days earlier. Golson was used as primarily a defensive replacement. On September 14 against the Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field, Golson astonished players and spectators with a strong throw when threw out the speedy Carl Crawford in an attempt to reach third base after tagging up for the final out of the game. Golson would later be included on the Yankees' 2010 postseason roster until the team lost the 2010 ALCS to the Texas Rangers. He spent most of the 2011 season with the Yankees' AAA affiliate, the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees. He was released prior to the Rule 5 draft that offseason.

Sign marking La Casa Alvarado For more than 120 years, the house had only three owners. It remained in the Alvardo family from 1840 to 1886, when it was purchased and occupied by Dr. Benjamin S. Nichols and his family. Prior to 1900, Dr. Nichols added redwood frame additions to the house; of the 14 rooms in the house, five are part of the original adobe. The house remained in the Nichols family for 65 years. In 1951, Alphonse and Isabel Fages purchased the home. Alphonse was born in Pomona and a descendant of Ricardo Vejar, who in 1837 was the co-grantee of the Rancho San Jose along with Ygnacio Palomares. Isabel was also the descendant of Spanish settlers and had served as the president of the Historical Society of Pomona Valley and the editor of the official publication of the Native Sons and Daughters of the Golden West. The Fages bought the adobe with plans to restore and preserve it. The house originally included two-and-a-half acres of land, but the Fages sold several lots reducing it to approximately one acre. Historic designation In 1954, the Native Daughters of the Golden West declared the Casa Alvarado to be a historic landmark and dedicated a historical marker on the site. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Though designated as a historic site, the Casa Alvarado remains a private home and is not open to the public. It is currently for sale (November 2009).

As with other tooth fungi, the spores are produced on spines on the underside of the cap, rather than gills. It has a funnel-shaped cap, typically between 2 and 7 cm (0.8‚Äì2.8 in) in diameter, which has characteristic concentric zones of color. The cap may also have radial ridges extending from the center to the margins. The spines are pink in young specimens, but turn brown with age. This species is very similar in appearance to Hydnellum scrobiculatum, and traditionally, largely unreliable microscopic characteristics such as spore size and ornamentation have been used to distinguish between the two. Recent research has demonstrated a way to discriminate the two species using DNA sequencing of the ITS regions.

He was a major editor of classical texts and produced many incunabular editiones principes (first editions). In his hands the preface was expanded from its former role as a private letter to a patron, to become a public lecture, and at times a bully pulpit.Bussi's prefazioni have been collected and edited by M. Miglio, Prefazioni alle edizioni di Sweynheim e Pannartz, prototipografi romani, 1978. Bussi was a Platonist and a friend of Nicholas Cusanus and Johannes Bessarion, in whose philosophical circle he moved. From 1458 to the Cardinal's death in 1464 he had served Cusanus as a secretary at Rome, where he helped his master edit a ninth-century manuscript of the Opuscula and other works of Apuleius.Julia Haig Gaisser, The Fortunes of Apuleius and the Golden Ass: A Study in Transmission and Reception (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2008), pp. 160-62. The Apuleius was printed in 1469. From 1468 Bussi was the chief editor for the printing house of prototypographers Conrad Sweynheym and Arnold Pannartz after they moved it from Subiaco to Rome. He also heaped praise on Cusanus and Bessarion and used his dedicatory preface to Apuleius to laud Bessarion's Defensio Platonis.\\"Defense of Plato\\". He also incorporated an edition of Alcinous translated by Pietro Balbi into his printing of Apuleius. The preface to this version elicited a correspondence with George of Trebizond and his son Andreas. Andreas attacked Bussi and Bessarion in a letter entitled Platonis Accusatio and Bussi directed a response to Andreas in the preface to his edition of Strabo. The debate lasted until 1472. Cusanus, in his dialogue De non aliud of 1462, calls Bussi an expert on the Parmenides of Plato.Pasquale Arf√©, \\"The Annotations of Nicolaus Cusanus and Giovanni Andrea Bussi on the Asclepius\\", Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, 62 (1999), p. 50. Cusanus and Bussi edited William of Moerbeke's translation of the Expositio in Parmenidem of Proclus, and the marginalia they wrote into Cusanus' codex has even been published. The two also edited by hand the Asclepius of Hermes Trismegistus. While Cusanus writes in a Gothic script, Bussi uses a cursive Humanist minuscule.Arf√©, p. 51. While Cusanus wrote lengthy marginal notes, Bussi preferred to keep those to a minimum and emend the text directly. The philology he used in his emendations, however, has been completely dismissed by modern scholarship and his attempted clarifications have been criticised as \\"rash\\" and \\"unfortunate\\".Arf√©, p. 52, quoting Paul Thomas (t√©m√©raire ... malheureuse). Bussi also produced for Sweynheym and Parnnatz editions of the Epistolae of Jerome (1468), the Natural History of Pliny the Elder (1470), the complete works of Cyprian (1471), and the works of Aulus Gellius. Though his edition of Pliny was not the first (a 1469 printing at Venice preceded it), nonetheless it was criticised by Niccol√≤ Perotti in a letter to Francesco Guarneri, secretary of cardinal-nephew Marco Barbo.John Monfasani, \\"The First Call for Press Censorship: Niccolo Perotti, Giovanni Andrea Bussi, Antonio Moreto, and the Editing of Pliny's Natural History\\", Renaissance Quarterly, 41:1 (Spring, 1988), p. 3. Perotti attacks Bussi's practice, then common, of adding one's own preface to an ancient text, and also the quality and accuracy of his editing.Monfasani, pp. 7-8. Bussi dedicated most of his editions to Pope Paul II, whom he served as the first papal librarian, as Perotti assumed his former position as press editor for Sweynheym and Parnnatz (1473). In 1472 he requested assistance for Sweynheym and Pannartz from Pope Sixtus IV, since the printers, who typically published 275 copies in a single edition, had an enormous unsold stock.Stephan F√ºssel, Douglas Martin (trans.), Gutenberg and the Impact of Printing (Ashgate Publishing, 2005), p. 61.

He was a sickly infant who early on began to exhibit the tics that would influence how people viewed him in his later years. From childhood he displayed great intelligence and an eagerness for learning, but his early years were dominated by his family's financial strain and his efforts to establish himself as a school teacher. After a year spent studying at Pembroke College, Oxford, Johnson was forced to leave by lack of financial support. He tried to find employment as a teacher, but was unable to secure a long-term position. In 1735 he married Elizabeth \\"Tetty\\" Porter, a widow 20 years older than himself, and the responsibilities of this marriage made him determined to succeed as an educator. He established his own school, but the venture was unsuccessful. Thereafter, leaving his wife behind in Lichfield, he moved to London, where he spent the rest of his life. In London he began writing essays for The Gentleman's Magazine, and also befriended Richard Savage, a notorious rake and aspiring poet who claimed to be the disavowed son of a nobleman. Eventually he wrote the Life of Mr Richard Savage, his first successful literary biography. He also wrote the powerful poem London, an 18th-century version of Juvenal's Third Satire, as well as the tragic drama Irene, which was not produced until 1749, and even then was not successful. Johnson began his literary career as a minor Grub Street hack writer, but he went on to make lasting contributions to English literature as a poet, essayist, moralist, novelist, literary critic, biographer, editor and lexicographer. His early works, especially London and Life of Mr Richard Savage, contain Johnson's emerging views on biography, morality, and literature in general. Parents Portrait of Michael Johnson Johnson's parents were Michael Johnson, a bookseller, and his wife, Sarah Ford. Michael was the first bookseller of reputation in the Staffordshire community of Lichfield. He also owned a parchment factory, which allowed him to produce his own books. Little is known of his background, except that he and his brothers were apprenticed as booksellers. Michael's father, William Johnson, was described as a \\"yeoman\\" and a \\"gentleman\\" in the Stationers' Company records, but there is little evidence to suggest that he was from a noble family. William was the first Johnson to move to Lichfield and died shortly thereafter. Michael Johnson, after leaving his apprenticeship at 24, followed in his father's footsteps and took up a job selling books on Sadler Street, Lichfield. Three years later Michael Johnson became warden of a charity known as the Conduit Lands Trust, and shortly afterwards was made churchwarden of St Mary's church. At the age of 29, Michael Johnson was engaged to be married to a local woman, Mary Neild, but she cancelled the engagement. Twenty years later, in 1706, he married Sarah Ford. She came from a middle-class milling and farming family and was twelve years his junior, daughter of Cornelius Ford. Although both families had money, Samuel Johnson often claimed that he grew up in poverty. It is uncertain what happened between the marriage of his parents and Samuel's birth three years later to provoke a decline in the family's fortunes, but Michael Johnson quickly became overwhelmed with debt from which he was never able to recover. Childhood Johnson's birthplace in Market Square, Lichfield Johnson was born in Lichfield at 4:00 pm on Wednesday, 18 September 1709 at the family home above his father's bookshop, near Market Square, across from St Mary's Church. His mother was 40 when she gave birth, a matter for sufficient concern that George Hector, a \\"man-midwife\\" and a surgeon of \\"great reputation\\", was brought in to assist during the birth. The baby was named Samuel, after Sarah's brother Samuel Ford. He did not cry and, with doubts surrounding the newborn's health, his aunt claimed \\"that she would not have picked such a poor creature up in the street\\". As it was feared the baby might die, the vicar of St Mary's was summoned to perform a baptism. Two godfathers were chosen: Samuel Swynfen, a physician and graduate of Pembroke College, and Richard Wakefield, a lawyer, coroner, and Lichfield town clerk. Johnson's health improved and he was placed in the nursing care of Joan Marklew. During this period he contracted what is believed to have been scrofula, known at that time as the \\"King's Evil\\". Sir John Floyer, a former physician to King Charles II, recommended that the young Johnson should receive the \\"royal touch\\", which he received from Queen Anne on 30 March 1712 at St James's Palace. Johnson was given a ribbon in memory of the event, which he claimed to have worn for the rest of his life. However, the ritual was ineffective and an operation was performed that left him with permanent scarring across his face and body. Sarah later gave birth to a second boy, Nathaniel. Having two children put financial strain on the family; Michael was unable to keep on top of the debts he had accumulated over the years, and his family was no longer able to maintain the lifestyle it had previously enjoyed. Johnson demonstrated signs of great intelligence as a child, and his parents, to his later disgust, took pleasure in showing off his \\"newly acquired accomplishments\\". His education began at the age of three, when his mother had him memorise and recite passages from the Book of Common Prayer. When Johnson turned four, he was sent to a nearby \\"school\\" on Dam Street, where \\"Dame\\" Anne Oliver, the proprietor, gave lessons to young children in the living-room of a cottage. Johnson especially enjoyed his time with Dame Oliver, later remembering her fondly. At the age of six he was sent to a retired shoemaker to continue his education, and a year later was enrolled at Lichfield Grammar School; he excelled in Latin under Humphrey Hawkins, his teacher in the lower school. Engraving of the Lichfield Grammar School During this time Johnson began exhibiting the tics that would influence how others viewed him in his later years, and which formed the basis for his posthumous diagnosis of Tourette syndrome (TS). TS develops in childhood; it follows a fairly reliable course in terms of the age of onset and the history of the severity of symptoms. Tics may appear up to the age of eighteen, but the most typical age of onset is from five to seven. Johnson's tics and gesticulations manifested after his childhood scrofula; studies suggest that environmental and infectious factors‚Äîwhile not causing Tourette's‚Äîcan affect the severity of the disorder. Pearce describes Johnson's birth as a \\"very difficult and dangerous labour\\", and adds that Johnson had many illnesses throughout his life: he \\"suffered from bouts of melancholy, crushing guilt, habitual insomnia, and he endured a morbid fear of loneliness and of dying.\\" He also was \\"disturbed by scruples of infidelity\\" from the age of 10. Although TS caused problems in his private and public life, it lent Johnson \\"great verbal and vocal energy\\". He excelled in his education and was promoted to the upper school at the age of nine, to be tutored by Edward Holbrooke. The school was directed by the Reverend John Hunter, a man known for his scholarship and, like Holbrooke, his brutality, which caused Johnson to become dissatisfied with his education.; However, during this time he did befriend Edmund Hector, nephew of his \\"man-midwife\\" George Hector, and John Taylor, both of whom he remained in contact with throughout his life. Cornelius Ford At the age of 16, Johnson was given the opportunity to stay with his cousins, the Fords, at Pedmore, Worcestershire. There he bonded with Cornelius Ford, the son of his mother's brother, and Ford employed his knowledge of the classics to tutor Johnson while he was not attending school. Johnson enjoyed his time with Ford, who encouraged Johnson to pursue his studies and to become a man of letters. Johnson remembered one moment of Ford's teachings: Ford told him to \\"grasp the leading praecognita of all things... grasps the trunk hard only, and you will shake all the branches\\". Ford was a successful, well-connected academic, familiar with many society figures such as Alexander Pope. Ford was also a notorious alcoholic whose excesses contributed to his death six years after Johnson's visit. This event deeply affected Johnson, and he remembered Ford in his Life of Fenton, saying that Ford's abilities, \\"instead of furnishing convivial merriments to the voluptuous and dissolute, might have enabled him to excel among the virtuous and the wise\\". Having spent six months with his cousins, Johnson returned to Lichfield, but Hunter, \\"angered by the impertinence of this long absence\\", refused to allow him to continue at the grammar school. Gilbert Walmesley Unable to return to Lichfield Grammar School, Johnson was enrolled, with the help of Ford and his half-brother Gregory Hickman, into the King Edward VI Grammar School at Stourbridge. The headmaster was John Wentworth, and he took care to work with Johnson on his translation exercises. Because the school was located near Pedmore, Johnson was able to spend more time with the Fords and get to know his other relatives in the area. During this time he began writing poems and produced many verse translations. However, he spent only six months at Stourbridge before returning once again to his parents' home in 1727. When Boswell was writing his Life of Samuel Johnson, he was told by Johnson's school friend Edmund Hector Johnson's leaving the Stourbridge school was due in part to a fight Johnson and Wentworth had over Latin grammar. For companionship, Johnson spent time with Hector and John Taylor, two of his schoolfriends, and he soon fell in love with Hector's younger sister, Ann. This first love was not to last, and Johnson later claimed to Boswell, \\"She was the first woman with whom I was in love. It dropped out of my head imperceptibly, but she and I shall always have a kindness for each other.\\" Johnson's future now began to look uncertain, as his father was deeply in debt. To earn money, Johnson stitched books for his father, although poor eyesight‚Äîa result of his childhood illness‚Äîmeant he eschewed the work involved. It is possible that Johnson spent most of his time in his father's bookshop reading various works and building his literary knowledge. During this time, Johnson met Gilbert Walmesley, the Registrar of the Ecclesiastical Court and a frequent visitor to the bookshop. Walmesley took a liking to Johnson, and the two discussed various intellectual topics during the two years Johnson spent working in the shop. Their relationship was soon put on hold; Sarah Johnson's cousin, Elizabeth Harriotts, died in February 1728 and left her ¬£40 (about ¬£ as of ), which was used to send Johnson back to school. College On 31 October 1728, a few weeks after he turned 19, Johnson entered Pembroke College, Oxford as a fellow-commoner. The inheritance did not cover all of his expenses at Pembroke, but Andrew Corbet, a friend and student at Pembroke, offered to make up the deficit. Corbet left Pembroke soon after Johnson arrived, so this source of aid disappeared. To meet the expenses, Michael Johnson allowed his son to borrow a hundred books from his bookshop, at a great cost to himself, and these books were not fully returned to Michael until many years later. Entrance of Pembroke College, Oxford On the day of Johnson's entrance interview for Pembroke, his anxious father introduced him to his future tutor, William Jorden, hoping to make an impression. During the interview, his father was \\"very full of the merits of his son, and told the company he was a good scholar, and a poet, and wrote Latin verses\\", which caused Johnson significant embarrassment. Michael's praise was unnecessary; Johnson's interview went so well that one of the interviewers, a 26-year-old William Adams (Jorden's cousin, later Master of Pembroke), claimed that Johnson was \\"the best qualified for the University that he had ever known come there\\". Throughout the interview, Johnson sat quietly while listening to his father and the interviewers, until he interrupted and quoted Macrobius. The interviewers were surprised that \\"a School-boy should know Macrobius\\", and he was accepted immediately. At Pembroke, Johnson made many friends, but neglected many of the mandatory lectures, and ignored calls for poems. He did complete one poem, the first of his tutorial exercises, on which he spent comparable time, and which provoked surprise and applause. He was later asked by his tutor to produce a Latin translation of Alexander Pope's Messiah as a Christmas exercise. Johnson completed half of the translation in one afternoon and the rest the following morning. Although the poem brought him praise, it did not bring the material benefit he had hoped for. The poem was brought to Pope's attention; according to Sir John Hawkins, Pope claimed that he could not tell if it was the original or not. However, Johnson's friend John Taylor dismissed this \\"praise\\" because Johnson's father had already published the translation before Johnson sent a copy to Pope, and Pope could have been remarking about it being a duplication of the published edition. Regardless, Pope remarked that the work was very finely done, but that did not prevent Johnson from being violently angry at his father's actions in preempting his sending Pope a copy of the poem. The poem later appeared in Miscellany of Poems (1731), edited by John Husbands, a Pembroke tutor, and is the earliest surviving publication of any of Johnson's writings. Johnson spent the rest of his time studying, even over the Christmas vacation. He drafted a \\"plan of study\\" called \\"Adversaria\\", which was left unfinished, and used his time to learn French while working on his knowledge of Greek. Although he later praised Jorden, Johnson came to odds with him over what he considered to be Jorden's \\"meanness\\" of abilities. He discouraged his friend Taylor, who came to Pembroke in March, from having Jorden as his tutor, and Taylor was soon encouraged to go to Christ Church to be taught by Edmund Bateman. Johnson appreciated Bateman's skill as a lecturer, and he would often travel to meet Taylor to discuss the lectures. However, Johnson lacked the funds to even replace his shoes, and so he started to make the journey barefoot. In response, those of Christ Church began to mock Johnson, and he soon kept to his own room for the rest of his time at Pembroke, with Taylor visiting him instead. After thirteen months, poverty forced Johnson to leave Oxford without taking a degree, and he returned to Lichfield. During his last weeks at Oxford, Jorden left Pembroke, and Johnson was given William Adams as a tutor in his place. He enjoyed Adams as a tutor, but by December, Johnson was already a quarter behind in his student fees, and he was forced to return home. He left behind many of the books that his father had previously lent him, both because he could not afford the expense of transporting all of them and as a symbolic gesture that he hoped to return to the school soon. Early career There is little record of Johnson's life between the end of 1729 and 1731; he most likely lived with his parents when experiencing bouts of mental anguish and physical pains. After these years of illness, his tics and gesticulations associated with TS became more noticeable and were \\"commented on by many observers\\". To further complicate Johnson's life, his father was deeply in debt by 1731 and had lost much of his standing in Lichfield. An usher's position became available at Stourbridge Grammar School, but Johnson's lack of a degree saw him passed over, on 6 September 1731. Instead, he stayed at the home of Gregory Hickman, Cornelius Ford's half brother, writing poetry. It was there that he heard the devastating news that Cornelius had died in London, on 22 August 1731; later, in his personal \\"Annales\\", he pointed to that moment as one of the most important of his life. At about the same time, Johnson's father became ill; he developed an \\"inflammatory fever\\" by the end of the year. He died in December 1731 and was buried at St Michael on Greenhill, Lichfield on 7 December 1731. He left no will, and Johnson received only ¬£20 from Michael's estate of ¬£60 (¬£ as of ). In an act \\"almost like religious penance\\", Johnson honoured his father's memory 50 years later by returning to his bookstall in Uttoxeter to make amends for his refusal to work the stall while his father lay dying. Richard Warner kept Johnson's account of the scene: Johnson eventually found employment as undermaster at a school in Market Bosworth, Leicestershire. He was paid ¬£20 a year (¬£ as of ), enough to support himself. The school was run by Sir Wolstan Dixie, 4th Baronet, who allowed Johnson to teach even though he did not have a degree. The unconventional Dixie allowed Johnson to live in his own mansion, Bosworth Hall. Although the arrangement may seem congenial, Johnson was treated as \\"a kind of domestick chaplain, so far, at least, as to say grace at table, but was treated with what he represented as intolerable harshness; and, after suffering for a few months such complicated misery, he relinquished a situation which all his life afterwards he recollected with the strongest aversion, and even a degree of horrour\\". Still, Johnson found pleasure in teaching even though he thought it boring. By June 1732, he had returned home, and, after a fight with Dixie, quit the school. Johnson spent the rest of his time at Lichfield looking for a position at the other local schools, and, after being turned down for a position in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, he spent his time with his friend, Hector. Hector lived in the home of Thomas Warren, on High Street, Birmingham, and Johnson was invited to stay there as a guest in the autumn of 1732. Warren was at that time starting his Birmingham Journal, and he enlisted Johnson's help, although no copies of the essays he wrote for the paper now survive. His stay with Hector and Warren was not to last, and Johnson moved into the house of a man named Jarvis on 1 June 1733. During this time, Johnson started to slip into a \\"state of 'absence and he began to treat his friends with \\"abuse\\". His connection with Warren continued to grow, and Johnson proposed to translate Jer√≥nimo Lobo's account of the Abyssinians. Johnson read Abbe Joachim Le Grand's French translations, and he thought that a shorter version might be \\"useful and profitable\\". He began work on the edition and a finished section was taken to be printed during the winter of 1733‚Äì1734. Johnson's nerves got the best of him, and after a breakdown he was unable to continue working, but felt obligated to meet his contract. To finish the rest, Johnson dictated directly to Hector, who then took the copy to the printer and made any corrections. It amounted to a month's work, and, a year later, his A Voyage to Abyssinia was finally published. Johnson returned to Lichfield in February 1734, where he began an annotated edition of Poliziano's Latin poems, along with a history of Latin poetry from Petrarch to Poliziano. The work was designed to fill 480 pages and provide a detailed commentary and corresponding notes. By completing such a work as this, Johnson hoped to become known as a scholar-poet similar to Julius Caesar Scaliger, Daniel and Nikolaes Heinsius, Desiderius Erasmus, and Poliziano, all of whom Johnson admired. Johnson began on 15 June 1743 and printed a Proposal for the work on 5 August 1734. However, the project did not receive enough funds and it was soon brought to an end. Although the project failed, it shows that Johnson identified himself with neo-Latin humanism. Marriage Mrs. Samuel Johnson by Maria Verelst Johnson identified himself as a poet and, in November 1734, applied to Edward Cave to work on the poetry reviews for The Gentleman's Magazine. In a letter written under the name S. Smith, Johnson said, \\"As You appear no less sensible than Your Readers of the defects of your Poetical Article, You will not be displeased, if, in order to the improvement of it, I communicate to You the sentiments of a person, who will undertake on reasonable terms sometimes to fill a column\\". In particular, Johnson suggested removing the magazine's \\"low Jests\\" and \\"awkward Buffoonery\\" and then replacing them with poems, inscriptions, and \\"short literary Dissertations in Latin or English\\" written by himself. Cave did not accept Johnson's proposal to write a column, but he did employ Johnson occasionally to work on minor aspects of the periodical. Around this time, Johnson became close to a man named Harry Porter, and remained with him during his terminal illness. Porter died on 3 September 1734, leaving his wife Elizabeth (n√©e Jervis, and nicknamed \\"Tetty\\") widowed at the age of 45, with three children. Months later, Johnson began to court the widow; Reverend William Shaw claims that \\"the first advances probably proceeded from her, as her attachment to Johnson was in opposition to the advice and desire of all her relations\\". Johnson and Elizabeth became close, and they quickly fell in love. She admired Johnson greatly and claimed that he was \\"the most sensible man that I ever saw in my life\\". Johnson was inexperienced in relationships, but the well-to-do widow encouraged him and provided for him with her substantial savings. The two were married on 9 July 1735, at St Werburgh's Church in Derby. The Porter family did not approve of the match, partly because Johnson was 25 and Elizabeth was 21 years his elder. His mother's marriage to Johnson so disgusted her son Jervis that he stopped talking to her. Her other son Joseph later accepted the marriage, and her daughter, Lucy, accepted Johnson from the start. Edial Hall During the previous June while working as a tutor for Thomas Whitby's children, Johnson had applied for the position of headmaster at Solihull School. Walmesley lent his support to Johnson's application, but Johnson was passed over because the school's directors thought he was \\"a very haughty, ill-natured gent., and that he has such a way of distorting his face (which though he can't help) the gent[s] think it may affect some lads\\". He was also rejected for a position at a school in Brewood for similar reasons. Johnson did not give up his ambition to teach; with Walmesley's encouragement, he decided to set up his own school. Edial Hall School In the autumn of 1735, Johnson opened a private academy at Edial, near Lichfield. The building, Edial Hall, was a large house with a pyramid-shaped roof and a unique design; a back room served as the schoolroom while the rest housed Johnson's family. He had only three pupils, David Garrick, George Garrick and Lawrence Offley; David Garrick‚Äî18 at the time‚Äîwent on to become one of the most famous actors of his day. Johnson designed a curriculum that focused on the reading of classical literature, starting with what he considered to be easier works, such as those by Corderius and Erasmus, before slowly progressing to Cornelius Nepos and finally onto Ovid, Vergil, and Horace. The school was advertised in the June and July 1736 editions of The Gentleman's Magazine: \\"At Edial, near Litchfield, in Staffordshire, Young Gentlemen are Boarded, and Taught the Latin and Greek Languages, by Samuel Johnson\\". After being open for little more than a year, the school failed in February 1737, gaining Johnson a reputation as a failed schoolmaster. He slowly abandoned his desire to teach to focus more on writing his first major work, the historical tragedy Irene. The play did not earn him the money he had hoped for, though, until Garrick produced it in 1749. On 2 March 1737, penniless, Johnson left for London with his former pupil David Garrick. To make things worse, Johnson received word that his brother had died on the day they left. However, their prospects were not completely hopeless, as Garrick was set to inherit a large sum the next year. Also, Garrick had connections in London, and the two would stay with his distant relative, Richard Norris, who lived on Exeter Street. Johnson did not stay there long, and set out for Greenwich near the Golden Hart Tavern to finish Irene. During that time, he wrote to Cave on 12 July 1737 and proposed a translation for Paolo Sarpi's The History of the Council of Trent (1619), which Cave did not accept until months later.; Johnson started working on the translation of Sarpi before Cave approved, and he returned home to his wife during this time. In all, he managed to write between four hundred and eight hundred pages of text with corresponding commentary before he stopped working on it in April 1739. In October 1737, Johnson brought his wife to London; they first lived at Woodstock Street and then moved to 6 Castle Street. Soon, Johnson found employment with Cave, and wrote for his The Gentleman's Magazine. His work for the magazine and other publishers during this time \\"is almost unparalleled in range and variety\\", and \\"so numerous, so varied and scattered\\" that \\"Johnson himself could not make a complete list\\". Title page of London second edition In May 1738, his first major work, a poem called London, was published anonymously. The work was based on Juvenal's Third Satire and describes the character Thales's leaving for Wales to escape the problems of London. In particular, the poem describes how London is a place of crime, corruption, and the neglect of the poor. Johnson could not bring himself to regard the poem as granting him any merit as a poet; however, Alexander Pope claimed that the author \\"will soon be d√©terr√©\\" (brought to light, become well known), although it did not immediately happen. In August, Johnson was denied a position as master of the Appleby Grammar School because a master's degree from Oxford or Cambridge was required. To ensure that he would not suffer rejection again, Pope asked John Gower, a man with influence in the Appleby community, to have a degree awarded to Johnson. Gower attempted to have a degree awarded to Johnson from Oxford, but he was told that it was \\"too much to be asked.\\" Gower then wrote to a friend of Jonathan Swift to persuade him to use his influence at the University of Dublin to have a masters awarded to Johnson, which could then be used to justify a masters awarded to Johnson from Oxford. However, Swift refused to act on Johnson's behalf. Regardless of Swift's motivation in not acting on Johnson's behalf, or how Johnson reacted to Swift's actions, it is known that Johnson then after refused to appreciate Swift as a poet, writer, or a satirist, with one exception: Swift's Tale of a Tub, of which Johnson doubted Swift's authorship. Between 1737 and 1739, Johnson became close to Richard Savage. Feeling guilty for his own poverty, Johnson stopped living with his wife and spent time with Savage. Together, they would roam the streets at night without enough money to stay in taverns or sleep in \\"night- cellars\\". Savage was both a poet and a playwright, and Johnson was reported to enjoy spending time and discussing various topics with him, along with drinking and other merriment. However, poverty eventually caught up with Savage, and Pope, along with Savage's other friends, gave him an \\"annual pension\\" in return for him agreeing to move to Wales. Savage ended up in Bristol however, and once again fell into debt by reliving his former London lifestyle. He was soon in debtors' prison and died in 1743. A year later, Johnson wrote Life of Mr Richard Savage (1744) at Cave's prompting, and this work formed the beginning of Johnson's long-lasting success. The biography was a \\"moving\\" work that, according to Walter Jackson Bate, \\"remains one of the innovative works in the history of biography\\". Early works Title page of Life of Mr Richard Savage Johnson's early works and early life have been neglected topics within Johnson scholarship. As a result, he is primarily known for the events surrounding his later life and later works like A Dictionary of the English Language. This imbalance originates in the failure of James Boswell, Johnson's friend and companion, to discuss in great detail Johnson's childhood and the beginning of his career within the Life of Samuel Johnson, the most famous biography on Johnson. In particular, Boswell ignored Johnson's early politics and political writings which show a concern with Sir Robert Walpole's political administration. His first major work, the poem London, contains an early version of Johnson's ethics and morality system. Within the poem, he combined attacks on the politics of Walpole and the British government with the immoral actions of the common Londoner to form a general satire of 18th-century London society. Johnson compares London to the Roman Empire in its decline and blames moral and political corruption for its fall. Although Johnson did not start his literary criticism career until later, London is an example of what Johnson thought poetry should be: it is youthful and joyous, but it also relies on simple language and easy to understand imagery. Johnson's first major success came with Life of Savage, but it was not his first biography; Savage was the fourth in a series which also included biographies of Jean-Philippe Baratier, Robert Blake and Francis Drake. Although it was not the only biography that appeared immediately after Savage's death, it became the most popular, and it embodied Johnson's ideas on what a biography should be. The book did contain some inaccuracies, particularly those surrounding Savage's claim that he was the illegitimate child of a nobleman. It was successful in its partial analysis of Savage's poetry and in portraying insights into Savage's personality, but for all of its literary achievements it did not bring immediate fame or income to Johnson or to Cave; it did, though, provide Johnson with a welcome small income at an opportune time in his life. More importantly, the work helped to mould Johnson into a biographical career; it was included in his later Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets series.

Like some of Cierva's designs, the K-2 also featured stubby fixed wings for additional lift, also as a mount for ailerons for lateral control. The pilot and a single passenger sat side by side in an open cockpit, although a folding canopy (similar to that of a convertible automobile) was available as an optional extra.

It is owned by the New York-based Authentic Brands Group. Hart Schaffner Marx is located in Chicago. History The company has roots dating back to 1887, when brothers Harry and Max Hart opened a small men's clothing store on Chicago's State Street,hartschaffnermarx.com About called Harry Hart and Brother. In 1879, the Harts' brothers-in-law, Levi Abt and Marcus Marx, joined the partnership, which was renamed Hart, Abt and Marx. Eight years later, Marx and Abt left the business and were replaced by a cousin, Joseph Schaffner (1848‚Äì1918), (Joseph Schaffner married Sarah Halle in 1888.) (Joseph Halle Schaffner was a nephew of the inventor and philanthropist Hiram Halle. Joseph Halle Schaffner's step-daughter Perugina Adler married a son of the famous surgeon Evarts Ambrose Graham.) and the firm was renamed Hart Schaffner & Marx. At the same time, however, the wholesale business began to grow, overtaking the retail operations. On the strength of wholesale production, Hart, Abt and Marx won contracts to produce clothing for the U.S. military. This introduced the partners to prefabricated off-the-rack clothing and marked their entry into the ready-to-wear suit trade. In 1897, the company began running national advertisements for its products and began selling off-the- rack suits through a variety of distributors. Hart Schaffner & Marx commissioned well-known illustrators, such as John E. Sheridan, to paint pictures for style books and retail posters. These ads portrayed the company's latest fashions in rich surroundings, establishing Hart Schaffner & Marx as a premium brand. Hart Schaffner & Marx advertisement by John E. Sheridan, 1919 By 1906 the company had branched into sizes for men who were unusually tall, short, or overweight. Hart Schaffner & Marx thus became a mass-market brand, enabling virtually any man to have a fine quality suit at a lower price than a custom tailored suit. In 1910, the company was targeted by the Chicago garment workers' strike, also known as the Hart, Schaffner, and Marx strike, which led to improved conditions for workers and the founding of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. On May 10, 1911, after years of steady growth, the partnership was incorporated. During World War I, the company introduced the first tropical worsted suits and the company's facilities were used for making uniforms. In 1926, the company expanded retail operations by acquiring Wallach's, a large New York City-based clothing chain, followed by Chicago retail clothier Baskin the following year. The company again produced uniforms for the military during World War II. During the 1950s and 1960s, the company continued to expand with the acquisition of clothing manufacturer Society Brand, a major manufacturing house in 1952; Hickey Freeman, a premier men's clothing brand and retailer of Rochester, New York, was acquired in 1964; Jaymar-Ruby and Kleinhans in 1967; and, in 1969, M. Wile manufacturer of Buffalo, New York. After these major acquisitions, an antitrust suit against the company led to a consent degree barring any further acquisitions, without court approval, for ten years. A year before the agreement expired, the company acquired Intercontinental Apparel, U.S. licensee of the Pierre Cardin brand. After acquiring Bishop's men's shops, the company expanded into women's clothing, with the 1981 acquisition of the Country Miss chain. The Kuppenheimer Manufacturing Company, retailer of inexpensive suits with 41 retail outlets, was acquired in 1982, for $25.8 million. In 1983, the company changed its name to Hartmarx Corporation, with the new parent company acting as a holding company for various subsidiaries. The company acquired Briar Neckwear in July 1985 and in December 1986 acquired the casual suit jacket manufacturer H. Ortisky. The following year Hart Schaffner & Marx took over the nine-store Detroit retail chain Anton's, and in 1988 purchased Boyd's, a small retail chain in St. Louis, and the Washington, D.C.-based upscale retailer Raleigh's. In February 1989 the company also added the Biltwell Company, a clothing manufacturer. By 1992, the company experienced continuing losses and divested itself of all retail outlets, except the Kuppenheimer chain. The company sold its 91-store Kuppenheimer unit and two tailored clothing factories in 1995. The 1990s was a period of offshoring of production facilities to control costs. During that period, they closed ten domestic factories and shifted production to China, Mexico, and Costa Rica. Expansion continued in this period with the acquisition in late 1996, of bankrupt Plaid Clothing Group, Inc., a maker and marketer of men's tailored suits, sportcoats, and slacks; Pusser's Ltd., including the Pusser's of the West Indies line of nautical and tropical sportswear and outerwear in 1998; and in December 1998; Coppley, Noyes and Randall Limited, a leading Canadian maker of men's tailored clothing. In August of the following year, the company acquired Royal Shirt Company, a Canadian maker of women's and men's dress and sports shirts. The label enjoyed considerable publicity during the 2008 Presidential campaign when then-Senator Barack Obama wore the brand extensively, including suits tailored especially for his acceptance speech and the 2009 Presidential Inaugural Address. Obama expressed a personal affinity for the brand, which is based in his hometown of Chicago. The company and its United States subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy on January 23, 2009. At the time, the company said its Canadian and other non-U.S. affiliates had not sought bankruptcy protection. Workers threatened to occupy Hartmarx's plant if the company's creditor, Wells Fargo Bank, attempted to lay off workers and liquidate the company's assets. On June 22, 2009, Hartmarx Corp. received five bids for its assets in its bankruptcy proceedings. Bidders included Emerisque/SKNL North America, Affliction Clothing Co., Perry Ellis, and Versa Capital Management. In August 2009, Emerisque Brands UK and its partner SKNL North America completed their purchase of Hartmarx. Hart Schaffner & Marx became the flagship brand of HMX Group, a holding company. HMX sold most of its assets to the New York-based Authentic Brands Group in 2012 for an undisclosed price following Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.Dawn McCarty and Michael Bathon, HMX Acquisition Files to Sell Assets to Authentic Brands Bloomberg, October 19, 2012 During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, the Hart Schaffner Marx plant in Des Plaines was closed with 300 furloughed workers. When it reopened, workers sewed thousands of masks for essential workers in Chicago and the public. Branding The Hart Schaffner Marx premium brands dated back to the turn of the 20th Century and included Hart Schaffner & Marx and Hickey-Freeman, but it was not until one night in 1966 that branding became a significant factor in company growth. That evening, television host Johnny Carson walked on stage to deliver his nightly Tonight Show monologue wearing a turtleneck sweater and a collarless Nehru jacket. Because of the overwhelming popularity of the style, Hart Schaffner & Marx entered into an agreement to market a new casual line of suits under the Johnny Carson name and, later, under the premium Bobby Jones and Jack Nicklaus brands. Hart Schaffner & Marx introduced the Austin Reed brand name during the 1960s. In 1974 the company rolled out a line of tailored clothing under the Christian Dior name, followed by Nino Cerruti, Allyn St. George, and Playboy. These new lines were created under contract to their designer namesakes and proved highly successful as fashion leaders. In 1979, Pierre Cardin was added to the distinguished list of designers. In the late 1990s, two new lines, Perry Ellis and Daniel Hechter, were introduced; the latter was positioned within the popular-priced segment and the former resided within the moderate sector. The Tommy Hilfiger line was also introduced as business casual wear. In 1996, with the acquisition of Plaid Clothing Group, Inc., brands including Burberry, Liz Claiborne, Evan-Picone, Palm Beach, and Brannoch were added to the Hartmarx stable.

In the months leading up to the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, Fung coached Japanese wheelchair fencer Toyoaki Hisakawa in preparation for the games. In recent years, he started participating in wheelchair marathon. He completed his first full marathon in Osaka, Japan in 2011. Then in 2012, he completed the Standard Chartered Hong Kong Marathon and was the first local wheelchair racer to complete the entire course. In 2013, he won the wheelchair half-marathon for the same event. He hopes that the increasing profile of wheelchair events locally can provide more opportunities and choices to the athletes with disabilities in Hong Kong.

P√≥voa de Varzim City Center or Downtown P√≥voa de Varzim (Portuguese, Centro) is the heart of P√≥voa de Varzim in Portugal, and is the location for most of the city's municipal services, tourist attractions and businesses. It is the center, not only for the city or the municipality, but also neighboring municipalities. The greater downtown area also called \\"Centro\\" can also include most districts part of P√≥voa de Varzim Parish. Downtown, as defined by the City Hall, is arranged around Pra√ßa do Almada, the civic center, and extends in all directions for a number of blocks, including Junqueira shopping street, Passeio Alegre waterfront square, Mouzinho de Albuquerque business avenue, and Pra√ßa Marqu√™s de Pombal (market square). It does not include the medieval and Discovery Age civic center of the city which is located in Bairro da Matriz district. Despite proven to be occupied at least since the Roman period, Downtown developed its current layout in the 18th century, by royal order of Queen Mary I of Portugal due to the importance that P√≥voa de Varzim got as the main seaport in Northern Portugal. Urban morphology P√≥voa de Varzim City Center within P√≥voa de Varzim urban area. The Rua da Junqueira shopping street. Largo David Alves. Passeio Alegre beachfront. Dores Square. Pillory of P√≥voa de Varzim. Downtown skyline in mid-19th century. Mouzinho de Albuquerque avenue. Downtown is limited to the North by Bairro Norte, to the south by Bairro Sul, to the east by Barreiros/Moninhas and Matriz/Mariadeira and to the west it borders Redonda Beach and P√≥voa Cove. Downtown P√≥voa de Varzim is, to a large extent, made up of pedestrian areas, with difficult car access in much of its extension, although underground parking spaces are available in the waterfront and in Avenida Mouzinho de Albuquerque. Civic Center Pra√ßa do Almada, the civic center, is landscaped in an egg-shape, cut in half by the National Highway 13, and is tipped by buildings with local style. The building of the City Hall (1791) dominates the square. In the square, the Manueline pillory of P√≥voa de Varzim (1514) is a national monument and represents P√≥voa de Varzim's self-government and laws. Next to the pillory, the romantic gazebo (1904) follows the liking of the old Povoan bourgeoisie for its spare time.Coreto da Pra√ßa do Almada - IGESPAR Junqueira shopping district Despite being pedestrian, Rua da Junqueira is the most famous and elder of those three streets. Junqueira, which links Pra√ßa do Almada to the waterfront, appeared in the written records in 1694, even though artifacts from the Roman era surfaced in diverse street rearrangements and is the site of an ancient Roman fish factory. In 1839, the Town Hall expressed concerns over urbanization issues due to popularity of this street, one of the busiest in P√≥voa de Varzim, as it became in that century a full-blown shopping street, identity that it maintained to these days in which ancient stores survive. Undersized but charismatic squares in Junqueira district, between Pra√ßa do Almada and Passeio Alegre (waterfront) can be found: Pra√ßa da Rep√∫blica and Largo David Alves. Old theater area From the surroundings of Pra√ßa do Almada, three parallel streets lead to the waterfront: Rua Tenente Valadim, that ends between the Casino and Grande Hotel, Rua da Junqueira and Rua Santos Minho. The later is related to the arts, most notably performing arts, since the 18th century. It was a square known as Campo das Cobras and the location of a theater since 1793, the local bullfighting arena and circus. The old building Sal√£o Teatro (Theater Saloon) and Teatro Garrett Theater from the 19th century, with small artist's studios in the way, can still be found. History Albeit inhabited since the Roman period, with Roman fish factories and a Roman villa. The seaport, a natural harbor, appeared in the written records in the 11th century, and the ship- making industry developed considerably in the 17th century, it was in the 18th century, with the fishing industry getting national importance, that defined the city center as it is today, with the Royal Provision by Queen Mary I on February 21, 1791. The queen ordered Corregedor Almada to reorganize the town's layout given P√≥voa's prosperity and importance in the fishing sector. Prior to development the area had lagoons in the port area such as Bo√≠do Lagoon and Gal√© Lagoon. The new civic center (Pra√ßa Nova - New Square) with a new town hall was built in an area used as a market square during some periods in the site of Bo√≠do Lagoon. The square was later renamed Pra√ßa do Almada in honor of Corregedor Almada efforts. The new square replaced the old town hall around Pra√ßa Velha, the Old civic center. Prior to that, Junqueira district was already a bustling fishing quarter. As the 19th century moved in, and beach therapy became popular with the elites, Junqueira became a bourgeois shopping street. In late 19th century and under the visions of David Alves, when P√≥voa de Varzim was already a prosperous beach resort, sections of the urbanized area, which didn't grew in an orderly way, were demolished to give way for Mousinho de Albuquerque Avenue, linking Passeio Alegre Square to uptown's Dores Square (Largo das Dores), where mansions for the wealthy beach goers started being built. During late 20th century, some of the mansions and Orfe√£o Poveiro music hall ruins were destroyed to give rise to multifamily homes. Despite its losses, Mousinho Avenue got a new character, it became a central business avenue and a rehabilitation program was done in the 21st century. Around Rego Square, later David Alves square, appeared some of the most charismatic entertainment venues of P√≥voa in the 19th century, the Hotel Luso-Brazileiro, the Chin√™s Saloon, Garrett Theater, and other entertainment venues. Centering the plaza, the Chin√™s Saloon appeared in 1882 and became popular all over the country and the most famous casino of P√≥voa alongside Caf√© David. The elites could listen to music, see shows with Spanish dancers, meet in tertulia and play roulette. Old bourgeois area par excellence, with the increasing business importance of Junqueira and Pra√ßa do Almada, whose spaces had been taken for tertiary activities such as shops and offices, in such a way that, today, only few people live in the most central areas of the city.As Prociss√µes na P√≥voa de Varzim (1900‚Äì1950).

Rogers College of Law at the University of Arizona has created an academic center for the study of American Indian and indigenous peoples law, policy, and human rights. The Indigenous Peoples Law and Policy (IPLP) Program furthers the research, training, and advocacy of Indian law and international law of indigenous peoples. Courses and clinical opportunities are offered in areas of law and policy concerning indigenous peoples in the United States and around the world. What makes the Indigenous Peoples Law and Policy (IPLP) Program at the University of Arizona Law (Arizona Law) unique is our approach to legal education in the field of federal Indian law, tribal law and policy, and indigenous peoples human rights. Students are trained in the classroom and in real-world settings by faculty who are leaders both in their academic fields and as practitioners in tribal, national, and international forums. Through clinical studies and direct advocacy under the supervision of the world's most distinguished scholars in the field, students and practitioners provide legal and other forms of assistance to local and international indigenous communities. The IPLP Program has been involved in numerous indigenous legal issues around the world. Students and professors in the IPLP Program have assisted Central American Maya villages that have filed lawsuits in the Belize Supreme Court alleging that both the attorney general of Belize and the minister of Natural Resources and Environment had violated their property rights. Faculty and students of the IPLP Program have worked in coordination with other groups representing Carrie Dann and recently deceased Mary Dann, who have struggled against the federal government for decades over Western Shoshone territory, in precedent-setting proceedings before the Organization of American States' Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. It culminated with the Inter-American Commission issuing a report in which it condemned the United States for violating the Dann sisters' human rights. In addition, IPLP Program personnel and affiliates have worked with the people of Awas Tingni, a Mayangna (Sumo) indigenous community located on the Atlantic Coast in Nicaragua, for many years with the landmark case decided by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Mayagna (Sumo) Community of Awas Tingni v.

Carpenter launched the strip in the Anchorage Daily News in his home state of Alaska in 1991. Since then, he has self-syndicated it to over 330 newspapers, an unusually high amount for strips in self-syndication. Early life Chad Carpenter was born in Michigan before moving to Alaska with his family at age two, where his father began a career with the Alaska State Troopers. As that job entailed being transferred to different posts across the state, the family lived in a wide variety of communities, which provided him an opportunity to be immersed in nature as he grew up starting at an early age. In a 2015 interview, he gave a characteristically tongue-in- cheek account of his early life, explaining that he came to Alaska \\"because of all the restraining orders\\", and that on the eve of entering the Alaska State Trooper Academy to follow in his father's footsteps, he decided against it because \\"I knew that I was too goofy to carry a gun\\". In 1988, while in his early 20s, he left Alaska and moved to Sarasota, Florida. While in Sarasota, he met Dik Browne, the creator of H√§gar the Horrible, and Mike Peters, the creator of Mother Goose and Grimm. Both cartoonists advised him; Peters told him to draw what he knew. This inspired Carpenter to create a comic about the nature and wildlife he had come to know so well back in Alaska. Tundra Created in 1991, Tundra is published on a daily basis, always in one of two formats: Either a single-panel gag comic or a three-panel strip with regular characters and more complex humor. This alternation is similar to that used in Mother Goose and Grimm and Non Sequitur. Unlike those strips, Tundra tends to deal with wildlife and the outdoors; its humor appeals to all demographics, young & old. Tundra also occasionally uses reader-submitted ideas. Carpenter still self-syndicates the strip within the United States, and currently appears in over 330 newspapers as a result. Since 2007, the strip has been syndicated internationally by King Features Syndicate. It now appears in newspapers in the United States, Canada, Jamaica, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and Trinidad and Tobago. He has published and sold 20 Tundra books and has also produced extensive amounts of other Tundra-branded merchandise. In May 2008, Tundra was named the best newspaper panel of 2007 by the National Cartoonists Society. In August 2008, Carpenter was presented with a legislative citation honoring him as Alaska's Cartoon Laureate. It was presented to him by Wes Keller, a member of the Alaska House of Representatives. Other art contracts Carpenter's artistic talents have led to his being contracted for projects with the National Association of Search and Rescue, the Alaska State Troopers, the United States Navy, and other companies.  Other work  Carpenter both wrote and produced the 2015 supernatural comedy thriller film Moose the movie together with his brother Darin Carpenter.

In addition to electric power, the plant also produces food-grade carbon dioxide. Design and operation The plant uses fluidized bed combustion (FBC) technology, in which bituminous coal and finely ground limestone are injected, using air, into the boiler. Air keeps the limestone and coal suspended in a fluid-like condition. The limestone reacts with sulfur dioxide, released during combustion of the coal, removing this pollutant from the plant's emissions. With the enhanced sulfur dioxide removal due to the FBC technology, Warrior Run can burn approximately of coal from Maryland each year, which tends to be of a higher sulfur content. During 2007, 100 percent of the coal burned at Warrior Run was mined in Maryland. The FBC boiler operates at a lower temperature compared to other coal-fired boiler technology, reducing production of nitrogen oxides. Injection of ammonia and a selective non-catalytic reduction system are also used to remove nitrogen oxides. A baghouse removes particulates from the plant's air emissions. Water used by the plant is supplied by the City of Cumberland water system. Fly and bottom ash from Warrior Run, which is highly alkaline due to the limestone used by the FBC boiler, is used as fill at four nearby surface coal mines. The plant produces about of ash each year. Warrior Run surcharge Warrior Run became operational on February 10, 2000. As provided by the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, the local utility, the Potomac Edison Company, which is a unit of FirstEnergy, is required to purchase the electric output of Warrior Run at its \\"avoided cost\\" rate under a contract for thirty years. However, this \\"avoided cost\\" rate, which was determined at the time of the contract, is higher than the current wholesale price of electricity, so Potomac Edison recovers the difference in this price through a surcharge on the bills of its customers. This surcharge will end in April 2030. In 2007 the Maryland Public Service Commission approved a plan permitting the Warrior Run electric output to be sold into the PJM Interconnection day-ahead wholesale market and the capacity bid into the PJM forward capacity market, with the proceeds used to reduce the surcharge.Maryland Public Service Commission Case No. 8797, Order No. 81725 (Nov. 28, 2007).

They were organized by businessmen William Hollinger, and J. Ford Evans in 1878 as the Forest Citys, and played a season as an independent team.Purdy, p. 98Egan, p. 88 The NL expanded from six teams to eight before the 1879 season, and the Forest Citys accepted an invitation to join the league. Evans became their president and stayed in that capacity until C. H. Bulkeley assumed the role in 1882.Spink, p. 289 In their six seasons in the NL, the team never finished higher than third place in the standings. They played their home games in League Park. For their first season in the NL, the franchise (now named the Blues due to their dark blue uniforms) employed Jim McCormick as the manager as well as the ace of their pitching staff.Purdy, p. 99 Cleveland did not fare well, winning just 27 games against 55 losses, with a league-low .223 batting average. The 1880 season was better, however, as the team increased its win total to 47 against 37 losses and a tie, McCormick winning a league-leading 45 of those victories. Over the next two seasons, the team changed the on-field leadership often; employing Mike McGeary and John Clapp as player-managers in 1881, and Fred Dunlap in 1882. The changes did not prove effective as the team was unable to finish higher than fifth place during that span. The team had their best record and highest win total in 1883 under manager Frank Bancroft. On September 13, 1883, Hugh Daily threw the franchise's lone no-hitter. An upstart baseball league was created in 1884 by Henry Lucas called the Union Association (UA). Several member of the Blues' signed contracts with teams in the UA despite being subject to the reserve clause: including star players McCormick, Dunlap, and Jack Glasscock. These moves caused the Blues to become financially unstable. However, the franchise was able to secure a deal with the league for a better share of gate receipts.Purdy, p. 100 This deal was not enough for the franchise to profit, and Bulkeley sold the team to Lucas for $2,500 ($ current dollar adjustment) following the conclusion of the 1884 season. Players Doc Bushong was the Blues' starting catcher in 1883 and 1884. John Clapp was the player-manager of the 1883 Blues. Hugh Daily pitched the only no-hitter in franchise history. Fred Dunlap was the player-manager of the 1882 Blues. Jack Glasscock played in each of the Blues' seasons. Hall of Fame manager Ned Hanlon began his playing career with the 1880 team. Jim McCormick was the franchise's all-time leader in pitching wins with 174, and was the team's player-manager from 1879 to 1880. Bill Phillips was the franchise's all-time leader in most batting categories. Orator Shafer was the franchise's starting right fielder for three seasons.

Lonar Lake was created by an asteroid collision with earth impact during the Pleistocene Epoch. It is one of the four known, hyper-velocity, impact craters in basaltic rock anywhere on Earth. The other three basaltic impact structures are in southern Brazil. Lonar Lake has a mean diameter of and is about below the crater rim. The meteor crater rim is about in diameter. Lonar Crater sits inside the Deccan Plateaua massive plain of volcanic basalt rock created by eruptions some 65 million years ago. Its location in this basalt field suggested to some geologists that it was a volcanic crater. Today, however, Lonar Crater is understood to be the result of a meteorite impact that occurred between 35,000 and 50,000 years ago. The water in the lake is both saline and alkaline. Geologists, ecologists, archaeologists, naturalists and astronomers have published studies of various aspects of this crater lake ecosystem. The crater's age is usually estimated to be 52,000 ¬±6,000 years, although a study published in 2010 suggests an age of 570,000 ¬± 47,000 years. The Smithsonian Institution, the United States Geological Survey, Geological Survey of India, the University of Sagar and the Physical Research Laboratory have conducted extensive studies of the site. Biological nitrogen fixation was discovered in this lake in 2007.Avinash A. Raut and Shyam S.

A 2019 study, conducted by IIT Bombay found that the minerals, in the lake soil, are very similar to the minerals found in moon rocks brought back during the Apollo Program.  Geographical features  View of the crater from the edge. A temple is visible in the forest underneath. A series of small hills surround the basin, which has an oval shape, almost round, with a circumference at top of about 8 km (five miles). The sides of the basin rise abruptly at an angle of about 75¬∞. At the base of the sides, the lake has a circumference of about 4.8 km (three miles). The slopes are covered with tree-savannah, housing teak (Tectona grandis), Wrightia tinctoria, Butea monosperma, and Helicteres isora, and with shrub-savannah housing Acacia nilotica and Ziziphus spp.. Along the lake shore, non-native Prosopis juliflora is spreading. Millet, maize, okra, banana, and papaya are the main cultivated crops. The water of the lake contains various salts and sodas. During dry weather, when evaporation reduces the water level, large quantities of soda are collected. Two small streams, named Purna and Penganga, drain into the lake, and a well of fresh water is located on the southern side, close to the water's edge. Geology ‚Äì Formation of the alluvium  Geological origin: Impact crater  Notification of the sanctuary View of the crater from space (image captured by NASA satellite) Satellite view of Lonar crater lake Lonar Lake lies within the only known extraterrestrial impact crater found within the great Deccan Traps, a huge basaltic formation in India.Pittarello, L., A. P. Crosta, C. Kazzuo-Vieira, C. Koeberl, and T. Kenkmann (2010) Geology and impact features of Vargeao Dome, southern Brazil. Meteoritics & Planetary Science. vol. 47, no. 1, pp. 51‚Äì71. The lake was initially believed to be of volcanic origin, but now it is recognized as an impact crater. Lonar Lake was created by the impact of either a comet or of an asteroid. The presence of plagioclase that has been either converted into maskelynite or contains planar deformation features has confirmed the impact origin of this crater. It is believed that only shock metamorphism caused by a hypervelocity impact can transform plagioclase into maskelynite, or create planar deformation features. The presence of impact deformation of basalt layers comprising the rim, of shocked breccia inside the crater, of shatter cones, and of the non-volcanic ejecta blanket surrounding the crater all support the impact origin of Lonar Lake. The crater has an oval shape. The meteorite impact came from the east, at an angle of 35 to 40 degrees. There are various estimates of the age of the crater. Earlier thermoluminescence analyses gave a result of 52,000 years, while recent argon- argon dating suggests that the crater is much older; it could be 570 000 ¬± 47 000 years old. This greater age is in line with the degree of erosion of the crater rim. As a result of the studies, the geological features of the Lonar crater have been divided into five distinguishable zones, exhibiting distinct geomorphic characteristics. The five zones are: # The outermost ejecta blanket # The crater rim # The slopes of the crater # The crater basin, excluding lake # The crater lake  History  The lake was first mentioned in ancient scriptures such as the Skanda Purana and the Padma Purana. The Ain-i-Akbari, a document written about 1600 CE, states: > These mountains produce all the requisites for making glass and soap. And > here are saltpetre works which yield a considerable revenue to the State, > from the duties collected. On these mountains is a spring of salt water, but > the water from the centre and the edges is perfectly fresh. The first European to visit the lake was a British officer, J.E. Alexander, in 1823. Buldhana district in Maharashtra, where the lake is located, was once part of the Maurya Empire empire and then part of the Satavahana Empire. The Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas also ruled this area. During the period of the Mughals, Yadavas, Nizam, and the British, trade prospered in this area. Several temples found on the periphery of the Lake are known as Yadava temples and also as Hemadpanti temples (named after Hemadri Ramgaya).  Ambar Lake  There is a small circular depression at a distance of around from the main lake, believed to be caused by a splinter of the meteor that hit the ground to also make a crater. There is a Hanuman temple near this lake, with the idol made of rock believed to be highly magnetic. The water from Ambar lake is being drained by local farmers. This lake is sometimes also called Chhota (little) Lonar.  By-products of the lake  The Gazetteer chronicles the findings of the British administrators and scientists, notably, Colonel Mackenzie, scientist Dr. I. B. Lyon, J. O. Malcolmson and Plymen, agricultural chemist. Some extracts from Plymen's report, given in quotes, are informative.Working of the Lake > The saline deposits obtained from the lake are rather of an exceptional > nature. Compared with the most famous salt lake in India, the Sambhar Lake > in Rajsthan (India), it will be seen that whereas at Lonar the carbonates of > soda are the most important, in the case of the Sambhar Lake the deposits of > sodium chloride or common salt give the lake its value. The modes of > formation are also entirely different and it is practically certain that the > Lonar salts are derived from an unknown source in the bed of the lake. It is > true that water is continually flowing into the lake and that except by > evaporation there is no loss. The main feeder stream could not however > supply this amount of alkali nor could the other smaller supplies coming in > during the rains, for on all sides of the lake vegetation is abundant, > particularly where the main stream flows in continuously. Were any quantity > of alkali present in this water, vegetation would suffer considerably and, > with exception of a few varieties of plants, eventually die out entirely. > The salts collected from this lake vary in their nature and composition and > from their-appearance are easily separated by men accustomed to handling > them. Various names are given to some five or six main varieties, but there > is no fixed line between one salt and another, their compositions depending > upon the period and condition of crystallization. At the present time large > quantities of these salts are lying on the shores of the lake... With the process of crystallization, sodium chloride or common salt is formed along with the carbonates of soda resulting in a number of products, as explained below. Kala Namak and Nimak Dalla are found in white crystalline masses. Khuppal is obtained in solid compact lumps and consists of a mixture of carbonates and chlorides in roughly equal proportions. Pipadi or Papri, which has a similar chemical composition, is very different in appearance. It is frequently tinged, slightly pink in colour and hollow air spaces are found between the crystalline masses which are formed in flakes or layers. Bhuski has no definite structure but consists of a soft flaky powder mixed with a quantity of impurity. It can be compared to small salt substance or baking soda. The salts are not all obtained in the same way or at the same period of the year. Pipadi and Bhuski are deposited on the shores of the lake as the water dries up in the hot weather, Pipadi being the upper layer and therefore the purer. Except for Bhuski the salts are in a fairly pure state and contain only small proportions of earthy matter. Their further purification is not considered difficult. Commercial exploitation of the salts from the lake is recorded from 1842, including the period of Government of Nizam, and until 1903. Presently, there is only a very small local demand for these Lonar Lake products.  Gaylussite mineral Gaylussite is the mineral has been recently reported from drill core in Lonar lake.Anoop et al., Palaeoenvironmental implications of evaporative gaylussite crystals from Lonar Lake, central India, Journal of Quaternary Science, V., Issue 4, pp. 349‚Äì359, May 2013 Gaylussite is a carbonate mineral, a hydrated sodium calcium carbonate, formula Na2Ca(CO3)2¬∑5H2O. It occurs as translucent, vitreous white to grey to yellow monoclinic prismatic crystals. It is an unstable mineral which dehydrates in dry air and decomposes in water. Streptomyces alkalithermotolerans is an alkaliphilic and thermotolerant bacterium species from the genus of Streptomyces which has been isolated from the Lonar soda lake in India.  Lake ecosystem  The chemical characteristics of the lake shows two distinct regions that do not mix ‚Äì an outer neutral (pH 7) and an inner alkaline (pH 11) each with its own flora and fauna. The lake is a haven for a wide range of plant and animal life. Resident and migratory birds such as black-winged stilts, brahminy ducks, grebes, shelducks (European migrants), shovellers, teals, herons, red-wattled lapwings, rollers or blue jays, baya weavers, parakeets, hoopoes, larks, tailorbirds, magpies, robins and swallows are found on the lake. Among reptiles, the monitor lizard is reported to be prominent. The lake is also home to thousands of peafowls, chinkara and gazelles. The area of was declared as Lonar Wildlife Sanctuary by the government on 20 November 2015.

Methylotrophic methanogenesis has been reported in Lonar Lake sediments and the primary microorganism (archaeon) that is responsible was identified as being closely related to Methanolobus oregonensis.Antony CP, Murrell JC, Shouche YS. (2012). Molecular diversity of methanogens and identification of Methanolobus sp. as active methylotrophic Archaea in Lonar crater lake sediments. FEMS Microbiol Ecol 81: 43‚Äì51. Endolithic microorganisms Endolithic bacteria belonging to the phyla Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria and Bacteroidetes, and endolithic archaea belonging to the phyla Thaumarchaeota and Euryarchaeota were detected in Lonar basalt rock samples that were retrieved from the crater walls and the lake-bed. The diversity and richness of endolithic bacteria in these samples were estimated to be higher than that of endolithic archaea. Most of the detected endolithic prokaryotes were identified as being putative methanotrophs, methanogens, phototrophs, ammonia-oxidizers, nitrogen-fixers, denitrifiers, dissimilatory sulfate-reducers and metal-reducers. Nitrogen- fixing microorganisms Nonsymbiotic nitrogen-fixing microorganisms such as Halomonas sp., Paracoccus sp., Klebsiella sp., Slackia sp., and Actinopolyspora sp. have been reported from this lake. All the nitrogen fixers are haloalkaliphilic in nature as they can grow only at pH-11. Some of the bacteria and actinomycetes isolated from this lake are able to grow on some components of inorganic medium containing martian soil simulant components.Avinash Anand Raut and Shyam S. Bajekal; Growth of Microaerophilic Nonsymbiotic nitrogen Fixing Microorganisms from Lonar Lake on Inorganic Medium containing Martian soil simulant components; in Journal of Pure and Applied Microbiology; to be published on October 2010. 2020 color change In early June 2020, the lake turned red/pink in a span of 2‚Äì3 days. Reports by Agharkar Research Institute, National Environmental Engineering Research Institute and Geological Survey of India suggested that lowered water levels and high salinity caused growth of Halobacterium and increased Carotenoid levels, which in turn led to color change.  Religious setting  Numerous temples surround the lake, most of which stand in ruins today, except for the temple of Daitya Sudan at the centre of the Lonar town, which was built in honour of Vishnu's victory over the giant Lonasur. It is a fine example of early Hindu architecture. Central Provinces Buldana district Gazetteer Vishnumandir, Wagh Mahadev, Mora Mahadev, Munglyacha Mandir and Goddess Kamalaja Devia are the other temples found inside the crater.  Daitya Sudan temple  Side profile of the Daitya Sudan temple Daitya Sudan Temple is a Vishnu temple dated to the Chalukya Dynasty which ruled Central and Southern India between the 6th and 12th centuries. It belongs to the Hemadpanthi class and is built in the form of an irregular star. It features carvings similar to those seen at Khajuraho temples. The deity of this temple is made of an ore with a high metal content that resembles stone. The ceiling of the temple has carvings. The exterior walls are also covered with carved figures. The plinth of the temple is about in height and the unfinished roof suggests an intended pyramidal form for the tower. The temple of Daitya Sudan at Lonar is the best example of the Hemadpanthi style. From the standing image of Surya in the principal niche on the back of the temple, it is conjectured that the temple was originally dedicated to the Sun god. However, in the present form its vaishnav temple of god vishnu in its daityasudan avatar. There is a story that a demon by the name of Lonasur or Lavanasur used to reside in this locality along with his sisters. He was killed by lord Vishnu in his Daityasudan Avatar hence the name. The temple measures . long by . broad. It is a tree chamber temple, the inner most being garbh gruh, the sanctum sanctorum, where the idol of lord vishnu standing atop Lavanasur is there. The present day idol was made by bholse rulers of Nagpur after the original went missing. The second chamber is called antarl where individual pooja are performed, on the roof of this block one can see beautiful cravings of puranic stories viz. Killing of Lavanasur by Lord Krishna and appearance of Dhar of Lonar; story of Kansa and Krishna, story of Narasimha and HiranKashyap and lastly raskrida. The outermost chamber is called as sabhamandap which is meant for group offerings and performance. This portion as well as the entrance gate does not match the style and construction elements of the temple overall. The brickwork might have been added later to the damaged or unfinished temple, which may be attributed to various invasions post the 10th century. The main entrance of the temple is east facing. The principle niche at the back of the temple has an image of Surya, the sun god, which gives rise to the speculation that this might have been dedicated to him. The niche on south has an image of Chamunda. The one on left of the temple i.e. north has Narasimha in it. All of these three niches are built like mini temples in themselves having elaborate pillars, base and decoration. There are numerous ridges onto the temple with different decoration, images having iconic as well as artistic significance. Many of the images depict deities or incidents on Hindu Puranas.  Other temples  * Kamalja Devi Temple is located beside the lake and also features carved images. Although the water level rises during the rainy season and falls in summer, the temple is located above the water level. * Gomukh Temple is located along the rim of the crater. A perennial stream emerges from here and pilgrims visiting the temple bathe in the stream. It is also called Sita Nahani temple and Dhara. * Shankar Ganesh temple, partially submerged and noted for rectangular shiva * Ram Gaya temple * Motha Maruti temple is near the Ambar crater lake, with the idol made of rock believed to be splinter of the meteor that created the crater.  Threats to Lonar lake  Lonar lake faces anthropological and environmental problems as listed below: * Use of fertilizers, pesticides and toxic materials in the agriculture field around the lake results in pollution of lake water. * \\"Dhara\\", and \\"Sita Nahani\\" are perennial streams that are one of the water sources for the lake. They are used for bathing, washing clothes and cattle, and other domestic purposes by the local people, pilgrims, and tourists. The household effluents containing detergents are regularly disposed of here. * Deforestation is illegally carried out in the surroundings and cattle grazing inside or near the rim of the crater creates fecal pollution. * Excavation activities are often carried out illegally thus disturbing the lake's underground water source. * The government is unable to raise funds needed for preserving this crater and often tourist activities continue to cause environmental damage to nearby land. * During local festivals such as the Kamala Devi festival, large numbers of pilgrims enter the crater. Small shops and food-stalls are often established near the crater or along its rim. * Among the frequent visitors are the religious visitors from nearby towns and villages who are not adequately educated by the means of signboards and attending officials about littering and maintaining the beauty of this nationally important destination. * The lake's ecosystem is being damaged because of the sewage dump in the lake. Marauding pilgrims and increasing pollution is disturbing its substantial flora and fauna with about 100 resident and migratory birds. * Commercial activities, including illegal construction, within the vicinity of lake has damaged the lake's natural topography. * According to a research done in 2017, the lead researcher stated \\"The study found out that reduction in water level is a combined result of drying up of (nearby) percolation dam and the closure of streams (which flow) into the lake.\\" The crater is protected as a geological landmark and authorities have recognized the role of the historical and archaeological heritage in the lake, nevertheless action is needed to prevent the adverse impact of settlements and religious festivities on the local ecosystem. Various civic activities (e.g. \\"Save Lonar\\") for the protection of Lonar crater are on-going.

HKScan Oyj () is a Finnish manufacturer of meat foods and products, but nowadays its product range also includes ready meals and pet foods. It is based in Turku. In the 1990s and 2000s the company ‚Äì by then known as HK Ruokatalo Oy ‚Äì targeted the international market, acquiring meat production companies around the Baltic Sea: In Sweden, Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania ‚Äì including the Swedish Scan AB in 2007, resulting in the modern-day name of the company. HK is originally an initialism of Helsingin Kauppiaat (\\"Helsinki Merchants\\"), a company that was acquired by LSO in 1991. HK is the best known brand of the company in its native Finland. Its Finnish subsidiary is still known as HK Ruokatalo Oy (\\"HK Food House Inc.\\"). HKScan Oyj is the fifth largest food manufacturer in Europe and a company listed in the Helsinki Stock Exchange. History :Text in this section is largely based on a translation of the company's history page The history of the company in its current form traces back to the year 1913, when a number of farmers founded the co-operative slaughterhouse of South-Western Finland (LSO ‚Äì Lounais-Suomen Osuusteurastamo, or nowadays LSO-Osuuskunta Oy, a subsidiary of HK Ruokatalo Oy responsible for attaining the livestock in Finland). The company was successful in domestic meat wholesales. More local co-operative meat producers joined LSO during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. A big reorganization took place in the Finnish meat products market in 1981 and 1985 when SOK and OTK ‚Äì both large retailing co- operatives ‚Äì gave up their own meat industries. This naturally led to major increase in LSO's market share. During the early 1990s LSO acquired other domestic food manufacturers: Helsingin Kauppiaat Oy in 1991 and Kariniemi Oy in 1993. Helsingin Kauppiaat was a meat producer with a factory located in Helsinki's suburb S√∂rn√§inen at the time. Its products included the well- recognized Sininen Lenkki sausage. Kariniemi was a producer of chicken meat. S√∂rn√§inen area is still active (as of 2010) in meat production and wholesale business, spotting Helsingin Tukku wholesaler and Chef Wotkin's meathouse, but all the functions of the original HK factory, including the production of Sininen Lenkki, have moved to a new factory in Pakkala, Vantaa. The company started foreign expansion in 1998, when it bought the majority of shares in the Estonian Rakvere Lihakombinaat, a previously state-owned but later privatized food producer. More companies were acquired in the following years: Soko≈Ç√≥w in Poland, Tallegg in Estonia and Rigas Miesnieks in Latvia. Rigas Miesnieks has operations in Lithuania as well, where the company offers Klaipedos Maistas brand products in addition to its own Latvian brands. In 2006 and 2007 the heavily expanded company, that by this time was known as HK Ruokatalo Group, acquired Scan AB, the largest meat producer in Sweden. Consequently, the company renamed to HKScan Oyj. In September 2010 HKScan announced that it would acquire the biggest poultry products manufacturer in Denmark, Rose Poultry. The company has optimized its production chain heavily during the 1990s and 2000s, leading to many mass layoffs and closures. Production facilities in Turku were closed in October 2007, and in Tampere in March 2008. Brands In Finland, HK Ruokatalo Oy offers several brands including: * HK: all beef and pork meat and products, ready meals and salads. The most-recognized product is probably Sininen Lenkki ‚Äì an inexpensive mixed- meat sausage. * Kariniemen: Chicken products. * Popsi: Knackwursts, some sausages. * Via: The latest addition, gourmet products designed by the TV chef Jyrki Sukula, including dressings.

Radio Paris evolved from the first private radio station in France, called Radiola, founded by pioneering French engineer √âmile Girardeau in 1922. It became Radio Paris on March 29, 1924, and remained so through June 17, 1940, transitioning to state ownership in December 1933 as the premier station in the country. It kept its name from July 1940 until August 1944, but the station was then run by Nazis and French collaborators. From 1940, collaborationist voices on Radio Paris included Jacques Doriot and Philippe Henriot. From 1942, Jean H√©rold-Paquis broadcast daily news reports on Radio Paris, in which he regularly called for the \\"destruction\\" of the United Kingdom. His catch phrase was \\"England, like Carthage, shall be destroyed!\\", echoing Cato the Elder's slogan Carthago delenda est. On September 19, 1941, Maurice Chevalier sang in Le Poste Parisien his last success, \\"Notre Espoir\\", composed by his accompanist Henri Betti. Radio Paris broadcasts were intended to counter the BBC broadcasts of Radio Londres by Free French figures like Pierre Dac, who sang the taunting refrain, Radio Paris ment, Radio Paris ment, Radio Paris est allemand (\\"Radio Paris lies, Radio Paris lies, Radio Paris is German\\"), to the tune of \\"La Cucaracha\\". On 8 May 1942 its transmitter in Bourges was blown up by the Resistance.

Designed at the end of World War I, it was a pioneering weapon with many modern features.  Design  The vehicle was designed by colonel , deputy chief executive officer of the compagnie des forges et aci√©ries de la marine (Saint-Chamond). The 194 mm gun was a derivative of the 155 mm GPF and was designed at Atelier de Construction de Puteaux by Louis Filloux. A prototype was manufactured with a 155 mm gun but a weapon of 194 mm calibre was eventually chosen since tracked self- propelled guns were heavy and expensive vehicles and only the more powerful guns were to be used. Saint-Chamond also designed the Mortier 280 mm TR de Schneider sur aff√ªt-chenilles St Chamond. Both SPGs used the same two tracked vehicles, avant-train (lead vehicle) and affut-chenille (gun chassis). The lead vehicle carried ammunition and a Panhard SUK4 M2 electrical generator. Both vehicles were powered by two electric motors, energy being sent to the affut by a flexible electric cable. The gun barrel was displaced at the rear of the chassis when the vehicle had to move. Compared to a contemporary British vehicle, the Gun Carrier Mark I which was a tracked vehicle upon which a field gun was sat, the Canon de 194 was much more advanced; it was driven by only one person, had hydraulic brakes and the gun had automatically adjusting recoil mechanisms and pneumatic recuperators.  Service  Production began in April 1918. Two days before the armistice, the vehicle, without its Puteaux gun, was tested at Saint-Chamont plant. By June 1919, Saint-Chamond was still waiting for the delivery of the oscillating mass, a key component manufactured by Puteaux. During the interwar, they served in an artillery regiment in Valence, alongside the 280 mm SPGs. 36 were still in service at the outbreak of World War II and some were captured by the invading German forces. Surviving vehicles were pressed into Wehrmacht service as the 19.4 cm Kanone 485 (f) auf Selbstfahrlafette. At least three of them were used by the Germans in Russia in about 1942.

From there it meandered north and then back south, joining the current channel at a point about 1350 yds (1.2 km) from the Mandale in a roughly west-northwest direction. These two meanders, along with the tidal nature of the river and the presence of shifting sandbars, made navigation difficult. The journey from Stockton to Middlesbrough could take as long as the journey from Middlesbrough to London. Stockton's flour industry required good river navigation to compete with other ports. Removing the meanders was seen as a means of preventing the town's decline as a port. The Mandale Cut The Company dug a channel at the Mandale to cut off the southern meander and opened this improvement in 1810. Although it was a comparatively simple engineering work, political problems had dogged the operation since it was first suggested in the 1790s. In particular, property owned by Lord Harewood lay on the southern meander and would lose all access to the river after the cut was made. Lord Harewood was eventually compensated and the work went ahead. The Portrack Cut Cutting off the northern meander required a longer channel to be dug, the final cut being 1,100 yds (1 km) long. Since the northern meander was shorter and the cut longer, the net reduction in distance was less, but the bypassing of islands and sandbars in the Portrack meander still made it worthwhile. The work was completed in 1831, resulting in the present river channel. The Tees Conservancy Despite these two improvements, the River's usefulness continued to deteriorate. The estuary below Cargo Fleet was treacherous, as the river divided into three channels around various bars and shoals. In the 1850s another Act of Parliament replaced the Tees Navigation Company with the Tees Conservancy Board which took charge of the entire navigation of the river. Much of the work carried out by this body exploited the growing iron industry in Middlesbrough. Large amounts of slag from the processing of iron ore were dumped along the channel in order to narrow and straighten it, causing the river to flow faster and thus scour its own bed. In addition, there was much work done dredging channels for ships.

Two classes of neurotrophic factor receptors are the p75 and the \\"Trk\\" families of Tyrosine kinases receptors. * p75 is a low affinity neurotrophin receptor, to which all neurotrophins bind. It is a member of the tumour necrosis super family. In some contexts, the phrase \\"x\\" only applies to this receptor. * The Trk family include TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC, and will only bind with specific neurotrophins, but with a much higher affinity. The Trks mediate the functional signals of the neurotrophins. * NGF binds to TrkA, BDNF and NT-4 bind to TrkB and NT-3 binds to TrkC. In addition NT-3 also binds to and activates TrkA and TrkB but it does so less efficiently. * Whilst the Trk receptors have a clearly defined trophic role, p75 receptors activate signalling pathways which can also result in apoptosis. TrkA, B, and C receptors TrkA mediates its actions by causing the addition of phosphate molecules on certain tyrosines in the cell, activating cellular signaling. There are other related Trk receptors (TrkB and TrkC), and there are other neurotrophic factors structurally related to NGF (BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4) * TrkA mediates the effects of NGF * TrkB binds and is activated by BDNF, NT-4, and NT-3 * TrkC binds and is activated only by NT-3 LNGFR receptor The other NGF receptor, the LNGFR, (for Low affinity nerve growth factor receptor, commonly known as \\"p75\\", plays a less clear role. LNGFR binds and serves as a \\"sink\\" for neurotrophins. Cells which express both the LNGFR and the Trk receptors might therefore have a greater activity - since they have a higher \\"microconcentration\\" of the neurotrophin. However, although NGF has been classically described as promoting neuron survival and differentiation, research performed in the early 2000s suggest that NGF with its prodomain attached (proNGF) can elicit apoptosis of cells that are positive for the LNGFR and negative for TrkA. Secreted proNGF has been demonstrated in a variety of neuronal and non-neuronal cell populations. It has been proposed that secreted proNGF can elicit neuron death in a variety of neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, following the observation of an increase of proNGF in the nucleus basalis of postmortem Alzheimer's brains.

His doctoral dissertation was on the topic of Classical Maya personal names, rulership titles and glyphs,Entitled: \\"\\" (in English, Sense and meaning of Classic Maya personal names: a typological analysis of anthroponymic phrases in the hieroglyphic inscriptions of the Classic Maya culture, as a contribution to general onomastic studies). under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Nikolai Grube.Professor Grube was to describe Colas as \\"...\\" (one of the most important young Maya researchers). Quote as reproduced in Seiler (2008). This was the first major survey and analysis on the subject, and was published in book form by German academic publishers Verlag Anton Saurwein.Issued as volume 15 in the monographic series of titles in Mesoamerican studies, Acta Mesoamericana. Colas successfully defended his dissertation and was awarded a PhD in Anthropology the same year, in 2004.Sachse (2008) Career and research While a doctoral student at Bonn, Colas was awarded two stipendary grants from the Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes (the national academic foundation of Germany) to support his research.Institut f√ºr Altamerikanistik und Ethnologie (2008) After obtaining his PhD Colas was awarded a research scholarship from the DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, the largest research funding body in Europe), under its prestigious Emmy-Noether- Programme.See Institut f√ºr Altamerikanistik und Ethnologie (2008), Sachse (2008). The scholarship programme is named for the early 20th century German mathematician, Emmy Noether. In 2005 and 2006 Colas undertook fieldwork among the Yukatek-speaking Maya communities in and around San Antonio in Cayo District, Belize. This project, registered with the DFG as \\"\\", involved ethnographic and sociolinguistic research among contemporary Maya communities, and continued on after he relocated to Nashville in 2006 to accept a position as assistant professor in anthropology at Vanderbilt University. While at Vanderbilt the focus of his ethnographic study of the Maya in Belize was an investigation of \\"the effects of globalization and Christian fundamentalism on the acquisition of the Yucatec Maya language in Belize\\". Death On the evening of August 26, 2008, professor Colas was fatally shot at his home in East Nashville. His younger sister Marie Christine Colas who was visiting from Switzerland was also critically wounded in the same incident; she died later in hospital from her injuries. Nashville police reported they had arrested and then charged four suspects with homicide in relation to the shooting, three males and one female. A fifth suspect was being sought. Police advised that robbery appeared as the likely motive at that stage in the investigations, and although two of the suspects lived a couple of blocks away they were otherwise unknown to Colas. By early 2013, the murderer and several of his accomplices had been convicted to lifetime imprisonment.

It is the oldest home located in the Pomona Valley and in the old Rancho San Jose land grant. It was declared a historic landmark in 1954 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in April 1975. History The Rancho San Jose was created out of land seized from the Mission San Gabriel Arc√°ngel in 1834 as part of the Mexican government's decree of secularization. In 1837, Mexican Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado granted the land to Ygnacio Palomares and Ricardo Vejar. The Rancho, covering to and much of eastern Los Angeles County, was operated by Palomares and Vejar as a sheep and cattle ranch. After receiving the land grant, Palomares built his initial adobe homestead in 1837 on land that is now part of Pomona. The simple five-room adobe, which is known as the Casa Primera, was the first home in the Pomona Valley and was built in the Mexican adobe style with thick walls made of adobe brick. Palomares and his family lived at the Casa Primera for approximately seventeen years. Between 1850 and 1855, Palomares built a much larger adobe home for himself, known as the Ygnacio Palomares Adobe. In 1867, Palomares' son, Francisco Palomares, moved into the Casa Primera with his wife, Lujardo Alvarado. Francisco discovered an artesian well on the grounds of the adobe, the first such well discovered in the Pomona Valley. The well provided an ample supply of water, allowing Francisco to plant the area with orange trees, some of which were still thriving in the 1970s. Taking advantage of the area's water resources, Francisco and his partners also formed the Old Settlement Water Company in 1874. Portions of an old stone-lined canal built by the water company can still be seen in the area. Francisco Palomares lived in the Casa Primera until he died in 1882. After Francisco's death, the Casa Primera was purchased by Dr. Benjamin S. Nichols, who also acquired the nearby La Casa Alvarado. Nichols, who had moved to Pomona from New York, became the President of the Pomona Land and Water Company. In 1947, Roscoe Hart purchased the property and remained the owner until 1972. In 1972, Hart sold the Casa Primera at a public auction. He told the Los Angeles Times that \\"the work of keeping it up became too much.\\" At that time, the home consisted of four bedrooms, two baths, a dining room, three fireplaces and a pool on . Hoping to preserve the Casa Primera, the Historical Society of Pomona Valley raised funds to purchase the property for a price up to $80,000. When the bidding went above $80,000, the auctioneer halted the bidding for two minutes to allow Historical Society representatives to confer. The Historical Society ultimately placed the winning bid, purchasing the home for $85,000. Another bidder said afterward she had been prepared to go to $100,000 but agreed not to raise the bid on learning she was bidding against the Historical Society. After acquiring the Casa Primera, the Historical Society restored it with period furniture and opened it to the public as a historic museum. Since 1973, it has been a frequent location for traditional Mexican and Spanish folklorico celebrations, including Spanish shawl displays, music and dancing. In 1987, a celebration was held at the Casa Primera celebrating the 150th anniversary of the signing of the Rancho San Jose land grant. The celebration included Mexican dancers, strolling musicians, a parade of the descendants of early Mexican families, and a staged wedding ceremony with the principals and guests dressed in period costume.. Historic designation The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The building is operated as a museum by the Historical Society of Pomona Valley.

It is the ultimate escalation in international relations conflicts, and follows explicit diplomatic threat to use force as a means of coercion. In general a military threat is identified when military personnel are detected conducting operations that can be interpreted as a phase that precedes combat, i.e. occupying positions, preparing weapons for use, and concentrating forces in an offensive manner. It may be more appropriate to think in terms of indicators. The DoD Dictionary defines indicator as: 1. In intelligence usage, an item of information which reflects the intention or capability of an adversary to adopt or reject a course of action. (JP 2-0) 2.

The same storyline was reused and expanded on later in the year on TV in Space Battleship Yamato II, albeit with a more upbeat ending. Plot The Yamato and her crew face the onslaught of the Comet Empire, a civilization from the Andromeda Galaxy that seeks to conquer Earth, led by Zwordar the Great (Prince Zordar in the English dub). The Earth ship is aided by an antimatter woman, Teresa of Telezart (known as Trelaina in the English dub), while the Comet Empire has revived Earth's greatest enemy, the Gamilas' leader Desslar, who is eager for revenge. After an immense battle destroys the forces of both Earth and the Comet Empire, the Yamato destroys the White Comet's cover, revealing the Empire City that hid inside it. After a long battle, Susumu Kodai orders the handful of survivors off the Yamato before ramming her into the Emperor's ship head-on, sacrificing his life and the ship to defeat Zwordar and save humanity.

In English-speaking countries, it was known by the title Space Cruiser.  Plot  In the distant future, the war between the human race and the aliens known as the Gamilons has destroyed the Earth. Radioactive asteroids have devastated the planet making its atmosphere uninhabitable. In an effort to assist the Earth, Queen Starsha of the planet Iscandar offers the Earth Forces a device that can completely neutralize the radiation. In order to get this device, the space battleship Yamato is launched from the remains of its World War II ancestor on a 148,000 light-year journey. The crew of the Space Battleship Yamato has only one Earth year to travel to Iscandar and back, or the human race will become extinct.

Cut by Flume Brook, the gorge features walls of Conway granite that rise to a height of and are apart. Discovered in 1808 by 93-year-old \\"Aunt\\" Jess Guernsey, the Flume is now a paid attraction that allows visitors to walk through it from May 10th to October 20th. Pets are not allowed.  Geology  Nearly 200 million years ago in the Jurassic period, the Conway granite that forms the walls of the Flume was deeply buried molten rock. As it cooled, the granite was broken by closely spaced vertical fractures that lay nearly parallel in a northeasterly direction. Sometime after the fractures were formed, small dikes of basalt were forced up along the fractures. The basalt came from deep within the earth as a fluid material, and because of pressure, was able to force the Conway granite aside. The basalt crystallized quickly against the relatively cold granite. Because of this quick cooling, the basalt is a fine-grained rock. Had this material ever reached the surface, it would have become lava flows. Erosion gradually lowered the earth's surface and exposed the dikes. As the overlying rock was worn away, pressure was relieved and horizontal cracks developed, allowing water to get into the rock layers. The basalt dikes eroded faster than the surrounding Conway granite, creating a deepening valley where the gorge is now. The gorge was covered by glaciers during the Ice Age, but the ice sheet did not greatly change the surface. It partially filled the valley with glacial debris and removed soil and weathered rock from the vicinity. After the Ice Age, Flume Brook began to flow through the valley again. The highly fractured granite and basalt have been eroded by frost action and by the brook's water. As one walks through the Flume Gorge, at the floor one may notice remnants of the main basalt dike, and that small trees are growing on the walls of the gorge. Erosion is still occurring.  Discovery  Part of Avalanche Falls at the head of the Flume Gorge The Flume was discovered in 1808 by 93-year-old \\"Aunt\\" Jess Guernsey when she accidentally came upon it while fishing. She had trouble convincing her family of the marvelous discovery, but eventually persuaded others to come and see for themselves. At that time, a huge, egg-shaped boulder hung suspended between the walls. The rock was high and long. A heavy rainstorm in June 1883 started a landslide that swept the boulder from its place. The boulder has never been found. The same storm deepened the gorge and formed Avalanche Falls.

Formed in October 1939, it was the first 2nd AIF unit raised from the state of South Australia during the war; after completing a period of training in Australia, the battalion embarked for overseas service. Initially, it had been intended that the 2/10th and its parent brigade ‚Äì the 18th Brigade ‚Äì would be sent to the Middle East to join the other brigades of the 6th Division, but instead the 18th Brigade was sent to strengthen the garrison in the United Kingdom after France capitulated in mid-1940. Re-assigned to the 9th Division, the 2/10th remained in the United Kingdom undertaking defensive duties until late 1940 when it finally arrived in the Middle East, where the 18th Brigade became part of the 7th Division. The battalion's first experience of combat came during an attack against the Italian garrison at Giarabub in March 1941. This was followed by defensive actions during the Siege of Tobruk later in the year before the 2/10th joined the Allied garrison in Syria, which had previously been captured from the Vichy French. In early 1942, following Japan's entry into the war, the 2/10th was withdrawn to Australia and in August 1942, at the height of the Japanese advance in the Pacific, the battalion was committed to the fighting around Milne Bay in the Territory of Papua, suffering heavy casualties in their debut in the Pacific. Further fighting came during the Battle of Buna‚ÄìGona in northern Papua before the 2/10th was brought back to Australia for re-organisation in March 1943. In August 1943, it was sent to the Territory of New Guinea, first undertaking jungle training near Port Moresby and then, in December 1943, moving inland into the Finisterre Mountains where they later fought the Battle of Shaggy Ridge. After being withdrawn to Australia in mid-1944, the battalion did not take part in further fighting until the final months of the war when they were committed to the fighting on Balikpapan in July 1945. Following the conclusion of hostilities, the 2/10th Battalion was disbanded in December 1945. History Formation and training in Australia The 2/10th Battalion was established at the Wayville Showgrounds, in Adelaide, on 13 October 1939, as part of the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), which was raised in Australia shortly after the outbreak of the war for overseas service. Organised into four rifle companies, designated 'A' through to 'D', and a headquarters company,Allchin 1958, p. 39. the 2/10th was the first 2nd AIF unit raised from the state of South Australia during the war, and was colloquially known as \\"The Adelaide Rifles\\".Allchin 1958, cover. The colours chosen for the battalion's unit colour patch (UCP) were the same as those of the 10th Battalion, a unit which had served during World War I before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921. These colours were purple over light blue, in a horizontal rectangular shape, although a border of gray was added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart and the original World War I battalion.Long 1952, pp. 321‚Äì323. Along with the 2/9th, 2/11th and 2/12th Battalions, the 2/10th was subordinate to the 18th Brigade, which was recruited from the less populous states of Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania,McKenzie-Smith 2018, p. 2291. and was initially allocated to the 6th Division, the first of the 2nd AIF's four infantry divisions. The battalion's first commanding officer was Lieutenant- Colonel Arthur Verrier, a World War I veteran who had previously commanded the 43rd Battalion.Pratten 2009, p. 320. He assumed command on 13 October 1939.Allchin 1958, p. 1. After the battalion's recruits had concentrated at Wayville, the 2/10th moved to Woodside Camp, in the Adelaide Hills to city's east in early November, where they carried out initial training.Allchin 1958, pp. 4‚Äì12. In mid-December, they moved by train to New South Wales on the east coast of Australia where the battalion joined the other units of the 18th Brigade, and further training was completed at Greta Camp and then Ingleburn.Allchin 1958, pp. 15‚Äì20. In early May 1940, the battalion was ready to deploy overseas, and embarked on the transport ship , which departed Sydney on 5 May 1940, bound for the Middle East.Allchin 1958, pp. 40‚Äì41. Garrison duties in the United Kingdom Troops of the 2/10th Battalion training during June 1940 On 10 May 1940, after the 2/10th had departed Australia, the Germans launched a lightning assault across France and the Low Countries, which rapidly led to the capitulation of France and the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force. As a result of Italy's entry into the war, coupled with concerns about a possible invasion of the United Kingdom, the Australian government decided to divert some of its troops from the Middle East. As a consequence, as the 18th Brigade was sailing towards the Middle East it was redirected to the United Kingdom. On 18 June 1940, the Mauretania docked at the port of Gourock, in Scotland. The brigade was subsequently re-allocated to the 9th Division and the Australians were transported to the south of England, eventually establishing themselves around Lopcombe Corner, on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire. While there, a number of the battalion's personnel married local girls.Allchin 1958, p. 80. Amidst the backdrop of the Battle of Britain, while stationed on Salisbury Plain the battalion carried out garrison duties and undertook training to enable them to rapidly respond in the event that an invasion took place. They received a large amount of new equipment during this time to improve their mobility, including new Universal carriers, weapons and lightweight personal load-carrying equipment.Allchin 1958, p. 72. They also experienced German air attacks for the first time, and on 8 July 1940, the battalion incurred its first casualty when one of its members was wounded in an air raid. In early October, the 2/10th undertook a large-scale exercise near Tidworth, and then in the middle of the month as winter set in, they were moved to Essex, where they replaced the tents they had been living in with the stone buildings and Nissen huts of Hyderabad Barracks, in Colchester.Allchin 1958, p. 87. The battalion's stay there was short-lived, though, for the following month, after the threat of invasion had passed, the order arrived for the Australians to embark for the Middle East.Johnston 2005, pp. 4‚Äì6. The 2/10th subsequently entrained at Colchester in mid-November and moved north to Scotland where, on 17 November, they boarded the .Allchin 1958, p. 95. alt=Australian soldiers sitting amongst desert rubble Fighting in the Middle East Sailing via South Africa, shore leave was taken in Durban, which was reached on 12 December. The convoy remained there until late December when it continued on to Egypt via the Red Sea due to the threat of attack that was present in the Mediterranean; the battalion reached Port Tewfik just before the new year.Allchin 1958, pp. 101‚Äì103. The 18th Brigade was again re-assigned in February 1941, this time to the 7th Division, with whom they would see out the remainder of the war; at the same time, the brigade was converted from a four-battalion structure to three, and the 2/11th was transferred to help form the 19th Brigade.Johnston 2005, pp. 2‚Äì3. On 21 March 1941, the battalion undertook its first action of the war, when one of its companies ‚Äì 'D' Company ‚Äì supported the 2/9th Battalion in their attack on the Italian held fort at Giarabub. Meanwhile, the remainder of the battalion began preparations for deployment to Greece where an invasion was expected. These plans were interrupted when the 7th Division was committed to the fighting in North Africa in response to German gains in Cyrenaica. At this time, the 18th Brigade was sent to garrison the vital port of Tobruk as the 9th Division withdrew from Cyrenaica.McKenzie-Smith 2018, pp. 2291‚Äì2292. It was at Tobruk that the battalion fought its first major action as a complete unit in April 1941, when it undertook defensive actions during the Siege of Tobruk. During the Battle of the Salient, fought in early May, the 2/10th took over a position on the northern flank of the perimeter, relieving the 2/48th Battalion, coming under heavy air attack during the handover.Wilmot 1993, pp. 142 & 146. After the initial German and Italian assault, on the evening of 3/4 May the 18th Brigade counter-attacked to retake positions lost; the 2/10th was given a supporting role, tasked with carrying out raids deep into the opposing forces' territory while the 2/9th and 2/12th Battalions attacked the northern and south-eastern flanks of the salient. In the fighting that followed, the 2/10th's casualties were six missing and fifteen wounded, but they inflicted heavy casualties upon their enemy before withdrawing back to the \\"Blue Line\\",Wilmot 1993, pp. 149‚Äì151. about behind the main defensive line where the counter-attacking reserve forces were positioned to respond to a deep penetration.Wilmot 1993, p. 86. After the fighting in early May, the 2/10th was withdrawn to Pilastrino for a brief respite and placed in reserve,Maughan 1966, p. 236. but by the middle of May, they had returned to the salient, and on 16 May advanced the line over .Wilmot 1993, pp. 184‚Äì185. The 2/10th carried out further raids in \\"no man's land\\" as the siege continued,Wilmot 1993, p. 227. but in August the battalion was withdrawn to Palestine for training. In September 1941, the 2/10th were sent to Syria where they were assigned to the Allied garrison that had occupied the country following the conclusion of the Syria‚ÄìLebanon campaign and the defeat of the Vichy French forces there. The garrison was deployed in order to defend against a possible German attack from the Caucasus towards the strategically important Middle Eastern oilfields. During this time, the 2/10th Battalion was stationed near Aleppo, where the battalion manned outposts near the Syrian‚ÄìTurkish border across a frontage that was several hundred miles long.Allchin 1958, p. 224.Johnston 2005, p. 71. New Guinea campaigns The 2/10th remained in Syria until January 1942 when, after having endured a freezing cold winter that included snow,Allchin 1958, p. 227. it was transported back to Palestine in preparation for a return to Australia. Following Japan's entry into the war the previous December, and in light of Allied reverses in the Pacific, the Australian government had requested the return of some of its forces in order to bolster the defence of Australia due to concerns about a possible invasion.Keogh 1965, p. 85. The 2/10th subsequently embarked on the Dutch passenger ship ,Allchin 1958, p. 230. bound for Australia in early February 1942. Stopping over in Bombay, the battalion was transferred to the transport Nevassa on which they continued the journey to Adelaide where they arrived in late March.Allchin 1958, pp. 231‚Äì234. A period of re-organisation and training followed around Kilcoy in Queensland.Allchin 1958, p. 237. Following Japanese landings on the north coast of New Guinea in July, Australian forces in the area became involved in a series desperate defensive actions, as they were pushed inexorably back towards Port Moresby. By early August 1942, the situation for the Australians was critical,Keogh 1965, pp. 183‚Äì185. and at this time the battalion was committed to the New Guinea campaign.Allchin 1958, p. 241. alt=Australian and US soldiers planning operations amidst a jungle setting On 5 August, the 2/10th embarked on the Dutch transport Both,Allchin 1958, p. 243. departing from Brisbane.McKenzie-Smith 2018, p. 2292. A week later, on 12 August, the 2/10th, along with the other two infantry battalions of the 18th Brigade, landed at Milne Bay, in the Territory of Papua where they reinforced the Militia units from the 7th Brigade who were defending the area. A fortnight later the Japanese landed a force at Milne Bay in an attempt to secure the airfields that the Australians had built there.Keogh 1965, pp. 186‚Äì191. In the ensuing Battle of Milne Bay, the Australians eventually won a significant victory. After the initial landing was held by the 61st Battalion, the 2/10th relieved them before taking part in heavy fighting around a mission station known as the KB Mission. The 2/10th suffered heavily, losing 43 killed and 26 wounded,Allchin 1958, p. 263. and after passing through the lines held by the 25th Brigade, was placed in reserve around No. 3 Strip. One of the battalion's companies ‚Äì 'C' Company ‚Äì was detached to Normanby Island in September, where they captured several Japanese soldiers who had become isolated there. In October, the 2/10th was flown to Wanigela, near the north Papuan coast, where they were tasked with carrying out patrols and defending the beach against a possible Japanese landing, and helping to construct an airfield. The battalion's next major action came in late December 1942 during the Battle of Buna‚ÄìGona, after being transported by sea to the beachhead front, landing just south of Cape Endaiadere.Allchin 1958, p. 282. Heavily engaged around the disused Buna airstrip where the Japanese had constructed several bunkers,Allchin 1958, p. 283. in a fortnight of fighting the battalion suffered over 300 casualties, including 112 killed. Another attack was made around Sanananda in mid-January 1943, before the 2/10th was withdrawn from the fighting, flying to Port Moresby in February. On 10 March, the battalion embarked upon the transport Willis Van Devander to return to Australia, landing in Cairns on 12 March.Allchin 1958, pp. 338‚Äì339. After establishing itself around Ravenshoe, Queensland, the next three months was a period of flux for the battalion, with many men taking leave or being discharged due to tropical diseases or injuries from the previous campaign. The battalion was brought up to strength with a large draft of volunteers from the 11th Motor Regiment, a motorised Militia light horse unit consisting largely of Queenslanders and New South Welshmen.Allchin 1958, pp. 339‚Äì340. A period of rest and re-organisation followed during which the units of the 2nd AIF were converted to the Jungle Division establishment.Johnston 2005, p. 165. After this, large-scale divisional manoeuvres took place in mid-July, after which the battalion received orders to sail for overseas again. Embarking upon the transport Canberra from Townsville, they arrived in Port Moresby in early August.Allchin 1958, p. 341. After a period in which the 18th Brigade was held back in reserve at Port Moresby to defend the approaches to Lae,Bradley 2004, p. 179. in December 1943 the 2/10th was sent into the Finisterre Mountains, where they joined the rest of the 7th Division whose campaign through the Markham and Ramu Valleys had culminated in heavy fighting around Shaggy Ridge during the first months of 1944.Keogh 1965, p. 352. During this period, several British Army officers were attached to the battalion as observers, arriving from Burma.Allchin 1958, p. 346. The Battle of Shaggy Ridge proved to be the most significant action for the 2/10th during the fighting in Ramu Valley. The battalion commenced its advance from Cam's Saddle on 20 January, with one company forward, and another in support. Amidst heavy rain that turned the ground to thick mud and flooded the Faria River, over the course of several days, they undertook several attacks around the ridges, and patrols along the river to link up with the neighbouring 2/12th Battalion. The battalion then pushed a company forward at a time against the last Japanese resistance around the 4,100 feature, which was strongly fortified with barbed wire and defended with machine guns. Heavy artillery, mortars and air support helped reduce the Japanese position, which was eventually secured by 1 February.Allchin 1958, pp. 346‚Äì348. The battalion's losses during this period amounted to 16 men killed in action, or died of wounds, and 27 wounded.Allchin 1958, p. 348. After Shaggy Ridge was taken the battalion advanced to the Kankiryo Saddle, where the 18th Brigade was relieved by the 15th Brigade. The 2/10th was moved into reserve along with the rest of the 18th Brigade around the Mene River,McKenzie-Smith 2018, p. 2293. and in early May 1944 it were flown to Lae and withdrawn to Australia, being transported home on the Duntroon.Allchin 1958, p. 352. Borneo and disbandment alt=Infantrymen advance alongside tanks After disembarking in Townsville on 8 May 1944, a period of leave followed, after which the battalion reconstituted in July 1944 and went into camp at Samsonvale, near Brisbane. In August, they took part in a march through Brisbane, before travelling north to Cairns in September, from where they moved to Kairi, near Tolga.Allchin 1958, p. 353‚Äì356. A large number of reinforcements arrived at this time, as the battalion was severely undermanned due to transfers or discharges from injuries or illnesses, and a new commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Daly, was appointed.Allchin 1958, pp. 353 & 356. After this, the 2/10th began a long period of training. As a result of indecision about the employment of Australian troops in the latter part of the war, they spent over a year waiting for their final campaign. This came in the final months of the war when they were committed to the fighting on Borneo. Staging out of Morotai Island, early on the morning of 1 July 1945 they came ashore at Klandasan as part of Operation Oboe Two, which was launched to recapture Balikpapan.Allchin 1958, p. 371. After landing they fought to wrest control of the high ground to the west of the beachhead ‚Äì dubbed \\"Parramatta Ridge\\" by the Australians.Allchin 1958, p. 373. During the fighting for Parramatta Ridge, the battalion pressed home its attack despite having no reserves left, and lacking direct fire support after the supporting tanks became bogged.Long 1963, p. 519. In the days the followed, the battalion's attention turned to fighting around the town of Balikpapan itself and its port. On 6 July, they were withdrawn from the fighting, and placed in brigade reserve; the fighting for Parramatta Ridge cost the 2/10th fifteen killed and 41 wounded;Allchin 1958, pp. 385‚Äì386. several of these were caused when supporting US aircraft accidentally attacked the battalion's lines around Hill 87. Although the battalion undertook a series of local patrols after this, the fighting around Parramatta Ridge constituted the 2/10th's last major action of the war. After the hostilities ended in mid-August following Japan's surrender, the battalion's personnel were slowly repatriated back to Australia in drafts for demobilisation and discharge. Others chose to remain in the Army including a group of about 70 personnel were transferred to other units for subsequent service in the 34th Brigade, which had been formed to undertake occupation duties in Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force.Allchin 1958, pp. 389‚Äì390. The battalion's last commanding officer, Daly, would remain in the service, eventually becoming Chief of the General Staff in 1966‚Äì1971. The battalion was finally disbanded on 29 December 1945 while still at Balikpapan; upon disbandment there were only 42 members of the battalion left for the 2/10th's final parade. During this ceremony, the battalion flag was entrusted to the Militia 10th Battalion,Allchin 1958, p. 294. which had served briefly in a garrison role in Australia during the war and which was subsequently re-raised in South Australia after the war.Rayner 1995, pp. 352 & 360.Festberg 1972, p. 69. Throughout the course of the war, a total of 3,008 men served with the 2/10th BattalionJohnston 2005, p. 248. of whom 315 were killed or died on active service, and 525 wounded. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: two Distinguished Service Orders, one Member of the Order of the British Empire, seven Military Crosses, six Distinguished Conduct Medals, 14 Military Medals and 51 Mentions in Despatches. Battle honours The 2/10th was awarded the following battle honours: * North Africa, Defence of Tobruk, The Salient 1941, South-West Pacific 1942‚Äì1945, Buna‚ÄìGona, Cape Endaiadere‚ÄìSinemi Creek, Sanananda‚ÄìCape Killerton, Milne Bay, and Liberation of Australian New Guinea.

Those who practice colon cleansing believe in autointoxication, that accumulations of putrefied feces line the walls of the large intestine and that these accumulations harbor parasites or pathogenic gut flora, causing nonspecific symptoms and general ill-health. Autointoxication, a term coined in 1884 by the French physician Charles Jacques Bouchard, is a hypothesis based on medical beliefs of the Ancient Egyptians and Greeks and was discredited in the early 20th century. Nonetheless, during the 2000s Internet marketing and infomercials of oral supplements supposedly for colon cleansing increased. There is no scientific evidence for the alleged benefits of colon cleansing. Certain enema preparations have been associated with heart attacks and electrolyte imbalances, and improperly prepared or used equipment can cause infection or damage to the bowel. Frequent colon cleansing can lead to dependence on enemas to defecate and some herbs may reduce the effectiveness of, or increase the risks associated with the use of prescription medications.  Effectiveness and risks  The symptoms that are attributed to autointoxication‚Äîheadache, fatigue, loss of appetite and irritability‚Äîmay be caused by mechanical distention within the bowel, such as irritable bowel syndrome, rather than toxins from putrefying food. The benefits anecdotally attributed to colon cleansing are vague and the claims made by manufacturers and practitioners are based on a flawed understanding of the body. There is little evidence of actual benefit to the procedure, and no evidence that it can alleviate the symptoms that are attributed to the theories of colon cleansing. As the colon normally expels waste, colon cleansing is generally unneeded. Colonic irrigation can disrupt the bowel's normal flora, and, if done frequently, can result in electrolyte depletion with dehydration. Rare but severe adverse events have been rectal perforation, as well as amoebic infection, from poorly sterilised equipment. Others claim that colon cleansing may impede the colon's shedding of dead cells. Excessive use of enemas has also been associated with heart problems, such as heart failure, as well as heart attacks related to electrolyte imbalances when performed as a coffee enema. Frequent enemas or other colon-cleansing tools may lead to dependence and inability to defecate without assistance, as well as potential withdrawal symptoms. Herbs taken orally may modulate the absorption or the activity of prescription medications. Medical doctor Harriet Hall writes that \\"The colon cleanses itself... The idea that its walls are coated with years- old hamburger residue is preposterous\\". Colon hydrotherapy Colonic irrigation also known as colon hydrotherapy, colonic hydrotherapy, or a \\"colonic\\", is a treatment which is used \\"to wash out the contents of the large bowel by means of copious enemas using water or other medication.\\" During a cleansing enema, liquid is introduced into the colon and retained for five to fifteen minutes. During a colonic, liquid is introduced into the colon and then it is flushed out and this is repeated until the entire colon is cleared. Colonic irrigation has been described as an \\"unwise\\" procedure as it carries the risk of serious harm and has no proven benefit.  Supplement effectiveness  The consumer advocacy news program Marketplace conducted a consumer trial with three women on the effectiveness of two colon supplements versus fiber. The results showed the supplements did not assist in weight loss and provided no additional benefit over a basic fiber supplement. According to the American Cancer Society, \\"Available scientific evidence does not support claims that colon therapy is effective in treating cancer or any other disease\\".  History  The concept of autointoxication, the idea that food enters the intestine and rots, provides a rationale for colon cleansing. The ancient Egyptians believed that toxins formed as a result of decomposition within the intestines, and moved from there into the circulatory system, causing fever and the development of pus. The Ancient Greeks adopted and expanded the idea, applying their belief in the four humours. In the 19th century, studies in biochemistry and microbiology seemed to support the autointoxication hypothesis, and mainstream physicians promoted the idea. Daly notes that, historically, \\"purging was one of the few procedures that a physician could perform with visible, often impressive results and without immediate or obvious dangers\\". Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov (1845-1916) became the strongest supporter of the idea of colon cleansing; he thought that toxins could shorten the lifespan. Over time, the concept broadened to autointoxication, which supposes that the body cannot fully dispose of its waste products and toxins, which then accumulate in the intestine. In some cases, the concept led to radical surgeries to remove the colon for unrelated symptoms. Autointoxication enjoyed some favor in the medical community in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but clinicians discarded it as advances in science failed to support its claims. A 1919 paper entitled \\"Origin of the so- called auto-intoxication symptom\\" in the Journal of the American Medical Association marked the beginning of the rejection of the auto-intoxication hypothesis by the medical community. Despite a lack of scientific support, autointoxication persists in the public imagination. In the 1990s the practice of colon cleansing experienced a resurgence in the alternative-medical community, supported by testimonials and anecdotal evidence and promoted by manufacturers of colon-cleansing products.  Regulation  In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the production of equipment used in colon hydrotherapy but does not regulate their use, or the supplements used in oral colon-cleansing regimens. Manufacturer claims do not require verification or supporting evidence. The contents of the products are also not verified or tested. The FDA has issued several letters warning manufacturers and suppliers of colon hydrotherapy equipment about making false claims of effectiveness, safety issues, and quality control violations.

It ran south from the Pacific- Farallon-Kula triple junction at 51¬∞N to the Pacific-Farallon-Antarctic triple junction at 43¬∞S.The Solid Earth As the Farallon Plate subducted obliquely under the North American Plate, the Pacific-Farallon Ridge approached and eventually made contact with the North American Plate about 30 million years ago. On average, this ridge had an equatorial spreading rate of 13.5 cm per year until its eventual collision with the North American Plate. In present day, the Pacific-Farallon Ridge no longer formally exists since the Farallon Plate has been broken up or subducted beneath the North American Plate, and the ridge has segmented, having been mostly subducted as well. The most notable remnant of the Pacific-Farallon Ridge is the 4000 km Pacific-Nazca segment of the East Pacific Rise. Characteristics As a spreading ridge, the Pacific-Farallon Ridge was a divergent plate boundary, which is where the two plates are moving away from each other. Partial mantle melting occurs beneath such ridges, which forms new oceanic crust. The Pacific-Farallon Ridge was thought to be a particularly productive spreading ridge, and there are estimates that the ridge and its remnants have formed up to 45% of all oceanic lithosphere since 83 million years ago. The spreading rate of the Pacific- Farallon Ridge has varied throughout its lifetime with an acceleration of its spreading rate occurring 55 to 48 million years ago, around the same time that a significant portion of the Farallon Plate broke to form the Vancouver Plate. The spreading rate decreased once the ridge made contact with the North American Plate 16 million years ago. Formation of the Juan de Fuca (including Explorer and Gorda) and Cocos plates (including Rivera) and of the San Andreas Fault from the Farallon plate Geologic history As the Farallon Plate made contact with the North American Plate and began subducting beneath it, it fragmented into the Juan de Fuca Plate and Cocos Plate, and then later fragmented further to form the Rivera Plate. Once the Pacific-Farallon Ridge began subducting beneath the North American Plate, the remains of the Farallon Plate broke apart to form the Monterey, Arguello, Magdalena, and Guadelupe Microplates, and the southern portion of the ridge rotated in a clockwise manner. The contact of the ridge with North America marked a transition of the Pacific-Farallon Ridge from being a globally oriented spreading ridge system to a locally oriented one. The distinction between these systems is that slab pull and gravitational gliding forces determine the characteristics of the globally oriented whereas those of the locally oriented are influenced by the contact of the ridge with the North American Plate. As the Pacific-Farallon Ridge began its subduction underneath the North American plate 30 million years ago, its southern segment, the East Pacific Rise continued spreading. The East Pacific Rise did not begin its subduction under the North American Plate until 20 million years ago, and the presently surviving portion of the East Pacific Rise is the Pacific-Nazca segment. The present-day spreading from the East Pacific Rise dominates the spreading regime in the Central and South Pacific.

Peter Tessem and Paul Knutsen were two young men from Norway who went with fellow Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen on his 1918 Arctic expedition aboard ship Maud. Peter Tessem was a carpenter and Paul Knutsen was an able- bodied seaman. One year into the expedition, in 1919, Amundsen left Peter Tessem and Paul Knutsen behind at Cape Chelyuskin after having made winter quarters there. Amundsen chose Peter Tessem because he had been suffering from chronic headaches throughout the winter and was not fit to continue the long expedition. He selected Paul Knutsen because he had previously wintered in the Kara Sea in 1914-1915 with Otto Sverdrup on ship Eclipse, so he knew about the locations of the caches of provisions that had been left in the area by Sverdrup. The men were instructed to wait for the freeze-up of the Kara Sea and then sledge southwestwards along the western coast of the Taymyr Peninsula towards Dikson, carrying the mail and the valuable scientific data accumulated by the expedition. Meanwhile, the Maud continued eastwards into the Laptev Sea.William Barr, The Last Journey of Peter Tessem and Paul Knutsen, 1919. These two men disappeared mysteriously during their 800-km trip over the ice and were never seen again. The Norwegians' journey was identical in its last 600 km to the sledge trip undertaken a few years earlier at the orders of Baron Eduard Toll by Zarya Captain Nikolai Kolomeitsev and Cossack Stepan Rastorguyev. In 1901, Kolomeitsev and Rastorguev had covered the distance from Bukhta Kolin Archera, SW of Taymyr Island, to Dikson in one month, so Tessem and Knutsen's trip should not have taken much longer. However, almost a year passed and nothing was heard of the two Norwegians.William Barr, The Last Journey of Peter Tessem and Paul Knutsen, 1919. Norwegian search expedition The alarm was raised in March 1920 by Amundsen's brother Leon when he got a telegram from his brother. Roald Amundsen, who was then wintering near Ayon Island, in the East Siberian Sea, was enquiring whether his men had reached home safely.William Barr, The Last Journey of Peter Tessem and Paul Knutsen, 1919. Veteran Arctic explorer Otto Sverdrup, acting on behalf of the Royal Norwegian Department for Churches and Education, tried to conduct a search by sending schooner Heimen to the Kara Sea on 23 August 1920. However, the schooner encountered heavy ice already east of Dikson, and Captain Lars Jakobsen was forced to turn back when he was close to the Mikhailov Peninsula. Jakobsen tried then to hire dogs or reindeer for an overland expedition, but the practical difficulties he encountered became unsurmountable, for the area was practically uninhabited except for the little station at Dikson.William Barr, The Last Journey of Peter Tessem and Paul Knutsen, 1919. Soviet search expedition Finally, in 1921, Nikifor Begichev led a Soviet expedition in search for Peter Tessem and Paul Knutsen on request of the government of Norway. Captain Lars Jakobsen and Alfred Karlsen, another Norwegian who had been with him at Dikson and who acted as interpreter, accompanied Begichev. Begichev had a good impression of Jakobsen and Karlsen; he thought that they were tough, reliable and helpful.William Barr, The Last Journey of Peter Tessem and Paul Knutsen, 1919. At the start of their search, they had a letter dated November 18, 1919, found about a tenth of the way from Cape Chelyuskin to Dikson; it was placed in a tin can in a cairn on Mys Vil‚Äôda (Cape Vilda). It said that Tessem and Knutsen were heading towards Dikson in good health with provisions for twenty days.William Barr, The Last Journey of Peter Tessem and Paul Knutsen, 1919. On August 2, 1919, some distance south- west of Cape Vilda, the Norwegian sledge was found by Jakobsen indicating that something had gone wrong with the two men. Further, he found other materials near Cape Sterligov. On August 16, 1919, Begichev found a fireplace with smoked men's bones near Cape Primetny, including a skull, empty cartridges, and a broken knife, suggesting a physical struggle.William Barr, The Last Journey of Peter Tessem and Paul Knutsen, 1919. After examination of the things, Begichev decided that the bones belonged to one of the missing Norwegian seamen. However, after Begichev's death, it was presumed that the bones belonged to somebody from Rusanov's expedition.William Barr, The Last Journey of Peter Tessem and Paul Knutsen, 1919. The expedition of 1922 found a theodolite, mail, and other things on the Zeledeev river, 80 km from Dikson, belonging to Knudsen and Tessem. Closer to Dikson, on the Uboynaya River, two pairs of Norwegian skis and part of a sleeping-bag were found. Finally, in July 1922, three kilometers from Dikson, Begichev found a skeleton of the man wearing a golden watch engraved with Peter Tessem's name.William Barr, The Last Journey of Peter Tessem and Paul Knutsen, 1919. The search was abandoned, but before Captain Jakobsen and Alfred Karlsen returned to Norway via Krasnoyarsk, they had established good friendships with many Russians. Owing to their good character, the Soviet authorities and many persons in different places of Russia went out of their way to assist them. This was not always easy considering the penury of the times in the early Soviet Union.William Barr, The Last Journey of Peter Tessem and Paul Knutsen, 1919. Remains found by chance In August 1922, a geological expedition led by N. N. Urvantsev found, by chance, the mail and scientific data that Tessem and Knutsen had been carrying. The valuable documents lay strewn about, abandoned near the mouth of the Zeledeyeva River. Later, the skis belonging to the missing Norwegians were found at the mouth of the Uboynaya River. In July 1922, a mummified corpse, practically a skeleton, was found on the mainland shore across from Dikson Island within sight of the weather station that was the two men's destination. Forensic analysis revealed that it was one of the two Norwegian explorers and that the most likely cause of death was starvation. Another possible cause of death is that the Norwegian hurried when he saw the lights of the polar station, so that he slipped and fell down. He might have knocked himself unconscious hitting a boulder, could not stand up, and froze to death.Great Arctic State Nature Reserve - Scientific activity It is not clear, however, whether the corpse by the shore was Peter Tessem's or Paul Knutsen's; the golden watch with Tessem's name engraved on it led to the presumption that it was Tessem. The photo of the skeleton was taken by Georgy Rybin.Photo of Tessem's skeleton by Georgy Rubin The other body was never found. The dead man was buried farther up the slope in the same spot and his grave was marked with a driftwood cross. Two years later, the crew of Norwegian ship Veslekari erected a more imposing larch cross on the spot. In 1958, the remains were moved to the top of the cape where there is now a granite monument with a plaque inscribed in Russian, and in the Roman alphabet, to honor the memory of the dead Norwegian. The inscription reads: TESSEM, Norwegian seaman, member of the expedition, MS Maud, died 1920. References *William Barr, The Last Journey of Peter Tessem and Paul Knutsen, 1919.

It won recognition as one of five novels shortlisted in the first The Man Asian Literary Prize in 2007.  Summary  The novel starts in a cloudy August night when a casket bearing the corpse of one who is identified as Aurora V. Cabahug arrives in the Ninoy Aquino International Airport from Jeddah. Mysteriously identified by Jeddah authorities as having died from drowning, she is one of 700 Filipino overseas workers who return as corpses to NAIA every year.Soledad's Sister by Jose Y. Dalisay. Anvil Publishing. . The corpse, however, is not the real Aurora Cabahug but of her older sister, Soledad. The real Aurora Cabahug, called Rory, has in fact never set foot beyond the small town of Paez and is a singer in the Flame Tree, a KTV nightclub frequented by cops, the town‚Äôs vice-mayor and Koreans. Rory learns of her sister's death and she claims the body with the help of a local police officer, Walter G. Zamora. Along the way, their vehicle along with the casket is stolen by notorious carnapper known as Boy Alambre. In the end, Soledad's casket, is discovered by Boy Alambre. He pushes the casket into a murky river, but in an ironic twist of fate, the thief is taken along and drowns with the corpse. Soledad remains as faceless as she was when she came home.

He made a number of unsubstantiated claims and sought to get $20,000 from the government, which was never paid. He returned to Pennsylvania and worked as a lawyer. Early life Samuel Adams was born in Beaver, Pennsylvania on October 20, 1828. His mother was Cynthia Darragh, whose great grandfather was John Hart, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. His father was Dr. Milo Adams (1790‚Äì1846). Adams descended from Captain Benjamin Adams, an officer in the American Revolutionary War. He studied at the old academy at Beaver, Pennsylvania. He studied law and became a member of the bar in Pennsylvania in 1853. He practiced for many years in Des Moines, Iowa. Colorado River survey In 1864, Adams was head of a Colorado River freighting company, Union Line. He sought to send freight along the Colorado River by steamship, but his business did not become viable. From 1864 to 1869, Adams surveyed the Colorado River and its tributaries. He produced a report, which he delivered to the War Department in 1869 and requested reimbursement of expenses of $20,000. Adams claimed that during the exploration, he found a place he called \\"Paradise Valley\\" that had fields of grain seven feet high; that he had found gold, copper, lead, and silver; and that the Colorado River was freely navigable for 600 miles from its mouth. During the same period, John Wesley Powell conducted a more extensive survey. When asked about Adams' report, Powell found many of the statements to be inaccurate, including a claim that Adams first surveyed an area that was surveyed in 1857 by Joseph C. Ives. Adams struggled for over ten years to impose his view of the Colorado River - that it was a mineral paradise shot through with veins of gold and silver - but ultimately failed. In 1878, Senator Francis Cockrell rejected a resolution that would have compensated Adams for his spontaneous work. Adams' survey, while wildly off the mark and generally recognized as unscientific, was a notable moment in the exploration of the West. In the words of Powell biographer Wallace Stegner, it was a \\"symptom. In his resistance to fact and logic he had many allies who were neither so foolish in their folly nor so witless in their rascality as he, but whose justification and platform was the same incorrigible insistence upon a West that did not exist.\\" Route to Pacific Ocean In 1869, he told residents of Breckenridge, Colorado that he believed he had found a route from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean via the Colorado River. He was able to arrange for boats to be built and a team of eleven to take the trip with him. They set off on the Blue River, a tributary of the Colorado River, but were unsuccessful in reaching the Colorado. The boats broke apart and the men left Adams. Later years At the end of his life he resettled in his hometown where he practiced law. He died on May 15, 1915 in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, as the oldest member of the Pennsylvania bar.

It is endemic to high-altitude subalpine and alpine regions in Tasmania, Australia. The prominent white flower spikes appear over summer, followed by small bright red or yellow fruit in late summer and autumn. Described by Robert Brown in 1810, it is the sole member of the genus Bellendena, which is in turn the sole member of subfamily Bellendenoideae, and is thought to represent an early offshoot within the family. Taxonomy Scottish botanist Robert Brown described the mountain rocket in 1810 as Bellendena montana, naming the genus in honour of John Bellenden Ker Gawler for his botanical works. The species name is the Latin adjective montanus and refers to its montane habitat. Its common name refers to its red-tipped rocket-shaped flowerheads. Phylogenetic studies often place this genus as basal (one of the earliest offshoots) to the rest of the Proteaceae, though its exact position and relationships are unclear. A 2006 analysis, sythesesizing of molecular and other studies, by Weston and Barker located it as sister to the subfamily Persoonioideae, the two sharing a common ancestor which diverged from the other Proteaceae. However, the genus has an anatomical feature, laterocytic stomata (having 3 or more parallel specialised subsidiary cells), which it shares with the Platanaceae (next closest relatives to the Proteaceae) and no other Proteaceae, which indicate it diverged from all other members of the family first. Description Bellendena montana grows as a low, spreading multistemmed shrub to anywhere from 10 cm to 1.8 m high, and 1 m in diameter. The leaves are thick and variable, ranging from oblanceolate to spathulate to wedge-shaped (cuneate) in shape with recurved margins and measuring 1‚Äì6 cm long and 0.2 to 2.2 cm wide. Plants from north-eastern Tasmania have narrower leaves than elsewhere, and populations from higher altitudes have smaller leaves and more crowded foliage. The flowers occur in terminal racemes which are held on short stems above the foliage. These are followed by small egg- shaped (obovate) bright red or yellow fruit, which are ripe in late summer and autumn. Distribution and habitat Bellendena montana is found at altitudes above 1000 m (3500 ft), though rarely lower to 400 m. It grows on low-nutrient soils (mostly dolerite, but sometimes quartzite or basalt-derived) with good drainage, often rocky outcrops, as well as more boggy areas and alpine heathland. Cultivation The plant has attractive flowers, fruit and foliage, but is not often cultivated because it is difficult to grow at low altitudes. Propagation by seed or cutting is unreliable.

T. Barnum. In 1861, Nutt was touring New England with a circus when Barnum hired him to appear at the American Museum in New York City. Barnum gave Nutt the stage name Commodore Nutt, a wardrobe that included naval uniforms, and a miniature carriage in the shape of an English walnut. Nutt became one of the Museum's major attractions. Nutt was in love with Lavinia Warren, another dwarf at the American Museum. Lavinia was several years older than Nutt. She thought of him only as a \\"nice little boy\\". She married General Tom Thumb in a spectacular wedding masterminded by Barnum in 1863. Nutt went to the wedding as Thumb's best man, but resented his place in the show. He stayed away from women for a long time after the wedding. In 1879, he married Lilian Elston of Redwood City, California. Nutt toured the world between 1869 and 1872 with the Thumbs and Minnie Warren, Lavinia's sister. They returned to America rich beyond their dreams after appearing before royalty around the world. Nutt left Barnum's employ after a disagreement with the showman. He toured with a comic opera company, put together a variety show on the United States West Coast, and operated western saloons in Oregon and California. He returned to New York City, and died there of Bright's disease in May 1881. Birth and family George Washington Morrison Nutt was born in Manchester, New Hampshire, to Major Rodnia Nutt (1810‚Äì1875), and his wife Maria (Dodge) Nutt (1807‚Äì1859) of Goffstown, New Hampshire. Rodnia was a rich farmer, a Manchester city marshal, and a Manchester city councilman. The Nutts had five children. The first, whose name and sex are not known, was born on 8 December 1837. James Dodge was born on 28 January 1838, and Rodnia, Jr. on 11 October 1840. A daughter, Mary Ann, was born on 22 September 1844. According to Nutt family records, George Washington Morrison was born on 1 April 1848. Nutt and his wife were \\"large, hearty folk\\". Mr. Nutt weighed over . Their sons Rodnia, Jr. and George Washington Morrison were dwarfs. In 1861, Rodnia, Jr. was about tall, and George was about . George weighed about . Ancestry George's ancestors include William Nutt (1698‚Äì1751), a weaver of English ancestry. William left Derry, Ireland for North America in the early 18th century. He started a family in colonial New England. A part of Manchester was called Nutfield in the early days of colonization. A pond and a road near the pond were named for early Nutt colonists. P. T. Barnum and the American Museum Barnum and Nutt, c. 1862 Nutt's career as an entertainer may have started in 1854. He may have been a performer with a small circus in Manchester. The circus manager, William C. Walker, once wrote that he discovered Nutt. He also wrote that he was the first to show him. Nutt was being exhibited and touring the New England countryside with a manager named Lillie when P. T. Barnum learned of him. Lillie was charging as little as a nickel to see the boy whose education had been neglected. Barnum was disgusted. Lillie knew nothing about exhibiting the boy \\"in the proper style\\", as Barnum put it. Barnum met Nutt in 1861 when the boy went to the American Museum in New York City. In his autobiography, Barnum wrote that Nutt was \\"a most remarkable dwarf, who was a sharp, intelligent little fellow, with a deal of drollery and wit. He had a splendid head, was perfectly formed, and was very attractive, and, in short, for a 'showman' was a perfect treasure.\\" Barnum knew Nutt could be a major museum attraction. He hired a lawyer to lure Nutt away from his manager. Following Barnum's orders, the lawyer offered Nutt's parents a large sum of money to sign their son to a five-year contract. He promised them that the boy would be taught to be \\"a genteel, accomplished attractive little man\\". A contract was signed on 12 December 1861. Barnum hired the 13-year-old, 29-inch George and his 21-year-old, 49-inch brother, Rodnia, Jr. The contract required Barnum to give both young men food, clothing, a place to live, and the costs of travel and medical care. Barnum promised to take care of the moral and academic education of the brothers. Salaries would start at US$12 per week with increases every year. The two brothers would each get $30 per week in the fifth and last year of their contract. They would also get 10% from the sales of their souvenir books and photographs, with at least $240 the first year and $440 the last year. At the end of the fifth year, they would receive a carriage and a pair of ponies from Barnum. Publicity campaign Sheet music cover for \\"The Commodore Nutt Polka\\" by Thomas Baker, c. 1862 Once the contract was signed, Barnum started a publicity campaign to prepare the public for Nutt's debut. He let reporters think he was trying to hire the dwarf. When other showmen heard this rumor, they rushed in to offer Nutt's parents huge sums of money to be the first to sign their son. Barnum was pleased. The publicity created much excitement. In a letter he leaked to reporters, he wrote that he was forced to outbid the competition. The showman claimed to have paid $30,000 to hire the dwarf. The boy then became known as \\"The $30,000 Nutt\\". Barnum gave the dwarf the stage name Commodore Nutt. In addition, he provided Nutt with a wardrobe that included miniature naval uniforms. For the Commodore's jaunts about town, the showman had a little carriage built for him. This carriage looked like an English walnut. The top of the vehicle was hinged. When the top was lifted, the little Commodore could be seen sitting inside. Nutt's carriage was pulled by Shetland ponies. It was driven around New York by Rodnia, Jr. dressed in the uniform of a coachman. Barnum thought these little trips about town the best form of advertisement. Nutt's carriage is now in the Barnum Museum in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Debut Publicity material for Nutt, c. 1862 Commodore Nutt made his debut at Barnum's American Museum in February 1862. He was a great success. Some museum-goers believed they were being \\"humbugged\\" by Barnum though. They thought that Nutt was really General Tom Thumb in disguise. Nutt did look like the Tom Thumb of the past, but Thumb had aged and put on weight over the yearsa fact museum-goers either forgot or ignored. Nutt was a scamp; he took pleasure in the public's confusion, and encouraged the error. When Nutt debuted, Thumb was touring the American South and West. Barnum wanted to silence those with doubts at the Museum. He asked Thumb to cut his tour short, return to New York, and perform on the same stage with Nutt. Thumb returned to New York. The little men were billed as \\"The Two Dromios\\"A reference to characters in Shakespeare's The Comedy of Errors who are twins. and \\"The Two Smallest Men, and Greatest Curiosities Living.\\" The exhibit opened on 11 August 1862. Despite what their eyes witnessed, some museum-goers still said that Nutt was Tom Thumb in disguise. Barnum wrote, \\"It is very amusing to see how people will sometimes deceive themselves by being too incredulous.\\" About two months after his debut, Nutt met with New York City Police Department officers. He applied for and was given a policeman's job. He ordered a uniform. Then he sent a telegram to the officers of the Ninth Precinct telling them that he had just gotten a job on the Broadway Squadwith \\"extraordinary powers to arrest\\" people outside the Museum and to \\"take [them] upstairs\\". President Lincoln President Abraham Lincoln asked Barnum and Nutt to come to the White House in November 1862. When the two arrived, Lincoln left a cabinet meeting to welcome them. Nutt asked Salmon P. Chase, the Secretary of the Treasury, if he was the man who was spending so much of Uncle Sam's money. Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War, interrupted to say that he was the man. \\"Well,\\" said Nutt, \\"It is in a good cause, anyhow, and I guess it will come out all right.\\" As Barnum and Nutt were on their way out, President Lincoln shook Nutt's hand. He told the Commodore that he should \\"wade ashore\\" if his \\"fleet\\" was ever in danger. Nutt looked up and down Lincoln's long legs. \\"I guess, Mr. President\\", he said, \\"You could do that better than I could.\\" Personal life Lavinia Warren Lavinia Warren, 1862 Mercy Lavinia Warren Bump was a dwarf who taught school in her hometown of Middleborough, Massachusetts. She was traveling on a showboat-museum in the Midwest however when Barnum learned of her. He hired her in 1862. Her name was shortened to Lavinia Warren. She first appeared at the Museum in 1863. Warren was 21 years old, tall, and weighed . Barnum billed her as \\"The Queen of Beauty\\". Nutt developed an \\"adolescent crush\\" on her, but would be disappointed. Barnum gave Lavinia a diamond and emerald ring. It did not fit her finger properly, so he told her to give the ring to Nutt as a token of her friendship. Nutt regarded the ring as a token of her love instead. He fell more in love with her than ever. Lavinia was uncomfortable with his attentions. She thought of herself as \\"quite a woman\\", but regarded Nutt as just a \\"nice little boy\\". Thumb was not appearing in New York City when Lavinia was hired, but he met her when he visited the Museum in the autumn of 1862. He told Barnum the same day that he had fallen in love with her. Thumb wanted Barnum on his side in this love affair (rather than on Nutt's side), so he quietly promised Barnum he would marry Lavinia in a public ceremony. Barnum knew at once that such a spectacle would make him a fortune. He told Lavinia to take Thumb's romantic interest seriously. He reminded her that the little man was rich. Thumb's rival Nutt knew that Thumb was in love with Lavinia. He was jealous. He had a fight with Thumb in a dressing room at the Museum. He threw him on the floor, and beat him up. Nutt invited himself along when Lavinia was asked to Barnum's home for a weekend visit. Little did he know that Thumb and his mother would be there, too. Nutt left New York City on a train late Saturday night. He got to Barnum's house about 11 pm. He found Thumb and Lavinia alone in the downstairs parlor. Thumb had proposed, and Lavinia had accepted. Nutt only learned of their engagement a week later when Lavinia and Barnum told him. Nutt had a hard time forgiving both Thumb and Barnum for (as he termed it) this \\"dastardly\\" offense. Preparations Lavinia's younger sister Minnie was much smaller than she was. Barnum thought she would make a good match for Nutt. He asked Nutt to think about marrying Minnie. Nutt told Barnum he had little faith in women. He said that he would not marry \\"the best woman living\\". Barnum wanted Minnie and Nutt to go to the wedding as Lavinia and Thumb's bridesmaid and best man. Nutt refused. Later, Thumb himself asked Nutt to be his best man. Nutt accepted. He told Barnum, \\"It was not your business to ask me. When the proper person invited me, I consented.\\" Barnum's \\"Fairy Wedding\\" The \\"Fairy Wedding\\" by Mathew Brady Thumb and Lavinia were married at Grace Episcopal Church, New York City, on Tuesday 10 February 1863. Nutt and Minnie were best man and bridesmaid at the \\"Fairy Wedding\\". Police stopped traffic as people gathered in the streets to see the arrival of the wedding party. The wedding was scheduled to start at noon, but the bride did not arrive until 12:30 pm. Barnum led the wedding party down the center aisle. Two thousand people were invited to the wedding. Mrs. John Jacob Astor, Mrs. William H. Vanderbilt, Mrs. Horace Greeley, and General Ambrose Burnside were there. Members of the church complained about the \\"marriage of mountebanks\\". They became irate when they were told they could not sit in their own pews. Much of the public curiosity about the marriage was based on an interest in the sexual mechanics of Thumb and Lavinia. Barnum did not encourage or discourage this interest. The wedding reception was held in the Metropolitan Hotel on Broadway at 3 pm. The four little members of the wedding party stood on top of a grand piano so they could be seen by everyone. Nutt gave Lavinia a diamond ring as a wedding present. Americans loved the wedding. It was welcome relief from the horrors and sorrows of the war. World tour and aftermath Playbill for Jack the Giant Killer People around the world took great interest in the wedding. Barnum thought this was a chance to make a lot of money. He sent the members of the wedding party on long, successful tours of America and Europe. The four dwarfs were sent off again this time on a grand tour of the world as The Tom Thumb Company. The four little people left the United States on 21 June 1869. They travelled 60,000 miles around the world, visited 587 cities and towns, and gave 1,471 performances of songs, speeches, and military drills. They returned to America in 1872. Nutt and Barnum argued after the tour. Nutt quit. He joined Harry Deakin's Lilliputian Comic Opera Company. This company toured America in an operetta called Jack, the Giant Killer. Nutt and his brother Rodnia put together a variety show. It played in Portland, Oregon. It was not a success. Nutt went to San Francisco, California, and put together another show. He tired of the life within a year and quit. Another show he put together about this time was not successful either. Nutt ran a couple of saloons in Oregon and San Francisco, but these were not successes.  Last years  Commodore Nutt as Ajax defying the thunder, 1864 Nutt with Minnie Warren in 1863 Newspapers reported at least four times that Nutt and Minnie were married. They were close friends, but never husband and wife. Minnie married a song and dance man who performed on roller skates named Edmund Newell. She died while having their baby in 1878. One day long after the wedding of the Thumbs, Barnum asked Nutt why he had not married. \\"Sir, my fruit is plucked\\", he said, \\"I have concluded not to marry until I'm thirty.\\" His bride's height was of no concern, he said, but he did \\"prefer marrying a good, green country girl to anyone else.\\" In 1879, Nutt married Miss Lilian Elston of Redwood City, California. He had met her while he was touring the American West. She was a bit shorter than most women, but not a dwarf. After his failures on the West Coast, Nutt went back to New York City. He bought a saloon. One day, he was caught selling liquor without a license. The New York City courts closed his saloon. Nutt was in charge of an amusement area called Rockaway Pier for a time. He returned to performing with an act called \\"Tally- Ho\\".  Death  Early in 1881, Nutt had an attack of Bright's disease (nephritis). He was sick for more than two months. He died on 25 May 1881 at the Anthony House in New York City. Nutt's wife cried over his coffin at the funeral. She called him her \\"dear little boy\\", and said that he was \\"so good\\". Nutt was buried in Merrill Cemetery at Manchester, New Hampshire. His grave is unmarked. It is thought that he was buried in a spot either next to or possibly between his parents, or between the siblings that were also interred in the family plot. Nutt had grown from his original to , and weighed a little less than at his death. In 1891, the editors of Appleton's Cyclopedia wrote, \\"Commodore Nutt was distinguished for large-hearted virtues that are often lacking in bigger men; his genial temper was allied to constancy and generosity that entitle his memory to the highest respect.\\" The editors noted that Nutt was \\"for many years faithful to an early love.\\"  Notes  References    * External links * The Lost Museum Entertainers with dwarfism 1848 births 1881 deaths People from Manchester, New Hampshire American circus performers ","title":"Commodore Nutt"},{"id":"19140148","text":"Laurence Urdang (March 21, 1927 ‚Äì August 21, 2008) was a lexicographer, editor and author noted for first computerising the unabridged Random House Dictionary of the English Language, published in 1966.

Upper nobility  In the course of the 11-15th centuries, only people who held specific high offices in the royal administration or in the Royal Households were distinguished by law within the nobility, but from the 16th century, families whose ancestors had been authorized by the monarchs to use a distinctive noble title (e.g., baron, count) formed a hereditary social class. Its first members descended from the leaders of the Magyar tribes and clans and from the western knights who immigrated to the Kingdom of Hungary in the course of the 10-12th centuries. They were the \\"men distinguished by birth and dignity\\" (maiores natu et dignitate) mentioned frequently in the charters of the first kings. From the 1210s, the dignitaries of the central administration and the Royal Households were referred to as \\"barons of the realm\\" (barones regni) in official documents but their legal status was exclusively linked to the office they held and their offspring could not inherit it. The Cetin Castle (in Croatia) - a fortress owned by the Counts Frankopans from the 14th century In 1193, King B√©la III granted Modru≈° County in Croatia to Bartolomej, the ancestor of the Frankopans (Frangep√°n) family; thenceforward, he and his descendants used the hereditary title count but no specific privileges were connected to it. Quite to the contrary, the theory of the \\"one and same liberty\\" (una eademque libertas) of the nobles strengthened and finally, it became enacted in 1351. From 1397, the descendants of the \\"barons of the realm\\" were referred to as \\"barons' sons\\" (filii baronum) or magnates (magnates) in official documents and from the 1430s, they received the honorific magnificus, an expression that had earlier been used only when addressing the \\"barons of the realm\\". Munk√°cs Castle (today Mukachevo in Ukraine) - the seat of Prince Fyodor Koriatovych at the turn of the 14-15th centuries Besides the Counts Frankopan, the members of foreign ruling houses and the nobles of foreign origin who held offices in the royal administration or owned estates in the Kingdom of Hungary (e.g., Duke Ladislaus of Opole, Prince Fyodor Koriatovych, the Despot Stefan Lazareviƒá and Count Hermann II of Celje) were the first individuals who used noble titles, but in theory, their legal status was still equal to that of the poorest members of the lesser nobility. Similarly, the status of the brothers Szentgy√∂rgyi did not change when they were rewarded with the hereditary title count of the Roman Empire in 1459 by Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor who had been claiming the throne for himself against King Matthias I. Hunyadi Castle in Temesv√°r (today Timi»ôoara in Romania), built in the 15th century King Matthias I also rewarded his partisans with hereditary titles when he appointed them to hereditary heads of counties (h√¶reditarius supremus comes) and authorized them to use red sealing wax (similarly to the counts of the Roman Empire). In 1487, a new expression appeared in a deed of armistice signed by King Matthias: the document mentioned 19 noble families as \\"natural barons in Hungary\\" (barones naturales in Hungaria) in contrast to the \\"barons of the realm\\" whose position was still linked to the high offices they happened to be holding. During the reign of King Vladislaus II, the special legal position of certain noble families was enacted and the act referred to their members as \\"barons\\" even if they were not holding any high offices at that time. Although in the 16th century, the Tripartitum (a law book collecting the body of common laws that had arisen from customary practise) declared again that all the nobles enjoyed the same liberties independently of their offices, birth or wealth, but in practice, even it acknowledged that some differences had been existing within the nobility. Nevertheless, the Tripartitum still distinguished between the \\"true barons\\" (veri barones) who held the highest offices and the \\"barons only by name\\" (barones solo nomine) who did not hold any high offices but used noble titles. From 1526, the Habsburg kings rewarded their partisans with hereditary titles such as baron and count and the members of the families wearing such titles were invited to attend in person at the Diets. This costumary practise was confirmed by legislation in 1608, when the Diet passed an act prescribing that the monarchs were to send a personal invitation to the members of the upper nobility (i.e., to the \\"true barons\\" and to the nobles authorized by the kings to use hereditary titles) when convoking the Diet; thenceforward, the prelates and the members of the upper nobility formed the Diets' Upper House. Krasznahorka Castle (today Kr√°sna H√¥rka in Slovakia) - a seat of the Counts Andr√°ssy The Habsburg monarchs endeavoured to establish an \\"international\\" aristocracy within their empire and they granted several estates in the Kingdom of Hungary to their followers descending from their other realms and provinces; the Estates, however, managed to reserve the right that the kings could not grant offices and estates to foreigners without their authorization. From 1688, the members of the upper nobility were entitled by law to create an entail (fideicommissum) which ensured that their estates were inherited without division in contrast to the common law that prescribed that a noble's inheritance was to be divided equally among his heirs. The \\"cardinal liberties\\" of the nobility were abolished by the \\"April laws\\" in 1848, but the members of the upper nobility could reserve their hereditary membership in the Upper House of the Parliament. In 1885, aristocrats who did not meet all the financial criteria set up by legislation, lost their seat in the legislative body. The Upper House was dissolved in 1918 and it was reorganized only in 1926, but thenceforward, the members of the upper nobility were only entitled to elect some representatives to the Upper House. In 1945, the land reform liquidated the financial basis of the special status of the upper nobility. And finally, following the declaration of the Republic of Hungary, the Parliament passed an act that prohibited the use of noble titles in 1946.  The tribal aristocracy (9th‚Äì11th centuries)  In the 9th century, the tribal federation of the nomadic Magyars (Hetumoger) was composed of seven (and later, after the Kabars had joined to it, of eight) tribes (, ). The tribes were divided into 35-50 clans (, ). The Magyar clans must have been organized based on the real or fictitious kinship of their members; each of them had its own name (that may have been changing from time to time) and the clans possessed separate territories within the lands occupied by the tribe they were linked to. In the 9th-10th centuries, the kende, the gyula and the horka were the leaders of the Magyar tribal federation, while the tribes were headed by their own princes and each clan must have also had its own head. The \\"Horn of Lehel\\" - a horn traditionally connected to one of the leaders of the raids The Byzantine emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos recorded that Around 896, the Magyars invaded the Carpathian Basin and by 902, they occupied its whole territory. The Magyars made several raids to the territories of present- day Italy, Germany, France and Spain and also to the lands of the Byzantine Empire. The regular raids contributed to the differentiation of the tribal society because the leaders of the military actions were entitled to reserve a higher share of the booty for themselves. The military actions also contributed to the formation of the retinues of the heads of the tribes and the clans. The Magyars were obliged to stop their regular military actions westwards following their defeat at the Battle of Augsburg on the Lech River in 955; and in 970, the raids against the Byzantine Empire also finished. G√©za (before 972-997) When the period of the military raids closed, the organization of the future Kingdom of Hungary commenced during the reign of Grand Prince G√©za (before 972-997) who united the western parts of the Carpathian Basin under his rule. The establishment of the Kingdom of Hungary is connected to King Saint Stephen (1000/1001-1038); he defeated the (semi-)independent Magyar tribal leaders who endeavoured to resist his rule and thus he managed to expand his authority over the whole territory of the Carpathian Basin by the 1030s. King Stephen I organized several \\"counties\\" that became the basic units of the royal administration. Some scholarsE.g., Gyula Pauler, Gy√∂rgy Gy√∂rffy claim that King Stephen I organized the \\"counties\\" on the basis of the territories possessed by the clans, but other authorsE.g., Lajos Elekes, Gyula Krist√≥ pointed out that the relationship between the \\"counties\\" and the Magyar clans cannot be proven. King Saint Stephen's acts ensured the private ownership of landed property; therefore, several families of the tribal aristocracy (i.e., the families of the heads of the tribes and clans) acquired the ownership of parts of the lands their clans had previously possessed. Consequently, several families of the future upper nobility descended from the tribal leaders who had surrendered to King Stephen I (e.g., the Aba and Cs√°k families), and even the descendants of some rebellious tribal leaders (e.g., the kindred of Ajtony) could reserve a part of their ancestor's estates. Although King Stephen I made a concerted effort to strengthen the position of Christianity in his kingdom and he adopted severe measures against the followers of pagan customs, but several Magyar tribal leaders (including the king's nephew Levente, who died as a pagan around 1046) did not give up their former lifestyle. On the other hand, the Christian missionaries' efforts were not in vain, and several members of the tribal aristocracy (e.g., Csan√°d, one of Ajtony's former military leaders) became an ardent advocate of the Christianity; and finally, all of them who could reserve their estates integrated into the upper stratum of the Christian society following the period of the internal wars in the 1040s.  The immigrant knights (10-13th centuries)  The first knights from the western countries (mainly from the provinces of the Holy Roman Empire) arrived to Hungary during the reign of Grand Prince G√©za in the 990s and he granted several estates to them on his domains. In 997, the future King Saint Stephen could gain a victory over Kopp√°ny (his relative who claimed the throne for himself after the death of Grand Prince G√©za) with the assistance of the foreign knights serving in his German wife's retinues. The arrival of the immigrant (, ) knights continued until the end of the 13th century; several of them (e.g., the brothers Hont and P√°zm√°ny) were invited by the monarchs who offered them estates in their kingdom; others arrived in the retinues of the queens of foreign origin; while some of them was obliged to leave their country and seek shelter in the kingdom.Most of the immigrant knights were horse-mounted men-at-arms thus the maintenance of their equipment required considerable financial resources that was ensured by grant of estates.  Dignitaries and office-holders (11-13th centuries)   The formation of the Royal Council  King Saint Stephen (1000/1001-1038) The kings' (and their queens') retinues and the Royal Households became the centres where the merger of the tribal aristocracy and the immigrant knights occurred (mainly by inter- marriages) in the course of the 11-12th centuries.The decrees of King Stephen I contain clear references to the \\"men distinguished by birth and dignity\\" (, ) who can be identified with the immigrant knights and the members of the tribal aristocracy who held the highest offices at his court and in the royal administration. They formed, together with the prelates, the Royal Council (, ) which became the highest forum of political decision-making in the kingdom. Nevertheless, the monarchs remained the biggest landowners in the country until the end of the 12th century and the scattered lands owned even by the wealthiest members of the kings' retinues did not form contiguous geographical units in the kingdom. Based on their financial resources, the monarchs could reserve their overwhelming authority within their kingdom in the course of the 11-12th centuries: during the reign of King G√©za II (1141‚Äì1162), the Bishop Otto of Freising recorded that all the Hungarians  The heads of counties  Cistercian monastery in B√©lap√°tfalva - a \\"private monastery\\" built in the 13th century Among the members of the monarchs' retinues, the heads of the counties (, ) enjoyed a distinguished position: they managed the royal revenues of the \\"counties\\" and they were entitled to one third of the revenues; moreover, they led their own retinues attached to their office. They enjoyed several privileges; e.g., in their cases, the judgement was to be passed by the monarchs in person. The \\"isp√°ns\\" became the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in the country, but their appointment and dismissal depended exclusively upon the kings' favour and therefore, they could not form a hereditary aristocracy. Their financial conditions ensured that they could set up monasteries and grant possessions to them. These \\"private monasteries\\" not only served for burial place to the founder's family but their founder often reserved the \\"right of patronage\\" (, ) for himself and for his descendants.  The high-officers of the realm and of the Royal Households  Saint Ladislaus (1077-1095) The first references to an organized entourage around the monarchs were recorded during the reign of King Andrew I (1046‚Äì1060), but the development of the Royal Household (, ) must have commenced earlier.The existence of a separate Household of the Queens was documented for the first time in the 1190s. The gradual development of the Royal Households contributed to the establishment of a hierarchical structure within the nobility, because their high-officers held the highest positions within the kingdom. In practice, they not only fulfilled their duties within the Royal Households but also became heads of \\"counties\\", probably because no specific revenues were attached to their offices in the Royal Households. The decrees of King Ladislaus I (1077‚Äì1095) referred to them as \\"notabilities\\" (, ) or \\"nobles\\" (, ). From 1216, the royal charters began to use the expression \\"barons of the realm\\" (, ) when referring to the dignitaries which prove that they wanted to distinguish themselves from other nobles (e.g., from the heads of counties). They, however, could not form a hereditary aristocracy, because their title was still linked to the offices they held and the monarchs had the power to dismiss them and to promote others at any time. Some of the high- officers commenced to fulfil judiciary functions and thus they got rid of their administrative duties within the Royal Households. These high-judges and the governors of certain provinces (e.g., Transylvania, Croatia, Slavonia) formed together the high-officers of the realm who enjoyed a distinguished position within the nobility: * the Palatine (, ) administered the Royal Household in the 11-12th centuries, but later, the Palatines held the highest judiciary position within the kingdom; * the judge royal (, ) appeared in the documents around 1130, probably as the Palatine's deputy but later, the Judges of the Realm had their own sphere of jurisdiction; * the office of the Voivode of Transylvania (, ) developed from the office of the heads of Feh√©r county and its denomination was changing before the 13th century, but thenceforward, the voivodes governed Transylvania and they appointed the heads of the \\"counties\\" in the province; * the Ban of Slavonia (, ) was the governor of Slavonia from the 12th century; * the Ban of Dalmatia and Croatia (, ) governed the two kingdoms occupied by the kings of Hungary at the beginning of the 12th century; * the Ban of Macs√≥ (, ) administered the territories of the Macs√≥ (today Maƒçva in Serbia) region from the 1270s; * the Ban of Sz√∂r√©ny governed the territories attached to the Kingdom of Hungary around the Castle of Sz√∂r√©ny (today Drobeta-Turnu Severin in Romania) in the 1220s; * the master of the treasury (, ) took over the financial functions of the Judge of the Realm in the 12th century but later, the t√°rnokmesters' own sphere of jurisdiction also developed. The list of the high-officers of the Royal Households was developing gradually from the 11th century, and their functions also changed from time to time, but by the end of the 13th century, their hierarchy become consolidated: * the Marshal (, ) was the head of the royal stablemen from the 11th century and later, he led the royal armies; * the Master of the Cup-bearers (, ) served wine at the kings' table and he administered the activities of the royal wine-growers; * the Master of the Stewards (, ) served dishes at the monarch's table. * the Master of huissiers (, Latin : magister janitorum) Des assembl√©es nationales en France, Baron Henrion de Pansey, 1829, Paris  The emerging power of the feudal barons (13th century)  King B√©la III (1172‚Äì1196) was the first monarch who alienated a whole county when he granted the ownership of all the royal estates in Modru≈° county to Bartolomej, who became the ancestor of the Frankopan () family. In his grant, the king stipulated that the Counts Frankopan would be obliged to arm some horse-mounted knights for the monarchs. King Andrew II (1205‚Äì1235) radically changed the internal policy his predecessors had been following and he started to grant enormous domains to his partisans. He not only alienated castles and whole counties (i.e., the royal estates attached to them), but he also made \\"perpetual grants\\" (, ) that passed not only from fathers to sons (or in the lack of sons, to brothers or their sons) but all the male members of owner's family could inherited them. From the 1220s, several individuals commenced to refer to their clan in the official documents by using the expression de genere (\\"from the kindred of\\") following their name which suggests that the relevance even of distant kinship started to increase. The king's new policy endangered the liberties of the royal servants owning landed property in the counties that the king had granted to his partisans. Therefore, in 1222, the royal servants led by former \\"barons of the realm\\" who had been dismissed by King Andrew II enforced the king to issue the Golden Bull in order to ensure their liberties. In the Golden Bull, the king also promised that he and his successors would not grant offices to foreigners without the consent of the Royal Council The first precedent when the nobles decided on a foreigner's reception into the nobility of the kingdom was set during reign the reign of King Andrew III (1290‚Äì1301), when in 1298, the assembly of the nobility authorized the king to grant an office in the royal administration to his uncle, the Venetian Albertino Morosini. The last provision of the Golden Bull authorized the prelates and the \\"nobles\\" to resist any royal measures that could endanger their liberties confirmed by his decree. The Castle of Holl√≥k≈ë - a fortress of the Kacsics family built in the 13th century Following the Mongol invasion of the kingdom in 1241-42, King B√©la IV endeavoured the landowners to build strongholds in their domains and therefore, he often granted lands to his partisans and obliged them to have a fortress built there. As a consequence, at least 75% of the 162 fortresses built in the kingdom from 1242 until 1300 was erected on private estates. The maintenance of the fortresses required significant financial resources and therefore, the scattered character of landed property went under a radical change because the strongholds became the centres of bigger units of estates that consisted of the villages attached to them. The possession of one or more strongholds strengthened the position of the upper nobility, because the castle-owners could resist the monarchs for a longer period and they could also expand their influence over the owners of smaller estates around their castles. Based on their fortresses and retinues, the wealthier members of the landed nobility endeavoured to strengthen their own position and they often rebelled against the monarchs. They began to employ the members of the lesser nobility in their households and thus the latter (mentioned as familiaris in the deeds) became subordinate to them. A familiaris (servant) had to swear fidelity to his dominus (lord) and he fell under his lord's jurisdiction with regard to any cases connected to their special relationship. On the other hand, a familiaris reserved the ownership of his former estates and in this regard, he still fell under the jurisdiction of the royal courts of justice. Trencs√©n (today Trenƒç√≠n in Slovakia) - the seat of M√°t√© Cs√°k III From the 1290s, the most powerful barons commenced to govern their domains de facto independently of the monarchs and they usurped the royal prerogatives on the enormous territories possessed by them or by their familiaris. Following the death of King Andrew III, the largest part of the kingdom became subject to the de facto rule of oligarchs like M√°t√© Cs√°k III, Amade Aba and Ladislaus K√°n who took advantage of the struggles among the claimants to the throne and expanded their supremacy to several counties. King Charles I Robert (1308‚Äì1342) had to spend the first decades of his reign in waging wars against the most powerful oligarchs and he could strengthen his position within the kingdom only by the 1320s.  The age of chivalry (14th century)  The estates King Charles I Robert acquired by force from the rebellious oligarchs made him possible to introduce a new system in the royal administration: when he appointed his followers to an office, he also granted them the possession of one or more royal castles and the royal domains attached to them, but he reserved the ownership of the castle and its belongings for himself and thus his dignitaries could only enjoy the revenues of their possessions while they held the office. During his reign, the 20 dignitaries who held the highest offices in the royal administration or in the Royal Household obtained the honorific magnificus vir that distinguished them from other nobles. √öjlak (today Ilok in Croatia) - the seat of the √öjlaki family During his reign, members of new families attained the status of \\"barons of the realm\\"; some of the ancestors of the new families (e.g., that of the Drugeths) arrived from abroad and some of them were members of the lesser nobility (e.g., the ancestor of the √öjlaki family), but the majority of the new families (e.g., the Garai, Sz√©cs√©nyi and Sz√©csi families) descended from clans whose members had already held high-offices in the 13th century The king introduced a new royal prerogative in 1332 when he entitled Margaret de genere N√°dasd to inherit her father's possessions in contradiction to the customs of the kingdom prescribing that daughters can inherit only one-fourth of their father's estates and the other parts of the estates should pass to his agnates. Thenceforward, the monarchs could strengthen the financial conditions of their followers by using the prerogative of \\"prefection\\" (, ) and thus entitling their wives to inherit their fathers' possessions. King Charles I Robert also set himself against the customs of the kingdom, when he granted landed property to his followers but he stipulated that the property could only be inherited by their descendants and thus he excluded their agnates from the inheritance. King Charles I Robert endeavoured the implementation of the ideas of chivalry; in 1318, he established the Order of Saint George whose membership was limited to 50 knights. He also set up the body of \\"knights-at-the-court\\" (, ) who acted as his personal delegates on an ad hoc basis. Thenceforward, most of the \\"barons of the realm\\" were appointed among the knights-at-the court. Before being knighted, children of the upper nobility could serve as pages (, ) in the Royal Households, and when they grow up they became \\"juveniles-at-the court\\" (, ). King Charles I Robert was the first king of Hungary who granted crests to his followers; the Hungarian word for coat-of-arms (c√≠mer) derives from the French expression for the crest (cimier). In 1351, King Louis I (1342‚Äì1382) issued a new decree that modified the Golden Bull and introduced the entail system (, ) when regulating the inheritance of the nobles' estates; according to the new system, the nobles' real property could not be devised by will, but it passed by operation of law to the owner's heirs upon his death. During his reign, the members of the Bebek, Cudar and Lackfi families attained the status of \\"baron of the realm\\".  The rule of the barons' leagues  Sigismund (1387-1437) Following the death of King Louis I, his daughter Queen Mary I (1382‚Äì1385, 1386‚Äì1395) acceded to the throne, but the majority of the nobles opposed her rule. In 1385, the young queen had to abdicate in favor of her distant cousin, King Charles II (1385‚Äì1386), but her partisans murdered the new king soon and thus she could ascend the throne again. However, the followers of her murdered opponent's son, King Ladislaus of Naples rose up in open rebellion and captured her; thus the realm stayed without a monarch. At that moment, the prelates and the \\"barons of the realm\\" set up a council; they have a seal prepared with the inscription \\"Seal of the People of the Kingdom of Hungary\\" () and issued decrees sealed by it in the name of the \\"prelates, barons, notabilities and all nobles of the realm\\". The members of the council entered into a contract with Queen Mary's fianc√© and elected him king; in the contract, King Sigismund (1387‚Äì1437) accepted that his The contract also recorded that the king and his counsillors would form a league and according to their contract, the king could not dismiss his counsillors without the consent of the other members of the Royal Council. The contract suggests that the members of the Royal Council endeavored to strengthen the hereditary character of their position. The first league was led by the Palatine Stephen II Lackfi and the Archbishop John Kanizsai, but the latter could drive the former out of the power in 1397. However, King Sigismund favorized his counsillors of foreign origin (e.g., his favourite was the Polish Stibor of Stiboricz) which resulted in his imprisonment, in 1401, by the discontent members of the Royal Council led by the Archbishop John Kanizsai, but he managed to conclude a new agreement with some members of the Royal Council who set him free. Reconstruction of the insignia of the Order of the Dragon The public law of the kingdom also started to differentiate the descendants of the \\"barons of the realm\\", even if they did not held any higher offices, from other nobles: the Act of 1397 referred to them as the \\"barons' sons\\" (, ) while later documents called them \\"magnates\\" (, ). From the 1430s, the \\"magnates\\" received the honorific magnificus, an expression that had earlier been used only when addressing the \\"barons of the realm\\". During his reign, King Sigismund granted several royal castles and the royal domains attached to them to the members of the barons' leagues; by 1407, the number of royal castles decreased from 111 to 66. The king, however, wanted to strengthen his position and for this purpose, in 1408, he founded the Order of the Dragon, a chivalric order whose 22 members (e.g., the Palatine Nicholas II Garai, count Hermann II of Celje, Stibor of Stiboricz and the Despot Stefan Lazareviƒá) swore fidelity to the king, his queen and their future children. Some signs of the increasing self-consciousness of the \\"magnates\\" appeared in the 1420s. Some of them commenced to use names that referred to the high office their ancestors had held; e.g., the members of the Losonci family started to call themselves B√°nfi meaning the \\"son of a Ban\\" in reference to their forefather who had been the Ban of Dalmatia and Croatia. Other magnates clearly referred to their descent from former \\"barons of the realm\\" in their deeds or used noble titles (such as \\"count\\" or \\"duke\\") abroad following the example of the western nobility although the public law of the kingdom did not accept their claim to distinctive titles. When King Sigismund's son-in-law, Albert I (1437‚Äì1439) was proclaimed king, he had to take a solemn oath that he would exercise his prerogative powers only with the consent of the Royal Council. Following King Albert's death, a civil war broke out between the followers of his posthumous son, King Ladislaus V (1440‚Äì1457) and the partisans of his opponent, King Vladislaus I (1440‚Äì1444). Between 1440 and 1458, the Diet was convoked in each year (with the exception of 1443 and 1449) and it was involved in the legislative process of law-making: the bills were passed by the Diet before receiving the Royal Assent. When the monarch (or the regent) convoked the Diet, he sent a personal invitation to the prelates, \\"barons of the realm\\" and \\"magnates\\" and they attended in person at the assembly, while other nobles were usually represented by their deputies. Consequently, the Diets were dominated by the \\"magnates\\" not only because of their personal presence, but also because of the tendency that the counties elected their partisans as their own delegates. In 1445, the Diet elected seven Captains General (, ) in order to govern the kingdom during the absence of King Vladislaus I (who actually had fallen in the Battle of Varna). In 1446, the assembly of the Estates proclaimed John Hunyadi to Regent and he was to govern the realm in cooperation with the Estates until 1453 when King Ladislaus V returned to the kingdom. John Hunyadi was the first temporal \\"magnate\\" who received a hereditary title from a king of Hungary: in 1453, King Ladislaus V appointed him the hereditary head (, ) of Beszterce county (now Bistri≈£a in Romania) and thus he became a count in the sense similar to the title's usage in the western countries. Although, some of the immigrant \\"magnates\\"E.g., Prince Fyodor Koriatovych, the counts Hermann and Ulrich of Cille and the Despots Stefan Lazareviƒá and George Brankoviƒá. had already used honorary titles before and they were often mentioned even in official documents with a reference to their title,E.g., Article 25 of the Act of 1439 and Article 9 of the Act of 1454. but their title was granted by foreign monarchs and the public law in the Kingdom of Hungary did not recognize any special privileges connected to it.  The legal separation of the hereditary aristocracy  Matthias I the Just (1458-1490) John Hunyadi's son, Matthias I (1458‚Äì1490) was proclaimed king by the Estates, but he had to wage war against Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor who claimed the throne for himself. Several magnates supported the emperor's claim and proclaimed him king against King Matthias; the emperor rewarded the brothers Sigismund and John of Szentgy√∂rgy and Bazin with the hereditary noble title \\"count of the Holy Roman Empire\\" in 1459 and thus they became entitled to use red sealing wax. Although the Counts Szentgy√∂rgyi commenced to use their title in their deeds, but in the Kingdom of Hungary, public law did not distinguish them from other nobles. King Matthias I also rewarded his partisans with hereditary titles and appointed them hereditary heads of counties: John Vitovec became the hereditary head of Zagorje county in 1463; Emeric Szapolyai received the honor of Szepes county in 1465; in 1467, Nicholas Csupor de Monoszl√≥ and John Ernuszt were appointed to hereditary head of Ver≈ëce county and Tur√≥c county respectively; in the 1480s, Nicholas B√°nffy de Als√≥lendva and Peter and Matthias Ger√©b received such hereditary titles. The hereditary heads of counties were entitled, similarly to the \\"counts of the Holy Roman Empire\\", to use red sealing was. Moreover, during his reign, all the members of the wealthier families descending from the \\"barons of the realm\\" received the honorific magnificus which was a next step towards their separation from other nobles. Vladislaus II the \\"Dob≈æe\\" (1490-1516) In 1487, a new expression appeared in a deed of armistice signed by King Matthias: 18 familiesThe families B√°nfi de Als√≥lendva, B√°thory, de Corbavia (Korb√°viai), Ellerbach, Ernuszt, Garai, Frankopan (Frangep√°n), H√©derv√°ry, Losonci, M√≥ric de Meggyesalja, Orsz√°g de Gut, Paksi, Paumkirchner, Per√©nyi, Rozgonyi, Szapolyai, Szentgy√∂rgyi, √öjlaki (F√ºgedi, Erik op. cit. p. 385). were referred to as \\"natural barons of Hungary\\" (, ) in contrast to the \\"barons of the realm\\" who were still the holders of the highest offices in the public administration and the Royal Households. One of the 19 families (the √öjlaki family) was styled \\"duke\\" in the deed, while other four families were styled \\"count\\" - the latter group included the Szentgy√∂rgyi family which suggests that King Matthias accepted the title his opponent had granted to them. During the reign of King Vladislaus II (1490‚Äì1516), the Diet unambiguosly expressed that certain noble familiesThe families B√°nfi de Als√≥lendva, B√°nfi de Bolond√≥c, B√°thory, Bebek, Beriszl√≥, Both de Bajna, Brankoviƒá (Brankovics), de Corbavia (Korb√°viai), Dr√°gffy, Drugeth, Ellerbach, Ernuszt, Frankop√°n (Frangep√°n), Ger√©b de Ving√°rt, H√©derv√°ry, Jakich de Nagylak, Kanizsai, L√©vai, Losonci, Kompolth de Gut, Ongor de N√°dasd, Orsz√°g de N√°na, Paumkirchner, P√°l√≥czi, Per√©nyi, Pongr√°cz de Dengeleg, R√°skai, Rozgonyi, Szapolyai, Szentgy√∂rgyi, Sz√©csi, Szokoli, √öjlaki (Article 22 of the Act of 1498). were in a distinguished position and mentioned them as barons irrespectively of the office they held. The Diet prescribed that the barons were to arm soldiers pursuant to the number of the landed villeins who lived on their domains which prove that by that time, public law had acknowledged their special legal status and their privilege to use distinctive titles.

He is known as the second person to record a Cajun record and the first to record this genre with a fiddle. Family Born January 19, 1904 in Ville Platte, Louisiana, Soileau started playing music at 12 years old and made a few dollars each night. Music and career After Joe Falcon's recording of \\"Allons a Lafayette\\" became a hit, record companies were interested in finding other talent. A jeweler, Frank Deitlein of Opelousas, Louisiana, convinced Victor Records to record Soileau and Mayeus Lafleur of Basile, Louisiana and in October 18, 1928, they recorded four songs with Victor in Atlanta, Georgia. With Soileau on fiddle and Mayeus on vocal and accordion, their recording of \\"Mama, Where You At?\\" (also referred to as \\"Chere Mom\\") became the most influential, mainly due to Lafleur's lyrics describing his longing for his mother. After Lafleur was killed in a quarrel over moonshine, gunned down by a stray bullet at a honky-tonk bar in Basile just nine days after the recording, Soileau began recording for Victor and Vocalion with fellow accordionist Moise Robin of Arnaudville, Louisiana the following year. The next month, he teamed up with his cousin, Alius Soileau of Eunice, Louisiana, and recorded four more songs as the duo \\"Soileau Couzens\\" in New Orleans as well as with accordionist Oscar \\"Slim\\" Doucet. The following day, he would record with Wilfred Fruge. After the depression, he continued to play dances throughout Louisiana and Texas. In 1934, he started a group called the Three Aces with Floyd Shreve on guitar or Bill Dewey Landry on guitar and Tony Gonzales on drums. Without the accordion, the sound would be country influenced. Soileau would begin recording for Bluebird Records and a major part of inspiration came from western swing, blues, ragtime, and fiddle music of Texas. The following year, he would sign with Decca Records, travel to Chicago, and change the name to the Four Aces. He would record again for Decca in New Orleans in 1936 and Dallas in 1937. After the Four Aces broke away as a separate band, Soileau played with a group he called the Rhythm Boys. Soileau recorded Cajun music until the start of World War II until Decca decided to stop recording Cajun artists. He continued to perform with his group The Rhythm Boys at places such as the Silver Star in Lake Charles, Louisiana, Showboat in Orange, Texas and Lighthouse in Port Arthur, Texas, until the end of the decade when in 1953 he retired playing music. Soileau made frequent broadcasts over KVOL in Lafayette, Louisiana, KPLC in Lake Charles, Louisiana and KWKH in Shreveport, Louisiana. He continued working in an oil refinery and as a janitor retiring completely in the late 1960s. He died in 1980. * Mom, Where You At? * Hackberry Hop * La Blues De Port Arthur Discography Compilations * Early Rural String Bands (LPV-552 RCA Victor, 1968) * Early American Cajun Music: The Early Recordings of Leo Soileau (2041 Yazoo Records, January 19, 1999) * Leo Soileau: Louisiana Cajun Music Vol. 7 (LP125 Arhoolie) * Le Gran Mamou: A Cajun Music Anthology - The Historic Victor‚ÄìBluebird Sessions 1928‚Äì1941 Vol. 1 (CMF-013-D Country Music Foundation, 1990) See also * List of people related to Cajun music * History of Cajun Music References 1904 births 1980 deaths People from Ville Platte, Louisiana American folk musicians Musicians from Louisiana Cajun fiddlers 20th- century violinists 20th-century American musicians Bluebird Records artists ","title":"Leo Soileau"},{"id":"19140204","title":"Members of the Western Australian Legislative Council, 1956‚Äì1958"},{"id":"19140226","text":"', ', or ' () is the Japanese word for \\"boy\\" or \\"minor\\".

Mosby and Union forces under Major Joseph GilmoreWert, p. 44, uses the name \\"a Major Gilmer.\\" The personnel roster of the 18th Pennsylvania lists no Gilmer, but does list Joseph Gilmore, promoted to major on November 28, 1862. and Captain Franklin T. Huntoon in Aldie, Virginia, on March 2, 1863, as part of Mosby's Operations in Northern Virginia during the American Civil War. The fight which resulted in a Confederate victory was significant in that it was the first action of Mosby's Rangers within their operating territory in the central Loudoun Valley. In the fight Mosby and his men displayed many characteristics that would become their hallmark including the attack on numerically superior force while inflicting disproportionate casualties to those received. Background On January 24, 1863, Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart dispatched his scout John S. Mosby and 15 of his cavaliers to the lower Loudoun Valley in Fauquier County to conduct operations against Union forces occupying Northern Virginia. On January 28, the small band met at Mount Zion church, east of Aldie and set on their first raid against Federals in Chantilly. During the next month, Mosby and his men raided into Fairfax County twice more, besting larger Federal forces each time. On March 2, in response to the raids, Colonel Sir Percy Wyndham dispatched 200 troopers of the 18th Pennsylvania under Major Joseph Gilmore from Fairfax towards Middleburg to find and capture Mosby and his men. In the town, the Union force, many of whom were reportedly drunk, began searching local residences and arresting citizens in an attempt to smoke out Mosby's men. When this proved to be unsuccessful, Gilmore threatened to burn the town. Residents of the village, pleaded with Gilmore to spare them, claiming to have no knowledge of the whereabouts of Mosby's men. Gilmore apparently believed them and withdrew with his command east, toward Aldie. At Aldie, the 18th Pennsylvania encountered a 50-man detachment of the 1st Vermont on similar patrol in Loudoun. The drunken Major Gilmore mistook the 1st Vermont for Confederates and ordered a retreat. The 1st Vermont, overtook the 18th Pennsylvania and the mistake was recognized. The 18th Pennsylvania informed the 1st Vermont of their failure to locate Mosby and then withdrew for Fairfax, while the 1st Vermont returned to Aldie to water their mounts. The fight The Federal raid on Middleburg did not go unnoticed by Mosby. As soon as the Federals left the town, he quickly assembled as many men as possible, totaling between 17 and 28, and then set out towards Aldie in pursuit. As Mosby's men entered the village from the west, they spied the dismounted 1st Vermont. Mosby immediately ordered a charge and with a yell the Confederates bore down on the Federals, taking them by surprise and sending most of them into a wild retreat. In the midst of the charge, Mosby lost control of his horse and was forced to jump off, losing it to the Federals. During the fight Captain John W. Woodward of the 1st Vermont had his horse shot out from underneath him, pinning him to the ground. One of Mosby's men ran towards him to shoot him, but Woodward was able to draw a concealed pistol and shoot his assailant. Believing that Woodward had already surrendered when he fired the shot a few of Mosby's men rushed in to execute him, but Mosby, who witnessed the affair, quickly interceded, taking the captain prisoner. Aftermath Despite losing his horse, Mosby and his men handled themselves well, capturing 19 Federals, including two captains and 23 horses, while suffering only one wounded. In response to the raid into his territory, Mosby planned another raid on Federals in Fairfax to capture the cavalry commander Sir Percy Wyndham on March 9. The result of this action would be Mosby's most famous exploit of the war, the Stoughton Raid. In addition, for defending the town of Middleburg and severely embarrassing the Federals sent to raid it, Mosby and his men won the admiration of the town's citizens, who had to this point been weary of the partisans. The support of the people of the Loudoun Valley would become one of Mosby's greatest assets for the duration of the war.

In March 1943, Warner Brothers purchased the film rights to the play. Miramova earned $250,000 in the transaction, but the planned movie was never made. In addition to its theatrical success, Dark Eyes also provided a rare insight into Miramova's psyche. She played the character Tonia Karpova, and during a 1943 interview with The New York Times, she described both herself and her stage alter-ego as \\"not a plate of sex appeal, but kind, metaphysical, and trying very hard to keep a belief in God\\"; the interviewer characterized Miramova, like Tonia, as delicately feminine, intelligent, strong, and enduring. She began work on a second play in 1944, a comedy about a mother and daughter, but this work apparently was never completed.\\"News and Gossip of the Rialto\\"], The New York Times, 2 January 1944. Marriage and final years In May 1945, she married army captain Byron Carr Moore in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.\\"Elena Miramova Is Wed.\\" The New York Times. 28 May 1945. Her theatrical career seems to have ended at this time, as no further mention of her in print sources in English can be found. She spent the winter of 1946-7 in Iceland, where her husband had been hired by the recently founded Icelandic airline Loftlei√∞ir to train their first pilots. During the year that Miramova spent in Iceland, she was a regular visitor to the house of Halld√≥r Laxness, who received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1955. Miramova gave at least one private reading of her \\"new play\\" at Laxness' house. In her memoirs, Laxness' wife Au√∞ur fondly remembers Miramova, whom she calls \\"one of those enchanting women one can never forget\\".Laxness, Au√∞ur and Edda Andr√©sd√≥ttir. √Å Glj√∫frasteini, Reykjav√≠k: Vaka-b√≥kaforlag, p. 56.

The village sits adjacent to the River Annan, and was the concept of the Paisley Dirom family of Mount Annan and building started about 1822. Excerpts From 'Our Village Brydekirk' - Produced by the children of Brydekirk School in 2014. The original village was called Bridechapel and was north west of what is now Brydekirk Mains farm. In 1507, over 500 years ago, it was known as Bridechapel, in 1517 Brydekyrk and in 1660 Brydekirk. It had its own water at St Brydes Well and the spring is still there 500 years later. The pond which is over grown was the village pond at Brydekirk Mains Farm. You may see signs of the old village. The chapel had a rough stone wall surrounding it, it was in 1100 over 900 years ago. We also found out before Dirom‚Äôs time the village north west of Brydekirk called Brydechaple was built round a small chaple dedicated to Saint Bryde, or Saint B9riget born 452. In 1983 it was excavated by archaeologists they found coins dating back to 1496 these are in the Dumfries Museum. Mains Farm. The Bell family have lived there for over 200 years. Mr Bell showed us the oldest part of the tower. We saw St Brides Tower it is about 15m high. The people lived above and the animals lived underneath to help keep the people warm. You could still see the beams that held the floor where the people lived. Mr Bell also showed us a pond in front of the farm where water was dammed so it could power the waterwheel. Brydekirk Mains Farm had their own corn mill and Mr Bell said his father can remember it working over 70 years ago. Mr Bell also said the Quarry, where the boys from school probably went to work, was nearly all filled in. It is about a field away from the school park. That field is known locally as ‚ÄúThe American‚Äù because of its size. A landowner Lieutenant General Alexander Dirom wanted to build an industrial village by the River Annan to increase the value of his land. Dirom made a great many plans for Brydekirk. Dirom was born in 1757 at Banff near Aberdeen and came to Annan when he married Miss Magdalene Paisley the heiress of mount Annan Estate. They lived at mount Annan for many years had 7 sons and 5 daughters. He died in October 1830 at mount Annan Aged 74. The first job was to make the planned village easy to get to. He had to build roads and between 1799 and 1800 a bridge. A stone bridge with three arches went over the river Annan, that‚Äôs over 200 years ago. Now Dirom had four roads that came into Brydekirk. He made a new road from Mount Annan to Brydekirk one mile with a gate and a porter‚Äôs lodge at each end. Dirom was interested in the river to power all the industries of Brydekirk including a corn mill, woollen mill and a bleach field to bleach the cloth by the sun. Dirom was also interested in quarrying his lands fine sandstone from Corsehill and a lime from a quarry at Brownmoor. In 1791 over 200 years ago he tried to bore for coal but was unsuccessful. The houses were to be built by the people themselves and then a set rent was paid to Dirom. He wanted hardworking people to live in his village. The first six houses were built by Dirom. The houses were all built to his plan; each had a slated roof and was built with limestone from quarries at Brownmoor. Each house was to be white washed in the spring of every year, the cottages were said to glisten in the sun and Brydekirk was nicknamed ‚ÄúThe White Wash City‚Äù. In 1837, over 200 years ago the list of people in the village were, 1 clergy, 2 clog makers, 1 cooper, 3 grocers and spirit dealer, 4 mason builders, 1 miller, 1 tailor, 1 vinter, 1 flax dresser and 2 black smiths. The village was thriving but Dirom never completed his elaborate plan. New power came along like steam and water power was not going to last. Dirom died in October 1830 at Mount Annan Aged 74. This is Annan old Parish Churchyard the burial ground of Lieutenant General Dirom of Mount Annan and his family.

It also premiered at the Polish Film Festival, at the West London Synagogue, in London, on March 19, 2007. Updated announcement of screenings of premiere, at the Polish Film Festival, co-hosted by The Spiro Ark and the London Polish Cultural Institute, at West London Synagogue, in London, March 19, 2007, and April 22, 2007 (second screening). (Illustrated.) Background In August 1940, when he was 23, after fleeing the Nazi occupation of ≈ªywiec, his home town in southern Poland, Wilhelm Brasse was captured at the Polish- Hungarian border and deported to KL Auschwitz-Birkenau, as prisoner number 3444. Trained before the beginning of World War II as a portrait photographer at his aunt's studio, he was ordered by his SS supervisors to photograph \\"what they told him to photograph: prisoners' work, criminal medical experiments, portraits of the prisoners for the files.\\" Brasse has estimated that he took about 40,000 to 50,000 \\"identity pictures\\" from 1940 until 1945, before being forcibly moved to another concentration camp in Austria, where he was liberated by the American forces in May 1945. (Google Books provides hyperlinked \\"Preview\\".) While not all of Brasse's photographs are extant, 40,000 that did survive are kept in archives, with some on display, at the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, and at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority, Israel's official memorial to the Jewish victims of the Holocaust, and some of the Auschwitz-Birkinau State Museum archival photographs and related iconography are presented visually in the film, with narration through interviews with Brasse. Synopsis Portrecista (The Portraitist) examines the life and work of Wilhelm Brasse, who had been trained as a portrait photographer at his aunt's studio prior to World War II and passionately loved taking photographs. After his capture and imprisonment by the Nazis at Auschwitz concentration camp in 1940, at the age of 23, he was forced to take \\"identity pictures\\" of between approximately 40,000 to 50,000 other inmates between 1940 and 1945. With \\"courage and skill\\", documenting \\"cruelty which goes beyond all words ... for future generations\\", after his liberation at the end of World War II, Brasse \\"could not continue with his profession\\" and would never take another photograph. In Portrecista Brasse relates the \\"story behind some pictures in the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum archives that he remembers taking,\\" which is \\"illustrated with archive stock and iconography.\\" Production details and screenings Written, directed, and edited by Irek Dobrowolski, produced by Anna Dobrowolska for TVP1, Poland, and filmed by cinematographer Jacek Taszakowski, this documentary film, starring Wilhelm Brasse (as himself), was first shown in the \\"Proud to Present\\" series on the Polish television station TVP1 on January 24, 2006, and then was shown at the Warsaw International Film Festival's \\"Jewish Motives\\" division, where it won the Grand Prix \\"Golden Phoenix of Warsaw\\" and at the 46th Krak√≥w Film Festival, where it won the National Competition Silver \\"Lajkonik\\". Its English premiere as The Portraitist was at the Polish Film Festival, at West London Synagogue, in London, on March 19, 2007, with a second screening by popular demand, on April 22, 2007, and, after the premiere, the audience participated in a \\"Q&A;\\" with Dobrowolski and Brasse. It was also screened at other Polish film festivals throughout Europe and film festivals in North America and garnered some additional awards.Some of the film's other festival screenings and awards are also listed at the official Website of Rekontrplan Film Group, its distributor. Selected critical responses In her 2004 book Photographing the Holocaust: Interpreting the Evidence, published a year before the release of this film, Auschwitz historian Janina Struk recounted \\"the history of the use and abuse of Holocaust photographs\\" depicting atrocities. Struk interviewed Brasse for her book in 2000. At the camp's photo processing room, he saw the footage of Soviet POWs being massacred with axes outside Block 11, and said, that he will never forget the scenes in this film made by SS man Walter using his 16mm Agfa Monik film camera. The Germans keen on documenting the industrial nature of murder did not possess the knowledge and skills of photo lab technicians, and relegated the work to Erkennungsdienst prisoners like Brasse, \\"the portraitist\\" of Auschwitz.Struk, 2004. Chapter 5: Cameras in the Camps, pp. 103-108. Note 17. Author's interview with Wilhelm Brasse, Poland, 2000. Previewing the film, in his April 2007 profile of Brasse, \\"Returning to Auschwitz: Photographs from Hell\\", Keane writes: \\"Brasse has left us with a powerful legacy in images. Because of them we can see the victims of the Holocaust as human and not statistics. ... The photographs are the work of a man who fought to keep his humanity alive in a place of unimaginable evil.\\" The film program of the Toronto Photography Festival 'Contact 2008' held throughout the month of May, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where The Portraitist was shown on May 10, says that \\"Brasse tells his story with chilling simplicity and haunting detail\\", noting that some images may disturb. In reviewing the Contact 2008 screening, Fran Schechter observes that \\"Director Ireneusz Dobrowolski mixes the recollections of the now elderly survivor [Wilhelm Brasse] with a gallery of mug shots and SS portraits and wartime film footage of ghettos and concentration camps.\\" Schechter notes: \\"Any Holocaust testimony has an impact\\", but adds: \\"this film could have delved deeper into the question of why the Nazis made photographs and other documentation of people they considered expendable\\", and is left wondering: \\"Were they proud of their savage efficiency, or using photography to normalize their actions?\\" Such questions lead to another controversial subject: \\"the roots of Nazi psychology\\", the title of a 2000 book by Jay Y. Gonen.

It is in Troqueer parish, in the historic county of Kirkcudbrightshire.  Etymology  Cargenbridge takes its name from a bridge over the Cargen Water. The name dates back to at least 1753, when 'Cargen bridge croft' is recorded in the Kirkcudbrightshire land tax roll. Cargen itself has a number of possible Cumbric etymologies. It may be a compound formed from cajr 'enclosed, defensible site' and one of the following elements, which likely refer to an earlier name for Cargen Water: * gein[d] (from earlier can[d]) 'white; bright, clear' * geint (from earlier cant) 'a corner, an oblique angle; boundary' * gƒô:n (from earlier c·∫πin) 'fresh'. * gejn (from earlier ceŒº-) 'ridge' Alternatively, it may be from the root carreg 'a rock, a rocky place' + the suffix -an. It may also be Gaelic carraig√≠n 'little rock'.  History  Cargenbridge is referred to as a 'village' in 1848 in the entry for 'Cargen Bridge Smithy' in the Ordnance Survey Name Book. In 1962, it is recorded that the population quadrupled following the building of 36 new local authority houses. Despite being close to Dumfries, Cargenbridge remained in Kirkcudbrightshire when part of Troqueer parish was taken into Dumfriesshire as part of the amalgamation of the burghs of Dumfries and Maxwelltown. The extension of the boundaries of the county of Dumfriesshire over the River Nith did not extend as far as Cargenbridge. Curriestanes cursus, a large Neolithic monument now only visible as a crop mark, sits just above the village. It is, along with Pict's Knowe, one of two scheduled monuments in Troqueer parish.  Education  The earliest school in the vicinity of Cargenbridge was Doweel school, opened at the beginning of the eighteenth century. The Rev. William Somervell (died 1698), minister of Troqueer parish, left money to found the school. This became Drumsleet, a two- teacher school. Both Drumsleet and the single-teacher Whinnyhill school were made redundant in 1959 when Cargenbridge secondary and primary school opened. The building, described in 1962 as a \\"very modern school\\", was opened in October by the Earl of Galloway. It was designed by Eric W. Hall. The former Drumsleet school became a community centre. In 1962 the primary school had three teachers and 80 pupils and the secondary school had 14 teachers and 144 pupils. The secondary school was closed between September 1982 and September 1984. The current Cargenbridge Primary School building was opened in 2009.

A wealthy man from his locale, Cheng Chubin () was impressed with L√º's talent and believed that he would one day be successful, and Cheng decided to give his daughter to L√º in marriage. After the marriage, both Cheng Chubin and his son Cheng Zhen () supported L√º financially, allowing L√º to visit the Tang Dynasty capital Chang'an.Old Book of Tang, vol. 185, part 2 . Early in Emperor Xuanzong's Tianbao era (742-756), L√º passed the imperial examinations and was made the sheriff of Ningling County. The surveyor of the circuit, Wei Zhi (), was impressed with L√º's talent and recommended him to serve as deputy surveyor. Later, Geshu Han, the military governor (jiedushi) of Longyou (Èö¥Âè≥, headquartered in modern Haidong Prefecture, Qinghai) and Hexi (Ê≤≥Ë•ø, headquartered in modern Wuwei, Gansu) Circuits invited him to serve on staff as treasurer. While serving under Geshu, it was said that L√º was careful and hardworking, and at times, when his colleagues would be spending time out of the office, L√º would be in his office to review the files. This diligence caused Geshu to favor him more. In 755, the general An Lushan rebelled at Fanyang Circuit (ËåÉÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Beijing) and quickly attacked south, capturing the Tang eastern capital Luoyang and establishing a new state of Yan. Geshu was commissioned to try to block Yan advances at Tong Pass, but was defeated there in 756, forcing Emperor Xuanzong to flee Chang'an to Chengdu. Emperor Xuanzong's son and crown prince Li Heng, however, did not follow him to Chengdu, but instead fled to Lingwu, where he was proclaimed emperor (as Emperor Suzong), an action that Emperor Xuanzong later recognized. L√º, who had been still serving under Geshu at the time Geshu was defeated, fled to Lingwu as well. After the eunuchs Zhu Guanghui () and Li Zunzou () recommended him, Emperor Suzong met him and was impressed with him, and thus made him deputy chief imperial censor (Âæ°Âè≤‰∏≠‰∏û, Yushi Zhongcheng), often listening to his advice. After Emperor Suzong moved his headquarters to Fengxiang (È≥≥Áøî, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) in 757, he made L√º the deputy minister of defense (Ê≠¶ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Wubu Shilang) and further allowed L√º to wear a gold and purple robe, generally reserved for higher-ranking officials. After Emperor Suzong recaptured Chang'an and Luoyang later in 757, L√º was one of the officials, along with Li Xian and Cui Qi (), who adjudicated the cases of former Tang officials who had submitted to Yan as subjects. It was said that both L√º and Cui were harsh while Li Xian was more merciful, and that L√º's harshness brought much disdain for him.  As chancellor  In spring 759, L√º Yin, then still deputy minister of defense, was given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor de facto, and he was also made in charge of the examination bureau of government (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng) even though he carried no official responsibility at the examination bureau. (This was part of a reorganization of Emperor Suzong's administration, as Emperor Suzong simultaneously also made Li Xian, Li Kui, and Diwu Qi chancellors while removing Miao Jinqing and Wang Yu.) In summer 759, after his mother died, he left public service briefly, but was recalled to the same posts three months later, and was additionally given the office of special taxation emissary (Â∫¶ÊîØ‰Ωø, Duzhi Shi). He was also created the Count of Xuchang and made Huangmen Shilang (), the deputy head of the examination bureau. In early 760, Emperor Suzong gave him the greater chancellor de facto designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin ()However, the table of chancellors in the New Book of Tang made no mention of this designation. Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 185, part 2 and New Book of Tang, vol. 140 with New Book of Tang, vol. 62 . and awarded him a ceremonial ji (halberd). L√º, believing it to be inappropriate to receive such honors in mourning clothes, took off his mourning clothes‚Äîand this drew much criticism from others. During the time that L√º served as chancellor, he drew further criticism by making his father- in-law Cheng Chubin a deputy minister and brother-in-law Cheng Zhen a junior official. Further, he had a close association with the eunuch Ma Shangyan (). When Ma received the bribe from a reserve official who sought to be the sheriff of Lantian County (ËóçÁî∞, near Chang'an), he requested L√º to make that person the sheriff of Lantian County. L√º did so. When this was discovered in summer 760, Emperor Suzong, in anger, battered Ma to death and had Ma's subordinates consume his flesh. L√º was not killed, but was removed from his chancellor position, to serve on the staff of Emperor Suzong's crown prince Li Yu instead.  After serving as chancellor  Two months later, L√º Yin was made the secretary general at Jing Prefecture (ËçäÂ∑û, roughly modern Jingzhou, Hubei), as well as the military governor of the five surrounding prefectures. Once he was at Jing Prefecture, he requested that Emperor Suzong designate the prefectural capital Jiangling as a special municipality and the southern capital. Emperor Suzong agreed and converted Jing Prefecture into Jiangling Municipality, making L√º its mayor. Further, at L√º's request, he also ordered 3,000 soldiers to be stationed at Jiangling to block off any potential rebellions in the region. Further, he also added seven prefectures to L√º's area of responsibility. Prior to L√º's arrival, his office was occupied by the general Zhang Weiyi (). Zhang, however, was often intimidated by his subordinate Chen Xi'ang () -- who controlled his own private army at his home prefecture of Heng Prefecture (near modern Hengyang, Hunan) and ruled it as a private fief. On one occasion, Chen, who had an enmity with his colleague Mou Suijin (), took his own soldiers into Zhang's mansion, demanding that Zhang order Mou beheaded. Zhang, in fear, ordered Mou's execution, and thereafter, Chen dominated the affairs at headquarters. When L√º arrived at his post, he initially ingratiated Chen by recommending him for promotion, and then killed him by a surprise attack. L√º was thereafter able to control headquarters. On another occasion, there had been a sorcerer Shen Taizhi (), who ingratiated the powerful eunuch Li Fuguo by using sorcery on Li Fuguo's behalf. Through Li Fuguo's influence, Shen was made a commanding army officer at Dao Prefecture (ÈÅìÂ∑û, in modern Yongzhou, Hunan). Shen was corrupt and extorted much wealth from the local non-Han population. Pang Chengding (), the prefect of nearby Tan Prefecture (in modern Changsha, Hunan), had long been angry about Shen's corruption, and on one occasion, when Shen was in Tan Prefecture, Pang apprehended him and seized the ill-gotten gains, and then submitted an accusation against Shen. Both Shen and Pang were taken to Chang'an, and because of Shen's association with Li Fuguo, Li Fuguo cleared him and accused Pang of false accusations. He ordered L√º to investigate. L√º had his subordinate Yan Ying () investigate and submit a report clearing Pang and confirming Shen's guilt. Emperor Suzong, influenced greatly by Li Fuguo, however, ordered Pang executed and Yan exiled. L√º strenuously objected, despite the dangers in doing so, but was unable to save Pang or Yan at that point; this, however, made people much more respectful of L√º, and ultimately, Shen's guilt was shown, and he was executed while Pang was posthumously restored. While L√º was chancellor, he had a poor relationship with his colleague Li Kui. As L√º gained a good reputation while at Jing Prefecture, Li Kui was displeased. Li Kui therefore proposed that armies under L√º's command be disbanded, arguing that the region did not need soldiers, and also often sent examiners to L√º's region of responsibility, seeking to find L√º's faults. L√º reported this to Emperor Suzong and defended himself. As a result, Li Kui was removed from his chancellor position and demoted to be a prefect. L√º died in 762 and was given posthumous honors. The New Book of Tang had this commentary about L√º:New Book of Tang, vol. 140. While serving at Jing Prefecture, L√º also heard about the talents of the officials Du Hongjian and Yuan Zai and recommended them. Both later became chancellors.

The film was originally marketed to an online audience. The film alleges that the terrorism charges brought against the \\"Toronto 18\\" were largely exaggerated or fabricated by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) in order to justify the controversial Canadian Anti-Terrorism Act, and increased funding for security and law enforcement.  Areas of controversy   Suspicious timing/circumstances surrounding the arrests  The film refers to an article in Maclean's magazine, in which Muslim politician Wajid Khan tacitly admits that surveillance on at least one suspect was the result of him speaking out against Canada's role in the War in Afghanistan. The film also scrutinizes the politically sensitive timing of the arrests, since they were carried out shortly before a Parliamentary Review of Canada's Anti-terrorism Act. Another issue raised in the film is the history of scandals surrounding the RCMP and previous dirty trick tactics, as well as their previous unsuccessful attempts to arrest large groups of Canadians under the guise of combating terrorism. The film examines the sensational media-coverage of the \\"Toronto 18\\", and strongly criticizes the roles and motivations of two informants involved in the case.  The informants  One police informant who assisted in the arrests is Mubin Shaikh. Shaikh was reportedly in charge of accompanying some of the accused on a camping trip, where they played paint-ball in a forest north of Toronto. Shaikh has contradicted his claims that this camping trip was a terrorist training camp. The other informant is in witness protection. In 2006, he was identified as an Egyptian in his 20s, with a degree in agricultural engineering. According to the CBC, \\"the young mole's degree in agricultural engineering could have given the alleged conspirators access to much larger quantities of ammonium nitrate than they could have purchased at ordinary retail outlets.\\" Some critics say this fact could foreshadow the use of entrapment as a defense, since the informants actions facilitated the purchase of bomb-making materials that the suspects would have been otherwise unable to acquire. However, the courts found that both agents did not entrap the suspects.  Other controversies  Unfair Dealing raises the issue of abuse in the prisons where the remaining \\"Toronto 18\\" suspects are being held. The film points to the fact that some suspects have been in solitary confinement for almost two years, which is considered by some to be a form of cruel and unusual punishment. Another issue raised in the film is treatment of the prisoners, specifically Steven Vikash Chand, who the CBC reports was allegedly hit on the face, \\"then dragged... naked along a hallway by his hair and (thrown) into a bare cell smeared with feces and smelling of urine.\\" Unfair Dealing also casts suspicion on the proximity of an RCMP detachment to a warehouse where the suspects allegedly had bomb-making materials delivered, which is within 800 meters of the Toronto North RCMP Detachment in Newmarket, Ontario.  Accuracy  Since the release of Unfair Dealing, several claims in the film have been proven true through court proceedings. The informant Mubin Shaikh has admitted that the attendees of an alleged terrorist training camp North of Toronto were actually unaware of any terrorist plans to attack Canada, as is alleged in the documentary. It has also been revealed through court proceedings that Shaikh purchased a rifle and ammunition for some of the accused at the behest of Zakaria Amara, and instructed some of them on how to use a handgun that was present during a winter camping trip at the instruction of Faheem Ahmad. The film‚Äôs portrayal of informant Shaher Elsohemy as a financially motivated informant, whose participation was integral to the success of the bomb-plot, has also proven accurate. Notes from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service have confirmed that Elsohemy was motivated out of ‚Äúmoney‚Äù and ‚Äúspite‚Äù, citing an attempt by Elsohemy to defraud a previous employer for disability benefits. Court has also heard that Elsohemy was hired for the explicit purposes of enticing the suspects with his credentials in agricultural engineering, facilitating the purchase of bomb-ingredients, and providing a warehouse for the storage of bomb-making materials, confirming previous reports focused on in the documentary.

The Burau representation has two common and near- equivalent formulations, the reduced and unreduced Burau representations.  Definition  The covering space may be thought of concretely as follows: cut the disk along lines from the boundary to the marked points. Take as many copies of the result as there are integers, stack them vertically, and connect them by ramps going from one side of the cut on one level to the other side of the cut on the level below. This procedure is shown here for ; the covering transformations act by shifting the space vertically. Consider the braid group to be the mapping class group of a disc with marked points . The homology group is free abelian of rank . Moreover, the invariant subspace of (under the action of ) is primitive and infinite cyclic. Let be the projection onto this invariant subspace. Then there is a covering space corresponding to this projection map. Much like in the construction of the Alexander polynomial, consider as a module over the group-ring of covering transformations , which is isomorphic to the ring of Laurent polynomials . As a -module, is free of rank . By the basic theory of covering spaces, acts on , and this representation is called the reduced Burau representation. The unreduced Burau representation has a similar definition, namely one replaces with its (real, oriented) blow-up at the marked points. Then instead of considering one considers the relative homology where is the part of the boundary of corresponding to the blow-up operation together with one point on the disc's boundary. denotes the lift of to . As a -module this is free of rank . By the homology long exact sequence of a pair, the Burau representations fit into a short exact sequence : where (resp. ) is the reduced (resp. unreduced) Burau -module and is the complement to the diagonal subspace, in other words: :D = left { left (x_1,cdots,x_n right ) in mathbf{Z}^n : x_1+cdots+x_n=0 right }, and acts on by the permutation representation.  Explicit matrices  Let denote the standard generators of the braid group . Then the unreduced Burau representation may be given explicitly by mapping :sigma_i mapsto left( begin{array}{cccc} I_{i-1} & 0 & 0 & 0  hline 0 & 1-t & t & 0  0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline 0 & 0 & 0 & I_{n-i-1} \\\\end{array} \\\\right), for , where denotes the identity matrix. Likewise, for the reduced Burau representation is given by :\\\\sigma_1 \\\\mapsto \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{ccc}-t & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline 0 & 0 & I_{n-3} \\\\end{array} \\\\right), :\\\\sigma_i \\\\mapsto \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{ccccc} I_{i-2} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & t & -t & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & I_{n-i-2} \\\\end{array} \\\\right), \\\\quad 2 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n-2, :\\\\sigma_{n-1} \\\\mapsto \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{ccc} I_{n-3} & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & t & -t \\\\end{array} \\\\right), while for , it maps :\\\\sigma_1 \\\\mapsto \\\\left( -t \\\\right).  Bowling alley interpretation  Vaughan Jones gave the following interpretation of the unreduced Burau representation of positive braids for in - i.e. for braids that are words in the standard braid group generators containing no inverses - which follows immediately from the above explicit description: Given a positive braid on strands, interpret it as a bowling alley with intertwining lanes. Now throw a bowling ball down one of the lanes and assume that at every crossing where its path crosses over another lane, it falls down with probability and continues along the lower lane. Then the 'th entry of the unreduced Burau representation of is the probability that a ball thrown into the 'th lane ends up in the 'th lane.  Relation to the Alexander polynomial  If a knot is the closure of a braid in , then, up to multiplication by a unit in , the Alexander polynomial of is given by :\\\\frac{1-t}{1-t^n} \\\\det(I-f_*), where is the reduced Burau representation of the braid . For example, if in , one finds by using the explicit matrices above that : \\\\frac{1-t}{1-t^n} \\\\det(I-f_*) = t, and the closure of is the unknot whose Alexander polynomial is .  Faithfulness  The first nonfaithful Burau representations were found by John A. Moody without the use of computer, using a notion of winding number or contour integration. A more conceptual understanding, due to Darren D. Long and Mark Paton interprets the linking or winding as coming from Poincar√© duality in first homology relative to the basepoint of a covering space, and uses the intersection form (traditionally called Squier's Form as Craig Squier was the first to explore its properties). Stephen Bigelow combined computer techniques and the Long‚ÄìPaton theorem to show that the Burau representation is not faithful for .S. Bigelow,International Congress of Mathematicians, Beijing, 2002Vladimir Turaev, Faithful representations of the braid groups, Bourbaki 1999-2000 Bigelow moreover provides an explicit non-trivial element in the kernel as a word in the standard generators of the braid group: let :\\\\psi_1 = \\\\sigma_3^{-1}\\\\sigma_2 \\\\sigma_1^2 \\\\sigma_2 \\\\sigma_4^3 \\\\sigma_3 \\\\sigma_2, \\\\quad \\\\psi_2 = \\\\sigma_4^{-1} \\\\sigma_3 \\\\sigma_2 \\\\sigma_1^{-2} \\\\sigma_2 \\\\sigma_1^2 \\\\sigma_2^2 \\\\sigma_1 \\\\sigma_4^5. Then an element of the kernel is given by the commutator :[\\\\psi_1^{-1}\\\\sigma_4\\\\psi_1,\\\\psi_2^{-1}\\\\sigma_4\\\\sigma_3\\\\sigma_2\\\\sigma_1^2\\\\sigma_2\\\\sigma_3\\\\sigma_4\\\\psi_2]. The Burau representation for has been known to be faithful for some time. The faithfulness of the Burau representation when is an open problem. The Burau representation appears as a summand of the Jones representation, and for , the faithfulness of the Burau representation is equivalent to that of the Jones representation, which on the other hand is related to the question of whether or not the Jones polynomial is an unknot detector.  Geometry  Craig Squier showed that the Burau representation preserves a sesquilinear form. Moreover, when the variable is chosen to be a transcendental unit complex number near , it is a positive-definite Hermitian pairing. Thus the Burau representation of the braid group can be thought of as a map into the unitary group U(n).

Hence, Alias is similar to Taboo, but the only forbidden word in the explanations is the word to be explained. The game is played in teams of varying size, and fits well as a party game for larger crowds. The game is very competitive. Alias has been developed in Finland and is produced by Nelostuote Oy under the brand name Tactic. The game has been on the market since the early 1990s and is one of the most popular party games in Finland. Over the years, many different versions of the board game have appeared: As well as the New Alias, the Alias family currently also includes the Junior Alias for children, the Alias travel game, and as the newest introduction, DVD Alias. The name The name Alias comes from the word alias, meaning also known as. Basic Alias The board in Alias is a \\"path\\" consisting of sequential curving numbers on a red background. The game contains 8 numbered groups. The game is divided into turns of about one minute of length. The teams play in turns, and on each team's turn, one of the team members has to explain words on word cards to the other team members. The other team members take guesses at the word, and words that have been correctly guessed earn the team one point per word. Explanation mistakes (meaning the explainer uses the word to be explained, part of it, or a derivative of it), and words passed over without being guessed take points away. The players move on the board as many places as they have earned points on their turn. If, for example, the team lands on the number 7, the word to be explained from the cards is word number 7. The first team to reach the goal wins. The game is recommended for players over 7 years. New Alias The New Alias is a version of Alias, where the words are divided into 8 classes: 1. Things and Concepts, 2. People and Professions, 3. Adjectives, 4. Verbs. The numbered classes can include anything whatsoever. The game board's base colour is red and the squares of each category are played in turns. Special Alias On the flip side of the New Alias board is the Special Alias version of the board game: the rules are otherwise the same as in New Alias, but the game has different classes: The world around us, Sports and exercise, Entertainment and culture, and Sayings and quotes. The classes Entertainment and culture and Sayings and quotes have special explanations, meaning that the first card contains a hint related to the word, and in the second card, the word to be explained is part of a saying or quote and the word to be explained is replaced, for example, with the word \\"beep\\". Both classes also contain normal explanations. Junior Alias Junior Alias is otherwise like the normal Alias, except there are also pictures to be explained and the words have been chosen to fit for children. The red colour of the board has been replaced with yellow, and the appearance is more child- friendly. This game is recommended for players over 5 years. DVD Alias The DVD version of Alias is hosted by Marco Bjurstr√∂m, and as well as word explanations, the game includes exercise. The game takes over an hour. A television and a DVD player are needed to play the DVD version of Alias.

Function Most jurisdictions levy a sales tax or a value added tax on commercial transactions such as sales in stores or food served in a restaurant. These transactions are now most often recorded by a POS system rather than a mechanical cash register. The POS system records are generally not alterable by the operator and are used as the basis of tax assessments and audits by tax authorities. Because POS systems are increasingly designed as general purpose computers (as of 2008, 85% worldwide were reported to run Microsoft Windows), arbitrary software can be run on them. A \\"zapper\\" is a software program, often run untraceable from a USB flash drive, that accesses the POS system records and allows the owner of a business to alter the records so as to make it credibly appear that fewer transactions have occurred than has actually been the case. This reduces the tax burden on the business, which is generally proportional to the volume of the transactions. Government responses The use of zappers is illegal and may be subject to criminal penalties. However, according to a 2008 The New York Times report, governments worldwide have yet to find effective means of preventing their use. A European Union committee on cash register fraud has been established, and legislation mandating tamper-proof POS systems has been proposed in Germany in 2008 (INSIKA) and introduced in Quebec, Canada, on September 1, 2010. In Canada, legislation aimed at suppressing zappers is in effect since 1 January 2014. A first offence will lead to a $5,000 fine, and subsequent infractions to a $50,000 fine. Persons in possession of zappers could be fined up to $50,000, and developers or sellers up to $100,000. In Australia, activities involving electronic sales suppression tools that relate to people or businesses that have Australian tax obligations are banned since 4 October 2018, and subject to criminal and administrative penalties.

The project‚Äôs creator is Lars Bak. The first version of the V8 engine was released at the same time as the first version of Chrome: 2 September 2008. It has also been used on the server side, for example in Couchbase, MongoDB and Node.js. History The V8 assembler is based on the Strongtalk assembler. On 7 December 2010, a new compiling infrastructure named Crankshaft was released, with speed improvements. Since version 41 of Chrome in 2015, project TurboFan has been added to enable more speed, e.g. for asm.js. In 2016, the Ignition interpreter was added to V8 with the design goal of reducing the memory usage on small memory Android phones in comparison with TurboFan and Crankshaft. In 2017, V8 shipped a brand-new compiler pipeline, consisting of Ignition (the interpreter) and TurboFan (the optimizing compiler). Starting with V8 version 5.9, Full-codegen and Crankshaft are no longer used in V8 for JavaScript execution, since the team believes they are no longer able to keep pace with new JavaScript language features and the optimizations those features require. Design V8 first generates an abstract syntax tree with its own parser. Then, Ignition, the V8 interpreter, generates bytecode from this syntax tree using the internal V8 bytecode format. TurboFan is the V8 optimizing compiler, it takes this bytecode and generates machine code from it. In other words, V8 compiles JavaScript directly to native machine code using just-in-time compilation before executing it. The compiled code is additionally optimized (and re- optimized) dynamically at runtime, based on heuristics of the code's execution profile. Optimization techniques used include inlining, elision of expensive runtime properties, and inline caching. The garbage collector is a generational incremental collector. Usage V8 can compile to x86, ARM or MIPS instruction set architectures in both their 32- and 64-bit editions; as well, it has been ported to PowerPC and IBM s390 for use in servers.

A right-handed opening batsman, noted for his prolific run scoring and ability to build large innings, Bhave regularly captained Maharashtra throughout the 1990s. Bhave had a strong start to his career, after making just one first- class appearance in both 1986/87 and 1987/88 he made the most of his opportunity in 1988/89 by scoring 730 runs at 91.25.

He would score a further six double hundreds in his career, three of them in 1992. Such was his consistency that it wasn't until 1997/98 that he ended a season with an average under 50 and he never scored less than 800 runs from 1992/93 to 1996/97. Although Maharashtra never won the Ranji Trophy while Bhave was at the club, he did captain them to the final in 1992/93.

He also provided valuable information to Rashid-al-Din Hamadani to write about the Mongols. Mongolists consider him as a cultural bridge between East and West. Biography Bolad was born in the D√∂rben tribe (possibly D√∂rbet) family and his father, Jurghi (Yurki), who was a steward, attached to the palace of Genghis Khan's wife B√∂rte. Since his father's title was prestige of honor, and he was explicitly trusted by Genghis Khan, Jurghi commanded a personal thousand of the guards of the Khagan. In 1248, the prince Khubilai ordered the Chinese scholar, Chang te-hui, to tutor his eldest son, Dorji, and Bolad who was probably a child of seven or eight years, and Bolad became fluent in Chinese in addition to his native Mongolian language. After Khubilai‚Äôs election as Khagan in 1260, Bolad served as ba‚Äôurchi, designer of court ritual, censor, and chief of the agricultural administration (in Mongolian style). In addition, he did oral and written translations for the state affairs as one of intellectuals of the Mongols. Bolad also served as judge in the sensitive cases of Ariq B√∂ke (1264) and the murder of Ahmad Fanakati (1282). Bolad found the fraud activities of the latter and informed the Khagan. He was sent to the Ilkhanate in Persia soon after Arghun enthroned in 1285. He gave imperial seal, jarlig (–∑–∞—Ä–ª–∏–≥) and crown to the new Ilkhan. Bolad could not return to the Yuan Dynasty due to the conflicts between the Yuan and the Chagatai Khanate headed by Kaidu. Arghun appointed him a commander of his kheshig and assigned him of certain tasks in Khurasan. Although he had a family (his wife and two sons) left in Mongolia, Bolad was given a former concubine of Abaqa Khan, thus starting a new life in the Middle East. His sons served the Yuan government. Facing difficulties to finance the coffers of the empty imperial treasury, Gaykhatu, summoned Bolad to advise him about the use of paper money then circulating in the Yuan. After taking consultation, the Ilkhan's court issued jiaochao in Iran in 1294. Although it proved to be a failure owing to the resistance of local population, this was the first time, the paper money was issued in the history of Iran. The Muslim convert Ghazan became the new Ilkhan in 1295. Although, his reputation may have been little diminished during Ghazan's reign, Ghazan respected Bolad. Seeing Mongol commoners selling their children as damaging the Mongol nation, similar to Khubilai, Ghazan budgeted funds to redeem Mongol slaves and made Bolad the commander of the tumen which consisted of Mongol slave boys. It is claimed that Bolad assisted Rashid-al-Din Hamadani to write Universal History because he knew Mongolian history very well. Under √ñljeit√º (1304‚Äì16), Bolad achieved great influence as chingsang (chengxiang, grand councillor) and agha (Classic Mongolian: aqa, meaning elder). He was along with Chupan of the Suldus, and Kutlushah of the Qonkhoton served the Ilkhan as main advisors. He was responsible for logistical support system during the Gilan campaign in 1307. In 1311 Bolad was awarded the title of the Duke of State of Tse by Ayurbarwada Khan of the Yuan. Bolad died in 1313. Long after his death, the Yuan government posthumously awarded him an honorary title.

Already as a boy, he learned some of the other languages traditionally spoken in the town, German, Friulian, Slovene and Venetian. An autodidact, he published his first important work on the languages of the Orient in 1854. In 1860, he was appointed professor of linguistics at the Accademia scientifico-letteraria in Milan and introduced the study of comparative philology, Romance studies, and Sanskrit. He made an important contribution to the study of the relationship between Indo-European and Semitic languages and was a pioneer in the fields of Romani language and Celtic languages. In Italy, he is above all known for his studies of Italian dialects, which he was first to classify systematically. On the Italian language question (questione della lingua), he did not accept a standard language, based upon the Florentine dialect as proposed by Alessandro Manzoni, but argued for a leveling of the dialects. He was the founder of the so-called substratum theory, which explains instances of formation and development of languages as a result of interference with previous languages spoken by the populations in question. in 1889 Ascoli was appointed a member of the Senate of the Kingdom of Italy. He was awarded many honorary orders, among which the Prussian/German \\"Pour le M√©rite\\" and the Italian \\"Ordine civile di Savoia\\" and \\"Ordine dei SS. Maurizio e Lazzaro\\"; he was also a member of many scientific academies, such as the Accademia dei Lincei (since 1875) and the Accademia della Crusca (since 1895)Members of the Senate of the Kingdom of Italy. Political views  Ascoli considered himself foremost a Friulian of Jewish religion but was also an Italian patriot. One of his most lasting and politically most influential contributions was the coinage of the geographical term Venezia Giulia to denote what was hitherto known as the Austrian Littoral. Ascoli suggested that northeast Italy was composed by three historically, geographically, and culturally interconnected regions, which he called the Three Venices. According to his classification, these three historical-geographical regions were: *Euganean Venetia (Venezia Euganea), consisting of the Venetia region properly speaking (the current region of Veneto and Friuli); *Tridentine Venetia (Venezia Tridentina), that is that part of the County of Tyrol that lies south of the Brenner Pass (corresponding to the current Italian region of Trentino-Alto Adige); *Julian Venetia (Venezia Giulia), which was the area of the Austrian Littoral, plus the Hungarian port of Rijeka (Fiume). Ascoli coined these names following the internal divisions in the province ofItaly during ancient Roman rule, and applied them to the 19th century. His geographical redefinition had a strong political implication: it was aimed at showing that the peripheral areas of the Austrian Empire were in fact gravitating towards Italy. His denomination was soon taken over by Italian irredentists who sought the annexation of the Trentino, the Austrian Littoral, Fiume and Dalmatia to Italy. In World War I, the terms Venezia Giulia and Venezia Tridentina became the official names for the new territories acquired by Italy from Austria-Hungary with the treaties of Saint Germain and Rapallo. The Kingdom of Italy used Ascoli's terms to replace the previous traditional denominations, Tyrol and Austrian Littoral. The former term fell into disuse after the fall of the Fascist regime. The latter, however, still exists in the name of the Italian region Friuli-Venezia Giulia. The term \\"Venezia Euganea,\\" on the other hand, never gained any significant support, although it was sporadically used during the Fascist period. Bibliography Works published in Italian: * G.I.

Overview The Second and Third Editions of the Lithuanian Chronicle relate that Giedrius (Palemonids), a brother of Grand Duke Traidenis of Lithuania (late 13th century), built a castle, named it Giedraiƒçiai, and adopted the title Prince of Giedraiƒçiai. A document issued by Grand Duke Vytautas of Lithuania in the period 1399‚Äì1429 settled a dispute between the Bishop of Vilnius and the Princes of Giedraiƒçiai. Numerous members of the family were recorded in the 15th and 16th centuries, and thereafter, with the title Prince. The two lines of the family for which coherent genealogies are available (the family's \\"central core\\") descend from (i) Prince Aleksander (late 15th century) and (ii) Prince Bart≈Çomiej (died in 1524). The 1569 Act of Union inaugurating the Polish-Lithuanian Royal Commonwealth confirmed that, as previously in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Lithuanian families of dynastic origin remained entitled to use the title Prince. Many subsequent Giedroyƒá family members, both of the Line of Aleksander and of the Line of Bart≈Çomiej, were recorded with the title Prince ‚Äì including several (of both Lines) whose right to the title was individually confirmed under Imperial Russian legislation of 1832. Other members did not seek such specific confirmation under the Russian Empire, but relied on confirmation of their noble status and princely origins under Russian legislation of 1801/3. The Imperial Russian heraldic authority classified these as \\"of the Princes\\". Under the usage of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, as confirmed by the 1569 Act of Union, princely origins in themselves establish princely status. Armorial bearings The Second Edition of the Lithuanian Chronicle records that a centaur was the armorial charge of the forebears of Giedrus. A decree issued in 1401 by W≈Çadis≈Çaw Jagiello, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, confirms the right of Prince Micha≈Ç Giedroyƒá vel. Ratybor (baptized c.1387) to the arms Hippocentaurus \\"as used by his illustrious grandfather\\" Ginwill (2nd Duke of Giedrojcie and candidate to the grand ducal office of Lithuania). But the earliest surviving illustrated Giedroyƒá armorial charge is a rose, on seals attached to state documents of 1431-4. Through the 17th and 18th centuries, the centaur was used predominantly by most members of the family, sometimes in combination with the rose; while the descendants of Miko≈Çaj (died 1657, sixth generation in the Line of Bart≈Çomiej) continued to use the rose alone. But the centaur (sometimes with the rose, sometimes without) predominates in all the 19th century Russian records, even for the descendants of Miko≈Çaj. At the English College of Arms, the arms of Michal Giedroyc (born 1929, 16th generation in the Line of Bart≈Çomiej) include both the rose and the centaur (called a sagittary in English heraldry) blazoned as follows: Per fess Or and Gules in chief a Rose Gules barbed and seeded proper and in base a Sagittary trippant to the dexter the head facing to the sinister his tail a serpent facing to the dexter holding in the hands a Bow with arrow drawn and set towards the head of the serpent all Or.

It was acquired by Boyd Gaming in 2016.  History  Cannery Casino Resorts was an outgrowth of Millennium Management Group, a casino management company. Millennium was founded in 1996 by two long-time gaming executives, Bill Paulos and Bill Wortman. Millennium's first venture, in 1997, was to join a consortium competing for a license to develop a casino in Detroit, the proposed Greektown Casino Hotel. The Greektown casino opened in 2000 under Millennium's management. Cannery Casino Resorts was created in 2001 by Millennium to develop the Cannery Casino and Hotel in North Las Vegas. In 2002, Millennium assumed management of the casino at the JW Marriott Las Vegas under a ten-year lease agreement and rebranded it as the Rampart Casino. Meanwhile, Millennium transitioned to a consulting role at Greektown, as the casino's owners took over management. The Cannery opened in 2003 at a cost of $105 million. In 2005, Oaktree Capital Management agreed to buy 33 percent of Cannery Casino Resorts. With the funds injected, Wortman was able to buy out two minority partners in the Nevada Palace casino, which was placed under the Cannery umbrella. Wortman bought a 20 percent stake in the Rockingham Park racetrack in New Hampshire in 2005, and Cannery obtained an option to buy the park outright. The company led an unsuccessful lobbying effort to legalize casinos in New Hampshire, and proposed a $450 million expansion of the park with up to 5,000 slot machines. Oaktree funding also enabled CCR to buy The Meadows, a harness racetrack near Pittsburgh, in November 2006 from Magna Entertainment for $200 million.

It was a two-seat machine intended to demonstrate the feasibility of a twin-rotor system, and while it accomplished this, it also demonstrated a number of problems that prevented further development of this particular design. Design and development The successful demonstration of the Sikorsky VS-300 had the USAAF favoring the helicopter over the autogiro as an approach to rotary-winged flight. Realizing this, the Kellett Autogiro Corporation made a proposal to the USAAF on 11 November 1942 for the development of a twin-rotor helicopter that would eliminate the need for a tail rotor and its attendant loss of power. Initially discounted on theoretical grounds, the proposal was re-examined in the light of tests done with models by the Army's Experimental Engineering Section, and was accepted on 7 January the following year. This was followed on 11 September with a contract for nearly $1,000,000 to build two prototypes with the three-bladed rotors contained in Kellett's proposal, along with an alternative two-bladed system. The resulting aircraft had a stubby, egg-shaped fuselage with a single tail-fin and tricycle undercarriage. Two seats were enclosed side-by-side behind an extensively-glazed nose and the two rotors intermeshed with one another, offset by 12¬Ω¬∞. The fuselage construction was of steel-tube, skinned in sheet metal and fabric, and the rotor blades were built of plywood ribs and skin attached to steel tubes. The intermeshing rotors quickly earned it the nickname \\"eggbeater\\". Operational history The first flight took place on 7 August 1944 with Kellett chief test pilot Dave Driscoll at the controls. A lack of directional stability was discovered, and was corrected by the addition of two extra tail fins. A far more serious problem was discovered on 7 September, when it was found that a blade from each rotor had collided while the aircraft was in flight. The Air Force therefore ordered Kellett to design a new, rigid rotor system for the XR-8. In the meantime, the two-bladed rotor system was trialled on the second prototype, beginning in March 1945. This proved immediately unworkable, with severe vibration that was prohibitively difficult to resolve. Similarly, it became apparent that the rigid rotor system was going to require extensive redesign of the aircraft, and this effort was dropped as well. On 23 January 1946, the XR-8 was accepted for service trials with its original, non-rigid rotors in place. However, the program was canceled almost immediately, and the prototype was eventually handed over to the National Air and Space Museum where it remains in 2008.

Soon afterward he sent out messengers to the local Aillarehues to come and submit to the Spanish. Turcupichun gathered them in a great coyag where he advocated resistance to the death and elected him as their toqui replacing the dead Lautaro.This according to Diego de Rosales, ‚ÄúHistoria General del Reino de Chile‚Äù, Flandes Indiano, Tomo II, Capitulo XII. This would seem to imply that Lautaro was also the toqui of the Butalmapu of the Moluche north of the Bio Bio River, as Ainavillo had been before him. Turcupichun led his army to build a pucara on the height of Andalic√°n five leagues south of Concepcion covering the approach down the coast to Arauco and posted detachments to cover the crossing points on the Bio Bio River. Governor Mendoza deceived him by having a detachment build rafts at one of these crossing points but using the boats of his fleet to carry his army across at the mouth of the river. Turcupichun then engaged and was defeated by the army of Mendoza in the Battle of Lagunillas.Rosales, Historia general ..., Tomo II,Capitulo XIII] Following this defeat his army fell back and joined with Caupolic√°n to fight in the Battle of Millarapue. Following the battle Turcupichun was blamed by Caupolican, for the defeat when his third division marching to attack the Spanish rear did not arrive in time. Angry at the accusation he withdrew to defend his own lands.Rosales, Historia general ..., Tomo II,Capitulo XIV.] Following the execution of Caupolican, Turcupichun attempted to organize a new revolt and an attack on Concepcion, but the Spanish Corregidor of the city, Ger√≥nimo de Villegas discovered his attempt and sent Juan Galiano with some soldiers to attack him first. Moving to where he was lodged at night Galiano captured him and some of his companions and returned with them to the city where he was hung in the plaza.

Plot  Paw Hee-Ching and Leung Chun-lung play a mother and son who live in Tin Shui Wai New Town. Paw works in the local supermarket while Leung is a Form 5 student who is waiting for his HKCEE results during summer holiday. Paw meets Chan Lai-wun as she is hired at the supermarket, and begins to help her out. Chan wants to buy a television set but is discouraged by the delivery fee. Paw asks Leung to come to the electrical store to help carry it to Chan's flat, saving her the transport fee. Chan returns the favour by giving Paw a bag of expensive Chinese mushrooms. Paw's mother falls sick and Leung visits her in the hospital with his cousin. Their grandmother demands swallow's nest congee. Through her deceased daughter, Chan has a grandson who lives with her son-in-law, who has since remarried. Chan purchases gifts for them and goes with Paw to meet them in Shatin, but her grandson does not show up and her gifts are rejected by her son-in-law. She gives them to Paw instead, who agrees to safeguard them for the time being. While running an errand for his mother Leung runs into his school teacher (Idy Chan). She invites him to help out at the school as a student counsellor when he returns for Form 6 and he duly agrees. Paw's two younger brothers are doing well in life, thanks to Paw's financial support during their university years overseas. One of them, played by Clifton Ko, talks to Leung and promises he and his younger brother will support him financially to study overseas if he so desires. He replies that he will decide after seeing his HKCEE results. At the end of the movie, Paw, Leung and Chan are seen happily having dinner together in Tin Shui Wai as Leung has received satisfactory results in his exam and can continue on to Form 6.

SH 71 can be accessed via offramps coming off SH 1 (as the Christchurch Northern Motorway). Smith Street, coming from Kaiapoi, also flows onto SH 71. Initially a northbound only exit, southbound access was provided in 2014. Just south of Rangiora the road crosses the railway line at-grade.

It grows over open dry meadows, grasslands, and rocks. In Serbia, this plant species contributes to several xerothermous grass formations which develop on warm, dry silicate terrains at altitude above , mostly over plains or mild slopes, on acidic soils derived from crystalline albite-muscovite schist and gneiss-like granite. In southern Banat (Serbia), the dried herb is used to make tasty and refreshing herbal tea drinks, owing to its peculiar and pleasant lemon-like scent. Fresh leaves are used for aromatisation of homemade jams, candies and similar confections. Traditionally, it is used also for coughs and other respiratory complaints, as well as certain gastrointestinal disorders.  Chemical composition  According to Karuza-Stojakoviƒá et al., the principal constituents of T. pannonicus essential oil from southern parts of Vojvodina province (northern Serbia) were terpinyl acetate, terpinen-4-ol, thymol, carvacrol, and geranyl acetate (listed in order of descending quantity).Ljiljana Karuza-Stojakoviƒá, Stamenko Pavloviƒá, Predrag ≈Ωivanoviƒá, Branka Todoroviƒá.

J. Hort. Sci., 2007, 13, 79-82 Further research efforts of Pluh√°r Zs. et al. on the volatile oil composition of T. pannonicus from nineteen different localities of Hungary, confirmed a significant essential oil polymorphism in this plant species, as twelve different chemovarieties were determined, namely: thymol, thymol/p-cymene, thymol/p-cymene/Œ≥-terpinene, thymol/p-cymene/neral, thymol/p-cymene/Œ≥-terpinene/Œ≤-bisabolene, thymol/p-cymene/isoborneol/Œ≥-terpinene, thymol/linalyl acetate/Œ≥-terpinene/Œ±-cubebene, p-cymene/geraniol/linalyl acetate, linalyl acetate/geranyl acetate, germacrene D/Œ≤-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide/Œ±-cubebene/linalool, and germacrene D/Œ≤-caryophyllene/farnesol. On the other hand, a T. pannonicus population, which is located over the southern slopes of Vr≈°ac Mountains in southern Banat (Vojvodina province, Serbia) was characterised by exceptionally high percentage of oxygenated monoterpenes (91.75%). The most abundant components of its essential oil were identified as geranial (41.42%, w/w) and neral (29.61%, w/w), the mixture of which is frequently referred to as citral.  Biological activity  The antimicrobial activity of essential oil was evaluated using the agar disc diffusion and broth microdilution methods against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, two strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and two strains of Candida albicans. The essential oil exhibited in vitro antimicrobial activity to varying degrees against all tested strains. The maximum activity of T. pannonicus oil was observed against E. coli, S. aureus and both tested strains of C. albicans (MIC = 50 Œºl/ml, each). Moderate activity was observed against P. aeruginosa and one of the tested strains of K. pneumoniae (MIC = 200 Œºl/ml), while E. faecalis and the other strain of K. pneumoniae expressed a higher degree of resistance (MIC > 200 Œºl/ml)) References pannonicus Flora of Europe Flora of Russia Plants described in 1785 Taxa named by Carlo Allioni ","title":"Thymus pannonicus"},{"id":"19141528","text":"H7, H07 or H-7 may refer to : * H7 Chaffron Way, a road part of the Milton Keynes grid road system * British NVC community H7, a heath communities in the British National Vegetation Classification system * DSC-H7, a 2007 Sony Cyber- shot H series camera * Halloween H20, the seventh installment in the Halloween series. * Highway H07 (Ukraine), a road in Ukraine * HMS H7, a 1915 British H class submarine * HMS Defender (H07), a 1932 D class destroyer of the British Royal Navy * Influenza A virus subtype H7 (disambiguation), all virus containing the H7 type agglutinin * USS H-7 (SS-150), a 1918 United States Navy H class submarine * H07, Highland-Winet Airport FAA code * H7 (monogram), monogram of Haakon VII of Norway and Norwegian World War II resistance symbol * H7 (lamp), an automotive halogen lamp * H7 stud, a show jumper sporthorse breeding initiative ","title":"H7"},{"id":"19141570","text":"Village at Sandhill is a lifestyle center located in the northeast area of Columbia, South Carolina.

His role as Rawbone in their production of James Shirley's The Wedding shows that he was a thin-man clown, what his own era called a \\"lean fool,\\" like John Sinklo or John Shank. Robbins also played Carazie the eunuch in Philip Massinger's The Renegado, Clem in Thomas Heywood's The Fair Maid of the West, and the title character, the \\"changeling\\" Antonio, in Middleton and Rowley's The Changeling. The Queen Henrietta's company was disrupted by a long theatre closure due to bubonic plague in 1636-37\\\\. Robbins may have been one of the members of the troupe who travelled to Ireland with James Shirley to work at the Werburgh Street Theatre in Dublin in the later 1630s.Allan H. Stevenson, \\"James Shirley and the Actors at the First Irish Theatre,\\" Modern Philology, Vol. 40 No. 2 (November 1942), pp. 147-60. Robbins finished his acting career with a couple of years with the King's Men. He was made a Groom of the Chamber in January 1641, along with five other actors in the troupe.Andrew Gurr, The Shakespeare Company, 1594-1642, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004; p. 238. After the theatres closed in 1642, Robbins, like some other actors (fellow King's Men Charles Hart and Nicholas Burt are good examples), fought on the Royalist side during the English Civil War. Robbins attained the rank of captain before dying during the siege of Basing House in October 1645. James Wright, in his Historia Histrionica (1699), maintains that Robbins was shot in the head after surrendering, by a soldier in the Commonwealth forces (the soldier reportedly was Thomas Harrison, who later became a general in the Commonwealth army.)Dale B. J. Randall, Winter Fruit: English Drama 1642-1660, Lexington, KY, University Press of Kentucky, 1995; pp. 84 n. 17.Harrison answered Robbins plea for quarter with a quote from the bible: \\"Cursed be he that doeth the work of the Lord negligently, and keepeth back his sword from blood!\\" (Jeremiah 48:10) before killing him (Isaac Disraeli,1824, A second series of Curiosities of literature: consisting of ..., Volume 3 - Page 439). Family Robbins was married to Cicely Sands Brown Robbins, sister of King's Man James Sands and widow of actor Robert Browne.

It is a persistent-universe, open-ended game with a player-driven economy. Players travel through hundreds of \\"sectors\\" or solar systems while trading, building or battling with Non-Player Characters (NPCs) and other players. There are dozens of spacecraft models in Pardus, which can be customized with different weapons, armor and other equipment. Pardus characters do not have a defined 'class'. Partially inspired by classic computer games such as Elite and Master of Orion II, Pardus was developed and published by the Austrian company Bayer&Szell; OG. Alpha testing of the game began September 2004 and the core feature set was finished by October 1, 2006.http://www.pardus.at/index.php?section=archive&show;=44  Background  The main navigation screen.Pardus is set in a technologically advanced but war-torn universe. Players begin the game with a low-end spacecraft and attempt to increase their wealth, rank, skills and otherwise advance their characters. Players may optionally join factions and syndicates for rank-based rewards, or they may choose to build their wealth by developing trade routes or constructing buildings or starbases that produce commodities. Some players make a living smuggling contraband goods or pirating and raiding other players and their buildings, or bounty hunting. In the Pardus Cluster a NPC faction, the Lucidi, rule supreme. There are three different servers, or \\"universes\\", on which a player may create characters, one character per universe. One of these servers is reserved for Premium subscribers. Using more than one account by a player is forbidden, a rule which is strictly enforced.  Races  Upon completion of the tutorial a player must choose from one of four races: Humans, Rashkir, Ska'ari or Keldon. Each race has a specialization bonus of skills, ship and/or equipment, as well as a starting location appropriate to their species.  Factions  Factions are an important part of the game. There are three factions in the Pardus universe: the Empire, the Federation, and the Union. Each faction has a certain set of specializations, which gives member pilots access to unique ships and equipment. The two original factions and their ranks are heavily influenced by the Elite video game. *Empire :The Empire is one of the two ancestral factions consisting of mostly Ska'ari and Keldon. The first faction to exist, the Empire is wealthy and powerful. The Empire specializes in gun and missile based weapon systems. Its guns are more advanced than other conventional weapon types, and its missiles outshoot and outthink all others in the universe. The Empire controls the southern part of the Pardus universe, as well has six sectors in the Pardus Cluster. The Empire's rank structure has the feel of a feudal monarchy. *Federation :The Federation is the other of the two ancestral factions consisting largely of Humans and Rashkir. The second faction to come into existence, the Federation slowly formed as pilots looked to fight the Empire. The Federation specializes in ship construction and ship drives. Most Federation ships and drives have some design advantages over their neutral and other-faction counterparts. The Federation also has a faction specialist, the missile technician, who boosts the intelligence of its captain's missiles. The federation controls the region of space in the north-west part of the Pardus universe, as well as seven sectors in the Pardus Cluster. The Federation's rank structure has the feel of a regimented military system. *Union :The Union is the newest faction consisting of mainly Keldon and Rashkir. During its initial development, many former Empire and Federation pilots left to tap this new territory. The Union was formed by \\"Mad\\" Max Sheppard who was a trader ‚Äì selling arms to both the Federation and the Empire during the Second Great War. The Union's original aim was to extend the fighting between the Federation and the Empire in order to profit by selling arms to both factions. The Union is now well established as an independent faction. The Union specializes in shields, armor and illegal special equipment such as advanced countermeasures. The Union controls the north-eastern part of the Pardus universe, including seven sectors in the Pardus Cluster. The Union rank structure has the feel of an organized crime family. Each faction controls clusters and a smaller Pardus contingent cluster. There are also many neutral (officially) clusters throughout the universe, many of which serve as buffer areas between faction clusters. However, a starbase build by a player belonging to a faction exerts a certain amount of influence both economically and militarily. Players interactions are key to factions and is promoted by the game. Often on developed servers, cooperation within factions are highly organized. Decisions are often made by players of the biggest and/or most influential faction-affiliated alliances. The level of cooperation is such that on certain servers, the borders of some faction-controlled territory are sealed by military outposts (controlled by players) that prevent foes or unwanted guests from passing. This requires coordination of dozens of players, as the number of buildings each player can build is severely limited.  Syndicates  There are two Syndicates which generally represent opposed ends of the lawful/lawless spectrum. To join either syndicate, you must meet the reputation requirements of the syndicate. Syndicates are generally smaller than factions and do not claim territories. Each syndicate provides to its members access to unique ships and equipment, as well as daily reputation bonuses (positive or negative). *Esteemed Pilots Syndicate (EPS) :The Esteemed Pilots Syndicate is the syndicate of order and lawfulness, created as a response to the formation of TSS. Members can also be a member of any one faction, though the effect of reputation may kick the member from EPS during a war in which the pilot's faction is involved. EPS membership is public, with list of members accessible on every planet and EPS members' ships clearly marked. Ex-members may not join TSS while piloting an EPS ship. *The Shadow Syndicate (TSS) :The Shadow Syndicate is the syndicate of chaos and lawlessness, formed as the Union became an official and more lawful faction. TSS membership is secret, which means there is no definite way of identifying a TSS pilot and there is no list of members. TSS members may not join a faction, and ex-members may not join a faction or EPS while piloting a TSS ship.  Basic gameplay  Pardus is browser-based and requires no downloads to play. From the main interface Players have a view of the local system they are in, plus various screens detailing the buildings in the area, the contents of their ship, the skills of their character and so forth. All players must complete a tutorial before beginning the game. Though the main game is in English and using languages other than English for communication in open channels is forbidden, the tutorial is also available in Dutch, German, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Finnish, and Spanish. For the duration of the tutorial and a period of time after, a player has access to \\"Help Chat\\", in which experienced players make themselves available to assist newer players with problems or questions about the game. A critically important aspect of the game is the Action Point system. Any interaction with the game world requires Action Points (or APs) to be spent, which regenerate at a rate of 24 APs every 6 minutes throughout the day, up to a maximum of 5000 stored APs. This prevents players who stay in the game all day from gaining a significant advantage over people who only log in once or twice a day for a short time. There are certain skills and in-game items which grant a limited number of extra APs, and players with a Premium Account may accumulate up to 5500 APS instead of 5000. There are several ways to directly improve a player's character in the game. One of the most common ways is trading, which involves buying commodities and transporting them to another area where they can be sold for a higher price, often benefiting the area as a whole. Fighting NPCs improves a character's various combat attributes. Collecting raw resources improves collecting skills, and practicing hacking or cloaking enables a player to better perform those actions in the future.  Ships and equipment  There are dozens of ship models available in Pardus, but only one ship is used by a character at any one time. Each ship may be outfitted with various weapons, shields and other equipment. Ships and equipment available to a player depend on the player's faction or syndicate, faction rank, competency level and experience points. Ship and equipment choice depends on what the player intends to use it for, fighting, trading, or a mix of both.  Combat  Combat in Pardus is turn-based; the player chooses how many rounds to battle against an opponent. The number of hits and damage per hit each round is based on the combat skills and equipment of the character. Luck also plays an important role in combat. Some NPCs may hold a player for additional rounds of combat after a player tries to retreat. The chance of being held and the number of additional combat rounds depends on the type of NPC.  Economy  A variety of resources, NPCs and player buildings (Rigel, Pardus Empire Contingent).The economy in Pardus is dynamic and relies mostly on player actions. Several times each day at fixed intervals all planets, starbases and buildings in the game consume and produce a variety of commodities, provided certain upkeep needs are met. There are dozens of types of commodities available, ranging from low-tech raw materials such as Food, Water, Energy, Ore, and Metal, to high-end finished products such as Droids and Hand Weapons. Several illegal commodities, such as slaves, drugs, and body parts also exist. = Extracting raw materials = Raw materials can be harvested in space. Each tile, or \\"field\\", has a raw material associated with it; for example, open space contains hydrogen fuel, and asteroid fields contain ore. Each field holds a maximum of 500 units (tons) of its respective material. However, the more a field is harvested, the slower the field regenerates, and the less can be harvested from the field unless it is given sufficient time to regenerate. This often leads to fields that are \\"strip- mined\\", meaning raw materials are very scarce or in insufficient quantities to be harvested. Strip-mined fields are one of the most common difficulties encountered by players in the more populated areas of the universe. Also, players who strip-mine may find themselves an enemy of other pilots. = Constructing buildings = Players can construct a variety of buildings, in order to produce commodities associated with that building. Buildings produce and consume commodities every six hours, a process known as \\"ticking\\". The commodities consumed and produced in a building depend on the type of building. Improving building's Production Level increases the output, but also the efficiency of production. Players may stock their own buildings, or they may leave their buildings open to trade with other players; likewise, they may collect the produced goods themselves or leave those goods for sale for other players to consider purchasing. Buildings are classified as \\"Low-level\\" (including asteroid mines and fuel collectors), \\"Mid-level\\" (including Electronics Facilities and Breweries), and \\"High-level\\" (including Hand Weapons Factories and Military Outposts.) Each have their own initial start-up costs and their unique necessary upkeep, some high-end buildings require a certain amount of experience or APs played before construction is allowed. A few buildings, such as Drug Stations and Dark Domes, though lucrative, will cause the player reputation loss if built, with additional reputation losses if they are built in faction space. This reputation loss is often used by pirates to easily gain acceptance into The Shadow Syndicate and enjoy relevant benefits. Buildings can be raided by other players, which prompts owners to install building defenses to secure their business. These defense modules need to be destroyed before commodities can be stolen and allows the owner and his allies time to react to the attack. Undefended buildings can be damaged and eventually destroyed with subsequent attacks. Damaged buildings can be repaired by their owner. = Starbases = View of the inner starbase surrounded by players with bomber and fighter squadrons.Starbases are important trade centers in areas where no planets are to be found and are a very important part of the economy in Pardus. Player-owned starbases, though generally more difficult to maintain than other buildings, can make their owners a considerable amount of money if well placed. Some successful bases tend to have private web pages with extended customer services, marketing, RP elements and/or investor programs. An important function of starbases is providing players with a place to repair their vessels, provided the starbase owner builds a repair facility onto it. Starbases may also produce spacecraft and equipment, which the owner may then sell to other players. This is a very popular function, as player-built ships and equipment is usually considerably cheaper than their regular price offered by NPC starbases and planets. Unlike other buildings, starbases may be transferred to another player or conquered by force. Starbases also play a key role in faction wars, especially in the Pardus contingents. = Trading and missions = The basic method of obtaining wealth in Pardus is trading. Players buy goods from a planet, starbase or building, then travel to another to sell it in a \\"buy low-sell high\\" fashion. Many players establish trade routes between certain buildings which they maintain regularly. NPC starbases and planets have dynamic pricing which adjusts the commodity price according to the supply. Planets and starbases hold randomly generated missions that replenish as soon as they are completed by players. The bulletin boards offering these missions refresh two times a day. There is a variety of missions; for instance killing non-player characters (NPCs), delivering packages, or transporting VIPs. When a mission is completed successfully, the player receives a reward of credits (the in- game money); if the mission was a faction mission, the player will receive an amount of rank increase, or if the mission was a neutral (non-faction) mission, the player will receive an amount of \\"competency\\" instead. As competency level or faction rank increases, more difficult and rewarding missions will become available. There are also special faction missions available only during times of war. EPS members have 67% more neutral missions available to them than other pilots. = Raiding, piracy, bounty hunting and smuggling = A player does not have to be a legal trader, and can earn money through combat or illegal trade. With the proper equipment, a player may raid another player's spacecraft or building, a sometimes quite profitable exercise. Some players take pirating to an extreme and attempt to destroy anyone they can; these pirates often get bountied. A bounty can be placed on any player or building by the system or by other players. If a player kills a bountied player or destroys a bountied building, they will automatically receive the sum of all bounties that were placed on that particular individual or that building. Smuggling is a risky but often very profitable venture. Illegal commodities may be sold to other players or to the black market available on any planet or a starbase with a population over 30,000. There is a chance a player will be detected by the authorities when selling to a black market, however, which might result in a faction bounty. EPS pilots may have equipment that can detect illegal contraband on ships and will turn you over to authorities.  Player interaction  An important aspect of Pardus is interaction between players. Most players join a faction and one of the many player-made alliances, which range from just a few members to hundreds. Chat channels and forums are available for trading, alliance discussions, and other topics. Players often plan economies together in order to produce maximum profits, build Military Outpost \\"walls\\", and can attack or ambush targets together that they would not be able to defeat alone.  PvP combat  Player versus player (PvP) combat is frequent in Pardus. Like combat with an NPC, PvP combat is turn-based. Players may also set ambushes that are triggered by other players, even if the ambusher is offline. PvP combat is particularly intense during faction wars. Alliances can also declare a Private Conflict on each other. PvP killing not associated with faction war, private conflict, or bounty hunting is always considered piracy.  Alliances  There are also player-made alliances in Pardus; many alliances claim a section of space by building a blockade of military outposts (which are able to be equipped with defenses not available to other buildings). The players and their buildings behind the outposts are then safe from all but the most determined attackers. Alliances come in two versions, Veiled and Disclosed. *Disclosed :Disclosed alliances cannot accept TSS members. EPS members are only able to join alliances that are disclosed. Disclosed alliances may have a faction alignment, and if so, all members must be of that faction. *Veiled :Veiled alliances cannot accept EPS members. TSS members are only able to join alliances that are veiled. Veiled alliances may not have a faction alignment, in the same way that TSS members cannot be a member of a faction.  Premium subscriptions  Three spacecraft cautiously exploring the Pardus Sector.As of October 1, 2006, Pardus implemented premium subscriptions which give players access to new features and areas unavailable to non-paying players, plus a premium-only server. Available Premium periods are 30, 90, 180, and 360 days. A 10-day Premium trial is also offered to players free of charge once their character uses their 1 millionth AP. Premium subscriptions give access to three Pardus contingent clusters, with a total of 20 sectors, each owned by one of the factions, and the unique central Pardus sector. Contingent cluster sectors are providing benefits to players belonging to the owning faction. Unlike regular faction territory their ownership can change based on player activities. Only the central Pardus cluster, offering unique NPC opponents and additional rules, remains neutral at all times. Players may also get a free Premium subscription with the Pardus \\"referral program\\".  Awards  Pardus won the Best Free Online RPG award in the 2005 Online Game Awards held by GameOgre.  Social networking research  By collecting anonymous data from users Pardus has been used in social networking research, with particular attention to positive versus negative relationships with other players and how those relationships impact behavior and other interactions. Though certainly not unique in collecting electronic user data, Pardus is particularly useful for studying social interactions and complex networks due to the unusual depth of the social networking information collected in the game. Because Pardus is player-driven and open-ended, it acts similarly to agent-based models, with the important distinction of the \\"agents\\" being real people instead of programmed. By tracking how relationships, positive or negative, evolve and impact the Pardus society on micro and macro scales, researchers have been able to validate a long-standing social psychology theory known as social balance theory. Funding for the research includes the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and the Austrian Science Fund.

It is an Austro-Asiatic language that is a member of the Vietic language family. Specifically, it is a member of the Chut language group, which is one of the six Vietic languages. This language is considered severely endangered by UNESCO. Like other Vietic languages, the Arem language makes use of a tonal or phonational system that is unique to Vietic languages. Like many southern Vietic Languages, the Arem language also makes use of pre-syllables or sesquisyllables within the language. Arem lacks the breathy phonation common to most Vietic languages, but does have glottalized final consonants.  History and background  Arem is an ethnographic term to describe a group of indigenous people that reside on the border of Southern Vietnam and Laos. The people prefer to call themselves Cmbrau . However, because this is the only attested sesquisyllabic structure in the language, it is theorized that this may also be an ethnographic term that was borrowed from another nearby language. The Arem people were only known to exist by local populations of Vietnam until 1959, when they were discovered by the Vietnamese military.FERLUS, Michel. 2014. Arem, a Vietic Language.

Blair (born September 16, 1961) is an American serial killer who was convicted of killing seven women in Kansas City, Missouri, though investigators believe he may have additional unidentified victims. Family history Terry Blair was born into a family which would have many encounters with the criminal justice system. He was the fourth eldest of ten siblings, and was born to a mother who suffered from mental illness and had only finished the 9th grade. He has two sons, Terry Blair Jr and Marcel Johnson. He has two grandsons, Demarcus and Kemon Johnson. CourtTV news story Crimes Murder of Angela Monroe in 1982 In 1982, Blair was found guilty of killing Angela Monroe, the mother of two of Blair's children (and pregnant at the time). Blair was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment for this murder and was released on parole after serving 21 years. According to court records he was angry with Monroe for performing acts of prostitution. Murders 2003‚Äì2004 Alerted by a strong odor, a neighbor noticed two women's bodies in the garage of an abandoned home and notified police on September 2, 2004. Late in the evening of September 3, an anonymous male caller contacted 911 dispatch to claim responsibility for killing the two victims discovered the day before, and notified police where to find an additional body hidden in an alley a few blocks away from the first two. The caller contacted 911 again on September 4 to reveal the location of two more victims in an overgrown area near a highway, and promised to call again. He stopped contacting dispatchers after a news station leaked information about how the caller was using a cell phone. Police found several additional murder victims, one of whom had earlier been erroneously classified as a drug overdose, and several women who reported rapes and assaults possibly linked to the murders. All the victims were found in a small radius near Prospect Avenue. Investigation gradually narrowed down on Blair as a suspect. He was on parole for the 1982 murder of Monroe, and also matched the description given by women who claimed to have survived rapes and physical assaults. A witness claimed Blair had threatened to kill prostitutes. Investigators were not able to tie Blair directly to the cell phone used to make the 911 calls, as it had been stolen and subsequently used only to make emergency 911 calls, but cell tower data established that the calls originated near where he lived. Blair was initially arrested on a parole violation charge, having failed to stay in contact with a probation officer, and was later charged with the homicides. October 15, 2004, Terry Blair was charged with eight counts of first-degree murder, one count of first-degree assault, and three counts of forcible rape.Circuit Court Docket Sheet 16th Judicial Circuit. 6 December 2004Indictment 04CR203141. Circuit Court of Jackson County Missouri. 3 December 2004 Prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty in exchange for Blair waiving his right to a jury trial, and thus Judge John O'Malley oversaw the bench trial. Two of the murder charges (for Sandra Reed and Nellia Harris) were dropped. The rape and assault charges were also dropped. Although the evidence was mainly circumstantial, Blair's DNA was found on victim Sheliah McKinzie. Blair's defense was that this item of evidence only proved he had engaged in sex with the victim. The prosecution countered that since she hadn't tidied herself up afterwards, Blair must have been the last to see her alive. Blair denied making the 911 calls, and the prosecution introduced linguistics testimony to confirm their assertion that Blair made the 911 calls. The judge ruled the weight of evidence indicated the voice was Blair's. Judge O'Malley ruled Blair guilty on March 27, 2008, and he was sentenced to six life sentences with no possibility of parole for these six murders. Because Blair continues to deny responsibility for the crimes, his motive cannot be understood beyond a compulsion to kill prostitutes. Blair is currently housed in the Potosi Correctional Center in Mineral Point, Missouri. Blair appealed his conviction, but his appeal was denied by the Missouri Court of Appeals in August, 2009. List of victims Below is the list of victims Terry Blair was convicted of killing: *Angela Monroe *Anna Ewing, 42, died on or before July 14, 2004. *Patricia Wilson Butler, 58, died on or before September 2, 2004. *Sheliah McKinzie, 38, died on or before September 2, 2004. *Darci I.

Two versions of the board were released, Atari System 1 and Atari System 2. Atari System 1 The Atari System 1 was Atari Games' first upgradeable arcade game hardware platform. Introduced in 1984, the System 1 platform was used for the following games: *Marble Madness (1984) *Peter Pack Rat (1985) *Road Runner (1985) *Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1985) *Relief Pitcher (1986) (unreleased prototype) (Note: In 1992 Atari Games released a different game titled Relief Pitcher (video game) which used completely different hardware) *RoadBlasters (1987) The hardware used a large circuit board with a Motorola 68010 main CPU running at 7.159 MHz, a MOS Technology 6502 sound CPU running at 1.789 MHz, a system ROM, text and graphics display hardware, and control interfaces. Two large edge-card connectors allowed a \\"cartridge board\\" to be plugged in; the cartridge board supplied the main program ROMs, sound program ROMs, graphics ROMs, graphics shift registers, a \\"SLAPSTIC\\" copy protection chip, a Yamaha YM2151 FM sound generator, a POKEY and (for some games) TI TMS5220 LPC speech synthesis chip. System 1 was capable of generating a max resolution of 336 x 240 with 256 colors from a palette of 1024 colors. Converting one System 1 game into another generally required replacing the cartridge board, attraction marquee, control panel, and in some cases installing additional controls (e.g., foot pedal for Road Blasters). Several games (most notably Gauntlet and Gauntlet II) used hardware that was electrically very similar to System 1, but implemented on a single board rather than using a cartridge board. Early System 1 boards and cartridge boards used large numbers of 7400 series TTL chips. These boards were later replaced by the functionally identical \\"System 1 LSI Main\\" and \\"LSI Cartridge\\" boards, which used ASICs for reduced manufacturing costs. Modular or upgradeable video games were not commonly offered by the major video game companies in the 1970s and 1980s, because it was more profitable to sell an entirely new machine. System 1 and the Japanese JAMMA wiring standard were attempts to move to a modular solution, though there were many smaller companies that sold conversion kits for competitors' hardware. The System 1 and its games are noted for the use of \\"raw\\" sounding FM Synthesizers for sound effects and music: that is, the music many times used instruments that had the modulation settings turned too high or too low to emulate realistic sounding instruments, instead creating a warbly or noisy sound. Atari System 2 Very soon after the introduction of the Atari System 1, the Atari System 2 was introduced. The System 2 platform was used for the following games: *Paperboy (1985) *720¬∞ (1986) *Super Sprint (1986) *Championship Sprint (1986) *APB : All Points Bulletin (1987) *Accelerator (unreleased prototype) *Gremlins (unreleased prototype) Probably the most noticeable difference between the System 2 and System 1 games was the fact that the System 2 used higher-resolution graphics. The video resolution was 512x384 and as such a medium-resolution monitor was used (System 1 used low resolution). The hardware was similar to its predecessor in the fact that it used two main circuit boards. In this case it used a \\"CPU board\\" and a \\"Video Board\\". The EPROMs were split between both boards. The main CPU was a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) T-11 microprocessor running at 10 MHz. The sound CPU was a MOS Technology 6502 running at 1.789 MHz, and the sound chips used were a Yamaha YM2151 running at approx. 3.579 MHz, 2 POKEYs at approx. 1.789 MHz and a TMS5220 running at 625 kHz.

Farmer describes a fictional-author story as \\"a tale supposedly written by an author who is a character in fiction.\\"Farmer 1979 Carey, who had access to Farmer's correspondence while editing the book, reveals in his introduction that in the early to mid-1970s Farmer planned to edit an anthology of fictional-author stories by other writers. Farmer solicited fictional-author stories from authors such as Arthur Jean Cox, Philip K. Dick, Leslie Fiedler, Ron Goulart, Howard Waldrop, and Gene Wolfe, urging them to submit their stories to venues such as The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. Only Cox, Waldrop, and Wolfe completed their stories and had them published, although Philip K.

Bothe is founder of the recent field of research on Neurobionics. Life Bothe studied Philosophy and Medicine from 1973 until 1981 in T√ºbingen und Mainz, graduated 1978 in Philosophy with Magister Artium, later working for three years at the Max-Planck-Institute for Neurological Research in Cologne. He received his PhD in 1983 (thesis: Artificial Brain Abscess in Cats and Therapy with Antibiotics and Steroids). He specialized in Neurosurgery and completed his residency training at Johannes Gutenberg-University in Mainz. After achieving habilitation in 1991 he taught at Hanover Medical School and worked together with Madjid Samii at Nordstadt Hospital in Hanover. In 1993 he obtained a tenured professor for Neurosurgery at Westf√§lische Wilhelms-University in M√ºnster. Bothe initiated and organized the 1st International Workshop on Neurobionics in 1992 and founded thereby the recent field of research on Neurobionics, which aims at substitution of impaired functions of brain and spinal cord by neurosurgical implantation of microelectronic systems. For that purpose, he brought together an international consortium of scientists covering for mathematics, neuroinformatics, biological basic research, microsystems, and medicine.Neurobionics - an interdisciplinary approach to substitute impaired functions of the human nervous system, Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1993 leftIn 1991 he launched the International Neurobionics Foundation together with Daniel Goeudevert, Madjid Samii, and other representatives of science, industry, and policy.

After the attack of Timur, the Delhi Sultanate became weak. Dilawar Khan Ghauri was governor of the Malwa province of central India during the decline of the Delhi Sultanate. Dilawar Khan declared himself Sultan of Malwa in 1401, and passed the kingdom to his son Hoshang Shah upon his death. Thus he had practically come to Mandu in 1401 as the first King of Malwa. Dilawar had also shifted the capital from Dhar to Mandu, renaming it Shadiabad, the city of joy. The successor of Dilawar Khan Gauri was Hushang Shah Gori (1405-1435), who constructed fort at strategically important Mandsaur city to strengthen his north-west boundary. Sikandar bin Mahmud:Mirat-e-Sikandar, p. 113 He is also remembered for his wonderful taste in architecture. It was he who made Mandu one of the most impregnable forts of India. The Sisodia rulers of Mewar by this time were becoming strong. Mandsaur fort was mainly associated with Mandu rulers.

The program stresses the need to place the highest priority on sobriety and uses mutual support to assist members in achieving this goal. The Suggested Guidelines for Sobriety emphasize rational decision-making and are not religious or spiritual in nature. SOS represents an alternative to the spiritually based addiction recovery programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). SOS members may also attend AA meetings, but SOS does not view spirituality or surrendering to a Higher Power as being necessary to maintain abstinence. History James Christopher's alcoholism began when he was a teenager. He had originally sought help in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), but was uncomfortable with the emphasis on God and religion and he began looking for direction in the writings of secular humanists. Christopher wrote about his frustrations with AA and his own developing program for recovery. In 1985, Free Inquiry published an article \\"Sobriety Without Superstition\\" written by Christopher. He received hundreds of letters in response and decided to organize secular, self-help, alcoholism recovery group meetings. The first such meeting was held in November 1986 in North Hollywood, California, and meetings continue to this day at the Center for Inquiry in Los Angeles and at other locations. Christopher has been continuously sober since 1978.  Processes  SOS recognizes genetic and environmental factors contributing to addiction, but allows each member to decide whether or not alcoholism is a disease. SOS holds the view that alcoholics can recover (addictive behaviors can be arrested), but that ultimately it is never cured; relapse is always possible. SOS does not endorse sponsor/sponsee relationships. The SOS program is based on the Suggested Guidelines for Sobriety, that emphasize the \\"sobriety priority.\\" In order to change, members must make abstinence their top priority: not drinking despite changing conditions in their lives. SOS suggests members follow a daily, three part, Cycle of Sobriety: acknowledgment of their addiction, acceptance of their addictions and prioritization of maintaining sobriety. Members are also encouraged to develop strategies or aphorisms that strengthen their resolve to maintain sobriety. on what SOS teaches Suggested Guidelines for Sobriety These guidelines are suggested by SOS for maintaining sobriety. *To break the cycle of denial and achieve sobriety, we first acknowledge that we are alcoholics or addicts. *We reaffirm this daily and accept without reservation the fact that as clean and sober individuals, we can not and do not drink or use, no matter what. *Since drinking or using is not an option for us, we take whatever steps are necessary to continue our Sobriety Priority lifelong. *A quality of life, \\"the good life,\\" can be achieved. However, life is also filled with uncertainties. Therefore, we do not drink or use regardless of feelings, circumstances, or conflicts. *We share in confidence with each other our thoughts and feelings as sober, clean individuals. *Sobriety is our Priority, and we are each responsible for our lives and sobriety. Meetings While each SOS meeting is autonomous, SOS does provide a meeting format. The opening reading for meeting conveners summarizes their program. Following the reading of the opening, typically there are announcements, acknowledgment of members sobriety anniversaries and a reading of the Suggested Guidelines. The suggested opening reads as follows. Demographics A preliminary survey of SOS members was conducted in 1996. The survey results showed SOS attracted members with secular attitudes; 70% had no current religious affiliation and 70% were self-described atheists or agnostics, while another 22% described themselves as spiritual but non- churchgoers. SOS members were predominantly white (99%) employed (nearly half were employed full-time) males (1/4 of the respondents were female) over the age of 40. Abstinence was the reported goal of 86% of SOS members; 70% of respondents reported that they were currently abstinent (for an average of 6.3 years), another 16% were \\"mostly abstinent.\\" The majority of SOS members planned long-term affiliation with SOS. Nearly every member surveyed had been exposed to AA, the average rate of AA attendance amongst SOS members in the previous month was 4.5 meetings. A 2007 survey of addiction recovery groups found that religiosity correlated negatively with participation in SOS.

He served during the First World War but is most remembered as an inventor, for development of the device named after him, the Dumaresq, which helped users calculate the rate at which the range to an enemy ship was changing over time. He was the first Australian born officer to command the Australian Fleet. Early life Dumaresq was the grandson of a British settler who had originally gone to Australia accompanying the Governor of New South Wales, Ralph Darling in 1825. In 1907 he married Christian Elizabeth Louisa Dalrymple. Naval career He lived in England from age two and became a naval cadet at HMS Britannia in 1886. He became interested in torpedoes and gunnery and introduced a number of innovations. In 1904 he was promoted to commander. In 1908 he commanded a flotilla escorting King Edward VII on a tour of Russia and was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order from the King and awarded the Order of Saint Catherine from the Tsar. On 30 June 1910 he was promoted to captain, working on fire control equipment at the Royal Navy war college at Portsmouth. In 1913 he became captain of and took part in the Battle of Jutland. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath for his part in the battle In February 1917 he was appointed commanding officer of , which was serving as part of the Grand Fleet in the North Sea. Shortly afterwards, the ship and its accompanying patrol were involved in an attack by a Zeppelin. Dumaresq attempted to trap the Zeppelin by ordering the accompanying ships to disperse, leaving the Zeppelin attempting to bomb his ship and coming closer, and then ordering them back forming a ring surrounding the enemy. The Zeppelin remained too high, meaning the ships' anti-aircraft guns could not reach it, but also the Zeppelin could not aim reliably enough to drop bombs on the ships below. Dumaresq became convinced of the need for aircraft to operate from ships and a platform to his design was installed on Sydney in October 1917 for the purpose of launching an aeroplane. During an engagement with enemy destroyers at Heligoland Bight on 1 June 1918, the aircraft was used in action to drive off two attacking German aeroplanes, shooting down one. Dumaresq was appointed Commodore Commanding the Australian Fleet on 22 March 1919, as the first Australian born officer to do so. His flagship then became . Ships of the Australian navy had been distributed around the world during the war, but now returned to Australian waters based at Sydney. His period of command was marked by disagreement with the Australian government over expenditure upon the navy. In 1920 he was advanced to Commander of the Royal Victorian Order and in June 1921 was promoted to rear admiral. In April 1922 he was posted back to the Royal Navy. On the return journey he contracted pneumonia, and died in the US Military Hospital in Manila on 22 July.

Specifically, \\"the selling or delivering of kosher meat by any person who, according to his religious belief, observes Saturday as the Lord's day by closing his place of business during the day until six o'clock in the afternoon, or the keeping open of his shop on the Lord's day for the sale of kosher meat between the hours of six o'clock and ten o'clock in the forenoon.\\" The store had formerly been open for business all day on Sundays and had done about a third of its weekly business then. It was closed from sundown on Fridays until sundown on Saturdays. The store had claimed that it was economically impractical for it to keep open on Saturday nights and until 10 a.m. on Sundays. Many who bought at the store would not have been able to get meat from Friday afternoon until Monday. Counsel of Record ACLU Side: Herbert B. Ehrmann, with Samuel L. Fein on the brief. Opposing Side: Joseph H. Elcock, Jr., Asst. Attorney General of Massachusetts. With him on the brief were Edward J. McCormack, Jr., John Warren McGarry, Arthur E. Sutherland, Jr., and S. Thomas Martinelli.See case summary and details on the ProCon site. Opinion of the Court The court 6-3 approved the state law, due to the laws not being exclusively religious. \\"An examination of recent Massachusetts legislative history bolsters the State's position that these statutes are not religious. \\"In general, Sunday laws protect the public by guaranteeing one day in seven to provide a period of rest and quiet. Health, peace and good order of society are thereby promoted. Such provision is essentially civil in character, and the statutes are not regarded as religious ordinances.\\" Also on the issue of free exercise of religion they stated: \\"Secondly, appellees Orthodox Jewish customers allege that, because their religious beliefs forbid their shopping on the Jewish Sabbath, the statutes' effect is to deprive them, from Friday afternoon until Monday of each week, of the opportunity to purchase the kosher food sanctioned by their faith. The orthodox rabbis allege that the statutes' effect greatly complicates their task of supervising the condition of kosher meat, because the meat delivered on Friday would have to be kept until Monday. Furthermore, appellees contend that, because of all this, the statutes discriminate against their religion. These allegations are similar, although not as grave, as those made by appellants in Braunfeld v. Brown, ante, p. 366 U.S. 599. Since the decision in that case rejects the contentions presented by these appellees on the merits, we need not decide whether appellees have standing to raise these questions.\\" Justices William O. Douglas, William J. Brennan, Jr. and Potter Stewart dissented from the opinion. Subsequent developments This was one of the four cases decided in 1961 that declared blue laws to be constitutional. The other three were Braunfeld v. Brown, Two Guys from Harrison-Allentown, Inc., v. McGinleyCase in Wikisource and McGowan v. Maryland  See also  * McGowan v.

The directors, at various times, were Cecil J Greenwood, Kenneth W Marshall, John Morris and the New Zealander Terence T Bond. It also incorporated another imprint Cranley & Day. In its short existence Boriswood published at least 68 titles, in fine limited and trade editions, mainly of new poetry and fiction. Boriswood‚Äôs first trade edition book was printed in the basement of Boriswood's premises 15A Harrington Road, South Kensington on an electrified platen press. Boriswood‚Äôs list was left-leaning, modernist and provocative. Roy Campbell was one of the first poets to be published by the firm (The Georgiad 1931) while James Hanley was their most important novelist. Hanley‚Äôs Boy was one of their first books, published in 1931. It eventually led to Boriswood‚Äôs prosecution in Manchester in 1935 for obscene libel. Boriswood pleaded guilty (as advised) and was fined a large sum. This, together with the associated controversy, eventually led to its closure and its stock was purchased by Greenwood. T E Lawrence and K W Marshall corresponded about the litigation around Boy. The remaining copies of the trade edition of Boy were sold to the Obelisk Press which re-published it in 1935. (It was republished by Penguin in 1990 with an introduction by Anthony Burgess). Amongst Boriswood‚Äôs other authors were Georges Bernanos, Hart Crane, Vardis Fisher, Simon Jesty, Archibald MacLeish, John Pudney, Jules Romains and Rex Warner.Laura Marcus, Peter Nicholls, The Cambridge History of Twentieth- Century English Literature. Cambridge University Press, 2004. (p. 370). Boriswood published several translations of Soviet fiction by Alec Brown, including Yury Tynyanov's Death and Diplomacy in Persia.Ali Gheissari, Iranian Intellectuals in the Twentieth Century. University of Texas Press, 2010 (p. 237) Boriswood employed important illustrators of the day including David Jones and New Zealand-born artist James Boswell for its illustrated dust wrappers. Boriswood's non fiction list included risqu√© titles for their day such as The Sexual Impulse (1935) by Edward Charles and, unusually, a book on furniture and design, extensively illustrated with photographs, Modern Furniture (1936) by E Nelson Exton and Frederic H Littman.

The building was located on the A496, adjacent to Theatr Harlech (formerly called Theatr Ardudwy) on the campus of Coleg Harlech, and Royal St David's Golf Club. Design and construction The St. David's Hotel is based on proposals drawn-up in January 1907 by George Henry Walton, a Glasgow School architect and contemporary of Charles Rennie Mackintosh.Moon, K.; \\"George Walton: Designer and Architect\\"; White Cockade Publishing, Dorset, 1993; (hb) (pb) The proposals were subsequently revised in 1908, and the hotel was built in 1910. Architectural drawing by George Walton of St David's Hotel, Harlech dated 4 October 1908 from his studio at 26 Emperor's Gate, South Kensington, London The Hotel has five storeys and a basement. The height of the Hotel was disguised by having the upper three floors included in a giant mansard with rows of dormers.Haslam, R., Orbach., J., Voelcker, A.; Pevsner Architectural Guides: The Buildings of Wales, Gwynedd; 2009; Yale University Press The Hotel reflects skilled craftsmanship, in the handling of materials and detail, that echoes Walton's earlier design for Wern Fawr (now Coleg Harlech). Wern Fawr has been described as being \\"at the apex of building craft\\" and St David's Hotel has been described as Walton \\"at his most professional\\". At St David's Hotel, Walton provided solutions to a challenging commercial design brief that included the traditional use of heavy masonry on the exterior of the Hotel, which was intended to reflect the use of this material in the locality. In conjunction with this, Walton used reinforced concrete to open-up the interiors in order to simplify structural problems, make the most of the sea views, and give the interior \\"a cheerfulness which could survive even a dull Harlech day\\". Mezzogravure by Alvin Langdon Coburn of St David's Hotel taken in 1920 and published in ‚ÄúThe Book of Harlech‚Äù, a collection of his prints of the locality. Source: J. Paul Getty Museum The Hotel sits on the edge of the Harlech Conservation Area.http://www.eryri- npa.co.uk/print/consmap.php?id=harlech‚ü®=eng Retrieved 22 January 2010 The exterior design responds to the character of the more traditional buildings nearby, because of its use of stone and traditional form. Walton also designed all the fixtures and fittings for the Hotel, including fitted furniture, carpets, tables, chairs, settees and ironmongery, working to a tight budget. Walton is one of the forerunners of later European architects, such as the Danish architect Arne Jacobsen, whose design brief for St Catherine's College, Oxford included all the interior fixtures and fittings.Davies, M & D; \\"Creating St Catherine's College\\"; St Catherine's College, Oxford, 1997; St David's Hotel, Harlech, photograph taken before 1922 The Hotel was built for a syndicate, in which George Walton was involved, and catered primarily for golfers visiting the adjacent Royal St David's Golf Club. The Hotel has been used by generations of golfers and other visitors to Harlech, who retain fond memories.http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/northwest/sites/harlech/pages/askalocal.shtml Retrieved 22 January 2010 The Hotel had 60 bedrooms and served traditional home-cooked food, facilities included an early twentieth-century lift (elevator), a snooker table, an outdoor pool, and a solarium. Fire In 1922, a devastating fire destroyed the interior of the Hotel, so that Walton's original design commission has been lost. The Hotel was then rebuilt hurriedly by Griffith Morris. The three bay centre is now flanked by two storeys of stone, two of roughcast and the attic only is mansarded. The centre has also been altered on the top two floors and has a ground floor addition. St David's Hotel, Harlech, after the fire in 1922. Source: Collection of Ken Wyn Jones M.B.E., Porthmadog It is unclear from the records how much of the original interior structure has survived. The later, low quality, extensions have diminished the grand aspect of Walton's original structure. Despite this, the Hotel is retained in Cadw's listing description for Coleg Harlech, which is a Grade II* Listed Building, and this suggests that the Hotel was notable due to its group value.

On 17 December 2008, the DCW issued a Design Review Report which concluded, inter alia, that the replacement hotel complex would be an \\"overdevelopment of the site\\".Design Review Report/Addroddiad Adolygu Dylunio of the Design Commission For Wales/Comisiwn Dylunio Cymru, issued on 17 December 2008 http://dcfw.org/design/reports/view/st_davids_hotel_harlech Retrieved 22 January 2010 St David's Hotel, Harlech, 2008 Planning Application NP5/61/23L was heard, and approved, by the SNPA's Planning and Access Committee at a public meeting held at Plas Tan y Bwlch, Maentwrog on April 29, 2009. It was resolved to demolish the Hotel and that demolition was within the provisions of the Eryri Local Planhttp://www.eryri- npa.gov.uk/page/index.php?nav1=livingin&nav2;=5&nav3;=1‚ü®=eng&view;=graphic&contrast;=2 Retrieved 22 January 2010 prepared by the SNPA under the provision of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and formally adopted by resolution of the National Park Committee up to 2003. The Design Review Report of the DCW notes that: \\"there has been very little community response\\" to the proposed demolition of the Hotel. The hotel was finally demolished in October 2019, with the Welsh Government and Gwynedd Council contributing to the cost. Planning dispute In December 2015 the SNPA filed an enforcement notice under section 215 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (TCPA) requiring the owners, Aitchinson Associates Limited (AAL) of Gibraltar, to demolish the Hotel, which had remained closed since 2008 and had subsequently fallen into disrepair. AAL had until April 28, 2017 for the site to be cleared completely. However demolition work did not take place and AAL were taken to court by the SNPA due to a lack of action. The Magistrates' court (England and Wales) at Caernarfon fined AAL the maximum fine under Section 215 of the TCPA, in the amount of ¬£1,000, together with a victim surcharge of ¬£100, and awarded costs to the SNPA of ¬£552.20. The SNPA noted the poor condition of the Hotel, with windows rotting, dormer windows completely perished, and sections of the roof collapsed. The SNPA also commented that it had been inundated with complaints from local residents and visitors to Harlech about the poor condition of the Hotel building, which lies in an elevated position adjacent to the A496 road. On 17 October 2018, the SNPA's Planning and Access Committee considered exploring the possibility of initiating formal ‚Äòdirect action‚Äô under Section 219 of the TCPA, in order to attempt to secure the demolition of the Hotel, due to the untidy condition of the building. In April, 2018 AAL were fined ¬£20,900 and ordered to pay costs of ¬£782 by Caernarfon Magistrates' court for failing to comply with the court order to demolish the Hotel. The SNPA noted that demolition of the Hotel remains subject to securing funding, but in a press release they stated that they are keen to address other issues to help facilitate the demolition work, should funding become available. The SNPA pointed out that a key issue is the building of a structure within which the bats that currently live in the Hotel can be relocated, noting that all species of bats and their roosts are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. With the permission of AAL a contractor was commissioned to construct a small bat barn on the site during the first quarter of 2019.

He sailed with the First Fleet as surgeon on the Scarborough, which transported English convicts to Port Jackson, Australia, in 1788. Pioneering Australian pharmaceutical research Considen used indigenous Australian plants to treat a range of diseases afflicting the convict settlement, including scurvy and dysentery. Pharmaceutical preparations included kino from Eucalyptus and Angophora, 'yellow gum' resin from Xanthorrhoea spp., native sarsaparilla Smilax glyciphylla, and the 'large peppermint-tree' Eucalyptus piperita. In November 1788 Considen proclaimed himself to English colleague, Dr Anthony Hamilton, as the colony's pharmaceutic pioneer: \\"...if there is any merit in applying these & many other simples[sic] to the benefit of the poor wretches here, I certainly claim it, being the first who discovered & recommended them.\\".Copy of letter received by Dr Anthony Hamilton, from Dennis Considen, 18 November 1788, and sent onto Joseph Banks.

Considen was granted leave because of ill health, and sailed on the Kitty for Ireland. He arrived at Cork in February 1794. Back in Ireland, he served as a hospital mate in the Army Medical Service until he was appointed deputy-purveyor for service on the European Continent. In August 1799, he was promoted to the position of purveyor. This enabled him to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh and to better support his family. Considen graduated as a Doctor of Medicine on the 24 June 1804, with a thesis entitled De Tetano, in which he refers to his discovery of eucalyptus oil.Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal: Exhibiting A Concise View of the Latest and Most Important Discoveries in Medicine, Surgery, and Pharmacy, Volume Twentieth, 1824. He was subsequently called to Cork to join an expedition bound for the Cape. Considen maintained an interest in New South Wales and its natural history. He kept contact with his friends Thomas Arndell, George Johnston and D'Arcy Wentworth. Surviving records of Considen's character indicate that he was a humane man with an earnest desire to do well in his profession. On 6 January 1812 he was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians. He died in 1815.

Life The first appearance of Pattishall in the records was in 1190, where he served as the escheator for Northamptonshire and also as a judge, serving in Westminster and as a circuit justice or Eyre. He entered the administration in 1193, most likely thanks to his association with Geoffrey Fitz Peter, and was appointed High Sheriff of Essex and Hertfordshire, a position he held until 1194. In 1194 as part of Richard I's reshuffling of sheriffs following his release from captivity, he was made High Sheriff of Northamptonshire until 1203. During the reigns of Richard I's and John he served as an itinerant justice, and emerged as the senior justice of the Court of Common Pleas around 1190, a role that was only disrupted by the First Barons' War. He served with the court in 1204, and again in 1207 continuously until John's departure to Poitou in 1214. During the time Pattishall was working in the administration the separation between the judiciary and the exchequer was not yet complete, and he often performed financial tasks. He was Collector of the Carucage in 1198 and again in 1200, and one of the Keepers of the Jews in 1198. In 1213 he was a commissioner assessing damage done to churches in the Diocese of Canterbury following the 1208 Interdict, which was lifted after John submitted to Pope Innocent III. It was during the reign of King John that he emerged as senior judge of the Court of Common Pleas, and he accompanied John on his 1210 trip to Ireland to install English law and custom there. In a core of 15 professional royal justices, he was remembered by Matthew Paris as one \\"who at one time guided the reins of the justices of the whole kingdom\\". His special position is also confirmed by the fact that, among the plea rolls produced by the clerks of the various justices, it was those of Pattishall that were considered authoritative, and preserved for future reference.Judges, Administrators and the Common Law in Angevin England, p. 199. He fell foul of the King in 1207, however, and he and a colleague were fined 100 Marks for allowing a compromise settlement on a criminal case, although they were later pardoned. In 1215 at the beginning of the First Baron's War Pattishall's lands were confiscated, not because of questions of his loyalty but most likely because they were in a county under rebel control. John was persuaded to relax his restrictions by the Abbot of Woburn, and Pattishall recovered his property by the end of 1215, beginning judicial work again in 1216. Starting with little land, Pattishall increased his holdings throughout his career, and accumulated six Knight's fees and several smaller holdings near Pattishall. He was granted ownership of the Manor of Rothersthorpe by King John, and temporarily held Fotheringhay Castle in 1212. He married Amice, and had two children; Walter of Pattishall and Hugh of Pattishall, both of whom became royal administrators themselves.Oxford DNB; Pattishall, Simon of He also helped found a judicial dynasty; his clerk Martin of Pattishall later followed him as Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, as did his clerk William de Raley.

He also served as Imperial Secretary (Sacheev) during Emperor Chhatrapati Rajaram‚Äôs reign. He also served as Deputy to the Crown (Rajadnya) under Emperor Sambhaji. His contribution to the war of independence against Mughal rule is considered to be immensely supportive. He was also the founder of the princely state of Bhor located in Pune district. Early life and career Shankaraji was born in a Deshastha Brahmin family in or around 1665. His grandfather was an Officer-in-confidence of Shivaji's father Shahaji, and his father Naro Mukund was a Sabnis of Fort Sudhagad during Shivaji‚Äôs regime. Being friendly and watchful since childhood, Shankraji became well conversant with the people and geography of the Maval region of Maharashtra at a very early age. In 1677, he started his career under Peshwa Moropant Pingale, and soon he was engrossed by Ramchandra Pant Amatya for the purpose of some special assignments in the Maval region. During Sambhaji‚Äôs reign, he was awarded the post of Deputy to the Crown (Rajadnya) for his excellent performance in his field. Contribution to the Maratha War of Independence After the assassination of Sambhaji by Aurangzeb in 1689, Shankaraji gathered his soldiers in Maval and started attacking nearby Mughal forces. Initially, he conquered the forts of Wai and Rajgad. Thereafter, jointly with Ramchandra Pant Amatya, he captured the forts of Pratapgad, Rohida, Torna and Purandar. Aurangzeb‚Äôs General Shaikh Nijam was also defeated by him near Sangameshwar. Jointly with Ramchandra Pant, Santaji and Dhanaji, he attacked another Mughal General Sarjah Khan near Satara and vanquished his army. Rajaram was so delighted with his victories that he conferred on him the post of Sacheeva (Secretary) in October 1690 and, additionally, he was given charge of the entire Konkan region. Thenceforth, Dhanaji was directed to work under his supervision. He was also responsible for Rajaram‚Äôs Zanana (Queens) at fort Karigad. As mentioned in the Jedhe Shakawali, he quickly shifted the Zanana to fort Sudhagad during the capture of Karigad by Alibaig, the Mughal Officer at Junnar, and later on recaptured the fort. He also captured Fort Siddhgad located near Bhimashankar through his subordinate Gunaji Sawant. Later career and death After Rajaram‚Äôs death in 1700, Shankaraji became one of the closest advisors of Rajaram's Queen Tarabai. Jointly with Parshuram Pant Pratinidhi, he helped Tarabai to enable her son Shivaji II to occupy the vacant throne of Rajaram. In 1705, he captured fort Rohida and re-annexed fort Rajgad to the Maratha Empire. In 1707 after Shahu‚Äôs release from Mughal camp civil war between Shahu and Tarabai commenced. Shahu appealed Shankaraji to join him or face the consequences. Shankaraji who was loyal to Tarabai was caught into a great perplexity and depression and ultimately committed suicide in November 1707 at Ambawde near Nagnath. A deeply moved Shahu appointed Shankaraji's orphan son Naro Shankar on his vacant post. References Bibliography * External links *‚ÄòShankaraji Narayan‚Äô (Marathi) by K.V.

History The church was built on the site of an earlier church, dating from possibly the 12th century. This church was badly damaged by a storm in 1843. It was constructed between 1849 and 1850 and the architect was Henry Isaac Stevens. The church was consecrated on 4 November 1850 by the Right Revd. Dr. Kaye, Bishop of Lincoln.The chancel was added in 1900 by William Arthur Heazell. The north chapel was added in 1946. Organ A new organ was opened in 1852 by George Cooper, the assistant organist of St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral. The current pipe organ dates from 1872 by Forster and Andrews.

The term derived from the ancient Greek for ambush and the men carrying out the ambush, but in practice, its meaning was essentially that of \\"war-band\\", a body of armed men. This translation has been used traditionally, e.g. for the Sacred Band of Thebes. Size and organisation Evolving as it did with ancient Greek warfare from that of tribal Greece to that of the Greek city-states, the lochos varied in size and organisation over time and from city state to city state, ranging in size from a single file to about 640 men. The best surviving description of the lochos is that by Xenophon in his Anabasis, however this must be taken as being illustrative of a particular time and place, that of 5th century BC Sparta, rather than being truly representative. Aelian and Arrian use the terms lochos as file and lochagos as file leader.  Lochos as file  A lochos comprised an inconsistent number of men that could range from 8 to 16 men.Asclepiodotus, Tactica 2.1 Asclepiodotus offers three alternative names, namely stichos (), synomotia () and dekania (). The file leader was called a lochagos and the file closer an ouragos. The men in the uneven rows were called protostates, among which the lochagos, and the men in the even rows epistates. Should the line perform a pyknosis (that is, close its ranks by placement of half the lochos in the interval between the original lochoi), then the epistates of the lochagos would become the promachos protostates of the newly employed file. A half-file was called hemilochion () or dimoiria () and a quarter-file enomotia ().Asclepiodotus, Tactica 2.2  Spartan lochos  The Spartan lochos, according to Xenophon, consisted of 640 men, composed of 4 pentekostyes (pl. of pentekostys) of 160 men, with the pentekostyes in turn being composed of 4 enomotiai of about 40 men each. The lochos in turn formed half of a mora, there being 6 morai in the Spartan Army. The morai would normally be commanded by a Polemarch, and the lochos by a lochagos. However, the actual numbers would vary depending on the needs of a campaign. Spartan military organisation relied on dividing its citizen army into eight age classes and a full strength enomotiai consisted of five men from each of the age classes. However, it was unusual to draw men from the older age classes, so, on campaign, an enomotia would consist of 30 to 35 men with the lokhos and mora being correspondingly smaller. If only the first four, or even fewer, age classes were called up, then the \\"short\\" organisational lochos would be grouped together to form a full strength tactical lochos. Whatever the theoretical size of the lochos, units of about 300 men appear frequently in the classical Greek records, this being the number of the Sacred Band of Thebes, the Spartans at Thermopylae, and the number on each side of the \\"Battle of the Champions\\" fought between Argos and Sparta in 546 BC. This number would give a frontage of about 40 shields given the traditional eight- deep phalanx, and probably represents the smallest number needed to form a usable phalanx. Byzantine use In the Byzantine army, the lochos continued to be used as a term for the file. It was the basic infantry unit of usually eight men, composed of the file leader (lochagos) and seven soldiers. In the tradition of the Roman contubernium, this unit slept and ate together in a single tent, and had a permanently attached servant. Alternative names were dekarchion and dekarchos for the file leader, meaning \\"leader of ten\\". Modern use The term lochos, along with the associated rank of lochagos and its derivatives, has been revived in the modern Greek military for a company- sized command.

He was born in T√§tort Liden, Sundsvall Municipality. Gustaf Lindh is the only Olympic champion in Winter Pentathlon. Winter pentathlon was a one-time event solely held at the Olympic Games in 1948 in St. Moritz. Sweden had four participants, including the future Olympic champion in modern pentathlon, William Grut. Grut, Claes Egnell und Bertil Haase were about ten years older than Lindh and at that time the dominant athletes in winter pentathlon, but Lindh went on to beat the favourites. He won the shooting and riding with the only flaw being a sixth rank in the downhill event. His teammate Haase won the downhill and the 10 km cross country as he was an excellent skier, but did not finish tops in shooting, fencing and riding. Grut showed a balanced performance, but Lindh finished a point ahead of him and Haase. The fourth Swede, Egnell, broke his leg in the downhill, and had to abandon the competition in fourth place. Like all other participants, Lindh was also a member of the armed forces. At age seventeen, he had joined the Swedish Army in √ñstersund because of the lack of educational opportunities during World War II. He attended military school (Swedish: volont√§r‚Äì, konstapel‚Äì och furirskola) as a Furir (Private First Class) and excelled in winter sports. Already in his third appearance in a Winter Pentathlon in 1946, he won the Swedish championship and thus qualified for the Olympic Games. In autumn 1948, he was dismissed from the military and began training in the field of energy technology at the Tekniska Fackskolan (Technical Vocational School) in Sundsvall, then worked as an engineer and designer for high-voltage lines. He continued his sports activities until a shattered jaw after a horse riding accident in Stockholm forced him to retire in 1954 and set an end to his career. Lindh spent some years in the United States, went back to Sweden at the end of the 1960s and lives since in Viksj√∂, J√§rf√§lla northwest of Stockholm.

The eyre involved visits and inspections at irregular intervals of the houses of vassals in the kingdom. The term is derived from Old French erre, from Latin iter (\\"journey\\"), and is cognate with errand and errant. Eyre of 1194 The eyre of 1194 was initiated under Hubert Walter's justiciarship to restore royal justice following the anarchy of Prince John's rebellion. Within two months, justices on eyre had visited every shire in England. The Articles of Eyre appointed local knights as coroners to record crown pleas to be presented to the justices. The motivation for this administrative reform was the need to raise money for King Richard I's reconquest of Normandy. The coroners were also required to account for the wealth forfeited by the rebels and list the financial resources of each shire.Robert C.

Life He was born in Brussels, then in the Austrian Netherlands. He lived for a long time on rue de Persil (near place Saint-Michel, now known as Place des Martyrs) in the city, which also passed through French and Dutch hands during his lifetime, and shone in the arts under the Austrian, French and Dutch regimes. He was a student of Hyacinthe de La Peyne, painter to empress Maria Theresa, the sovereign of the Austrian Netherlands, and once followed his teacher to Vienna. Thanks to the protection of Johann Karl Philipp von Cobenzl, Maria-Theresa's minister-plenipotentiary in Brussels, Cardon became a pensionary of the government and was thus able to stay for a time in Rome and Naples. Recalled to Brussels by Cobenzl, he became a professor at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts and made his artistic career in the city - his pupils included Ad√®le Kindt. It was there in 1810 that he and Antoine Brice founded an association of professional and amateur artists. In 1822 Cardon was named a member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands by William II of the Netherlands. He was a highly enthusiastic member of Freemasonry, then having great success in the nobility of the Austrian Netherlands - his name is among the first initiates of the \\"loge de l'Union\\" (third lodge in Brussels, n¬∞ 9, inscribed on the tables of 1783 and 1786), and he engraved several Masonic diplomas and emblems.

The church is Grade I listed by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport as a building of outstanding architectural or historic interest. History The present day church consists of a medieval chancel with north vestry (now housing an organ) and south wall chancel door, clerestoried nave, north and south aisles, south porch, west tower and spire, and west-end vestries and galilee added in the 20th century. It is set within a conventional churchyard that is walled and gated on Church Lane (north side). A chapel is said to have existed on the banks of the River Trent at Attenborough n 964 AD and was overbuilt with the stone chancel of the present day church. The chancel was thought to exist as early as 1042 and is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 where it is referred to as being shared by Chilwell and Toton. These two communities had formed at a distance on higher ground, probably as a result of the church being built on a gravel ridge adjacent to the river where there was little room for community expansion around it without the risk of frequent flooding of the homes. The boundary division of these two civil parishes divided the churchyard for many years. The spire was rebuilt in 1848 and reaches a height of . The church was restored in 1869 by the architect Richard Charles Sutton.Nottinghamshire Guardian - Friday 1 October 1869 The west end gallery was removed, and the belfry arch was opened up. Until the 20th century, Attenborough was the ecclesiastical parish responsible for the souls of the Chilwell and Toton communities. Bramcote was also adjoined with Attenborough, the parish being known as Attenborough cum Bramcote. In 1903 a separate mission church, Christ Church, had been built at Chilwell, and in 1923, a daughter church, St Peter's, was built at Toton. In 1957, a further mission church was built at the extremity of the rapidly developing area of Chilwell and was known as St. Barnabas Church, Inham Nook. Eventually, in 1967 Bramcote became a separate parish and Rev James Hamilton-Brown became its first vicar. Then in 1975 Chilwell was recognised as a parish in its own right and became Chilwell with Inham Nook. The first vicar of this newly formed parish was the Rev John Williams. At the same time in 1975 Attenborough became Attenborough with Toton and merited its own vicar; the first vicar being Rev Frank Beech who was previously the curate at Attenborough. A small amount of the old parish, which was situated South of the River Trent, was at this time transferred to Clifton. This arrangement continued until once more, due to population growth, it was necessary to divide Attenborough and Toton to form separate parishes. This division took effect from 1 May 2001 and Rev Peter Gibbs was to be re-licensed as vicar of Toton. This development time-line is necessary to understand the complexities of the historical ecclesiastical parish of Attenborough, once known as the 'ABC Empire' (after a former UK cinema chain), otherwise, Attenborough, Bramcote and Chilwell with St Barnabas', Inham Nook, and St Peter's, Toton plus the Chilwell Garrison church on MOD land. Henry Ireton, the son-in-law of Oliver Cromwell, was baptised here in 1611. Stained glass File:East window, St Mary's Church, Attenborough.jpgEast window in memory of John Royston Pearson.

Organ Organ of 1928 An organ was provided by Mr. Groves of London, and was restored in 1869 by Lloyd and Dudgeon of Nottingham. The current organ was installed in 1928 by Brindley & Foster. Monuments and memorials Early armorial bearings for the Babington, Nevil and Leake families of the 13th and 14th centuries were said to be visibly incorporated into certain church windows as late as 1840 but unfortunately no longer exist. Later centuries are well represented by various arms and plaques. The most colourful of these is a carved wooden memorial bearing the arms of the Powtrell family, dated 1623 and depicted in red, white and gold on black. It is located on the east wall of the chancel. Also on the east wall is the alabaster memorial plaque to John Mather, Vicar of Attenborough, 1586‚Äì1625. Also mentioned are his two wives, Elizabeth and Joane. The north wall of the chancel holds a brass plaque commemorating the Foljambe family who were for three centuries connected with the church. Also on this wall is a memorial to Francis Jaques, alias Gambard, of Toton, and his wife and children. Francis died 27 August 1606. The inscription tells us, that the memorial was erected by George, the oldest son. High on the wall of the north aisle are the Warren arms, a hatchment measuring . This is associated with Admiral Sir John Borlace Warren, grandson of Arthur Warren and the heiress of Sir John Borlace. He was created a baronet in 1775. The choir stalls, with four carved panels of mermaids and mermen (with initials I.P. part of the Powtrell family arms) bear the following inscription \\"To the Glory of God, and in loving memory of Josiah Brown of Attenborough and his wife Elizabeth of Bramcote. These stalls were given by their children. MCMXXVIII\\" Incumbents Originally the incumbent was a Rector, but this was changed in 1346 to Vicar. Churchyard The churchyard is described in the Terrier of 1777 as about of land, well fenced on the east with quick hedges, bounded on the north and west by Robert Holbrook's house, barn and thick walls of stone, and on the South by a stone wall and brook. The east is still bounded by quick hedges and iron railings. The north is still bounded in part by the wall to Ireton House and also by a purpose built wall to the boundary of Church Lane. The original iron gates were put in situ in 1842 at a cost of ¬£85.d. and then replaced in the 20th century. The thick stone wall boundary between Ireton House and the west end of the church remains, but the stone wall on the south has disappeared to be replaced by hedging and alder trees. There were several elm trees situated along the north and south boundaries but unfortunately these were claimed by Dutch Elm Disease in the 1980s. The church stands on the highest level of the churchyard with the land falling away slightly to the south and north. The churchyard does sometimes flood after a very wet winter with the water rising from the River Trent and gravel pit lakes to the South. Although access to the church is difficult at these times, the church building has never been flooded.

Earliest record The Branimir Inscription, 888 Although in 2005 it was archaeologically confirmed that the ethnonym Croatorum is mentioned in a church inscription found in Bijaƒái near Trogir dated to the end of the 8th or early 9th century, it is generally accepted that the first attestation of the ethnonym is in the Latin charter of Duke Trpimir from 852, the original of which has been lost. A copy has been preserved in a 1568 transcript; Lujo Margetiƒá proposed in 2002 that the document is in fact of legislative character, dating to 840. In it is mentioned: :Dux Chroatorum iuvatus munere divino [‚Ä¶] Regnum Chroatorum The presumably oldest stone inscription is the Latin Branimir Inscription (found in ≈†opot near Benkovac), where Duke Branimir (879‚Äì892) is mentioned: :'''' The monument with the earliest writing in the Croatian language containing the ethnonym x—ärvat—ä () is the Ba≈°ka tablet from 1100, which reads: zv—än—ämir—ä kral—ä xr—ävat—äsk—ä (\\"Zvonimir, king of Croats\\"). Etymology Tanais Tablet B containing the word ŒßŒøœÅŒøŒ¨Œ∏ŒøœÇ (Khoro√°thos). The exact origin and meaning of the ethnonym HrÃÄvƒÅt (Proto-Slavic *X—ärv√°t—ä, or *XurwƒÅtu) is still subject to scientific disagreement. It is believed that the word might not be of native Slavic lexical stock, but a borrowing from an Iranian language. Common theories from the 20th and 21st centuries derive it from an Iranian origin, the root word being a third-century Scytho-Sarmatian form attested in the Tanais Tablets as ŒßŒøœÅŒøŒ¨Œ∏ŒøœÇ (Khoro√°thos, alternate forms comprise Khor√≥atos and Khoro√∫athos). The first etymological thesis about the name of the Croats stems from Constantine Porphyrogennetos (tenth century), who connected the different names of the Croats, ŒíŒµŒªŒøœáœÅœâŒ≤Œ¨œÑŒøŒπ and ŒßœÅœâŒ≤Œ¨œÑŒøŒπ (Belokhrobatoi and Khrobatoi), with the Greek word œáœéœÅŒ± (kh·πìra, \\"land\\"): \\"Croats in Slavic language means those who have many lands\\". In the 13th century, Thomas the Archdeacon considered that it was connected with the name of inhabitants of the Krk isle, which he gave as Curetes, Curibantes. In the 17th century, Juraj Ratkaj found a reflexion of the verb hrvati (se) \\"to wrestle\\" in the name. In the 19th century, many different derivations were proposed for the Croatian ethnonym: * Josef Dobrovsk√Ω believed it to be linked to the root *hrev \\"tree\\", whereas Johann Kaspar Zeuss linked it to *haru \\"sword\\"; * Sylwiusz Mikucki connected it with Old-Indian ≈°arv- \\"strike\\"; * Pavel Jozef ≈†af√°rik derived it from xr—äb—ät—ä, xrib—ät—ä, xrib—ä \\"ridge, highlanders\\", whereas Franz Miklosich said it derived from hr—äv (hr≈≠v) \\"dance\\"; * ƒêuro Daniƒçiƒá considered its root to be *sar- \\"guard, protect\\"; * Fyodor Braun saw the German Harfada (Harva√∞a fj√∂llum from Hervarar saga ok Hei√∞reks), which would be the German name of the Carpathian Mountains, as the origin of an intermediate form Harvata; * Rudolf Much connected it to a Proto- Germanic word hruvat- \\"horned\\", or ‚Äì and Z. Go≈ÇƒÖb proposed ‚Äì \\"warriors clad with horn-armor\\", as a self-designation; * Henry Hoyle Howorth, J. B. Bury, Henri Gr√©goire, considered that it derives from the personal name of Kubrat, the leader of the Bulgars and founder of Old Great Bulgaria. The 20th century gave rise to many new theories regarding the origin of the name of the Croats: * A. I. Sobolevski derived it from the Iranian words hu- \\"good\\", ravah- \\"space, freedom\\" and suffix -at-; * Grigoriƒ≠ Andreevich Il πinskiƒ≠ derived it from *kher- \\"cut\\", as seen in the Greek word k√°rkharos \\"sharp\\", kharah \\"tough, sharp\\", and xorbr—ä \\"brave\\"; * Hermann Hirt saw a connection with the name of a Germanic tribe Harudes (ŒßŒ±œÅŒø·ø¶Œ¥ŒµœÇ); * Leopold Geitler, Josef Perwolf, Aleksander Br√ºckner, Tadeusz Lehr-Sp≈Çawi≈Ñski and Heinz Schuster-≈†ewc linked the root hrv- to Slovak charviti sa \\"to oppose, defend\\" or via sk—ärv-/x—ärv- to the Lithuanian ≈°√°rvas \\"armor\\" and ≈°arv√∫otas \\"armed, cuirassier\\", with suffix -at emphasizing the characteristic, giving the meaning of a \\"well armed man, soldier\\"; * Karel O≈°tir considered valid a connection with an unspecified Thraco-Illyrian word x—ärvata- \\"hill\\"; * Max Vasmer first considered it as a loanword from Old-Iranian, *(f≈°u-)haurvatƒÅ- \\"shepherd, cattle guardian\\" (formed of Avestan pasu- \\"cattle\\" and verb haurvaiti \\"guard\\"), later also from Old-Iranian hu-urvatha- \\"friend\\" (also accepted by N. Zupaniƒç). * Niko Zupaniƒç additionally proposed Lezgian origin from Xhurava (community) and plural suffix -th, meaning \\"municipalities, communities\\". * M. Budimir saw in the name a reflexion of Indo-European *skwos \\"gray, grayish\\", which in Lithuanian gives ≈°irvas; * S. K. Sakaƒç linked it with the Avestan name Harahvaitƒ´, which once signified the southwestern part of modern Afghanistan, the province Arachosia. \\"Arachosia\\" is the Latinized form of Ancient Greek ·ºàœÅŒ±œáœâœÉŒØŒ± (Arachos√≠ƒÅ), in Old Persian inscriptions, the region is referred to as ' ().\\"The same region appears in the Avestan VidƒìvdƒÅt (1.12) under the indigenous dialect form - (whose -axva- is typical non-Avestan).\\" In Indo- Iranian it actually means \\"one that pours into ponds\\", which derives from the name of the Sarasvati River of Rigveda. However, although the somewhat suggestive similarity, the connection to the name of Arachosia is etymologically incorrect; * G. Vernadsky considered a connection to the Chorasm√≠ from Khwarezm, while F. Dvornik a link to the Krevatades or Krevatas located in the Caucasus mentioned in the De Ceremoniis (tenth century). * V. Miller saw in the Croatian name the Iranian hvar- \\"sun\\" and va- \\"bed\\", while P. Tedesco had a similar interpretation from Iranian huravant \\"sunny\\"; * Otto Kronsteiner suggested it might be derived from Tatar-Bashkir *chr \\"free\\" and *vata \\"to fight, to wage war\\"; * Stanis≈Çaw Rospond derived it from Proto- Slavic *chorb- + suffix -r—ä in the meaning of \\"brave\\"; * Oleg Trubachyov derived it from *xar-va(n)t (feminine, rich in women, ruled by women), which derived from the etymology of Sarmatians name, the Indo-Aryan *sar-ma(n)t \\"feminine\\", in both Indo-Iranian adjective suffix -ma(n)t/wa(n)t, and Indo- Aryan and the Indo-Iranian *sar- \\"woman\\", which in Iranian gives *har-. Among them were most taken into account the Germanic derivation from the Carpathian Mountains which is now considered as obsolete; the Slavic derivation about \\"well armed man\\" indicating that they stood out from the other Slavs in terms of weapons and armour, but it is not convincing because no other Slavic tribe is named after the objects of material culture and etymologically was a Lithuanian borrowing from Middle High German sarwes; and the prevailing Iranian derivations, Vasmer's *(f≈°u-)haurvatƒÅ- (\\"cattle guardian\\") and Trubachyov's *xar-va(n)t (feminine, rich in women, ruled by women). While linguists and historians agreed or with Vasmer's or Trubachyov's derivation, according to Tadeusz Lehr-Sp≈Çawi≈Ñski and Radoslav Katiƒçiƒá the Iranian theses doesn't entirely fit with the Croatian ethnonym, as according to them, the original plural form was Hr—ävate not H—ärvate, and the vowel \\"a\\" in the Iranian harvat- is short, while in the Slavic Hr—ävate it is long among others. Katiƒçiƒá concluded that of all the etymological considerations the Iranian is the least unlikely. Ranko Matasoviƒá also considered it of Iranian origin, but besides confirming original forms as *X—ärv√°t—ä (sl.) and *X—ärvate (pl.), dismissed Trubachyov's derivation because was semantically and historically completely unfounded, and concluded that the only derivation which met the criteria of adaptation of Iranian language forms to Proto-Slavic, as well as historical and semantical plausibility, it is the Vasmer's assumption but with some changes, as the Proto-Slavic *X—ärvat- < *XurwƒÅt- comes from Proto-Ossetian / Alanian *xurv√¶t- or *xurvƒÅt-, in the meaning of \\"one who guards\\" (\\"guardian, protector\\"), which was borrowed before the 7th century, and possibly was preserved as a noun in Old Polish charwat (guard). The Medieval Latin C(h)roatae and Greek form Khr≈çb√°toi are adaptations of Western South Slavic plural pronunciation *X…ôrwate from late 8th and early 9th century, and came to Greek via Frankish source. To the Proto-Slavic singular form are closest Old Russian xorvaty (*x—ärvaty) and German-Lusatian Curuuadi from 11th and 12th century sources, while the old plural form *X—ärvate is correctly reflected in Old Russian Xrovate, Xrvate, Church Slavonic xar—åvate and Old Croatian Hrvate. The form Charv√°t in Old Czech came from Croatian-Chakavian or Old Polish (Charwaty) language. The Croatian ethnonym HrÃÄvƒÅt (sl.) and Hrv√°ti (pl.) in the Kajkavian dialect also appear in the form Horvat and Horvati, while in the Chakavian dialect in the form Harvat and Harvati. Distribution Croatian place names can be found in northern Slavic regions such as Moravia (Czech Republic) and Slovakia, Poland, along the river Saale in Germany, in Austria and Slovenia, and in the south in Greece, Albania among others. In Germany along Saale river there were Chruuati near Halle) in 901 AD, Chruuati in 981 AD, Chruazis in 1012 AD, Churbate in 1055 AD, Grawat in 1086 AD, Curewate (now Korbetha), Gro√ükorbetha (Curuvadi and Curuuuati 881-899 AD) and Kleinkorbetha, and Korbetha west of Leipzig; In Moravia are Charwath, or Charvaty near Olomouc, in Slovakia are Chorvaty and Chrov√°tice near Varadka.

San Clemente del Tuy√∫ is an Argentine town in the Partido de la Costa district of the Province of Buenos Aires. History Noticed by Ferdinand Magellan in 1520, who gave nearby Cape San Antonio its name, Spanish authorities first surveyed the area in 1580. Led by reformist Governor Hernando Arias de Saavedra, his Guaran√≠ staff christened the spot Rinc√≥n del Tuy√∫ (\\"muddy corner\\"). First mapped by British Jesuit Thomas Falkner in 1744, the neighboring stream was named San Clemente by Spanish Jesuit Jos√© Cardiel. The San Antonio lighthouse, built in 1890.Dunes on the San Clemente del Tuy√∫ shore. The waterfront area was soon purchased by the Ortiz de Rozas family, one of Argentina's most well-established landowners. Sold to another prominent family, the Leloirs, in 1816, the area became a sheep ranch. A descendant of the Ortiz de Rozas', General Juan Manuel de Rosas, had the area incorporated into a district of the Province of Buenos Aires in 1825, the area's first assigned jurisdiction since national independence in 1816; as governor, Rosas brutally repressed a local insurrection in 1839 against his repressive rule. Following Rosas' 1852 overthrow, the area was given a county seat (Mar del Tuy√∫) in 1864 and, with the arrival of abattoirs, the government had fishermen's docks, a canal between San Clemente and Buenos Aires, a railhead and two lighthouses built between 1878 and 1902. Prospering during the 1920s, the Argentine middle class first became widely aware of the idyllic coast through the efforts of Mayor Jorge Gibson, who had the local coastline graded into public beaches. The project's success led to the first gravel road into San Clemente in 1932 and its formal designation as a municipality; soon followed service stations, campgrounds, real estate developments, a power plant and even a monastery. President Juan Per√≥n made plans for a nearby submarine base that, though never built, resulted in a four-lane highway into San Clemente. This and continuing national prosperity led to the town's rapid development after 1950, which led to the establishment of a hospital in 1970 and of Mundo Marino in 1979, still the largest oceanarium in South America.Go South America A nature theme park (Parque Bah√≠a Aventura) opened in 1997; drawing few crowds, the area was slated for closure when, in 2003, mineral hot springs were discovered at the spot. County Mayor Juan de Jes√∫s set aside part of Bah√≠a Aventura and opened Termas Marinas, today one of Argentina's most popular hot springs. Tapera of L√≤pez: 1922: is there installed the young marriage formed by Manuel L√≥pez and Magdalena Luero. Manuel was engaged in fishing and fish salting built there, in that place they had 12 children. The city today San Clemente del Tuy√∫, the northernmost among seven sea-side communities in the Partido de la Costa district, today counts 27 hotels (of which 14 are three or four-star establishments). The aquarium, adventure park and hot springs are complemented by two natural sciences museums, fishing boat tours and the 129 meter (400 feet) -long pier, among other parks and attractions. Punta Rasa, at the northern end of the city and the cape, was made a nature preserve in 1997. The activity around fishing boat tours centers around the black corvine feast held annually since 1966, towards December. The area's vast dunes also set the stage for the annual Enduro competition held here every February since 1998. A small but loyal contingent of visitors also arrives seasonally from San Clemente, California, a sister city of San Clemente del Tuy√∫ since 1969.

When water-soluble gases such as anesthetic agent N2O (nitrous oxide) are breathed in large quantities they can be dissolved in body fluids rapidly. This leads to a temporary increase in both the concentrations and partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the alveolus. The effect is named for Bernard Raymond Fink (1914‚Äì2000), whose 1955 paper first explained it. When a patient is recovering from N2O anaesthesia, large quantities of this gas cross from the blood into the alveolus (down its concentration gradient) and so for a short period of time, the O2 and CO2 in the alveolus are diluted by this gas. A sufficiently large decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen leads to hypoxia. The decrease in CO2 pressure can also potentiate this effect when ventilation is suppressed, leading to potential hypoxaemia. Nonetheless, this effect only lasts a couple of minutes and hypoxia can be avoided by increasing the fractional inspired oxygen concentration when recovering from N2O anaesthesia. It is for this reason that Entonox, a 50:50 combination of nitrous oxide and oxygen, is suitable for use by para-medical staff such as ambulance officers: it provides sufficient nitrous oxide for pain relief with sufficient oxygen to avoid hypoxia.

With its head office located in Melbourne, Victoria, the company also has offices in Sydney and Brisbane. Over the past twenty years, Grocon has delivered four of Australia's five tallest buildings. Three generations of the Grollo family have been involved in managing the company. Grocon has an extensive history of industrial disputes in Australia, particularly with the CFMEU including on- going litigation. History Grocon grew from a small family concreting business established in Victoria, by Luigi Grollo after he emigrated from Treviso in Italy in 1928. A one-man operation, Luigi Grollo set up his own business in 1948 and completed small concreting projects, such as paving, shopping centre car parks, sewerage infrastructure and swimming pools. His sons Rino and Bruno Grollo joined the business at the age of 15. The business expanded rapidly in the 1950s by continuing with concreting of municipal swimming pools and petrol stations in Melbourne. In the years following, the Grollo Group would transition from the building of local community assets throughout the 1960s to constructing landmark developments. In the 1970s, Grocon moved into concrete construction, such as shopping centres and high- rise buildings and started developing the projects themselves. It was also during the 1970s that Luigi Grollo handed the company over to his two sons and the business continued to rapidly expand. In 1975, Grocon moved to Darwin for 18 months after winning a large contract for rebuilding after Cyclone Tracy. This contract involved the construction of 400 houses for the government. Following this, the Grollo Group went on to develop buildings and operate businesses in a wide cross-section of industries, including commercial, residential, industrial, education, retail, sporting and tourism. In the 1980s, many developments owned by the Grollo family were sold. This included the selling of such assets as The Hyatt, Shell Corner, 200 Queen Street and a suite of shopping centres. At this stage, the Grollo family only retained one major development ‚Äì the Rialto Towers. In 2000, the construction business was split between a construction-centric business owned by Bruno and Daniel Grollo and a property development operation owned by Rino Grollo. As part of this shift, Rino Grollo secured Equiset and the Grollo Group (including its family properties). In 1999, Bruno's oldest son, Daniel, assumed control of Grocon as chief executive officer. Daniel Grollo has since been appointed chairman of the Green Building Council of Australia. and the Prime Minister's Business Advisory Council. In March 2012 the construction business was split again into a construction business, owned by Daniel Grollo, which is the current Grocon, and a property development business owned by his older siblings Adam and Leeanna. In 2014, Grocon achieved another milestone, being named as the ‚Äúpreferred developer‚Äù for the 2018 Commonwealth Games Village on the Gold Coast, Queensland. On 24 February 2014, Deputy Chief Executive Officer Carolyn Viney succeeded Daniel Grollo as Chief Executive Officer of Grocon. Daniel assumed the role of Executive Chairman whilst retaining full oversight and ownership of the business. UBS Grocon Real Estate In December 2013, Grocon launched a five-year, $10 billion joint venture with Swiss investment bank UBS. The joint venture has created UBS Grocon Real Estate, a full-service real estate and asset management platform which has first right of refusal for Grocon's 2 billion development pipeline. The venture is chaired by John A. Fraser, Chairman and CEO Global Asset Management at UBS AG and Daniel Grollo will act as a Non-Executive Director. Awards and accolades As a company, Grocon has been the recipient of numerous awards. In 2010, Grocon was named the Forest Stewardship Council Developer of the Year. and Grocon was also the National Master Builders Association Builder of the Year in 2011. Grocon received two The National Association of Women in Construction awards in 2013 for both outstanding and young achievement. In 2011, Grocon was the recipient of the ANZ‚ÄìBRW Excellence in Community Practices prize. In the realm of safety, Grocon won the 2008 Safe Work Australia Best workplace health and safety management system award and received the WorkSafe Victoria OHS Management System of the Year prize. Industrial disputes Since 2002, Grocon has been involved in conflict the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) over the CFMEU's rights at Grocon developments including occupational health and safety management, union access and the wearing of union badges. This culminated in the CFMEU's picketing of at least one entrance to the Emporium development which resulted in an impassable physical barrier, preventing access to the site through that entrance for Grocon workers. Grocon subsequently launched a 10.5 million compensation claim in the Supreme Court of Victoria for the blockade. It also sought contempt orders against the union for allegedly breaching two Supreme Court injunctions that ordered an end to the blockade. Justice Cavanough held that free access to the site for Grocon workers was prevented by the CFMEU as access could only be obtained through 'elaborate' police assistance. The Fair Work Building and Construction (the relevant regulatory body) has subsequently also launched legal proceedings against the CFMEU. In June, 2015 a court-ordered judgment was made, which saw the CFMEU ordered to pay Grocon $3.5 million in damages. Swanston Street wall incident On 28 March 2013, during wind gusts of up to , a brick wall on the boundary of a Grocon development collapsed killing three people. The wall's safety, the role of the billboards Grocon had attached to the structure and the self-supporting nature of the structure designed by the previous owner were initially questioned as possible causes. The billboard extended one metre above the wall and was suggested to have acted as a sail. There was early speculation as to the role of the advertising hoarding and whether a permit had been granted or whether a permit was needed. There were also questions surrounding the role of tree roots in destabilising the wall. An unidentified spokesperson for the Victorian Government asked unions not to block productivity over the case. WorkSafe Victoria filed criminal charges against Grocon and Aussie Signs who were employed by Grocon to construct the billboard. Police acting in the case have stated that Grocon representatives refused to give evidence, and the company did not release an engineering report the court has asked for access to, saying it \\"was not relevant\\". In November 2014 Grocon was fined $250,000 in the Magistrates Court by Magistrate Charlie Rozencwajg after it pleaded guilty to a \\"single workplace safety charge\\" \\"... relating to the risk posed by the wall, rather than causing it to fall down.\\". Alleged sabotage Grocon experienced two fires on separate Victorian construction sites, and various other acts of suspected sabotage in June 2014.

It was one of three Universalist seminaries founded in America during the nineteenth century. (The others were the Theological School of St. Lawrence University and the Ryder Divinity School at Lombard College.) During its history, it granted 281 Bachelor of Divinity degrees (some in Religious education), 152 bachelor of sacred theology degrees, and two masters of religious education for a total of 435 degrees. The name changed multiple times. Founded as \\"Tufts College Divinity School\\", it became \\"Crane Theological School\\" in 1906 upon Albert Crane's gift of $100,000 in 1906 in honor of his father, Thomas. In 1925, the school became officially the \\"Tufts College School of Religion - Crane Theological School,\\" after extensive discussions, including a conference with the widow of Albert Crane. By the 1960s, the name had shortened again to \\"Crane Theological School\\". The Crane Chapel remains part of the Tufts campus as the Crane Room. The school was one of the Associated Schools of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences from 1903-1962 and 1965-1968. The school was never officially denominationally controlled, nor was it accredited by the American Association of Theological Schools. History Founding ‚Äì World War I Crane Chapel while still in Miner hall, prior to the 1929 addition to the Crane Building Universalist layman and major Tufts supporter Silvanus Packard founded the school with a bequest in 1869. The divinity school was initially housed on the second floor of Ballou Hall. With the construction of West Hall in 1872, divinity students were offered accommodation there. In 1891, students saw the building of separate quarters for the school with the construction of Miner and Paige halls. Miner Hall provided classroom and office space for the school while Paige Hall served as a dormitory and chapel. Miner Hall was constructed in 1891 to serve as headquarters for the School of Theology and was named for Alonzo A. Miner, second president of Tufts College and the major donor to the project ($40,000). Paige Hall was built in 1892 to serve as a dormitory for Theological School Students and bears the name of Lucius R. Paige, Universalist minister and trustee 1859‚Äì1896. In 1902, the school began to offer a combined 5-year A.B./S.T.B.. Between 1910 and 1915, both Miner and Paige halls became home to the newly established Jackson College for Women, until women were integrated into the rest of Tufts in 1915 and the facilities were returned to the Crane School. Paige hall (at left) and Miner Hall prior to construction of the Crane Chapel and arcade between the two buildings During World War I, the school's buildings were taken for use as barracks and training facilities and Dean McCollester held classes for the handful of students enrolled in his living room for the duration of hostilities. In 1929, architects George, Lloyd and Ruffing designed Crane chapel as an addition to Paige Hall along with the two-level Fischer arcade connecting it to Miner Hall. Designed as an adaptation of a chapel in Oxford, England, the oak paneling was brought from Warwick Forest in England. Postwar By 1945, the school had almost no endowment and faculty. After the 1951 destruction by fire of Fisher Hall, the main building of the Universalist St. Lawrence Theological School, Ratcliff favored merging the two schools, an offer which St. Lawrence rejected. The next year included a fundraising drive by Tufts, although it ignored the school itself. The school then launched into its own fundraising program, although this was unsuccessful.. Closing In 1953, when Dean Ratcliff died unexpectedly, Eugene Ashton, a Congregational minister and assistant chaplain of Tufts, was appointed to replace him until a successor could be found. Shortly before his successor's appointment in 1954, Ashton released a report on the school arguing that it was \\"not in a particularly healthy state\\". He observed that of 151 men enrolled between 1947 and 1952, 80 were non-graduates; of the 33 women who attended during the same period, 14 were non-graduates. The American Unitarian Association (AUA) Board of Trustees in 1959 appointed a commission to study theological education in anticipation of merger with the Universalists. In 1962, the report advocated the merger of St. Lawrence and Crane, and the 1964 General Assembly debated a resolution that advocated a merger with Star King or Meadville, however neither attempt was successful. The lack of funds to continue operation was the main reason for closing Crane. The school operated with a deficit for a number of years‚Äîin 1964 half of the $90,000 Crane budget required funding from Tufts general operating fund. In 1962, Crane disassociated itself from the faculty of arts and sciences to report directly to the trustees. While the aim was to become a graduate school independent of a college, resources were inadequate for even a quasi-independent existence, and in 1965 the faculties recombined. The program would have included an undergraduate degree for admission called for elimination of the combined AB/STB program. In 1967, the trustees finally reached the decision to close the school the following year. A number of factors contributed to the decision. The committee that recommended closure gave finances as the primary reason, estimating $250,000 per year was required to operate the school, with no funding prospects, as the Tufts operating deficit in 1967 was more than $500,000. However, the trustees' June 1967 recommendation for closure cited that the school had not \\"maintained its place of considerable distinction in theological education.\\" Tufts President Hallowell was given authority by a Massachusetts state court to dispose of school funds, and he created the Crane Program fund amounting to $213,000 in 1972 to support Tufts's religion department and chaplaincy, as well as scholarships for students pursuing liberal ministry and social welfare work.

It was released in France in December 1970 and its English version, narrated by Eric Thompson, like the original series, was released in 1972. Plot One morning in the magic garden, after a rude awakening from his cuckoo clock, Dougal the dog remembers a strange event that happened last night. He then takes the train to speak to Zebedee about it (while briefly conversing with Ermintrude, Brian, Dylan, and Mr. MacHenry on the way). Dougal recounts how, after being awoken and greeted by a strange red owl, he had heard two voices coming from the old treacle factory that had been shut down. The second voice, a female, repeatedly says, \\"Blue is beautiful, blue is best. I'm blue, I'm beautiful, I'm best!\\" After the flashback, Zebedee suggests Dougal talk with Florence. At the roundabout, Florence is greeted by Mr. Rusty and the other kids who show her a surprise: a sly blue cat, who introduces himself as Buxton. After Zebedee arrives and tells Florence of Dougal's dilemma, Florence goes to the garden and introduces Dougal to Buxton. As she takes him to the bridge to meet the other animals, Dougal becomes jealous of the attention directed toward Buxton, and suspicious that the blue cat's arrival might be related to the strange event from the previous night. Sure enough, no one is aware that the blue cat plots to take over the garden. Sometime later, after taking a nap in Dougal's bed (which Dougal objected), Buxton sneaks off to the treacle factory. He introduces himself to the Blue Voice a.k.a. Madam Blue (played by Fenella Fielding), who wants to turn everything in the world blue (and everything that isn't blue will be destroyed, while anyone who isn't blue will be imprisoned). Buxton then enters the ruins of the old treacle factory and is crowned King after correctly identifying the colours of seven doors (each coloured different shades of blue). Back at the garden, the gang finds Dougal, having been previously stuck from an elevated platform, who tries to warn everyone that Buxton is evil. As the cat manages to keep them from suspecting, some of the characters begin to take notice when blue cacti start appearing. A distressed Zebedee arrives, claiming that his moustache has gone missing (in the French version, he somewhat predicted that bad luck would occur, when his moustache began itching earlier in the movie). While the group searches for the magic moustache, Buxton sneaks back to the factory again and orders his army to capture everyone. Every character, except for Dougal, is eventually taken and imprisoned in the factory dungeon. Buxton reveals himself to be in possession of Zebedee's magic moustache, so they are unable to escape with magic. Upon finding out about his friends from a scarecrow, Dougal has the idea to dye himself blue (in the French version, the scarecrow gives him this idea). Arriving to the factory, he introduces himself to Buxton as Blue Peter and says that he hates sugar. To make sure of this, Buxton proceeds to lock Dougal in a torture chamber, which is a room full of sugar cubes. Dougal faces the dilemma of eating the sugar, and revealing his true identity, or resisting the sugar, thus earning Buxton's trust. He resists, and is released from the room and given the title of Prime Minister. Dougal takes a \\"tour\\" of the caves beneath the treacle factory, and manages to locate his friends in the dungeon, only to be followed by Buxton. Madam Blue then orders the two to conquer the Moon (and paint it blue, as revealed in the French version). Whilst on the Moon, Dougal falls in a puddle and his dye washes off, revealing his true identity. The pair begin to fight, but manage to make it to the rocket. Dougal manages to make it safely to Earth with a parachute, while Buxton, still in the rocket, crashes inside the factory. Upon finding out about \\"Blue Peter's\\" true identity, Madam Blue becomes infuriated, causing a lightning storm around the factory, and strips Buxton of his title. Dougal frees everyone from the prison cell, but as they escape, Brian tries to tell Dougal that they've forgotten something. Brian takes it upon himself to reenter the factory on his own, only for the factory to collapse to the ground. The group return to the magic garden, and come across a tearfully remorseful Buxton. When Dougal tells the gang what happened to Brian, they all mourn for their friend, causing Buxton to \\"blush for shame\\", revealing his true colour to be white. Brian then shows up alive and well and reveals that he brought back Zebedee's magic moustache. After this, Mr. MacHenry uses magic to makes it snow and Mr. Rusty gives everyone a ride on the magic roundabout. Home video and other media releases In 1970, an LP of Pollux et le Chat Bleu was released in France by Disques Somethin' Else (presented by the French distributor Valoria Films), a novelisation of the film written by Serge Danot was published in 1971 by Hachette Biblioth√®que, and there has also been a French VHS release by PolyGram/Universal in 1994 and a DVD release from said company. On January 1, 1972, Music for Pleasure released an abridged LP record of the soundtrack of Dougal and the Blue Cat in stereo (the original mono soundtrack was electronically enhanced for stereo effect) and a single of three songs from the film ('Florence it's a Lovely Morning/Florence's Sad Song/Success! King Buxton') sung by Eric Thompson. In 1972, a storybook of the film was published by Jane Carruth (24 pages). There was also another storybook adaptation released around the same time by Dean and Sons, which was a different, more kid-friendly retelling of the story with very little resemblance to the original film. PolyGram Video released the film on VHS in 1989 on their Channel 5 label. It was also re-released on the 4Front label in 1993 and by Second Sight films in 1999. A scriptbook, claiming to be the original screenplay, of the film by Eric Thompson was published by Bloomsbury Publishing PLC in 1999, and features stills from the film. A restored and remastered print of Dougal and the Blue Cat was released on DVD in the UK on 1 November 2010. This release by Second Sight also features the original French version of the film Pollux et le Chat Bleu, interviews with Fenella Fielding, Phyllida Law and Emma Thompson, an overview by film critic Mark Kermode and a photo gallery featuring the original cinema lobby cards of the French release.

It normally starts on a Sunday in mid-February. At , it is the longest high speed cross-country snowmachine race in the world. A record forty-two teams entered the 2008 event. the total purse was US$210,500, with $50,000 awarded to the winners. Course Iditarod Trail The event began in 1984 as a race in Alaska from Big Lake near Wasilla to Nome. It was approximately doubled to at the 10th annual race in 1994. The race route now follows parts of the Iditarod Trail, the route of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. It starts at Big Lake and follows the main trail and its connecting trails until it hits to the Yukon River at Ruby. It follows the river to Kaltag before it heads to the Norton Sound on the Bering Sea at Unalakleet and it follows the coast to Nome. Then it returns along the same path in the reverse order to Ruby, where it diverges off its original path by following the Yukon River and its tributary the Tanana River until the competitors finish in Fairbanks. The route changes from time to time; total length has been 1,971 to 2,031 miles since 1993, extended to 2,031 miles in 2011. the fastest time since 1993 was 35 hours 39 minutes 56 seconds by Marc McKenna & Dusty VanMeter on a Ski-Doo in 2012, although this figure is dependent upon route length and conditions rather than being a straightforward record; fastest times have exceeded 71 hours. The most current record time was set in 2016 by Tyler Aklestad and Tyson Johnson on Ski-Doo snowmobiles with a time of 35 hours 35 minutes and 22 seconds. Safety Races are typically run in temperatures well below freezing, and -20 ¬∞F (-30 ¬∞C) to -50 ¬∞F (-45 ¬∞C) air temperatures are common without taking wind chill into effect. Some drivers apply duct tape to their faces to protect against frostbite. The machines are equipped with tall windshields for protection from the cold. Drivers compete in two-driver, two-sled teams for their safety since they travel through remote areas of Alaska. Teams are required to take three six-hour breaks between Nome and Tanana. They also take a 42-hour break in Nome to recuperate before they start making their return. Sleds are impounded during the break, ensuring that they rest since they are not able to work on their sleds. the race had never had a fatality, although there had been close calls.

At first, it broadcast at only 2,950 watts, a fraction of its current power. A few years later, KRMG-FM began airing a beautiful music format, and in the mid-1970s, changed its call sign to KWEN. Swanco also owned the original 92.5 KKNG in Oklahoma City (now KOMA-FM). KKNG also played beautiful music. The two FM sister stations were branded as the \\"King and Queen of Oklahoma,\\" as the KWEN call letters were meant to suggest \\"Queen\\" while KKNG was \\"King.\\" In the mid-1970s, KWEN's effective radiated power was boosted to 100,000 watts, the maximum permitted for non-grandfathered FM stations. But the tower was still only 300 feet in height above average terrain. In 1977, the station was sold to Curtis Communications, Ron Curtis owner, no longer co-owned with KRMG.In August 1978 the station changed formats to Top 40 and quickly came to dominate the market.Broadcasting Yearbook 1980 page C-185 In 1982, KWEN changed hands again, this time going to Katz Broadcasting.Broadcasting Yearbook 1984 page C-193 Katz flipped the station to country music. That put it in competition with 103.3 KTFX (now co-owned classic rock KJSR) and AM country leader 1170 KVOO. As country music listening shifted from AM to FM, KWEN became Tulsa's top country outlet. That forced KVOO to switch to the FM dial as 98.5 KVOO-FM. In 1986, Katz Broadcasting was acquired by Newcity Communications. The following year, Newcity acquired KRMG, putting the two stations back together as they were when KWEN first signed on. It was also during the 1980s that KWEN got a boost in its antenna height, broadcasting from a tower more than 1300 feet tall, with a signal stretching from the border of Kansas to the suburbs of Oklahoma City.

EUF Certification Body  In 2003, the EUF Certification Body was formed, a joint-venture between the EUF and the Austrian Standards International (ON). The EUF Certification Body, (which is also known as EUF Certification International) exists to offer the recreational scuba diving community a unified procedure of reliable and recognised proof of the quality of scuba diving training services based on European and ISO standards. It audits diver training organisations and service providers and, where appropriate, certifies them as complying with the relevant standards. As of January 2016, the following recreational scuba diving training organisations have been certified by EUF Certification International since the year 2004: * Professional Association of Diving Instructors (EUF CB 2004001) * VDST (EUF CB 2004002) * International Aquanautic Club (EUF CB 2005001) * Scuba Schools International (EUF CB 2005002) * FIAS (EUF CB 2005004) * American Nitrox Divers International (EUF CB 2005005) * DSF (EUF CB 2005006) * IANTD International Association of Nitrox and Technical Divers (EUF CB 2006001) * SDI Scuba Diving International / TDI Technical Diving International (EUF CB 2006002) * CFT (EUF CB 2006003) * PDA (EUF CB 2006004) * BSAC (EUF CB 2007001) * NDL (EUF CB 2007003) * IAHD (EUF CB 2007005) * NASE Worldwide (EUF CB 2008003) * VDTL (EUF CB 2009001) * ISDA (EUF CB 2010002) * WOSD (EUF CB 2011002) * Disabled Divers International Ltd (EUF CB 2011003) * TIDF (EUF CB 2012001) * GUE Global Underwater Explorers (EUF CB 2013001) * TSV√ñ (EUF CB 2015001) * NADD Global Diving Agency (S 000513 - issued January 2016) * WASE (Worldwide Academy of Scuba Educators) (S 000577 - issued August 2016) * RAID (Rebreather Association of International Divers) (S 000764 - issued October 2017) * Professional, Technical & Recreational Diving (S S 000786 - issued January 2018) EUF Lavanchy Award On 18 June 2016 the EUF's General Assembly unanimously agreed to create a new award in honour of former EUF Honorary Vice President, Jack Lavanchy.

It was his first album since 2005's Unleash the Fury and the first with ex-Judas Priest and Iced Earth singer Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens. The album also features famed keyboardist Derek Sherinian on keyboards. The album was also produced by Malmsteen himself, who also served as engineer, and was mixed by Roy Z (of Bruce Dickinson and Halford fame) and mastered by Maor Appelbaum (of Halford, Lita Ford, Therion fame). The tracks Red Devil, Damnation Game, and Caprici di Diablo were made as downloadable content for the games Rock Band and Rock Band 2 on 25 November 2008. For unknown reasons, the song titled \\"Four Horsemen (Of the Apocalypse)\\" was not included in the Japanese release. On tour, Malmsteen was joined by Bjorn Englen on bass and Michael Troy on keyboards. \\"Tide of Desire\\" and \\"Eleventh Hour\\" Lyrics were printed in the insert of Perpetual Flame for a song entitled \\"Tide of Desire.\\" The lyrics are about not giving up, and of a Perpetual fire, a flame still burning; themes that seem to go with the title of the album. When asked in a recent interview, Yngwie stated that Tide of Desire was accidentally printed and will be omitted in future releases. \\"Tide Of Desire\\" was eventually released on Yngwie's 2010 album \\"Relentless\\". The eleventh song on the album is spelled in three different ways. On the back of the album, the song is called \\"Leventh Hour\\", while on the back of the booklet the song's title is \\"Eleventh Hour\\". Finally, inside the booklet the song is called \\"The Eleventh Hour\\". On iTunes, however, \\"Eleventh Hour\\" is still spelled \\"Leventh Hour\\". Also, the three instrumentals are handled in a peculiar way, the song \\"Lament\\" is mentioned inside the booklet as being an instrumental with the music written by Yngwie J. Malmsteen, but there is no mention at all of the other two, \\"Caprici Di Diablo\\" and \\"Heavy Heart\\". All of these problems seem to be fixed in later copies of the album. Critical reception The album has achieved generally positive reviews from critics. Critic Greg Prato of Allmusic writes \\"Not since the days of Jeff Scott Soto has Yngwie Malmsteen shared the spotlight with a singer who possessed enough pizazz to truly stand toe to toe with the Swedish six-string shredder...the result is Yngwie's best album in some time.\\" Track listing Personnel * Yngwie Malmsteen - lead & rhythm guitars, bass, additional keyboards, backing vocals and lead vocals on \\"Magic City\\". * Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens - lead vocals * Derek Sherinian - keyboards * Patrick Johansson - drums * Roy Z ‚Äì mixing * Maor Appelbaum- mastering References Neoclassical albums 2008 albums Yngwie Malmsteen albums ","title":"Perpetual Flame"},{"id":"19145684","text":"KXBL is a classic country radio station known as \\"Big Country 99.5\\" (\\"Big Country\\" was a slogan 1170 KVOO now KFAQ used during its country music heyday).

His experience in the burgeoning urban parks field contributed to his appointment as director in July 1977, yet the most significant event of his tenure was President Jimmy Carter's proclamation of much Alaska wilderness as national monuments in 1978, doubling the area under NPS jurisdiction. Friction with park concessioners led to congressional calls for Whalen's removal in 1980, and Secretary of the Interior Cecil D. Andrus returned him to Golden Gate. He left the NPS in 1983. A native of Burgettstown, Pennsylvania, Whalen joined the National Park Service as a job corps counselor in 1965 and became well known in Washington, D.C., as manager of the Summer in the Parks Programs. He was deputy superintendent at Yosemite National Park and then managed all NPS areas in the San Francisco Bay Area, including the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. As Director of the NPS he saw the national parks double in area. Management of an expanded system including vast new parks in Alaska challenged his best talents.

His nickname is El Cordobes.  Career  Club Bertolo was born in C√≥rdoba, and came through the Boca Juniors youth system to make his professional debut on 10 January 2006 in a 3‚Äì2 win over Velez Sarsfield. In 2007 he was part of the Boca Juniors squad that won Copa Libertadores. In 2008, Bertolo was loaned to Uruguayan club Nacional where he scored 3 goals in 15 appearances and in July 2008 he joined Banfield. As a child Bertolo was a supporter of local side Instituto Atl√©tico Central C√≥rdoba but opted to join Boca Juniors instead. On 20 July 2009 Palermo acquired the Argentine midfielder from Banfield. After a season as a backup player behind regulars Fabio Liverani, Antonio Nocerino and Giulio Migliaccio, Bertolo was sent on loan to Real Zaragoza of La Liga in August 2010, with an option for the Spanish club to sign him permanently at the end of the season. He ended the season with 36 appearances and 5 goals, but Zaragoza ultimately opted not to acquire the player, leading him to a return to Palermo. Scored his first goal in rosanero on 21 September 2011 against Cagliari, in a Serie A match. On 29 December 2012 he moved to the Mexican club Cruz Azul. On 8 August 2013 he returned to Banfield, initially on loan, before joining River Plate two years later and won the Copa Libertadores within his first few games for the club.

Biography Elisaveta was the daughter of the Grand Prince of Kievan Rus, Yaroslav the Wise and his consort Princess Ingegerd Olofsdotter of Sweden, the daughter of Swedish King Olof Sk√∂tkonung and Estrid of the Obotrites. Elisaveta was the sister of Anastasia of Kiev who married the future Andrew I of Hungary, Anne of Kiev who married Henry I of France and possibly of Agatha, wife of Edward the ExileEllisiv (Elisabeth), Dronning (Dansk biografisk Lexikon / IV. Bind) Her brothers included Vladimir of Novgorod, Iziaslav I of Kiev, Sviatoslav II of Kiev, Vsevolod I, Prince of Kiev and Igor Yaroslavich. During the winter of 1043‚Äì44, Elisaveta was married to Prince Harald Sigurdsson of Norway. Harald had left Norway in 1030 after having participated in the Battle of Stiklestad on the side of his half-brother, King Olav II of Norway. Harald had since then served under the protection of her father as well as that of the Byzantine monarch.Stiklestad (Knut A Rosvold. Store norske leksikon) Elisaveta was the addressee of Harald's surviving poems where he lamented her suggested lack of affection towards him (no implications about their actual affections can be derived, as this might well be a poetic cliche). In 1045, she followed Harald to Norway, where he became co-king with his nephew, King Magnus the Good. In Norway, Elisaveta was known as Queen Elisiv. The marriage is best documented by the court poet Stuv den blinde (St√∫fr blindi √û√≥r√∞arson kattar). There are no other existing documentation about her stay in Norway.St√∫fr enn blinde √û√≥r√∞arson kattar (heimskringla.no) In 1047, King Harald became the sole ruler of Norway after the death of King Magnus. In 1048, Harald took another wife, Tora Torbergsdatter with whom he had two sons, Magnus and Olaf. The marriage can largely be explained by politics and alliance building. The chiefs of the Giske family (Giske√¶tten) played a key role in power politics. It is possible, that Elisiv stayed in Rus', or that she died on her way to Norway. However, that would mean that the daughters of Harald, Ingegerd and Maria, who are attributed to her, must have been Tora's, which is not considered likely, as Maria was engaged to √òystein Orre fra Giske, who would have been her uncle had she been the daughter of Tora. It is therefore possible, that Tora was Harald's concubine. Tora became the mother of both King Olav Kyrre and King Magnus II Haraldsson.Tora Torbergsdatter (Merete R√∏skaft. Store norske leksikon) In 1066, Harald invaded England, where he was killed in the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Tradition says that Elisiv and her daughters followed Harald to England, where Maria died, as it was said, at the news of her father's death. Afterward Elisiv and her second daughter, Ingegerd, returned to Norway with the Norwegian fleet. Elisiv was to have stayed at the Orkney Islands during this trip. However, the oldest of the sagas claim that it was Tora Torbergsdatter and not Elisiv who accompanied Harald on the trip, which is considered more likely, as Tora was the cousin of Thorfinn Sigurdsson, Earl of Orkney.Blundell, Michael C. 2012. The Battle of Stamford Bridge 1066 A.D.: An Alternative Interpretation)Earl Thorfinn the Mighty (Orkneyjar) According to Adam of Bremen, the mother of King Olav Kyrre remarried either King Sweyn II of Denmark or an unnamed Swedish king as a widow, but this is unconfirmed. It is also unknown whether this refers to the actual mother of Olav Kyrre, which would mean Tora Torbergsdatter, or his stepmother, which would mean Elisiv. The date and place of the death of Queen Elisiv is unknown.Ellisiv ‚Äì utdypning (Claus Krag. Norsk biografisk leksikon)] Children Elisiv and Harald had two daughters: * Ingegerd (c. 1045 ‚Äì 1120); married first to Olaf Hunger the future king of Denmark, and after his death, to Philip, the future king of Sweden. * Maria (died 25 September 1066); promised in marriage to Eystein Orre (brother of Tora Torbergsdatter), but reportedly died on Orkney the same day that Harald and Eystein died.

Preparation  To transform the coal ash into a slurry, coal is separated from non-combustable components and can be fractionated by particle size as well. Coal slurry can be transferred by pipeline or with specialized pumps such as a progressive cavity pump to pump the highly abrasive, corrosive and viscous coal slurry. More than 7 billion tons of coal are mined per year (2010), using approximately 200 litres of water per ton. However, the amount of water required hinges on the surface characteristics of the coal being used. Most coal slurries require the addition of a surfactant to reduce the viscosity, ergo reduce the stress on pipelines and pumps. Recent studies have employed new methods of slurry preparation, like using ultrasonic irradiation and a mixture of natural and synthetic surfactants to improve the stability and rheological properties of coal slurry. Environmental concerns A 2014 coal slurry spill into a river at Patriot Coal, West Virginia. A straw impoundment has been created across the river to try to hold the spillage. Ideally, coal slurry consists only of crushed coal and water, which can be efficiently separated. In practice, the separation is significantly costly due to the large amounts of water needed and wastewater generated by the process.Andrews, Graham F., and Karl S. Noah. \\"The Slurry-column Coal Beneficiation Process.\\" Fuel Processing Technology 52.1-3 (1997): 247-66. Print. Furthermore, the slurry consists also of very fine coal dust that results in a waste called blackwater. As blackwater cannot be purified by a water treatment plant,Shiao-Hung Chiang and James T. Cobb \\"Coal Conversion Processes, Cleaning and Desulfurization\\" in Kirk-othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology Wiley-VCH, 2000. doi:10.1002/0471238961.0312050103080901.a01 it is stored in large impoundment ponds.

Walker (born July 25, 1937) is an American executive. Walker served in the administration of President Richard Nixon, first as the first Director of the White House Office of Presidential Advance, and later as Director of the National Park Service (1972‚Äì1975). Walker went on to become a senior partner at Korn/Ferry International, President of the Richard Nixon Foundation, and is currently the Chairman of the Board of the Nixon Foundation. Walker was born in Bryan, Texas. He earned a degree in political sciences from the University of Arizona, served as an officer in the United States Army in Okinawa, Japan, and later became an insurance and marketing executive. A soft-spoken and affable man, Walker had been President Nixon's special assistant responsible for both domestic and international travel. As such, Walker coordinated President Nixon's groundbreaking voyage to the People's Republic of China in February 1972. Director of the National Park Service At 36, Walker was the youngest Director to hold the office and the second appointed from outside NPS. Lacking park experience, Walker made Russell E. Dickenson, an NPS careerist, his deputy. Walker advocated a policy of \\"stabilization\\", foreseeing that NPS funding and staffing would be inadequate for a continuing high influx of new parks and program responsibilities. Fourteen areas nevertheless joined the park system during his two years as director, including the first two national preserves. Nixon's resignation in August 1974 presaged Walker's replacement five months later.NATIONAL PARK SERVICE ALMANAC; Edited and Compiled by Ben Moffett and Vickie Carson Rocky Mountain Region -- Public Affairs; National Park Service, 1991, revised 2006 As Director, he realigned NPS regional boundaries and added North Atlantic and Rocky Mountain offices. Under Walker, the early planning was done for the Servicewide American Revolution Bicentennial activities. The National Park Service established a plan to restructure organizationally in response to the diverse changes that have confronted it over the past several decades, to the National Performance Review, and to legally mandated personnel reductions. The resultant Restructuring Plan for the National Park Service built upon earlier efforts within the Service ‚Äì the 21st Century Task Force Report, the VAIL AGENDA, the NPS STRATEGIC PLAN, and the Recommendations of the Reorganization Work Group ‚Äì- all of which have proposed significant, substantive improvements in the organization. The plan called for the reduction of central offices and the establishment of 16 ecological-cultural- geographical based clusters of 10-225 park units in seven regions. The first steps were taken in 1995 to begin the change. By 2000, the restructuring plan had been revised four times leaving seven regions, which were substantially smaller than before. Of the 16 'eco-clusters' envisioned in the plan, only those clusters based on older regional offices, i.e., Boston (MID-ATLANTIC REGION), Seattle (PACIFIC NORTHWEST REGION), and Santa Fe (SOUTHWEST REGION) exist. Later life and career A senior partner of Korn/Ferry International, he was the managing director for their Washington, D.C., offices. In late 2009, he came out of retirement to take up the position of the President of the Richard Nixon Foundation at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California.

Briefly, the standard part function \\"rounds off\\" a finite hyperreal to the nearest real. It associates to every such hyperreal x, the unique real x_0 infinitely close to it, i.e. x-x_0 is infinitesimal. As such, it is a mathematical implementation of the historical concept of adequality introduced by Pierre de Fermat,Karin Usadi Katz and Mikhail G. Katz (2011) A Burgessian Critique of Nominalistic Tendencies in Contemporary Mathematics and its Historiography. Foundations of Science. See arxiv. The authors refer to the Fermat-Robinson standard part. as well as Leibniz's Transcendental law of homogeneity. The standard part function was first defined by Abraham Robinson who used the notation {}^{\\\\circ}x for the standard part of a hyperreal x (see Robinson 1974). This concept plays a key role in defining the concepts of the calculus, such as continuity, the derivative, and the integral, in nonstandard analysis. The latter theory is a rigorous formalisation of calculations with infinitesimals. The standard part of x is sometimes referred to as its shadow. Definition The standard part function \\"rounds off\\" a finite hyperreal to the nearest real number. The \\"infinitesimal microscope\\" is used to view an infinitesimal neighborhood of a standard real. Nonstandard analysis deals primarily with the pair \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\subset{}^{\\\\ast}\\\\mathbb{R}, where the hyperreals {}^{\\\\ast}\\\\mathbb{R} are an ordered field extension of the reals \\\\mathbb{R}, and contain infinitesimals, in addition to the reals. In the hyperreal line every real number has a collection of numbers (called a monad, or halo) of hyperreals infinitely close to it. The standard part function associates to a finite hyperreal x, the unique standard real number x0 which is infinitely close to it. The relationship is expressed symbolically by writing :\\\\,\\\\mathrm{st}(x)=x_0. The standard part of any infinitesimal is 0. Thus if N is an infinite hypernatural, then 1/N is infinitesimal, and st(1/N) = 0\\\\. If a hyperreal u is represented by a Cauchy sequence \\\\langle u_n:n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N} \\\\rangle in the ultrapower construction, then :\\\\text{st}(u)=\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}u_n. More generally, each finite u\\\\in{}^{\\\\ast}\\\\mathbb{R} defines a Dedekind cut on the subset \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\subset{}^{\\\\ast}\\\\mathbb{R} (via the total order on {}^{\\\\ast}\\\\mathbb{R}) and the corresponding real number is the standard part of u. Not internal The standard part function \\"st\\" is not defined by an internal set. There are several ways of explaining this. Perhaps the simplest is that its domain L, which is the collection of limited (i.e. finite) hyperreals, is not an internal set. Namely, since L is bounded (by any infinite hypernatural, for instance), L would have to have a least upper bound if L were internal, but L doesn't have a least upper bound. Alternatively, the range of \\"st\\" is \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\subset {}^*\\\\mathbb{R} which is not internal; in fact every internal set in {}^\\\\ast\\\\mathbb{R} which is a subset of \\\\mathbb{R} is necessarily finite, see (Goldblatt, 1998). Applications All the traditional notions of calculus are expressed in terms of the standard part function, as follows. Derivative The standard part function is used to define the derivative of a function f. If f is a real function, and h is infinitesimal, and if f‚Ä≤(x) exists, then :f'(x) = \\\\operatorname{st}\\\\left(\\\\frac {f(x+h)-f(x)}h\\\\right). Alternatively, if y=f(x), one takes an infinitesimal increment \\\\Delta x, and computes the corresponding \\\\Delta y=f(x+\\\\Delta x)-f(x). One forms the ratio \\\\frac{\\\\Delta y}{\\\\Delta x}. The derivative is then defined as the standard part of the ratio: :\\\\frac{dy}{dx}=\\\\mathrm{st}\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\Delta y}{\\\\Delta x} \\\\right). Integral Given a function f on [a,b], one defines the integral \\\\int_a^b f(x)dx as the standard part of an infinite Riemann sum S(f,a,b,\\\\Delta x) when the value of \\\\Delta x is taken to be infinitesimal, exploiting a hyperfinite partition of the interval [a,b]. Limit Given a sequence (u_n), its limit is defined by \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}u_n=\\\\text{st}(u_H) where H\\\\in{}^\\\\ast\\\\mathbb{N}\\\\setminus\\\\mathbb{N} is an infinite index. Here the limit is said to exist if the standard part is the same regardless of the infinite index chosen. Continuity A real function f is continuous at a real point x if and only if the composition \\\\text{st}\\\\circ f is constant on the halo of x. See microcontinuity for more details.

Johan Cruijff signed Dick for Ajax in 1986, having been alerted to his talents by Scottish club Rangers, who had decided against bringing him to Glasgow in what would have been a notable departure from their 'no catholics' signing policy of the time, but recommended him as an option to Ajax when the Dutch club enquired about Davie Cooper. Part of a hugely talented Ajax squad which included Dennis Bergkamp, Aron Winter, Frank Rijkaard and Marco van Basten, Dick initially held down a place in the team but at the end of 1986 was badly injured in a European Cup Winners' Cup match against Olympiacos. Having missed the rest of the season, he featured again in the next European campaign, including playing against FC Porto in the first leg of the 1987 European Super Cup at its start, and being an unused sub in the 1988 European Cup Winners' Cup Final defeat against Belgian club KV Mechelen at its end,1987 European Super Cup Final, RSSSF but the injuries had cost him the pace that was a large part of his playing style, and he fell out of favour. Dick later reflected that he had not found Cruijff's managerial style beneficial due to the contrast in their personalities, but that he could have done more in approaching the manager for guidance when he had the opportunity. Following short periods at Wimbledon and Brighton without making any League appearances for either, he went on to play in Australia for clubs including Heidelberg, winning the National League Cup in 1992, and also for Seven Stars (now Ajax Cape Town) in South Africa before injury ended his career at Scottish club Alloa Athletic in 1997 at the age of 32.

History  The Bedford RL was based on the Bedford SCL, a civilian 7-ton truck. The military version had all wheel drive and bigger wheels to increase ground clearance. Originally conservatively rated at 3 tons, all RL GS (general service) trucks in British Military service were, at a late stage in their service lives, re-rated at 4 tons without any mechanical modifications; the weight referring to its rated cross country payload weight. The last RL rolled off the production line in the early 1970s, a total of 74,000 being produced.JANE's Military Vehicles and Ground Support Equipment, 1985, page 436 and 437  Design  The RL was powered by a petrol engine producing , although some were fitted with diesel engines.  Variants  Bedford 4WD chassis cab with a chassis mounted drilling rig by Ruston-Bucyrus Many specialist variants were also built; including recovery vehicles, mobile workshops, radio vans and cable layers. The Green Goddess fire engine was also based on the RL. The RL and variants continued to serve alongside the later Bedford MK and Bedford TM trucks until well into the 1990s. The Home Office also purchased a large number of these vehicles, kept in reserve for any national emergency. All have now since been disposed of, many having less than on the clock. In Australia, R series Bedfords were used during the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s by Victoria's Country Fire Authority (CFA). They were built as 800 gallon water capacity, 4 wheel drive bushfire tankers and designated \\"State Spare Tankers\\". Considerably larger and with greater water capacity than CFA's standard Bedford, Leyland, BMC, Austin and International brand rural fire attack tankers, they were spread thinly throughout the state to bolster their smaller workmates. Most were painted in CFA's standard \\"Carnation (dark) Red\\". They were fitted with rear-mounted, British-built Godiva pumps rated at approximately 2,250 litres per minute output.

He was known for his willingness to stand up against the powerful eunuch Li Fuguo and for his mercy toward other officials who had become collaborators with the rebel Yan regime.  Background  Li Xian was born in 709, during the reign of Emperor Zhongzong. He was a member of Tang Dynasty's imperial Li clan ‚Äì his great- grandfather Li Ke the Prince of Wu was a son of Tang's second emperor Emperor Taizong, who was also Emperor Zhongzong's grandfather. Li Xian's grandfather Li Kun () served as a prefectural prefect and was posthumously honored with the title of Prince of Wu as well. Li Xian's father Li Hui () the Prince of Xin'an was a well-known general early in the reign of Emperor Zhongzong's nephew Emperor Xuanzong.New Book of Tang, vol. 70.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 213. Li Xian had two older brothers, Li Heng () and Li Yi (), both of whom served as officials as well.  During Emperor Xuanzong's reign  It was said that Li Xian was charitable and humble, willing to meet capable people of lower social stations, and that he showed abilities to be an official in his youth. Because of his heritage, he was able to join the civil service, and he eventually served as the magistrate of Gaoling County (È´òÈôµ, in modern Xi'an, Shaanxi), near the capital Chang'an. Due to his good performance at Gaoling, he was then made the magistrate of Wannian County (), one of the two counties making up the city of Chang'an. He then successively served as the deputy mayor of Henan Municipality (Ê≤≥Âçó, i.e., the eastern capital Luoyang), the governor of Wei Commandery (È≠èÈÉ°, roughly modern Handan, Hebei), a general of the imperial guards, the director of palace construction (Â∞á‰ΩúÁõ£, Jiangzuo Jian), and eventually the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (‰∫¨ÂÖÜ, i.e., Chang'an). Wherever he went he served well. In 754, while Li Xian was serving as the mayor of Jingzhao, the region suffered some 60 days of rain, causing much flooding. The powerful chancellor Yang Guozhong, who resented Li Xian for not flattering him, took this opportunity to blame Li Xian for the floods (i.e., that Li Xian must have brought divine displeasure) and had him demoted to be the governor of Changsha Commandery. The populace, which missed his governance, wrote a song that included the words, \\"If you want the grain price to fall, bring Li Xian back.\\"Old Book of Tang, vol. 112.  During Emperor Suzong's reign  In 755, the general An Lushan rebelled at Fanyang Circuit (ËåÉÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Beijing), and by 756, forces of his new Yan state were approaching Chang'an, forcing Emperor Xuanzong to flee toward Chengdu. Emperor Xuanzong's son and crown prince Li Heng (note different character than Li Xian's brother) did not follow Emperor Xuanzong on the trek to Chengdu, but instead fled to Lingwu, where he was declared emperor (as Emperor Suzong) ‚Äì an act that Emperor Xuanzong recognized when he heard the news. After Emperor Suzong's ascension but before Emperor Xuanzong received the news, however, Emperor Xuanzong made a number of commissions of Emperor Suzong and his other sons, giving them different regions of responsibility in the realm, and one of Emperor Suzong's younger brothers, Li Lin the Prince of Yong, was given the areas of Shannan East (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei), Lingnan (headquartered in modern Guangzhou, Guangdong), Qianzhong (Èªî‰∏≠, headquartered in modern Chongqing), and Jiangnan West (Ê±üÂçóË•øÈÅì, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi) Circuits, with Dou Shao () and Li Xian as his assistants, and his headquarters set at Jiangling. After Li Lin reported to his post, however, it became clear that Li Lin intended to rule the area as his own realm independent from Emperors Xuanzong and Suzong, and he further intended to incorporate other regions south of the Yangtze River into his private realm. Li Xian, realizing this, claimed an illness and resigned, but instead reported to Emperor Suzong's court, where he conferred with Emperor Suzong and the official Gao Shi () on strategies to defeat Li Lin. (Soon, when Li Lin openly rebelled, he was defeated by the generals Li Xian (ÊùéÈäë, note different character) and Li Chengshi (), and was ultimately captured and executed by the general Huangfu Shen () Meanwhile, Emperor Suzong made Li Xian the governor of Fufeng Commandery (Êâ∂È¢®, roughly modern Baoji, Shaanxi) ‚Äì where Emperor Suzong was at the time, so effectively the mayor of the capital again ‚Äì as well as chief imperial censor (Âæ°Âè≤Â§ßÂ§´, Yushi Daifu). After Emperor Suzong recaptured Chang'an in 757, he made Li Xian the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality again and created him the Duke of Liang, making him of the same rank as his older brother Li Heng, who had already been created the Duke of Zhao, as the eldest son of a prince. After a joint Tang and Huige force commanded by Emperor Suzong's son Li Chu the Prince of Chu recaptured Luoyang as well, Li Xian, then also carrying the title of minister of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Libu Shangshu), along with his colleagues L√º Yin and Cui Qi (), were put in charge of judging the cases against former Tang officials who had surrendered to and served the Yan regime. It was said that L√º and Cui were harsh, but Li Xian was merciful and gained a good reputation from his judgments. In late 757, after they had judged most of the cases, L√º and Cui proposed that those former officials who had served Yan should all be put to death. Li Xian pointed out that the rebellion had not entirely been put down yet, and further, some officials were coerced into serving Yan, and should be treated differently from those who openly embraced Yan causes. At Li Xian's suggestion, Emperor Suzong divided the punishment for those former Tang officials into six grades, with the punishments being beheading, forced suicide, caning, exile, and demotion, respectively. In spring 759, as a part of reorganization of his chancellors, Emperor Suzong removed Miao Jinqing and Wang Yu as chancellors, and replaced them with L√º, Li Xian, Li Kui, and Diwu Qi, giving all of them the de facto chancellor designations Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). Li Xian was also given the post of Zhongshu Shilang (), the deputy head of the executive bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng). Emperor Suzong trusted Li Xian the most, and Li Xian was the most senior among the chancellors, and therefore Li Xian made the most decisions, drawing resentment from L√º. At that time, the powerful eunuch Li Fuguo and the secret police agents that he employed were able to roam through Chang'an, doing whatever they wished in the emperor's name with impunity. At Li Xian's suggestion, Emperor Suzong suspended the secret police agents' powers, causing LI Fuguo to resent Li Xian as well. Soon, the issue came to a head when a horse trainer inside the palace at Fengxiang Municipality (i.e., the former Fufeng Commandery) committed robbery and was captured and executed by the sheriff of Tianxing County (Â§©Ëàà, in modern Baoji) Xie Yifu (). The trainer's wife protested her husband's innocence to Li Fuguo, who had previously served in the same role and therefore was sympathetic. Li Fuguo thus ordered reinvestigations, which were carried out by the officials Sun Ying (), Cui Boyang (), Li Ye (), and Quan Xian () ‚Äì all of whom agreed that Xie's actions were proper. However, neither the wife nor Li Fuguo was satisfied, and Li Fuguo ordered the imperial censor Mao Ruoxu () to reinvestigate, and Mao, wanting to flatter Li Fuguo, concluded that Xie wrongly executed the trainer. Cui, who was Mao's superior, in anger, wanted to file an accusation against Mao, but Mao instead met with Emperor Suzong first and protested his innocence. When Cui did submit his accusation that Mao was flattering Li Fuguo, Emperor Suzong exiled Cui, Quan, Li Ye, and Yan Xiang () the mayor of Fengxiang Municipality, while Sun was not only exiled but further reduced to commoner rank. Li Xian submitted a defense of Cui, and Emperor Suzong, believed that Li Xian was engaged in factionalism, was instead removed from his chancellor post and demoted to be the governor of Shu Prefecture (ËúÄÂ∑û, in modern Chengdu).  During Emperor Daizong's reign  Emperor Suzong died in 762 and was succeeded by Li Chu (whose name had been changed to Li Yu by that point) (as Emperor Daizong). Emperor Daizong made Li Xian the military governor (Jiedushi) of Jingnan Circuit (ËçäÂçó, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei) and put him in charge of selecting officials from the Yangtze and Huai River regions. He later recalled Li Xian to serve as the minister of rites and the minister of imperial clan affairs (ÂÆóÊ≠£Âçø, Zongzheng Qing). In 763, after a surprise attack by the Tibetan Empire forced Emperor Daizong to flee Chang'an to Shan Prefecture (ÈôùÂ∑û, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan), Li Xian followed Emperor Daizong to Shan Prefecture as well and, upon Emperor Daizong's return to Chang'an, was made Huangmen Shilang () ‚Äî the deputy head of the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng) ‚Äî and chancellor again with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi. It was said that earlier regulations did not permit chancellors to receive guests at the Hall of Chancellors (Êîø‰∫ãÂ†Ç, Zhengshi Tang), but in order to placate eunuchs, the chancellor Yuan Zai set up mats at the Hall of Chancellors to facilitate visiting eunuchs. Li Xian ordered that the mats be removed. In 764, with eunuchs resentful of him ‚Äì believing that he was responsible for the removal of the powerful eunuch Cheng Yuanzhen ‚Äì he was removed from his chancellor post and made a staff member of Emperor Suzong's crown prince Li Kuo, and soon sent to Hong Prefecture (Ê¥™Â∑û, in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi) to be responsible again for selecting officials from the Yangtze and Huai regions. In 765, he was made the prefect of Qu Prefecture (Ë°¢Â∑û, roughly modern Quzhou, Zhejiang). He died in summer 766.

The company has developed yacht technologies including JetStick and Dual Guard composite material, and was an early developer of the fiberglass hull. Currently, Hinckley operates service yards in seven locations along the east coast of the United States, making it one of the most integrated boating concerns in the United States. Hinckley‚Äôs present yacht line includes boats ranging in size from 29 to 55 feet. All of Hinckley‚Äôs yachts are built to order with customization of the interior and exterior cosmetics as required by the purchaser. History Hinckley was founded in 1928 by Benjamin B. Hinckley after he purchased a small boatyard in Southwest Harbor, ME. In 1932 Benjamin‚Äôs son, Henry R. Hinckley, an engineering graduate from Cornell, took control of the company. A 36-foot ‚Äúfisherman motorboat‚Äù dubbed ‚ÄúRuthyeolyn‚Äù built in 1933 was Hinckley‚Äôs first boat. Five years later, in 1938, Hinckley came out with its first sailing vessel, a 28-foot Sparkman & Stephens sloop. Hinckley would go on to produce 20 of these sloops, making them the company‚Äôs first mass production line. Straying away from boatbuilding, Hinckley opened Manset Marine Supply Company in 1940 for which he designed many fittings for fuel tanks, stanchions, deck plates, and the like that are still utilized today. At the start of World War II, Hinckley turned to manufacturing war- designed boats. At the end of the war Hinckley‚Äôs contributions totaled nearly 40% of all war boats built in Maine, for which the company was awarded two Army-Navy ‚ÄúE‚Äôs‚Äù for excellence in 1942 and 1943. Hinckley‚Äôs production of pleasure boats began soon after the war. In 1945 the Sou‚Äôwester sailboat was created. 62 original Sou‚ÄôWesters were built, making it the largest fleet of single design cruising boats of its time. During the 1950s, Hinckley began experimenting with the use of fiberglass to construct his yachts‚Äô hulls. His first fiberglass boat, the Bermuda 40 sailing ship, was released in 1959. The last Hinckley-built wooden boat was the 1960 ‚ÄúOsprey.‚Äù Throughout the 1960s the company provided navigation systems along with auto-pilot and electric- powered furling mainsails. In 1979 Henry Hinckley sold the company to Richard Tucker. Tucker hired William Moyer to run the company where he oversaw the development of the Sou‚Äôwester 42. Due to the recession of the early 80‚Äôs, the luxury sail boat market fell on hard times and Tucker made the decision to sell the company. In 1982, Henry‚Äôs son Bob bought the company back with the help of his business partner Shepard McKenney. The two released Hinckley‚Äôs first fiberglass powerboat christened ‚ÄúTalaria‚Äù in 1989. The last of the Bermuda 40‚Äôs was produced in 1991, bringing the total number of B40‚Äôs produced to 203 over its 32-year lifespan. Hinckley became the first American boat company to use SCRIMP technology (a method of making composite material with nearly no volatile organic compound emissions) in its yachts, for which Hinckley was awarded the United States Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs Environmental Merit Award in 1994. Also in 1994, the company first used its jet propulsion technology. The company again fell under new ownership in 1997 when it was purchased by The Bain, Willard Companies for approximately $20 million. William Bain, Ralph Willard, and Alexander Spaulding took over operations. Under the new ownership, Hinckley began to market power boats equipped with jet drives. The company also developed more advanced fiberglass construction techniques dubbed \\"Dual Guard\\", which aimed to create a stronger hull. In 2001 Bain, Willard Companies sold a 51% controlling interest in The Hinckley Company to Cambridge, Massachusetts based Monitor Clipper Partners for $40 million in debt and equity.https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/10/business/10hinckley.html Company overview Hinckley currently conducts operations in twelve U.S. locations. Due to economic forces the company reduced its workforce in mid-2008 to 305 at the end of August 2009. By May 2017, The Hinckley Company employed 685 workers in its boatyards, boat building and corporate facilities in the U.S. Hinckley acquired Hunt Yachts in August 2014 and Morris Yachts the following year. The acquisitions added two boat building facilities and one additional yacht yard which are all continuing operations. Current yachts Hinckley‚Äôs current line of yachts includes seven powerboats ranging in length from 29 to 55 feet and two sailing vessels from 42 to 50 feet (each boat‚Äôs length is represented by the number preceded by its name). The powerboats are made up of three Talaria models, which are offered with or without flybridges so some may consider this six models; two Picnic Boats; three runabouts and one center console. The Talaria fleet was first built in 1989. The present line includes: Center Console 29; Runabout 29, Runabout 34, Runabout 38, Picnic Boat 34, Picnic Boat 37, Talaria 43 FB/MY, Talaria 48 FB/MY and Talaria 55 FB/MY The Runabout 38 includes a ‚Äúhydraulically operated convertible top‚Äù and is ‚Äúall about curves, shadows, highlights, and reflections‚Äù.Hinckley Talaria 40 Jet  Yachting Magazine The Talaria 43 was lauded by the press and appeared on the covers of Powerand Motoryacht magazine and Yachting magazine in October 2014 following its introduction that year. The Bermuda 40 The Bermuda 40, designed by William H. Tripp, Jr., was introduced in 1959 as Hinckley‚Äôs first fiberglass boat.http://www.trippdesign.net/#/about-us According to Jack Horner of spinsheet.com ‚Äúthe B-40 was to become the bellwether for future production and established Hinckley as the premier North American Yacht builder of exceptional quality sailing yachts‚Äù. The last B40 was built in 1991, ending its 40th year of production with the 203rd rendition of the trendsetting yacht. The Picnic Boat In 1994 Hinckley put forth the first Picnic Boat. \\"Many explanations for the phenomenal success of the Picnic Boat have been proffered, but all eventually come down to aesthetics. The sinuous shape perfectly manages to express the two worlds from which this boat sprang-- yachts and lobster boats-- and its proportions are inherently pleasing to the nautical eye.\\"Power and Motoryacht October 2014 The Picnic Boat style was created by Hinckley and is a registered trademark of the company. Originally designed with jet propulsion, the Picnic Boat led to the development of the JetStick. Research and development Hinckley introduced the JetStick, Dual Guard composite material, and the use of fiberglass. The first experiments with fiberglass began during the 1950s and concluded with the creation of the B40 in 1959. Despite much criticism such as the comparison of fiberglass to ‚Äúfrozen snot,‚Äù Hinckley used the material in boatbuilding . Hinckley created Dual Guard technology in 1999, a composite composed of an aramid and carbon fiber, aimed at creating a stronger and more efficient hull. In 2016, the company launched a remote monitoring system called OnWatch. OnWatch uses a series of sensors to track numerous data points on a boat and relay them via a cellular system to servers that update a mobile Web site (it feels like an app when you add the OnWatch icon to your smartphone homescreen). Once you log in, it gives you a homescreen with an at-a-glance understanding of how your boat is doing, from technical details such as engine status, bilge, battery, and fuel-tank levels, to the state of your shore power connectivity.Power and Motoryacht magazine June 2016 The JetStick, designed by Control Engineering, Inc.,Steering Systems was first used in 1998. The computer-integrated design allows the skipper to control and dock the boat through the use of a joystick. To use the JetStick the driver pushes a button to engage docking mode, this in turn disengages the wheel while a computer determines the amount of bow thruster and jet needed to move the boat sideways.Hinckley Talaria 44 Flybridge  Yachting Magazine Boats *Pilot 35 See also * List of sailboat designers and manufacturers References External links *Official website American boat builders ","title":"Hinckley Yachts"},{"id":"19145951","title":"Solar power tower"},{"id":"19145954","text":"225px Caspar Hedio, also written as Kaspar Hedio, Kaspar Heyd, Kaspar Bock or Kaspar B√∂ckel (Ettlingen, 1494 - Strasbourg, 17 October 1552) was a German historian, theologian and Protestant reformer.

During the First World War, Bond served in the Royal Navy, mainly on the minelaying fleet operating from Harwich. Like many artists, London proved a muse for Bond which is evident in his numerous etchings and paintings of the city. Bond also favoured maritime subjects and was elected a member of the Royal Society of Marine Artists and the Wapping Group of Artists. He established a studio on Gravesend Pier in the same building used by Thames river pilots.Banning, P. The Wapping Group of Artists: Sixty Years of Painting by the Thames (Published by Sheridan House, Inc., 2005) During 1956, this pier-head studio became the setting for a number of Wapping Group invited meetings where members could chat to many of the pilots.

Grant Morden, first Canadian ship to hold the title \\"Queen of the Lakes\\", largest freighter on the Great Lakes Beginning Entrepreneur James Whalen began the company in 1909. Letters patent issued at Port Arthur in February 1909 and construction began in 1910 after negotiations with The American Ship Building Company, which supplied top management and skilled workmen. The initial cost CAD$650,000. The officers at the time were James Whalen, President from 1910 to 1924; Irving S. Fenn from the American Ship Building Company, Secretary-Treasurer; and Hugh Simms, Superintendent. The first ship to enter the dry dock was Dunelm, a cargo vessel that docked on 16 April 1911. The first passenger vessel was Hamonte, which docked on 29 July 1911. 1914 marked the launching of W. Grant Norden, later known as Donnacona, a vessel that was completely built at Western Dry Dock. W. Grant Norden was the largest Canadian-built freighter on the Great Lakes for 20 years. 1914 also marked the construction and launch of SS Sicamous and , two steamships that operated on Okanagan Lake, British Columbia.Division of Canadian Shipbuilding and Engineering Limited. History of Port Arthur Shipbuilding Company. August, 1969. Early 1900s The company built many ships over next years, including warships for the First World War. In 1916, it was acquired by John Burnham of Chicago, who changed the name to Port Arthur Shipbuilding Company Limited. During the recession of the 1920s, production and employment dropped. The company was taken over by H.B. Smith and R.M. Wolvin ten years later, and business boomed during the Second World War. Second World War Port Arthur Shipbuilding Company constructed and delivered many ships and parts for the war. These included nine corvettes, six s 20 s, boilers and engines, and many aircraft components. Increasing business led to new buildings and equipment. The number of employees reached a peak in the July 1944 at 2150 employees (the average was 310).Port Arthur Shipbuilding Company archives. 1975. Decline and end The company was acquired by Canada Steamship Lines Limited in 1946. It continued to build ships, including three coasters, two of which were delivered to Chinese government, and six hopper barges for the French government. Major constructions ceased after 1959, though the company continued to repair and renovate ships. The company became a subsidiary of Canadian Shipbuilding and Engineering Limited in 1987 and closed in 1993. It reopened as a repair yard called Lakehead Marine and Industrial Inc., which continued to operate until 2014. Lakehead Marine and Industrial announced its bankruptcy and sold off its assets at auction in November 2014. Grounds and facilities The dry dock was long and wide. There was usually of water over the sill of the dry dock, depending on the level of Lake Superior. The dock pumped by two direct current pumps that could empty the dock in four hours, discharging 1,000,000 gallons per hour. The company had modern shops for mill work, pulp and paper machinery, general machine shop work, structural steel, power and heating, boilers and tanks, iron, and brass and aluminum castings. At the time of its construction, the machine shop contained the largest vertical boring mill between Toronto, Ontario and Vancouver, British Columbia.

He was a member of the Latvian football team at the 1924 Summer Olympics. In 1927 Jurgens became the instigator for Riga Vanderer being formed as there was an incident involving Jurgens playing for different clubs in different sports which eventually led to Jurgens being arrested before a bandy match.How Vanderers was created He joined the newly founded Vanderer (alongside several other former RFK footballers)Squad of Vanderer in 1928 ; others who left with him included VoldemƒÅrs Plade, ƒåeslavs Stanƒçiks and Aleksandrs ƒÄbrams and together with the side rose to the Latvian Higher League over just two years.

It has also been studied for the treatment of asthma. Pemirolast has appeared as a possible candidate for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) spike protein disruption and interference. Such results were ascertained by molecular dynamics calculations executed on the Summit supercomputer. By simulating compounds with FDA or similar regulatory approval, the authors found 4 interfacial molecules that could potentially disrupt the SARS-CoV-2 interface with ACE-2 receptors, suggesting that such small molecules could mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In 1942, the Juge d'instruction of Muret, Andr√© Reboul, along with other patriots, founded the group which in 1944 would become the Maquis de Rieumes. In 1943, the group reinforced itself and was joined by, among others, Jules Delattre, a retired air force captain who would become the commander of the Maquis de Rieumes. It was also joined by some other Rieumois: Doctor Robert Roger (M√©decin Capitaine de r√©serve), Doctor Charles Chwartz (M√©decin Lieutenant de r√©serve), Jean L√©cussan (a retired army Adjudant chef). The year 1943 was devoted to recruitment, training and to the organization of teams in the villages of the cantons of Auterive, Carbonne, Muret and Rieumes. In 1944, events gained momentum following parachute drops announced by radio Londres, and an arms depot was set up in Rieumes. On 1 June, battle stations were announced with the message \\"Messieurs, faites vos jeux\\". On the 5th, two more messages, \\"Le p√®re la Cerise est verni\\" and \\"Veronese √©tait un peintre\\" communicated the Normandy landings. In the night, the teams met up in the wooded part of Rieumes and divided themselves into three companies, one of which was based in the forest of Lautignac-Sav√®res. Towards the end of June, the fuse was lit as Reboul joined the corps franc Pommi√®s with 200 men.

When she was eighteen, she joined \\"a loosely organized group of women who, through living in their own homes, were dedicated to prayer and meditation. The spiritual director of these devotees of the Third Order of St. Theresa\\" was the Jesuit Jean-Baptiste Girard (1680‚Äì1733), whom she met in 1728. She was encouraged by Girard in the belief that she suffered from holy convulsions and saintly stigmata and spiritual visions, which Girard presented as the symptoms of a saint. He visited her often and possibly abused her sexually. Her emotional state during these experiences was described as hysterical. Trial In June 1730, Girard was investigated for abuse and corruption, and she was placed in a convent. She was released in September 1730. The case was transferred to the court of Aix-en-Provence. Catherine was first placed in a convent in Toulon and then taken to a convent in Aix for the trial, which began on 10 January 1731 under the Parlement of Aix. The Parlement at Aix took evidence and witness accounts for almost a year. She was defended by Chaudon. The case drew enormous attention from the whole of France, and Catherine was supported by parliamentarians, noblewomen, and the public in Toulon and Aix. The case was seen as a case against the Jesuit order, and Catherine was seen as a symbol of the corruption of the Jesuits. Catherine accused Girard of bewitching her by making her fall in love with him: \\"You see here before you a young girl of twenty years, plunged into an abyss of evils, but whose heart is still unsullied.\\" When they returned with their verdict on 11 October 1731, the judges were split 12 to 12. President Lebret cast the deciding vote, and he \\"returned Father Girard to the ecclesiastical authorities for his irregular conduct as a priest, and sent Catherine back to her mother. By this dismissal he indicated the charges of sorcery were not proved.\\" Verdict On 11 September 1731, Catherine Cadi√©re was sentenced to death, but on 10 October 1731, she was declared innocent. Her acquittal and release was greeted with great rejoicing from the public. She was turned over to her mother, who was to remove her to prevent chaos, so that civil order could be restored. However, the fate of Catherine Cadi√©re after this is unknown, and considered to be mysterious.

He is also notable as the teacher of Thomas Luny. Life He was born in Ramsgate and baptized on 14 November 1729 at St Laurence-in-Thanet, Ramsgate. He was the eldest son and second of six children of Francis Holman (1696‚Äì1739), and his wife, Anne Long (1707‚Äì1757). His father was a master mariner, and his grandfather a Ramsgate cooper. His younger brother, Captain John Holman (1733‚Äì1816), maintained the family shipping business and remained close to Francis throughout his life. Young Francis would certainly have been immersed in the maritime world during his up-bringing; the legacy of this early knowledge is a wealth of detail and accuracy in his later work. The moonlight Battle of Cape St Vincent, 16 January 1780 by Francis Holman, painted 1780 A sixth-rate British man of war off Dover, by Francis Holman, 1777 A small shipyard on the Thames, by Francis Holman, between 1760 and 1784 Francis Holman lived in at least five addresses in Wapping on the Thames in London. He married, firstly, Elizabeth, and they produced 3 sons; John (b. 1757), and two more sons, both named Francis, who died in infancy. Elizabeth's death is unrecorded, but on 7 May 1781 he married, secondly, Jane Maxted (c.1736‚Äì1790). He was apparently childless when he wrote his will in 1783. Work Holman's earliest works are portraits of ships, commonly commissioned for ships' captains. From 1767 to 1772 he exhibited eleven pictures at the Free Society of Artists, and he began to produce pictures of shipyards and the general life of maritime Britain in the late eighteenth century. By 1773 Holman had taken on Thomas Luny as an apprentice; Luny later became a major maritime painter in his own right. With the American War of Independence and the strong contemporary public interest in the Royal Navy, it was natural that Holman should turn his talents towards more patriotic themes. Between 1774 and 1784 he sent seventeen pictures, mostly of the Royal Navy or sea battles, for exhibition at the Royal Academy. His most notable painting of the American War of Independence is The Moonlight Battle off Cape St Vincent, 16 January 1780 (shown right). Fate Holman died in Wapping on 29 November 1784. Captain John Holman brought his body back to Ramsgate for burial on 4 December in Jane's family vault at St Laurence, where the vicar recorded his death as due to \\"lethargy\\". Artistic achievement According to Lionel Cust in the Dictionary of National Biography, Holman's work \\"met with unmerited neglect\\".The Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004‚Äì2008 More recently, his paintings have achieved good prices at auction and form significant collections at museums, not least the National Maritime Museum. His attention to detail and in-depth knowledge of his subject have left us with a valuable record of eighteenth century maritime life, and consequently his reputation as a major marine painter has grown. His importance as the teacher of Thomas Luny has also enhanced his reputation.

D.N. Jackson, Jackson Personality Inventory manual, Research Psychologists Press, Port Huron, MI (1976). and the Jackson Personality Inventory-Revised.Markey, P.M., Markey, C.N. (2006). A Spherical Conceptualization of Personality Traits. European Journal of Personality, 20(3), pp. 169-193 Adroitness is not explicitly measured by these tests, but rather the characteristics are measured through different scales. Adroitness assesses the ability to regulate your own behavior in order to get what you want from others. It differs from psychopathy in that the adroitness is not intrinsically narcissistic or manipulative, but refers rather to the set of social skills that allow one to work with others productively. In that sense it is closely related to conceptions of emotional intelligence. Tools of adroit behavior include flattery, indirection, listening, circumspection, reciprocal altruism, politeness and strategic reasoning. Jackson Personality Inventory-Revised The Jackson Personality Inventory-Revised (JPI-R) is widely considered to be one of the most psychometrically sound measures of personality. In one convenient form, the JPI-R provides a measure of personality that reflects a variety of social, cognitive, and value orientations, which affect an individual's functioning.Jackson, D. N. (1997). \\"Jackson personality inventory-revised.\\" Retrieved December 8, 2012, from http://www.sigmaassessmentsystems.com/assessments/jpir.asp JPI-R Scales and Test Construction The JPI-R was originally based on Murray's theory of needs.Kaplan, R. M. & Saccuzzo, D. P. (2013) \\"Psychological testing: Principles, applications, and issues (8th ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth What is Adroitness? Adroitness is defined by its characteristics and behaviors. Example behaviors include: * The ability to pretend to enjoy things which you dislike when it suits the individual's purpose. * Changing the way you act to satisfy a person with whom you are dealing. * Holding feelings in check if they might interfere with getting what you want from someone. * Trying to appear less informed than you actually are. * An ability to get the most out of people. * Enjoying being nice to others. * Changing others behavior, without letting them know why or even that you are doing it. Diderot's Encyclopedie offers an early modern perception of adroitness, which in the following quotation is referred to as social finesse. In the quote below it describes the difference between finesse and delicacy. \\"Finesse is not entirely the same thing as subtlety. You lay out a trap with finesse, you escape from it with subtlety; your conduct is fine or neatly turned out, you play a subtle trick; if you always act with finesse, you inspire distrust. It‚Äôs always a mistake to find finesse in everything. Finesse in works of the mind, as in conversation, consists in the art of not expressing your thought directly, while letting it be easily understood: it‚Äôs an enigma that witty people immediately solve. Once, when the Chancellor offered his protection to a high court, the chief justice said, turning towards his colleagues, ‚ÄúGentlemen, let us give thanks to the Lord Chancellor, he‚Äôs giving us more than we ask him for;‚Äù [4] that r√©partie is a very fine one. Finesse in conversation or in writing is not the same thing as delicacy; the former can be applied equally to witty and pleasant things, to blame and even to praise, even to indecent things that are covered by a veil through which you can see them without blushing. You can say bold things with finesse . Delicacy is used to express pleasant and gentle feelings, fine bits of praise; finesse is therefore used rather in an epigram, delicacy in a madrigal. Delicacy is contained in lovers‚Äô jealousies; finesse is not. The praises that Despr√©aux [5] sang to Louis XIV are not always equally delicate; [6] his satires are not always fine enough. When Iphigenia in Racine‚Äôs tragedy receives the order from her father not to see Achilles any more, she cries out: Sweeter gods, you had asked only for my life. [7] The true character of this line is rather delicacy than finesse .\\"{http://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/did2222.0000.261/--finesse?hi=0;rgn=main;view=fulltext;q1=finesse} In general, people exhibiting this trait understand how to get the most out of people, often through indirect means.Ashton, M. C., Lee, K. and Son, C. (2000). Honesty as the Sixth Factor of Personality: Correlations with Machiavellianism, Primary Psychopathy, and Social Adroitness. European Journal of Personality, 14(4) pp. 359-368. Measuring Adroitness As stated above, the adroitness trait is indirectly measured by the second and third clusters on the Jackson Personality Inventory-Revised, or JPI-R. The second cluster is the extroverted cluster, which contains the sociability, social confidence, and energy level scales. The third cluster is the emotional cluster, which contains the empathy, anxiety, and cooperativeness scales. Specifically, the sociability, empathy, and cooperativeness scales of the JPI-R measure adroitness. The Five Factor Model, or FFM, measures adroitness through the extroversion and agreeableness clusters. Comparisons to other traits Adroitness is often compared to both psychopathy and Machiavellianism, as all three can be measured by similar scales on personality inventories. Psychopathy Psychopathy is a series of behaviors that loosely correspond with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders diagnosis of Antisocial Personality Disorder, or ASPD.Karpman, B. (1948). \\"The Myth of the Psychopathic Personality\\". American Journal of Psychiatry 104(9), pp. 523‚Äì534. doi:10.1176/appi.ajp.104.9.523.. Psychopathy is made up of two parts, aggressive narcissism and a parasitic lifestyle, while ASPD only accounts for the narcissistic personality. Psychopathy is similar to adroitness in that the manipulation of others is an important factor. Psychopathy is considered a negative trait, while adroitness is considered a neutral trait. The difference lies in the intent of the manipulation. Psychopaths manipulate others for their own benefit or amusement, or to harm another person. People exhibiting the adroitness trait manipulate others in order to help other people and almost never intend to harm anyone. Machiavellianism Machiavellianism resembles psychopathy in the intent of the manipulation. It does not include the impulsive and dangerous behaviors associated with psychopathy. Personality Inventories As previously stated, adroitness is not clearly measured as a specific personality trait, but is instead measured by different scales and clusters. Most personality inventories have some measure of honesty built in. Traits like psychopathy and Machiavellianism are usually measured as negative honesty traits. While adroitness is considered a positive trait compared to these two, the inherent manipulation makes it almost impossible to accurately place it on an honesty scale, which may account for why it is not more specifically measured on personality inventories. Cognition and Adroitness Because many of the behaviors associated with adroitness are similar to some of the behaviors associated with psychopathy, experiments that delve into the mind of the psychopath can shed light onto some of the brain function involved with the adroitness trait. In 2008, fMRI testing showed that psychopaths are impaired in basic emotional and cognitive functions.M√ºller, J. L., Sommer, M., D√∂hnel, K., Weber, T., Schmidt-Wilcke, T., & Hajak, G. (2008). Disturbed prefrontal and temporal brain function during emotion and cognition interaction in criminal psychopathy. Behavioral Sciences & The Law, 26(1), 131-150. doi:10.1002/bsl.796 Because these functions are controlled by the prefrontal cortex and the temporal lobes of the brain, there must be some problem in these areas. Due to the aforementioned similarities, it follows that people expressing the adroitness trait may also have some kind of problem or damage in these parts of the brain. The cognitive functions of psychopaths and controls in this study were tested through the use of the Simon paradigm. This test measures reaction time based on stimulus and response locations. In the M√ºller et al. study, the stimuli were an X and an O, both of which appeared at different locations on a screen. The participant was required to respond by tapping the right side of a separate screen with their middle finger for X and on the left side with their index finger for O. In the control group, as the task became more difficult, negative emotion interfered with cognition. Essentially, as people became angrier, it became more difficult to accurately complete the task. However, as the psychopaths became angrier, their performance did not change, suggesting that there is a disconnect between the emotional process and cognitive abilities in the psychopathic brain. If psychopaths have trouble connecting emotion to the thinking process, the perhaps those with the adroitness trait do as well. Certainly the ability to manipulate others requires a substantial amount of effort, regardless of emotion. The resource allocation model suggests that negative emotions worsen cognitive performance on difficult tasks because they drain resources that are required for cognitive processes. Manipulation and persuasion are cognitive processes that require a lot of effort due to the number of things that require focus. The art of manipulation requires some element of dishonesty as well as a significant knowledge of both the target as well as the purpose of manipulation, or the ability to fabricate important details. These elements are also required for persuasion. It follows that these processes must require a significant amount of effort, and therefore emotions, especially negative ones, would take resources away from those processes. Manipulation and persuasion can also be very stressful tasks. Stress is known to cause negative emotions, which are shown to interfere in complex cognitive processes. Therefore, people who express the adroitness trait may suffer from similar damage to the prefrontal cortex and/or temporal lobe as psychopaths.

It was created as a commission for Don Antonio Ruffo's collection. It was bought and sold to several collectors until it eventually ended up in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The mysterious tone in the painting has led several scholars to different interpretations of Rembrandt's theme.  Background   Origins  Aristotle Contemplating a Bust of Homer was painted in 1653, as a commission from a Sicilian nobleman named Don Antonio Ruffo, who did not request any particular subject. Despite not knowing what Rembrandt would create, he was already eager to hang it in his Hall of Fame. Don Antonio planned to commission companion pieces for Rembrandt's painting from the Italian painter Guercino. Guercino decided that a cosmographer was the perfect match, since Rembrandt represented the study of mankind while the cosmographer represents the study of the heavens. However, Guercino's piece disappeared for no apparent reason. According to Charles Mee, perhaps Don Antonio did not think it was good enough. Rembrandt later created Homer Dictating his Verses and a lost painting of Alexander the Great for Ruffo, both ten years after completing Aristotle with a Bust of Homer.  Subsequent Owners  In 1815, it was sent to Sir Abraham Hume and he lent it to an exhibition at the British Institution in London. When Hume died, his descendants sold it to Rodolphe Kann in Paris. Kann had a huge collection of notable valuables, but after his death, Rembrandt's painting was sent to other American collectors.  Purchase by Metropolitan Museum of Art  Eventually, it was purchased in 1961 for $2.3 million by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, USA. At the time this was the highest amount ever paid for any picture at public or private sale. This inspired the American artist Otis Kaye to critique the sale (and by extension the power of money in art) with his own painting \\"Heart of the Matter\\" which is held at the Art Institute of Chicago. During the renovation of the Rembrandt wing of the Metropolitan Museum, the painting was re-titled in November 2013 Aristotle with a Bust of Homer.  Misconceptions  There has been confusion over the identify of the man in the painting because Don Antonio Ruffo did not specifically request a subject for his commission. It has been thought to be Albertus Magnus, Tasso, Ariosto, Virgil and seventeenth-century Dutch poet Pieter Cornelisz Hooft. The identity of the subject was also challenged by Simon Schama in his book called Rembrandt's Eyes. Schama presents a substantial argument that it was the famous ancient Greek painter Apelles who is depicted in Rembrandt's painting.Schama, pp. 582-591. In 1969, Julius Held argued that it was Aristotle in the painting by analyzing his facial features, his clothes and the objects he holds. According to Held, Aristotle is known for his long hair and beard, fancy jewelry and extravagant dresses, which can be seen in other paintings that featured him between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in Europe. Held also connects Aristotle with the bust of Homer and Alexander's chain. Aristotle is known to be a commentator of Homer and Alexander the Great, which led Held to believe that it must be Aristotle in the painting  Theme  According to Charles Mee, the main theme of Rembrandt's paintings is the idea of contemplation. The people in his paintings stare as if they are lost in thought, which makes this his most commonly used theme. To achieve this, he picked a white gown to make Aristotle look more dignified. Also, he painted a black apron since the color black represents melancholy. All of these elements helped create a feeling of deep contemplation, which is what the viewers could find relatable. During the 1650s, people were in a state of existentialism after science made new discoveries about the universe, so Rembrandt's theme of contemplation was a relatable subject.  Interpretation   Theodore Roussin, 1962  In Theodore Roussin, there is meaning to how Rembrandt draws Aristotle's eyes. The shadows that partially conceal Aristotle's eyes shows that he is lost in his thoughts. The eyes usually hint at a person's inner thoughts, but the use of shadows implies that there is a mystery to what Aristotle is feeling at that moment. Roussin also mentions Rembrandt's use of various brushstrokes and limited use of colors. These art choices are supposed to imply the different moods he felt while he was painting this piece.  Julius Held, 1969  Aristotle, world-weary, looks at the bust of blind, humble Homer, on which he rests one of his hands. This has variously been interpreted as the man of sound methodical science deferring to art, or as the wealthy and famous philosopher, wearing the jeweled belt given to him by Alexander the Great, envying the life of the poor blind bard. It has also been suggested that this is Rembrandt's commentary on the power of portraiture. The interpretation of methodical science deferring to art is discussed at length in Rembrandt's Aristotle and Other Rembrandt Studies. The author notes that Aristotle's right hand (traditionally the favored hand), which rests on the bust of Homer, is both higher and painted in lighter shades than the left hand on the gold chain given to him by Alexander. He also said that the two objects represents his contrasting values: the bust being his persisting values while the chain is his ever changing values  Margaret Deutsch Carroll, 1984  Carroll suggested that Aristotle is focusing on the ideas relating to the objects instead of the objects themselves. She uses Rembrandt's other paintings with the same themes of contemplation to support her claim. For example, his St. Paul in Prison shows St. Paul pondering what he will write in his book, not solely on the book itself. For Rembrandt's bust, it represents his \\"attribute for learning\\", or his educated past.  Saskia Beranek, 2016  Beranek mentions that the gold chain is a token of great honor, since receiving gold is an old practice that recognizes someone's greatest achievement. Beranek believed that the appeal of the painting is how it engages the viewers. As the audience watches Aristotle as he is deep in thought, they can contemplate along with him.  Nicole Suthor, 2018  There are stacked books in the background painted in a realistic manner, which gives them importance to the scene. According to Suthor, they represent the lingering reminder of a great poet. Aristole's hand has a warm color when it touches the bust of Homer, which implies a special bond Aristotle feels with Homer. While the bust of Homer seems more visible than Alexander's chain, Rembrandt makes the chain seem as if it were protruding from the frame, thus giving it as much prominence as the bust.  In other media  The painting forms the central theme of Joseph Heller's 1988 novel Picture This. It explores Rembrandt's insight on society as he contemplates the value of money.

It is one of the 9 known species of moa to have existed. Moa are grouped together with emus, ostriches, kiwi, cassowaries, rheas, and tinamous in the clade Palaeognathae. Some of the species of this group are flightless and lacks a keel on their sternum. The name crested moa is due to pits being found in their skulls, suggesting they had crests of long feathers. These cranial pits are also found occasionally in Dinornis, Anomalopteryx, and other Pachyornis species.  Description  Pachyornis australis weighed around . The crested moa was smaller than the heavy-footed moa (Pachyornis elephantopus) and their bones are sometimes mistaken for those of P. elephantopus due to their similar structure. Almost nothing is known about the feather pits on the crested moa's skull. It is likely the feathers were used in courtship rituals or to challenge rivals, but no feathers have been found so their color or size can only be speculated at. Distribution and habitat Pachyornis australis was endemic to the South Island of New Zealand, where it occupied the high altitude sub-alpine forests in the North West, particularly in the Nelson area. Crested moa remains have been found in the Honeycomb Hills Cave and other caves in the vicinity. It was the ecological equivalent of the heavy-footed moa in the subalpine zone. While their remains have occasionally been found together, the heavy-footed moa generally preferred warmer and drier lowland areas. However, it is likely the crested moa would have migrated from the high country to these more hospitable areas in winter. Ecology and diet As with all moa species, the crested moa filled the role of large herbivores in New Zealand, where there are no native terrestrial mammals (excluding bats). The only real threat of predation came from the Haast's eagle (Harpagornis moorei). Extinction Until recently it was thought that Pachyornis australis became extinct at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition roughly 10,000 years ago (10,000 years BP) during a period of significant climatic upheaval. In 2012 however radiocarbon dating of crested moa remains from Bulmer Cavern showed that the specimen died between 1396 and 1442 AD, over 100 years after humans first settled on the Island. During the climatic changes before the settlers arrived, the crested moa followed the changes in elevation of their sub-alpine habitats with little change in their population size. Despite their relatively low numbers and limited habitat range, their extinction came later than all of the other moa species. Given that there is no evidence that crested moa were ever hunted by humans (unlike every other species of moa), it seems likely that their populations were too isolated and remote to have been accessed by humans. Instead, it is probable that the crested moa were wiped out by introduced mammals.

This moa was widespread only in the South Island of New Zealand, and its habitat was the lowlands (shrublands, dunelands, grasslands, and forests). It was a ratite and a member of the order Struthioniformes. The Struthioniformes are flightless birds with a sternum without a keel. They also have a distinctive palate. The origin of these birds is becoming clearer as it is now believed that early ancestors of these birds were able to fly and flew to the southern areas in which they have been found.Davies, S. J. J. F. (2003) The heavy-footed moa was about tall, and weighed as much as .Olliver, Narena (2005) Discovery Pachyornis elephantopus skeleton, Naturhistorisches Museum Basel The heavy-footed moa was discovered by W.B.D. Mantell at Awamoa, near Oamaru, and the bones were taken by him to England. Bones from multiple birds were used to make a full skeleton, which was then put in the British Museum. The name Dinornis elephantopus was given by Richard Owen. Distribution and habitat The heavy-footed moa was found only in the South Island of New Zealand. Their range covered much of the eastern side of the island, with a northern and southern variant of the species. They were a primarily lowland species, preferring dry and open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands and dry forests. They were absent from sub-alpine and mountain habitats, where they were replaced by the crested moa (Pachyornis australis). During the Pleistocene-Holocene warming event, the retreat of glacial ice meant that the heavy-footed moa's preferred habitat area increased, allowing their distribution across the island to increase as well. Ecology and diet Due to its relative isolation before the Polynesian settlers arrived, New Zealand has a unique plant and animal community and had no native terrestrial mammals. Moa filled the ecological niche of large herbivores, filled by mammals elsewhere, until the arrival of the Polynesian settlers and the associated mammalian invasion in the 13th Century. The heavy- footed Moa is thought to have been less abundant than other moa species due to its less frequent representation in the fossil record. Restoration of Dinornis robustus and P. elephantopus Until recently it was unknown exactly what the diet of the heavy-footed moa consisted of. The fact that it had different head and beak shapes to its contemporaries suggested that it had a different diet, possibly of tougher vegetation as suggested by its preferred dry and shrubby habitat. Specialising in different foods would have also allowed it to avoid competition with other moa species which may have shared part of its range (niche separation). In 2007 Jamie Wood described the gizzard contents of a heavy-footed moa for the first time. They found 21 plant taxa which included Hebe leaves, various seeds and mosses as well as a large amount of twigs and wood, some of which were of a considerable size. This supports the earlier idea that the heavy-footed moa was adapted to consume tough vegetation, but it also shows that it had a varied diet and could eat most plant products, including wood. The heavy-footed moa's only real predator (before the arrival of humans and non-native placental mammals) was the Haast's eagle; however, recent evidence from coprolites has shown that they also hosted several groups of host-specific parasites, including nematode worms.

A wave of Greek emigrants from the Soviet Union in 1937‚Äì1939 is often considered a consequence of Stalinist persecution of the Soviet Greek national movement. History The 1926 Soviet census registered 213,765 Greeks in the country and 286,000 in the 1939 census. On 9 August 1937, NKVD order 00485 was adopted to target \\"subversive activities of Polish intelligence\\" in the Soviet Union, but was later expanded to also include Latvians, Germans, Estonians, Finns, Greeks, Iranians and Chinese. The prosecution of Greeks in USSR was gradual: at first, the authorities shut down the Greek schools, cultural centres, and publishing houses. Then, the secret police indiscriminately arrested all Greek men 16 years old or older. All Greeks who were wealthy or self-employed professionals were sought for prosecution first. On many occasions, the central authorities sent telegrams to police forces with orders to arrest a certain number of Greeks, without giving any individual names, and the police officers would arrest at random any persons of Greek origin until they reached the requested total number of arrests until the process was repeated at a later date. In all, some 50,000 Greeks died from this persecution. Some sources claim that there was no widespread counter-revolutionary activity among the Soviet Greeks, though there were exceptions in Constantine Kromiadi, an anti-communist of Greek origin, who later became second in command in Andrey Vlasov Abwehr detachment during the Nazi German occupation of the Soviet Union in World War II and Vladimir Mikhailovich Despotuli. Axis collaboration About one thousand Greeks from Greece and more from the Soviet Union, ostensibly avenging their ethnic persecution from Soviet authorities, joined the Waffen-SS, mostly in Ukrainian divisions. A special case was that of the infamous Ukrainian-Greek Sevastianos Foulidis, a fanatical anti-communist who had been recruited by the Abwehr as early as 1938 and became an official of the Wehrmacht, with extensive action in intelligence and agitation work in the Eastern front.Hondromatidis, Iakovos I Mavri Skia Stin Ellada (\\"The Black Shadow Over Greece\\"), Athens 2004 (in Greek) Remembrance In 1938, 20,000 Soviet Greeks arrived in Greece. Between 1965 and 1975, another 15,000 Greeks emigrated from the Soviet Union and went to Greece.

The tenth tropical storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, Josephine developed out of a strong tropical wave which moved off the African coast on August 31\\\\. The wave quickly became organized and was declared Tropical Depression Ten while located 170 mi (270 km) to the south-southeast of the Cape Verde Islands on September 2\\\\. The depression was quickly upgraded to Tropical Storm Josephine around noon the same day. Over the next several days, Josephine moved in a general west-northwest direction and reached its peak intensity early on September 3\\\\. Strong wind shear, some due to the outflow of Hurricane Ike, and dry air caused the storm to weaken. On September 6, the combination of wind shear, dry air, and cooling waters caused Josephine to weaken into a tropical depression. Josephine deteriorated into a remnant low shortly after as convection continued to dissipate around the storm. The low ultimately dissipated while located 520 mi (835 km) east of Guadeloupe on September 10\\\\. However, the remnant moisture led to minor flooding on the island of St. Croix. __TOC__ Meteorological history Tropical Storm Josephine formed as a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa near the end of August 2008. It tracked south of Cape Verde and slowly developed, and on September 2 the disturbance became Tropical Depression Ten while located south-southeast of the Cape Verde islands. As the depression became more organized, an eye-like feature developed in the upper levels of the system. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Josephine six hours after forming. Josephine was located in an area which was supportive for rapid intensification but was not forecast to intensify quickly. Josephine continued to intensify throughout the afternoon as the storm became more symmetrical. However, due to the location of the storm, there was a lack of accurate wind speed readings, and the National Hurricane Center was uncertain of its actual intensity. Despite the lack of wind shear around the storm, the center became slightly exposed and ceased further intensification. The storm was also heading into an area where shear was forecasted to significantly increase due to an upper-level trough diving southward. Despite convection being partially removed from the center of Josephine, the storm intensified slightly in the early morning hours on September 3 as thunderstorm activity to the south of the center became more organized. The intensification was forecast to be short in duration as the trough to the north was deepening, causing the wind shear to the west to become stronger. Tropical Storm Josephine exhibiting an eye-like feature on September 2 Josephine reached its peak intensity of 65 mph (100 km/h) around 8 a.m. (EDT) as it continued to become more organized. However, there were indications that it had already begun to weaken. Outflow towards the north was becoming restricted and arc clouds began emanating from the storm, a sign that dry air was entering the system. During the afternoon hours, the structure of Josephine began to rapidly deteriorate as strong wind shear and dry air took their toll. By the late night, the center was almost completely exposed and only a band of convection persisted near the center. Despite continuing effects from the strong wind shear, a large, deep burst of convection formed in the northern semicircle of Josephine. The center was found to have shifted towards the new convection leading to an increase in intensity. The forecast showed a slight decrease in wind shear as Josephine continued westward and no change in intensity over the 5-day forecast was predicted. However, the convection decreased once more and the low became completely exposed by the late morning hours and Josephine weakened again. By the afternoon, the center of Josephine was only a swirl of clouds, devoid of convection. During the overnight hours on September 4 into the morning of September 5, convection associated with Josephine began to redevelop somewhat, mostly to the north of the circulation, due to the strong southerly wind shear. By mid-morning, Josephine re- intensified slightly due to the redevelopment of some convection. However, the redevelopment was short lived and wind shear again took its toll on Josephine by late morning. The convection around the system became dislocated from the center and Josephine weakened slightly. The weakening trend continued through the afternoon as the storm was being affected by strong southerly shear. Josephine became almost fully devoid of any convection by mid-afternoon and the storm weakened to 40 mph (65 km/h), barely holding on to tropical storm status. Josephine regained a small amount of convection in the late night hours, but not enough to still be classified a tropical storm. Due to the lack of convection, Josephine was downgraded to a Tropical Depression at 11p.m. (EDT) with winds of 35 mph (55 km/h). Since there was no convection around the system, it would have normally been classified a remnant low but, due to the possibility of the storm regenerating over the next several days, it was considered a tropical depression. The next morning, Josephine was downgraded to a remnant low as strong wind shear and dry air caused the demise of the storm. No redevelopment was expected with Josephine as it began to move over colder waters and remain under strong wind shear until it dissipated. However, the remnant low associated with Josephine began to show signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on September 7\\\\. Convection around the system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed. On September 8, wind shear took over the system again. Convection around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more. The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed. Finally, on September 9, wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of Josephine deteriorating into an open wave. However, on September 10, the remnants of Josephine redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system. Once more, the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of Josephine headed towards the Bahamas. However, on September 14, dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely. Impact As Josephine passed to the south of the Cape Verde islands on September 2, outer rain bands produced minor rainfall, totaling around 0.55 inches (14 mm). There were no reports of damage or flooding from the rain and overall effects were minor. Several days after the low dissipated, the remnant moisture from Josephine brought showers and thunderstorms to St. Croix where up to 1 in (25.4 mm) of rain fell. The heavy rains led to minor street flooding and some urban flooding. No known damage was caused by the flood.

Katukov joined the Army in September 1942 when it was formed, though it was later reassigned. The Army's task as part of Operation Mars was as part of what in Soviet parlance was the 'Bely Offensive Operation in conjunction with 39th Army. Spearheaded by the 3rd Mechanised Corps, the army was tasked to: 'advance eastward up the Luchesa River valley, pierce the German defenses, assist in the capture of Bely, and encircle German forces around Olenino in conjunction with 39th Army.' 'Early on 25 November, 22nd Army, with over 50,000 men and 270 tanks of 3rd Mechanised Corps, assaulted eastward up the Luchesa River valley. Attacking along a narrow corridor flanked by forests and frozen swamps, Soviet forces tore a gaping hole through German defences and drove German forces eastward up the valley. General Yushkevich's attack was spearheaded by Colonel I. V. Karpov's 238th Rifle Division and two regiments of Colonel M. F. Andryushenko's 185th Rifle Division, supported by a tank brigade of General Katukov's mechanised corps. The combined force routed a regiment of the German 86th Infantry Division and punctured the German front.' In 1943, the Army fought as part of the North-Western Front since April 21, then from October 13 as part of the Baltic Front, which became 2nd Baltic Front on October 20, 1943. 22nd Army defended the river Lovat, and participated in operations at Kholm, Velikiye Luki, Leningrad-Novgorod, Staraya Russa‚ÄìNovorzhev, and Rezhitsa‚ÄìDvina. It then took part in the Riga Offensive Operation, part of the Baltic Offensive. Since October 1944, together with the other armies of the Front it carried out the blockade of the German Army Group Courland in the Courland Pocket.

Neither succeeded and the church was stripped of its riches including the rood screen. The nave roof was replaced in 1825. The spire was restored between 1844 and 1845 by Lewis Nockalls Cottingham. A further restoration took place between 1861 and 1869 by James Fowler, known as 'Fowler of Louth'. The clerestories and arcades were cleaned and underpinned. A new south porch was erected. The church was refitted with open seats of oak, the Corporation stalls being of the same material. The floors were laid with Minton's tiles, designed by the architect. A new heating system by Hayden and Son of Trowbridge was installed with the boiler in a newly constructed vault. A stained glass window, the gift of J. L. Fytche was fixed on the east end of the south aisle, and another window was to be placed at the west end of the north aisle, by Clayton and Bell, in memory of General Sir George Patey. The total cost of the works was around ¬£6,000 (). The church was re-opened on 5 August 1869 in the presence of the Bishop of Lincoln. In 1937, it flew the highest flag in Lincolnshire to mark the coronation of George VI. Later that year, renovation work commenced on the spire, under the supervision of the architect, Mr. Goddard, who had previously worked on Lincoln Cathedral. In 2015 came a remarkable discovery from the adjoining Rectory garden in the form of two pieces of a pre-Conquest standing stone Cross dating to c950. In form the Cross is of the 'ring' or 'wheel head' type, the central design being of Christ crucified. The type is more commonly seen today in Ireland. The Cross and its implications for the archaeology, history and the early church in Louth are discussed in a major article by Everson and Stocker 'The Cros in the Markitte Stede'. The Louth Cross, its Monastery and its Town. (Medieval Archaeology Journal, vol. 61/2, 2017).https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england- lincolnshire-36070551 The Louth Cross is on display within the church and a small booklet is available from the gift shop. In 2017 funding was raised to fit a viewing door to the cell just below the spire floor that holds the original medieval treadwheel that was used to haul up the stone and mortar for the building of the spire (1501-1515). Substantial records exist in the churchwardens' accounts from 1501 onward for the construction and use of the wheel which was to become known as The Wild Mare. A small booklet about this rare survival is available from the church gift shop. Dedication The dedication of the church is to James, son of Zebedee, who was of significance in the Middle Ages as the focus of a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in Spain.

The vicar in post became the new Rector of Louth and held the associated canonry from that point onwards. During the 19th and early 20th centuries the parish was divided to create two new parishes, of which the Rector of Louth was the patron. From 1928 the Rector of Louth was held together with the post of Rector of Welton le Wold. In 1974 the benefice became part of a Team Ministry serving the newly created Parish of Louth which incorporated these parishes (St Michael's and Holy Trinity) with those of South and North Elkington, Keddington and Stewton. Since that time the Rector of Louth has been Team Rector of the Team Ministry. *1859 Albert Sydney Wilde *1915 Arthur Duncan-Jones, later Vicar of St Mary's, Primrose Hill and Dean of Chichester *1916 Charles Lenton *1928 Humphrey Phillipps Walcot Burton *1952 Aidan Crawley Pulleine Ward *1969 Michael Edgar Adie, afterwards become Archdeacon of Lincoln and then Bishop of Guildford *1977 David William Owen *1993 Stephen Douglas Holdaway *2013 Nicholas James Watson Brown Bells There is a peal of eight bells.

They were rehung in 1957, and the treble and two were recast. Tower clock The clock in the tower was installed in 1846 and made by Benjamin Vulliamy. It had a pin-wheel dead-beat escapement, with an eight-day movement. It was expected to last 200 years before needing replacement, and was set going on 25 July 1846. It was replaced in August 1901 by a clock made by Leonard Hall of Louth. It contained a double three-legged gravity escapement as invented by Edmund Beckett, 1st Baron Grimthorpe, and chimed the Westminster chimes every 15 minutes. The hour hammer weighs . The total weight of the clock is about with driving weights of another 1 ton, suspended on steel wire ropes of .

Yu-hsiu studied in Paris, returned to Shanghai to practice law, was president of a court in the French concession, then served in the national Legislative Yuan, and from 1931 to 1937 was president of University of Shanghai school of law. Biography Tcheng was first home-schooled, then was taken by her mother to enroll in a formal school in Beijing. Her revolutionary activities began with her family, as she refused to have her feet bound or to marry the man picked by her paternal grandmother. Her family sent her to a mission school in Tianjin, where she learned English but refused the religion. In 1912, she met the anarchist and revolutionary organizer Li Shizeng and enrolled in the school to prepare to go to France on the Diligent Work Frugal Study program. The school was the first in China to be co-educational. She was one of the handful of women to go to France on the program. She wrote later that she and Li were part of a terrorism cell which was involved in the attempted assassination of Yuan Shih-k'ai, who had taken power from Sun Yat-sen. By 1914 she had established herself in Paris, where she probably met other such Chinese as Wang Jingwei. In 1919, she put her French language skills to work as attachƒó to the Chinese delegation at the Paris Peace Conference. After the war she met and married the lawyer Wei Tao-ming. She received her law doctorate from University of Paris in 1926, and returned to China. She and her husband established a law practice in Shanghai, where she became a judge in a French concession court.

NCMF is one of the 12 agencies, formerly from the Office of the President which now placed under the supervision of the Cabinet Secretary, based on Executive Order No. 1 issued by President Rodrigo Duterte on July 4, 2016. On October 31, 2018, the Commission, through Executive Order No. 67, was transferred to the Department of the Interior and Local Government along with the National Youth Commission and the Philippine Commission on Women as part of the reorganization of the Office of the Cabinet Secretary.  History  On July 23, 1979, President Ferdinand Marcos signed Executive Order No. 549 creating the Office of the Commissioner for Islamic Affairs. Rear Admiral Romulo Espaldon was appointed as commissioner. On May 28, 1981, the Office of the Commissioner for Islamic Affairs was abolished and replaced with the Ministry of Muslim Affairs by virtue of Executive Order No. 697 with Espaldon as Minister. Under his leadership, the Philippine Shari'ah Institute was launched and spearheaded the translation of the Code of Muslim Personal Laws from English to Arabic, and the first Madrasa policy conference was held to discuss the integration of Madrasa-type education into the Philippine Educational System. Two months later, the Ministry was renamed Office of Muslim Affairs in order to minimize the number of ministries (25 at the time) and simplify the management of government. Other ministries that were reclassified as offices were the Ministry of Budget and Ministry of Public Information. On June 30, 1984, the Office of Muslim Affairs was merged with the Office of the Presidential Assistant on National Minorities to form the Office of Muslim Affairs and Cultural Communities (OMACC). It was headed by Simeon Datumanong. On January 30, 1987, President Corazon Aquino divided the OMACC into three distinct and separate offices: the Office for the Muslim Affairs (OMA), the Office for Northern Cultural Communities (ONCC), and the Office for Southern Cultural Communities (OSCC). The OMA was headed by Candu Muharrif. On February 18, 2010, Congress enacted Republic Act No. 9997 which abolished the OMA and created the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos. Major Development Programs Pursuant to its mandate, the NCMF is pursuing the following major development programs: *Promotion and development of Muslim economic affairs; *Promotion, development and enhancement of Muslim culture and institutions; *Promotion and development of Muslim settlements; *Coordination with other Muslim countries; *Coordination, supervision and administration of pilgrimage; *Rehabilitation of rebel returnees; *Institutional support to Qu‚Äôran reading competitions; *Support to Shari‚Äôah project implementation; *Support to Madrasa education; *Implementation of socioeconomic and cultural development programs; and *Support services program. Composition The main difference between the Commission and its predecessor is its composition: the Office on Muslim Affairs was headed by three Directors, who were appointed by the President. The nine members of the new Commission are still appointed by the President. All of them, however, must be Muslim Filipinos; one female, one a religious leader, the other five each from a different tribe. Section 5 of the Act Creating the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos of 11 August 2008 These provisions aim to represent the whole of the Muslim Filipino community equitably in the Commission. The members hold office for six years, the position of chairman changes biannually, so as to prevent any single tribe from gaining a dominant position in the Commission. The Commissioners The Commission consists of a 9-member body, consisting of 8 Commissioners and the Secretary: *Secretary: Atty. Saidamen Balt Pangarungan *Commissioner for Women: Dalisay N. Macawadan *Commissioner for Ulama: Abdulhadi T. Daguit *Commissioner for Youth: Samer Musa Allong *Commissioner for Tausug: Fatmawatti T. Salapuddin *Commissioner for Yakan: Yusoph J.

He was the son of Claude Gardel, ballet master to King Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski, and elder brother of Pierre Gardel. Gardel d√©buted at the Acad√©mie royale de Musique in Paris in 1759 and five years later became a soloist. After sharing dance roles with Ga√©tan Vestris, Gardel took over from him in 1772 in the reprise of Rameau's Castor et Pollux, in which he danced with neither mask nor wig (then judged unimaginable) so as not to be deceived by his rival. In 1773 Gardel and Jean Dauberval became Vestris' assistants. In 1781, Gardel took over the position (succeeding Noverre). Upon Maximilien's death, his elder brother of Pierre succeeded him as ballet master of the Paris Opera.

He was born in Columbus, Ohio. In the summer of 1981, at the age of 15, Gebhardt learned to windsurf in his back yard in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. Living right on the water, Gebi spent most of his adolescent days waterbound; swimming, waterskiing, freediving, fishing, surfing, sailing hobie beach cats and weekend cruising on his dad's 50 foot all wooden schooner. When Gebi's younger brother sailed home on a windsurfer, Gebhardt knew he had found the perfect wind and wave powered sport to take his love of the ocean to the next level. His Olympic career started in 1984, with the 17-year-old grom windsurfer finishing 3rd in the 1984 L.A. US Olympic Trials; where only the winner, Scott Steele earned the right to represent the US in the first ever Olympic Windsurfing medal Event, which was now part of Olympic yachting for the first time in Olympic history. Gebhardt was invited to be Scott Steele's- (1984 Olympic Windsurfing Silver medalist); training partner and was instrumental in Scott winning the US's first Olympic Windsurfing Medal. In Los Angeles, Stephan van den Berg of the Netherlands won the gold medal and Bruce Kendall of New Zealand won the bronze medal. \\"Gebi\\" as he is known to friends, competed in the 1984 Olympic Exhibition Windsurfing Event, which ran alongside the first ever Olympic windsurfing medal event. Gebhardt finished 5th in the Olympic Exhibition event which showcased windsurfing's other disciplines besides course racing; including slalom, long distance racing and longboard freestyle on the original windsurfer brand board. At the 1988 US Olympic Trials, Gebhardt won the right to represent the USA and in the 1988 Seoul Summer Olympics, in a very high wind regatta, Gebhardt survived the storm and claimed his first Olympic Medal, a Bronze Medal. After the 1988 Olympics Gebhardt turned Pro, and joined the PWA (Professional Windsurfers Association) and started making a living as a full time professional athlete. In Gebhardt's third Olympics, the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics, winning the regatta going into the last race, Gebi ended up losing the Gold Medal by .4 of a point, to reigning World Champion Franck David of France, ultimately winning his second Olympic Medal, a Silver Medal. Gebhardt competed in two more Olympics, the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics finishing 6th as well as his last Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia's 2000 Summer Olympics, where he finished 11th. Gebhardt competing in over 310 competitions in over 55 countries worldwide, amassed 6 World Championship Titles, 23 National Championship Titles and won over 200 events in racing, slalom and freestyle and holds the World Record for crossing from Ft. Lauderdale, FL to Bimini Island in the Bahamas covering over 60 mile of open ocean in 3 and a half hours while kiteboarding with team mate Kent Marincovich. After retiring from his 5th Olympics in 2000, Gebi started his coaching career and coached Olympic Gold Medalist Gal Fridman, to Israel's only Olympic Gold Medal which was won in the 2004 Athens Olympics. Currently Gebhardt coaches aspiring pro and Olympic kitesurfers and is noted for coaching multiple world champions in racing in windsurfing and kitesurfing and including sailing's Outright World Speed Record Holder, Rob Douglas.

He was the younger brother of Maximilien Gardel, seventeen years his senior.Cannabich, Christian, and Georg Joseph Vogler. Le Rendes-vous, Ballet de Chasse: Partitur. Ed. Floyd Kersey Grave. Vol. 1. AR Editions, Inc., 1996. In 1795 he married the dancer Marie Miller, whom he showcased in many of his works. Career Entering the school of the Op√©ra de Paris (Paris Opera) in 1772, he began his studies under his brother's watch. He became a soloist in 1780, but had to give up his performing career for health reasons, paired with the rising jealousy of his contemporary Auguste Vestris, who was a natural technician.Chapman, John V. \\"Forgotten Giant: Pierre Gardel.\\" Dance Research: The Journal of the Society for Dance Research 5.1 (1987): 3-20. Upon his brother Maximillien's death in 1787, Pierre took over as the Opera's ballet master. Assisted by Louis Milon, Gardel went on to head the Ballet de l'Op√©ra de Paris for 40 years, adapting to the turmoil of the French Revolution and the reign of Napoleon. His first three ballets: Le Jugement de P√¢ris (1787), Psych√© (1790), T√©l√©maque (1790) drew upon classical myths and were considered compatible with the old regime. As the French Revolution caused a political upheaval, Gardel created patriotic dances which combined political content with neoclassical ideas. He collaborated with Jacques-Louis David, a painter who shared Gardel's views on showcasing the Revolution's ideas in works of art.Giza, Brian H. \\"PIERRE GARDEL AND HIS RELATIONSHIP TO THE RISE OF THE ROMANTIC BALLET.\\" In L'Offrande √† la Libert√© (1792) Gardel reproduced the events of the Revolution as an opera with music composed by Fran√ßois-Joseph Gossec. It included the revolutionary national anthem The Marseillaise, which was sung on stage. Pierre Gardel argued that strong technical dancing was equally important to a ballet's story and theatrics. He was influenced by Noverre's reforms, although Gardel didn't see the need to limit technique when including pantomime.Chapman, John V. \\"Forgotten Giant: Pierre Gardel.\\" Dance Research: The Journal of the Society for Dance Research 5.1 (1987): 3-20. He kept mime to a minimum and cast those with natural dramatic ability. His choreography offered dancers what he saw as challenging and dramatic work.Chapman, John V. \\"Forgotten Giant: Pierre Gardel.\\" Dance Research: The Journal of the Society for Dance Research 5.1 (1987): 3-20. Outside of the Opera ballet masters were focusing on pantomime. It was at this time that Gardel enabled changes in the training to reflect his focus on expanding technique to encompass great bodily feats. Gardel allowed and encouraged the creation of divertissements for the dancers. Auguste Vestris was a principal dancer at this time and well known for pushing the boundaries of turning and jumping. The very thing that caused Gardel discomfort as a dancer became valuable once Gardel became the Op√©ra's ballet master. The uniformity of training that the Opera is known for was first seen under his rule. Criticized for not allowing outside choreographers access to his dancers \\"he kept them in a type of artistic isolation.\\" (Au 42) Au, Susan, and Selma Jeanne Cohen. Ballet and modern dance. Thames & Hudson, 2002. Some argue that Gardel's leadership was the reason that so few notable dancers emerged from the Opera during and in the years that followed his reign.Giza, Brian H. \\"PIERRE GARDEL AND HIS RELATIONSHIP TO THE RISE OF THE ROMANTIC BALLET.\\" A talented choreographer, he enthused the public from his first productions in 1790 right through to those just before his retirement. In 1820 he began lessening his work load, opting to create works for the operas, rather than full ballets. From 1820, the creation of ballets was transferred to Jean-Pierre Aumer, although Gardel didn't step down from his position and fully retire until 1827.

Later he began studying dance at the Paris Opera Ballet School, joining the corps de ballet of the school's parent company in 1787 and making a favorable impression as the Grand Cousin in Maximilien Gardel's Le d√©serteur on 16 January 1788 and as the Mentor in Pierre Gardel's T√©l√©maque on 23 February 1790.Pitou 1985, vol. 2, pp. 364‚Äì365. He became double in 1791 and was only promoted to replacement in the noble genre in 1799, before retiring as a dancer in 1800. He created his first ballet, Pygmalion, at the Th√©√¢tre de l'Ambigu-Comique in 1799 with his sister-in-law, √âmilie Bigottini, as the star. It was so successful, that he was invited to stage it at the Op√©ra, where it was first presented on 20 August 1800. After successfully creating H√©ro et L√©andre at the Op√©ra on 31 December 1799,Pitou 1985, vol. 2, p. 584. he became assistant ballet master to Pierre Gardel, with whom he worked in great harmony. Their collaboration, Les Noces de Gamache, with a libretto by Milon based on comic episodes from Cervantes's novel Don Quixote, premiered on 18 January 1801 and was retained in the repertory until 1841. He continued to teach and created many other works for the company until his retirement in 1826. Many of his ballets were also produced in the main stages of Europe. In parallel to his choreography career, he was also the last \\"Grand Professeur\\" of pantomime at the Op√©ra. He died in Neuilly-sur-Seine in 1849. Though not revolutionary, his works were well in line with the tastes of the time and perfectly legible for audiences. With Bigottini, Milon put on pieces full of fantasy and humour as well as melodramas, with the latter having great success right up until the rise of romantic ballet around 1830.

It is a selective thromboxane prostanoid (TP) antagonist and is an orally active drug in clinical development for the secondary prevention of acute thrombotic complications. It has been tested in the Phase III clinical trial PERFORM (Prevention of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular Events of ischemic origin with teRutroban in patients with a history oF ischemic strOke or tRansient ischeMic attack). The study was prematurely stopped and it could not be determined whether terutroban has a better effect than aspirin. The 2011 clinical trial that studied the antiplatelet agent versus aspirin found that it was not superior in the prevention of cerebral and cardiovascular ischaemic events, although it was significantly better in patients who already suffered previous stroke to the qualifying event. Researchers from the University of Milan also found in a new research that terutroban can prevent the development of aorta hyperplasia and has beneficial effects on fibrotic processes, leading to the conclusion that it has beneficial effects in preventing or retarding atherogenesis. Method of action Aside from its anti-inflammatory effect, terutroban is a selective antagonist of the thromboxane receptor. It blocks thromboxane induced platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.

His parents were John Green and Bridget (Kenny) Green. John A. Green came to Boston, Massachusetts, September 2, 1852, and attended the common schools. In 1860 he learned the monumental trade and worked at it for ten years. Later he worked in granite, sandstone and last of all limestone. Mr. Green came west in 1865, living for a time in Joliet, Illinois. In 1867 he worked at the Rock Island Arsenal as a stone-cutter, and in the same year he went to Wyoming, where he cut stone for Union Pacific bridges, forty miles west of Cheyenne. He returned to Joliet in the winter of the same year. March 17, 1868, then a lonely spot in the wilderness, now the site of Stone City, Iowa, a prosperous community in the late 19th century that added great wealth to the state and to Jones County, built, as its name indicates, on the business inaugurated by Mr. Green when he opened the Champion quarries. Champion Quarry, October 19, 1895For nearly fifty years, the quarries produced steadily, amounting to more than 4.5 billion dollars in sales. 1896 records indicate 1,000 men employed among the city's quarries, carving 160,000 loads of stone in a single year with a market value of 3.75 million dollars. In his most productive years (1869-1890s), J.A. Green operated three quarries (known as \\"Champion 1,\\" \\"Champion 2,\\" and \\"John Allen\\") using nearby Anamosa State Penitentiary labor. All provided high- quality stone to the Midwest. Green's various business ventures included other quarries in Iowa, Minnesota, and Missouri, as well as mason supply and sand dredging companies in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. With his financial success and a keen eye for marketing, Green soon envisioned a city made entirely of stone to accommodate the growing population (from 60 to almost 500 by 1880). In 1875, he married Ellen Green, of Joliet, Illinois, and to them were born ‚ÄîMary, Anna, Joseph, Ellen and James, twins, Leo, Rose, Agnes, Robert, and Josephine. In addition to the Champion quarries, Mr. Green opened a quarry on Buffalo Creek, worked the old state quarry on the Wapsipinicon River for a time, a quarry at Wasioja, Minnesota, and one at Shuster, Missouri. He was the first in the United States to employ hydraulic power for stripping quarries, and he was also the first to load large holes with several hundred pounds of black powder, to shake the hills and loosen thousands of tons of stone at one blast. In 1892 he was elected to the Iowa Senate from the twenty-fourth senatorial district, a Republican division comprising Jones and Cedar counties. He was an unsuccessful candidate for congressional honors in 1904, receiving, however, 2,760 more votes than were given for the head of his ticket in the fifth congressional district of Iowa.

In the first step, the ions are separated according to their mobility through a buffer gas on a millisecond timescale using an ion mobility spectrometer. The separated ions are then introduced into a mass analyzer in a second step where their mass to charge ratios can be determined on a microsecond timescale. The effective separation of analytes achieved with this method makes it widely applicable in the analysis of complex samples such as in proteomics and metabolomics.  History  Earl W. McDaniel has been called the father of ion mobility mass spectrometry. In the early 1960s, he coupled a low-field ion mobility drift cell to a sector mass spectrometer. The combination of time-of-flight mass spectrometry and ion-mobility spectrometry was pioneered in 1963 at Bell Labs. In 1963 McAfee and Edelson published an IMS-TOF combination. In 1967 McKnight, McAfee and Sipler published an IMS-TOF combination. Their instrument included an orthogonal TOF. In 1969 Cohen et al. filed a patent on an IMS-QMS system. The QMS at that time was an improvement compared to the TOFMS, because the TOFMS had a slow electronic data acquisition systems at that time. In 1970, Young, Edelson and Falconer published an IMS-TOF with orthogonal extraction. They seem to have used the same system as McKnight et al. in 1967, incorporating slight modifications. Their work was later reproduced in the landmark book of Mason/McDaniel, which is regarded as the ‚Äúbible of IMS‚Äù by those skilled in the art. In 1996 Guevremont et al. presented a poster at the ASMS conference about IMS-TOF. In 1997 Tanner patented a quadrupole with axial fields which can be used as a drift cell for IMS separation. He also mentions the combination of these quadrupoles with an orthogonal TOFMS. In 1998 Clemmer developed an IMS-TOF combination, using a co-axial IMS-TOF setup. In 1999 Clemmer developed an IMS- TOF with an orthogonal TOF system. This work led to the development of an ion mobility-quadrupole-CID-TOFMS instrument by Micromass in the UK and ultimately led Micromass / Waters corporation to develop of the world's first commercial ion mobility-mass spectrometer instrument in 2006. The Synapt, as it is called, incorporates a pre ion mobility quadrupole allowing precursor ion selection prior to IMS separation further enhancing the flexibility of the ion mobility-mass spectrometry combinations. In 2013, Agilent Technologies released the first commercial drift tube ion mobility-mass spectrometer named 6560 with an 80 cm drift tube. Ion funnels are used to improve the ion transmission efficiency. The design thus greatly improved the sensitivity of ion mobility and allowed commercialization. A variation of IMS-MS is differential ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (DIMS-MS), in which gas phase ions are separated based on their ion mobility in varying strengths of electric fields. This analytical method is currently being advanced by Gary Glish and the Glish Group.  Instrumentation  The IMS-MS is a combination of an ion-mobility spectrometer and a mass spectrometer, as discussed by Professor Claire E. Eyers and colleagues in a recent review. A drift-time ion mobility spectrometer. In IM-MS, the detector is typically a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Sample Introduction and Ionization The first stage of the instrument is an ion source where samples are converted to gas phase ions. Many ionization methods similar to those traditionally used for mass spectrometry have been employed for IM-MS depending on the physical state of the analyte. Gas phase samples are typically ionized with thermal desorption, radioactive ionization, corona discharge ionization and photoionization techniques. Electrospray ionization and secondary electrospray ionization (SESI) are common methods for ionizing samples in solution. Solid-phase analytes are ionized with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) for large mass molecules or laser desorption ionization (LDI) for molecules with smaller masses.  Ion mobility separation  There are different types of ion mobility spectrometers and there are different types of mass spectrometers. In principle it is possible to combine every type of the former with any type of the latter. However, in the real world, different types of ion mobility are coupled with different types of mass spectrometers to achieve reasonable sensitivity. The main types of ion mobility spectrometers that have been coupled to a mass spectrometer for IM-MS applications are discussed below. = Drift-time ion mobility spectrometry (DTIMS) = In DTIMS, ions are drifted through a tube whose length could vary from 5 cm to 300 cm using as electric field gradient. Smaller ions travel faster through the drift tube than ions with larger molecular weight. Thus, ions are separated based on their drift time through the tube. Drift tube ion mobility does not employ RF voltage which may heat ions, and it can preserve the structure of the ions. The rotationally averaged collision cross section (CCS) which is a physical property of ions reflecting the shape of the ions can be measured accurately on drift tube ion mobility. The resolving power is high (CCS resolution can be higher than 100). Drift tube ion mobility is widely used for structure analysis. It is usually coupled with time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer. = Differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) = Also known as field asymmetric-waveform ion-mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) or RF-DC ion-mobility spectrometry is a mass spectrometry technique in which ions are separated by the application of a high-voltage asymmetric waveform at radio frequency (RF) combined with a static (DC) waveform applied between two electrodes. Depending on the ratio of the high-field and low-field mobility of the ion, it will migrate toward one or the other electrode. Only ions with specific mobility will pass through the device. It is well known that the high RF field distort the conformation of the ions, FAIMS thus is a separation technique without reserving the structure of the ions and the CCSs of the ions cannot be measured. Because FAIMS is a mass selector (other ions are excluded), the sensitivity in the scan mode is much lower than that of the drift tube ion mobility (all the ions are analyzed). Therefore, FAIMS is usually coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometer which is also ion selection type instrument. = Travelling wave ion mobility spectrometry (TWIMS) = In TWIMS, ions are separated according to their mobility through a travelling wave in a gas filled cell. Both radio-frequency (RF) and direct current (DC) voltages are applied to a series of ring electrodes called a stacked ring ion guide (SRIG) to confine the ions and create a travelling wave. Based on the speed and magnitude of the travelling wave, ions can be separated. Smaller ions have higher-mobility through the wave due to less collisions with gas molecules and exit the cell faster than ions of lower mobility (larger ions). Similar to DTIMS, CCS values of ions can be calculated with TWIMS using a calibration derived with known standards. A commercial example of the TWIMS-MS instrumentation is Waters Corp Synapt G2-S instrument.  Mass separation  The traditional IM-MS instrument uses a time‚Äêof‚Äêflight (TOF) mass spectrometer interfaced to an IMS. The TOF-MS has many advantages including the high speed of data acquisition and good sensitivity. Since mass spectra data is acquired on a microsecond time scale, multiple mass spectra is collected for each IMS spectra (acquired on millisecond timescale). The quadrupole mass spectrometer has also been coupled to an IMS, although at a slower scan rate. Other mass spectrometers including the ion‚Äêtrap, Fourier transform ion‚Äêcyclotron resonance (FT-ICR), or magnetic‚Äêsector mass spectrometers have also been coupled with different IMS for various applications. Additionally, hybrid mass spectrometers have been interfaced to more than one ion mobility cell for tandem or IMSn‚ÄìMSm applications. Applications The IM-MS technique can be used for analyzing complex mixtures based on differing mobilities in an electric field. The gas-phase ion structure can be studied using IM-MS through measurement of the CCS and comparison with CCS of standard samples or CCS calculated from molecular modelling. The signal-to-noise ratio is obviously improved because the noise can be physically separated with signal in IM-MS. In addition, isomers can be separated if their shapes are different. The peak capacity of IM-MS is much larger than MS so more compounds can be found and analyzed. This character is very critical for -omics study which requires analyzing as many compounds as possible in a single run. It has been used in the detection of chemical warfare agents, detection of explosives, in proteomics for the analysis of proteins, peptides, drug-like molecules and nano particles. Recently, microscale FAIMS has been integrated with electrospray ionization MS and liquid chromatography MS to rapidly separate ions in milliseconds prior to mass analysis. The use of microscale FAIMS in electrospray ionization MS and liquid chromatography MS can significantly improve peak capacity and signal-to-noise for a range of applications including proteomics, and pharmaceutical analysis. Recently, gas-phase ion activation methods have been used to gain new insights into complex structures. Collision induced unfolding (CIU) is a technique in which an ion's internal energy is increased through collisions with a buffer gas prior to IM- MS analysis. Unfolding of the ion is observed through larger CCSs, and the energy at which unfolding occurs corresponds partially to noncovalent interactions within the ion. This technique has been used to differentiate polyubiquitin linkages and intact antibodies.

Vacancy  The seat had become vacant when the constituency's Liberal Member of Parliament (MP), the Rt Hon. Sir Donald Maclean died on 15 June 1932. He had been MP here since 1929. Maclean joined the National Government, a coalition. He served as President of the Board of Education from 1931 to 1932, when he died from cardiovascular disease at the age of sixty- eight.  Electoral history  The seat was a traditional Liberal/Conservative marginal. At the last election, despite Maclean being a senior member of the National Government he was opposed by a Conservative;  Candidates  *The Rt Hon. Sir Francis Dyke Acland, Bt. was chosen as the Liberal candidate. Acland was a junior minister from 1908 until 1910 and again from 1911 until 1916. He was first elected to Parliament, to represent Richmond (Yorkshire) from 1906 until January 1910 when he was defeated. He returned to Parliament, representing Camborne from December 1910 until November 1922. He contested Tiverton in 1922 and was later the MP there between June and December 1923. Finally contesting Hexham in May 1929. *The Conservative candidate was local politician Alfred Martyn Williams, who had been born in 1897. He had previously been MP for the seat between 1924 and 1929. He had unsuccessfully contested the division at the general elections of 1929 and 1931. Campaign Polling day was fixed for 22 July 1932, 37 days after the death of Maclean. The main issue that divided the Conservatives and Liberals in the National Government was that of Free Trade v. Protection. Both parties were keen to take their dispute to the by-election hustings. Conservative leader, Stanley Baldwin, spent much time in the constituency speaking in support of the Conservative candidate and many other Conservative MPs toured the constituency. The Conservative's sought to argue that the Liberals, who were a minor partner in Government, were being disloyal to it by arguing for free trade.Liberal Crusader by Gerard de Groot  Result  The Liberals held the seat and increased their share of the vote.

Hamodia Prime, December 11, 2019, p. 21}} This concept has applications to the performance of Torah commandments in a public setting, as well as the gathering of Jews to protest Sabbath desecration or other willful violations of Torah law by, for example, the government. Hebrew Bible Proverbs 14:28 is cited to suggest that it is best, where possible, to make blessings in an assembly of people.Gersion Appel The Concise Code of Jewish Law: A guide to prayer and religious observance in the daily life of the Jew. 1989 Page 221 \\"after an interval of twenty-eight years, when the (vernal) spring equinox of the month of Nisan...

One such example is brought by a Tosefta (B.Berachot 53a) which quotes a situation in which many individuals were gathered together and learning in a study hall when a candle arrived for use in the havdalah prayer that is recited at the end of Shabbat. In such a case, either each individual could recite his own blessing on the fire, or one person can recite the blessing and all of the others can listen and respond amen, thereby fulfilling their obligation to recite the blessing. Whereas the House of Shammai proposed that each person recite their own blessing, the House of Hillel proposed that one person should recite the blessing on behalf of everyone present in fulfillment of the principle of b'rov am hadrat melech. The law follows the latter opinion - such as Ayin Mishpat Ner Mitzvah citing Maimonides. Another example is in reference to blowing the shofar.(B.Rosh Hashanah 22b) The Mishna (Rosh Hashanah 4:8) mandates that the shofar be blown during the musaf prayer service, and the Gemara, ostensibly providing an explanation to why the shofar is not blown in the earlier shacharit prayer, provides the rationale that inclusion within the musaf prayer is because of the principle of b'rov am hadrat melech, as more people are in the synagogue by the time the congregation has reached musaf. This rationale is immediately debunked, as the Gemara continues to ask why hallel (when recited) is included in shacharit if b'rov am hadrat melech is indeed governing into which prayers the additions are added.

He was recalled by Oakland on April 20, and sent back to Sacramento on April 29. He was recalled again on May 10. On June 13, Chavez pitched 5 shutout innings of relief in an 18-inning game against the New York Yankees, earning the win. On July 31, Chavez pitched against the Blue Jays for the first time since being traded to Oakland and took the loss, yielding 3 runs in the 10th inning. Chavez was added to Oakland's starting rotation to open the 2014 season, due to the spring injuries of Jarrod Parker and A.J. Griffin. He set career highs in starts and innings pitched, and finished with an 8‚Äì8 record with a 3.45 ERA. On January 12, 2015, Chavez and the Athletics agreed to a one-year deal worth $2.15 million, avoiding arbitration. Chavez was placed in the bullpen to start the season. On April 23, he was moved to the rotation and ended up making 26 starts for Oakland, a career high, pitching to a 7‚Äì15 record and a 4.18 ERA. His season ended in mid-September when he was diagnosed with a non- displaced fracture in his ribs. Second stint with Toronto On November 20, 2015, the Athletics traded Chavez to the Blue Jays for Liam Hendriks. He and the Blue Jays did not come to an agreement before the salary arbitration deadline on January 15, 2016. Chavez was seeking $4 million, while the Blue Jays countered at $3.6 million. On February 6, it was announced that Chavez had won his arbitration case. Chavez entered spring training in competition for the fifth starter role with Aaron Sanchez, Drew Hutchison, and Gavin Floyd. On March 28, it was announced that Sanchez would be the team's fifth starter, and Chavez would begin the season in the bullpen. Chavez pitched to a 1‚Äì2 record, 4.57 ERA, and 42 strikeouts in 41 innings before being traded. Los Angeles Dodgers On August 1, 2016, the Blue Jays traded Chavez to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Mike Bolsinger. He appeared in 23 games for the Dodgers with a 4.21 ERA. Los Angeles Angels On November 11, 2016, Chavez signed a one-year, $5.75 million contract with the Los Angeles Angels. Chavez was chosen to start in the Angels rotation at the beginning of the season due to the bevy of injuries. Chavez made 21 starts, going 5-9 with a 5.24 ERA before being put in the bullpen after the All Star Break. Chavez finished the season 7-11 in 38 games, 21 starts. Texas Rangers On February 23, 2018, Chavez signed a one-year contract with the Texas Rangers. Chicago Cubs On July 19, 2018, Chavez was acquired by the Chicago Cubs for minor league pitcher Tyler Thomas. Chavez posted an impressive 1.15 ERA in 32 appearances with the Cubs. Second stint with Texas In November 2018, Chavez signed a 2-year contract to return to the Texas Rangers. Chavez was placed on the injured list on August 13 with elbow inflammation, which stemmed from a bone spur. He finished the 2019 season going 3‚Äì5 with a 4.85 ERA in 78 innings. Chavez underwent surgery to remove loose bodies from his elbow on September 9.

The residence and estate is on the coast, within Malibu Lagoon State Beach park. It has been called the \\"Taj Mahal of Tile\\" due to its extensive use of decorative ceramic tiles created by Rufus Keeler of Malibu Potteries. The house was built in 1929 for Rhoda Rindge Adamson and Merritt Huntley Adamson, based on a Mediterranean Revival design by Stiles O. Clements of the architectural firm of Morgan, Walls & Clements. The Adamson House was designated as California Historical Landmark No. 966 around 1977, and added to the National Register of Historic Places around 1985. History Rindge- Adamson family Frederick Hastings Rindge was a wealthy Boston businessman who relocated to Los Angeles, and owned the \\"Rindge Ranch,\\" which included the historic Spanish land concession Rancho Topanga Malibu Sequit, enlarged by subsequent land purchases surrounding the ranch. The Rindge Ranch thus encompassed present day Malibu, California, and small portions of the Santa Monica Mountains. His daughter was Rhoda Agatha Rindge Adamson. Merritt Adamson (1888‚Äì1949) was a graduate of the University of Southern California Law School and was the captain of the 1912 football team, the first USC team to be known as the \\"Trojans.\\" Adamson met Rhoda Rindge while he was employed as the foreman of the Rindge Ranch. Rhoda Rindge reportedly became interested in him when she helped to nurse him back to good health after he was injured in an accident. The couple was married in 1915. In 1916 Adamson established a dairy business in the San Fernando Valley, in Tarzana known as Adohr Farms, the name representing his wife's name spelled backwards. The business became one of the country's largest dairies, operating one of the largest herds of Guernsey cows in the world. Construction and architecture House and courtyard Neptune Fountain The two-story, ten-room Adamson House was designed by Stiles O. Clements and built of steel-reinforced concrete. Completed in 1930, Stiles called the house an outstanding example of modified Mediterranean Revival-style architecture. Architectural historians refer to the style as a synthesis of Spanish Colonial Revival and Moorish Revival architecture. The house features teak woodworking, fireplaces in several interior and outdoor patio rooms, handpainted ceilings, lead-framed bottle glass windows, and \\"wrought-iron filigrees fitting over the windows like intricate jewelry.\\" The main floor is dominated by a large living room with windows on three sides. The room is still furnished as it was when the Adamsons lived there, including the large radio on which the family received news of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Other rooms on the main floor include a guest bedroom with a bathroom that is tiled literally from floor to ceiling, a dining room with an old convent table overlooking the ocean, a kitchen with an early version of a dishwasher and a colorful tiled clock, and the main entrance with its imposing wood door and tiled entrance table. There are four bedrooms and a small kitchenette upstairs. The master bedroom, where Mr. and Mrs. Adamson slept, is on the southwest corner of the house. It has a large tiled bathroom, and Mrs. Adamson's clothes and hat collection remain in her closet. Next to the master bedroom is the one designed for the Adamsons' son; its bathroom has detailed tiles depicting ships and nautical scenes. The girls' bedroom in the center facing the ocean has a tremendous view of the ocean and coast. These three bedrooms open onto a large upstairs patio with the home's most spectacular panoramic view of the ocean, the Malibu lagoon and the coast in both directions. The fourth bedroom upstairs is at the eastern end of the second floor and looks out of a large Dombeya tree that blooms with spectacular bright red flowers in the spring. Another striking feature of the house is the tiled swimming pool set into the sand that was equipped with a special filtering and heating apparatus that permitted the pool to be filled with either salt or freshwater. The Los Angeles Times in 1930 noted that the unusual features made the \\"plunge one of the finest in the southland.\\" A tile showcase Adamson House is best known for its extensive use of locally produced Malibu tile. In 1926, May K. Rindge (Rhonda Rindge Adamson's mother) established a tileworks east of the Malibu Pier. The factory was run by Rufus Keeler, an innovative ceramic engineer, who worked with local artisans to design decorative art tile, employing more than 100 persons in the late 1920s and creating \\"some of the most colorful and inventive glazed tiles in the country.\\" Hand-crafted art tile fired from local clay was specially designed for each room of the Adamson House. Even the ceiling of one of the bathrooms was tiled. In 1930, the Los Angeles Times reported: \\"Striking tile effects have been obtained from original designs of the craftsmen and artists of the pottery and floors, walls and patios.\\" Sixty-seven years later, the Los Angeles Times was still writing about the home's extraordinary tilework: \\"This huge Spanish-style mansion, built in 1929 (sic), might as well be called the house that tile built. Tile is everywhere ‚Äî from the ceramic wall clock above the tile-topped oak table in the kitchen to the floor-to-ceiling tiled bathrooms.\\" Dog bath at Adamson House One of the home's most popular examples of tilework is a imitation Persian carpet made of tile, including small pieces designed to look like rug fringes. In the exterior of the house, the colorfully tiled Neptune Fountain, Peacock Fountain and Star Fountain are among the home's most photographed examples of tilework. Nearby, there is also an elaborately tiled outdoor tub used by the Adamsons to bathe their dogs. The bathhouse and swimming pool are also covered with Malibu tile, and the dressing rooms have tiled showers with decorative motifs. The house has been called a \\"museum of tile\\" and the \\"Taj Mahal of Tile.\\" The Malibu Potteries only operated for six years from 1926‚Äì1932, and the Adamson House has many of the potteries' most significant remaining works. Early use The house was originally a vacation beach cottage, but the Adamsons eventually made it their permanent home. In December 1932, a fire started in the electrical wiring of the garage. One of the bedrooms was badly damaged, and the entire house was threatened by intense flames. The fire was put out by pumping crews from the forestry stations at Fernwood and Las Flores, aided by the Malibu Beach colony fire department. During World War II, the bathhouse was used by the United States Coast Guard as a local headquarters to watch out over the Malibu coast. Eminent domain and plans for beach parking Peacock fountain at Adamson House After the death of her husband, Rhoda Rindge Adamson continued to live in the house until her own death in April 1962. After her death, her heirs announced plans to build a $10‚Äì12 million \\"deluxe Waikiki-type beach resort\\" on the site, while preserving the house as an art and history museum. The State of California, however, filed an eminent domain lawsuit in 1966, seeking to raze the house and turn it into beach parking. (\\"For a while the Adamson House was in danger of being bulldozed to make way for additional beach parking.\\") (\\"Earlier, a task force of state Parks Department staff personnel recommended that the buildings be razed and the property used for parking, the purpose for which the state originally acquired the land.\\") (quoting the chief of the state recreation department's planning and development division as saying \\"we have to consider the need of the public for beach use -- parking, rest rooms, picnic units -- that sort of thing.\\") (\\"The state acquired the house and grounds in 1968 and announce plans to tear it down to provide beach parking ...\\") The state won its eminent domain lawsuit and purchased the property from the Adamson estate at the $2.69 million valuation set by the court. Preservation as a museum Entrance to Adamson House off PCH Despite the state's victory in the eminent domain proceeding, the Malibu Historical Society, supported by the Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation and the Adamson family, together with other leading Malibu citizens, fought over the next ten years to have the Adamson House preserved. While the state's plans to raze the house were put on hold, the house was leased to Pepperdine University from 1971-1982 as the residence of the university's chancellor, Norvel Young. In addition to its extensive use of Malibu tile, preservationists touted the house as \\"a prime example of California Moorish-Spanish architecture.\\" In 1976, preservationists won a victory when Herbert Rhodes, the director of the state's Department of Parks and Recreation, overruled staff recommendations to use the land for beach parking and recommended preservation of the entire property. Sylvia Rindge Adamson Neville, a granddaughter of Frederick Rindge, donated money to help restore the house, and additional funds were raised by the Malibu Historical Society. Beginning in October 1982, volunteers from the Malibu Lagoon State Beach Interpretive Association began work converting the garage into a small historic museum. In 1983, the house and Malibu Lagoon Museum (located in the garage) were opened to the public for docent-led tours. The house is open to the public for tours on Wednesdays through Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Neptune Fountain detail While the house is looked after by a dedicated staff of state employees and volunteers, a lack of funding from the state has led to maintenance problems as of September 2008. The area beneath the upstairs balcony overlooking the ocean shows signs of deterioration. A large iron barbecue grill that was a gift from Will Rogers to the Adamson family had been left exposed to the elements and is in need of repair. Several tile-topped tables that formerly sat in the backyard have been vandalized and now sit in an enclosed area.

In 2007, the film adaptation of the same name was released in theaters, directed by Ben Affleck. Plot Boston-based lovers and private investigators Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro are hired by a woman to look into the case of her niece, Amanda McCready, whose disappearance has become an important local news story. They take the case despite the seeming reluctance of the girl's uncle, Lionel. During the investigation they quickly come to the conclusion that Amanda's mother, Helene, who has been prominently featured in the news stories about the case, is a degenerate and neglectful parent. At the time of Amanda's disappearance, Helene had left her alone for several hours while she partied at a local dive bar. In another incident, revealed later, Helene had once left her daughter unsupervised on the beach for several hours, resulting in the girl getting a terrible sunburn. While Helene has been pleading with the public for her daughter's return, in private she often seems more concerned about her own life and the possible benefit the publicity might have on it. In perhaps the most irresponsible act of parenting, Patrick and Angie discover that Helene had taken Amanda along while she and her then boyfriend Skinny Ray stole two hundred thousand dollars from men working for the imprisoned drug dealer Cheese. Patrick and Angie begin working on the case with police officers Remy Broussard and Nick \\"Poole\\" Raftopoulous, members of the Boston Police Department's CAC (Crimes Against Children) Division. In investigating the missing money from Helene and Ray's drug deal, Patrick, Angie, Broussard, and Poole find the money along with two dead bodies, acquaintances of Helene's from when the money was originally stolen. The police receive an apparent ransom demand calling for a meetup at the Quincy Quarries to exchange the money for the girl. Under cover of darkness and with the area surrounded by police, Angie, Patrick, Poole, and Remy arrive at the quarry. Before they can meet the kidnappers, a confused gun battle breaks out, resulting in the death of a couple of gangsters working for Cheese and the disappearance of the ransom money. Angie finds Amanda's favorite doll, which had been taken along with her, in the water of the quarry, and they conclude that the little girl was likely thrown in and died. Months later, Patrick crosses paths with Helene and sees her to be emotionally wrought and reeling from Amanda's death. Patrick later learns that Remy had known Lionel, Helene's brother, before Amanda's disappearance. Questioning Lionel with the aid of Justice Department agent Ryerson, Patrick and Angie discover that the whole kidnapping had been orchestrated at Lionel's behest in order to get Amanda away from Helene's neglectful care. Remy and another policeman, Pasquale, disguised as burglars, stage a holdup of the bar where Patrick, Angie, and Lionel are meeting. After it becomes clear to Patrick that the two are there to kill Lionel and end the investigation into Amanda, a gunfight ensues which ends with Pasquale dead, Lionel and Ryerson grievously wounded, and Remy fleeing on foot. Patrick gives chase to Remy, finding that Angie had shot him in the barroom melee. After refusing medical help and thereby ensuring his imminent death (and avoiding imprisonment for his role in most of the crimes committed or unearthed during the novel), Remy confesses to Patrick that he is part of a small ring of cops who take children from abusive and neglectful homes and place them with caring competent parents. The first child had been his own son, who he had found as an infant malnourished and abused in a crack house, the child's birth mother so uninterested in his welfare that she had never filed a missing persons report after Remy took him. Remy had conspired with Lionel to take Amanda from Helene's care to ensure her proper upbringing. To protect Amanda, he refuses to tell Patrick of her whereabouts before his own death. Patrick later figures that Remy and Poole's captain, Doyle, had taken custody of Amanda. Patrick, Angie, and two allied Boston cops (Oscar and Devin, from previous books) go to the captain's forest home where they discover Amanda McCready, apparently happy and well cared for by Doyle and his wife. Angie begs Patrick, Oscar, and Devin not to reveal Amanda's whereabouts, insisting that she's with a loving family now. Angie and Patrick argue about the proper course with Patrick finally supporting the decision to call the authorities to the house and reveal Lionel, Remy, and Doyle's scheme. Amanda is returned home. Remy's wife and illegally adopted child are never seen again, gone, Patrick assumes, with the two hundred thousand dollars from the botched ransom exchange. Angie, disappointed, leaves Patrick. Patrick later stops by the McCready household to find Amanda listlessly watching TV as Helene gets ready to go out on a date and leave Amanda with a neighbor, a sign that, after everything, nothing has changed. 1998 American novels Novels by Dennis Lehane Novels set in Boston American novels adapted into films Barry Award-winning works Dilys Award-winning works William Morrow and Company books ","title":"Gone, Baby, Gone (novel)"},{"id":"19147316","text":" ","title":"Gora (racial epithet)"},{"id":"19147329","text":"is a retired Japanese wrestler.

West Dean House is a large flint-faced manor house situated in West Dean, West Sussex, near the historic City of Chichester. This country estate has approximately of land and dates back to 1086, with various royal connections throughout the years. In 1971 the Estate became the home of West Dean College, a centre of study of conservation, arts, crafts, writing, gardening, and music. West Dean is Grade II* listed on the National Heritage List for England, and its landscaped park and gardens are equally listed Grade II* on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. The Medieval estate The earliest known reference to the West Dean Estate is found in the Domesday Book in 1086, where it was included in the manor of Singleton as, a forest and hunting park. The Earls of Arundel and the Dukes of Norfolk held these lands for almost 500 years until 1572, when the 4th Duke of Norfolk was accused of treason. He was stripped of his possessions by Elizabeth I and then beheaded . She later restored the properties and title to the Duke's eldest son Phillip. It was Phillip who built the first manor house at West Dean, West Sussex in 1603, then known as Earl‚Äôs Court, later to be renamed Canon House due to its connections to Chichester Cathedral. The Jacobean manor In 1621 Phillip sold the manor and it passed into various ownerships, including the Sussex families of John Aylwin of Lewes and Richard Lewkenor of Stoughton. It was John Lewkenor in 1622 who built the Jacobean Manor house, on the site that was previously occupied by the medieval building. The building was built in an E-shape, common in the late 16th century. The Peachey family The St Roches' Arboretum at West Dean In 1738 the West Dean Estate passed into the hands of the Peachey family from Petworth, just over the South Downs. Sir James Peachey, the 1st Lord Selsey, commissioned the leading architect of time, James Wyatt to rebuild the manor house, creating the core flint mansion seen at West Dean today. Wyatt is also responsible for the orangery on the West Dean estate. James went on to gain a vast acreage of land, leaving it to his son, Sir John the second Lord Selsey on his death. John was responsible for laying out the parkland and arboretum in West Dean. All of John‚Äôs children were without heirs, and in 1871 the last Peachey died. Recently there has been a link made with the Peachey family of Portsmouth. The James family A book sale in progress at Messrs Sotheby, Wilkinson & Hodge of Wellington Street, 1888. In 1891 West Dean became the home of newly married William (Willie) Dodge James and Evelyn Forbes the daughter of Sir Charles Forbes, a Scottish aristocrat. William James had inherited great wealth from his father, American born Liverpool based merchant Daniel James. He bought West Dean from Frederick Bowers, a merchant who had owned the property since the death of its previous owner, Caroline Mary (Peachey) Vernon Harcourt (1785-1871). She had inherited the estate when her brother, Henry John Peachey, 3rd Baron Selsey died in 1838. Caroline was the wife of Rev. Leveson Venables Vernon Harcourt, son of Edward Venables-Vernon- Harcourt, Archbishop of York. In her will she had bequeathed West Dean to a distant relative, Ulick de Burgh, 1st Marquess of Clanricarde, who immediately sold it to Frederick Bowers. Clanricarde also disposed of several other properties left to him by Caroline plus the extensive library housed at West Dean, the sale of which took nine days at Sotheby's and included a copy of John Gower's rare Confessio Amantis that sold for ¬£670. William Dodge James; St Andrew's Church, West Dean, West Sussex UK When James moved to the West Dean Estate in 1891, he set about altering and greatly extending the house and commissioned Ernest George and Harold Peto to do so. Ernest George helped embellish the state rooms and Harold Peto designed a -long pergola, still a highlight of the gardens today. West Dean House became one of the largest flint structures in the country. The interior of the house reflects William and his brothers Frank and Arthur‚Äôs, passion for big game hunting, with souvenirs of their visits to Africa, Arabia, and Afghanistan displayed throughout the house. House parties at West Dean were attended by The Prince of Wales - who became King Edward VII when his mother Queen Victoria died. He was William James's son Edward James‚Äôs Godfather and a regular participant of pheasant and partridge shoots on the West Dean estate. The Prince of Wales had a group of rich and entertaining friends that became known as the Marlborough House set and included people like Evelyn and her sister-in-law Mary Venetia James (n√©e Cavendish-Bentinck). William and Evelyn had five children, four girls, Millicent, Alexandra, Silvia, and Audrey. In 1907, after 18 years of marriage, their son and heir Edward James was born. William became High Sheriff of Sussex in 1897 and Deputy Lieutenant of Sussex in 1892. He was also appointed Commander of the Royal Victorian Order by Edward VII in 1908. Edward James Edward James was born on 16 August 1907, the only son of William Dodge James who had inherited a fortune from his father on his 25th birthday in 1879 (Daniel James's will, CODICIL 13th day of April 1876) and who became an adventurer, accompanying his brother Frank Linsly James on many of his expeditions, often drawing maps of uncharted lands. His mother was Evelyn Forbes, a Scots socialite, who was reputedly fathered by the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII). Edward James had four older sisters: Audrey, Millicent, Xandra, and Silvia. He was educated briefly at Eton, and then at Le Rosey in Switzerland, followed by Christ Church, Oxford, where he was a contemporary of Evelyn Waugh and Harold Acton. In 1912 he inherited the West Dean House in Sussex, on the death of his father. He was only aged four at the death of his father in March of that year; however Edward did not take control of the estate until he was 25. St Andrew's West Dean, West Sussex UK In 1939 Edward James wrote to Aldous Huxley expressing his fear that after the war, certain arts, and particularly the techniques of the craftsmen would be lost. As a solution James suggested that his estate be set up as an educational community where the techniques of craftsmanship could be preserved and taught, whilst restoring old work and creating new art works. In 1956 Wispers School, an independent boarding school for girls aged between 11 and 18, moved to West Dean House. In 1964 James gave the House to a charitable trust, The Edward James Foundation, but the school was able to remain at West Dean until 1968. West Dean College Pre-fabricated temporary roofing structure ready to be lifted onto West Dean House roof 2018/19 The Edward James Foundation was established in 1964 as a charitable, educational trust which supports and teaches artists and craftsmen and in 1971 the Foundation established West Dean College which offers full-time and short courses. Since the House became a college, extensive alterations and additions have been made to the bedrooms and former service areas of the house, in order to make it suitable for students. Roofing over the former stable yard and the surrounding buildings has enabled arts and crafts workshops to be built. All the work took place over a period of 20 years, directed by architect John Warren, who tried to retain the historical features of the house. Major repair and improvement work was due to be carried out on the roof in 2019. A planning application was made to the South Downs National Park in 2017. The West Dean estate The West Dean Estate has approximately of land. The estate has 136 houses and cottages, as well as more than 100 farm buildings; some are occupied by the staff of the estate and college, as well as by pensioners of the foundation and local families. There are twelve farms on the estate, many of which have been owned by the estate for generations; their agricultural activates are split between livestock and cereals. Woodlands make up around of the estate, the main tree species being the native beech, found on the South Downs. The woodlands were badly affected by the storms of 1987 and 1990, and the woodland took over a decade to recover. The woodlands have become increasingly important, particularly when they began to supply the key fuel to provide heating for the estate in the 1970s. After the old boilers and electric heaters proved to be incapable with dealing with the needs of the ever growing West Dean College, other methods were looked into, and wood fuel appeared to be the most eco- friendly alternative. One thousand two hundred tonnes of wood chippings are needed to supply not only West Dean College, but several other buildings on the estate as well, including the village church. The woodland also conceals a rich heritage with sites like Goosehill Camp dating back to the Iron Age.

It operates the KC-10 Extender aircraft conducting aerial refueling missions as a reserve associate of the 305th Air Mobility Wing. The unit was first activated as a Douglas C-47 Skytrain transport unit that saw combat with the 435th Troop Carrier Group in Western Europe. The squadron flew paratroopers on airborne assaults on Normandy (Operation Overlord); Southern France (Operation Dragoon); the Netherlands (Operation Market Garden), and Germany (Operation Varsity). It also flew combat resupply missions in the relief of Bastogne in 1945. The 78th was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation for its actions during the Normandy invasion. The squadron was activated in the reserve in 1947. It was called to active duty in March 1951 for the Korean War, serving at its home station, Miami International Airport. It returned to reserve duty in December 1952, but it was activated in 1954. The squadron was activated again in 1955 as part of a program to improve recruiting by spreading reserve units to smaller population centers. History World War II 435th Troop Carrier Group C-47 landing The squadron was first activated at Bowman Field, Kentucky in February 1943, as one of the original squadrons of the 435th Troop Carrier Group. The group used Douglas C-47 Skytrains and Douglas C-53 Skytrooopers in preparing for duty overseas with Ninth Air Force.Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 306‚Äì307 The 78th left the United States in October 1943, arriving at RAF Langar, England, in early November. On arrival, it began training for participation in the airborne operation over Normandy. The squadron flew its first combat missions on D-Day by dropping paratroopers of 101st Airborne Division near Cherbourg. The unit towed Waco CG-4A and Airspeed Horsa gliders carrying reinforcements to the same location that afternoon and on the following morning. The squadron received a Distinguished Unit Citation for its part in Operation Overlord, the Normandy invasion. The squadron began transport services following the landings in France and intermittently engaged in missions of this type until V-E Day In these operations the 78th hauled supplies such as serum, blood plasma, radar sets, clothing, rations, and ammunition. It also evacuated wounded personnel to Allied hospitals. The squadron interrupted these supply and evacuation missions to train for and participate in three major airborne assaults. It was part of a detachment of three squadrons from the 435th Group that moved to Tarquinia Airfield, Italy in July 1944 for Operation Dragoon, the invasion of Southern France.Citus et Certus. p. 25 The detachment dropped paratroopers over the assault area on 15 August and also released gliders carrying troops and equipment such as jeeps, guns, and ammunition. The following day it flew a resupply mission over France, then transported supplies to bases in Italy before returning to England at the end of the month. In September 1944 the squadron participated in Operation Market Garden the unsuccessful airborne operation intended to seize bridges across the Meuse River in the Netherlands, dropping paratroops of the 82d and 101st Airborne Divisions and releasing gliders carrying reinforcements. During the Battle of the Bulge, the unit delivered supplies to isolated combat positions of the 101st Airborne and 7th Armored Divisions in Bastogne and Marcouray, Belgium.Citus et Certus, p. 26 The unit moved to Bretigny Airfield, France in February 1945 to prepare for Operation Varsity, the airborne assault across the Rhine River. Each squadron aircraft participating in this operation towed two gliders transporting troops and equipment to the east bank of the Rhine near Wesel on 24 March. The unit then flew resupply missions to Germany in support of ground forces. The squadron transported supplies to occupation forces in Germany and evacuated Allied prisoners of war after V-E Day. The squadron and the 435th Group returned to the United States in August and the group was inactivated on 15 November 1945. Reserve troop carrier operations Curtiss C-46D The squadron was once again activated as a reserve unit under Air Defense Command at Imeson Field, Florida on 17 July 1947. It was again assigned to the 435th Troop Carrier Group, located at Morrison Field, Florida. The squadron was nominally a Curtiss C-46 Commando unit, but it is not clear to what extent it was equipped with tactical aircraft while at Imeson. In June 1949, Continental Air Command, which had assumed the responsibility for training reserve units from Air Defense Command in 1948, reorganized its reserve units under the wing base organization system. As part of this reorganization and unit reductions required by President Truman's reduced 1949 defense budget,Knaack, p. 25 the 435th Group and its squadrons moved to Miami International Airport, where it was assigned to the newly formed 435th Troop Carrier Wing and formed its cadre from elements of the inactivating 100th Bombardment Group. Air Force flying operations at Imeson came to a temporary end. The squadron was manned at only 25% of the strength of a regular unit.Cantwell, p. 74Ravenstein, pp. 230‚Äì231 Fairchild C-119G Flying Boxcar At Miami, the squadron trained with C-46s under the supervision of the active duty 2585th Air Force Reserve Training Center. The squadron was ordered into active service in March 1951 as a result of the Korean War. Along with other reserve troop carrier units called to active duty, it formed Tactical Air Command's Eighteenth Air Force. The squadron's initial function was to train C-46 aircrews for service in Korea.Citus et Certus, p. 8 The 78th also trained with Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcars. Although it remained at Miami, the unit deployed twice while on active duty: to Laurinburg-Maxton Airport, North Carolina from 21 July until 1 September 1951 and to Grenier Air Force Base, New Hampshire from 2 January to 3 March 1952.Citus et Certus, p. 28 It was relieved from active duty and inactivated on 1 December 1952 and its mission, personnel and equipment were transferred to the regular 746th Troop Carrier Squadron, which was activated the same day.Ravenstein, pp. 251‚Äì252 The squadron was activated as a reserve unit the same day at the same station, but with the personnel and equipment of the inactivating 814th Troop Carrier Squadron.Ravenstein, pp. 267‚Äì268 In the reserve, the squadron once again flew the Curtiss Commandos. Reserve airlift and air refueling operations August 1962 ‚Äì March 1972, during which times it often augmented Military Airlift Command's strategic airlift operations worldwide and took part in domestic training exercises. The squadron also served in an active status from, March 1951 ‚Äì December 1952 and October 1961 ‚Äì August 1962. Between April 1972 and October 1973, it performed a special operations role. In November 1981, the 78th began strategic aerial refueling and airlift operations. In December 1989 it refueled aircraft on way to Panama during Operation Just Cause. During Operation Desert Shield in 1990, its crews refueled more than a hundred aircraft on their way from the United States to the Persian Gulf area and delivered passengers and cargo.

Biography Kolar was born in Zemun in 1956 where he lived until 1963 when he moved to inner town in Belgrade. He moved to a building where two of his future bandmates lived, Vlada Divljan and Bo≈æa Jovanoviƒá. In an interview Kolar noted that Divljan was the first boy he had met in his new neighborhood on the day his family was moving in. First musical steps In 1968 Divljan decided to take up playing and so did Kolar. Divljan managed to get a mandolin and later bought a guitar while Kolar got his first guitar by getting a vacuum cleaner on a newspaper lottery. His parents sold the vacuum cleaner and bought him a guitar. The two started learning how to play while watching others play in their neighborhood at the places where the young were gathering. Later they went to a guitar course at RU \\"Braƒáa Stamenkoviƒá\\" held by professor Branko Peri≈°iƒá. In the meantime Kolar, Divljan and Bo≈æa Jovanoviƒá formed a band called Faraoni (Pharaohs) as Divljan at the time had a necklace from Egypt. The band was soon renamed to Hoplipe when the three found out there was a popular band from Kopar called Faraoni. In May 1969 the three had a very successful appearance at their school which Zdenko credits as the beginning of his musical career. Zvuk Ulice The first serious band Kolar and Divljan formed in 1976 called MARILYN (after youthful infatuation with Marilyn Monroe ‚Äì but the first concert that was to be played in I Bgd Gimnasia featured newly ordered T-shirts from USA which came misspelled, so the name was promptly changed to MERLIN (the magician)) which was soon renamed to Zvuk Ulice. The lineup featured Vlada Divljan first only on guitar and vocals, Kolar on bass, Kokan Popoviƒá on drums, Dragan Mitriƒá on keyboards, Bora Antiƒá on saxophone and Dragana Milkoviƒá on piano and vocals. The band played a combination of melodic rock, hard rock and jazz rock. Beside their own tracks they also performed songs by The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, etc. The band had recording sessions at Radio Belgrade and the recordings were broadcast on radio stations, but were never released. They performed at the last BOOM Festival in Novi Sad and Zajeƒçar Gitarijada festival in 1979. Since the drummer, Kokan Popoviƒá, had to go to serve the Yugoslav People's Army the band split up. Deƒçaci plus Bradonje, Idoli In late 1979 Divljan created a conceptual band called Deƒçaci (The Boys) with Neboj≈°a Krstiƒá and Srƒëan ≈†aper. The three, with Dragan Papiƒá who was a kind of media activist. He published photographs of Deƒçaci in youth magazines \\"Vidici\\" and \\"Izgled\\". In the meantime the three tried to play together but without progress. Then Divljan invited Kolar and Bo≈æa Jovanoviƒá to join the band and, since the both Kolar and Jovanoviƒá wore beards, the band was renamed to Deƒçaci plus Bradonje (The Boys plus The Bearded). On 1 March 1980 the band was renamed to Idoli on the first official rehearsal held that day. A month later Papiƒá made a deal with \\"Vidici\\" to finance the recording of the first Idoli single which was released as a present with a copy of the magazine. The single \\"Pomoƒá, pomoƒá\\" / \\"Retko te viƒëam sa devojkama\\" became a local hit. The next single was released for Jugoton and performed the Festival Omladina with the song \\"Za≈°to su danas devojke ljute\\". In the meantime Idoli, with Elektriƒçni Orgazam and ≈†arlo Akrobata participated the Paket aran≈æman compilation. Kolar was credited as writer on the track \\"Amerika\\" which appeared to be the only Idoli song he appeared as writer. The release proved to be one of the most influential Yugoslav rock releases. The band also prepared their debut record which came out to be a six-song EP entitled VIS Idoli it was a huge success and was sold in about 200.000. After the release of the EP, Jovanoviƒá left the band and was replaced by Kolar's and Divljan's former bandmate Kokan Popoviƒá. In late 1981 the band entered the studio to record their first long play album. Odbrana i poslednji dani was released in early 1982 and proved to be a high appreciated album by the critics and a part of the fans, but due to non-commercial approach and sound, considered a failure by Jugoton. The album was voted the best in 1982 and had the best album design. In 1985 D≈æuboks magazine voted the album to be the best Yugoslav rock album of the 20th century. The band had a tour following the record release after which Kolar left the band to serve the Yugoslav People's Army and was replaced by Branko Isakoviƒá. By the time Kolar came back from the army, the band had already split up. Together with Branko Isakoviƒá, Kolar recorded bass parts on the last Idoli release which is the \\"≈†est dana juna\\" soundtrack album. After Idoli split up, Kolar took a break with playing and got employed as trolley bus driver. He also worked as an actor in TV commercials. Zona B, work with Vlada Divljan In 1987 Kolar joined a blues band Zona B. In 1989 after several lineup changes the band featured Jovan Saviƒá Lole (vocals), Du≈°an Bezuha Duda (guitar), Tomislav Rakija≈° Toma (guitar), Vladimir Filipoviƒá Buca (keyboards), Du≈°an Ristic-Rista (drums), and Zdenko Kolar-Zdene (bass guitar). The band performed blues classics on numerous appearances in Serbia and became one of the greatest Serbian club attractions. Kolar also played in Vlada Divljan's band on Tajni ≈æivot A. P. ≈†andorova tour. In 1991 Zona B released their debut album entitled Bestseller featuring cover versions of blues classics. The album was released by PGP RTB and was produced by Du≈°an Bezuha. The next release was also a cover album, Juke-Box (released in 1993), this time featuring two Zona B songs written by Bezuha and Saviƒá, My Woman and Don't Put Me Down. This release was the last featuring Saviƒá, Rakija≈° and Filipoviƒá. In 1995 Kolar became the bassist of the Vlada Divljan backing band called the Old Stars Band also featuring Aleksandar ≈†andorov (keyboards), Srƒëan Gojkoviƒá Gile (guitar, vocals), Marko Milivojeviƒá (drums) and Boris Bunjac (percussion). The band had two concerts at Novi Sad sad Studio \\"M\\", an NS Plus Unplugged and a regular show with electric equipment on 18 and 23 January 1996. The material recorded from the shows was released on a live album entitled Odbrana i za≈°tita released through B92 Records. Divljan returned to Australia and Kolar continued working with Zona B. Kolar also appeared in the \\"Lepa sela lepo gore\\" movie as Mirovnjak and \\"Sudbina jednog razuma\\" TV drama in 1996. He also appeared on the Elektriƒçni Orgazam unplugged album as the band announcer. The second time Divljan returned to Yugoslavia Kolar and the rest of the Old Stars Band recorded a soundtrack album for \\"Tri palme za dve bitange i ribicu\\" (\\"Three Palms Trees on the Isle Of Happiness\\"). They also had a successful tour in Slovenia in July 1998. When the tour ended Divljan and the Old Stars Band entered the studio in Novi Sad and recorded the Sve la≈æi sveta album which was released in 2000 due to political situation in the country. In the meantime Vlada Divljan moved to Vienna. Petar Pera Zarija (vocals), Pop Ma≈°ina and Rok Ma≈°ina former member Zoran Bo≈æinoviƒá (guitar, vocals) ‚Äì brother of guitarist Vidoja Bo≈æinoviƒá (Dim Bez Vatre, Pop Ma≈°ina, Dah, Opus, Rok Ma≈°ina and Riblja ƒåorba), and Ljuba ƒêordeviƒá (harmonica) became new Zona B members. The new lineup performed the song \\"Negde daleko\\", which is a cover of a Pop Ma≈°ina hit, which appeared on the Blues Summit Coupe Vol. 1 compilation. By the time Pirat was released, ƒêordeviƒá left the band so the band featured guitarist and producer Dragan Dadi Stojanoviƒá in 1999. In 2002 Vlada Divljan started working on the Die Tonzentrale project featuring Kolar on bass. The album came out in 2003 as Vlada Divljan presents Die Tonzentrale. The style of the album was a combination of jazz, blues, pop, rock and electronic music. Zona B released a new record Original featuring only Zona B tracks in 2005. The album, like the previous was released by Duda Bezuha. Kolar also appeared as guest on Elektriƒçni Orgazam album Harmonajzer in 2002 as backing vocalist. In 2007 Zona B released the Devil Blues album and celebrated their 20th anniversary. The album design was done by Kolar. He also performed with the Old Stars Band, later reformed as Vlada Divljan & Nevladina Organizacija.
