Her racing career consisted of eight races between April and October 1932. Having finished second on her debut and seventh in the 1000 Guineas she was still a maiden when she recorded her biggest win in the Epsom Oaks in June. She went on to win the Coronation Stakes, Richemont Stakes and Newmarket Oaks as well as finishing fourth in a strong edition of the St Leger. As a broodmare she produced several good winners and was the female-line ancestor of Wild Again. Background Udaipur was a good looking brown mare with no white markings bred in England by her owner Aga Khan III. She entered training with Frank Butters at the Fitzroy House stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. She was sired by Blandford an Irish-bred stallion who won three of his four races including the Princess of Wales's Stakes. He went to become an outstanding breeding stallion who was a three-time Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland and whose other offspring included Bahram, Blenheim, Brantome and Windsor Lad. Udaipur's dam Uganda was a top-class racehorse who won the Prix de Diane and Prix Royal-Oak in 1924. After being bought by the Aga Khan at the end of her racing career she became a very successful broodmare whose other foals included Ukrania (Prix de Diane), Umidwar (Champion Stakes), Ut Majeur (Cesarewitch) and Una (dam of Palestine). Racing career=1932: three-year-old season= Having been unraced as a juvenile, Udaipur made her racecourse debut in April, when she finished second in a maiden race at Newmarket Racecourse. She was stepped up in class for the 1000 Guineas at the same track at the end of the month and came home seventh of the nineteen runners behind Kandy, a French-trained outsider who had been left in the race by mistake. On 3 of June, ridden by the Irish jockey Michael Beary, Udaipur stated at odds of 10/1 for the 154th running of the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse. Lord Woolavington's Will o' the Wisp and Lord Glanely's Ada Dear started joint favourites, while the other nine runners included the 1000 Guineas runner-up Thorndean and the Cheveley Park Stakes winner Concordia. After racing just behind the leaders, Udaipur made a forward move early in the straight and overtook the leader Will o' the Wisp a furlong out. She won the race by two lengths from Will o' the Wisp with the same distance back to Giudecca in third place. Later in June Udaipur was dropped back in distance for the Coronation Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot. She was not expected to be suited by the shorter trip and started at odds of 6/1, but with Beary in the saddle she won \\"in a canter\\" by three lengths from Pennycross (later to win the Falmouth Stakes) and Ada Dear. Her performance led to her being described as \\"the best three-year-old filly in the country\\". After a two month break Udaipur returned to win the Richemont Stakes at Hurst Park and was then matched against male opposition in the St Leger at Doncaster Racecourse on 7 September. With Beary opting to ride the Epsom Derby runner-up Dastur, she was partnered by Harry Wraggg. The filly ran creditably to finish fourth of the nineteen runners behind her unfancied stablemate Firdaussi after being denied a clear run in the straight. The unplaced runners included April the Fifth and Orwell. Udaipur returned to winning form to take the Newmarket Oaks over fourteen furlongs, but on her final appearance she ran poorly to finish fourth in the Atalanta Stakes at Sandown Park. Assessment and honours Udaipur's earnings of ¬£15,047 in 1932 made her the second biggest money winner in England behind Firdaussi, with Miracle, Myrobella, Orwell and April the Fifth filling the next four places on the list. In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Udaipur an \\"inferior\\" winner of the Oaks. Breeding record At the end of her racing career Udaipur was retired to become a broodmare for the Aga Khan's stud. Her offspring included the top-classperformers Umiddad, Naishapur and Dust Devil as well as the influential broodmares Clovelly and Sonibai. In total, she produced at least nine foals between 1934 and 1949. *Dharampur, a bay colt, foaled in 1934, sired by Fairway. Won one race; third in Jersey Stakes. *Airway, bay colt, 1937, by Fairway.

In 2006 the school moved to its current campus in Bothell. Philosophy Clearwater is a democratic school where students create the rules and policies that affect the entire school. The educational philosophy is similar to unschooling in that student-chosen activities are the primary means of learning. Curriculum Clearwater students explore their own interests at their own pace. Students are not segregated by age and are free to determine how they spend their time. The school has no assignments, no grades, and no classes unless students organize them. Facilities The school's campus consists of five buildings on 3.4 acres and includes a kitchen, an art room, a music room, a theater, a computer room, an office, a library, an active room, and quiet areas. The school also has a play yard, and North Creek flows through the campus. The school has an ongoing partnership with Snohomish County for ecological restoration of North Creek for salmon and other wildlife. Clearwater School/Commons Restoration (North Creek) Project The campus generates solar energy using a photovoltaic system as part of the school's commitment to sustainable practices. Government The democratic structure of the school gives students a direct say in how the school is managed. Students and staff members each have a vote in School Meeting, where rules and policies are created, and in Judicial Committee, where rules are enforced. Staff The adults at Clearwater are called staff, to distinguish their role from the role of traditional teachers. Staff members do not tell students how they should spend their time; instead they play, encourage, and learn alongside students.

It borne the original name plate on the front with the inscription \\"M. W. Baldwin, Philadelphia, 1856\\". The early history of this engine is apparently lost. The owners of the saw mill purchased it as a second-hand locomotive around 1882, but all records of the sale have become lost so that any previous owners are unknown.Ancient Locomotive Still In Service In: The Locomotive, by Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company.

It has been operated by over 100 persons, including all of the women of their family. Several efforts to purchase it have therefore been unsuccessful.  Technical data  The cylinders on this engine were 12 inches in diameter by 22 inches stroke. The driving wheels were 54 inches in diameter. The original crank pins, rods, straps and keys were apparently still in use in 1925. The left front cylinder head has been replaced but the right cylinder was intact and the pistons were said to be the original ones placed in the engine when it was built. The boiler was 36 inches in diameter by 15 it. 6 inches long. It is jacketed with brass, as are also the steam chests. Patches and replacements have been made around the firebox, but the crown sheet was believed to be still the original one in 1925. There were not recors or indications of any repairs ever having been made to the barrel until 1925. In 1923 the locomotive was engaged temporarily in hauling logs on a short main line, and consequently had to pass an Interstate Commerce Commission inspection. Accordingly, it was given a hydrosatic test and approved for operation at 120 lbs pressure, and the safety valve was set to 120 lbs.

Research Hoyt Bleakley's research has focused on economic history, development economics, labour economics, health, and international macroeconomics. Based on his research, he is currently (January 2018) ranked among the top 3% of economists registered on IDEAS/RePEc. Major findings of his research include: * that the hookworm eradication campaigns in the American South after 1910 were effective in drastically reducing hookworm infection rates and thereby contributed strongly to the educational and economic development of these areas; * that malaria eradication campaigns in the United States (ca. 1920) and in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico (ca. 1955) strongly improved labour productivity by reducing childhood exposure to malaria and explain a substantial part of cross-regional differences in income; * that Latin American firms holding dollar-denominated debt don't invest less than their peso-indebted counterparts following a depreciation against the dollar and adjust the currency denomination of their liabilities to hedge how sensitive their profits become to exchange rate movements; * that English proficiency significantly increases wages among adults who came to the U.S. as children by affecting their education; * how the location of certain North American cities at portage sites had a long-term impact on their economic development, even long after portage had become obsolete.

Life and work  Passon was born in a working class family and was the only son, out of three, to obtain qualifications that allowed him to apply for university. He came out as gay, having attended the gay and lesbian youth group, Pink Power, in Frankfurt on Main. Passon went on to study political science at the Free University of Berlin. In 1989, he further studied postgraduate law at the Goethe University Frankfurt. Passon worked in a German bank. He travelled several times to former German colonies in the West Pacific, to complete essays for the respected historian Karl-Heinz Grundmann. Several of Passons papers regarding sexual science and cultures have been published in specialist magazines and in national press, and are considered to be influential.  Volunteer activism  Passon has volunteered extensively in numerous organisations, including Germany's Federal Agency for Technical Relief (which offers support for disasters both in Germany and abroad), the German Life Saving Association and the German Sports Confederation. His activism intensified during his studies, where he sat on the editorial board of the Schwule Presseschau (translating as Gay Press Review, later the Gay and Lesbian Press Review), archived in Berlin's Schwules Museum. He also sat on the board of the gay and lesbian sports club Vorspiel SSL (translating as foreplay), where they specialise in a vast number of sports including volleyball, swimming, tennis etc. Since 2000, Passon has been a member of the new Scientific-Humanitarian Committee (whk). He published several papers in sexual political magazines, including Gigi ‚Äì Zeitschrift f√ºr sexuelle Emanzipation and junge Welt. In addition, Passon has volunteered as an honorary judge in the Superior State Social Court of the states of Berlin and Brandenburg since 2005.  Awards  Passon has been honoured with twelve state awards for his achievements, including the strictly limited Honorary Pin for Special Social Commitment of the state of Berlin in 2016. As a left-wing critic of repressive sexual policy, he declined accepting the cross of merit of the high-ranking Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.  Sexual activism  Passon's highly acclaimed essay, \\"Barebacking @ Sex Academy\\", defines the difference between \\"unsafe sex\\" of men who have sex with men (MSM) and \\"barebacking\\" as risk-conscious and consensual, unprotected anal intercourse (UAI), regardless of the presence of sexually transmitted infections (STI). The paper was selected for publication in the latest booklet \\"Sexualit√§t und Strafe\\" (translating as \\"Sexuality and Punishment\\"), featuring in the Kriminologisches Journal (translating as Criminological Journal), by the distinguished sexual scientists, Daniela Klimke and R√ºdiger Lautmann. He has also written extensively not just about barebacking, gay rights, but also sex work in Germany.  Documentary  Passon is featured as the protagonist in the critically acclaimed documentary, After the Future (German: Nach der Zukunft). It was filmed between 2013 and 2016. Since the world premiere of the film on 31 October 2017 at the 60th DOK Leipzig Film Festival, Passon has been \\"outed\\" publicly as being gay with HIV. The film about him received an Honorary Mention in the German Competition for Long Documentary and Animated Film and was further nominated for several awards, including the esteemed Ver.di Prize for Solidarity, Humanity and Fairness and the prestigious DEFA Sponsoring Award. The film has been marked as controversial due to scenes of a sexual nature and explicit drug use.

Profile at mxat.ru, the Moscow Art Theatre site Biography Maria Bychkova was born in Moscow into a family of the staroobryadtsy merchants. She studied at the First Moscow Gymnasium, where Olga Gzovskaya was one of her classmates. In 1901 she enrolled in the just opened Moscow Art Theatre Drama School and a year later joined the MAT troupe, as Maria Germanova. She debuted in 1903 in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, then garnered positive reviews as Elena in Maxim Gorky's Children of the Sun (1905), Sofya in Griboyedov's Woe from Wit and Agnes in Henrik Ibsen's Brand (both 1906). It was mostly upon Germanova's stage persona that Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko has relied upon in his stage experiments, which included Boris Godunov by Alexander Pushkin (her as Marina Mnishek, 1907), Anathema by Leonid Andreyev (Rosa, 1909), The Karamazov Brothers by Dostoyevsky (Grushenka, 1910), Leo Tolstoy's The Living Corpse (Lisa Protasova, 1911). \\"The physical beauty, the reverberating nerve beat, the sharp perceptiveness\\" (according to the biographer Inna Solovyova) as well as her love of modernism ('decadent' was also the word that has been used to describe her close circle of friends) made Germanova one of the rising stars of the early 1900s' Russian theatre scene, and \\"a promising tragic actress in the vein of Duse\\". Anna Karenina, 1914 In 1914-1924 Germanova starred in five Russian silent films, starting with Anna Karenina in 1914, directed by Vladimir Gardin and produced by Paul Timan. In 1919 Germanova left Moscow, first for Kiev, then Rostov-on-Don. She joined the Kachalov Troupe and with it toured outside Soviet Russia in 1919‚Äî1922. During this time she revived most of her best-known parts of the past (Grushenka in The Karamazov Brothers, Ekaterina Ivanovna in Leonid Andreyev's eponymous play, Olga in Anton Chekhov's Three Sisters, Mamayeva in Ostrovsky's Enough Stupidity in Every Wise Man) and added to her repertoire Elena Andreyevna in Chekhov's Uncle Vanya. In 1922, along with several of her colleagues Germanova refused to return to Moscow. In 1923 Nemirovich-Danchenko sent her a telegram inviting her to take part in his new musical theatre project, but this offer was declined. Instead, Germanova arrived at Prague where her husband, the archeologist and art historian Alexander Kalitinsky has been lecturing at the Archeology Institute (which he in 1925 became the director of)–ù. –ï. –ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤. –ü—Ä–∞–∂—Å–∫–∏–µ –≥–æ–¥—ã // –ù–æ–≤—ã–π –ú–∏—Ä. 1994. ‚Ññ 11.] and soon, along with Nikolai Massalitinov, co-founded and became the director of what soon came to be known as the Prague MAT Troupe. Her repertoire now included also the parts of Ranevskaya (Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard), the Queen (The King of the Dark Chamber by Rabindranath Tagore), Ellida Wangel (The Lady from the Sea by Ibsen), Katerina (The Storm by Alexander Ostrovsky) and Medea by Euripides. After the Prague Troupe disbanded in 1927, Germanova took part in the productions staged by the Georges Pitoeff and Gaston Baty. In late 1920s she started working as theatre director herself. In 1929 she went to the US and that year succeeded Richard Boleslawski as the head of the American Laboratory Theatre, where she produced Chekhov's Three Sisters. The Lab, as it was known, disbanded in 1933, but proved to be an important link between Stanislavski and the New York's Group Theatre. Germanova died in Paris in 1940.

Biography Barker was born in the West Ham area of East London. During World War II she was evacuated to a rural farm where she contracted tuberculosis. This led to years of hospital treatment and long-term bone damage and arthritis. Despite missing long periods of schooling, Barker gained a scholarship to East Ham Grammar School for Girls in 1944. Between 1950 and 1955 she attended Walthamstow School of Art before taking a one-year teacher training qualification at the Leicester College of Art. In 1961 she married the artist and teacher Denis Barker and moved to Cumberland. She taught at both the University of Newcastle and at the Carlisle College of Art and began to develop installation pieces which she called environments and included compartmented assemblages. She invited performers and poets, including Adrian Henri, to participate in these events. One of her compartmented assemblages won the Abbot Hall Art Gallery prize in 1964. These works were too radical for the traditional Carlisle College authorities, who fired her. A brief spell in New York, working with Joseph Cornell, in 1966, followed. Late in 1967, Barker had an exhibition, shared with Sylvester Hou√©dard, at the Lisson Gallery which featured assemblages some of which she displayed in compartmented trays. A series of further illnesses limited Barker's artistic output throughout the 1970s but she and her husband did establish a business, Barkers of Lanercost that produced period costume dolls, soft toys and reproductions of artefacts from the Roman fort at Vindolanda. As the business developed, the couple purchased and restored a mill building at Lanercost which they developed into a small arts centre and work space for people with disabilities. The business collapsed in 1987 and the couple divorced shortly after. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Barker began to develop a series multisensory installations that explored ideas about disability and accessibility. The largest of these was the Festival of the Five Senses which, in 1989, filled a leisure centre in Hexham with artists, actors and musicians. The installation attracted large crowds and the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London were keen to host the work but Barker refused as the space offered was not fully accessible. Her final installation was Art: An Illusion at the Keswick Art Gallery in 2000. In 1993, Barker accepted a women of the decade award from the Arts Council for her work on disabilities and the arts but is understood to have refused the award of an MBE.

Her sinking on May 16, 2014 resulted in an extended debate over the safety of modern sailing boats. The yacht lost her keel about 720 nautical miles Southeast of Nova Scotia and subsequently capsized. Rescue services found her upturned hull before it sank but the crew ‚Äì four English men ‚Äì were never found.  The yacht  Cheeki Rafiki was a B√©n√©teau First 40.7, which had been built 2006 in B√©n√©teau's shipyard in Saint-Hilaire-de-Riez, France. She was about 12 meters long. She had been delivered to the customer in December 2006, who planned to enter her in charter regattas around Great Britain. In 2011, Stormforce Coaching took over the management of the yacht, but not her ownership. Subsequently, they entered the yacht twice for the Atlantic Rally for Cruisers (ARC), in the autumns of 2011 and 2013. After each of these crossings, she stayed in the Caribbean Sea for a few months. The tragedy happened during the journey home in early 2014. Central to the later investigation was the construction of the hull and especially the link between the hull and the so- called \\"matrix\\", an inner layer that was embedded in the lower part of the hull to give it the necessary stability and stiffness. The keel was secured to the hull by ten bolts; nine of them 24mm in diameter and one 14mm. They were laminated into the keel, and put through the outer hull, the matrix, and a steel washer, and then secured with nuts. The building process and the construction fulfilled the CE-seaworthiness Classification of category A (ocean), in the version valid at the time of building. Additionally, the construction process had been surveyed by Bureau Veritas.  The accident  USS Oscar Austin sends a diver to the upturned hull of Cheeki Rafiki Cheeki Rafiki had participated in the Antigua Sailing Week event in spring 2014 and was supposed to return to Southampton, England afterwards, to be available as charter yacht the following season. She left Antigua on May, 4 with a crew of four men on board. The voyage was expected to take about 30 days. During the voyage, the skipper exchanged emails with the director of Stormforce over satellite phone, especially about route suggestions and weather reports. Initially, there was not much wind, but it was constantly increasing after May 10. On May 16, the wind blew with Force 7 and a considerable sea had built up. The skipper reported to shore that the ship was taking on significant amounts of water for no apparent reason. A later phone call was incomprehensible, such that the director called MRCC Falmouth for help. A search-and-rescue operation was started. RCC Boston, responsible for the area in question, sent out a HC-130 Long Range Surveillance Aircraft. They were looking for a disabled yacht and persons in the water, since two PLB devices had sent emergency signals. The aircraft crew identified only debris at the expected position. On May 17, more than 24 hours after the last contact with the ship, the container vessel Maersk Kure identified Cheeki Rafikis hull, upside-down. The keel was missing, but the rudder was still in place. Due to bad weather conditions, the wreck could not be investigated further. Only about one week later could a ship of the US Navy send a diver to the still-floating wreck. This confirmed the life raft was still secured to its storage location; the crew had not had the time to bring it out. Consequently, the search was terminated, because any hope of finding the crew alive was in vain. The maximum time somebody can survive in water of 16 ¬∞C is about 15.5 hours.According to an estimate of RCC Boston, see MAIB-Report, Page 13  Investigation  The accident resulted in heated discussion amongst yachtsmen over the safety of sailboats and particularly over the construction and dimensioning of the connection between keel and hull, which had obviously failed in this case, but is of utmost importance for a sailing vessel. There were speculations whether the shipyard had fallen below the margins for required hull stability to cut costs as a measure to win customers in the highly competitive market for affordable yachts. The report of the British Marine Accident Investigation Branch showed that the construction did satisfy the relevant construction specifications available at the time of construction. It even almost passed the revised ones at the time of the accident. Therefore, the shipyard could not be held liable for the lack of stability. Furthermore, the crew could also not be blamed for the accident, because they were competent and the skipper was in the possession of all required certificates for such a voyage. At the time of the accident, the wind blew with force 7, which is rough but still completely within the limits for which such boats are constructed. The accident investigation report points out though, that it's unclear whether the ship was even allowed to set to sea under applicable laws. This because, as a professionally skippered boat, there are extensive rules concerning equipment, crewing and yearly safety inspections. The latter was overdue, but the operator was intending to postpone the inspection until the boat was back in England, so that he could avoid the costs of having to fly an inspector to the Caribbean. Close up picture of Cheeki Rafikis hull, where the keel had been. It is visible that the inner hull has separated from the outer and that the bolts including the washers are completely missing. The investigation report then tries to evaluate why the keel actually separated, even though technically, computationally and based on the weather at the place of incident there was no obvious reason for this. The wreck of the Cheeki Rafiki was not available for investigation, as it has not been found yet. So the MAIB had to find their conclusions from the few pictures of the rescue crews, the history of the boat and reports from sister ships. It was known that she had had a few groundings prior to the accident ‚Äì experts investigated by the MAIB said that this was not uncommon for ships participating in races. The connection between hull, matrix and keel had been repaired several times already. Even experts are not normally capable of telling how such a repair would be properly done and how to tell that it was acceptably fixed. The recommendation from the manufacturer to remove the keel completely was considered best practice, its cost-effectiveness was questioned though.Report on the investigation of the loss of the yacht Cheeki Rafiki and its four crew in the Atlantic Ocean, Report 8/2015 Online The report concludes that the most probable cause for the accident was a failure of the glued link between the \\"matrix\\" (inner skeleton) and the outer hull. Similar damages could be observed in sister ships which where involved in groundings, too. Different repair yards said that they could only hardly determine the severity of such damages. Also, a skipper cannot easily determine whether a \\"light\\" grounding had caused any damage. The report states that \\"Almost all [yacht owners and professional yacht skippers asked] agreed that groundings can occur when racing, and that if, in their opinion, it was a ‚Äòlight‚Äô grounding, no inspection for damage was necessary\\", while at the same time, there are several definitions for a \\"light grounding\\": * a grounding where the vessel did not stop; * where the vessel only ‚Äòbounced‚Äô over the bottom; * where no person was knocked off their feet as a result of the grounding; * where the vessel grounded at slow speed; and * where the vessel grounded on a soft bottom e.g. sand.MAIB-Report, Page 28 It is assumed that the structural damages in the hull of Cheeki Rafiki had not been sufficiently repaired after the previous groundings, such that the stability of the glued hull was compromised. It couldn't withstand the force of the increasing waves. The pictures show that the layers of the hull had separated. Some bolts could also have failed due to corrosion. The extensive report gives many recommendations for improvements. However, it does not ask for increased stability requirements for keel-to-hull constructions.  Prosecution  Shortly after the report was published operating company Stormforce and its director Douglas Innes were charged, with Innes facing four counts of manslaughter by gross negligence. He was accused of insufficient maintenance to cut costs. The yacht was, according to the Crown Prosecution Service, not seaworthy for an ocean passage, as several bolts of the keel were corroded or broken even before the voyage: \\"A number of keel bolts had broken, causing it to detach from the hull. Many were broken and it had been like that for months. The yacht was therefore unsound, broken, and unsafe before the men left from Antigua.\\" Innes pleaded not guilty. The jury at Winchester Crown Court acquitted Innes of manslaughter, but they did find him and the company guilty of unsafe operation of the vessel and of failing to fulfill the requirements of the Merchant Shipping Act. On May 11, 2018 Innes received a suspended sentence whilst his bankrupt firm Stormforce was fined ¬£50,000.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-44077513  References  Sources  * Report on the investigation of the loss of the yacht Cheeki Rafiki and its four crew in the Atlantic Ocean, approximately 720 miles east-south-east of Nova Scotia, Canada on 16 May 2014; Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) Report 8/2015 Report (PDF), with Annexes (PDF, english). * Lessons from Losses At Sea: ‚ÄúCheeki Rafiki‚Äù Report Misses An Opportunity to Make Boats Safer; Attainable Adventure Cruising; Juni 2016.

The festival is the most important Poya (full moon) holiday of the year and the second most important Buddhist holiday of the year, being surpassed in importance by Vesak. Poson is celebrated throughout the island, with the most important ceremonies of the festival being held in Anuradhapura and Mihintale. The festival is held in early June, coinciding with the June full moon.  Festival  Poson is celebrated to commemorate the introduction of Buddhism to Sri Lanka by Mahinda in 236 BC. The focal point of the religious festival is the Buddhist monastic complex on the mountain of Mihintale, where Arahath Mahinda Thero preached Buddhism to one of the kings of Sri Lanka. Celebrations are also centered around Buddhist sites in Anuradhapura, which was one of the first cities in Sri Lanka to convert to Buddhism. During Poson, these two locations attract thousands of pilgrims from across Sri Lanka. These pilgrims dress in white and worship at the spiritual locales. Many of the most devoted pilgrims spend hours in quiet contemplation to honor the traditions of Buddhism. Outside of Anuradhapura and Mihintale, the festival is celebrated with the telling of stories, music, dancing, the giving of free food and teas (provided by special vendors known as Dansals), and the hanging of paper lanterns.

Kopelman's musical education started with piano lessons and she is listed as a \\"notable alumna of Israel Arts and Science Academy\\", where she studied with prof. Andre Hajdu, prof. Bat-Sheva Rubinstein and prof. Michael Wolpe. She holds degrees in composition from Jerusalem Music and Dance Academy, Bar-Ilan University (MA Summa Cum Laude, PhD in progress). She was a lecturer in Hed College of Music in 2003‚Äì2007 and a senior lecturer, as well as academic advisor and master-classes curator in Rimon School of Music in 2006‚Äì2014. She gives lectures and courses in major academic institutions in Israel, including Jerusalem Music and Dance Academy, Buchmann-Mehta School of Tel Aviv University, Haifa University, Levinsky College, Musrara College, Bar- Ilan University Music Department, Van Leer Institute, and more. As a Composer- in-Residence of the Jerusalem Symphony Kopelman enlarged (at least doubled) and significantly widened the Israeli music repertoire performed by the orchestra, allowing many young composers as well as to female composers to be performed by a professional symphony orchestra for their first time. In 2019-2020 she was a recipient of two prestigious residencies: one was at Magnes Museum of the University of California, Berkeley and the Israel Institute. The other one was six months residency in Cite Internationale des Arts, Paris.  Selected concert works  Kopelman's concert music includes a commissioned work \\"Widows & Lovers\\" for the Kronos Quartet, as forth recipient of the \\"Kronos: Under 30‚Äù project, where she was competing with over 200 composers from all over the world. The piece was widely performed and later workshopped by Kronos after the premiere at the Carnegie Hall, by ensembles such as the Ragazze Quartet and young Israeli musicians. The third movement of the piece, \\"Black Widow,\\" is often performed as an independent piece, and was arranged and performed by the Swedish string orchestra Kvinnoorkestern. Kopelman's instrumental concert music includes works written for and performed by the Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Competition, the Cremona Quartet, Jerusalem Trio, Conjunto Iberico Octet, the Israel Camerata, Israeli Chamber Orchestra, Raanana Symphonette, the Israel Sinfonietta Beer Sheva, Carmel Quartet, the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra, Waterloo Soloists, Gavriel Lipkind, Noam Buchman, Eyal Shiloach, and many more. Her vocal concert music is set primarily to Hebrew and Russian poetry, often combining different languages in one piece. An early example includes the song cycle \\"Songs of Love and Distress\\" for voice and piano/string quartet, combining Akhmatova's, Wallach's, Avidan's and Kopelman's texts in poly-stylistic and painful piece. Another large work is the Hebrew Magnificat for SATB choir and orchestra, originally performed in 2005 by the Tel-Aviv Chamber Choir, and later edited and re-orchestrated for symphonic orchestra (2017, JSO). The piece, 37 minutes long, is set to Latin, German and Hebrew texts and deals with various aspects of maternity as it appears in the eyes of the 21st century. Later writing is less European concert-music oriented and includes elements from popular music, especially in the rhythmic aspect. Examples include \\"Grief Measure,\\" commissioned by the Carnegie Hall for Professional Training Workshop with Dawn Upshaw, that includes besides voice also drums, bass, and electronics, \\"Sooner and Later\\" (2019) for soprano, string orchestra, percussion and drums is set on Leah Goldberg's poems, and was commissioned by the Israel Chamber Orchestra marking 50 years since Goldberg's passing, \\"Belong Not\\" for girls choir and handbells was co-commissioned by San Francisco Girls Chorus and the Israel Institute, and is set on Kopelman's arrangement of Khalil Gibran's poem \\"On Children.\\" The piece was premiered in a special cooperation event of San Francisco Girls Chorus and Berkeley Ballet Theatre, for the centennial of the 19th Amendment to the United States constitution in Yerba Buena Arts Center, SF. The piece was choreographed by Chuck Wilt and Robert Dekkers. Symphonic pieces include \\"May They Rest in Peace\\" (2002), \\"Between Gaza and Berlin\\" (2014), and \\"Ode to Jerusalem\\" (2019), all dealing with or referring to the complex political situation in Israel. The title of the second deterred both the IPO (according to Zubin Mehta) and the Israeli Opera from performing it in Israel. Additional orchestral works include Concerto for Flute (2017) for symphony orchestra and \\"Kan Ya Ma Kan - Once Upon a Time\\" (2004) - a concerto for oud, violin and string orchestra.  Non-concert music  Except for concert music, Kopelman is a songwriter, an album of which, is expected to be released in 2020. Another notable project was forming the Jazz Fusion ensemble ensemble named Turquoise Project (brass and rhythm section), for which she wrote and performed a full show program; part of it was studio recorded. In many of her concert music pieces too, she blurs the common division of concert and non-concert medium by using contemporary rock and pop melodies, harmonies, rhythm and instrumentation, and also cooperates with non-classical musicians such as Yair Dalal and Sameer Makhoul on oud, the Rock-Blues singer Ruth Dolores Weiss, the experimental guitarist Yonatan Albalak, electronic music artist Sacha Terrat, Jazz flutist Ilan Salem, and more. Kopelman wrote as well experimental music for violin and Max/MSP.

The current building dates to the 18th century and houses a museum. The schloss is part of Pyrmont Fortress (Festung Pyrmont) which dates to the 16th century.  History = Fortress and Renaissance castle = The fortress and Renaissance castle before the Thirty Years' War Between 1526 and 1536, Count Frederick VI of Spiegelberg, overlord of the County of Pyrmont, built a fortress and schloss in valley of Pyrmont. He had experience in the construction of the fortress when he had reinforced Coppenbr√ºgge Castle with walls and roundels. The fortress of Pyrmont was almost square in shape with a 40-metre-wide moat. The walls had casemates and a stone corner bastion, which echoes the Italian style of fortification. Access to the fortress was via a wooden bridge and later a drawbridge. Buildings were built inside the walls and, in the south-western area, the first schloss was built. Following the completion of the castle in 1536, it was garrisoned by Count Frederick VI, who resided in neighbouring L√ºgde. Later the schloss became the side wing of a larger schloss, which his son, Philip, had built in 1557 in the Weser Renaissance style. According to tradition, this was a three-storey building with three wall dormers, similar to the H√§melschenburg. In addition, a tower was built for archiving documents. Philip died before the completion of the Renaissance schloss. The building was completed by the husband of his sister, Hermann Simon of Lippe. Afterwards the counts of Lippe and the counts of Gleichen resided at the schloss. In 1625, Count Hans Louis of Gleichen transferred the County of Pyrmont to the Count of Waldeck. During the Thirty Years' War, the succession dispute between the Bishopric of Paderborn and the Counts of Waldeck revived. For the Bishopric, troops under General Pappenheim, besieged the Pyrmont fortress in 1629, and its 400-man garrison surrendered after ten months. In 1633, Swedish troops recaptured the fortress, which was reconquered in 1636 by the Imperial Army. After being taken again by the Swedes in 1646, the fortress was handed over to the Counts of Waldeck in 1649. The schloss suffered damage as a result of the sieges. Rebuilt in haste, it served as a summer residence for the counts of Waldeck, but it was also neglected in the period that followed and began to deteriorate. When Count Anthony Ulrich of Waldeck-Pyrmont took over the regency of Waldeck and Pyrmont in 1706, master builder, Hermann Korb, built a new schloss in the Baroque style. The new building was erected between 1706 and 1710 on the basement and other parts of the earlier residence. As early as 1721, architect, Julius Ludwig Rothweil, extended the building. A commander's house, two cavalier houses and a magazine were built. The fortifications were overhauled. In addition, the Baroque gardens were redesigned. Further changes followed in 1765 under the direction of Franz Friedrich Rothweil. Between 1852 and 1855, several buildings were added and the schloss given its present appearance.

After the war, the British Red Cross remained in the castle until 1948. In 1956, the state of Lower Saxony acquired the fortress and castle from the princely family of Waldeck and Pyrmont. The first redevelopment took place from 1960 to 1962; another followed from 1978. From 1984 to 1987, architect Karl-Heinz Lorey renovated and redesigned the schloss and fortifications for use by the then district folk high school and as a museum.Friedrich Lindau: Hanover.

The ruins were designated a National Historic Site in 1940 by the Japanese government. Situation Namioka Castle is located on a fluvial terrace of the Namioka River, in former Namioka town, south of the center of Aomori city. The location is roughly long and narrow diamond which commands a central location to cover the entry to the Tsugaru Plain from the east. The castle consisted of eight motte-and-bailey enclosures, approximately 800 meters long by 800 meters wide. The Kitayakata (North Residence) served as the inner bailey, and did not contain a tenshu. The outer enclosures included the Nishiyakata (West Residence), Higashiyakata (East Residence), Uchiyakata (Inner Residence), Shinyakata (New Residence), etc. As was typical for the time, each enclosure had its own fortifications, which consisted primarily of wooden palisades and earthen ramparts, guarded by a double moat directly connected to the Namioka River. The moats were 20 meters wide by 5 meter deep. The j≈çkamachi contained streets built in a grid pattern similar to that of Kyoto  History  Namioka Castle was constructed around 1373, during the early Nanboku-ch≈ç period, by the Namioka-Kitabatake clan. During the struggles between Emperor Go-Daigo and Ashikaga Takauji, Kitabatake Akiie, who had been sent to rule northern Japan from Taga Castle was appointed Chinjufu-sh≈çgun. In December 1335, Kitabatake Akiie and his father Kitabatake Chikafusa drove Ashikaga Takauji from Kyoto to Kyushu. However, Takauji was able to raise a new army the following year, and after defeating Emperor Go-Daigo at the Battle of Minatogawa, was able to drive him into exile in Yoshino. Kitabatake Akiie was subsequently defeated by the forces of K≈ç no Moronao at the Battle of Ishizu in 1338. His younger brother, Kitabatake Akinobu was also unable to hold Taga Castle and other strongholds against the victorious Ashikaga forces and fled to the far north of Honsh≈´, seeking the protection of the Nanbu clan based at Sannohe Castle and the And≈ç clan who controlled Tosaminato on the Sea of Japan and changed his family name to ‚ÄúNamioka‚Äù. In 1562, during the Sengoku period, there was an internal conflict within the Namioka clan, in which Namioka Tomokazu (1532-1562) was killed. Although the revolt was suppressed, the weakened Namioka clan was unable to resist an attack in 1578 by Oura Tamenobu, who had seized the Tsugaru region and declared independence from the Nanbu. The castle was abandoned soon thereafter.  Current situation  In 1940 the site of Namioka Castle was proclaimed a National Historic Site with a designated area of approximately 136,300 square meters (1.2 km east-west, 600 m north-south). The site of the castle remains in ruins, with only about 30 percent excavated; however, public access is permitted and there is a museum at the site. Recovered artifacts number more than 50,000 items such as tableware, cooking utensils, weapons, farming tools, and religious implements. The ruins are approximately a 20 minute walk from the JR East Namioka Station. The castle was listed as one of the Continued Top 100 Japanese Castles in 2017.

It is also the sixth book in the Gray Man series. Picking up after the events of Back Blast, Court Gentry, back in the employ of the Central Intelligence Agency after five years as a fugitive, has to capture a rogue hacker working for the Chinese military who is on the run from his former employers. The book was dedicated to prominent thriller writer Dalton Fury, who died in 2016. The novel debuted at number 10 at The New York Times Bestseller list.  Plot summary  For his first operation back with the Central Intelligence Agency, Court Gentry is tasked with capturing Fan Jiang, a former member of PLA Unit 61398, an ultra-secret computer warfare unit responsible for testing China‚Äôs own security systems, through his former handler Sir Donald Fitzroy, who was contracted by the Chinese government for a similar operation, in Hong Kong. Unbeknownst to him, his arrival in the country was discovered by the Ministry of State Security (MSS), who then sent two agents to surveil him. Their principal boss from the Ministry of Defense (MOD), Colonel Dai Longhai, becomes frustrated about this routine surveillance op and orders them to eliminate Gentry, who instead manages to kill them. After the attempt on his life, Gentry decides to go dark in order to go on with his operation. His later inquiries on the whereabouts of Fitzroy attracted Colonel Dai‚Äôs attention, who then ordered his henchmen to kidnap Gentry. Court is then brought to Fitzroy, who also had been kidnapped by Colonel Dai. Sir Donald had dispatched two kill teams for Fan on behalf of Colonel Dai‚Äôs MOD, but they were killed by the Wo Shing Wo, a part of the Triad criminal organization in Hong Kong whom Fan had hired for protection while on the run. After hearing of his failure, Colonel Dai takes Fitzroy hostage and has decided to supervise the hunt. Aware of his reputation as the Gray Man and his past relationship with Fitzroy, but unaware that Gentry is working on behalf of the CIA, Colonel Dai hires Court to find Fan and eliminate him. Gentry follows up on the last lead on Fan, in which the hacker had escaped the city by ship in the island of Po Toi with the help of Wo Shing Wo. After a violent bar fight, he finds out that Fan had in fact escaped to Vietnam and is now under the protection of the Con Ho Hoang Da (Wild Tigers), a Vietnamese criminal organization. Unbeknownst to him, a secret Russian foreign intelligence (SVR) paramilitary unit led by intelligence officer Zoya Zakharova was also interested in locating Fan, and had in fact located the ship first after having raided it. They also gleaned the same information from interrogating the ship‚Äôs captain at the same time that Court found out about Fan‚Äôs whereabouts. Court, as well as Zoya‚Äôs team, goes to Vietnam to continue his hunt. He plans to infiltrate the Wild Tigers‚Äôs known headquarters in Ho Chi Minh City in order to capture Fan. However, an impatient Colonel Dai sends a paramilitary force to the HQ in an attempt to capture Fan without consulting Court, leaving Gentry to give chase to a black sedan (which, unbeknownst to him, was carrying Wild Tigers leader Tu Van Duc) escaping from the building into a Wild Tigers compound near the Cambodian border. However, Zoya‚Äôs team was one step ahead of Gentry once again, as she determined the compound to be Fan‚Äôs hiding place from interrogating a Vietnamese police officer who was on the Wild Tigers‚Äôs payroll. Her team infiltrate the compound that night, which turned into a full scale gunfight with the Wild Tigers, as well as soldiers from the People‚Äôs Army of Vietnam (PAVN) who were there as extra protection for Fan. Court eventually finds Fan trying to escape the compound with Tu Van Duc and one of his henchmen, and captures him while killing his protectors, but not before evading the Russian paramilitary unit trying to extract the hacker and kill him in the process. After the attack on the compound, which had failed to capture Fan once again and killed one of her men, Zoya was recalled to Moscow for seemingly ordering her men to storm the compound even though they were outnumbered by PAVN forces (although she was not really supervising the operation; Vasily, the team leader of the SVR Zaslon paramilitary unit, ordered the raid). Now desperate and wanting to salvage her mission on her own, Zoya tries to recruit the services of the Chamroon Syndicate, a Thai criminal organization, but is later burned by the SVR for not reporting in to her employers sooner. Meanwhile, while making their way to Cambodia, Fan tells Court why he defected from China. When his parents died in a car accident, leaving him with no family members and making him liable to be executed according to the ‚Äúfamily collateral‚Äù rule among members of unit 61398 (hackers with no next of kin are deemed untrustworthy by the government), Fan was helped by his parents‚Äôs guardian Song Julong, later deduced by Court to be a double agent working for the CIA, in defecting from China. He originally wanted to go to Taiwan through Hong Kong with Taiwanese papers provided by a contact of Song‚Äôs, but he was left behind in the border when Colonel Dai‚Äôs men chased him. Court finds out that he did not know the full story about his mission. Court and Fan were captured soon after by river bandits, whom Fan deduced were Thai smugglers. Court was forced to leave Fan behind when he escaped, but he was rescued by the United States Navy in lieu of his CIA handler Suzanne Brewer. Court decides to go to Bangkok, Thailand to resume his search for Fan and prevent Sir Fitzroy from getting killed by the Colonel Dai, who had tortured Fitzroy and was by now getting desperate. The CIA intercepts an encrypted message from Fan to Taiwanese authorities which reveals that he is under captivity from the Chamroon Syndicate, which has its headquarters in Bangkok. Court tries to capture one of its operational leaders, Nattapong Chamroon, in a nightclub, and then interrogate him on Fan‚Äôs whereabouts. He informs Colonel Dai of his operation, who then sends some of his men to the club. Unfortunately, the Russian paramilitary team (now led by SVR operations officer Oleg Utkin) is also present with the same objective. Once again impatient, Colonel Dai orders his men, led by his second in command Major Xi, to storm the nightclub in pursuit of Fan and Chamroon‚Äôs senior leadership. Major Xi‚Äôs men find themselves in a violent gunfight with the Thai gangsters and Oleg‚Äôs forces. Meanwhile, Court manages to rescue Chamroon from the gunfight as well as his five surviving call girls. However, the last call girl he saves turns out to be Zoya, who then takes the Thai gangster away from Court. Zoya then presses Chamroon for Fan‚Äôs whereabouts, and when he told her that his brother Kulap is with the hacker, she kills him and then exits the nightclub, where she then makes contact with her surviving paramilitary team and escapes the nightclub with them. In the car, Zoya and Utkin argue about the failed operation, but when Utkin tried to kill the burned SVR operative, Zoya kills him. Meanwhile, Court had found Chamroon‚Äôs dead body and had also exited the nightclub. He then finds Zoya tending to his former teammates, and follows them using a tracking device. After hearing of her colleague‚Äôs death, he captures her, but then decides to enlist her help in finding Fan. Zoya and Court go to the island of Phuket, Thailand, where the Chamroon estate is located. The two get close over the course of two days surveilling the estate, and Court recruits Zoya into the CIA as an asset. Meanwhile, his handler Brewer informs him that Fan had sent an encrypted message, this time to the U.S. embassy in Bangkok, asking to be rescued from the Chamroon estate, and that CIA Ground Branch operatives are supervising his rescue instead of Court. Rather, Court would take charge of Zoya. After his call, however, Zoya and Court are kidnapped by Major Xi‚Äôs men under orders from Colonel Dai, who is also in Phuket. They were put in a ranch house, where the colonel tells Court that he himself will supervise the attack into the Chamroon estate, and that he and his Russian girlfriend will stay behind until the operation is over. Fitzroy was also present in the house, and he tells Gentry that he was originally contracted by the MI6 to assassinate Song before he kills Fan‚Äôs parents, but the kill team he sent spooked Song in Shanghai, leading him to kill Fan‚Äôs parents in order to force the hacker‚Äôs defection to the United States. Court reveals his identity as the Gray Man to Zoya. Then they deduce that the encrypted e-mail from Fan is a red herring, since they both know that the hacker truly wanted to go to Taiwan instead of being rescued by the United States. They further conclude that Kulap Chamroon forced Fan to send the encrypted e-mail from a nearby yacht, which he later learns is owned by Italian crime syndicate 'Ndrangheta which has business ties to Kulap, in order to lead the Chinese into an ambush as revenge for his brother‚Äôs death. They later escape the ranch house, leaving Fitzroy behind, and decide to infiltrate the yacht and rescue Fan themselves. Court had made contact with Brewer and tells her to abort the CIA Ground Branch‚Äôs impending raid on the estate, which would have led to a violent gun battle between them and Colonel Dai‚Äôs forces as well as an ambush from Chamroon‚Äôs men. Meanwhile, Colonel Dai‚Äôs men were brutally ambushed by Thai insurgents hired by Kulap in his own estate. After rescuing Fan, Court calls Colonel Dai and arranges for a prisoner exchange with Fan and Fitzroy. However, Court decides to go off grid with Fan, and leaves Zoya to be rescued by the CIA. Days later, Court contacts his boss in the CIA, Matthew Hanley, who confirms his suspicions about his operation. Then Hanley calls in the CIA Ground Branch team to try to extract Gentry from where he is calling, which is in a hotel in Phang Nga, Thailand. However, the paramilitary unit end up rescuing Fitzroy from Colonel Dai‚Äôs men, killing Major Xi in the process. Three days later, Court enlists Fitzroy‚Äôs help in securing Fan‚Äôs move to Taiwan. However, when Court sends Fan off to Taiwanese intelligence officers in an airport, they were both captured by the CIA Ground Branch team. After being whisked into the plane, Court then finds out that Fan will be forced to work for the United States since he is safer with them, and that Colonel Dai made a deal with the CIA to escape death in the hands of the Chinese military for failing to capture Fan. After meeting with Zoya in Frankfurt, Germany before she gets shipped off in order to be vetted into the CIA, Court goes off grid.

A fellow of Hertford College, Oxford from 1924 to 1959, he was known for his works on English legal history and for his textbook on English contract law, commonly known as Cheshire and Fifoot's Law of Contract, now in its seventeenth edition.  Life and career  Cecil Fifoot was born in Penarth, near Cardiff, the son of Sydney Fifoot, manager of the Great Western Colliery Company, and of Maria Trevor. He was educated at Berkhamsted School, before being commissioned into the Royal Field Artillery in 1917, aged 18. He was sent with a mortar unit to France, where he was injured in July 1918, leaving him partially deaf, and spent the rest of the war in hospital. In 1919, Fifoot entered Exeter College, Oxford as a History scholar, before switching to Jurisprudence. He studied under Geoffrey Cheshire, with whom he later co-authored an influential work on the law of contract. Fifoot took first-class honours in Jurisprudence in 1921 and was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1922. He began to practice in South Wales, before giving up legal practice in 1924 and accepting a tutorial fellowship at Hertford College, Oxford, where he remained a fellow until his retirement 1959. Among his students were Carl Albert and Sir Ian Brownlie. Fifoot was a renowned lecturer: his lectures were said to be so popular that it was common practice for the windows of the Old Hall of Lincoln's Inn to be opened when he was lecturing there, so as to allow those standing outside to hear him. At Oxford, he was University Lecturer in Law from 1930 until 1945, when he was appointed All Souls Reader in English Law. He was also Reader in Common Law to the Inns of Court from 1954 to 1967. He delivered the Hamlyn Lectures in 1959 and the David Murray Lecture at Glasgow University in 1970. In addition, Fifoot was Oxford's Senior Proctor from 1935 to 1936, Bursar of Hertford College from 1926 to 1934, and Dean from 1940 to 1944. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1954 and an honorary fellow of Hertford College in 1962. In 1959 Fifoot retired to Eastbourne, but continued to lecture for the Inns of Court until 1967. He moved to Edinburgh in 1969, where he died in 1975. = Family = Fifoot married Hj√∂rdis Baars, younger daughter of Dr Eriksen of Kongsberg, Norway, in 1924. Their only son, Richard Fifoot, was Bodley's Librarian from 1979 to 1981.  Scholarship  Fifoot was known as a historian of English law. An admirer of F. W. Maitland, Fifoot authored a biography of Maitland (Frederic William Maitland: A Life, 1971) and edited his letters for the Selden Society. He also wrote two monographs on the development of English law and a biography of Lord Mansfield. Fifoot was also an important contract law scholar. His textbook on the English contract law, The Law of Contract (1946), co-authored with his former tutor Geoffrey Cheshire, quickly became a leading textbook on the subject. Originally known as Cheshire and Fifoot's Law of Contract, it is now in its seventeenth edition (2017) as Cheshire, Fifoot, and Furmston's Law of Contract.

The other five passengers on board, forming the core of his Embassy Hill Formula One team, were also killed. The group was returning from a trip to southern France to test the new Hill GH2, one month after the end of the 1975 Formula One season. The accident occurred at night, and at the time foggy conditions prevailed in the area. An investigation into the crash was inconclusive, but pilot error was deemed the most likely explanation.  Aircraft  The accident aircraft was a Piper PA-23-250D Aztec built in 1968 and registered It was sold by Melridge Aviation in April 1972 to Grand Prix (Bahamas) Ltd and a request was made to remove the aircraft from the FAA register. This did not actually take place until August 1974. The aircraft was legally stateless from April 1972, although its former registration N6645Y continued to be displayed. The aircraft was operating without a certificate of airworthiness as that held had ceased to be effective when the aircraft was removed from the FAA register. At the time of the accident, the aircraft had flown 1,131 hours.  Background  The GH2 racing car that was being tested in France. On 28 November, the day before the accident, Hill had flown his Aztec to Le Castellet Airport, next to the Paul Ricard Circuit in southern France. On board were five other members of the Embassy Hill team: mechanic Tony Alcock, team driver Tony Brise, team manager Ray Brimble, mechanic Terry Richards and car designer Andrew Smallman. The group were at the Paul Ricard Circuit to test the team's new Hill GH2 racing car. They were scheduled to return on 30 November, but the test was curtailed. Photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones (Lord Snowdon) had considered flying with the group, but did not go as he felt that he had already taken enough photographs.  Accident  At 15:30 GMT on 29 November, the group departed from Le Castellet and flew to Marseille- Marignane Airport. Hill visited the self-briefing room and obtained weather reports for the London area. An IFR flight plan was filed for a flight to Elstree Airfield, with Luton Airport as alternate. The Piper Aztec took off from Marseille at 17:47. Contact was made with London Air Traffic Control Centre at 20:45 and a weather report for Elstree was obtained, giving a visibility of 2,000 metres and a cloud base of 300 ft AGL. At 21:19, the aircraft was passed to London Heathrow Approach and Hill was informed that visibility at Elstree was 1,000 metres. At 21:21, having descended to passing south of Lambourne VOR, Hill was informed that visibility at Elstree had reduced to 800 metres. The aircraft was subsequently cleared to descend to , below which any further descent was at the pilot's discretion. At 21:28, the London Approach controller contacted N6645Y to pass further information; there was no reply. Shortly afterwards, radar contact was lost. The Aztec, already with its landing gear and flaps extended, brushed the top of a large tree at an elevation of AMSL within Arkley Golf Course, to the east and above Elstree airfield. It then descended further, colliding with more trees, rolling to the right, striking the ground with its wing tip and finally crashing into a copse. An intense fire developed after the impact, which destroyed most of the aircraft. All six occupants were instantly killed. Elstree's runway was equipped with edge lights and a low-intensity visual slope indicator, but lacked any radio aid and there were no published instrument approach procedures for the airfield, making it unsuitable for low-visibility operations. Witnesses near the crash site reported that weather conditions at the time were thick fog, with a visibility of 50 to 100 metres. Around three hours earlier, a pilot of another light aircraft had attempted three approaches into Elstree, assisted with radar headings and distances to the airfield provided by London Approach. On all three attempts, descending to as low as AGL, the airfield lights either remained not visible or were spotted too late to proceed with the landing. The pilot eventually diverted to another airport. Visibility above the cloud layer at AMSL, was reported as very good.  Investigation  The Accidents Investigation Branch (now Air Accidents Investigation Branch) conducted the investigation. Their report was published on 29 September 1976. It revealed that the aircraft was unregistered and stateless, although it had been well maintained. It also determined that Hill's night flying and instrument flying ratings had expired and were therefore invalid, as well as other licence irregularities. No mechanical defects were discovered that would have contributed to the accident. Pilot fatigue was not considered to be a factor, and post-mortem toxicological exams on all six victims were all negative. The exact cause of the accident could not be determined. The investigators offered three possible reasons for the pilot allowing the aircraft to descend into the ground: # Error in height interpretation ‚Äì In the final moments of the flight, the pilot may have misinterpreted the altimeter reading as height above ground (specifically above Elstree Airfield's elevation), as opposed to altitude above mean sea level. This possibility was considered unlikely. # Unawareness of altitude ‚Äì Descending from 1500 ft with clear sky into the underlying layer of fog, the pilot may have focussed his attention on establishing visual contact with the ground, neglecting to monitor the aircraft's instruments to maintain a safe altitude. # Error in range estimation ‚Äì When approaching Elstree's runway 27, a pilot would normally overfly the town of Borehamwood, followed by an unlit patch of land immediately before the airfield. However, N6645Y was approaching the airfield from a more southerly route, and the pilot may have mistaken the lights of Barnet, visible through the fog, for those of Borehamwood, and the adjacent Arkley Golf Course for the dark patch next to the airfield. This may have led him to believe to be much closer to the airfield than he actually was, and to prematurely initiate the final descent to land. This hypothesis was considered the most likely.  Aftermath  The Times reported that Hill may have over-estimated his flying ability. Hill's widow, Bette, was sued for damages by the administrators of Smallman's estate. A High Court writ was issued in June 1977. As Hill was uninsured, settling the case took a large portion of his money. Because the crash killed the majority of Graham Hill's own Formula One team Embassy Hill (including Hill himself and driver Tony Brise), this left the team with only the deputy team manager and two mechanics as its members. Embassy Hill could not continue to compete and soon the team closed down.

Known for her innovative experimentation with both natural and synthetic materials, Thorpe was a featured instructor and lecturer throughout the United States. She has weavings in the permanent collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. An annual award given in her honor is presented by the Institute of American Indian Arts for fiber arts. Early life Azalea Stuart Gray was born on 10 April 1911 on her family's estate, \\"Blinkbonnie\\", in Peebles, Scotland to Marion R. \\"May\\" and Andrew Gray. She immigrated in 1916, with her mother to the United States, joining their father in Flint, Michigan, where he was employed as a machinist in an automobile plant. After the family arrival, another daughter, Marcia was born. The girls attended public schools in Flint and at the age of eighteen, Gray was working in the automobile industry. By the mid-1930s, she had married Alfred E. Thorpe, moved to Ohio and in 1937, the couple had their daughter, Sheila. After Thorpe divorced, she moved to Europe, where she traveled extensively and studied French for eighteen months. Returning to the United States, she enrolled in a textile design course at Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, studying with Marianne Strengell. Career Upon her graduation from Cranbrook, Thorpe began teaching weaving techniques and by 1953, was conducting a speaking tour with exhibits on weaving. After several years of teaching at Cranbrook, she moved to Deer Isle, Maine, where she taught at the Haystack Mountain School of Crafts before moving to New York City around 1953. In New York, Thorpe opened a design studio in Manhattan at 10th Avenue and 57th Street, where she experimented with a range of both natural and synthetic fibers. She continued with her own education at the Scottish Woollen Technical College in Galashiels, Scotland and taught at the Fashion Institute of Technology in the 1950s. Thorpe was interested in textile manufacture for both industrial and home use. She designed fabrics for use in coats, drapery, rugs, and wall coverings as well as a special fabric for use with speakers which would not distort the transmission of sound. She participated as a technical advisor, along with Jack Lenor Larsen and Russel Wright, to the International Cooperation Administration. She was interested in varied dyeing techniques and conducted in-depth research on new types of materials, such as the natural protein fiber Vicara and corn fiber to determine its adaptability for both design and manufacture. Her research was conducted as a collaboration with the architect Kent Cooper. Displaying her work at craft fairs and exhibitions, in varied locations like Texas and Florida, she also juried events for the National Conference of American Craftsmen and the annual International Women's Exhibition, among others. In addition to her design work, Thorpe, who was a jazz enthusiast, wrote as a columnist at Downbeat Magazine. Meeting many of the noted musicians in the field, she worked as a personal manager for such artists as the De Paris Brothers, Sidney and Wilbur; Miles Davis; and Abbey Lincoln. She exhibited works at the Brussels World Fair in 1958 and toured Europe with the United States Information Service Exhibit. Her works were featured in major museum collections, such as a 1954 weaving in the permanent holdings of the Victoria and Albert Museum. In 1960, she was part of a New York State Education Department television series Adventures in Art where she discussed weaving. In 1962, Thorpe moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico and began teaching weaving at the newly founded Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA). She served as the chair of the fiber and textile arts department of IAIA, but continued to work on research projects in New York, like a 1964 study of South and Central American textiles. On 11 November 1966, Thorpe married Lloyd Kiva New, a Cherokee fashion designer. Thorpe left the IAIA in 1966, returning east to conduct seminars and study Southeastern weaving techniques. She published articles on the school and in 1967, co-authored the book Elements of Weaving with Jack Lenor Larsen and the following year returned as head of the fiber department at IAIA. In 1969, she designed the paraments for the Bethlehem Lutheran Church in Los Alamos, New Mexico. The initial hanging representing the Trinity was woven in browns, greens and rust hues. Additional hangings in red for Pentecost, violet for Advent and Lent, and a third in white for Christmas and Easter were also commissioned. That same year, she published a review of the exhibit Young Americans 1969, stressing that weaving was able to be both art and craft. Death and legacy Thorpe died on 29 December 1988 at her home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, after a lengthy illness with cancer. The Institute of American Indian Arts established the Azalea Thorpe New Memorial Award in her honor to recognize excellence in fiber arts.

It was notable for producing the first gatefold album packaging from an artist/group original to that country. Background Work on Studio was generally sporadic across 1967, with most of it being completed in the fall (October‚ÄìNovember). The album material was largely composed by vocalist and bassist G√∂ran Lagerberg, lead vocalist Tommy Blom, and producer Anders \\"Henkan\\" Henriksson, who also contributed keyboards and orchestral arrangements. Two of the album tracks, \\"Like A Woman\\" and \\"It's In A Dream,\\" were recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, England on 8‚Äì9 October 1967; the rest of the album was recorded at Europafilm Studios just outside of Stockholm. The track \\"She's Having A Baby Now\\" had been recorded in the spring of 1967 and released as a single on Parlophone in June, but was controversial upon release due its lyrical content, which was largely misunderstood. Lead vocalist Tommy Blom told Ugly Things magazine in 1988, \\"We had one release which was called \\"She's Having A Baby Now.\\" It was going to be released in England but was banned by the BBC. They didn't want to play that. It was controversial. 'She's Having A Baby...' If you listen to the words, it's actually socially pornographic. I don't know if you use the same words in English? We call an article a socially pornographic thing. It's not pornographic in the way of pornography. It's when they go into a family disaster and they exploit it.\\" The album is notable for being one of the first to include traditional Swedish instruments in its arrangements. According to Blom, \\"Some of the cuts from the album were very influenced by the Swedish traditional music. \\"Have You Seen Your Brother Lately\\" has some instruments which were used in ancient Swedish history. That was a bit before 1969 and 1970 when groups in Sweden got money from the Government‚Äîculture money‚Äîbecause they took Swedish folk music and turned it into rock and roll. They moved the traditional harmonies and things into rock and roll. We had already done that in 1968.\\" The album was released on the Parlophone label on December 4, 1967.

He has been Chief of Staff of the PLA Navy since January 2018, and previously served as Chief of Staff and Deputy Commander of the South Sea Fleet, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Southern Theater Command, and Commander of the North Sea Fleet (2017‚Äì2018). He commanded the PLA Navy's fifth Gulf of Aden anti-piracy task force in 2010. Biography Zhang was born in 1958 in Fuyang, Zhejiang Province. He spent most of his career in the South Sea Fleet (SSF), where he served as director of its ship training center, and commander of the 26th Speedboat Detachment. He rose to the position of deputy chief of staff of the SSF by 2010 and attained the rank of rear admiral the same year. From 4 March until 12 September 2010, Zhang commanded the PLA Navy's fifth Gulf of Aden anti-piracy task force to the seas near pirate-infested Somalia. The flotilla, consisting of the missile destroyer Guangzhou, the missile frigate Chaohu, and the replenishment ship Weishanhu, sailed a record-breaking distance of 92,495 nautical miles over 192 days, and completed 41 missions escorting 588 Chinese and foreign ships. Before its return, the task force made official visits to Egypt, Italy, Greece, and Myanmar, and paid a port call in Singapore. The mission received substantial media coverage in China. During the mission Zhang Wendan paid a visit to a Japanese warship after Japanese naval captain Minami Takanobu boarded the Chinese ship earlier. The two sides exchanged information on pirate activity, a rare occasion of military cooperation between the two countries. Zhang has enjoyed a rapid succession of promotions since March 2014, when he became chief of staff of the SSF. A year later he was appointed deputy commander of the SSF, and became deputy chief of staff of the Southern Theater Command by December 2016. Just a month later, he was transferred to the North Sea Fleet (NSF) to serve as its commander, succeeding Yuan Yubai, who had been promoted to commander of the Southern Theater Command. He served in the NSF for only a year, before being appointed Chief of Staff of the PLA Navy in January 2018, replacing vice-admiral Qiu Yanpeng.

It infests the sea cucumbers Eupentacta quinquesemita and Eupentacta pseudoquinquesemita in Puget Sound and other parts of the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Description The adult female Thyonicola americana bears little resemblance to a mollusc, having no shell and a coiled worm-like form. While living in the visceral tissues of its host, its central cavity is connected to the large intestine lumen of its host by a thin stalk, inside which is a tubule lined with cilia. The larvae are recognisable as mollusc larvae and have a shell and foot but no velum. They are benthic and move by crawling. Life cycle A female T. americana larva settles on a suitable host and undergoes metamorphosis into a juvenile which makes its way into the host's gut, possibly through the cloaca, and penetrates the gut wall. The adult female is a worm-like organism which when uncurled can be up to long. The male larva enters the central cavity of the adult female and undergoes metamorphosis into a dwarf adult; it then atrophies apart from its testicular tissues which fertilise the eggs produced by the female. After taking about six months to mature, the parasite can reproduce continually, reaching peak reproduction in late summer. As it matures, the ovaries develop and the interior cavity begins to accumulate egg capsules containing eggs and developing larvae. There may be about 500 capsules each containing 75 to 150 larvae. The larvae are liberated into the host's gut sequentially as they mature. In the autumn, most host sea cucumbers eviscerate, growing a new gut in the spring. Not all individuals eviscerate, but when this occurs, the parasite is expelled (due to its attachment to the gut wall) and dies, and any remaining egg capsules are liberated into the open sea. The parasite seems to be present only in sea cucumbers with entire guts, and more than one parasite may be present in one host. Ecology The adult T. americana lives attached to the hind third of the intestine of the sea cucumber Eupentacta quinquesemita, a common holothurian in the Pacific Northwest, and also to the closely related Eupentacta pseudoquinquesemita; in Puget Sound, 38% of the latter were found to be parasitised. E. quinquesemita exhibits a seasonal evisceration, expelling its guts in the autumn and growing a new set in the spring. However evisceration of the host results in the death of the parasite, and when this happens many individuals will not have reached full maturity and will fail to complete their life cycles.

After completing 815 sorties during the war, she was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 18 August 1945, making her the only woman from Chuvashia to receive the title.  Early life  Parfyonova was born on 21 June 1920 to a Russian peasant family in the Russian SFSR, the youngest of five children. She graduated from nursing courses before attending the local flight club and eventually became a flight instructor. Having become the first woman pilot in Alatyr, she trained a large number of young people before the war.  Military career  Parfyonova joined the Soviet military in 1941 shortly after the German invasion of the Soviet Union. In early 1942 she graduated from training at the Engels military aviation school and was sent to the Eastern front in May where she fought as part of the regiment in the Southern, Transcaucasus, North Caucasusian and 4th Ukrainian fronts. She became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1943. She bombed Germans over Kuban, the Taman peninsula, Sevastopol, Poland and Germany, reaching the vicinity of Berlin. She did not take part in the Belorussian offensive, because she was recovering from wounds. On 29 January 1945, when performing a supply drop of ammunition for Soviet ground troops, her Po-2 was attacked by a barrage of anti-aircraft fire and shelling, tearing through the fuselage with shrapnel entering the cockpit, seriously injuring her hip and causing major blood loss. Despite sustaining such injuries in poor visibility combined with heavy snowfall, significantly reduced maneuverability of the aircraft from the damage sustained, she still managed to land safely, losing consciousness soon afterwards. After the incident she received medical care and informed soldiers of the positions of the Axis anti-aircraft equipment. By February 1945 she flew 739 sorties, during which she dropped 104 tons of bombs, destroyed Axis ammunition warehouses, an infantry battalion, and equipment as well as dropping 500,000 leaflets and forcing five artillery batteries to retreat. For doing so she was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 16 February 1946, which was awarded on 18 August 1945; by the end of the war she had flown 815 missions. In Germany she met her future husband, pilot Mikhail Akimov.  Postwar life  After the end of the Second World War, Parfyonova left active duty and joined the reserve. She was a member of the Soviet Committee of War Veterans. She gave birth to two daughters and worked in the city of Ryazan as a cinema manager until 1979. She moved to Moscow in 1991. She died on 7 April 1993 and was buried in the Shcherbinsky Central Cemetery.

History Kanopolis Drive-in was opened by U.S. veteran Tony Blazina in 1952. Prior to its opening, Blazina had a mobile movie business, in which he and his wife, Olga, were hired by merchants in surrounding small towns to show movies for customers. From this experience, Tony designed a drive-in theater initially with a smaller screen. The current 60x30 feet screen was installed after the original was damaged in a wind storm. Following Tony's death in 1994, the family business was managed by Olga, and daughters, Liz Ray and Irene Pacey. The theater operated continuously until Olga's death in 2009, followed by Ray two months later. Pacey considered reopening after five years, but decided to sell the theater to Ellsworth County residents Josh and Amanda Webb. The Webb family invested in maintenance and modernization of the theater, including the installation of a new roof on the projector house, new FM audio transmitters for movie sound, and repainting of the movie screen.

The discipline of Tenrikyo theology consists of scriptural studies (studies of the Ofudesaki, Mikagura-uta, and Osashizu), historical theology, dogmatic theology, and practical theology.Tenri University Oyasato Institute for the Study of Religion ed., Kaitei Tenrikyo jiten, Tenriky≈ç D≈çy≈´sha, 1997, p.591‚Äì4. ScriptureGod=Names= Depiction of Nakayama Kokan spreading the divine name Tenri-O-no-Mikoto (Â§©ÁêÜÁéãÂëΩ) in Osaka. In historical documents and scriptures related to Tenrikyo, a number of different appellations are ascribed to God. In the Ofudesaki, God identified as three different entities. In 1869, when the first verses were composed, God initially identified as kami (Á•û), a spirit in the Japanese Shinto tradition. The designation kami was broader than the Abrahamic notion of God, as it could be applied to any object that possessed divine power or inspired awe, such as animals, trees, places, and people. However, the Ofudesaki stressed the uniqueness of the kami by adding various qualifiers such as moto no kami (God of origin), shinjitsu no kami (God of truth), and kono y≈ç o hajimeta kami (God who began this world). From 1874, God began to identify as tsukihi (ÊúàÊó•), or moon-sun, and from 1879, God began to identify as oya („Çí„ÇÑ), or parent, though kami and tsukihi continued to be used until the last part of the scripture. In Tenrikyo's creation story, outlined in the Ofudesaki and elaborated upon in various notes on her talks known collectively as k≈çki, there are ten figures credited with the creation of human beings. Some Tenrikyo authorities suggest that two of these figures, Kunitokotachi-no-Mikoto and Omotari-no-Mikoto, represent tsukihi, or more precisely the duality tsuki-sama and hi-sama. The other eight figures are tools subordinate to tsukihi that were drawn in, consulted, and trained in the creation of human beings. In the Mikagura-uta, the songs of Tenrikyo's liturgy, God is commonly referred to as kami. At the end of most of the songs, God is invoked with the name Tenri-≈å-no-Mikoto, („Å¶„Çì„Çä„Åä„ÅÜ„ÅÆ„Åø„Åì„Å® or Â§©ÁêÜÁéãÂëΩ) or \\"absolute ruler of divine reason.\\" The historical sources written during Nakayama Miki's lifetime and in the years following her death suggest a number of other appellations of God. In Nakayama Shinnosuke's Oyasama gyoden, the source on which The Life of Oyasama is primarily based, Miki refers to God as ten no sh≈çgun (Sh≈çgun of Heaven) in the initial revelation. In early attempts to obtain religious sanctions from the Yoshida Administrative Office of Shinto and a Shingon Buddhist temple, the name of God was recorded as Tenrin-≈å-My≈çjin (Â§©Ëº™ÁéãÊòéÁ•û) and Tenrin-≈å-K≈çsha (Ëª¢Ëº™ÁéãË¨õÁ§æ) respectively. An early doctrine of the Tenrikyo church, written to conform to the State Shinto doctrine at the time, records the name as Tenri-≈åkami. Tenrikyo's current doctrine maintains that Tenri-≈å-no-Mikoto is the divine name to be used in the context of prayer. The doctrine frequently refers to God as God the Parent (Ë¶™Á•ûÊßò oyagamisama), emphasizing the parental nature of God revealed toward the end of the Ofudesaki. The doctrine claims that the changes in God's names in the Ofudesaki, from kami to tsukihi to oya, were made in accordance with the spiritual growth of the early followers. =Attributes= The Ofudesaki verses name j≈´y≈ç or j≈´y≈çjizai, translated as \\"omnipotence\\" or \\"free and unlimited workings,\\" as a significant attribute of God. This omnipotence governs not only the order of the universe, but also events in the natural world, such as rainstorms and earthquakes, and in one's personal life, such as dreams and diseases. This omnipotence works through those people who believe as well as those who do not.Becker, p.12. OyasamaHuman nature=Causality=Comparison to karmic belief The concept of \\"causality\\" (innen „ÅÑ„Çì„Å≠„Çì) in Tenrikyo is a unique understanding of karmic belief. Though causality resembles karmic beliefs found in religious traditions originating in ancient India, such as Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, Tenrikyo's doctrine does not claim to inherit the concept from these traditions and differs from their explanations of karma in a few significant ways. Broadly speaking, karma refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).Karma Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2012) In other words, a person's good intent and good deed contribute to good karma and future happiness, while bad intent and bad deed contribute to bad karma and future suffering.Lawrence C. Becker & Charlotte B. Becker, Encyclopedia of Ethics, 2nd Edition, , Hindu Ethics, pp 678 Causality and karma are interchangeable in this sense;Kisala, Robert. \\"Contemporary Karma: Interpretations of Karma in Tenriky≈ç and Rissh≈ç K≈çseikai.\\" Japanese Journal of Religious Studies, Vol. 21, No. 1 (Mar., 1994), pp. 73-91: \\"In accord with traditional karmic understanding, it is the accumulation of bad innen that is offered as the explanation for present suffering.\\" throughout life a person may experience good and bad causality. In Tenrikyo, the concept is encapsulated in the farming metaphor, \\"every seed sown will sprout.\\"Fukaya, Yoshikazu. \\"Every Seed Sown Will Sprout.\\" Words of the Path. online link Karma is closely associated with the idea of rebirth,James Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Rosen Publishing, New York, , pp 351-352 such that one's past deeds in the current life and in all previous lives are reflected in the present moment, and one's present deeds are reflected in the future of the current life and in all future lives.\\"Karma\\" in: John Bowker (1997), The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions, Oxford University Press. This understanding of rebirth is upheld in causality as well.Kisala, p.77. \\"...traditional karmic beliefs in personal responsibility, extending over innumerable lifetimes, are upheld in doctrines concerning individual innen.\\" Tenrikyo's ontology, however, differs from older karmic religious traditions such as Buddhism. In Tenrikyo, the human person is believed to consist of mind, body, and soul. The mind, which is given the freedom to sense, feel, and act by God the Parent, ceases to function at death. On the other hand, the soul, through the process of denaoshi (Âá∫Áõ¥„Åó, \\"to make a fresh start\\"), takes on a new body lent from God the Parent and is reborn into this world. Though the reborn person has no memory of the previous life, the person's thoughts and deeds leave their mark on the soul and are carried over into the new life as the person's causality.Kisala, p.77. As can be seen, Tenrikyo's ontology, which rests on the existence on a single creator deity (God the Parent), differs from Buddhist ontology, which does not contain a creator deity. Also Tenrikyo's concept of salvation, which is to live the Joyous Life in this existence and therefore does not promise a liberated afterlife outside of this existence, differs from Buddhist concepts of sa·πÉsƒÅra and nirvana.Tenrikyo-Christian Dialogue, p. 429-430. Original causality At the focal point of Tenrikyo's ontological understanding is the positing of original causality, or causality of origin (moto no innen „ÇÇ„Å®„ÅÆ„ÅÑ„Çì„Å≠„Çì), which is that God the Parent created human beings to see them live the Joyous Life (the salvific state) and to share in that joy. Tenrikyo teaches that the Joyous Life will eventually encompass all humanity, and that gradual progress towards the Joyous Life is even now being made with the guidance of divine providence. Thus the concept of original causality has a teleological element, being the gradual unfolding of that which was ordained at the beginning of time.Kisala, p.77. Individual causality Belief in individual causality is related to the principle of original causality. Individual causality is divine providence acting to realize the original causality of the human race, which through the use of suffering guides individuals to realize their causality and leads them to a change of heart and active cooperation towards the establishment of the Joyous Life, the world that was ordained at the beginning of time.Kisala, p.77-8. Tenrikyo's doctrine explains that an individual's suffering should not be perceived as punishment or retributive justice from divine providence for past misdeeds, but rather as a sign of encouragement from divine providence for the individual to reflect on the past and to undergo a change of heart. The recognition of the divine providence at work should lead to an attitude of tanno („Åü„Çì„ÅÆ„ÅÜ \\"joyous acceptance\\" in Tenrikyo gloss), a Japanese word that indicates a state of satisfaction. Tanno is a way of settling the mind ‚Äì it is not to merely resign oneself to one's situation, but rather to actively ‚Äúrecognize God‚Äôs parental love in all events and be braced by their occurrence into an ever firmer determination to live joyously each day.‚ÄùDoctrine of Tenrikyo, Tenrikyo Church HQ, 61. In other words, Tenrikyo emphasizes the importance of maintaining a positive inner disposition, as opposed to a disposition easily swayed by external circumstance.Kisala, p.78. Three causalities In addition, The Doctrine of Tenrikyo names three causalities (san innen „Åï„Çì„ÅÑ„Çì„Å≠„Çì) that are believed to predetermine the founding of Tenrikyo's teachings. More precisely, these causalities are the fulfillment of the promise that God made to the models and instruments of creation, which was that \\"when the years equal to the number of their first born had elapsed, they would be returned to the Residence of Origin, the place of original conception, and would be adored by their posterity.\\"The Doctrine of Tenrikyo, p.20. The \\"Causality of the Soul of Oyasama\\" denotes that Miki Nakayama had the soul of the original mother at creation (Izanami-no-Mikoto), who conceived, gave birth to, and nurtured humankind. The \\"Causality of the Residence\\" means that the Nakayama Residence, where Tenrikyo Church Headquarters stands, is the place that humankind was conceived. The \\"Causality of the Promised Time\\" indicates that October 26, 1838 ‚Äì the day when God became openly revealed through Miki Nakayama ‚Äì marked the time when the years equal to the number of first-born humans (900,099,999) had elapsed since the moment humankind was conceived.A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms, p.436. Creation narrative The creation narrative of Tenrikyo, which followers refer to as the \\"Truth of Origin\\" (ÂÖÉ„ÅÆÁêÜ moto no ri), explains Nakayama Miki's understanding of how God created the first prototypes of human beings and developed them over many years. The creation narrative first appeared in writing in 1874, when Nakayama Miki composed Part III of the Ofudesaki. The narrative was described in more detail in Part VI and continued to be explained in fragments in the parts thereafter. However, Miki also conveyed the narrative as part of talks she would deliver to her disciples regarding her teachings. She had her disciples write down what they remembered of her talks and submit them to her for her approval. In the end she never approved any of the manuscripts, so her followers did not regard them as canonical in the same way as the scriptures ‚Äì namely the Ofudesaki, Mikagura- uta, and Osashizu. The manuscripts that have survived are collectively referred to as k≈çki („Åì„Åµ„Åç). In the latter half of the twentieth century, scholars began to publish interpretations of the creation narrative based on various disciplines such as ethnology, cosmology, philosophy, comparative mythology, psychology, and biology. Salvation=PrayersPractices=History A year after the death of Tenrikyo founder Nakayama Miki in 1887, Tenrikyo Church Headquarters was established as a legally recognized religious organization under the Shinto Main Bureau (Á•ûÈÅìÊú¨Â±Ä Shinto Honkyoku).Tenrikyo Overseas Mission Department. A Historical Sketch of Tenrikyo. Translation of Oyasama Nensai to Tomoni. Tenri, 1990. p.6. In 1900, Tenrikyo founded its first institute for doctrinal studies, Tenri Seminary. In 1903, an early edition of Tenrikyo's doctrine was completed, known today as the \\"Meiji doctrine\\" since it was written during the Meiji period. This edition of the doctrine differed significantly from the present editionFor instance, the Meiji kyoten contained ten chapters: 'Revering God,' 'Respecting the Emperor,' 'Loving the Nation,' 'Morality,' 'Accumulating Virtues,' 'Cleansing of Impurities,' 'Founding of the Teachings,' 'Repayment to God,' 'the Kagura', and 'Peace of Mind.' See Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness, p. 64 because the scholars who completed this edition were not strictly Tenrikyo scholars but scholars of religion (Nakanishi Ushir≈ç) and scholars of Shinto (Inoue Yorikuni, Itsumi Ch≈´zabur≈ç) invited from outside the Tenrikyo circle.Shimada, K. (2014). The Emergence and Development of Tenrikyo Theology. Tenri Journal of Religion, 42, 111. In 1925, Nakayama Shozen, Nakayama Miki's great-grandson, became the second Shinbashira (spiritual and administrative leader) of Tenrikyo Church Headquarters and founded the Department of Doctrine and Historical Materials. From 1925 to 1938, the Department of Doctrine and Historical Materials began to compile the sources which would form the basis of Tenrikyo's scriptures and supplements to the scriptures.Tenri Journal of Religion, 42, 112. During this period, several Tenrikyo students attended university and majored in religious studies. These would become some of Tenrikyo's first theologians. One such student was Nakayama Shozen, who from 1926‚Äì1929 studied the history of religion at Tokyo Imperial University under Masaharu Anesaki. In the following decade, others would major in religious studies at Tokyo Imperial University, such as Ueda Yoshinaru (1931), Nakayama Yoshikazu (1932), Nagao Hiroumi (1935), and Moroi Yoshinori (1938). Fukaya Tadamasa was studying Western history, with a focus on history of Christian theology, at Kyoto Imperial University.Tenri Journal of Religion, 42, 112‚Äì3. In the several years following World War II, further research and institutional development allowed for the emergence of Tenrikyo theology. In 1946, the Department of Doctrine and Historical Materials began to publish its findings in the periodical Fukugen ('Restoration'). The Doctrine of Tenrikyo, which systematically summarizes Tenrikyo's beliefs and practices, was published in 1949. In the same year, Tenri University was founded.Tenri Journal of Religion, 42, 116‚Äì7. Tenrikyo theology as a collective academic effort began with the first issue of Tenriky≈çgaku kenky≈´ (Studies on Tenrikyo theology) published in 1950. This issue opened with an essay by Moroi Yoshinori titled Tenriky≈ç shingaku josh≈ç (Introduction to Tenrikyo theology), which outlines what he believed to be the contents and the goals of Tenrikyo theology.Tenri Journal of Religion, 42, 107‚Äì110, 118. Modern Christian theology and existentialism have had a significant influence in the early development of Tenrikyo theology. Early Tenrikyo scholars expressed interest in the thought of S√∏ren Kierkegaard, Karl Jaspers, and Gabriel Marcel,van Straelen, 5. and recommended that their students study Karl Barth's Church Dogmatics.Tenri Journal of Religion, 42, 35.

He wrote a number of books which have since been translated into English by the Tenrikyo Overseas Department, such as a Mikagura-uta commentary (A Commentary on the Mikagura- uta) and a study on Tenrikyo's creation narrative (A Doctrinal Study: The Truth of Origin). =Other theologians= Tenrikyo theologians have focused on subfields of study within Tenrikyo theology. Scriptural studies is based on contributions of Nakayama Shozen, Moroi Yoshinori, and Fukaya Tadamasa, and more recent contributors to this subfield include Nakajima Hideo, Yamamoto Kunio, Serizawa Shigeru, and Sawai Yuichi. Research on Tenrikyo's relationship to contemporary thought has been done by Iida Teruaki. Research on Tenrikyo missiology has been conducted by Shionoya Satoshi. Historical research on Tenrikyo has been contributed by Ishizaki Masao and Ihashi Fusato.

Mosbolletjies were typically made during the wine making season when its key ingredient was readily available.  Composition  Traditionally grape must left over from the production of wine was used to as a leavening agent and added to dough. Spices such as aniseed are added and the mixed dough is then baked. In modern times grape juice and yeast are typically used instead of grape must. The dough of the buns are rolled into balls and packed tightly into a backing tray giving it a consistent series of bumps that once baked make individual pieces easy to pull off.

The name refers to the counties it passed through, today amalgamated as Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry. The line was chartered in 1912 to provide CP service to Cornwall, which was previously served by the Grand Trunk Railway and New York and Ottawa Railway. The line opened in May 1915, and only days later was leased to CP for 99 years. It operated as their Cornwall Subdivision until being abandoned in 1995. , the right of way remains in good condition, with small portions being used for a variety of recreational uses. History=Previous attempts= Cornwall had long been connected to the Grand Trunk Railway's (GTR) Toronto- Montreal mainline, which ran along the northern section of the downtown area. However, a connection to other lines was desired, both to access additional routes, especially westward, as well as to provide competition for the GTR. In 1881, Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) interests chartered the Ontario and Quebec Railway to build a line from Toronto to Smiths Falls in eastern Ontario, some distance southwest of Ottawa. Smiths Falls would offer a connection with the Brockville and Ottawa Railway (B&O;), which rechartered as the Canada Central Railway (CCR) in 1881 to build an extension to Ottawa. In 1882, the Cornwall Junction Railway was chartered to build a line from Cornwall to meet the CCR at Smiths Falls, and then press on to Perth or Carleton Place. CP's plans expanded, and additional routes were added to the growing Q&O; network. This included purchasing the Atlantic and North-West Railway (A&N;) in Quebec from its US owners, and planning for a connecting line between Smiths Falls and the A&N; at Montreal. These links made the original Cornwall Junction plans superfluous. The Cornwall Junction Railway rechartered on 2 September 1886 with plans to run northeast out of Cornwall to meet the O&Q; at its closest point, about north of the city. The O&Q; extension to Montreal was completed in 1888, but the Cornwall line was never built. Competition arrived on 23 June 1887, when the Prescott County Railway was chartered to build three lines in the eastern Ontario area based on the Canadian Atlantic Railway's (CAR) mainline running from Ottawa to Montreal, only a short distance north of the O&Q.; The first would connect to the CAR at Glen Robertson and run north to Hawkesbury on the Ottawa River, a second would run southwest from Glen Robertson to Cornwall, and the third was a completely separate line just east of Ottawa running from Limoges to Rockland. The company was renamed the Central Counties Railway in April 1880, and leased to the CAR on 17 April 1891. For reasons that are not well recorded, the CCR abandoned plans for their Cornwall connection in 1898. Next up was the Cornwall and Hawkesbury Railway chartered in 1910 to build almost due north from Cornwall through Martintown and Alexandria to Hawkesbury, and then crossing the Ottawa River to connect to Canadian Pacific's line running along the north shore, meeting it somewhere between Calumet and Grenville in Quebec. This would run parallel to the CCR's Hawkesbury line, a short distance to the west. Nothing came of this initial proposal, and a second attempt to recharter the company in 1914 also led nowhere. =Construction= The Glengarry and Stormont Railway chartered in May 1912, with their own plans to connect to the O&Q.; The original plan was to run almost due north out of Cornwall to the O&Q; somewhere near Apple Hill, while a branch line would wye off at Martintown and run eastward for Williamstown and Lancaster. The original alignment was short lived. On 8 May 1913 the company rechartered with a new alignment running eastward through Williamstown to meet the O&Q; further east at a point that became known as Saint-Polycarpe Junction, just west of the small (ghost) town of De Beaujeu. Minor re-alignments followed over the next year before the settling on the final route. This last incarnation of the Glengarry and Stormont was finally successful in attracting investment. Track laying was completed on 30 November 1914, leaving only the stations and grading to be completed. The line's completion ceremony was marked by a dinner in Williamstown on 2 December. The first inspection train ran the line into Cornwall on 30 March. The first through train ran from Montreal on 2 April, and the line officially opened on 24 May 1915. On 1 June it was leased to the CPR for 99 years. As part of widespread changes to the railway operating rules, the G&SR; officially became part of the CPR and operated as their Cornwall Subdivision. The Cornwall Street Railway built interchanges at their yards in Cornwall, offering businesses the ability to use the tram network to ship goods to the G&SR.; In order to reduce the amount of traffic being carried on the lines on city streets, a new interchange line was built in 1949, which was itself replaced in 1953 by a new switching yard on the north edge of town, just south of the GTR (by this time Canadian National Railway) lines. =Abandonment= On 27 April 1952 CP received permission to abandon passenger service on the Cornwall Sub. The last passenger train left town on 20 September. This made the passenger station redundant and the short bit of line between Pitt and Sydney streets was abandoned on 31 January 1969. CP purchased the Cornwall Street Railway on 24 October 1969 in order to use their lines as spurs, but abandoned these plans and sold the lines to CN on 14 October 1970. CP abandoned the entire Cornwall Sub on 25 December 1995. Their short-lived subsidiary, the St. Lawrence and Hudson Railway, lifted the rails in 1998. The company was formally dissolved on 30 September 2004. Route :From the Ontario Railway Map Collection unless otherwise noted. The line's main station in Cornwall was located on the corner of Pitt Street and Sixth Street West, running east between Pitt and Sydney. A freight shed was located a block east at Amelia, within a larger L-shaped block of land forming the main railway operating area. Within the roughly rectangular area between Amelia and Adolphus, Sixth and Eight, were the turntable, engine house, water tower and ash pit. The line exited the rail yard heading northeast for a distance before it curved to the east-northeast at a point just outside town, just south of today's Ontario Highway 401. From there the line runs very straight, passing just north of Williamstown, bending slightly eastward to pass through Glen Gordon, and then east-northeast again for the remainder of the run to Saint-Polycarpe Junction, passing just outside Saint-T√©lesphore along the way. , the original station grounds between Pitt and Sydney is the parking lot for a Giant Tiger dollar store. The original switchyards are now mostly vacant, except for a Cornwall Electric building at 7th and Adolphus. A short section between the north end of the yard at Eighth Street and Marlborough, about two blocks, has been developed as a bike path. Between Marlborough and McConnell Avenue the line forms the back of a parking lot for a plaza. The city owns the line as far east as Boundary Road, about east, but it is currently undeveloped. Between Boundary Road and Country Road 19, near Williamstown, the line is used for private snowmobile and ATV use. From Williamstown to Bridge End some portions have been destroyed by local farmers who took over the land. The remaining from Bridge End to the O&Q; at St. Polycarpe Junction are currently unused but in good condition.

By great luck she gets a dance with college football star Roy Duncan (Gallery), although Roy has eyes for the village belle Prue Nickerson (La Plante). Phil Larrabee (Hughes), another suitor for Prue's hand, tells Roy that Prue's name is Idalene Nobbin, and Roy sends an invitation to attend a \\"prom\\" dance. Idalene and her mother appear at the dance, and Roy bribes his fellow students to fill Idalene's dance card. She overhears part of the bargaining and, hurt and humiliated, she rushes from the dance and stumbles in front of a passing automobile. With both legs broken, she is picked up by Pamela Shiel (Astor) and westerner Walt Breen (Dix). She confesses that she tried to kill herself, saying that she will never have a lover, a husband, home, or babies. Breen and Pamela decide to bring some sunshine into her life. After Idalene recovers, Pamela coaches her and dresses her in some gowns, and then gives a house party.

Thorbecke Lieutenant admiral Engelbertus Lucas (30 May 1785 in Schiedam ‚Äì 12 May 1870 in The Hague) was a Dutch naval officer of the Batavian Navy, the royal navy of the Kingdom of Holland, the navy of the First French Empire, and the Royal Dutch Navy, rising to the highest rank in the latter navy, and becoming Minister for the Navy in the first Cabinet of the Dutch Prime minister Johan Rudolph Thorbecke in 1849-1851. Personal life Lucas was born the son of future rear-admiral Engelbertus Lucas of the Batavian Navy and Catharina Prins, later a business woman who was a distiller of Jenever in his birthplace Schiedam, on 30 May 1785. He married Louisa Elisabeth Lamaison. Career Lucas entered the new cadet corps of the Batavian navy in 1795. He was promoted to cadet-first class in 1801. In 1802 he was commissioned as a naval lieutenant (junior grade). In 1808 he was promoted to naval lieutenant in the royal navy of the Kingdom of Holland, which he remained after the annexation of the Netherlands by the French Empire (being integrated in the French navy), until the country regained its independence in 1813. In 1814 he was promoted to commander in the Royal Dutch Navy. His promotion to kapitein ter zee followed in 1826. He was made a rear-admiral in 1837, and a vice-admiral in 1844. He retained that rank during his stint as Minister for the Navy from 1849 to 1851. On 21 April 1851 (after his resignation from the government) he resigned his commission for reasons of age, but on 1 June 1865 he was promoted to lieutenant-admiral (ret.), the highest rank in the Royal Dutch navy.Parlement & Politiek, passim His functions as a naval officer included commander of the ship-of-the-line Zr.Ms. De Zeeuw in 1827, and commander of troop transports in the Scheldt (the Bath squadron) during the conflict with Belgium in 1833. He lost the frigate Zr. Ms. Sumatra due to an accident on the Scheldtvan Royen, p. 241. From 1 August 1838 to 1 March 1842 he was Commander of the Dutch navy in the Dutch East Indies, and at the same time Inspector of the Colonial navy (the predecessor of the Gouvernementsmarine). From 1 October 1843 to 1 November 1849 he was Director of the Directorate of the Navy at Vlissingen. At the insistence of king William III of the Netherlands he was included as Minister for the Navy in the first Cabinet of Prime Minister Thorbecke (though that statesman would have preferred his political ally Isa√§c Theodorus ter Bruggen Hugenholtz) on 1 November 1849. Lucas proposed a renovation of the lock at Willemstad in the 1851 budget. This was approved by the Tweede Kamer of the States General of the Netherlands, though with only a ten-vote majority (32-22). Being a short-tempered man, Lucas took umbrage and resigned from the office. The proposal was later defeated 8-25 in the Eerste Kamervan Royen, p. 241. After his retirement Lucas remained a courtier at the Dutch court. He was appointed Aide de Camp of the king in extraordinary service on 24 April 1850. He was also appointed Chancellor of the Military Order of William (he had himself been knighted in that order in 1842), and the Order of the Netherlands Lion (of which he was made a Commander in 1846, and promoted to Grand Cross in 1849).

She specialises in the history of migration and diaspora. She is also a citizens' rights campaigner and founder of the EU Citizens' Champion campaign.  Education  Bueltmann studied British Cultural Studies, History and Sociology at Bielefeld University, also spending a year at the University of Edinburgh as an ERASMUS study abroad student, receiving an MA in 2005. Participation in the ERASMUS study abroad programme \\"laid the roots for her subsequent research and career\\". She was a PhD candidate with the Irish-Scottish studies programme at the Victoria University of Wellington, with her PhD research funded by the New Zealand government's New Zealand International Doctoral Research Scholarship scheme. While she was a PhD student, Bueltmann published several papers and appeared in national media.  Career  Bueltmann's research interests are in diaspora history, particularly in connection to Scottish and English immigrant communities. In 2011, Bueltmann published her thesis \\"Scottish Ethnicity and the Making of New Zealand Society, 1850-1930\\", in which she \\"sets the scene for Scottish migration to New Zealand\\". In 2012 she focused on English communities overseas, co-editing a collection entitled Locating the English the English Diaspora, 1500-2010. She continued to research the movement of Scots overseas, and, in 2015, co-edited The Scottish Diaspora together with Professor Graeme Morton and Dr Andrew Hinson. Later that year she published Clubbing Together: Ethnicity, Civility and Formal Sociability in the Scottish Diaspora to 1930, investigating Scottish ethnicity and associational activism. The book is the 2015 winner of the Saltire Society Scottish Research Book of the Year award. In 2017 Bueltmann published the co-authored monograph The English Diaspora in North America: Migration, Ethnicity and Association, 1730s-1950s, the output of an AHRC funded grant. Bueltmann argues that amid the uproar about migrant populations trying to seek refuge within the UK, it is easy to forget the historic outward migration of Britons. More recently, she has also examined the collective action being taken by EU citizens in the UK in response to Brexit. Bueltmann is a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society (FRHistS) and Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA). Bueltmann worked at Northumbria University from February 2009 until July 2020, when she took up a Chair in International History at the University of Strathclyde.  The UK's EU referendum and Brexit  Bueltmann is vocal in her support for Britain remaining in the European Union. As her research is focused on migration history, and she is a German living in the UK, her concern about Brexit is both professional and personal. She was a member of the lobbying group \\"Historians for Britain in Europe\\" and describes herself as an EU citizen. Before the referendum, Bueltmann voiced concerns that the \\"tolerant UK I love seems to be vanishing\\". After becoming a public figure for the Remain movement, she received abusive messages. She was not surprised by the outcome of the EU referendum, but, as many others, has been troubled by the events since. In March 2017 she attended Newcastle's pro-EU rally, and, when interviewed by the BBC, said she had moved from Germany to \\"contribute to life and society in the UK and I think I've been doing that every single day since I arrived eight years ago\\". She was a guest speaker at the People's March for Europe in London in September 2017. Since Britain's vote to leave the EU, she has written articles for a number of newspapers and online platforms, including the Guardian, HuffPost UK, and Metro. Bueltmann has publicly spoken out against the government's Brexit reassurances. She remains concerned about the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and Britons who live in the EU, and continues to take a vocal stand against their being used as bargaining chips in negotiations. When the government made a plea for EU academics to remain in the UK, Bueltmann told the Independent newspaper \\"if they really meant they want us to stay, they would have guaranteed our rights fully on 24 June 2016\\". She later argued in the Times Higher Education, in a rebuttal to the then Immigration Minister Brandon Lewis's article addressed to EU nationals working in Higher Education, that what everyone failed to see was that the UK is not the destination for EU nationals, but their home. Since the EU referendum Bueltmann has focused primarily on the situation of the more than three million EU citizens at home in the UK and fighting for the protection of their rights. She is working with other campaigners, politicians and policy organisations, including the German Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung. In July 2018, Bueltmann founded the EU Citizens' Champion campaign to facilitate that work. The campaign serves two purposes: to support the3million, the UK‚Äôs leading not for profit organisation working to protect EU citizens‚Äô rights, with a fundraiser, and to facilitate engagement activities that help change the narrative about freedom of movement and migration. The campaign launch video - a satire on settled status - features actor and director David Schneider.

He founded Leominster Orphan Homes, was active in the Religious Society of Friends, and edited The Friend publication for 20 years.  Early Life  Henry Stanley Newman was the first child and only son of Josiah Newman, grocer, and Harriett Wood, daughter of a Liverpool tea dealer. Born in Liverpool, he moved to Deptford and then New Cross in London, as his parents' business failed, and then to Cirencester in 1842, where they began to prosper. Newman attended Bootham School, York 1848-1852 where he became friends with boys from other notable Quaker families. Harriett died in 1851 shortly after giving birth to her fourth daughter. Josiah moved the family to Leominster in 1852 to take over the running of his father's grocery business, Newman and Son, in the same year that Newman was apprenticed to the Quaker firm of Isaac Gray Bass in Brighton. Despite a growing interest in public education, he returned to the family business in Leominster in 1858 and continued to live in the Herefordshire market town until his death in 1912.Harriet M Newman. Henry Stanley Newman. FFMA 1917.  Family  Newman married Mary Anna, the sister of his friend Stanley Pumphrey of Worcester, in 1863, adopting the second name Stanley to honour his brother-in-law and to distinguish himself from his uncle Henry Newman. They lived above the shop in Broad Street, Leominster, and there raised a family of six children, two of whom died of consumption in their late teens. The house became a hub for Quaker activities in the town, for visiting Friends and those in difficulty, and their storeroom became first a schoolroom, then a printshop. Their children took part in all their philanthropic activities. Like his uncle Edward Newman, Henry Stanley shared the Newman family interest in natural history and enjoyed Sunday afternoon country walks and tending his fernery. When their oldest son Josiah married and took over the grocery business in 1891, Newman, his wife, and youngest daughter Caroline moved to Buckfield, Leominster, the house his father had built on the outskirts of Leominster. Josiah was the only one of his four surviving children to have a child, Elsie Winifred, who married but died childless. His oldest daughter Harriet became superintendent of the Greenwood Industrial School, Halstead.Halstead Industrial School for Girls. Peter Higginbotham. Children's Society His second son George Newman trained as a doctor, becoming the first Chief Medical Officer to the Ministry of Health.  Career and Achievements  Newman became a key figure in the local Quaker Meeting, travelling and preaching throughout Herefordshire, Radnorshire and beyond, and attracting new members and attendees to the Society of Friends. Membership doubled in the decade 1872-82.Minutes of Herefordshire and Radnorshire Monthly Meeting. 16 January 1882. Hereford Archive and Record Centre The Newmans were also responsible for establishing and sustaining a series of linked philanthropic enterprises aimed at improving social conditions, education and well-being in Leominster. They were practical philanthropists, taking immediate action when they saw the need, and trusting to the generosity of Friends and well-wishers to keep things going. In 1858 he began teaching the adult school that his father and uncle established in a storeroom behind the shop, later moving it to larger premises as membership grew to over 200. A year later he formed the Leominster Tract Association to publish short, simple stories on religious and moral themes to appeal to working people. Leominster Orphan Homes He opened the Leominster Orphan Homes in rented premises in 1869, then in 1872 raised the capital to build a pair of new homes with a garden and orchard to accommodate forty children in a healthy and caring environment. After a visit to Germany to study industrial training schemes in 1872, he set up the Orphans' Printing Press, again in the storeroom, specifically to provide training and enhance the employment prospects of boys in the Orphan Homes, and also as a sustainable income to help fund the Homes. The Press printed hundreds of thousands of leaflets for the Tract Association, teaching materials and books for adult schools and the profits went to support the Orphan Homes.The Story of the Orphan Homes Leominster. Orphans' Printing Press. 1880 Although Henry Stanley Newman continued to be involved personally in the management and operation of the Orphan Homes and Orphans' Press until his death, a Trust Deed was completed and enrolled in Chancery in 1874, Trustees appointed and the deeds of the properties passed to it. The Trustees were all eminent Quakers linked to the Newmans by birth or marriage and included George Cadbury, Thomas Barrow and Theodore Neild.Orphan Homes Annual Report 1874. He was made a County Magistrate in 1893, the same year his son Josiah left Leominster and Newman bought back the grocery business and relaunched it as Newman and Co with fellow Quaker Hubert Reynolds. The business was sold to Reynolds after Newman's death in 1912.Trade advertisements in Leominster News 1893 & 1912 Newman also played an increasingly significant role in the Quakers nationally, one of a younger generation of more outward looking and evangelical Quakers.Thomas C Kennedy.

In 1891 Newman became editor of The Friend when it changed from being monthly to weekly, and moved printing to the Orphans' Press. Not only did he teach the men's class at Leominster Adult School for 50 years, he also addressed national conferences on adult education, organised university extension lectures in Leominster, wrote and published many books and pamphlets on education, mission work and Quaker beliefs.Henry Stanley Newman at Leominster.

Whilst playing in the Brisbane Rugby League Premiership as the Norths side's , Geiger had just served a three-match ban for a late tackle when he was selected to represent Queensland in the first match of 1977's interstate series against New South Wales due to the absence of Test hooker John Lang with a knee injury. He went on to play in the second and final match of that year's series as well. Later that year Geiger also gained selection in Australia's 1977 World Cup team. The selectors had originally chosen the Blues' George Peponis and omitted Queensland captain Arthur Beetson, but when Australian Rugby Football League president Kevin Humphreys refused to ratify the side, Beetson was reinstated, with the Queensland selectors putting in Geiger at the expense of Peponis. Geiger played the first of his four matches in total for Australia, making him Kangaroo No. 496. His last match for the Kangaroos was the closely contested 1977 Rugby League World Cup Final against Great Britain, in which he played hooker and helped Australia to a one-point victory. Geiger made some appearances for the Penrith Panthers in the 1979 NSWRFL season's Premiership, but after being replaced by local junior Steve Martin, he returned to Brisbane.

Brody received his BSc in physics at Niigata University and earned an MSc and PhD degrees in theoretical physics from Imperial. Brody held a PPARC (Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council) research fellowship in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics in Cambridge University, in conjunction with a Research Fellowship at Churchill College. In 1999 he returned to Imperial College as a Royal Society University Research Fellow. In 2004 Brody was invited to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo as an Outstanding Young Person to meet the Emperor of Japan. Brody has been a full professor since 2011 and, as of 2018, Brody holds a chair in Mathematics at the University of Surrey in the UK. Brody's research covers a broad range of topics in applied mathematics. During the early part of his career he focused on statistical mechanics, which led naturally to stochastic processes and financial mathematics in one direction and to thermodynamics and quantum mechanics in another. Brody's work has covered information geometry and geometric quantum theory as well as foundational issues in quantum theory, quantum statistical mechanics and quantum cosmology in theoretical physics; and using concepts of information geometry, nonlinear filtering and information asymmetry in financial mathematics. He is on the editorial boards of Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical, International Journal of Theoretical and Applied Finance and Information Geometry. Brody has published more than 100 papers with his most recognisable contributions being in the complex extension of quantum mechanics known as PT-symmetric quantum mechanics, and in the introduction of information-based asset pricing theory.

Camacho was born in 1926 in Meng√≠bar, Province of Ja√©n. Camacho, and his Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), came to power in Granada due to an agreement between the PSOE, the Partido Socialista de Andaluc√≠a (PSA), and the Conservative Party (PC) following the 1979 Spanish local elections. Under the terms of the agreement, the three parties divided control of the eight Andalusian provincial capital cities. PSOE and PSA decided to exchange control of two of Andalusicia's largest cities: Granada and Sevilla. The PSOE, under Camacho, was granted control of Granada, even though the opposition Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD) had won the most votes in Granada's municipal election. In exchange for Granada, the Partido Socialista de Andaluc√≠a (PSA) (now known as the Andalusian Party) was given control of Sevilla's city government. Antonio Camacho Garc√≠a took office as Granada's new mayor on April 19, 1979, becoming the city's first mayor following the 1979 democratic elections. However, his tenure as mayor lasted only six months due to infighting within the PSOE. He stepped down as mayor in October 1979, citing personal reasons. He was succeeded by PSOE member, .

Arkansas, 566 U.S. 599 (2012), was a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States that clarified the limits of the Double Jeopardy Clause. The Supreme Court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar retrial of counts that a jury had previously unanimously voted to acquit on, when a mistrial is declared after the jury deadlocked on a lesser included offense. Alex Blueford was tried on capital murder and three lesser included offenses: first-degree murder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide. After deliberating, the jury reported that it had unanimously voted to acquit on the charges of capital murder and first-degree murder, but had deadlocked on manslaughter and had not voted on negligent homicide. The trial court declared a mistrial and denied a motion to dismiss the charges of capital murder and first-degree murder on double jeopardy grounds. The Supreme Court of Arkansas affirmed the denial of the motion on interlocutory appeal. The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Supreme Court of Arkansas. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Roberts held that because the jury did not formally acquit on any charges, the report of the foreperson that the jury had unanimously voted against capital murder and first-degree murder \\"lacked the finality\\" required to prevent a retrial. Further, Chief Justice Roberts found that the trial court's declaration of a mistrial was proper under the circumstances. Dissenting, Justice Sotomayor wrote that the state should not be able to retry Blueford on capital and first-degree murder because the jury had announced its unanimous vote against capital and first-degree murder in open court. Background=Double Jeopardy Clause= The Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution generally prohibits criminally prosecuting a defendant twice for the same offense, mandating that: The Supreme Court has delineated a number of exceptions to this general prohibition. In particular, retrial after a mistrial is governed by the \\"manifest necessity\\" rule first outlined by the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Perez, which held that a retrial is not prohibited by the Double Jeopardy Clause after a mistrial where there is a \\"manifest necessity\\" in declaring a mistrialparticularly, following a hung jury. =Trial= Alex Blueford was tried in August 2009 on charges of capital murder and the lesser included offenses of first-degree murder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide arising from the death of his girlfriend's one-year-old son in November 2007. The trial judge instructed the jury to consider the lesser included offenses of first-degree murder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide only if the jury unanimously voted to acquit Blueford of the more serious charge of capital murder.Blueford v. Arkansas, , 132 S. Ct. 2044, 2054 (2012) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). In the United States, juries must unanimously vote to give a verdict, whether to convict or to acquit. After deliberations, the jury foreperson informed the trial court that the jury was deadlocked. The trial judge and foreperson then engaged in the following colloquy: The trial judge noted to the attorneys that the jurors \\"haven't even taken a vote on [negligent homicide].... I don't think they've completed their deliberation.... I mean, under any reasonable circumstances, they would at least take a vote on negligent homicide.\\"Blueford v. Arkansas, , 132 S. Ct. 2044, 2059 (2012) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). The trial judge then ordered the jury to continue deliberations. After further deliberation, the jury reported that it had still not come to a verdict, and the trial court declared a mistrial. The prosecution then decided to retry Blueford on all four original counts, and the trial judge denied Blueford's motion to dismiss the charges of capital murder and first-degree murder on double jeopardy grounds. =Supreme Court of Arkansas= Upon interlocutory appeal, the Supreme Court of Arkansas affirmed the denial of the motion to dismiss. The Supreme Court of Arkansas wrote that the jury foreperson's announcement that the jury had unanimously voted to acquit Blueford of capital murder and first-degree murder was not final and did not constitute a formal verdict. The Supreme Court of Arkansas further held that the trial court was not required to obtain a \\"partial verdict\\" on the capital murder and first-degree murder charges, and that the declaration of a mistrial on all charges was proper even though the jury had unanimously agreed to acquit on capital murder and first-degree murder charges. Accordingly, the Supreme Court of Arkansas held that the Double Jeopardy Clause did not prohibit Blueford's retrial.Blueford v. State, 2011 Ark. 8, 370 S.W.3d 496 (2011). Supreme Court Blueford sought review before the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted certiorari.Blueford v. Arkansas, 565 U.S. ___, 132 S.Ct. 397 (2011). =Arguments= Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel arguing the state's case before the United States Supreme Court. Before the Supreme Court, Blueford argued that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits a retrial on charges of capital murder and first-degree murder because the foreperson's report that the jury had unanimously voted against those charges acquitted him of those charges. Blueford asserted that even though the jury had not filled out a formal form verdict, the foreperson's clear announcement in open court that the jury had unanimously voted to acquit Blueford of charges constituted a final verdict of acquittal. Additionally, Blueford argued that because the trial court had instructed the jury to consider the lesser included charges only if the jury had unanimously voted to acquit on the more serious charge, the jury's deadlock on manslaughter established that it had acquitted Blueford on capital murder and first-degree murder. Blueford also contended that because a conviction of a lesser included offense implicitly acquits on a more serious offense,Price v. Georgia, a deadlock on a lesser included offense must also implicitly acquit on a more serious offense. The prosecution replied that the jury never entered a final verdict which would foreclose further prosecution under the Double Jeopardy Clause. The prosecution noted that the foreperson's report was not final, and that the jury continued to deliberate after the foreperson announced the votes, and argued that because the trial judge did not engage in the typical \\"polling\\" of jurors to ensure the foreperson's report was truly unanimous, the report could not constitute a final verdict. The prosecution also contended that the trial judge's instructions that the jury unanimously vote that there was a reasonable doubt on one charge before discussing a lesser included charge did not require the jury to \\"acquit\\" Blueford because jurors could change their minds. Various groups submitted arguments as amici curiae. The State of Michigan, joined by 22 states, submitted a brief in support of the prosecution arguing that requiring states to accept partial verdicts would overly coerce jurors. Conversely, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers submitted a brief in support of Blueford asserting that partial verdicts should be required because the importance of double jeopardy protection outweighs any potential coercive effects on jurors. =Opinion of the Court= Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the 6‚Äì3 majority. In May 2012, the Supreme Court issued a decision affirming the Supreme Court of Arkansas by 6‚Äì3 vote. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Roberts held that the foreperson's announcement to the trial court that the jury had unanimously voted to acquit on the charges of capital murder and first-degree murder did not constitute a verdict of acquittal because the jury resumed deliberating after the announcement: The Court further held that the Constitution does not require states to accept \\"partial verdicts\\" before declaring a mistrial in order to retry a defendant in accordance with the Double Jeopardy Clause. The Court noted: The Court accordingly found that there was no double jeopardy bar on retrial. =Dissent= Justice Sotomayor wrote the dissent, joined by two others. Justice Sotomayor wrote a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kagan. Justice Sotomayor wrote that the foreperson's announcement that the jury had unanimously voted against conviction on capital and first-degree murder constituted an acquittal under governing law: Justice Sotomayor further wrote that states should allow juries to return partial verdicts before declaring mistrials because of hung juries: Reception Following the Supreme Court's decision, legal analyst Andrew Cohen, writing in The Atlantic, criticized the case as excessively narrowing the protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause, writing that \\"[t]he fact that it was theoretically possible that the jury could have changed its mind on the Blueford acquittals (during those 31 minutes of additional deliberations) was enough for Roberts and company to reward prosecutors with a second chance to convict Blueford of capital murder.\\" Law review articles also criticized the decision as overly harsh: Warren M. Klinger of the University of Pennsylvania Law Review argued that the Supreme Court's decision was \\"too rigid\\", Jalem Peguero of the California Law Review critiqued the decision as \\"formality over substance\\", and James Sheppard of the Mississippi Law Journal argued that in light of the decision, \\"acquit first\\" states like Arkansas should act to give greater protection to criminal defendants. Further trial In June 2013, Blueford made no-contest plea to the first degree murder before a judge in the Pulaski County, Arkansas. In exchange for the plea, prosecutors dropped the charge of capital murder and offered a 10-year prison sentence. Blueford was denied parole in December 2014 due to nature and seriousness of the crime and age of the victim, but was granted parole in December 2016. Blueford was shot dead in September 2019.

Design and development During the 1980s the Philippine Air Force (PAF) attempted to reduce its dependence upon American second-hand aircraft by starting its own indigenous aircraft programs. The first program was a single-engine trainer plane, designated the PADC Defiant 300, that could also be armed and used in the counter-insurgency role. The second was a Philippine-made light utility helicopter named the \\"Hummingbird\\". The two aircraft programs were supported by members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, but were not allowed to proceed by the government until July 1997, when President Fidel Ramos authorized spending for the project. The Philippine Aerospace Development Corporation (PADC) undertook the development effort. Ramos was succeeded shortly thereafter by President Joseph Estrada, whose government immediately conducted a review of the Defiant and Hummingbird programs. The review concluded that the two projects, which were only a year old at that point, were likely to be unjustifiably lengthy and expensive. As a result, both were immediately terminated. Another factor was that the Hummingbird was in fact essentially an unlicensed copy of the MBB/Eurocopter Bo 105C and Eurocopter had threatened to sue the Philippine government. PADC had been involved with the assembly and maintenance on the helicopters, first acquired during the 1970s. To avoid the impending legal battle, the PAF cancelled the program. As of 2012, no attempt had been made to revive the Defiant or develop another helicopter program. Variants ;X-100A:One prototype converted from an MBB/Eurocopter Bo 105C.

Approximately 55% of the Research Area by land extent is located on the largest of the islands, Beaver Island, and almost 20% on the second largest island, Garden Island. The remaining one-quarter of the Research Area is distributed among the largest four remaining islands of northern Lake Michigan. The Research Area cooperates with a federal unit, the Michigan Islands National Wildlife Refuge, which controls a separate set of four much smaller islands within the same archipelago.

The coup attempt failed and Tanai was forced to flee to Pakistan. Background Tanai, who has been described as a \\"radical nationalist\\" and fiercely anti-mujahideen, launched an unlikely alliance with hardline Islamic fundamentalist rebel Gulbuddin Hekmatyar of the Hizb-i Islami Gulbuddin party. Tanai was also against Najibullah's peace plans and supported a military solution to the conflict. Hekmatyar ordered his fighters to intensify their attacks against the Kabul regime in support of Tanai. The success of the coup was taken for granted. A previous coup attempt by Khalqists was foiled in December 1989, to which Tanai has been linked to. The coup occurred a year following the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. Tanai was apparently also supported by those important Khalqists who remained in the Politburo, Assadullah Sarwari and Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoy, respectively their country's envoys to Aden and Moscow. They were said to have been intimately connected with the coup and with Tanai. Sarwari, an old comrade of Tanai, was the chief of the Afghan intelligence (KHAD) under Nur Mohammad Taraki. He was a Khalqist hardliner known as the assassin of a rival Parcham faction member. Gulabzoy was minister of interior before being exiled on a diplomatic assignment to Moscow.The Afghanistan Wars: Second Edition by William Maley Tanai stated that he didn't disagree with President Najibullah's views, but rather with his policy on the military. :Najibullah was transferring all the privileges of the Army to the tribal militias and in particular to his special guard. I was against this because the Afghan Army was losing efficiency. The Pakistan government's involvement in this abortive affair was transparently obvious. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's plea to the other six party leaders to aid Tanai and Hekmatyar was rebuked as a disgrace to the jihad. Most of the factions viewed General Tanai as an opportunistic war criminal and hardline communist who was responsible for carpet-bombings in portions of the major western city of Herat in March 1979. Coup attempt Tanai ordered air strikes against government buildings. Jets flown by pilots loyal to Tanai flew in Kabul to bomb the targets, but most were repelled by the Army. Air Force Commander Abdul Qadir Aqa was an accomplice. Three rockets landed near the Presidential Palace. However the expected uprising by the Afghan Army didn't take place: Tanai had no direct control of troops inside Kabul. Tanai had sent the 15th Tank Brigade into the city to attack the Palace. Interior Minister Mohammad Aslam Watanjar played a major role in halting the coup plotters. He ordered a battalion to intercept the tanks and told his forces to capture Tanai \\"dead or alive\\". There was street fighting near the palace as well. President Najibullah appeared on television at 10 p.m. the same night to prove that he was physically there and in effective control of the state apparatus. The President gathered the support of important Parchamite militias, including the elite Special Guard to defuse the plot. Najibullah later claimed that the Soviet Union offered help to defect the coup, to which he thanked the offer and replied: \\"There's no need now. But if we face a foreign attack that will be another matter\\", referring to Pakistan. Aftermath In the afternoon of March 7, Tanai escaped to Bagram Air Base and fled by helicopter to Peshawar, Pakistan where he was greeted and publicly accepted as an ally by Hekmatyar. Eventually, he settled there in Pakistan, where he lived in exile until August 4. A general and two commanders loyal to Tanai were killed during the coup attempt. Najibullah grew even more suspicious of Khalqists, and thus another purge occurred, further deepening the rift between the two factions.http://uhami.com/8992civilwar_afghanistan30259.htm In all, 127 Khalqist military officers were arrested for the attempted coup, including Sarwari and Gulabzoy. Twenty-seven officers escaped and later showed up at a press conference with Hekmatyar in Peshawar. Former Minister of Tribal Affairs, Bacha Gul Wafadar and Minister of Civil Aviation Hasan Sharq were among the conspirators. General Watanjar was awarded a four-star rank and became the new Minister of Defence following his efforts against the coup plotters.

The season is connected to the X-Men film series, set in an alternate timeline where the X-Men have disappeared. It was produced by 20th Century Fox Television in association with Marvel Television, with Matt Nix serving as showrunner. Stephen Moyer and Amy Acker star as the parents, alongside Sean Teale, Natalie Alyn Lind, Percy Hynes White, Coby Bell, Jamie Chung, Blair Redford, and Emma Dumont. The show was ordered to series in May 2017, after a pilot was filmed in Dallas, Texas. Production on the rest of the season moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where the focus was on creating a grounded take on refugees. The season also deals with ideas of discrimination, and how the actions of some can become more extreme than others. The season aired from October 2, 2017, to January 15, 2018, over 13 episodes. It received mostly positive reviews from critics, particularly for its social commentary and cast. The Gifted was renewed for a second season on January 4, 2018.

His initial pitch for the series, \\"Running on Empty with mutants\\", was met with applause by executives. It was criticized for including too much story in the pilot, but Nix moved some of these ideas to later episodes. By January 2017, Nix hoped to see the season run for 12 or 13 episodes, rather than the traditional 22, while Fox chairman and CEO Gary Newman was expecting a final draft of the pilot script and planned to give a pilot pickup within a few weeks of that; Fox officially ordered the series to pilot at the end of the month, and to series, as The Gifted, in May. In August, Len Wiseman joined as a director and executive producer for the season, which consists of 13 episodes. =Writing= The series is not a procedural, and does not have a \\"save the mutant of the week\\" formula, instead following the ongoing story of the mutant underground as they both try to save other mutants and fight to protect themselves. Each episode does still have a beginning, middle, and end, including a flashback at the start of each episode focused on a particular character's history. Where the films and comics generally tell stories starting with the X-Men encountering \\"the world outside\\", Nix wanted to approach the story from the perspective of outsiders who are learning about the mutant world. The series also explores issues that reflect modern, real- world problems such as police attempting to kill mutants just because they look different, or the government only taking issue with mutants if they reveal themselves in public. The series' mutant underground is inspired by the Underground Railroad. A major struggle for the central parents of the series is that they are human and their children are mutants, and while they may sympathize with the mutants around them, \\"there's still a difference between them and the mutants and there's no getting around it\\". They also have to balance trying to help the cause with protecting their family. Noting a growing trend in shorter, self-contained television seasons, Nix said in October 2017 that he wanted The Gifted to feel more like a traditional, long- running story and have each season end in a satisfying way that does not feel \\"close-ended\\". The season's fourth episode was designed to launch the full story arc, reuniting the main characters following the events of the first three episodes and showing their changed mindsets‚Äîthe Strucker family gains a new appreciation of the mutant struggle for them to carry forward as they join the fight, while Polaris's time in prison has changed her outlook as well. The episode also reveals that mutants can be turned against each other in an adaptation of the Hound Program from the comics. The story arc of the season builds to a war that the X-Men believed was coming, and the series' characters having to decide how they wish to fight that war. It ends with the mutant Polaris having to decide whether she wants to follow the more extreme views of her father Magneto, or align herself more with the less extreme views of her boyfriend Eclipse. This creates the potential of two groups of mutants fighting each other, rather than uniting against Sentinel Services. Nix acknowledged that the final scene of the season is reminiscent of the end of the film X-Men: First Class, where Magneto recruits mutants for his own, more extreme group, but felt that this was a central theme to the X-Men and \\"constant throughout this universe. I think certainly we wanted to do our own version of that.\\" =Casting= In February 2017, Blair Redford was cast, later confirmed as John Proudstar / Thunderbird; Jamie Chung was cast as Clarice Fong / Blink, Stephen Moyer was cast as Reed Strucker; and Sean Teale was cast as Marcos Diaz / Eclipse. The next month, Natalie Alyn Lind joined as Lauren Strucker; Amy Acker was cast as Caitlin Strucker; Emma Dumont as Lorna Dane / Polaris; Percy Hynes White as Andy Strucker; and Coby Bell as Jace Turner. Elena Satine was revealed in August 2017 to have been cast in the series as Dreamer, a mutant who can \\"add or subtract\\" others' memories, to first appear in the second episode. In September 2017, Garret Dillahunt joined the series in the \\"key recurring role\\" of Roderick Campbell, and Skyler Samuels was revealed to have joined the series as Esme in November, soon said to be another \\"key recurring role\\" for the series. Esme was revealed to be one of the Frost siblings, with Samuels also portraying her sisters Phoebe and Sophie. Also appearing throughout the series are Hayley Lovitt, Jeff Daniel Phillips, and Jermaine Rivers as the mutants Sage, Fade, and Shatter, respectively; and Joe Nemmers as Ed Weeks, a Sentinel Services agent. =Design= The costumes for the pilot were designed by Louise Mingenbach, costume designer for several of the X-Men films. She worked to incorporate the mutant characters' abilities into their costumes, such as adding metallic elements to Polaris's costume like rings that she can use as weapons and steel-toed boots that she can use to levitate. Cameron Dale took over from Mingenbach for the rest of the season. For Dale, the most important aspect of the series' costumes was making them appear grounded and realistic for a refugee/on-the-run setting. This meant using clothing that would logically be worn in real life, such as typical clothes for teenagers to wear to high school, and then repeating elements throughout the season to show the characters having a limited set of clothes that gets aged the more they wear them. =Filming= Singer, the director of several of the X-Men films, decided to direct the series' pilot episode himself after a change in schedule for a film he was directing. He stressed that \\"tonally and visually it will be very, very different\\" from the films, and said that there will be \\"some stuff go down, visually, but at its heart it is a story about a family\\". Singer began prepping for production on January 27, 2017. Filming for the pilot, under the working title Heaven, began on March 13, 2017, in Dallas, Texas, and was completed by April 11. Some reshoots for the pilot had also been carried out by the end of that month. In May 2017, the Dallas Film Commission announced that the rest of The Gifteds episodes would not be filmed in the city. The series' production had put off the decision as long as they could, waiting for a decision on tax rebates in the state to be made by the Texas Legislature, but ultimately ran out of time and chose to film the rest of the series elsewhere. At the start of July, filming was revealed to be resuming in Atlanta, Georgia, beginning July 17. On filming in the state, Dumont stated, \\"We love filming in Georgia, because it was such a big part of the civil rights movement in the United States.\\" Because of this move, the series' setting was changed from Dallas to Atlanta (with the pilot episode retroactively changed to match this). Filming in Atlanta takes place at Atlanta Metro Studios, on a filming schedule of eight or nine days per episode, though more time was allocated to the filming of the second episode, which Nix felt was a \\"bigger\\" episode than the others. =Shared universe connections= Nix noted in July 2017 that the film X-Men: Days of Future Past established multiple, different timelines or \\"streams\\" in the X-Men universe, and that the series would take advantage of those to avoid the films and comics and instead do \\"our own thing\\". He explained that in the series' \\"stream\\", the X-Men have disappeared, due to a \\"bit of a 9/11 event, that caused enormous social upheaval and a lot of hatred towards mutants.\\" Nix later elaborated that it was a \\"necessity ... to stay out of the way of the movies\\" but he felt this worked as a \\"virtue\\" for the series, such as not mentioning Magneto by name to avoid the films, but still referencing the character in a way that makes it \\"a feature of the characters that they don‚Äôt really want to talk about\\" him, similar to Voldemort. Alternate versions of elements from the films appear in the season, including Sentinels, mutant- hunting robots that appeared in several of the films, and the company Trask Industries. To avoid clashing with the version of Bolivar Trask portrayed by Peter Dinklage in Days of Future Past, the writers chose not to include or mention that character at all and instead introduced the character of Roderick Campbell as the leader of the organization. Release=Broadcast= The season began airing in the United States on Fox on October 2, 2017, and ran for 13 episodes, concluding with a 2-hour season finale on January 15, 2018. It was broadcast in Canada on CTV, and in more than 183 countries on Fox, following its U.S. debut, using a \\"day-and-date launch\\" format. =Marketing= With the official series order, Fox released a brief teaser for the series which /Film's Jacob Hall described as \\"bland\\", particularly \\"arriving in the wake of Logan, Deadpool, and FX's Legion, each of which proved that there's plenty of gas in the tank for Mutantkind, provided that everyone involved is willing to really shake things up and go for broke.\\" This was followed a week later by a full length trailer for Fox's May 2017 Upfront presentation, which Hoai-Tran Bui, also of /Film, said \\"looks like a Singer take on Heroes.\\" Bui added, \\"The Gifted is a bit more by-the-numbers [than Legion], airing on a primetime network, spearheaded by X-Men movie director Singer, and clearly connected to the movie universe ... Whether that connection helps or hinders the series is yet to be seen‚Äîas is Singer's involvement, whose X-Men films become increasingly nonsensical and‚Ä¶bad.\\" The trailer had been viewed over 31 million times within a day of its release, including over 11 million views on YouTube. This was compared to the performance of the first trailer for This Is Us the year before, which went on to be a critical and commercial success. Also for Fox's Upfront, \\"government agents\\" from the series' Sentinel Services agency were running a mobile \\"Mutant Testing Center\\" in New York City on May 15, offering genetic tests to see if participants have the \\"mutant gene\\". The test results \\"about who they are and where they came from\\" would be mailed to the participants in about a month. Footage from the pilot was screened at a 2017 San Diego Comic-Con panel featuring cast and crew members, and the beginning of the second episode was debuted at a similar panel for the show at New York Comic Con later that year. Reception=Ratings= The series debuted higher than the season premiere of Lucifer in the same timeslot the year before, became a \\"solid ratings performer\\" for Fox, ranking the third best new drama series of the season, leading to a second season renewal. =Critical response= The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 74% approval rating, with an average rating of 6.67/10 based on 50 reviews. The website's consensus states, \\"The Gifteds first season lays a solid foundation for an involving superhero drama that powers past the origin-story doldrums by focusing on grounded, topical stories over mindless action and special effects.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 63 out of 100 based on 22 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Giving his first impression of the series' pilot for TVLine, Matt Webb Mitovich praised the \\"instantly engaging premise\\" and visual effects. He felt the entire cast was \\"solid\\", which he called \\"no easy feat with an ensemble this size\\", and also highlighted the clear establishment of the characters' relationships. He concluded by noting that the series would be facing tough opposition in terms of ratings, but that there was a chance for the show to be more successful than Gotham (which it replaced in Fox's airing schedule). Also reviewing the first episode, Dominic Patten of Deadline Hollywood praised the series as being superior to Marvel's Inhumans, and particularly noted its high stakes and timely themes. He did feel that there were elements in the episode that were derivative of Heroes, but ultimately summed up the episode as \\"quite good\\". Daniel Fienberg from The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"The Gifted gets points for including X-Men characters with some name recognition and for acknowledging its place within the bigger franchise. That, however, raises expectations, too, as does Singer's adroit work with a budget that no subsequent director is likely to have. Three or four effects-driven set pieces ... balance out the soapy family moments. I have very little confidence that The Gifted will be able to achieve that balance in subsequent episodes, but I'll definitely be watching to find out\\". Joshua Yehl of IGN felt the pilot \\"delivers everything you'd expect from a show based in the world of the X-Men ... It may not be as thought-provoking as Legion, but it doesn't try to be.\\" Yehl thought the best element of the series was how it \\"sets up a 'normal' family where the father makes a living off of sending mutants to jail and the son casually tosses out a mutant slur at the dinner table, and then forces those same people to rely on mutants to survive\\". =Comparison to Nazism= Discussing the series, Drew Koch of Bustle magazine noted that it explored themes such as the persecution of minority groups, sacrificing freedom for safety, and criticizing \\"big government\\". He highlighted the antagonistic agency Sentinel Services, feeling that giving it the initials \\"SS\\" was a reference to the Schutzstaffel, a paramilitary division of Nazi Germany. USA Today's Brian Truitt also noted this reference, and the character Polaris directly calling out the government agents as Nazis, along with the mutant underground being patterned after the Underground Railroad.

It has up to about ten leaves at the base of a flowering stem with up to sixty small pink and white flowers spirally arranged around it. Description Spiranthes australis is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with between three and ten linear to lance-shaped or spatula- shaped dark green leaves which are long and wide. Between ten and sixty bright pink flowers are crowded and spirally arranged along a flowering spike tall. The flowers are long and wide, ranging from deep pink to pure white. The dorsal sepal is lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals and petals are a similar size to the dorsal sepal but narrower. The labellum is white, has three obscure lobes and is about long. The labellum has a grainy texture and its edges are crinkled. Flowering occurs from October to March or later but the flowers are self-pollinating.Flower spike of S. australis in Barrington Tops National Park Taxonomy and naming Spiranthes australis was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The specific epithet (australis) is a Latin word meaning \\"southern\\". The taxonomic concept of this species has recently been expanded and its relationship with Spiranthes sinensis clarified. Distribution and habitat Austral ladies' tresses usually grows in boggy or swampy places but also in high-rainfall grassy places. It is widely distributed from the southern Caspian Sea of Iran and Georgia (reported as S. amoena, synonym of S. australis) to the southwest Pacific. In Australia, it occurs from Queensland, south through eastern New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria to Tasmania. It is sometimes also found in South Australia.

He was a committed Bonapartist throughout his political career. Early years (1816‚Äì48) Jean-Charles Abbatucci was born on 25 March 1816 in Zicavo, Corsica. He was the eldest son of Jacques Pierre Charles Abbatucci (1791‚Äì1857), a member of the Chamber of Deputies during the July Monarchy and a representative of the people at the Constituent Assembly of 1848 and the Legislative Assembly of 1849. Jean- Charles Abbatucci became an advocate in Orl√©ans. He was involved in politics from an early age. He attended the reformist banquet in 1847 in Orl√©ans with Pierre Marie and Adolphe Cr√©mieux. Second Republic (1848‚Äì51) When Cr√©mieux became minister of justice during the French Second Republic (1948‚Äì51) one of his first acts was to appoint Abbatucci substitute of the Attorney General in Paris. Charles Abbatucci was elected a deputy for Corsica in the National Legislative Assembly from 13 May 1849 to 2 December 1851 and joined the Bonapartist parliamentary group. In the same election his father was elected for Loiret. Charles Abbatucci supported the Bonapartist party from the start in words and deeds. He mixed with the editorial staff of the Elys√©e newspapers and with the Bonapartist committees in Paris and the departments, and recruited members. Second Empire (1852‚Äì70) After the coup d'√©tat of 2 December 1851 Abbatucci 's father was Minister of Justice from 1852 to 1857. His father was made a senator and his brother S√©verin Paul Abbatucci(fr) was a deputy throughout the Second French Empire. Abbatucci became his father's chief of staff at the Ministry of Justice, and was appointed Master of Requests (ma√Ætre des requ√™tes) at the Council of State in 1852. He became a councilor of state in 1857, holding this position until 1873. He was made an Officer of the Legion of Honour on 13 August 1861. Third Republic (1871‚Äì89) During the French Third Republic Abbatucci ran for Corsica in a legislative by-election on 9 June 1872 to replace Charles √âtienne Conti(fr), who had died in office. He campaigned on an openly Bonapartist platform and was elected by 30,323 out of 45,020 votes. He was a member of the National Assembly from 9 June 1872 to 7 March 1876, and sat with the Bonapartist Appel au peuple group. He voted, like them, with the majority of the right. He voted for the cabinet of Albert de Broglie on 16 May 1874, and on 23 July 1874 voted against the proposal of Jean Casimir-Perier on the organization of public authorities. On 29 July 1874 he voted for the Maleville proposal to dissolve the Assembly. On 25 February 1875 he voted against the constitution, which defined the republican form of government. Abbatucci was narrowly defeated in the 20 February 1876 elections for the Sart√®ne district, losing to Fran√ßois Marie Bartoli.(fr) After the House had been dissolved in 1877 he was the official candidate of the government, and easily won the election of 14 October 1877 against Bartoli. There were protests about the election concerning administrative pressure and other irregularities, but the deputy Adrien Joseph Prax-Paris reported that it was valid on 20 March 1879. Abbatucci remained with the Appel au peuple parliamentary group. He was not reelected on 21 April 1881. Jean-Charles Abbatucci died on 29 January 1885 in Paris.

It forms part of a dominantly transform boundary that is part of the southern margin to the North American Plate. It is an ultra-slow spreading center with an opening rate of 15‚Äì17 mm per year.  Formation  The Mid-Cayman Rise developed during the Eocene when the northern part of the Caribbean Plate collided with the Bahamas Platform, forcing the southern boundary to propagate southwards. This boundary initially formed as two strike-slip faults with a large left-stepping offset between them, generating a pull-apart basin. Continuing movement on the boundary and extension within the pull-apart led to the formation of an area of oceanic crust containing a north-south trending spreading center that remains active to the present day. When the spreading center formed, all the displacement on the Swan Islands Transform Fault was transferred by the Mid-Cayman Rise to the Septentrional-Oriente fault zone. During the Late Miocene, the leading edge of the Caribbean Plate began to collide with the Bahamas Platform. This led to the development of a new fault system, formed of the Walton fault zone and the Enriquillo‚ÄìPlantain Garden fault zone, carrying some of the plate boundary displacement and creating the Gon√¢ve Microplate. Eventually all the displacement on the plate boundary is expected to move onto the southern fault system as the microplate becomes accreted to the North American Plate, at which point the Mid-Cayman Rise will become extinct.  Hydrothermal Vents  ROV Jason II working at the Von Damm Vent Field in 2020. The Mid-Cayman Rise is a particularly unique location as there are two confirmed hydrothermal fields in close proximity of each other. The Von Damm vent field, named after geological oceanographer Karen Von Damm, is located on the ocean core complex Mount Dent, and features unique chimney structures of talc. The Beebe Vent field, after William Beebe, is the world's deepest hydrothermal system with extremely hot vent fluids. There is activity in the water column to suggest a third vent field, though it has not yet been identified.

A history of taxon  All representative of genus Eptesicus from Eastern and Southern parts of Ukraine used to be referred to the species Eptesicus serotinus before, a new species was isolated from serotinus. A species was described by Ukrainian zoologist (teriologist) Igor Zagorodniuk in 2009 as a new species for science based on the material from Luhansk Oblast. The taxonomy revision was conducted for the reason various mistakes in identification of Eptesicus species (as well as adjacent species, in particular Vespertili) occurred based on available identification guides. The primary Ukrainian name of the species (ukr. –ü–µ—Ä–≥–∞—á –¥–æ–Ω–µ—Ü—å–∫–∏–π) is associated with the Siverskyi Donets river, where the most of the records of the species were known on a moment of its description. As it is conceived in the species description, its name will be remained geographic but will be changed when the information on a species range will be expanded. The Latin name is associated with the presence of post-calcarial lobe on a calcar. the anatomy of the post-calcarial lobe of Eptesicus lobatus  Species characteristic features  The basis for the description was some morphological features of Eptesicus species from eastern species, which did not match the diagnosis of Eptesicus serotinus and genus Eptesicus in general. The key feature of the species is the presence of post-calcarial lobe in a calcar. According to all available literature sources, the post-calcarial lobe is not developed in the species of the genus Eptesicus; or absent, or looks like a narrow skin fold (see photo)  Distribition  Typical samples originated from several localities of Luhansk Oblast: Krasnodon city, Kolesnykivka village, \\"Novo-Il'yenko\\" Biological Station in Stanytsia-Luhanska Raion, surroundings of village Gannivka in Starobilsk Raion, near Brianka. The typical series ate stored at Benedict Dybowski Zoological Museum (University of Lviv). The known species range covers the basin of Siverskyi Donets River and the adjacent areas of Donets Ridge. It is assumed that the range of the species extends on East to Don and on South to North Caucasus and Pryazovia.  Ecology  A species is a typical inhabitant of the urban landscape, belongs to synanthropes. The most of records in repositories are associated with buildings (window frames, window sills, ceiling coverings, etc.). The species is easily recorded by ultrasound (approx. 25‚Äì29 kHz with a characteristic \\"drawing\\" of the sound). It is common in park areas, greened courtyards. It feeds mostly by large insects in flight.  Role in zoonoses  A species range which known at the moment is coincides with the absolute majority of all known cases of \\"bats\\" rabies transmission to human in Ukraine and Europe in general (in particular, in Kharkiv (1985); Luhansk (1997), Krasnodon (2002). In 2013 the presence of rabies virus was confirmed in a colony of a typical site (Novo-Il'yenko Biological Station).

The episodes coincided with the real-life events of the 1998 FIFA World Cup, with part three being broadcast as a segment within the BBC's coverage of the World Cup final itself. It was written by Sarah Harding, directed by John Derek, and executively produced by Matthew Robinson and Mal Young. The special focuses on Barry (Shaun Williamson), Robbie (Dean Gaffney), Huw (Richard Elis) and Lenny (Desune Coleman) finding a way to get to the 1998 FIFA World Cup. It also includes Roy (Tony Caunter) and Pat (Pam St Clement) sightseeing in Paris. The episodes received an average viewership of 7.87million in the United Kingdom. Plot=Part one= At Waterloo International railway station, Roy and Pat, who have two tickets to the FIFA World Cup final, are on their way to France via the Eurostar. Having rented a van, Barry, Robbie, Huw and Lenny are already there but become lost due to Robbie choosing to drink alcohol rather than give directions. The group need to reach Paris by 9.30 to pick up tickets for the World Cup from Charlie, who is selling them to Barry. On the Eurostar, Pat is becoming annoyed by excited football fans singing chants. Reminding her that it is the World Cup and that even more fans will be in Paris, Roy reassures her that they can still have a nice time. Meanwhile, the group's van has suddenly broken down, requiring the men to push it to the side of the road and find help. Lenny goes into a local bar and tries to speak French to a waitress called Karen. Laughing at his poor attempt, she replies in English. Now in France but unable to get a taxi, Pat and Roy walk down a street but Roy sees Barry hanging out of his van, so he rushes Pat into their hotel, Hotel Madison, to avoid her seeing Barry. In their room, Roy moans about the room size and the view from their windows. The men reach the bar where they plan to meet Charlie and he is already waiting and angry as they are 20 minutes late. Barry asks if he still has the four tickets he wanted but Charlie says that Barry only asked for two and that he can collect them the next day. The next morning, Roy moans about the size of the bathroom, but Pat tells him that as long as the room is clean and the bed is firm, then it is fine. The men wake up in the van and Barry brings them croissants and coffee as he feels guilty about only getting two tickets. =Part two= Pat and Roy come out of the Louvre museum. Roy is enjoying it, but Pat remarks that the Louvre Pyramid looks like a greenhouse. Pat is getting tired of Roy's quick stop tours and asks Roy to slow down. Barry admits to Robbie there are only two tickets, and he has chosen him to have the other. In the bar, Robbie has told Huw and Lenny about the tickets and everyone is annoyed at Barry, so Lenny suggests they draw lots to see who will get a ticket. Roy gives Pat a tour of the Notre Dame, but Pat is still having difficulties keeping up. Roy then walks past the Eiffel Tower without saying anything. Roy explains that Les Invalides houses the remains of Napoleon and points out a statue of The Thinker but says nothing to Pat. They return to their hotel. In the bar, Charlie gives Barry the tickets and the men draw straws; Huw and Lenny win the tickets. As they come out of the bar, they see their van being driven away by thieves. With nowhere to sleep, they go to Hotel Madison and knock on Roy and Pat's hotel room door. Roy opens the door and is horrified to see them. =Part three= In the hotel restaurant, Pat is outraged that Barry is in France and that Roy did not tell her. Pat says it is bad enough thinking of having to go home to Barry without having to share a hotel room with him and the others. Robbie and Huw thank Roy for allowing them spend the night in his hotel room. In a bar, a French woman asks if she can sit next to Robbie, and Robbie becomes love- stricken. Barry is wallowing, saying that he has always wanted to see the World Cup Final, but as usual things have conspired against him. Roy gives Barry his two tickets for the World Cup Final and tells him to enjoy it. Roy then apologises to Pat. Barry finds Robbie and tells him they are going to the final as he has another two tickets, and several people try to buy the tickets from Barry. Roy shows Pat The Kiss, a sculpture depicting two people kissing. Roy wishes he could just tell Pat how much he loves her and realises that he is blessed for having her. Pat acknowledges that Roy did the right thing by helping Barry and she says she is glad that they are in the most romantic city on Earth; Pat kisses Roy. At the stadium, everyone is excited for the final. Barry and Robbie show Lenny and Huw their tickets, and they all go in together to watch the match.

At the time of the announcement, it was not known which countries would be competing at the final, but the characters were reported to be supporting England, apart from Welshman Huw, who decides to support Scotland. The scenes were filmed two weeks from the time of the announcement being made, which is much nearer to transmission than most EastEnders episodes, but it was too early to include the finalists in the specials, so it was reported that the drama would take place away from any football match. It was reported that Barry's van would be \\"on its last legs\\" and their tickets would be \\"uncertain\\", making their trip \\"far from smooth\\". Shaun Williamson said of his character Barry, \\"He's already been the victim of a conwoman. Let's just hope his dodgy source for tickets shows up in Paris.\\" It was also reported that Pat would be unhappy with her trip, and Pam St. Clement said of her character, \\"She isn't the world's biggest football fan and she could think of far more romantic things to be doing in Paris.\\" The cast and crew spent four days in France filming the specials and the producers hoped that France would make it to the final to fit in with crowd scenes they had already filmed during the home nation's quarter- final tie with Italy. On 24 June 1998, it was confirmed that the episode following the specials would have two outcomes filmed, with one showing the returning characters celebrating England being successful and the other England being sent home early. =On-location filming= Roy takes Pat on a tour of Paris and they visit the below landmarks.

ITV soap Coronation Street also broadcast a World Cup special episode with characters preparing to watch the final, which achieved 13.29million viewers. However, a BBC spokeswoman said it was \\"completely unrealistic to compare the unconfirmed viewing figures of EastEnders short episode with a 50-minute special for Coronation Street.\\" Tom Shields from The Herald said, \\"Scanning the schedules for World Cup final day, we find the British Broadcasting Corporation chose to intrude an EastEnders special with a storyline which sent sundry thick and oafish characters to Paris.

She hosted Lucy Stone and husband Henry Blackwell when they came to Louisville, Kentucky for the American Woman Suffrage Association meeting‚Äîthe first suffrage convention in the South‚Äîin 1881. In 1890 she started the Woman's Club of Louisville, and in honor of her birthday, the suffrage club of Wyoming, New York, named itself after her. Early life The eldest of six children of Samuel and Polly Lommis Look, Susan Howes Look was born on October 27, 1817, in Conway, Massachusetts. She moved with her family to western New York where she grew up in a rural setting and among the many who were impacted by the Second Great Awakening in the \\"Burned-Over District.\\" She enrolled in the Utica Female Seminary at age seventeen and after graduation stayed to teach there. In 1843 she traveled to the village of Wyoming, New York with her sister Julia who had been hired to teach in Middlebury Academy there. On her way home, she visited friends in Aurora and there she met Benjamin F. Avery, an industrialist. Benjamin Avery and Susan married on April 27, 1844. The next year, they bought a summer residence - Hillside - in Wyoming which they shared with Susan's sister, Julia and her husband, Albert Capwell, a lawyer in Brooklyn, New York. On December 25, 1847, the Avery family moved to Louisville, Kentucky to start up an agricultural foundry and plow factory. By 1868, with the founding of a new firm B.F. Avery and Sons (Samuel and George with son-in-law J.C. Coonley), the Averys became one of the wealthiest families in Louisville. During the Civil War, the Avery Plow manufacturing buildings were converted into a Union soldiers' hospital and Mrs. Avery would bring the dying into her own home for hospice care. They were outspoken Unionists and family lore is that they were the first in Louisville to fly the U.S. flag despite the threats from the Knights of the Golden Circle. For two years during the Civil War, she toured Europe. In 1873 the Averys moved in to a mansion at Fourth and Broadway, the most fashionable residential area in the city. There, in 1885, Benjamin Avery died. Political and reform activities=Woman suffrage= Susan Look Avery hosted Lucy Stone and Henry Blackwell of the American Woman Suffrage Association when they were in Louisville for the national convention in 1881. When the Louisville Equal Rights Association started up in 1889, she was an important founding member. Avery also hosted many reformers at her summer residence, Hillside, once a spa in Wyoming, New York. According to her family, in her later years, she invited and hosted such notables as Susan B. Anthony, Reverend Anna Howard Shaw, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, and Booker T. Washington. =Temperance= Avery was a strong temperance supporter. She wrote: > Let us also thank God and take courage, that women, through whom sanitation > must come... are thinking and speaking on the subject - the prevention of > vice, crime and sorrow as never before; with an earnestness born of > conviction of responsibility and the fervent desire to meet it. =Women's club= In 1890 the first meeting of the Louisville Woman's Club was held in the library of her home in Louisville. Mrs. Avery, her daughter Helen, Mrs. Patty B. Semple, and Mrs. Andrew Cowan had drawn up the list of women to invite - and thirty-nine women accepted. Mrs. Avery was not present for this event, but she sent the following message from Chicago where she was staying with her daughter, Lydia Avery Cooley Ward: \\"Ladies, you have been invited here today for a great purpose. I have felt for a long time that women should not just sit back and talk about what should be done for the welfare of our country but should get together and do something about it.\\" She served second vice president for one year. In 1891 she became a charter member of the Warsaw Political Equality Club. And a year after she helped start another equal rights club in the village of Wyoming, they changed its name to the Susan Look Avery Club in 1901 in honor of her 83rd birthday. The club continues today as a social club for women. In September 1900, she hosted all the officers of the National American Woman Suffrage Association after their business meeting in Rochester, New York. She also served for many years as an honorary vice-president of the General Federation of Women's Clubs (GFWC). Her strong advocacy for the admission of African American women's clubs to the GFWC was in vain. =Pacifism= She spoke out against the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and the imperialistic treatment of the Philippines by the McKinley administration. > Since the first suggestion of the political equality of men and women came > to me, many years ago. I have been an ardent woman suffragist. A wise > statesman has said. \\"The first desire of every cultivated mind is to take > part in the great work of government.' When I think of present conditions, > not only In South Africa and the Philippines, but in our own nominally > Christian land, I am appalled by the apathy and indifference of intelligent > and in some ways thoughtful women.

If they could but realize the fact > that they are one-half of the people; that they are citizens, and that 'the > right of citizens to vote shall not be abridged.' I am sure that the world's > housekeeping would be improved. =Single tax, free trade and silver= Avery was an advocate for silver coinage and supporter of William J. Bryan. She was a guest of honor at the Second Annual Single Tax Conference held in Chicago in 1911 and spoke at the Fels Fund dinner to praise their stance on \\"the color line.\\" She said, > We can never be prosperous and blessed as a nation until we are just to the > colored man. We have many problems of deepest interest to be solved, to > which we cannot too soon or too earnestly address ourselves. Not only the > Singletax on land values, but woman suffrage, free trade the world over, and > I am very desirous that honest commerce shall perform the Christian > missionary work of the world. At present we are at vast expense of life and > treasure sending missionaries to people who are better than we -- and who > would be justified in sending missionaries to us.

This trip exposed Barth√© to classical art, but also to performers such as F√©ral Benga and Josephine Baker. He was thoroughly enchanted by Benga and led to Barth√© taking a sculpture of F√©ral Benga in 1935. In 1935, Benga's partner, Geoffrey Gorer, wrote Africa Dances, dedicated to Benga. It was the result of a trip they made to Africa in 1933 in order to study the native dances. Cyril Connolly would later said \\"There was only one book I possessed: Geoffrey Gorer's Africa Dances (Faber, 1935) describing a tour he made with the Senegalese dancer F√©ral Benga before the last war. Benga had opened a night- club in Paris; I had been there and been overwhelmed by the power of his dancing and the magic of his drum-rhythms.\\" Middle of the 1930s, Benga was painted by James A. Porter, in Soldat Senegalese. Back in Manhattan, Benga was a gay icon. He moved in the Harlem Renaissance circles and had also a brief affair with Kenneth Macpherson, who was at the time in a relationship with an African-American singer, Jimmie Daniels.

Called \\"Sudan‚Äôs idol of the youth‚Äù, he was a central figure for Sudanese music fans, opposing the military government of the day.  Life and artistic career  Mahmoud Abdulaziz was born in the Bahri district of Khartoum in 1967, and died in hospital in Amman in January 2013. His music was a blend of modern urban music from Sudan and Western pop music, with occasional other African influences. Even though his songs were banned on Sudan‚Äôs national television and radio during the years of Sharia-inspired Public Order Laws, when many singers, artists and politicians had to flee the country, because of conservative religious intolerance against popular music, Abdulaziz stayed in Sudan and continued to perform, risking arrest. At the time of his death, he had become a symbol for those wanting a more secular and less repressive Sudan. Abdulaziz recorded more than 30 albums, widely available in Sudan on cassette tapes or bootleg CDs. Several of the many YouTube videos with his music have more than one million views. An example for his great popularity is the attendance of several tens of thousands of his fans at the fourth anniversary of his death in Khartoum in January 2017.  Trivia  During a concert, a disabled fan, who could not get as close to the stage as he would have wanted, sought to catch the attention of his idol, and started waving his hands. This worked, and Abdulaziz mimicked his movements, and also came to greet the fan. Later, it became habitual for the artist to greet his devoted fans in this way, at every concert. Subsequently, crossed arms with index fingers pointing outwards became his symbol, and was in turn taken up by other fans. Even on his deathbed, Mahmoud was photographed in this pose.

Russia played a role of mediator, being both an ally with Britain, France, and the United States and negotiator with the elites of the Qing dynasty. Throughout the whole war period Russia provided minimal amount of military aid and used diplomatic power to present its interests in the conflict. As a result of the ratified agreements in 1860 Russia received former Manchurian lands along the Ussuri river and increased its economical influence on China. Background After the First Opium War in 1840 China was in a shaky situation due to onerous conditions of the ratified peace treaty and inner sociopolitical conflict within the nation: the weakening of the power of the Manchu emperors led to an open Taiping Rebellion and, most importantly, formation of the Taiping State, with which the government fought for many years ever since. In 1854 the alliance of Britain, France, and the United States came up with new, tougher demands: they wanted unlimited trade rights throughout entire China, admission of their permanent ambassadors to Peking (the closed part of the city), and the official right to trade opium. The Qing government rejected these demands, however this did not lead to an open conflict yet, since the main British military forces were focused on the battlefronts in Russia and Persia. First Encounter After a victorious campaign in the Crimean War of 1856, Britain transferred its focus on Qing China to further expand its political influence on the empire. On 8 October 1856 they found one: Chinese authorities arrested Arrow, a British commercial ship that was smuggling goods and selling opium. Britain demanded to free the sailors, as they believed the accusation was falsified, but their petitions were declined. In April 1857 Britain officially declared war against Qing China.Nikolay Pavlovich IgnatyevBritish military campaign was soon accompanied by France and the United States which had similar interests in this area. As the campaign proceeded with success, Russia realized that this could be an opportunity to expand its influence in the region. Victory of any of the sides did not satisfy the Empire: if China would win, Russia's chances of ratifying any treaty would be equal to zero. After all, even the territory north of the Amur called it \\"given to Russia for temporary use\\". If the allies would win, then in order to avoid competition they would not allow Russia to strengthen on the Pacific coast and themselves would occupy convenient bays from the mouth of the Amur to the border with Korea. Under these conditions, Russia would have only one chance of success - acting as an intermediary between the warring sides. This card also had to be played by a new Russian envoy in China. After completing a diplomatic mission in Crimea, General major Nikolay Pavlovich Ignatyev was assigned to negotiate with the Qing to ratify the Aigun Treaty, which would update the previous arrangements regarding territorial borders of two countries. The first attempt made by Ignatyev was unsuccessful: he was asked to leave the country as soon as possible, as this agreement was not in their interest. The diplomat refused to leave citing the orders he was given by his superiors. During this time, Ignatyev used all possible diplomatic arsenal - from assurances of eternal friendship of fraternal neighboring peoples to threats of military seizure of territories. Despite his efforts, the necessary result was not achieved. Ignatyev then decided to negotiate not with the Chinese, but the allied forces instead, so he went to Shanghai to do so. Thinly maneuvering between all the warring parties, he prevented any attempts of their rapprochement without his participation. One the one hand, he cheered the Chinese and gave them hope to win in this war. On the other, he lulled the vigilance of the allied forces, assuring that the existing land issues between China and Russia had already been settled and, therefore, his diplomatic service has no bad intentions. On May 20, 1858 Qing lost a major fortification during the battle for Taku forts and called for peace. On May 28 China was forced to sign the Aigun Treaty, despite the cabalistic conditions that Russia proposed: the sides agreed that the left bank of the Amur River from the Argun River to the mouth was recognized as Russian, and the Ussuri region from the confluence of Ussuri and Amur rivers all the way to the sea remained in common possession until the definition of the border. Also, naval routes on the Amur, Sungari and Ussuri were restricted to only Russian and Chinese vessels. This agreement replaced the previous territorial agreement, the Treaty of Nerchinsk, signed in 1689. Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689) After the Aigun Treaty the allied forces, with the help of General Ignatyev, signed the four positions of the Treaty of Tientsin. They stated the following: # Britain, France, Russia, and the U.S. would have the right to establish diplomatic legations (small embassies) in Peking (a closed city at the time) # Eleven additional Chinese ports would be opened for foreign trade, including Newchwang, Tamsui (former name of Taiwan), Hankou and Nanjing # The right of all foreign vessels including commercial ships to navigate freely on the Yangtze River # The right of foreigners to travel in the internal regions of China, which had been formerly banned # China was to pay an indemnity of four million taels of silver to Britain and two million to France. As a result, Russia did not use a single soldier and achieved success only using diplomatic power. Second Encounter (Third Opium War) Multiple historians separate the periods of the Second Opium War into pre-Tientsin Treaty and post-Tientsin Treaty periods and formally define the Third Opium War (1859-1860). This period was marked by the last resistant attempt from the Chinese not to ratify the previously signed treaties. The documents were planned to be ratified in Beijing in 1859. The Russian envoy arrived in the capital of China by land, but the British, French and American diplomats decided to arrive by sea. As they arrived Hai river on which supposedly stood the destroyed fort of Taku, allies saw that those fortifications were not only reconstructed, but fully armed and ready to fire. As the armies tried to enter Tientsin with force, they encountered strong military resistance, which meant that the war was resumed and the previous treaties were obsolete. Receiving severe losses in the battle, the allied forces had to retreat to Shanghai. The Russian mission in Beijing also strategically retreated to get a better picture of the situation. After regrouping the allied army marched through the previously conquered lands up to Beijing. At the end of September 1860, the allied force of 7,000 men approached the capital, winning several battles along the way. Due to severe disobedience of the Chinese, British forces were set to pillage Beijing and cause serious damage to its surroundings. The Russian envoy entered the city to join the negotiations. Immediately upon Ignatyev‚Äôs return on 3 October, he met with Chinese delegation in the Southern Compound of the Russian Spiritual Mission. The diplomatic officials were begging the Russian general to save the city from total destruction. He agreed to help, but set 5 conditions, under which this aid would be accommodated. Among the five conditions was the final ratification of the Treaty of Aigun and delineation along the Ussuri river to the Japanese Sea and the Chinese pickets in Western China. Being in a desperate position, Prince Gong had to agree with all conditions and asked Ignatyev to be the main negotiator on his behalf. The peace treaty negotiations took place in the premises of the Russian Mission. All translational difficulties were addressed to Ignatyev which he easily resolved. After the signing of the treaties, the attacking army left the borders of Beijing. Ignatyev made sure every official of the allied forces left, because the Treaty of Aigun was still kept in strictest secret. Russian historian V. M. Hevrolina described Ignatyev's diplomatic games as the following: The Treaty of Aigun (1858 - 1860) Consequences As a result of Ignatyev‚Äôs accomplishments and negotiatory work, the Chinese government immediately ratified the treaty on 14 November 1860, according to which Russia was affirmed both the left bank of the Amur River and the Ussuri River with all the maritime harbors to the bay Posyet and the Manchurian coast to Korea (or Primorsky region); the west border of the lake Nor-Zaysang in the Heavenly Mountains was considerably corrected; last but not least, Russia secured the right of overland trade in Chinese possessions. Soon, in 1860, the Russian Mission in the Far East would establish the city of Vladivostok securing the right of the land ownership acquired from the ratified treaty.

Luis de Almeida, 5th Lord of Avintes. The title was conferred in perpetuity upon the 4th Count by King Jos√© I of Portugal in the same document by which he was elevated to the Marquessate of Lavradio, later confirmed by Letters Patent dated 29 August 1766. Background It is probable that the ancient Seigniory of Avintes predates the foundation of Portugal itself. It is likely that the Seigniory was passed to the Brand√£o family in 1487, and in 1505, the benedictine Monastery of Saint Thyrsus, which had held it since the end of the XIII century, confirmed the Seigniory had been passed to the Brand√£o family in the person of Fern√£o Brand√£o Pereira, Knight Commander of S√£o Martinho de Guilhabreu in the Order of Christ and a nobleman at the Court of King Manuel I. He was appointed chamberlain to Prince Fernando, and was King Jo√£o III's ambassador to the King of Fez. His heirs would continue to hold important positions at Court. His granddaughter and heiress, Isabel Brand√¥a, 3rd Lady of Avintes, married D. Francisco de Almeida, Knight of the Order of Christ, Captain General of the Portuguese enclaves at Ormuz and Diu, Governor of Angola and General of the Armed Forces in Beira Province. Francisco was from an old, noble family which had reached prominence during the late 14th century. He was a great-grandson of the 2nd Count of Abrantes. His eldest son, D. Jo√£o de Almeida, nicknamed \\"O S√°bio\\", had only one surviving child by his wife D. Jer√≥nima de Castro, also named Isabel, who inherited the Seigniory of Avintes. She married her kinsman, D. Luis de Almeida, 5th Lord of Avintes by marriage and 1st Count of Avintes in his own right. Like his wife, D. Luis de Almeida was also descended from the 1st Count of Abrantes but by his second son, D. Diogo Fernandes de Almeida, 6th Prior of Crato. His father, D. Ant√≥nio de Almeida, was the head of one of the branches of the important Almeida clan and in addition to his own assets inherited substantial estates from his mother, D. Maria de Portugal, descended from the Counts of Vimioso and the Counts of Castanheira. Luis acceded to his parents' prosperous estate together with his father's commandaries of S√£o Martinho da Lordosa, Soalheira and Bemposta in the Order of Christ. In 1647 he was posted to Brazil as Mestre de Campo of one of the elite regiments of Royal Marines, where he served favourably during the War of Acclamation against Spain. He was later Governor General of Rio de Janeiro and, as a trusted courtier of the Queen Regent, D. Luisa de Gusm√£o, given the highly sensitive role of last Portuguese Governor General of Tangiers, with the responsibility of managing its transition to English rule in 1662, as part of the dowry of the Infanta Catarina on her betrothal to King Charles II. His experience as a soldier and administrator, as well as his position at Court, earned him the title of 1st Count of Avintes in 1664, during his final administrative posting as Governor General of the Kingdom of the Algarve, where he was stationed between 1663 and 1667 and where he also left his mark. As well as the Seigniory of Avintes, Isabel added significantly to her husband's already considerable house. Isabel's mother, Jer√≥nima, was the sole heiress in Portugal of D. Jo√£o Soares de Alarc√£o, Marquis of Turcifal and Count and Governor-General of Torres Vedras, through whom the 1st Count of Avintes gained extensive lands in Lisbon, Guarda, Santar√©m, Torres Novas and Torres Vedras. By his wife Isabel, Lady of Avintes, he had nine children, the eldest of whom, D. Ant√≥nio de Almeida, was his heir and successor.

The original magazine went defunct in 1987, and then Bessatsu changed its title to simply Kindai Mahjong in 1997. In February 2006, Gold ceased its publication and, in March, it was replaced by the short-lived , whose issuance lasted until June 2006. Original had its last issue released in December 2013, and then was reconceptualized as a female character-centered seinen magazine (aimed at adult males) titled , starting from January 2014. Content All Kindai Mahjong magazines feature manga series that involve mahjong, although they can vary in genre from comedy to romance or science fiction. Despite the similarities, each has its own editorial staff, emphasis, slogan, and artist line-up. Bessatsus focus is to promote tie-ins with other media, and as such features guest appearances by television personalities like Yoshikazu Ebisu, who wrote a manga in 1994. In addition to the manga, there are also informative articles. Gold, for example, constantly features mahjong former players, such as , who appears in photos, illustrating mahjong technique, and is portrayed as a character in manga. The magazine line also advertises mahjong parlors, and Original and Bessatsu also held women's mahjong tournaments and mahjong dating forums to attract female readers. Among the most popular series published in the magazine line are (1981‚Äì1989) by , Mahjong Hish≈ç-den: Naki no Ry≈´ (1985‚Äì1990) by , Akagi (1991‚Äì2018) by Nobuyuki Fukumoto, and The Legend of Koizumi (2006‚Äì2015) by Hideki Ohwada. The magazines also frequently serialize mahjong spin-off of manga originally published in other magazine's series, such as adaptations of Higurashi When They Cry, Iron Wok Jan, and Getter Robo. Reception By 1996, Original, Bessatsu and Gold had monthly circulation numbers around 180,000‚Äì200,000. At that time, the former two's average readership consisted of people aged 16‚Äì22, while the later was read by a public of more than 25 years old. Although most Kinda Mahjongs readers are male, comedy manga such as Super Zugan, attracted a considerable female readership. The Kinda Mahjong magazines were the only mahjong magazines that were not closed because of the effects of the Japanese asset price bubble in late 1980s. Although there were over ten publications in the genre, the recession and the \\"depressing image\\" the game had in that period, as Kindai Mahjong editor Michiyuki Miyaji put it, made most of them to close. Miyaji said one of the series that made possible the magazine line survival through that period was Naki no Ry≈´.

It consists of two disconnected segments. The southern segment begins at US 18 south-southeast of Parmelee and proceeds to a rural intersection just south of Norris. The much- longer northern segment, which is long, begins at an intersection with SD 44 just south of Corn Creek and ends at the North Dakota state line north of McLaughlin, where the roadway continues as North Dakota Highway 6 (ND 6). Portions of SD 63 north of US 14/SD 34 west of Hayes are part of the Lewis and Clark Trail. The segment of the highway, from US 14/SD 34 just west of Hayes, to US 212 west of Eagle Butte, is part of the Native American Scenic Byway. The portion of the highway, from just north of the intersection with SD 44 to a point approximately south of Belvidere, is a dirt road. Route description=Southern segment= The southern segment of SD 63 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 18 (US 18) south-southeast of Parmelee, in the northwestern part of both Todd County and the Rosebud Indian Reservation. After traveling westward through Parmelee, the highway crosses over Cut Meat Creek and then skirt along the northern edge of Eagle Feather Lake. It curves to the north-northeast and makes a stairstep pattern to the west before resuming a northward path. At an intersection with the appropriately-named County Line Road, the highway leaves Todd County and the Rosebud Indian Reservation and enters the southwestern part of Mellette County. SD 63 crosses over Gray Eagletail Creek and then curves to the west. Just south of Norris, it curves to the north and immediately meets its northern terminus, an intersection with the northern terminus of 246th Avenue. =Northern segment=Mellette County SD 63 resumes approximately to the north, just south of Corn Creek, in the west-central portion of Mellette County, at an intersection with SD 44\\\\. At the northern end of Corn Creek, just south of an intersection with Wooden Knif Lane, the pavement ends, and the roadway becomes a dirt road. It curves to the north-northeast and crosses over Black Pipe Creek. The highway winds its way to the north and slightly bends more to the west. At a second crossing of Black Pipe Creek, it enters the northeastern part of both Jackson County and the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. It also enters the Mountain Time Zone. Jackson County At a crossing of the White River, SD 63 leaves the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. It curves to the north and enters Belvidere. At an intersection with D Street, the dirt road ends and the paved portion resumes. on the northern edge of Belvidere, it intersects the former path of SD 248\\\\. Then, it has an interchange with Interstate 90 (I-90). Here, I-90 and SD 63 travel concurrently to the east. Almost immediately, they cross over Brave Bull Creek. The eastbound lanes have a rest area before the roadway curves to the northeast. The westbound lanes then have a rest area before the highways split. SD 63 heads to the north- northwest and curves to the north, before resuming its north-northwest direction. SD 63 then enters the southeastern part of Haakon County. Southern Haakon County SD 63 continues to the north-northwest. It crosses over the Bad River and then crosses over some railroad tracks of the Rapid City, Pierre and Eastern Railroad before cutting across the southeastern part of Midland. Just after leaving the city limits of Midland, it intersects US 14\\\\. Here, it turns right and travels concurrently with US 14, while the roadway continues as 248th Avenue. Almost immediately, US 14/SD 63 re-enter Midland. The last intersection in Midland, the appropriately-named Midland Avenue, leads to the business district of the town. The concurrency curves to the north-northwest. After a curve to the north-northeast, they head to the north again. Then, they enter the southwestern part of Stanley County. Stanley County US 14/SD 63 travels due north and slide slightly to the east just before they split. They intersect SD 34 approximately west of Hayes. US 14 follows SD 34 east of this intersection, while SD 63 follows SD 34 west for about . When SD 63 splits off, it travels due north to the northwestern part of the county. It then slides slightly to the west and resumes its northward trek. It curves to the west-northwest and re-enters Haakon County, this time in the northeastern part of the county. Northern Haakon County SD 63 curves to the west-southwest and crosses over Sage Creek. The highway curves to the north-northwest and crosses over Hermaphrodite Creek. The highway then crosses over the Cheyenne River. Here, it enters the southeastern part of Ziebach County and the south-central part of the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation. Ziebach County SD 63 crosses over Dupree Creek. It then curves to the northwest and then to the north. At an intersection with Airport Road, which leads to Cheyenne‚ÄìEagle Butte Airport, the highway enters Dewey County. Dewey County SD 63 begins to skirt along the western edge of North Eagle Butte. It intersects US 212 on the northwestern edge of the census-designated place (CDP). US 212 and SD 63 travel concurrently to the east, along the northern edge of the CDP. They enter the city limits of North Eagle Butte and pass some sewage disposal ponds. After leaving the city limits, they skirt along the southern edge of the CDP. When SD 63 splits off to the north, it skirts along the eastern edge of North Eagle Butte. It curves to the north-northwest and skirts along the eastern edge of Green Grass. It crosses over the Moreau River and curves back to the north. Approximately east-northeast of Firesteel, it intersects SD 20\\\\. The two highways travel concurrently in a due-east direction, while the roadway continue as County Road 3B (CR 3B). They curve to the east-northeast and cut through the northern part of Timber Lake. They curve to the north- northeast and north, before curving back to the east. SD 20/SD 63 then travel along the Dewey‚ÄìCorson county line. SD 63 splits off from SD 20 about west of Trail City. It travels in a due-north direction and enters the southeastern part of both Corson County and the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. Corson County SD 63 curves to the north-northeast and crosses over the Grand River. It then curves to the north-northwest and skirts along the western edge of Little Eagle. It curves back to the north and then enters McLaughlin. There, it has an intersection with US 12\\\\. Immediately after this intersection is a crossing of some railroad tracks of BNSF Railway. The highway crosses over Oak Creek and continues to the north to the North Dakota state line. Here, SD 63 intersects 100th Street and reaches its northern terminus, while the roadway continues as North Dakota Highway 6 (ND 6). History In the mid-1920s, a southern segment of SD 63 traveled from the Nebraska state line, south of Olsonville to Murdo. This changed in 1927, when SD 63 was truncated to end at US 14, and the former southern segment was renumbered SD 59\\\\. In the 1960s, extensions of SD 63 were implemented. Around 1960, SD 63 was extended south to US 16 near Stamford. By 1965, it was placed on a concurrency with SD 40 (now SD 44) south from Belvidere, ending west of Cedar Butte. By 1971, it was extended to US 18 near Parmlee, where it currently ends. On the northern end of the highway, SD 63 originally did not exist north of Timber Lake (the original northern terminus of SD 63). Around 1944, another segment of SD 63 from McLaughlin to North Dakota was added, replacing SD 61. Between 1948 and 1953, the highway was realigned to begin approximately east of Firesteel. Between 1965 and 1971, the far northern segment was extended south from McLaughlin to SD 20, then west to connect with the other segment. A resolution in the 2007 legislative session urged South Dakota Department of Transportation (SDDOT) to work to connect the two segments of the highway. Currently, the segment in between is a county road, which has over 400 vehicles per day travel on it.

Founded in 2013, NuDay is headquartered in New Hampshire. Since the start of the Syrian Revolution, NuDay has shipped millions of dollars worth of clothes, medicine, and food to displaced families in Syria. It also provides help for the housing, work and schooling of Syrian refugees in Turkey. In 2017, NuDay undertook 480 projects inside Syria and within Turkey's Syrian refugee camps, benefiting over 881,400 people. In recent years, NuDay has re-asserted its focus on protection and livelihood, which guarantee long-term impact and empowerment. Education and psychosocial support are key to NuDay's work. History Founder Nadia Alawa is a female empowerment advocate and fundraised locally for humanitarian causes before founding the organization in 2013. She started local fundraising soon after the Syrian Revolution broke out. As she successfully collected several containers of clothing, food and supplies for aid agencies, she realized she would be more efficient if she had her own organization. In February 2013, NuDay was founded as a 501(c)(3) organization. By mid-2013, thousands of people had been involved from across New England. By May 2015, NuDay had sent 53 shipping containers with medical supplies, clothing, food, and toys to conflict zones in northern Syria. Alawa raised $1 million for other kinds of help: smuggling goats into a besieged area near Damascus to produce milk for babies; finding housing and work for Syrian refugee widows in Turkey and opening a school for refugee children there. When other relief organizations would not distribute sleeping bags designed by MIT students, NuDay undertook their distribution in Syria. NuDay also launched a fundraising campaign to cover medical bills and provide prosthetic arms for Ahmad Alkhalaf, a boy who drew attention to Syrian refugees by writing a letter to the president at the time, Barack Obama. Alkhalaf and Alawa attended the State of Union in 2016, on the invitation of Representative Seth Moulton. Operations Syrian children attend a NuDay-operated school. NuDay is a registered international relief organization that provides both immediate humanitarian assistance and long- term, socio-economic and educational programming for Syrian women and children. Through this work, NuDay aims to build bridges from families in the US to families inside Syria. For almost a decade, Syria has been in an unstable situation. As a result, children are vulnerable, and an entire generation has become accustomed to a life filled with uncertainty and without access to education. Women, in the hopes of supporting their family, may resort to desperate actions, which NuDay seeks to stop. NuDay focuses on bringing housing and food to displaced families with single mothers or wounded family members in Syria. The organization's board is made up almost entirely of women. Its aid consists of in-kind donations and funding programs. NuDay volunteers collect donations in mosques, churches, and clinics across New England. Almost the entire operation is run on Facebook and WhatsApp. They send containers with aid to Turkey, where a NuDay employee drives them to the Syrian border. Syrian partners include expatriates, local survivors of regime persecution, and Arab Spring activists. They distribute the aid in non- government-controlled areas of northern Syria, but not in regions controlled by Bashar al-Assad or ISIL. Ratings GuideStar gave the organization a \\"Platinum Seal of Transparency.\\" As of May 2018, Charity Navigator rates the organization among their highest-rated charities, having the highest level of engagement and effectiveness with funding, donors, and projects.

Curig is a retired Philippine Army enlisted trooper and a recipient the Philippines' highest military award for courage, the Medal of Valor. Action against the Abu Sayyaf In March 2000, Abu Sayyaf militants abducted approximately 28-29 civilians including schoolchildren, a Catholic priest and two teachers in Basilan. Curig was part of a Scout Ranger unit under the command of Major Roberto Caldeo tasked with pursuing the kidnappers and rescuing the hostages. On 28 April 2000, Curig's unit assaulted the Abu Sayyaf camp where the hostages were being held. The Scout Rangers were able to surprise the Abu Sayyaf militants but due to advantage in terrain, the militants were able to pin down the government security forces and hold their ground. On the third day of the operation, Caldeo decided that two squads of Scout Rangers would have to volunteer and make an all-out assault up the steep terrain to clear out the bunkers keeping the rest of the government forces pinned down. Curig volunteered for one of the \\"suicide squads\\". After four hours of intense fighting, they managed to clear the bunkers as the Abu Sayyaf retreated. Recovered were the beheaded bodies of the two hostaged teachers. Curig was conferred the Medal of Valor for his actions during the battle.

First published in 1907, its age and historicity are disputed among scholars.  Narrative  The Chronicle of Arbela relates the history of Nestorian Christianity in Adiabene, a \\"northern Mesopotamian province located between the two Zab rivers\\" in what is modern Iraq. Arbela was an \\"important junction point on major east-west and north-south caravan routes, and has been an occupied site since remote antiquity.\\" A short devotional introduction describes the work as a history, in the form of a letter to one Pinhes, chronicling the history of all the bishops of Adiabene, and its martyrs.Beginning section of Chronicle of Arbela, as translated in 1985 by Timothy Kr√≥ll, as volume 468 of the Corpus Scriptorum Christanorum Orientalium series, a joint product of the Catholic University of America and Louvain Catholic University in Belgium.

The next bishop, Hairan (bishop 217-250), oversaw Arbela during the end of the Parthian empire, at which time Arbela was incorporated into the Sasanian Empire. Unlike the Romans, or the Sasanians which followed Persia, Christianity was somewhat more tolerated by Persians and spread accordingly.Chapter 8, Chronicle of Arbela, as translated in 1985 by Timothy Kr√≥ll, as volume 468 of the Corpus Scriptorum Christanorum Orientalium series, a joint product of the Catholic University of America and Louvain Catholic University in Belgium.  History =Period history= Parthian Empire 1 AD Sassanian Empire 750 AD showing Adiabene to the East of Antioch Allegedly written in the 6th century in classical Syriac the chronicle takes the form of a liber pontificalis. \\"Mƒï≈°ƒ´·∏•ƒÅ-Zƒï·∏µƒÅ drew primarily on ... Habel the Teacher, whose reports reveal that Christianity had spread east of the Tigris, in Adiabene, before 100... The Chronicle ends during the term of the patriarch MƒÅr ƒÄ·∏áƒÅ of Seleucia-Ctesiphon (540‚Äì552).\\" The historical accuracy of the chronicle is disputed. \\"By the time of Trajan's invasion of Adiabene in 115 or 116 AD, the satrapy had been ruled by a Jewish dynasty for more than 75 years. According to the Chronicle of Arbela, Christianity firmly rooted itself in Adiabene in Trajan's time. This tradition has been rejected by several historians, most notably F. C. Burkitt.\\" Burkitt says a Syriac speaking version of Christianity was in Adiabene and there were bishops in Arbela before the collapse of the Parthian empire, but after the conversion of Abghar in Edessa around 200. Tertullian and others confirm there were Christians in Persia before the Sassanians [in 224] but give no indication how long they might have been there. Burkitt is contradicted by other information. Eusebius, in HE 1.13.1-22 and HE 2.1.6-7 writing before 324 AD, records from a Syriac source that Thomas sent Thaddaeus (in Syriac 'Addai') \\"one of the seventy disciples\\" to preach in Edessa. Others dismiss this claim and argue for Tatian as the founder of the church in Persia. \\"Samuel Hugh Moffett, under the title \\"Tatian the Assyrian,\\" writes that the first verifiable historical evidence of Christianity is provided by the life and work of Tatian (c. 110‚Äì180 AD) after the middle of the second century.\\" \\"Whatever conclusions we draw from these and other traditions\\", not only is there \\"firm evidence for the existence of Christians in the area by AD 170\\", there is also \\"extensive evidence for the movement of Christianity eastwards, in the earliest centuries, from bases in Arbela in Adiabene and Edessa in Osrhoene.\\" \\"The Chronicle assumes Christianity reached the satrapy [of Adiabene] by 100 AD, and Eduard Sachau considers the tradition sound.\\" According to Luke's account in Acts 2:9, those who responded first at Pentecost were 'Parthians and Medes and Elamites and residents of Mesopotamia'.\\" Tradition also says many \\"fled eastwards after the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD\\". \\"One of the first Aramaic-speaking Christian centers might have been Adiabene...where the local ruling house had converted to Judaism in about 40 AD. This Jewish city-state had regular contacts with Palestine, and it seems possible that through this route Christianity reached Adiabene as early as the first century.\\" With Adiabene as a possible refuge from persecution elsewhere, the number of Christians grew markedly \\"so that by AD 235 they had more than 20 Bishops and some 18 dioceses.\\" After the conversion of King Abgar VIII (r. 179‚Äì212) of Edessa, the Aramaic language (later called Classical Syriac) spread and became the lingua franca for a wide variety of Aramaic speakers. \\"The revitalization of Zoroastrianism under the Sassanid rulers [in the third century] brought with it a revitalization of the [historic] Pahlavi language of the Persians as well.\\" Whereas the church's established status facilitated their continued use of Syriac instead of Pahlavi.\\" \\"The Syrian churches of today all trace back their origin to the Christian communities that developed in Syria and Mesopotamia in the second and third centuries, especially to those that in this period used some variety of Aramaic rather than Greek as their primary language.\\" From 53 BC to about 215 AD, the \\"two super-powers\\" Rome and Persia repeatedly \\"engaged each other in a vicious cycle of invasions and counterattacks\\". \\"Throughout the third century, the border zone between the Romans and the Sassanids remained a region of conflict. Cities passed back and forth between the two powers, affecting the churches within them.\\" \\"The Syriac [Christian] churches straddled the Late East Roman and Early Byzantine empires, as well as the Parthian and Sassanian empires (in Persia). The Syriac Christian tradition thus found itself in two opposing worlds, [west and east] both of which it needed to accommodate, and both of which would sporadically and violently persecute it.\\" In 224‚Äì226 AD, Parthian rulers of the Persian empire that embraced Adiabene and Arbela, fell to a coalition force of southern Medes and Persians, with the collaboration of Adiabene. The Sassanid empire began. The new ruler assumed the title of \\"Shah of Shahs\\" and vigorously began defending the state religion, Zoroastrianism. The next generation saw \\"an imperial revival of the Zoroastrian faith among the Sassanids that eventually brought about brutal persecution of Christians in the Persian empire.\\" \\"It is impossible to estimate the numbers [of Christians in the Persian empire by this time] but we know that they formed a substantial minority of the population and on the whole were well educated and famous for their skills in medicine and the sciences.\\" In 258 AD, Shapur the First pushed west, besieged Edessa, captured emperor Valerian and vast numbers of prisoners were brought into Persia. Many of these were Christians. \\"The first figure of the Christian church who emerges clearly is Papa who became Bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon around 300 AD. The Chronicle references Papa and from Papa onward there is good support for the historicity of the text. On Good Friday, April 17, 341, Shapur the second had 100 Christians put to death beginning a persecution lasting nearly forty years without remission, calling them \\"traitors who shared sentiments with Caesar.\\" \\"The persecution was reported to be very fierce between AD 344 and 367 in Susiana and Adiabene with some 16,000 names listed as martyrs, which points to an even larger number of victims.\\" By the late fourth century, Christianity is recognized as a legitimate minority with a decree of toleration from Yazdgard I. Some persecution returns under Bahram V. and in \\"AD 422 a new treaty is signed between Persia and the Roman Empire which guaranteed freedom of worship to Christians in Persia.\\" =Article history= There was little interest in the history of Christianity in Iraq before 1840 when it was stimulated by news of massacres in the highlands above Arbela. \\"Copies of Syriac manuscripts recovered from the churches and monasteries of northern Iraq and southeastern Anatolia, gradually filtered into Europe, where they supplemented collections acquired from Egypt and Syria. Publications based on these East-Syrian manuscripts between circa 1880 and 1910 ... preserved dozens of previously unknown Syriac texts.\\" The Chronicle of Arbela was first published in 1907 by the theologian Alphonse Mingana. It is alleged to have been written in the sixth century. The Chronicle \\"provides more detailed information about the early history of the church of the East than any other literary source\\". It was used by a \\"whole generation of scholars\\" until 1925, when some scholars in Syriac literature first began raising questions about its historical reliability. Literary historian Paul Peeters questioned the text's authenticity and reliability and called for a re-examination in 1936. In 1967, a \\"scathing critique\\" by Church historian Jean-Maurice Fiey challenged the Chronicle's reliability as a historical source. In 1995, the historian Erich Kettenhofen defended the possibility the Chronicle is a medieval compilation. In 2006, historian Joel Walker asserted forgery by Alphonse Mingana. In 1959, social scientist Paul Kahle wrote a book supporting the authenticity of the Chronicle, saying that Christianity reached Adiabene at an earlier date than previously thought due to the conversion of the Jewish ruling family. He concludes, \\"similarities with the Edessene Abgar (c. 200 AD) are the result of that legend having its origins in Arbela and was only adapted to Edessa at a later date.\\" Other scholars who have supported the (at least partial) authenticity and historical credibility of the Chronicle include Carl Eduard Sachau, orientalist (1915), Adolf von Harnack, theologian and historian (1924), and Sebastian Paul Brock, scholar in Syriac languages (1967 and 1992) who also says the account of the early spread of Christianity in the Parthian period cannot have any historical basis. Historian Peter Kawerau wrote in 1985 and 1991 that authenticity is confirmed by \\"the bi-lingual inscription at Bƒ´≈°ƒÅp≈´r and by the mention in the text of a solar eclipse that occurred on 10 July 218\\". Professor of Iranian Studies Marie Louise Chaumont (1988), among many others, support the text as having historical credibility.  Authorship  The Chronicle of Arbela was \\"first published by Alphonse Mingana in 1907.\\" He attributed it to a \\"little known church historian of the sixth century,\\" 'M≈°ƒ´hƒÅ-ZkƒÅ' \\"(a compound East- Syrian name meaning 'Christ has conquered')\\". Historian Joel Walker has asserted the author of the text was Mingana himself based on his knowledge of Mar Qadagh. Kettenhofen says the author was most likely a medieval author working from a pool of narrative traditions that contributed to all three heroes in both the text of Arbella and Qardagh. Christelle and Florence Jullien, \\"while conceding Mingana's manipulation of the text, have vigorously defended the Chronicle as a legitimate East-Syrian source\\" that reflects an \\"early documentary core\\" and a Syrian author.  Thematic connections  The Chronicle includes the stories of two key characters: \\"Gufra≈°nasp the mohapat of Adiabene\\" in third-century Greater Iran during the rule of the Sasanian emperor, Bahram II (c. 274‚Äì291 AD), and Raqbakt, a ruler with an unspecified leadership position in Adiabene. Their combined careers resemble the historical figure of Mar Qardagh, a Sasanian marzban (guard) of Upper Mesopotamia, who became a Christian martyr c. 360 during Shapur II's large- scale persecution of Christians. The \\"History of Mar Qardagh\\" and the Chronicle of Arbela have thematic connections through these characters. Some of the similarities between Arbela and Qardagh are: Raqbakt had a public office such as viceroy, possibly a governor, as did Mar Qardagh. They both converted to Christianity, led an army of foot soldiers to protect the land, and served their king through many military victories. \\"He (Rakbakt) was fatally wounded by a spear thrust into his side and 'gave up his spirit like Judas Maccabee'.\\" \\"The echoes are closer still in the case of Gufra≈°nasp, whom the Chronicle depicts as a pious Magian, who revolts against the Persian King of kings and defends his fortress in Adiabene by heroic archery. Although neither Rakbakt nor Gufra≈°nasp provide an exact model for Qardagh, their combined careers contain many of the central features of the Qardagh legend.\\"  References  External links  Chronicle of Arbela, English translation by Timothy Kr√≥ll.

'Free Voice of Labor') was a Yiddish-language anarchist newspaper published from New York City's Lower East Side between 1890 and 1977. It was among the world's longest running anarchist journals, and the primary organ of the Jewish anarchist movement in the United States; at the time that it ceased publication it was the world's oldest Yiddish newspaper. Historian of anarchism Paul Avrich described the paper as playing a vital role in Jewish‚ÄìAmerican labor history and upholding a high literary standard, having published the most lauded writers and poets in Yiddish radicalism. The paper's editors were major figures in the Jewish‚ÄìAmerican anarchist movement: David Edelstadt, Saul Yanovsky, Joseph Cohen, Hillel Solotaroff, Roman Lewis, and Moshe Katz. Protesting against the injustices of the Haymarket trial, Jewish anarchists in New York formed the Pioneers of Liberty to support the defendants. From this effort, area anarchist groups resolved to publish Fraye Arbeter Shtime, which would become an amalgam of labor paper, literary magazine, and journal of radical opinion. The group held an annual December conference with anarchists and socialists, as well as events like the Yom Kippur ball. Interest in the paper mirrored Jewish‚ÄìAmerican interest in anarchism, surging in the 1880s/90s, experiencing its heyday in the 1910s/20s, and declining between and afterwards through its demise in the 1970s. The paper struggled financially in its early years and went dormant in the late 1890s. The paper thrived under Yanovsky in the 20th century's first two decades, with a high literary standard and circulation of 20,000 before the Great War. It retained its quality through the 20s under Cohen, but by the 30s, the Jewish anarchist movement grew more conciliatory, less revolutionary. The paper slowed its cadence from weekly to fortnightly to monthly before winking out of existence with the rest of the movement in the mid-1970s. History The 1886 Chicago Haymarket affair and the perceived injustices of its ensuing trial led to a resurgence of interest in anarchism, particularly among Jewish radicals. In New York, the first Jewish anarchist group in the United States, the Pioneers of Liberty, formed to campaign in support of the Haymarket defendants. Their work included production of Yiddish literature on the case. From early to mid-1889, the group ran the weekly Varhayt (Truth), the first Yiddish anarchist periodical in the United States and, technically, the first Yiddish periodical dedicated to anarchism in the world. The Pioneers of Liberty then proposed a joint anarchist‚Äìsocialist newspaper and in consideration, convened a landmark first meeting of Jewish‚ÄìAmerican radicals from across the country at the end of the year. The proposal narrowly failed and the Jewish anarchists and socialists ultimately created their own publications. In January 1890, the Pioneers of Liberty and other anarchist groups resolved to create the Fraye Arbeter Shtime. The paper would claim to represent 32 Jewish workers' associations. Speakers affiliated with the group toured the East Coast and Midwest to fundraise for the new newspaper. An interim periodical, Der Morgenshtern (The Morning Star), ran between January and June 1890 under the editorship of the physician Abba Breslavsky. Shortly after Der Morgenshtern close, Fraye Arbeter Shtime first published on July 4, 1890, from the Lower East Side, and continued weekly for nearly 90 years. Historian Paul Avrich described the paper's functions as manifold: \\"a labor paper, a journal of radical opinion, a literary magazine, and a people's university\\". Its coverage ranged from translated Johann Most and Peter Kropotkin essays to Yiddish poems on social conditions to reworked translations of major natural, social science, and literary texts, including Karl Marx's Capital and Ivan Turgenev's On the Eve. The newspaper also acted as a hub for Jewish radical activity. The group held an annual December conference in which socialists and anarchists met to discuss their joint movement, such as positions on organized labor and Yom Kippur balls. French anarchist Elis√©e Reclus visited in 1891 and encouraged the newspaper editors to open a libertarian school. Roman Lewis became the Fraye Arbeter Shtime first editor after the British socialist Morris Winchevsky declined. Lewis was a regular contributor, conversant in both Yiddish and Russian, and a convincing speaker and fundraiser. After a short, six-month tenure, he left for the cloakmakers' union and socialists in late 1890. The second editor was the essayist and translator J. A. Maryson, one of the few Pioneers of Liberty to become proficient in English. Third was David Edelstadt, a buttonhole maker from Cincinnati and among the first Yiddish labor poets, having published in Varhayt and Der Morgenshtern. He left the editorship in late 1891 after contracting tuberculosis and moving west to seek a cure. He continued to send the newspaper his poems until his death a year later. Hillel Solotaroff and Moshe Katz, who would later translate anarchist classics, served as editors after that point. The paper's initial years of publication were dogged with financial issues. Foremost, the core audience‚Äîimpoverished workers‚Äîhad little money. The paper suspended printing during a typesetter wage dispute beginning in May 1892. Later that year, Alexander Berkman's prominent assassination attempt on Henry Clay Frick divided the movement, as some anarchists left the movement to denounce all forms of terrorism. As the wage dispute came to a close nearly a year later, the United States entered an economic depression, the Panic of 1893. By April 1894, the Fraye Arbeter Shtime group again stopped production, ending an era of Jewish anarchism as the Pioneers of Liberty and other groups waned or went defunct. In these dormant years, Fraye Arbeter Shtime editors assisted in the launch of the monthly Di Fraye Gezelshaft. Five years later, Fraye Arbeter Shtime revived publication in October 1899 and Jewish interest in anarchism rekindled with it. Its new editor, Saul Yanovsky, would serve through 1919, a heyday for both the newspaper and the Jewish anarchist movement. It was also a period of stability for the paper, with readership above 20,000 prior to World War I. Yanovsky's own column was popular for its wit, and he selected numerous talented writers with fresh views. Alongside Kropotkin, Most, and Solotaroff, the editor added Rudolf Rocker, Max Nettlau, Emma Goldman, Voltairine de Cleyre, and Abraham Frumkin. The paper ran translations of cultural works (e.g., Henrik Ibsen, Olive Schreiner, Oscar Wilde) and pieces by major Yiddish writers (e.g., Avrom Reyzen, H. Leivick). This selection made the paper both readable and alluring among Yiddish readers. The movement had also drifted from the zealous 1880s and 1890s in which social revolution felt imminent and propaganda of the deed justified. Yanovsky turned against terrorism and regarded anarchism as a philosophy of brotherhood, cooperation, and dignity, and the paper took a piecemeal approach to reform, in favor of libertarian schools and cooperative unions. While the 1901 assassination of William McKinley by an anarchist roiled Yanovsky, Fraye Arbeter Shtime bore part of the fallout, as an angry mob trashed the paper's offices and physically attacked its editor. Additionally, anarchist Jews also tempered their antireligious confrontation to be less pronounced, and some took up Zionism after the Kishinev pogrom. The paper paid special attention to anarchist luminary Peter Kropotkin, who was especially popular among American‚ÄìJewish anarchists. Fraye Arbeter Shtime prepared a supplement with photographs from his second United States lecture tour in 1901, but Kropotkin requested its cancellation and that he not be made into an icon. The paper, together with Emma Goldman's Mother Earth, also planned a 70th birthday celebration for Kropotkin at Carnegie Hall in 1912. A special Fraye Arbeter Shtime issue highlighted Kropotkin's life and thought. The paper also followed Kropotkin in endorsing the Allies of World War I, as the only major American anarchist publication to do so. Yanovsky stepped down from the Fraye Arbeter Shtime editorship in 1919 after siding against Lenin in debate over the Bolshevik Revolution. By this point, anarchism had begun another decline that, this time, would not rebound. Post-World War I deportations and the Russian Revolution pulled workers to Russia and Communism, and there were fewer recruits, between immigration restrictions and the aging out of older anarchists, whose children had assimilated into American society. Fraye Arbeter Shtime subscriptions declined and the paper returned to its former, dire straits. No editorial committee was at the helm. A new Jewish anarchist federation, formed in 1921, organized social events and raised money from across the continent to reestablish stability for the paper by the mid-1920s. Joseph Cohen succeeded Yanovksy as editor in 1923. The paper retained its same quality of journalism and remained a major source on American and international anarchist movements. The paper shortly ran an English-language section for readers unaccustomed to Yiddish. They also ran special supplements, jubilee issues, and English-language books and pamphlets by Nettlau and Berkman. Extracts of what would become anarchist Berkman's The ABC of Anarchism were originally published in the newspaper. Cohen founded the Michigan Sunrise Colony in 1932, leaving the Fraye Arbeter Shtime to a committee of Yanovsky, Frumkin, and Michael Cohn. Between 1934 and 1940, psychoanalyst and polyglot Mark Mratchny edited the paper. He covered the Spanish Civil War with exceptional interest but crushed upon the Republicans' defeat, left both the paper and the anarchist movement. The Jewish anarchist movement grew more conciliatory by the 1930s and less revolutionary. The paper kept good relations with other socialist Jewish unions, who also subscribed, helped to fundraise, and advertised during major labor holidays. Over time, the Jewish ghettos and some of their hopes for revolution faded. Readership continued to decline, and Fraye Arbeter Shtime went from weekly to fortnightly to monthly. By the 1970s, its circulation dropped below 2000. The paper passed through several editors: Herman Frank, Solo Linder, and Isidore Wisotsky. In 1975, the printer Ahrne Thorne became editor and curated the paper once again into a position of standing in the Yiddish world, with articles on topics including economics, international affairs, labor, and literature. But these gains were short-lived. As the Yiddish-speaking population grew gray, many Jewish anarchist organizations dissolved. Fraye Arbeter Shtime held its last annual banquet in mid-1977 and published its last paper in December. After 87 years, Fraye Arbeter Shtime was among the world's longest running anarchist journals and was the last foreign-language anarchist paper in the United States. By the time of its last issue in December 1977, Fraye Arbeter Shtime was the oldest Yiddish newspaper worldwide. Historian Paul Avrich described the group as both playing a vital role in Jewish‚ÄìAmerican labor history and upholding a high literary standard, having published the most lauded writers and poets in Yiddish radicalism. With Fraye Arbeter Shtime went the Jewish anarchist movement in America. Pacific Street Films' 1980 documentary Free Voice of Labor: The Jewish Anarchists covers the paper's last year of publication.

Its original description is limited and in 2008 it was argued that it is insufficient for recognizing it, making the name a nomen dubium. Instead the authors described three Southern Australian species in 2008: C. kynthia, C. southcotti and C. wurlerra. In 2010, this was disputed in a review of all Chrysaora species, which noted that C. pentastoma has a unique colour pattern that is described in its original description from 1810 and this is sufficient for recognizing it, making C. southcotti its junior synonym. C. kynthia from southwestern Australia and C. wurlerra from New South Wales were described in 2008 based mainly on colour, their tentacles and details of their gonad shape, but these can be variable in Chrysaora. As a result, they were tentatively considered as nomina dubia in 2010 (however, Chrysaora of southwestern Australia and New South Wales were not assigned to other species).

Early years Ruggles was born in the state of Ohio. He was a carpenter by trade and also a school teacher. Upon the outbreak of the American Civil War, he joined the Ohio State Militia where he was commissioned with the rank of Colonel. The militia was absorbed by the Department of the Ohio, an administrative military district created by the United States War Department early in the American Civil War, and assigned to the regular Union Army during the conflict. He served in the militia until 1866. That same year he was appointed to serve as an Indian Agent in the United States Territory of Arizona. As an agent he had to interact with the Native-American tribes of the Pimas, Papago (an archaic term for Tohono O'odham people) and Maricopa on behalf of the U.S. government. Ruggles, who was married to Cynthia M. Tharp, held that office until 1869.The Levi Ruggles Papers Florence, Arizona The area where Ruggles served had been once inhabited by the Hohokam people approximately 1,200 years ago. These early natives resided in close proximity to the Gila River, and had developed extensive canals and agricultural lands which yielded various crops. It is unknown what eventfully happened to the Hohokam people. During the early 1800s the region was under Mexican jurisdiction until the Gadsden Purchase of 1853, which placed all lands south of the Gila River under the authority of the United States Government.Open Repository Ruggles recognized the agricultural potential of the valley and found an easily fordable crossing on the Gila River. Ruggles brought land and surveyed a townsite which was laid out in 125 square foot blocks. He had a daughter named Florence, however it is commonly believed by historians that he named the town after Florence, Italy. Governor R.C. McCormick, helped secure a post office in August 1869. The first mail arrived in September, 1869, on horseback from the Blue River Station, twenty- five miles distant on the Overland Stage road. That same year (1869), he built his first family home and established a general store. The ruins of his first house are currently located in Ruggles St. between Quartz and Willow Streets.\\"CHAPTER III.

The wood for the building was brought from northern Arizona by wagon. The structure is located at W. 24 Ruggle St. It served as a courthouse. Since then, it has functioned as a hospital, health center, home for the elderly, and a museum.

It is located in Gjermundnes in the municipality of Vestnes. The museum was originally a large farm (storg√•rd, in contrast to a sm√•bruk 'small farm' or husmannsplass 'leased farm') and later on an agricultural school. The former Romsdal County (Romsdalen amt) purchased the Gjermundnes Farm 1898. A new facility was built in 1908 to meet the special requirements for the newly established agricultural school. That building had become dilapidated by 1972, and it was decided to demolish it when new construction was completed. However, with financial support from the county executive board, the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage, and the municipality of Vestnes, the old facility was renovated and converted into an agricultural museum. The M√∏re og Romsdal Agricultural Museum was officially opened on August 8, 1981 in conjunction with celebrations marking the centennial of the agricultural school, directed by the M√∏re og Romsdal agricultural company. In 2009 the museum became part of the Sunnm√∏re Museum Foundation. The museum is located in a building from the old agricultural school. It is a natural stop between √Ölesund and √Öndalsnes, just south of Molde, with panoramic views of the Romsdal Fjord and Molde. The museum barn contains new exhibitions from 2013 presenting the hard life of a fjord farm in M√∏re og Romsdal a hundred years ago. The area around the museum is located in a park with an avenue of oak trees dating from 1758, where there is also an Iron Age burial site. The exhibitions in the former dormitory cover the agricultural school's history at Gjermundnes, with student rooms restored to their conditions in 1960 and 1918.

It has a single tubular leaf and up to thirty five scented flowers with yellowish-green or purplish markings and is mainly confined to New South Wales. Description Prasophyllum beatrix is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped, dark green leaf up to long and wide at the base, with the free part up to long. Between eight and thirty five scented white flowers with yellowish-green or purplish markings are crowded along a robust flowering spike long. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is lance- shaped to narrow egg-shaped, long. The lateral sepals are a similar size to the dorsal sepal and are usually free each other. The petals are linear to lance-shaped and long. The labellum is white, long, turns upwards at more than 90¬∞ and has crinkled edges. Flowering occurs from September to October. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum beatrix was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones and Dean Rouse from a specimen collected from the Buckingbong State Forest near Narrandera and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (beatrix) is a Latin word beatusmeaning \\"she that makes happy\\", referring to \\"the pleasant feelings engendered when finding this species in its natural habitat'.

Edelman is the first Orthodox Jew to compete in the Winter Olympics, and the first Orthodox Jewish male to compete in either Olympic iteration. Edelman is currently a bobsled athlete training for the 2022 Beijing Olympic Games and program General Manager for the Israel Bobsled team.  Education and personal life  Edelman was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and grew up in Brookline, Massachusetts. He was raised in a Zionist, Modern Orthodox home by parents Cheryl (a lawyer) and Elazer Edelman (a biomedical engineer, physician, professor, and inventor). He is the middle of three boys. His elder brother is comedian and television writer Alex Edelman. Edelman graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2014 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. He was a member of the MIT Men's hockey team and a staff editorial columnist for the MIT newspaper, the Tech. MIT President Rafael Reif's 2018 commencement address used Edelman's Olympic journey as a basis of his message to the graduating class. Edelman is a dual American-Israeli citizen. He is an MBA candidate at the Yale School of Management. Edelman is nicknamed the \\"Hebrew Hammer,\\" a reference to the title character in the 2003 American comedy film The Hebrew Hammer. Edelman is an outspoken supporter of anti-bullying and mental health initiatives. He has said his motivation for continuing in sport is largely a desire \\"to use my Olympic journey as a platform to promote further Jewish and Israeli involvement in sport.\\"  Sports career = Hockey = Edelman's first sport was ice hockey, which he began playing at age three, as a goaltender. He continued to play hockey through high school for the Brookline Warriors hockey team and at MIT, where he was the program's first ever sabbath observant player. Edelman helped the MIT Engineers win two divisional championships in the Northeast Collegiate Hockey Association (NECHA) Division II league. = Bodybuilding = Edelman competed as an NGA accredited bodybuilder, placing in a top-3 medal finish at the 2014 NGA Annapolis Bodybuilding Championships. = Olympic sliding sports = Skeleton  Edelman tried skeleton for the first time at the Olympic facilities in Lake Placid, NY in March, 2014 where he was given an assessment that he was \\"not equipped for [skeleton]\\" and would \\"never be truly competitive.\\" The Israeli team was similarly told that Edelman would \\"get down the track but that‚Äôll be the most of it.\\" Nevertheless, Edelman set out a goal of qualifying for the 2022 Olympics. In his first race at the 2014 North American Cup, Edelman finished 18.64 seconds behind the race winner, and after hearing another athlete indicate that given his poor performance Edelman would quit within 2 years, decided to focus on making the 2018 Olympics, rather than 2022. In the 2018 Olympic qualification season, Edelman had cut this deficit to 1.19 seconds, placing ninth. In 2016, he decided to quit the sport and return to work, but changed his mind at the last minute and decided to train full-time, resigning from his job as a product manager at Oracle. Lacking funds, Edelman could not afford a coach and was self-taught. He reinforced his learning of the sport by watching nearly 12 hours of YouTube video daily. Edelman entered the final days of 2018 Olympic qualification outside of qualification position, needing 2 medal performances in the Lake Placid North American Cup races to jump up the ranking table. He secured Israel's first sliding sport Olympic berth by medaling in both races. Edelman competed for Israel at the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, finishing in 28th place. Edelman competed in two World Championships for Israel, and retired from skeleton as Israel's most decorated slider, winning four Israeli national titles and two medals in IBSF-sanctioned international competition.  Bobsled  Post-skeleton he has dedicated his efforts to qualifying an Israeli Bobsled team for the 2022 Beijing Olympics. In April, 2020, Edelman founded, has managed, and competes as part of an initiative called Operation Medal '26. OM26 seeks to capture Israel's first ever Winter Olympic medal at the 2026 Winter Olympics, and to qualify Israel's first ever Olympic Bobsled team at the 2022 Olympic Games.

Georgia, 585 U.S. ___ (2018), was a United States Supreme Court case. It is an original jurisdiction case in a long-running dispute over waters within the ACF River Basin, running from the north Georgia mountains through metro Atlanta to the Florida panhandle, which is managed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Waters in the area have been stressed by the population growth of Atlanta over previous decades. The immediate case stemmed from droughts in 2011 and 2012 that caused economic damage to Florida due to lower water flows from the ACF River Basin into the panhandle, impacting its seafood production; Florida sought relief to have more water allocated towards them from the ACF by placing a water allocation cap on Georgia. The Supreme Court assigned a special master to review Florida's complaint, but ultimately found in 2016 that Florida had not fully demonstrated the need for more allocation. Florida challenged this determination to the Supreme Court. On June 27, 2018, the Supreme Court ruled 5‚Äì4 that the special master had not properly considered Florida's argument and remanded the case to be reheard and reviewed. Background The case involves the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee- Flint (ACF) River Basin, which includes three major rivers in the southeast United States. The Chattahoochee River runs from the southern end of the Appalachian Mountains in northern Georgia and runs south-southwest and towards the Gulf of Mexico; it forms the state border between Georgia and Alabama. The Flint River forms from groundwater seepage in northern Georgia, and also runs south-southwest until it meets with the Chattahoochee at the southern edge of both Georgia and Alabama. The combined rivers become the Apalachicola River which then crosses Florida's panhandle and empties into Apalachicola Bay, an estuary abutting the Gulf. Besides serving as water sources for various municipal water systems, the ACF River Basin also provides significant quantities of water for agricultural irrigation, and numerous wildlife species reside along the rivers, particularly within the Bay. With approval from Congress, the United States Army Corps of Engineers completed Buford Dam on the Chattahoochee in Georgia in the 1950s that created the reservoir Lake Lanier. This was intended to help manage the water flow along the Chattahoochee so that it could be used for both hydroelectric power and for water-bourne transport through a series of locks, as well as for flood control. In the second half of the 20th century, Atlanta saw a significant boost in population growth, stressing its water supply that was also coupled with droughts. The Corps, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the state of Georgia, and the Atlanta Regional Commission conducted a study in 1989 to determine that to meet Atlanta's water needs in the future, the city could be offered the right to purchase some of the water stored in Lake Lanier as long as the city and state paid for the costs of constructing and operating the offtake from the lake to metro Atlanta. The Corps determined that there was no significant environmental impact of this approach. =Prior litigation= In 1990, Alabama filed a lawsuit to stop the Corps from implementing this plan, and other suits followed from Georgia and Florida. These suits were ultimately combined into a signal case designed to examine two questions: whether the Corps had the authority to grant water usage rights, and whether the plan ignored elements of the Endangered Species Act of 1973. By 1992, the parties had come to a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that would stay the lawsuit, with the Corps holding off on implementing their water supply plan with Atlanta, while a comprehensive water usage study of both the ACF and the neighboring Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa (ACT) River Basin was conducted. The MOU also included allowance for the Corps to provide reasonable quantities water to the metro Atlanta area to meet their needs while the study was in progress. By 1997, the study had yet to be completed, but Congress ratified two interstate compacts, the ACF and the ACT Compact, which allowed the involved states to enter into negotiations to derives formulas for how the water was to be allocated from these two basins. As with the 1992 MOU, the ACF Compact allowed the Corps to continue to provide water to the metro Atlanta area as it saw needed while the negotiations progressed. The states attempted to reach an agreement in the compact, but by 2003, these negotiations for the ACF Compact had failed, and 2004 for the ACT Compact, and both compacts were dissolved. Alabama restarted its 1990 lawsuit following the dissolution of the ACF Compact. This ended up splintering into eight different cases at state and federal level, but were ultimately condensed into two cases. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled in 2011 that the Corps did have the right to allocate waters from Lake Lanier to Atlanta, as Congress had authorized this use in the legislation used to approve of the project. Within the year, the Corps made a preliminary decision that it could offer 705 million gallons per day from Lanier to Atlanta to be added to its Master Manual for the ACF Basin, but that decision was pending an environmental impact statement. Alabama petitioned the case to the Supreme Court but they declined to hear the challenge, effectively ending decades of litigation. Case history In 2011 and 2012, droughts in the southeast states led to lower water levels in the ACF rivers, increasing the salinity of the waters in Apalachicola Bay, and caused a collapse of Florida's oyster industry. In 2013, Florida filed a motion for leave with the Supreme Court, issuing a complaint for equitable apportionment and injunctive relief against the state of Georgia. Florida claimed that the increased offtake of water by Georgia had caused \\"serious harm\\" to the ecosystem, and demanded that Atlanta cap its water offtake from the Chattahoochee to the 1992 levels (at the time of the MOU). The Court accepted the motion, and assigned Ralph I. Lancaster, Jr. as a special master to review the complaint. Lancaster performed discovery and pre-trial hearings from 2014 to 2016, and held a six-week trial in late 2016. He provided the Court with his report in February 2017, rejecting Florida's complaint towards Georgia. Lancaster had agreed that there was environmental impact from lower water levels, he stated that Florida had ‚Äúnot proven by clear and convincing evidence\\" that a water offtake cap would improve water availability during drought periods. Additionally, as Florida had not included the Army Corps within its complaint, they could not seek the required relief. In May 2017, the Corps updated its Master Manual to include the Atlanta water usage, with notice that should the Supreme Court issue a ruling in the case, they would update the Manual appropriately. Based on this new information, Florida filed their exceptions to Lancaster's report, specifically taking objection that they had to show clear evidence that capping Atlanta's water support would provide the redress they requested.  At the Supreme Court  Oral arguments took place on January 8, 2018. The Court issued its ruling on June 27, 2018. In a 5‚Äì4 decision, the Court found that the Special Master used too strict a standard to the case presented by Florida, and ordered the case be remanded to be reheard to take appropriate considerations for Florida's arguments. Subsequent actions Following the ruling, on August 9, 2018, the Supreme Court discharged Special Master Lancaster with the thanks of the court and replaced him with Judge Paul Joseph Kelly Jr. of the Tenth Circuit. Kelly discussed if the case needed additional discovery with the parties, but all agreed that the current documented history of the case should be sufficient, so Kelly, by January 2019, sought final statements and conclusions from the parties to review, with responses and counter-statements made by March 2019. In December 2019, the special master found in favor of Georgia. In his 96-page report to the Supreme Court, Kelly recommended denying Florida's request for a decree allocating the water between the two states. He found that Florida failed to show that Georgia's use of water was excessive or that the harm to their domestic oyster industry was caused by Georgia's activity. He also found that the benefit to Florida would not outweigh the harm to Georgia under the doctrine of equitable apportionment.

Moten is professor of performance studies at New York University and has taught previously at University of California, Riverside, Duke University, Brown University, and the University of Iowa. His scholarly texts include The Undercommons: Fugitive Planning & Black Study which was co-authored with Stefano Harney, In the Break: The Aesthetics of the Black Radical Tradition, and The Universal Machine (Duke University Press, 2018). He has published numerous poetry collections, including The Little Edges, The Feel Trio, B Jenkins, and Hughson‚Äôs Tavern. In 2020, Moten was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship for \\"[c]reating new conceptual spaces to accommodate emerging forms of Black aesthetics, cultural production, and social life.\\" Biography Fred Moten was born in Las Vegas in 1962 and was raised in the segregated black neighborhood on the western end of the city. His parents were among the black families that made up the Great Migration, the period in US history when many black families moved from the deep south to seek out new prospects in the northern and western parts of the country. His parents were originally from Louisiana and Arkansas and after resettling in Las Vegas, his father found employment at the Las Vegas Convention Center (and later worked for Pan American Airlines), and his mother worked as a grade school teacher. Moten enrolled in Harvard University in 1980 hoping to pursue a degree in economics. His interest in sociopolitical discourse, the work of Noam Chomsky, civic outreach, and political activism led him away from his studies. At the end of his first year, Moten was required to take a year leave. During this time, he worked as a janitor at the Nevada Test Site, wrote poetry, and discovered the works of T.S. Eliot and Joseph Conrad, among many others. His return to Harvard was more successful and led to developing his understanding of prose and finding more inspiration for his own work. It was also during this time that he met his collaborator-to-be Stefano Harney. After graduating from Harvard, Moten went on to pursue his PhD at University of California, Berkeley. Critical work Moten makes considerable intellectual contributions to the discourses of black studies, poetry and poetics, critical race theory and contemporary American literature. He has been profiled by Harvard Magazine, The Brooklyn Rail, and LitHub.com about his life and work in scholarship. In 2016, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship and the Stephen E. Henderson Award for Outstanding Achievement in Poetry by the African American Literature and Culture Society. Moten's work The Feel Trio (2014), named after Cecil Taylor's trio with William Parker and Tony Oxley, was awarded the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, and was a poetry finalist for the National Book Award. He also received a Foundation for Contemporary Arts Roy Lichtenstein Award (2018). He has served on numerous editorial boards including American Quarterly, Callaloo, Social Text, and Discourse. He has served on advisory boards for Issues in Critical Investigation at Vanderbilt University, the Critical Theory Institute at the University of California, Irvine, and was on the board of directors of the Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies at City University of New York.. As of September 2018, Moten is an associate professor in the Department of Performance Studies at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, where he teaches courses in Black studies, poetics, music and critical race theory. One of his most well-known works is a series of essays he published with Stefano Harney in a book called The Undercommons. Throughout these works he criticizes academia's drive to professionalize the student, logistical capitalism, debt‚Äìcredit hierarchies, and state-based institutions. He offers a theory of hapticality and to stay in debt to one another as a means of understanding one's own relationship to the world and to others.  Statements  \\"Black studies is a dehiscence at the heart of the institution on its edge; its broken, coded documents sanction walking in another world while passing through this one, graphically disordering the administered scarcity from which black studies flows as wealth.\\" Reflecting on his old neighborhood, Moten recalled: \\"I grew up around people who were weird. No one's blackness was compromised by their weirdness, and by the same token... nobody's weirdness was compromised by their blackness... In my mind I have this image of Sonny Boy Williamson wearing one of those harlequin suits he liked to wear. These dudes were strange, and I always felt that's just essential to black culture. George Clinton is weird. Anybody that we care about, that we still pay attention to, they were weird.\\" Works *The Universal Machine (series: Consent not to be a single being; Duke University Press, 2018) *Stolen Life (series: Consent not to be a single being; Duke University Press, 2018) *Black and Blur (series: Consent not to be a single being; Duke University Press, 2017) *The Service Porch (Letter Machine Editions, 2016) *A Poetics of the Undercommons (with Harney, Stefano; Sputnik and Fizzle, 2016) *Who touched me?

History The Association of Independent Information Professionals (AIIP) was founded in 1987 in the United States by a group of independent information professionals (then more commonly known as information brokers) led by Marilyn Levine, a professor of library and information science at the University of Wisconsin. As personal computers had become much more common, many librarians and entrepreneurs thought that independent information services were viable. Thus, Levine and 25 other information professionals met in Milwaukee in 1987 to make an association for networking and to support information entrepreneurs. AIIP adopted its Code of Ethical Business Practice in 1989, last revised in 2002. Membership Members are mostly solo practitioners and small business entrepreneurs who specialize in many different aspects of the information profession. Library schools, business schools, and business books list AIIP as a professional resource. Activities AIIP's activities include its webinars, virtual meetups, local events, a mentor program, the AIIP Connections blog, and a members-only e-mail discussion list. AIIP members use the AIIP Annual Conference to network and partner, learn about vendors, and hone information professional skills and business management. The AIIP 2019 Annual Conference happened 11‚Äì14 April 2019 in Philadelphia. The AIIP 2020 Annual Conference, scheduled for 23‚Äì26 April 2020 in Denver, was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

It is a monotypic genus containing a single species, Poralia rufescens. This jellyfish is pelagic, and is found in deep water in most of the world's oceans. Description Poralia rufescens has a bell about in diameter. It has 30 marginal tentacles interspersed with 15 rhopalia (sensory organs). The lappets (flaps) are rectangular in outline and are all the same length, the rhopalial lappets having deep clefts and the tentacular lappets shallow clefts. This jellyfish is very fragile and most specimens examined have been damaged. Distribution The distribution of this mesobathypelagic species is not well delineated. Before 1962, only eleven damaged specimens from the North Atlantic had been examined, mostly brought up from waters deeper than . It seems to be quite common in the vicinity of Bermuda and the Bahamas, mostly in the lowest of the water column. In a study of deep sea jellyfish in the Southern Ocean performed by the USNS Eltanin, the coronates Periphylla periphylla, Atolla wyvillei and Atolla chuni were the most common species found, comprising over 90% of the individuals sampled. P. rufescens was the most common semaeostome, making up 2% of the collection. A study using a remotely operated vehicle in deep water in the Japan Trench showed that P. rufescens was the most common scyphomedusan there. It has also been recorded from several locations in the eastern Pacific Ocean, including off the coast of southern California. Ecology The biology and ecology of the mesobathypelagic jellyfishes is poorly known. Their gelatinous bodies tend to have a low proportion of protein; P. rufescens has a protein content of 0.1% of the body dry weight as compared to an average of 4% for all gelatinous taxa. Some parts of the body have a higher nitrogenous content than others, and in the Pacific, leatherback sea turtles, whose diet consists largely of jellyfish, have been observed feeding on their gonads and tentacles, the parts which have the highest nutritional values.

John Augustus (jr.) succeeded his father as consulting chemist to the Royal Agricultural Society and continued research on soil fertility. He headed a committee that examined issues in Indian agriculture in 1891.  Early life and career  John was the second of five sons of Augustus Voelcker and born at Cirencester. After school he studied chemistry under Temple Orme before joining University College where his chemistry teacher was Professor Williamson. He was also a long distance runner and a member of the London Athletic Club. Voelcker then, like his father, studied chemistry in Giessen and received a doctorate for work on the composition of apatite and natural forms of calcium phosphate. He then returned to England to work with his father's laboratory. After the death of his father in 1884, he continued the experiments on the Woburn Experimental Station. One of the key findings at Woburn was the finding that sulphate of ammonia use in acidic soils led to the loss of soil nutrients by the leaching of calcium sulphate from the soil.  Indian agriculture  Voelcker's tour of India, 1890-91 In 1889, Voelcker was requested by the Secretary of State for India to examine improvements in Indian agriculture. He then spent a full year travelling around India and producing a 450-page report of recommendations. Voelcker's travels and enquiries led to his noting that Indian agriculture was highly varied across the country, defying generalization, and that some of the farming practices were as good as they could be. He called for a systematic study for the improvement of farming systems. The department of agriculture had been dissolved but Voelcker met a key person associated with it in the past, Hume. Hume had been highly critical of British policy in India. Voelcker also met Robert H. Elliot who was against artificial fertilizers. With regard to soil fertility, he noted that in areas where fuel was in short supply, that cattle manure was used for burning and not returned to the soil. He suggested that this could be ameliorated through the establishment of fuelwood plantations. It has been suggested that Voelcker's report was in many places a social critique, partly of imperialism. Following Voelcker's suggestion and in the face of impending famines, English chemist J. Walter Leather (1860-14 November 1934) was appointed agricultural chemist. Lord Curzon read the report and took various measures to re-establish a department of agriculture to coordinate policy across the country. Curzon appointed James W. Mollison from Bombay as the first Inspector General of Agriculture in 1901. For his contributions to Indian agriculture, Voelcker was made Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire in 1928. Personal life Voelcker was a devout Christian who attended the St. John's Presbyterian Church at Kensington. He married Alice Westgarth in 1884 and they had two sons and two daughters. The older son died young and the second died in the war. A mineral was named after him as Voelckerite but it was subsequently identified as being a form of fluorapatite.

Education Kakati graduated from the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun. She pursued her doctorate research on gibbons in Assam as part of the Wildlife Research Group, University of Cambridge. As part of her schooling she attend the Lawrence School Sanawar in the Simla Hills, India. Career Kakati's doctoral research was on the hoolock gibbons of Dehing Patkai Wildlife Sanctuary. While performing this research, she became curious about the predator tracks that she kept finding on the grounds of the lowlands. This interest led to her work with cats. In 2007-2009 Kakati and her team set up 30 digital camera traps in the Jeypore-Dehing lowland evergreen forests of Assam during which her team recorded seven species of cats and other rare forest animals. The research found 7 cat species in a 354-square- mile (570-square-kilometer) range‚Äîthe highest diversity of cat species yet photographed in a single area. In 2012-2015, she studied mammal occurrence in a forest and swidden agriculture matrix in the Balpakram area of Meghalaya state, India, documenting 51 species of mammals, among which were 5 species of cats. Kakati's research was supported by the Assam Forest Department and funded by the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF), the Wildlife Conservation Society‚ÄìIndia Program and the Rufford Small Grants Foundation, United Kingdom. Areas of work Kakati's area of work includes wildlife conservation, species diversity, biodiversity monitoring and animal ecology. In 2011, Kakati authored a report critical of Indian government plans to build a highway through a wildlife sanctuary. Two years later, it was still \\"the only known impact study\\" for this 99 km road project connecting India to Burma. In 2014, Kakati filed a petition seeking legal protection for the elephant corridors under the Environment Protection Act. She alleged that the state government allowed Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) to construct an oil dispatch terminal in the Golai elephant corridor in violation of environment laws. According to Kakati's petition, around 295 elephants use the two corridors to migrate from one end to the other of the reserved forest which is also home to over 40 species of mammals and 19 carnivores.

Until 1818 the rural character remained intact, but with industrial development a change to the working class community took place, in which agriculture was only a part-time occupation. Until the end of 1968 the town belonged to the Amt Ferndorf. On 1 January 1969, Fellinghausen was incorporated into the city of Kreuztal, which was created as part of the communal reorganization. A special feature in Fellinghausen is the historical Hauberg, which shows the form of traditional forest use in the Siegerland. In the project, the Forest Cooperative has undertaken to continue an area of about 24 hectares from its forest ownership in the old form of forest management (historical use of the Hauberg) in order to make a contribution to the preservation of tradition. Regular guided tours for school classes, clubs or private groups are conducted under the direction of the Waldgenossenschaft Fellinghausen in cooperation with the Forstamt Hilchenbach.

It is located in the province of Gauteng. It is situated west of the Johannesburg CBD. History Prior to the discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand in 1886, the suburb lay on farmland called Newlands that lay on the original farms called Waterval and Middlefontein. The suburb was established in May 1918 by the Johannesburg Town Council as an area for black residents and called it Newlands Location. The residents of Newlands objected to the name and during July 1919 its name was changed to Western Native Townships. It would undergo more name changes during Apartheid when it was declaimed as a black township on 2 January 1963 and proclaimed as the Western Coloured Township in July 1963 when forced removals were used to move coloured residents from Doornfontein and Pageview to this location. By 1967 it had its last name change when it became Westbury. Westbury is the first place black people could legally live in the City of Johannesburg. It was built on a municipal landfill that discouraged whites from purchasing land on the adjacent Sophiatown, forcing the owner Herman Tobiansky to sell land indiscriminately to members of any race.  Local events = 2018 protests = Protests were sparked by the death of Westbury resident, Heather Petersen, on 27 September 2018. She was caught in crossfire as she accompanied her 11 year old niece (daughter in some reports) to collect her school report. As one report explained > ‚ÄòThe fatal shooting was believed to be part of an ongoing war between rival > gangs, who were importing Cape Town hitmen to do their killing. ‚ÄúThey use > the local guys to point out who they want killed,‚Äù said a police officer, > who wished to remain anonymous. At stake was a lucrative drug trade that > includes Cat, cheap heroin, crack cocaine and pure cocaine.‚Äô Protests flared up the day after Petersen‚Äôs killing, with protestors vowing ‚Äòto shut down the area to mourn her death and [they] called on government to deploy the army to clean up the drug-ridden area‚Äô. Police fired rubber bullets at protestors, injuring one . The protests continued for several days, with protestors blocking roads and torching a bus station. On 2 October 2018, police minister Bheki Cele visited Westbury to engage with residents. On 4 October 2018 he launched a ‚Äòtactical task team‚Äô to investigate. On 5 October police arrested eight people for suspected gang-related crimes . On 10 October, two Sophiatown police officers were arrested on suspicion a corrupt relationship with criminals. On 14 October 2018 a man was arrested in the case of Heather Petersen‚Äôs murder. Prominent gangs in the area - the Fast Guns and Varados - have a significant influence on everyday life. In the context of material deprivation, gangs provide opportunities and services to people such as ‚Äòloans, paying for funerals, providing food and other welfare‚Äô . Meanwhile, turf wars had resulted in ‚Äò36 gang-related deaths in the past financial year and 33 in the current financial year‚Äô according to the police minister, Bheki Cele speaking in October 2018. Some estimates are higher; one activist, also speaking in October 2018, said that 900 people had been killed since 2014 . According to experts, the capacity of police to investigate gangs had been diminished as a result of restructuring. Party politics and racial identity shaped accounts of the situation. Some residents expressed the view that the government discriminates against, and has abandoned, coloureds.

He completed high school at Central Philippine University in 1980. Action against the Abu Sayyaf On 21 February 1993, members of a breakaway faction of the Moro National Liberation Front kidnapped Anthony Luis Biel, the 5-year-old grandson of a Basilan businessman. The following month on 18 March 1993, the Moro militants abducted a Spanish Claretian missionary priest, Bernardo Blanco as he drove to his parish church in Isabela, Basilan. Negotiations for Blanco's release bogged down as the Abu Sayyaf entered the scene and demanded ‚Ç±14 million as ransom. An operation aimed at rescuing the hostages spearheaded by the Philippine Marine Corps began on 3 May 1993. On 6 May 1993 Blanco managed to escape his captors. The Marines led by Parcon continued their push toward the militants' Camp Al-Madinah, where Abu Sayyaf fighters led by Isnilon Hapilon and allegedly Wahab Akbar engaged them in combat. Parcon's unit eventually killed 46 Abu Sayyaf militants and Biel was released.

It was opened in 2015 by Will Horowitz and his sister Julia Horowitz. The owners also opened a restaurant in Tribeca called Harry and Ida's Luncheonette. Harry and Ida's is named after their grandparents, who owned a delicatessen in Harlem. Their pastrami sandwich is considered one of the best in New York. It is served on a Pain d' Avignon club roll, instead of the tradition rye bread, with cracked rye berries, anchovy mustard, and buttermilk-fermented cucumber kraut. Their pastrami is brined with juniper berries and seasoned with coriander and black pepper before being smoked. Besides pastrami, they also serve a smoked eel sandwich (the live eels are butchered and smoked in-house), smoked bluefish and a smoked apricot chicken sandwich with green apple, red cabbage saurkraut, basil, and a charred poblano pepper sourcream seasoned with ras el hanout. They also have some vegetarian options including a \\"vegetarian chopped liver\\" sandwich made from mushroom-walnut puree and an amaranth quinoa and sorghum grain salad topped with coconut babaganoush and baked tofu.

Gulf of the Ganges (Bay of Bengal) left, Southeast Asian peninsula in the center, South China Sea right, with \\"Sinae\\" (China). The city known in English as Chittagong has undergone changes in both its official and popular names worldwide. The choice of names stems from the Chittagonian culture, language and colonisation. A reason for the city having a number of names is due to the diverse history of Chittagong and the Chittagonian language, which nearly has a 50% Arabic-origin vocabulary.http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Arabic Bengali and Chittagonian names The Bengali word for Chittagong, Chottogram (‡¶ö‡¶ü‡ßç‡¶ü‡¶ó‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶Æ), has the suffix \\"-gram\\" (‡¶ó‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶Æ) meaning village in Standard Bengali, and the word \\"chotto\\" could be from \\"chati\\" meaning lamp. A legend dates the name to the spread of Islam, when a Muslim lit a chati (lamp) at the top of a hill in the city and called out (Azaan) for people to come to prayer. Thus, many people continue to call the city, ‡¶ö‡¶æ‡¶ü‡¶ø‡¶ó‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶Æ (Chatigram) or in the Chittagonian language, ‡¶ö‡¶æ‡¶ü‡¶ø‡¶ó‡¶æ‡¶Å‡¶ì (Chatigaon), ‡¶ó‡¶æ‡¶Å‡¶ì (Gaon) meaning village. Other names include ‡¶ö‡¶æ‡¶ü‡¶ó‡¶æ‡¶Å (Chatga), ‡¶ö‡ßà‡¶ü‡ßç‡¶ü‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶≠‡ßÇ‡¶Æ‡¶ø (Chaityabhumi) and ‡¶ö‡¶ü‡ßç‡¶ü‡¶≤‡¶æ (Chottola). Names such as Chatagao are still used in Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi, Chittagonian and other Bengali dialects today. The name Sitagang is also common in Eastern dialects with \\"gang\\" also meaning village. Arabic names Arab traders saw well-developed currency, banking and shipping in Chittagong during the 9th century. Early cosmopolitan Muslims established dominance over the port as an entrepot of maritime trade.https://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/24/opinion/la-oe-kaplan-20101024 Geographically, the Ganges Delta is located in Bengal. The Arabic word Sha·π≠·π≠ (ÿ¥ÿ∑) meaning delta, could also be an etymology of Chittagong, the Ganges delta, Sha·π≠·π≠ Al-GhƒÅnj (ÿ¥ÿ∑ ÿßŸÑÿ∫ÿßŸÜÿ¨). The Moroccan traveller, Ibn Battuta referred to the Port of Chittagong as SadkƒÅwƒÅn (ÿ≥ÿØŸÉÿßŸàÿßŸÜ). However, currently the Arabic word for Chittagong is Shee·π≠aghungh (ÿ¥Ÿäÿ™ÿßÿ∫ŸàŸÜÿ∫). Burmese names Chittagong was an important port city in the Kingdom of Mrauk U, after Arakan's independence from the Bengal Sultanate. The Burmese tradition of the city's etymology, is that an Arakanese king, invading in the 9th century, gave the city the name Tsit-ta-gung (to make war is improper). Portuguese and Dutch names right The Portuguese referred to the port city as Porto Grande de Bengala, which meant \\"the Grand Harbor of Bengal\\". The term was often simplified as Porto Grande. Other names include Xatigan from the Dutch, Xetigam, and Chatig√£o from an early Bengali name. Historical names and nicknames Mughal period in 1702 The Mughal conquest of Chittagong re- established Bengali control and ushered an era of stability and trade. The city was renamed as Islamabad (City of Islam) and continues to be used in the old city. According to Roman historian Pliny the Elder, the Port of Chittagong is mentioned in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea as ‡¶ó‡¶ô‡ßç‡¶ó‡¶æ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶ú‡¶æ‡¶∞ (Gongabazaar) meaning \\"the Market of the Ganges\\". The location described is most likely located in Sitakunda, Sitakunda Upazila. In ancient Tibetan texts, the city was known as ‡¶ú‡ßç‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶≤‡¶®‡¶ß‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶æ (Jaalondhaara), and in Arab geographical texts as ‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶Æ‡¶®‡ßç‡¶¶‡¶∞ (Samandar).

They sometimes receive federal budgetary appropriations, but some also have independent sources of revenue. Federal-government-acquired corporations The federal-government-acquired corporations are a separate set of corporations that were originally chartered and created by an entity other than the U.S. federal government, but that were, at some point, nationalised by the federal government. Most of these are corporations temporarily in possession of the government as a result of a seizure of property of a debtor to the government, such as a delinquent taxpayer; usually, these are awaiting liquidation at auction, and most are too small to note. However, there are also corporations that the federal government has nationalised to ensure the continued provision of an essential service or services (such as the federal government's nationalisation of the Alaska Northern Railroad in 1914 and Tanana Valley Railroad in 1917, now both part of the Alaska Railroad, which remained federally-owned until being sold to the state of Alaska in 1985, and, on a larger scale, the nationalisation of all U.S. railroads from 1917 to 1920 under the United States Railroad Administration), as well as nationalization of the northeastern freight railroads under Conrail (1976).

The vast majority of non-governmental corporations in the United States are chartered by the states of the United States. This includes most charitable corporations, non-profit corporations, and for-profit corporations. States also have the power to charter corporations that they own, control, or are responsible for the regulation and finance of. These include municipal corporations and state chartered and owned corporations. State government-chartered and -owned corporations are numerous and provide public services. Examples include North Dakota Mill and Elevator and South Dakota Public Broadcasting. Generally speaking, a statute passed by a state legislature specifically sets up a government-owned company in order to undertake a specific public purpose with public funds or public property. Lotteries in the United States are also run by government corporations, such as the Georgia Lottery Corporation and many others. = Tribal and indigenous governments = There also exists a third level of sovereign government in the United States: the sovereignty of the Native American tribal governments. As such, the Native American (including Alaska Native) tribal governments have the power to charter corporations and undertake public undertakings that might benefit their tribal citizens, Native Americans being not only citizens of their particular tribes, but also citizens of their respective U.S. states, and of the United States. For example, a tribal council could establish a public service broadcaster along the lines of Ireland's Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann, partially fund it with a television license on tribal land, and make up the difference through advertising, thereby making it both a means of uniting the tribe and giving it a voice and a commercial venture by the tribe. The Alaska Natives are particularly advanced in using their tribal sovereignty to incorporate corporations that are owned by and for the benefit of their tribal citizens and often compete in highly competitive economic sectors through the Alaska Native Regional Corporations. The Native American tribes in the 48 contiguous states often use their sovereignty and their ability to charter to compete using regulatory easements; for instance, Native American tribal corporations often trade in goods that are highly taxed in surrounding states (such as tobacco), or engage in activities that surrounding states have (for reasons of public policy) forbidden, such as the operation of casinos or other gaming establishments. Most of these endeavors have proven very successful for Native American tribal sovereigns and their tribal corporations, bringing wealth into the hands of Native Americans.

Her scholarly work includes the writing of a comprehensive textbook on violence. In 2017, Lee attracted attention for organizing a conference at Yale on professional ethics surrounding the mental health of Donald Trump. She withheld her views at the conference but later prominently criticized the American Psychiatric Association for changing an ethical guideline called the Goldwater rule with the Trump presidency. In March 2017, the association had expanded the rule to restrict not just diagnosis but any comment on the mental health of public figures absent a personal examination, misleadingly calling it a \\"reaffirmation.\\" This change alarmed Lee and her colleagues enough to lead to her conference and, later, to co-authoring The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, a book of essays that warned against the dangers of Trump's mental instability. Early life and education Bandy Lee was born in 1970 and raised in the Bronx, New York. She is of Korean descent. Her mother was Inmyung Lee and her grandfather was Geun-Young Lee, a South Korean physician who she says inspired her with a belief that practicing medicine also involves social responsibility.

Formerly a shooting range used by the British Army, low-cost flats were constructed within the area to provide affordable housing for the urban poor.  Etymology  Rifle Range was so named as the area was once used as a shooting range by the British Army and local police.  History  Rifle Range, which was used by the military and the police as a shooting range during the British colonial era, was also the site where victims of the Imperial Japanese Army's Sook Ching massacres were buried. During World War II, when Penang was under Japanese occupation, thousands of ethnic Chinese were brutally executed by the Japanese authorities and were buried in mass graves throughout Penang, including at Rifle Range. The remains of the victims would only be uncovered in the 1960s, when the construction of the Rifle Range flats was underway. In 1964, the Malaysian federal government approved a pilot project to construct prefabricated high-rise housing at Rifle Range. Six blocks of 17-storey flats and three blocks of 18-storey flats, which cumulatively contain 3,699 residential units and 66 shop lots, were to be assembled on-site using prefabricated concrete blocks. The construction of the flats, Penang's first low-cost high-rise housing project, was undertaken by the Penang Development Corporation. The flats were completed in the 1970s.

It was influenced by the political writing of Mary Wollstonecraft and William Godwin. Life He was the son of Richard James Lawrence, a slave-owner of Fairfield, Jamaica, He was educated at Eton College, where he was Montem poet in 1790. He then studied in Germany, at the University of G√∂ttingen. Lawrence led an itinerant life, mainly in continental Europe. In 1803, in France with his father, he was arrested, along with other English residents and tourists, and was detained for several years at Verdun. He escaped by passing himself off as an Austrian. He received compensation for the Fairfield estate, under the Slave Compensation Act 1837. Lawrence died unmarried 26 September 1840, and was interred with his father in the burying- ground of St. John's Wood Chapel. He claimed to be a Knight of Malta, and was known as the Chevalier Lawrence. Works The \\"utopian romance\\" The Empire of the Nairs, Lawrence's major work, developed in stages. In 1793 he published in Der Teutsche Merkur an essay on the Nair castes of Malabar, examining their customs of marriage and inheritance. In 1800 Lawrence completed a novel on the topic, in German. It was published in the Journal der Romane the following year, as Das Paradies der Liebe, then reprinted as Das Reich der Nairen. The book was subsequently translated into French and English by the author, and published in both versions; the English translation, as The Empire of the Nairs (1811), was much modified from the original, and had an introduction advocating the customs.

Architectural design is associated with the theme of the modern industrial urban environment, characteristic of the station's location area. The architecture of the station was designed by architects N.V. Romashkin-Timanova and U. S. Sergeeva. The theme of architecture is revealed in the image of decorative lamps arranged on columns, stylized as \\"propellers.\\" Their bodies are made of stainless steel. Built-in fluorescent lamps shine upward with reflection. Lamps of round shape shine down and illuminate the platform. The floors of the vestibules and the station are made of polished granite. The columns are faced with stainless steel sheets, the walls are covered with ceramic panels with plinths of polished black granite. For the most complete disclosure of the architectural and artistic concept of the station on the side walls, artistic and decorative glass compositions designed in the scale of station finishing were designed. Art panels were made using the technology of lenticular printing (artist I.I. Baranova). For the safety of passengers, glazed fences with automatic sliding doors are installed along the edges of the platforms. The exit of passengers is carried out to the right side, as well as at the other metro stations with onshore platforms. The stations \\"Begovaya\\" and \\"Zenit\\" are connected by a double-track tunnel.

It has a single tubular, green leaf and up to thirty scented, light brown flowers with a whitish labellum. It is only known from 18 populations and the total population is estimated to number fewer than 500 plants. Description Prasophyllum secutum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped leaf which is long and wide near its purplish-red base. The free part of the leaf is long. Between nine and thirty scented, light brown flowers are arranged along a flowering spike which is long reaching to a height of . The flowers are long and wide. As with other leek orchids, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is lance- shaped to narrow egg-shaped, about long, wide. The lateral sepals are long, about wide, free from and parallel to each other. The petals are linear, long, about wide and turned forwards. The labellum is whitish, about long, wide and turns sharply upwards through about 90¬∞ near its middle. There is a fleshy green, channelled callus in the centre of the labellum and extending past the bend. The callus is covered with small papillae. Flowering occurs in October and November but only after fires the previous summer. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum secutum was first formally described in 1998 by David Jones from a specimen collected on Anthony Beach near Smithton and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (secutum) is a Latin word meaning \\"followed\\" referring to this species flowering more prolifically after fire. Distribution and habitat The northern leek orchid grows in dense coastal scrub between sand dunes. It is found in northern Tasmania and on some of the islands in Bass Strait. Conservation The total number of mature plants of P. secutum is difficult to estimate because they only flower after fire and many populations have not been observed for several decades. About 250 plants are known from two populations and the total number in all populations is estimated to be about 500. The main threats to the species are land clearing, habitat disturbance, inappropriate fire regimes and small population size.

It is the oldest preserved town hall in Sweden. History and architecture The town hall is the oldest surviving town hall in Sweden. It was built during the 15th and 16th centuries. It is located on R√•dhustorget, the oldest square of Vadstena which derives its name from the town hall. The square itself is mentioned in written sources for the first time in the early 15th century, and the construction of the town hall started after Vadstena was granted town privileges by Queen Margaret. The building comprises three distinct parts: the actual town hall, facing east; a tower; and a northern wing. The oldest part is the part facing east. Its construction date is referred to as 1490 in several sources; however, dendrochronological examination of a wooden beam in the building has concluded that the wood was felled before 1454‚Äì55. Possible explanations may be that older wood was re- used when building the town hall, or that the town hall was substantially rebuilt after a fire which destroyed much of Vadstena in 1487. The tower of the town hall is presumed to have been built at the beginning of the 16th century, and reflects a Northern German fashion of adorning town halls with an impressive tower. The spire and lantern of the tower dates from 1691 and replaced earlier crow-stepped gables. In its present appearance, the northern wing of the town hall dates from 1728, when it replaced an earlier annex dating from 1567. In connection with this, the whole town hall was rebuilt and acquired the appearance it still largely has. Later alterations include changes made to the roof in 1776 and again in the 19th century, and refurbishments carried out in 1915, 1958 and 1962. In connection with the installation of public toilets on the square in front of the town hall, an archaeological examination was carried out in 2014. The town hall was the seat of the local government until the 1970s, but lost its jurisdiction and function as a town court in 1948. Today it is occasionally used for art exhibitions and also houses a restaurant. The tower of the town hall at one point contained the town jail, and historical records also note that the town executioner lived in a building adjacent to the town hall.

By the 14th century, this castle was in disrepair and it was demolished and rebuilt as a stone keep around 1397 by Sir William Bagot. Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, was imprisoned at Baginton Castle following his son Harry Hotspur's defeat at the Battle of Shrewsbury on 21 July 1403. This castle was in disrepair by the 16th century, as it was described by John Leland in 1540 as 'desolate'.

At the end of November 1981, a strong high-pressure anticyclone over southern England was keeping temperatures around the average for the time of year. Numerous strong low- pressure extratropical cyclones passing to the north of Scotland dragged cold upper-level air down from the Arctic, but the anticyclone to the south of the United Kingdom deflected the coldest air away from the British Isles. On 23 November 1981, a cold front crossing the United Kingdom, fuelled by humid subtropical air from the south colliding with this colder Arctic air from the north, spawned 104 tornadoes as part of a record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak. Following the passing of the cold front, the anticyclone to the south began to break down, allowing the colder Arctic air to move in over the British Isles from the north and precipitating the start of the severe cold wave at the start of December.

It premiered at the Royal Court Theatre in London in November 2009 and centres around John, a gay man who feels torn after meeting and falling in love with a woman. Plot John has identified as \\"gay\\" his entire life and has been in a relationship with his boyfriend \\"M\\" for the last 7 years, with whom he shares an apartment and a family life. After the couple decide to take a break, John meets a woman named \\"W\\" on his daily commute. He is surprised to find himself developing a physical attraction to her and decides to lose his heterosexual virginity and have sex with a woman for the first time. After identifying as a gay man for many years, John discovers that he enjoys sex with women. He now feels torn between his longtime boyfriend and his new female lover, as the newly discovered joys of vaginal sex cause his sexual identity as a gay man to be thrown into confusion. As \\"W\\" teaches John the ins-and-outs of heterosexual intercourse, the relationship becomes more serious and they began to consider getting married and having children together. Eventually, he confesses that he has slept with a woman, causing his boyfriend to be offended by the infidelity and disgusted that John has been cheating with a woman. John tells M that he loves him, but that sex is better with W (\\"her vagina is amazing\\") and that she's a more fitting partner for him (\\"She's better than you\\"). The play's final scene, which is meant to be reminiscent of a cock fight, features John's boyfriend and John's girlfriend fighting over who will have him. Production history The play premiered at the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs, London, in November 2009, with Ben Whishaw as John, Andrew Scott as M, Katherine Parkinson as W and Paul Jesson as F; the original cast were recorded for a radio production broadcast on BBC Radio 3 in November 2011.Drama On 3 - Cock, BBC web page accessed 27 June 2020. A production of the play was also put on at the Duke On 42nd Street, in New York City, in 2012. The first major revival in the UK was commissioned by Chichester Festival Theatre in 2018 and played in the Minerva Theatre, directed by Kate Hewitt. Reception Michael Billington of The Guardian gave the play 3 stars out of 5, praising the play as a \\"sharp, witty study\\" that was less about \\"tortured bisexuality\\" and more about the \\"paralysing indecision that stems from not knowing who one really is.\\" However, he notes that the play lacks social detail and character depth. Alison Croggon, writing in The Guardian, gave the play 2 stars out of 5, described Cock as a story of a gay man's discovery of \\"the unexpected pleasures of Cunt.\\" She criticizes the play's \\"uncomfortable subtext of misogyny\\" and describes the plot as \\"farcical\\". In The Village Voice, Alexis Solokis describes the play as a \\"visceral, funny, anguished\\" production that \\"pits boy against girl, cock against cunt.\\" She likens the final dinner scene to a gladiator's ring or a boxing round that ends up being \\"less a battle of the sexes than a battle of sexual orientation.\\" Writing for the Sydney Arts Guide, Richard Cotter described the play as a \\"robust, ribald and bollocking production\\" about a gay man who becomes \\"cock shocked and cunt struck\\" due to a \\"newfound fondness for vaginal sex and a future view of breeding fecundity\\". He praised Bartlett's \\"crisp script\\" which he felt perfectly describes the sexual confusion of a \\"man child who has his cock and wants to eat it too.\\" Cotter notes the sizzling tension between the female lover and the cuckolded boyfriend, which leads to the play's \\"shattering climax\\". Gay City News credited the play for \\"tackling thorny issues rarely seen on stage\\". Instead of the standard coming out narrative of the supposedly straight man \\"succumbing to the power of cock, there's a supposedly gay guy with a boyfriend falling for pussy\\", a theme that is handled by Bartlett's script with \\"sensitivity and acerbic wit.\\" The play is critiqued as \\"gimmicky\\", but the \\"surprisingly steamy\\" and \\"brilliantly staged\\" sex scene is praised for eliciting nervous laughter and shocked reactions in the audience. The Lifestyle Hub described the play as \\"a gay man's hilarious journey to heterosexual orgasm\\" that explores the \\"complexities of homosexuality.\\" The play's \\"honest\\" and \\"straightforward\\" exploration of bisexuality shows that \\"Gay or not, people fall in love to those who can give us happiness.\\" By presenting the story of a \\"bisexual gay\\" man who develops an attraction to the opposite sex, the play demonstrates the truth that \\"for some gays, they yearn for that happiness with other people regardless if they have vagina or... cock.\\" Mark Robins of Vancouver Presents has described the play as an exploration of identity and sexual fluidity that might appeal to a younger demographic, calling the play an \\"intellectual exercise on modern-day sexuality.\\" The play won an Olivier award in 2010 for an Outstanding Achievement in an Affiliate Theatre.Olivier Winners 2010, Official London Theatre site, accessed 27 June 2020.

Early life and education He was born at Morrison's Court, 108 Argyle Street, Glasgow, Scotland on 21 February 1838, the third child of Alexander Kerr and Helen Shanks; he was brother of Norman Kerr. His father Alexander was a merchant and ship owner who lived at Florentine Bank House, Hillhead, and who died in 1855 leaving instructions in his will that \\"my children receive a liberal or what might be termed a first rate education.\\" However, his children did not come into their full inheritance until they were 25.

Alexander Kerr was engaged by the Board in London in 1872, initially on a three-year contract. He was recommended by his previous employer, the Oriental Banking Corporation, and Lord Dufferin. He had also worked for the London & Victoria Bank.Letter from the archivist, The National Bank of New Zealand. 10 Aug 1992 Postcard dated 1908 sent to Mrs Kerr showing Thames Street, Oamaru, with the National Bank and Bank of New South Wales. In April 1875 he was appointed manager of the Nelson branch, which had opened in October 1873. He remained at Nelson until February 1877 when he was transferred as manager of the Oamaru branch. He stayed at Oamaru until he resigned from the National Bank in December 1881. He was a member of the Wellington Philosophical Society and active in local charities, such as the Nelson Aid Society, the Caledonian Society of Nelson, Management Committee of the Nelson Hospital, and the Oamaru Hospital Committee. He evidently was a success as manager, as noted by the Colonist newspaper in 1877 when it was reported that Mr Kerr was moving to Oamaru from Nelson. \\"It is an unusual thing for one in his position to acquire so much esteem as he has gained in the short time that he has been amongst us. During his eighteen month &c.;, in the administration of which he has taken on his residence in Nelson, Mr Kerr has proved himself a cautious banker and a useful citizen, and several of our local charities, active part, will miss him much, and from the opinions we hear expressed the clients of the Bank, who have benefited by his council and matured advice, will especially regret his removal.\\" One of his duties as manager in Oamaru seems to have been pigeon shooting, as reported by the local paper. \\"At the meeting of Municipal Council last evening, Mr Alex Kerr, manager of the local branch of the National Bank, by letter applied for permission to shoot the pigeons that infest the bank building to the manifest annoyance of the public. The writer stated that he had tried every other method of getting rid of them that he could think of, but without success.\\" On his retirement the North Otago Times reported in 1881 \\"Mr Kerr has been over twenty years in the banking business; during quite five of those years he has resided in Oamaru, and while here he has, both as a bank manager and as a private gentleman, been held in high estimation. As might be expected in connection with the retirement of a man of Mr Kerr's bonhomie from a position which he has long held approbation, it is proposed to present him with a public testimonial in recognition of his merits and to mark the closing of his banking career. It is Mr Kerr's intention to enter into business in Oamaru, and many besides us will wish him what he deserves - all possible success in his new sphere.\\" He was then in business, General Stores and Insurance, operating from the Colonial Bank of New Zealand Buildings in Oamaru, until about September 1883. =England= Alexander returned to Europe, where he lived in Kensington, London, and in Paris, at 18 rue du Pr√©- aux-Clercs, Faubourg St Germain.

Louis-Philippe, roi des Fran√ßais de 1830 √† 1848, 1841, par Franz Xaver Winterhalter.  Historical context  Until the French Revolution, Spanish art was seldom shown or known in France. it appeared at the Louvre with the Napoleonic Wars and the looting politics of Vivant Denon. However, stolen art pieces were given back by France after the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815). Louis Philippe decided in 1835 to found a Spanish painting gallery in the Louvre. He had several motivations: * He wanted to rebuild contacts with the Spanish branch of the Bourbon dynasty (the relationship with the Spanish branch had been degraded by the Napoleonic Wars), and therefore put himself in the context of the European Royal families to legitimize his new power, * He also wanted to use the Spanish paintings as a model to renovate French painting, away from the current Neoclassicism of the times.  Creation of the Gallery  Beginning in 1810, French occupation and repression in Spain made it highly unstable. The secularization of religious orders facilitated the selling of their art pieces outside of the Spanish territory. In 1835, he founded an \\"artistic mission\\" directed by Baron Isidore Taylor, which was in charge of constituting quickly a vast collection of Spanish paintings. Taylor acquired a huge collection of hundreds of paintings from primitive paintings to the Spanish Golden Age. Many of the paintings he acquired were unknown from the public because they came from religious collections. The \\"Spanish Gallery\\" opened to the public on 7 January 1838, accompanied by a lot of Royal marketing and publicity. Louis Philippe stressed the point that the collection was acquired on his own founds. The collection counted for example 81 Zurbaran, 39 Murillo, 28 Ribera, 23 Cano, and 19 Vel√°zquez. Many paintings attracted the admiration of the public. However, the collection, which counted 450 paintings, was criticized for its inconsistency. Taylor sent \\"en masse\\" the paintings, without any preliminary selection, and nobody in the Louvre had the required expertise to operate this selection. Masters as Murillo and Zurbaran were shown alongside much smaller artists.  Dispersion and influence  Le Christ en croix ador√© par deux donateurs, from El Greco. After the death of Louis Philippe, the collection was dismantled in London, from 6 to 8 May 1853, during an auction in Christie's. Only one painting was forgotten in the reserves and remained in the Louvre (The deploration of Christ by Jaume Huguet). One of the painting came back later to the Louvre in 1908: \\"Le Christ en croix ador√© par deux donateurs\\" from El Greco, bought from the Prades town for 25000 francs. Nowadays only these two paintings from the initial collection are shown in the Louvre. This collection was seen by many artists and intellectuals of the time and influenced them. √âdouard Manet wrote to Charles Baudelaire, concerning Velazquez, in a letter from the 14 September 1865: \\"he is the greatest painter of all times.

It contained information regarding his invention of the \\"Art of Double Writing\\", especially a claim for patent rights. It did not contain any information on what his invention exactly was. William Petty was educated in France and in Holland, and returned to England in 1646, to finish his education in the medical science at Oxford University. He was quite active in many fields of scientific discovery and inventions and developed an instrument for double-writing in 1647. It is mentioned in his first printed publication, titled The Advice to Hartlib (1647). Petty went to Ireland in 1652 to assist Oliver Cromwell in his conquest and arranged the Down Survey, a cadastral survey of Ireland, between 1654 and 1656. It would take twelve years, until Petty's next publication appeared in print: the Proceedings between Sankey and Petty. In 1662 Petty was one of the founding members of the Royal Society.  Bibliographical information  6 p. full title: A Declaration Concerning the newly invented Art of Double Writing. Wherein are expressed the reasons of the Authors proceedings in procuring a Priviledge for the same : As also of the Time, Manner, and Price, of the discovery of the said Art, and of the Instruments belonging thereunto. For the satisfaction of all that desire to be partakers of the great benefit of the same, before they adventure anything towards the reward thereof. Whereunto is annexed a copie of an Ordinance of both Houses of Parliament, approving the feasibility and great use of the said invention, and allowing a Priviledge to the Inventor, for the sole benefit thereof for 14 years, upon the penalty of one hundred pounds. Already in the Preface of his first printed publication, The Advice to Hartlib (first published 1647), Petty had written that there was \\"invented an Instrument of small Bulke and price, easily made, and very durable, whereby any Man, even at the first sight and handling, may write two resembling Copies of the same thing at once, as serviceably and as fast (allowing two lines upon each page for setting the Instruments) as by the ordinary way.\\" He then suggested that the returns of that invention might perhaps be enough to pay for the \\"Ergastula literaria\\" ‚Äì the literary work-houses ‚Äì that he wanted to establish. Apart from the six page pamphlet on \\"Double Writing\\", published early in 1648, in April 1648 Petty also published a single leafed broadside, titled Double Writing,Keynes 1971: nr. 3; Wings: P 1921; ESTC: R210729.

Already early in 1603, a Bavarian Jesuit priest, Christoph Scheiner (1573-1650) had invented a pantograph, a mechanical instrument, in which a pencil was connected to a stylus by means of a parallelogram. The pantograph was intended to create a copy of an image. Scheiner's invention was described in his Pantographice seu Ars delineandi res quaslibet per parallelogrammum lineare seu cavum (1631).Scheiner 1631: . For Scheiner's pantograph see also (1990) ‚Äì The Science of Art. (Part II: Machine and Mind), p. 180f. Although it is sometimes thought that the invention was a kind of typewriter, the most probable explanation is that it was some kind of jointed or flexible framework for handwriting with two pens at once.17th century typewriters. Connor (2014) - 'Technological Object: Polygraph,' on website of Literature Technology Media (LTM) Research Group at University of Cambridge, Faculty of English; accessed 2018-01-11 (the same in: this page). states that the invention of Petty was an adaptation of the pantograph of Scheiner. The Hartlib Papers hold an anonymous and undated copy of a text about \\"the nature and uses of the double writing instrument\\".The nature & uses of the double writing Instrument. On 22 December 1647 William Petty sent a petition to the House of Lords, asking for a patent right. The petition contains a certificate that Petty was able to produce two copies of the first chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews in 15 minutes.. See also: Memo & Testimonial on Double Writing dated 1647-12-22. The patent was passed on 6 March 1648 \\"under the Great Seal (‚Ä¶) for Seventeen Years\\"., \\"Proceedings in Parliament: February 28th - April 1st, 1648\\", in Historical Collections of Private Passages of State: Volume 7, 1647-48 (London, 1721), pp. 1010-1045. in British History Online (accessed 23 September 2017). Samuel Hartlib called Petty's invention the Instrumentum Pettii.In a letter from Hartlib to Robert Boyle of 10 augustus 1658. See The Works of the Honourable Robert Boyle etc.; see also Fitzmaurice 1895, pp. 10/11, 13. Petty dedicated his 'instrument' to Robert Boyle.  Contents  In Double Writing not a word is said about the invention itself. Petty first explains that he thinks it is unnecessary to enlarge upon the importance of his invention. He next explains in broad terms how he has come to ask a patent on it. And finally he describes how much the use of the instrument will cost. The last page of the document holds an ordinance of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, dated 6 March 1647, which affirms the claim of a patent, \\"for the term of 14 yeares\\".See also: , \\"Proceedings in Parliament: February 28th - April 1st, 1648\\", in Historical Collections of Private Passages of State: Volume 7, 1647-48 (London, 1721), pp. 1010-1045. in British History Online (accessed 2018-01-10; the heading of chapter XXIV also has \\"1647\\"). The text of 6 March reads as follows: \\"The House (of Commons) was informed of one Mr. Petty, who hath found out an Art of Double Writing, to write Two Copies at once, and that he desired a Patent for Teaching of the same, under the Great Seal of England for certain Years; and the House hereupon Ordered, That a Patent should pass under the Great Seal to the said Mr. Petty for Seventeen Years, to teach his Art of double Writing.\\"  Critical reception  Petty's activities in the field of inventions are often mentioned by later scholars. But concerning his instrument for double writing in general not much is added to the little, that is known about it from the Double Writing pamphlet. Fitzmaurice mentions Petty's collaboration with a John Holland of Deptford for three years. This partnership was to be confined to the development of Petty's inventions, \\"more particularly the double writing instrument, a machine for printing several columns at once, a scheme for making a great bridge without any support on the river over which it stands, and other undertakings of the same kind.\\" Fitzmaurice did not find any record of what the partnership effected. William PooleW. Poole (2017?) - 'Seventeenth-Century ‚ÄòDouble Writing‚Äô Schemes, and a 1676 Letter in the Phonetic Script and Real Character of John Wilkins.' To be published in the Notes and Records of the Royal Society. See: ORA-record, with a link to a downloadable pdf (access-date 2018-01-21). places the Double Writing instrument of Petty in the context of a broader interest in building devices for double writing in the 17th century, especially in the 1650s. He claims to unravel the complex history of proposals for such instruments for the first time.  Wren's Instrument for Double Writing  A couple of years later Christopher Wren also referred to a double writing machine in a letter.Wren's Parentalia (London 1750), p. 215. Wren complained that a model of his own invention, in a still imperfect condition, had been seen by chance by someone, who had reproduced it. The failure of the reproduction of his unfinished invention had made it impossible for him to give to the world his own perfected instrument for multiplying copies of writing. Wren does not mention a name, but the history of Petty's invention leads Bevan \\"to suspect that he may have been the person whom Wren accuses of this dishonorable act. From what we know of Petty's insensibility to strict honesty, where he saw any chance of furthering his own interests, we cannot say that he was incapable of such an action.\\"Bevan 1894, p. 23/4.

Its motto in Greek, from an Olympian Ode by Pindar, was Water is best. This led to the members being called Hypocrites, due to the fact that beer, wine and spirits were the chosen drinks. Origins The Hypocrites Club was founded in 1921 by John Davies Knatchbull Lloyd, nicknamed the \\"Widow\\" after the shaving lotion \\"The Widow Lloyd's Euxesis\\". Wanting to avoid dining in hall, Lloyd and his friends got together to raise the money necessary to rent two large rooms and a kitchen over a bicycle shop, formerly a medieval house, at 31 St Aldate's (other source said 34 or 131). The rooms were reached through a narrow staircase. They also paid for the part-time services of a cook and a servant-cum-barman. After Evelyn Waugh was introduced to the club by Terence Lucy Greenidge, many of his contemporary fellow students followed soon and the club started to change. From a place to discuss philosophy it became a place to drink and party. As Waugh remembered later it was a \\"process of invasion and occupation by a group of wanton Etonians who brought it to speedy dissolution\\". Waugh's excess drinking life habit started with the club, \\"It was at the university that I took to drink, discovering in a crude way the contrasting pleasures of intoxication and discrimination. On the two, for many years, I preferred the former.\\" A servant at the club would say: \\"They call themselves an artists‚Äô club but all they draw is corks!\\" Members William Lygon, 8th Earl Beauchamp was the president of the club and Waugh was the secretary. Members included: Hugh Lygon; William Howard, 8th Earl of Wicklow; Anthony Powell; Graham Pollard; Harold Acton; Robert Byron; Alfred Duggan; Mark Ogilvie-Grant; Arden Hilliard; Gavin Henderson, 2nd Baron Faringdon; David Plunket Greene; Terence Lucy Greenidge; Raoul Loveday; Alastair Hugh Graham; E. E. Evans- Pritchard; Roger Hollis; Claud Cockburn; Anthony Bushell; Brian Howard; Tom Driberg; Christopher Hollis; Alastair Hugh Graham; H. D. Ziman. =Harold Acton= Talking about Harold Acton and the club, Emlyn Williams in his autobiography George (1961) said: \\"He's the Oxford aesthete, [...] he belongs to the Hypocrites' Club with Brian Howard and Robert Byron and Evelyn Waugh.\\" =Robert Byron= Robert Byron, who was the resident entertainer singing Victorian music hall, joined because it provided him a haven for like-minded \\"aesthetes.\\" =Alfred Duggan= Alfred Duggan joined the club to continue to drink after the pubs and bars had closed. He introduced Anthony Powell to the Club during Powell's first week in residence; while Powell was hardly able to finish a pint of the club's potent dark beer, Duggan drank a tankard of burgundy, his usual lunch-time tipple. Duggan was in his second year at Balliol College and was the son of an alcoholic, on the way to becoming one himself. =Tom Driberg= Evelyn Waugh introduced Tom Driberg to the club. Driberg remembered \\"dancing with John F., while Evelyn and another rolled on a sofa with (as one of them said later) their 'tongues licking each other's tonsils'.\\" =Alastair Hugh Graham= Alastair Hugh Graham Alastair Hugh Graham followed Richard Pares as Waugh's friend of heart. Waugh called him Hamish Lennox in his writings, and said that \\"[he] had no repugnance to the bottle and we drank deep together. At times he was as gay as any Hypocrite, but there were always hints of the spirit that in later years has made him a recluse.\\" Graham sent Waugh a naked photo of himself, leaning against a rock face, with arms outstretched, buttocks in full view, and with the text explaining the best way to drink wine: \\"You must tab a peach and peel it, and put it in a finger bowl, and pour the Burgundy over. The flavour is exquisite. With love from Alastair and his poor dead heart.\\" =Arden Hilliard= Arden Hilliard, first from the left Arden Hilliard was born in 1904, the son of Edward Hilliard, Bursar of Balliol College, Oxford, and Kathleen Margaret Alexander Arden (1877-1939). He had three sisters, Heather Evelyn (b. 1899), Barbara Joyce (b. 1902), and Margaret Lilian Kathleen (b. 1907). In 1939 his mother Kathleen Hilliard committed suicide jumping from the roof of a private nursing home where she was treated for mental illness. Hilliard was an undergraduate at Balliol College with Anthony Powell, Matthew Ponsonby, Peter Quennell and Pierse Synnott. He was in particular friend of Ponsonby. In his autobiography To Keep the Ball Rolling, Powell, wrote of Hilliard: \\"[He] had come up to Oxford from Winchester, with a Balliol Exhibition, and an unmanageable burden of good looks. Handsome, nice mannered, mild in demeanour, Hilliard, at first meeting, conveyed not the smallest suggestion of his capacity for falling into trouble. The variety of ways in which he got on the wrong side of the authorities during his period of residence (prematurely cut short) was both contrarious and phenomenal. He was one of the nicest of men, in certain moods content to live a quiet even humdrum existence; at other times behaving with a minimum of discretion, altogether disregarding the traditional recommendation that, if you can't be good, be careful. [...] A vignette that remains in my mind of this early Balliol period is of being woken up one night to find Hilliard and Ponsonby standing by my bedside. Without a word, one of them held out a brimming glass of sparkling burgundy. I drained it, equally in silence.\\" Later, on 19 September 1982, reading the obituary of John Edward Bowle, Powell remembered how at Oxford he always avoided him; Hilliard and Ponsonby instead engaged with Bowle, shortly after dropping him when his bad temper came out. In 1926 Hilliard undertook a trip to Corsica with Anthony Powell, just graduated from Balliol College; on the way back in Nice they met Hugh Lygon who was staying at W. Somerset Maugham's villa. Hilliard then took up farming. During World War II Hilliard became a captain of infantry. He was Mentioned in dispatches on 15 April 1941 in the Supplement of The London Gazette. After World War II, according to Powell, he took \\"an erratically charted course that had something of Jude the Obscure in reverse; erstwhile scholar who transformed himself into a rustic swain.\\" Hilliard moved to Sussex and became the area secretary of the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals. Hilliard died on 30 August 1976. At the time of his death he was living at Sinnock Square, High Street, Hastings, Sussex.The London Gazette (20 January 1977). \\"Notices Under the Trustee Act, p. 906. Retrieved 28 February 2018. =Christopher Hollis= Christopher Hollis wrote in his memoirs, Along the Road to Frome, that \\"the two centres of my social life that remain most vividly in my mind are the Hypocrites' Club and Offal luncheons. The Hypocrites' Club was founded by a number of those who liked the less conventional ways, in refuge from the regular dining clubs such as the Gridiron or Vincent's, which were both too expensive and, in our opinion, too starchy. It consisted of a number of bare, uncarpeted rooms in a couple of houses beyond Christ Church and just short of Folly Bridge.\\" =Brian Howard= At Oxford, Brian Howard and his friends were known as Hearts, mostly sons of noblemen and aspiring writers. The Isis Magazine wrote \\"They are rather alarming. They have succeeded in picking up a whole series of intellectual catch-phrases with which they proceed to dazzle their friends and frighten their acquaintances: and they are the only people I have ever met who have reduced rudeness to a fine art.\\" Sir John Betjeman tells the story of a Balliol aesthete called Michael Dugdale who used to walk into Brasenose College, dominated by the Hearts, with a stick and limping, in the hope that the Hearts would be too sporting to attack him. =Hugh Lygon= Hugh Lygon, the third love-interest of Waugh at Oxford, was as hard-drinking and self- destructive as Waugh and Graham. Lygon moved round Oxford like a lost boy. Terence Lucy Greenidge remembered him carrying a teddy bear. Greenidge, while admiring Hugh's classical good looks, charm and elegance, said he was \\"rather empty.\\" Lygon, along with Robert Byron, Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross and Brian Howard, was one of the most sexually active of the Hypocrites. After Waugh published A Little Learning, Harold Acton wrote to him complaining he had revealed his homosexuality, while omitting Byron's, Balfour's, Howard's and Lygon's promiscuities. Tamara Talbot Rice, one of the few women undergraduates at Oxford, remembered how John Fothergill let Waugh have rooms in the Spreadeagle at Thame at a special midweek rate so that he and Lygon could meet in private. =Anthony Powell= Anthony Powell wrote: \\"Coming from different colleges, we used to lunch or dine several times a week at this inexpensive and ill-furnished club over a bicycle shop near Folly Bridge. The premises, reputed to be Tudor, were certainly very rickety. The membership, equally irregular, was in process of changing from shove-halfpenny playing Bohemians to fancy-dress wearing aesthetes. One of the rowdiest members was Evelyn Waugh, one of the most sophisticated Harold Acton.\\" =E.E. Evans- Pritchard= E. E. Evans-Pritchard lived an aesthetic and bohemian life, a reaction to the horrors of World War I. As an undergraduate he was a member of the Hypocrites Club. There is a photograph of Evans-Pritchard at a fancy-dress party in which he is in Arab dress looking like T. E. Lawrence. Evans- Pritchard later became an anthropologist. =Evelyn Waugh= Anthony Powell's first encounter with Evelyn Waugh was a sighting of him at the Hypocrites sitting on the knee of another member, Christopher Hollis. Waugh later teased Christopher Sykes for not having had a homosexual phase. Though Waugh was friends with Terence Lucy Greenidge and Harold Acton, eccentrics and crazy, romantically he was attracted to fragile, beautiful boys like Alastair Hugh Graham and Richard Pares. After Waugh left Oxford he kept going back, and on 12 November 1924 he accepted a lunch date with John Sutro, that was indeed a surprise party at which Sutro invited all of Waugh's \\"old friends\\": Harold Acton, Mark Ogilvie-Grant, Hugh Lygon, Robert Byron, Arden Hilliard and Richard Pares. That night Waugh got into Balliol and was let out of a window for having mocked Hilliard and Powell. It was to this visit that Waugh later attributed his \\"decline\\" into alcohol. =H. D. Ziman= H. D. Ziman became the Literary Editor of the Daily Telegraph and was in his fourth year when he met Anthony Powell, a freshman. It was Ziman who later put in contact Powell with American publisher Ken Giniger, who wanted to produce a picture-book of Powell's book, A Dance to the Music of Time. Elements of the club=Harrow School= Many who joined the club were previously students at Harrow School. John Betjeman recalled that \\"whenever the police raided the Hypocrites' Club or the Coconut Club, the '43 or the Blue Lantern there would always be Harrovians there.\\" =Homosexuality= Some of the members of the club, like Brian Howard were gay, but most were not. But in any case there was a notice on the wall saying \\"Gentlemen may prance but not dance.\\" At the time undergraduate students were forbidden to drink in pubs and homosexuality was illegal, therefore clubs like the Hypocrites' were places to do both in a safe environment. Waugh would remember that the club became \\"notorious not only for drunkenness but for flamboyance of dress and manner which was in some cases patently homosexual\\". The \\"gay set\\" of the Hypocrites' Club listed Arden Hilliard, Hugh Lygon, Harold Acton, Mark Ogilvie-Grant, John \\"The Widow\\" Lloyd, Robert Byron, and Gavin Henderson. =Railway Club= Railway Club at Oxford. Left to right, back: Henry Yorke, Roy Harrod, Henry Weymouth, David Plunket Greene, Harry Stavordale, Brian Howard. Middle row: Michael Rosse, John Sutro, Hugh Lygon, Harold Acton, Bryan Guinness, Patrick Balfour, Mark Ogilvie-Grant, Johnny Drury-Lowe; front: porters. A contemporary club at Oxford was the Railway Club, founded by John Sutro and dominated by Harold Acton; members included: Henry Yorke; Roy Harrod; Henry Thynne, 6th Marquess of Bath; David Plunket Greene; Edward Henry Charles James Fox-Strangways, 7th Earl of Ilchester; Brian Howard; Michael Parsons, 6th Earl of Rosse; Hugh Lygon; Bryan Guinness, 2nd Baron Moyne; Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross; Mark Ogilvie-Grant; John Drury-Lowe; Evelyn Waugh. The members of the Railway Club dined in black-tie aboard of the Penzance-Aberdeen express between Oxford and Leicester. =The Scarlet Woman= The Scarlet Woman: An Ecclesiastical Melodrama was directed by Terence Lucy Greenidge, and written by Evelyn Waugh in September 1924.Scarlet Woman: An Ecclesiastical Melodrama . The cast members were: the same Evelyn Waugh, Arden Hilliard, Elsa Lanchester, John Greenidge (Terence's brother), Alec Waugh, John Sutro, the same Terence Greenidge, Septimus Nixon (real name Guy Hemingway), Derek Erskine, Michael Murgatroyd (real name William Lygon, 8th Earl Beauchamp), Archibald Gordon and Sibbald Malcolm. The absurd plot was about the Pope (Guy Hemingway) trying to convert England to Catholicism using Sligger (the Dean of Balliol, Evelyn Waugh). Greenidge, his brother John, Waugh and Sutro put 5 pounds (¬£ in sterlings) each and bought a camera. Filming mostly took place in Arthur Waugh's garden at Hampstead with few other locations in London and Oxford. Most of the actors came from the Hypocrites' Club, other than Waugh's brother, Alec, and Elsa Lanchester, not yet a professional actress and managing a night club in Charlotte Street, London. Her pay was a ¬£4 dinner. The Scarlet Woman is Evelyn Waugh's only movie and was never shown in public; it had private screenings in London and Oxford. Christopher Sykes says it \\"became a legend rather than an experience\\" for most of Waugh's friends. Father C. C. Martindale of Campion Hall, a Catholic house in the University of Oxford, saw it and \\"laughed till his tears flowed\\". Closure The club's mischief began to be noticed by the Oxford authorities when William Howard, 8th Earl of Wicklow, gave a supper party on the roof of a church. In March 1924, Robert Byron and Harold Acton were forbidden by the university authorities to enact an 1840 Exhibition event. The Victorian fancy dress party was hosted at the club as a protest. The club was finally closed down in May 1925 by the dean of Balliol College, Oxford, \\"Sligger\\" Urquhart after a party where members dressed as nuns and choirboys and painted their lips vermillion. It's interesting to notice that another source states that Robert Byron and The Widow Lloyd gave a Victorian party where men dressed in feminine apparel and Arden Hilliard masqueraded as a nun. That night Hilliard went through the gate of Balliol in his nun costume. Hilliard was promptly dismissed by Balliol. Translation: For example, another of my friends, Arden Hilliard, made a provocatorial act crossing the imposing portal of Balliol disguised as a nun to go to the costume ball of the club of Hypocrites. He was promptly dismissed. Waugh's revenge for the closure of the Club was to enter Balliol late at night and shout in the quad, \\"The Dean of Balliol sleeps with men!\\". Balliol College and the Hypocrites' Club were the epicentres of what James Lees-Milne called \\"that scintillating generation... a mixture of the socially sophisticated and the enviably gifted... notably Twentyish and also alarming.\\" The premises of the club were then rented by former member David Plunket Greene, attending Oxford with his brother Richard Plunket Greene. Robert Byron's biographer James Knox described them as a \\"wildly irresponsible pair who had never experienced any form of parental control.\\" Just before Alastair Hugh Graham left England to become an honorary attach√© in Athens in 1927, revisited the club location with Waugh, but Waugh \\"hated 31 St. Aldate's for its discomfort and its associations\\". Later however, in his autobiography, Waugh would write that the club had been the \\"source of friendships still warm today.\\" The Hypocrites Club's premises are now social housing. Aftermath In 1936, Major Guy Richard Charles Wyndham (1896 - 19 May 1948), who wrote the autobiographical novel The Gentle Savage under the name of Richard Wyndham, issued invitations to a \\"remarkable\\" dinner that reads: \\"To Welcome Home Aginejok. Richard Wyndham invites you to a Dinka Dinner to be held in the Bahr-el-Ghazal Room, Savoy Hotel, at 8.0 p.m. on September 2nd. It is hoped that after-dinner speakers will stand on one leg.\\" Aginejok was the native name for the friendly district commissioner who had been his host in the Sudan. Among the invited guests many were former Hypocrites or friends of them. They were: Tom Driberg, Montague Shearman, Hon. David Tennant, R. J. Brock, Arden Hilliard, E. A. Boyce, St John Hutchinson, K.C., Ralph Keene, Peter Quennell, John Heygate, Sacheverell Sitwell, Curtis Moffat, Freddy Mayor, Desmond Flower, 10th Viscount Ashbrook, Hon. Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross, Major W. R. Barker, Capt. J. S. Poole, Capt. F. O. Cave, and A. J. A. Symons. The dinner was so remarkable that is remembered in at least two memoirs: Tom Driberg: his life and indiscretions and A. J. A. Symons: His Life and Speculations. Legacy The members of the club became the main inspiration of Waugh's novel Brideshead Revisited.

Raised in Australia and trained as a moral philosopher on topics of drug addiction, Foddy was a bassist in the electronic group Cut Copy and a hobbyist game designer while he finished his dissertation. During his postdoctoral research at Princeton University and time on staff at Oxford University, Foddy developed games of very high difficulty including QWOP (2008), which became an Internet sensation at the end of 2010 with the rise of new online social sharing tools. He later became an instructor at the NYU Game Center. His most famous game aside from QWOP is Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy, a philosophical, physics-based platformer video game released in the year 2017.  Early life and career  Bennett Foddy was raised in Australia. His parents were academics. He studied philosophy in college and was working as a research assistant in the field when his childhood friend, Dan Whitford, started the Australian electronic group Cut Copy. Whitford was the sole writer for the first album but reached out to friends to expand the band. Foddy played bass, despite having little experience. When his duties to the band conflicted with his philosophy studies, he chose the latter. Foddy enrolled in a doctoral degree in philosophy in late 2003 at the University of Melbourne with an interest in cognitive science and human addiction and left Cut Copy in 2004. He also said that the touring life of waiting and partying did not fit his personality. Foddy has said that his best design work happened while he was procrastinating from other work. He taught himself to program and design games in 2006 from online tutorials while working on his philosophy dissertation. In his first Flash game, Too Many Ninjas (2007), the player defended their immobile ninja avatar against oncoming ninjas. The game mainly relies on reflexes and a small set of buttons. Its positive press encouraged Foddy to continue the pursuit, but Foddy hid this hobby from his colleagues to avoid the philosophy field's stigma against philosophers who do not wholly dedicate themselves to their philosophy work. QWOP title refers to the four keyboard keys used to move the muscles of the sprinter avatar He moved to the United States as a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University from 2007 to 2010. Foddy wrote philosophy papers and lectured on topics of drug addiction. Meanwhile, he developed another simple game, QWOP, for release in 2008, in which the player uses the four keyboard keys of the game's title to control the muscles of an Olympic sprinter. It was a modest success at release, but became an Internet sensation and one of his most recognizable titles following its popularization on burgeoning websites Stumbleupon, Reddit, and YouTube in late 2010. QWOP enjoyed attention uncommon for indie games of its size. Kill Screen included the title in its 2011 Museum of Modern Art event and it appeared on the American television show The Office in 2012. As his postdoctoral work ended, Foddy's game design career outshined his philosophy career with the help of QWOP, but before he came to choose the former, Foddy served as the deputy director of Oxford University's Institute for Science and Ethics. Foddy did not intend for QWOP to connect with his philosophy work, but he saw similarities between his use of reward‚Äìpunishment cycles and the motivations behind addiction. For a time, he also worked on ascertaining the existence of game addiction and considered the intrinsic values of in-game rewards. Foddy later came to describe his game design aspirations as \\"literary\\", building atop a lineage of predecessors. In content, QWOP is based on the 1980s arcade game Track & Field. Foddy's childhood gaming experiences became touchstones for the themes he would develop in QWOP and which would recur throughout his next titles. Foddy sought to recreate the vexing difficulty of games from his youth and the range of emotions they pique. He also wanted to create the \\"immediacy\\" of direct-to-TV video game appliances, which lacked the software load times characteristic of console games. Though several of his games prominently feature rhythm, it was not a consideration in his design. Bennett Foddy's Speed Chess, a 16-player chess deathmatch, debuted at NYU Game Center's 2013 No Quarter exhibition In Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy, the player-character ascends a mountain using only a hammer GDC Independent Games Festival Nuovo Award His next game, GIRP (2011), is a rock climbing simulator in which the player presses keyboard keys assigned to rocks on a wall to flex and ascend its surface. Wired described the free game as \\"masochistically difficult\\", with the effect of making the player's keyboard similar to the physical skill game of Twister, in which the player grips the keyboard like the avatar grips the rock face. Like QWOP, both titles have awkward controls that push the player to embody the avatar once the controls are internalized. GIRP is designed for players to set their own goals, such as their own maximum height, or once they reach the top, their own fastest score, rather than publicly comparing against an online leaderboard. As New York University expanded its Game Center into Brooklyn in late 2013, Foddy taught his first studio class in game design. A colleague highlighted Foddy's expertise on \\"game feel\\": his use of in-game physics to create tension. Foddy created many other small games, including a 16-player chess deathmatch (Bennett Foddy's Speed Chess, 2013) and a maze of optical illusions (Zebra, 2016). Foddy also expressed an interest in games history, particularly the English and European games not widely known in the United States. In 2014, his Indiecade presentation linked older, independently developed video games into the historical lineage of indie game development as it was contemporaneously known. In 2016, Foddy co-developed Multibowl, a competitive minigame compilation of scenes from 1980s and 90s video games. Similar to the microgames of WarioWare, Foddy presents two-player, 30-second challenge scenarios culled from 230 commercial games, with a point awarded to the player who first completes the scenario's objective. Foddy was spurred by his interest in video game history and the accessibility of video game emulators. He privileged original titles in his selections. The game exhibited at XOXO and Fantastic Arcade, and will not receive a public release to avoid legal issues. Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy released in late 2017. The player is tasked with scaling a mountain as a man stuck inside a cauldron using only a hammer. Wired described the game as both \\"uproariously, darkly funny\\" and \\"challenging to the point of impossibility\\". Foddy narrates the title on the topic of failure. The game was popular with video game streamers and nominated for the Independent Games Festival's top prize.  Personal life  Foddy is married. His wife designs hats.

Centre-Half had been a problem position for Derby County in 1888-1889 and various players were tried. J Smith had become the regular centre-half but he missed/was unavailable for the Boxing Day match against Bolton Wanderers. Smith again was unavailable, this time for the visit of Wolverhampton Wanderers on 12 January.

The book was edited by her colleagues at the University of Groningen, including Wander Lowie. Among the contributors there are Ronald Langacker, Diane Larsen-Freeman, Luke Harding and Kees de Bot. The book was planned to be presented to her at the AILA conference in Groningen. However, the conference was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Works Verspoor has published articles in journals such as Applied Linguistics, Journal of Second Language Writing, The Modern Language Journal, Language Teaching Research, and Language Learning. In 2004 she wrote a seminal article along with de Bot and Lowie on second language development, in which she applied the dynamic systems theory to study second language writing development. This was the first research paper in which time-series data were used to explicate changes in the development of second language writing. In 2015 Verspoor presented A dynamic perspective on developmental patterns in Finnish as an L2 at the ELC 4. Fourth International Postgraduate Conference on Language and Cognition at the University of Vigo. In 2017 Verspoor's first article was published in which she and her colleagues applied the Hidden Markov Model to simulate language development. She is also noted for her work on language complexity. She proposed the finite verb ratio index to measure general syntactic complexity and the average word length of content words to gauge lexical complexity in second language writing development.
