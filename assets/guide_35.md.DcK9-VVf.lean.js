Life  = Early life = Jeffrey Glassberg was born in Brooklyn, New York, on November 27, 1947, where his family lived until 1952 when they moved to Long Island, New York. His father established his own company making automobile seat covers and his mother worked there as well. Glassberg's early years were devoted to nature; bird-watching, chasing butterflies, and, with his younger brother, to chemistry experimentation. Moving from the buildings of New York City to a place of forests and meadows on Long Island where his parents allowed him to roam stimulated his interest and love of nature which continues. = Family life = Jeffrey Glassberg met his future wife, Jane Scott, in a seminar course on bacteriophage lambda at Rice University. When he moved to Stanford University School of Medicine in 1972, she accompanied him and was a post- doctoral fellow at the University of California, San Francisco. In 1979 they both moved to Rockefeller University, where she worked on virology in the laboratory of Purnell W. Choppin.  Education and academic career  Glassberg graduated from Tufts University School of Engineering with a degree in civil engineering in 1969, but turned to biology after travels to South America with a colleague to study butterflies. He took summer biology courses and taught high school biology on the North Shore of Long Island, before acceptance into the graduate program at Rice University, Houston, Texas, in 1972. Glassberg received his PhD in biology from Rice University in 1977, working on the genetics of bacteriophage SP01 DNA replication in the laboratory of Charlie Stewart.Glassberg, J.; Slomiany, R.A.; Stewart, C.R.

DNA Profiling (DNA Fingerprinting)  Glassberg continued his scientific work as one of the founders of ACTAGEN (an acronym for advanced clinical testing and genetics) in March 1982. This company, renamed as Lifecodes played a major role in the early period of DNA fingerprinting. This included providing the test cases for the first court trials in the United States as well as the first training of F.B.I. personnel in DNA forensics. One of the first F.B.I. scientists trained was Bruce Budowle, a Senior Scientist, who initially headed the F.B.I.‚Äôs effort in this area and who later became the Executive Director of the Institute of Applied Genetics at the Univ. of North Texas health Science Center, Ft. Worth, Texas. Glassberg is the inventor on the patent \\"Method for forensic analysis\\" (US 5593832 A), with a priority date of February 28, 1983.

Return to Education  Following his work with DNA fingerprinting, Glassberg went to Columbia Law School, graduating in 1993 with his Doctor of Jurisprudence (J.D.) . He is an adjunct faculty member at Rice University in the department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology Graduate Program Faculty .  Conservation with butterflies  In November 1992, Glassberg founded the North American Butterfly Association to engage the public in the support of conservation. As president he has been a driving force behind NABA's growth, including the founding of the National Butterfly Center in southern Texas.  Field guides  He is the author of seven butterfly field guides that use photographs of live butterflies, in addition to initiating and editing a field guide to dragonflies and one to wildflowers. Glassberg was the first to write a butterfly field guide intended for readers to identify butterflies using binoculars. \\"His new book, Butterflies Through Binoculars: A Field Guide to Butterflies in the Boston-New York-Washington Region, published this year by Oxford University Press, is the first to focus on netless butterflying.\\" \\"His own Butterflies through Binoculars, published in 1993, is credited with revolutionizing the pursuit of butterflies with its emphasis on observation in the field\\".Nicole Arthur. Washington Post \\"Wings of Desire\\". The Burlington Free Press. July 6, 2000. p. C1. In 1999, Robert Robbins, then chair of the Department of Entomology at the Smithsonian Institution‚Äôs National Museum of Natural History, stated that \\"Glassberg‚Äôs butterfly guides have provided a new way for amateur naturalists to identify species without collecting them or dissecting them. Previously, he said, butterfly books distinguished between species using technical, almost microscopic details. But in Mr. Glassberg‚Äôs years of field observation, Dr. Robbins said, he has found variations in the way butterflies appear that allow species ‚Äì or the sex of individuals of a species ‚Äì to be distinguished simply by looking.

The group was supposedly formed within the Turkish Armed Forces clandestinely. It was declared to be the governing council of Turkey during the coup attempt. The creation of the council was announced by Tijen Kara≈ü, a news anchor at the state-owned TRT news channel, allegedly at gunpoint. The name \\"Peace at Home Council\\" is derived from Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk's famous saying 'Peace at Home, Peace in the World'. Although it was self-declared as the successor to the incumbent 65th government of Turkey, the failure of the coup attempt meant that the Council never took de facto power in the country. Events The formation of the council and its dismissal of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government was announced live on the state broadcaster TRT after soldiers took over the channel's broadcasting headquarters. The stated aims of the council were \\"to reinstate constitutional order, human rights and freedoms, the rule of law and general security that was damaged\\". No set information regarding members and structure of the council were given and TRT suspended broadcasting shortly after the delivery of the statement announcing the council's creation. Statement and subsequent analysis The statement that was read on air at TRT headquarters, said (in Turkish) that =Analysis= A BBC article by Ezgi Ba≈üaran said that \\"the statement of the junta, that was ... read on ... government TV as the coup got under way, bore a strong resemblance to Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk's famous address to the Turkish Youth. [...] On the other hand, given that these references are too obvious, they may have been intentionally included to insinuate a Kemalist junta rather than a G√ºlenist one\\". =Staged coup allegations= In the aftermath of the coup attempt, commentators on social media alleged that the creation of the council had been staged to invoke greater support for the governing Justice and Development Party (AKP), with some sceptics citing the lack of any solid information on the council's actual composition as evidence that the entire ordeal had been faked by the government.\\" Composition No official statement regarding the composition of the council was given. According to the state-run Anadolu News Agency, subsequent investigations and allegations pointed to the leader being former Colonel Muharrem K√∂se, who had been dismissed earlier in 2016 from his role as legal advisor to the Chief of Staff due to his apparent links with Fethullah G√ºlen. Aftermath The Peace Council was eventually unable to take power after pro-coup forces were defeated and the incumbent AKP government retained control. Mass arrests were later made, targeting over two thousand soldiers including senior officers and generals. Speculation emerged that former Turkish Air Force Commander Akƒ±n √ñzt√ºrk had been in charge of the coup attempt.

Consultado: 10-13-15 Most recently, in 1985, the famous Conga from the Cuban- American group Miami Sound Machine, triggered a true frenzy in the US and all around the world. Its success is only comparable to the popularity of the 1930s Conga de Sal√≥n or the Conga lines of Desi Arnaz during the 1950s. From the 16th to the 18th century The miscegenation between blacks and whites in Cuba began with the arrival to the Island of the first slave African women around 1550Fern√°ndez Escobio, Fernando: Ra√≠ces de la nacionalidad cubana, Miami, Florida, 1992, p. 227. but their cultures remained relatively independent one from the other for hundreds of years, because the slaves didn't have access to their Masters cultural traditions, and the Spanish people perceived the African culture as barbaric and primitive. The following description of a black slave's feast, included in a story from the \\"costumbrista\\" writer Francisco Baralt, evidence the negative image that the Spanish had toward the cultural manifestations of the Africans. According to Baralt: \\"those (African) dances have such a weird aspect, because of the place, the time and the individuals that perform them, that even those who observe them every day receive an impression difficult to express: we don‚Äôt know if it is curiosity or disgust, if it repels or attract its primitive and savage character, that seem to put between this feasts and those of the white men the same distance that exists between the deluge and our times.\\"Baralt, Francisco: Escenas campestres.

According to David H. Brown, those societies, called Cabildos, \\"provided aid in case of disease or death, celebrated masses for the souls of the death, collected funds for the liberation from slavery of its members, regularly organized dances and recreational activities during Sundays and Holidays, and sponsored masses, processions and Carnival dances (now called \\"comparsas\\") around the annual cycle of Catholic festivals\\"Brown, David H.: Santer√≠a enthroned, The University of Chicago Press, Chicago 2003, p. 34. The Cabildos organized big street processions during Sundays, the celebration of Saints and some important Holidays, where their leaders and companions dressed with clothes appropriate for the royalty and high rank military, while those who participated in the processions and dances wear \\"feathered head pieces and African masks with horns and vegetal ornaments.\\" The Three Kings Day, celebrated on January 6, during the Epiphany, was the most important of those festivities.Brown, David H.: Santer√≠a enthroned, The University of Chicago Press, Chicago 2003, p. 34. Another important feast where the Cabildos participated was celebrated during the three days before \\"Ash Wednesday\\", which at a later time became the Carnestolendas or Carnival.Feli√∫, Virtudes: La Fiesta. Fiestas populares tradicionales de Cuba. Instituto Andino de Artes Populares, p. 83. In 1697, the Italian Gemeli Careri mentioned those celebrations: \\"‚Ä¶ on Sunday, February 9th, the black and mulatoes, with picturesque apparels, formed a gathering to have fun at the Carnival.\\" According to Virtudes Feli√∫: \\"‚Ä¶ This is the most ancient information about the traditional Havanese \\"comparsas\\", and it makes clear that, indeed, the blacks and mulatoes enjoyed themselves at the Carnestolendas that Hispanics and their descendants celebrated, wearing unusual clothes related to those feasts in a gathering that Careri called a \\"congregation\\", most probable because the term \\"comparsa\\" was not yet in use.\\"Feli√∫, Virtudes: La Fiesta. Fiestas populares tradicionales de Cuba. Instituto Andino de Artes Populares, p. 86. We can assume that the musical instruments utilized in the old Cabildos were the African membranophones that were not utilized in the ritual celebrations, such as the bemb√© and yuka drums. In reference to the difference between the ritual African drums, that should only be played in religious ceremonies, and the secular drums, that may actually be played in public, Argelier Le√≥n remarks: \\"Differently from the ritual drums bat√° and iyes√°, which were tuned with a tensor system in N‚Ä¶, the bemb√© drums could be tuned by applying heat, because they didn‚Äôt possess the ritual character of the consecrated drums.\\" Le√≥n also says that \\"‚Ä¶The bemb√© drums are varied, from those of a big size ‚Äì more than a meter tall and of a cylindrical shape ‚Äì to small drums made from containers. In certains areas of Cuba, the bemb√© drums are made from palm tree trunks, with just one nailed drumhead, and little more than half a meter tall‚Ä¶\\"Le√≥n, Argeliers: Del canto y del tiempo. Editorial Pueblo y Educaci√≥n. La Habana, Cuba, 1981, p. 46. The yuka ensemble was composed by three drums made from raw wooden trunks (called in size order: caja, mula and cachimbo) with hide drum- heads nailed to the body. They also utilized a hollow bambu piece beaten with two bamboo sticks called \\"guagua‚Äô‚Äô or \\"cat√°\\"; and also beating over the drum side.Le√≥n, ArgeliDel canto y del tiempo. Editorial Pueblo y Educaci√≥n. La Habana, Cuba, 1981, p. 67. In reference to the drums utilized by the Africans in their feasts, the \\"costumbrista\\" author Francisco Baralt wrote around 1846: \\"The only instrument they use in these feasts is a type of drum made from one wooden piece of about two to four feet long. With an irregular ..and a more or less conical or cylindrical shape. It was hollowwed up to half of its size, and usually covered over its larger side with a raw goat hide.\\"Baralt, Francisco: Escenas Campestres, Baile de los negros. http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra-visor/costumbristas-cubanos-del-siglo-xix --2/html/fef805c0-82b1-11df-acc7-002185ce6064_7.htm. Consultado 12-23-15. Three Kings Day. Print by Federico Miahle, 1855. These descriptions also coincide with the visual representations of the Carnivals, during the 19th century, by artists such as V√≠ctor Patricio de Landaluze and Federico Miahle; where frequently appear some cylindrical drums with a nailed hide on the top, performed between the legs of the standing drummer, in a very similar way as the yuka drums are played even today. In numerous prints of Landaluze and Miahle about the Carnival festivities, we can observe some musical instruments, like drums and horns, that were utilized at that time. In a famous Miahle print from 1855, called Three Kings Days, we can see a drummer to the left side, playing a cylindric drum between his legs, and another man at the back, with a hat, blowing a curved horn. The 19th century According with David H. Brown: \\"After 1792, when the Cabildos were relegated to the \\"extramuros\\" zone of the city, the Carnival processions came out of their locations and went through the entrances toward the fortified \\"intramuros\\" area. They marched through the residential and commercial streets of Mercaderes, Obispo and O‚ÄôReilly until they reached the central Plaza de Armas, the site of the Captain General of the Island Palace. Inside the Palace patio, as in other stops along the way, the procession's members represented dances, asked for and received gifts (aguinaldos), and after that, they returned to their homes.\\"Brown, David H.: Santer√≠a enthroned, The University of Chicago Press, Chicago 2003, p. 35. In the following story from 1866, the author mentions the characteristic sounds as well as the instruments that were performed by those participants in the procession of a Three Kings Day \\"comparsa\\" in Havana: \\"Innumerable groups of black Africans \\"comparsas\\" went along through every street of the Capital city. The hurly-burly is immense and its aspect horrifying... The great noise created by all the drums, horns and whistles deafen the passers-by everywhere; in a corner a Yoruba king surrounded by his court of blacks, here a Gang√°, another one there from a Carabal√≠ nation... all of them, kings for a day, singing in a monotonous and unpleasant drone in their African languages.\\"Moore, Robin D.: Nationalizing blackness. University of Pittsburgh Press. Pittsburgh. Pa., 1997, p. 65. The 20th century At the beginning of the Independence war, in 1895, the colonial authorities banned all the Carnival activities indefinitely, and this prohibition stayed in effect until the conclusion of the hostilities, at the beginning of the 20th century. The Mayor of Havana, Carlos de La Torre, reinstate the Carnival festivities officially in 1902. The massive participation of a population of African origin in the Independence war resulted in a greater integration of the Afro-Cubans in social activities, and facilitated a more important participation of this segment of the population in the Carnival during the first years of the Republic. For the first time blacks were allowed to play their music and dances along with the \\"comparsas\\" of white people, such as El Alacr√°n, the Model T cars covered by flower arrangements and the \\"carrozas\\" (floats).Moore, Robin D.: Nationalizing blackness. University of Pittsburgh Press. Pittsburgh. Pa., 1997, p. 68. Since 1902, the municipal authorities began again to strictly regulate the organization of the Carnival processions, showing a preference for the ornamented cars, the floats, the military bands, and the presentation of the King and the Queen, in detriment of the manifestation of Afro-Cuban origin, such as the \\"comparsa\\" and the Conga, and around 1916, the suppression of the \\"comparsa\\" groups in Havana was almost total.Moore, Robin D.: Nationalizing blackness. University of Pittsburgh Press. Pittsburgh. Pa., 1997, p. 69. Because during the period from the 1900s and 1910s, the Carnival activities have attracted thousands of foreign visitors to the Capital each spring, finally in 1937, the authorities of the city decided to reauthorize the \\"comparsas\\" in the Carnival \\"paseos\\" (strolls).Moore, Robin D.: Nationalizing blackness. University of Pittsburgh Press. Pittsburgh. Pa., 1997, p. 83. In 1937, the \\"comparsas\\" began to permanently participate in the Havanese Carnivals, parading through the Paseo del Prado with distinctive choreographies, dances and songs. Those groups included: El Alacr√°n, from the Cerro neighborhood, Los Marqueses from Atar√©s, Las Boyeras from Los Sitios, Los Dandys from Bel√©n, La Sultana from Col√≥n, Las Jardineras from Jes√∫s Mar√≠a, Los Componedoras de Batea from Cayo Hueso, El Pr√≠ncipe del Raj from Marte, las Mexicanas from Dragones, Los Moros Azules from Guanabacoa, El Barrac√≥n from Pueblo Nuevo and Los Guaracheros from Regla. Celebrados en el mes de Julio, Los Carnavales de Santiago de Cuba y otros pueblos orientales pose√≠an sus propias caracter√≠sticas. En vez de encontrarse reducidas a ciertas calles y plazas como en la capital, las comparsas santiagueras se extend√≠an a toda la ciudad y la poblaci√≥n participaba m√°s activamente en ellas.

At the beginning, this change was made in order not to interrupt the sugar cane harvest in 1979, but it was kept in place at a later time with the purpose of celebrating the \\"triumph of socialism.\\" Between 1990 and 1995 isolated presentations were offered, which were associated to political events. Those included some groups that went to the streets in November 1993, in order to celebrate the anniversary of the CDRs (Revolution Defense Committees). Finally, in an attempt to attract a larger number of tourists, the government authorized again a modest Carnival celebration, preceding the celebration of Lent (Cuaresma), instead of in July, when it was previously accustomed.Moore, Robin D.: Nationalizing blackness. University of Pittsburgh Press. Pittsburgh. Pa., 1997, p. 85. Music of the Cuban Carnival Cuban Tumbadora. The Cuban Carnival music ensembles used to be varied, but it is also possible to determine certain patterns in reference to the instrumental groups utilized in Havana and Santiago de Cuba, which differ significantly. This is how Argeliers Le√≥n describes the basic instrumental of the Havanese comparsa: \\"‚Ä¶In other zones of the population still remained other instrumental groups such as those of the comparsas, a Conga, a tumbadora and a quinto, a snare drum (without the snares), a double cow-bell or \\"jimagua\\", a bass drum or two frying pans attached to a wooden box or a board. This equipment may be expanded with two tumbadoras and one or more trumpets.Le√≥n, Argeliers: Del canto y del tiempo. Editorial Pueblo y Educaci√≥n. La Habana, Cuba, 1981, p. 29. The drum called Conga or tumbadora, of an evident Bantu origin, is, according to Fernando Ortiz: \\"‚Ä¶ a drum from African origin, made of wooden slabs and iron rings, from approximately a meter long, barrel shape, and opened on one end with only one hide drumhead fixed by nails to the body of the drum‚Ä¶\\" It was tuned using heat in the past, but currently is tuned with metallic tuning pegs.Orovio, Helio: Cuban music from A to Z. Tumi Music Ltd. Bath, U.K., 2004, p. 57. The tumbadora's diameter are as follows, from treble to bass: requinto (9 to 10 inches), quinto (10 t 11 inches), Conga (macho or tres-dos) (11 to 12 inches), tumbadora (or hembra) (12 to 13 inches), retumbadora (or mambisa) (14 inches). In the comparsas and Congas of Santiago de Cuba various bimembranophone drums, beaten with drumsticks, are utilized: one requinto, three Congas (without any relationship with the Havanese Conga), which are subdivided in two redoblantes or galletas, and one pil√≥n. They also utilize various membranophone drums (with a conical shape and only one drumhead, played with the palms of the hands) called boc√∫es. The drums are complemented by three percuted metallic idiophones (made from discarded wheel rims), which are selected considering its sonority.Rodr√≠guez Ruid√≠az, Armando: El carnaval cubano y su m√∫sica, p. 11. https://www.academia.edu/19810545/El_Carnaval_Cubano_y_su_m%C3%BAsica The wind instruments are represented by the piercing sound of the corneta china, a double-reed Chinese instrument that was inserted in the Santiago de Cuba Congas in 1915.,P√©rez Fern√°ndez, Rolando:The Chinese community and the corneta china: Two divergent paths in Cuba, Yearbook 2014, p. 79. and that always performs the initial call to start the Conga (arrollar), which is how the dancing style of the Conga is called, characterized by a peculiar form of rhythmic march, dragging the feet and moving the hips and shoulders along with the music rhythm. The musical style of the Havanese Conga is quite different from the Conga Santiaguera, and maybe the element that mostly differentiate both styles is a peculiar rhythmic accent within the 4/4 meter, which is executed by the Havanese Bass drum or the Conga (drum) from Santiago, respectively. In the Havanese style, this accent falls on a syncopated note on the third beat of the measure, configurating a very well known rhythmic pattern (one, two, three, cick). In the Conga from Santiago, the stressed beats of the measure are more emphasized, thus inducing a powerful impulse feeling, which incites to move the feet along with the rhythmic pulse. In this case, the drum accent is played between the fourth beat of the previous measure and the first of the following measure.Rodr√≠guez Ruid√≠az, Armando: El carnaval cubano y su m√∫sica, p. 12-13. https://www.academia.edu/19810545/El_Carnaval_Cubano_y_su_m%C3%BAsica See also Carnival of Santiago de Cuba Conga (music) References Santiago de Cuba Folk festivals in Cuba July events Conga (music) Carnivals in Cuba ","title":"Cuban carnival"},{"id":"51082920","text":"Chris Waller may refer to: * Chris Waller (gymnast) (born 1968), American gymnast * Chris Waller (cricketer) (born 1948), English cricketer * Chris Waller (actor), British actor * Chris Waller (horse trainer), (born 1973), New Zealand born champion thoroughbred horse trainer ","title":"Chris Waller"},{"id":"51082926","text":"The 16th District of the Iowa Senate is located in southern Iowa, and is currently composed of Polk County.

In newborn babies it continues to be the preferred treatment for very low blood pressure. In children epinephrine or norepinephrine is generally preferred while in adults norepinephrine is generally preferred for very low blood pressure. It is given intravenously or intraosseously as a continuous infusion. Effects typically begin within five minutes. Doses are then increased to effect. Common side effects include worsening kidney function, an irregular heartbeat, chest pain, vomiting, headache, or anxiety. If it enters into the soft tissue around the vein local tissue death may occur. The medication phentolamine can be given to try to decrease this risk. It is unclear if dopamine is safe to use during pregnancy or breastfeeding. At low doses dopamine mainly triggers dopamine receptors and Œ≤1-adrenergic receptors while at high doses it works via Œ±-adrenergic receptors. Dopamine was first synthesized in a laboratory in 1910 by George Barger and James Ewens in England. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In human physiology dopamine is a neurotransmitter as well as a hormone. Medical uses =Low blood pressure= In newborn babies it continues to be the preferred treatment for very low blood pressure. In children epinephrine or norepinephrine is generally preferred while in adults norepinephrine is generally preferred for very low blood pressure. In those with low blood volume, this should be corrected with intravenous fluids before dopamine is considered. =Kidney function= Low-dosage dopamine has been routinely used for the treatment and prevention of acute kidney injury. However, since 1999 a number of reviews have concluded that doses at such low levels are not effective and may sometimes be harmful. =Administration= Since the half- life of dopamine in plasma is short‚Äîapproximately one minute in adults, two minutes in newborn babies and up to five minutes in preterm babies‚Äîit is usually given as a continuous intravenous drip rather than a single injection. =Other= A fluorinated form of L-DOPA known as fluorodopa is available for use in positron emission tomography to assess the function of the nigrostriatal pathway. Contraindications Dopamine should generally not be given to people who have a pheochromocytoma or uncorrected very fast heart rate. Side effects The LD50, or dose which is expected to prove lethal in 50% of the population, has been found to be: 59 mg/kg (mouse; administered intravenously); 950 mg/kg (mouse; administered intraperitoneally); 163 mg/kg (rat; administered intraperitoneally); 79 mg/kg (dog; administered intravenously). =Extravasation= If extravasation occurs local tissue death may result. The medication phentolamine can be injected at the site to try to decrease the risk of tissue death. Mechanism of action Its effects, depending on dosage, include an increase in sodium excretion by the kidneys, an increase in urine output, an increase in heart rate, and an increase in blood pressure. At low doses it acts through the sympathetic nervous system to increase heart muscle contraction force and heart rate, thereby increasing cardiac output and blood pressure. Higher doses also cause vasoconstriction that further increases blood pressure. While some effects result from stimulation of dopamine receptors, the prominent cardiovascular effects result from dopamine acting at Œ±1, Œ≤1, and Œ≤2 adrenergic receptors.

Life Claghorn was born on February 12, 1864 in Aurora, Illinois, but grew up in New York City. She earned a bachelor's degree in 1892 from Bryn Mawr College, and completed a Ph.D. from Yale University in 1896. She was part of only the third cohort of women doctorates from Yale ‚Äì the school opened admission to women in 1892 and the first seven graduated in 1894. ‚Äì and she became the first to receive her degree publicly, at Yale's commencement ceremony. At Bryn Mawr she studied political economy under Franklin Henry Giddings, and at Yale she studied \\"industrial history, advanced economics, political science, and anthropology\\" with William Graham Sumner and Arthur Twining Hadley;Author biography, The Writer: A Monthly Magazine for Literary Workers, Volume 10, 1897, pp. 102‚Äì103. her dissertation was entitled Law, Nature, and Convention, a Study in Political Theory.. Claghorn became the first paid secretary-treasurer of the Association of Collegiate Alumnae, the predecessor organization to the American Association of University Women, in 1898.. She worked briefly for the US Industrial Commission, the Economic Year Book, and the US Census Office before joining the New York Tenement House Department as assistant registrar in 1902; she was promoted to registrar in 1906. Her $3000 salary made her the highest-paid female civil servant in New York.. A magazine story at the time wrote: In 1912 she took a position as a lecturer and head of the Department of Social Research at the New York School of Applied Philanthropy (later to become the New York School of Social Work),. where she taught courses on immigration and statistics.. She remained at the school until 1932. She died in 1938 and was buried in Maple Grove Cemetery.. Contributions and opinions Claghorn was a frequent writer for magazines, and published her first book, College Training for Women, in 1896.College Training for Women on archive.org, retrieved 2016-07-15.Review of College Training for Women, The Western Christian Advocate, vol. 64 (June 16, 1897), p. 746.Review of College Training for Women, Literary Chat, Munsey's Magazine, vol. 18 (1898), pp. 153‚Äì154. In a report for the New York Tenement House Department in 1901, Claghorn decried newspaper propaganda linking immigration to poverty,. and noted the particular enthusiasm for schooling displayed by Jewish immigrant children.. In a study that she wrote in 1904 for the department, Claghorn foresaw that new groups of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe were not more likely to become impoverished, in the long term, than the previous immigrants from Britain and Germany... Another of her books was Juvenile Delinquency in Rural New York (U. S. Department of labor. Children's bureau, no. 32, 1918).Juvenile Delinquency in Rural New York on archive.org, retrieved 2016-07-15.Review of Juvenile Delinquency in Rural New York, Monthly Labor Review, vol. 8 (1919), US Bureau of Labor Statistics, pp. 196‚Äì198. As well as surveying this issue, it recommended moving juvenile cases from the local justice of the peace to a county juvenile court, changing the juvenile court system to make it more accessible, adding a separate juvenile detention system instead of institutionalizing delinquents, and increasing the age of adulthood from 16 to 18.. In her 1923 book, The Immigrants' Day in Court, Claghorn argued that the legal aid available at the time was inadequate, focusing primarily on legal minutiae rather than on understanding the actual issues affecting their clients, and that it inappropriately excluded female attorneys from serving... She also reported on the injustice caused by inadequate translation for non- English-speaking legal clients,.. and on the sexual harassment of female workers by job placement workers and supervisors.. Writing about this book in 2003, British historians Kristofer Allerfeldt and Jeremy Black called it \\"the one significant contemporary study of the immigrant and the American legal system\\".. Associations While working at the Tenement House Department, Claghorn became the founding treasurer of the Equality League of Self- Supporting Women (later to become the Women's Political Union), an organization founded in 1907 by suffragette Harriot Eaton Stanton Blatch as \\"the political wing of the Women's Trade Union League\\".. In 1909 Claghorn was one of 60 signers of the \\"Call for the Lincoln Emancipation Conference to Discuss Means for Securing Political and Civil Equality for the Negro\\", which became the founding document of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.. Claghorn chaired a committee of the American Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology on connections between crime and immigration, which produced its report in 1917.. In 1918 she was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association..

Background Eunice (born, July 23, 1974) was a deaconess of the Divine Touch Parish of the Redeemed Christian Church of God and a mother of seven. She was an indigene of Ekiti State and had been married to her husband, Elisha Olawale, from Ondo state since 2000. She was described by her husband as hardworking, God-fearing and supportive in sustaining the family. She was also described by others as a humble woman and a passionate preacher. The family lived in the Kubwa area of the capital city of Abuja, Nigeria. She was well known to have been preaching in that area for many years. Incident Eunice usually left her home every morning at 5 a.m. before dawn to evangelize (usually referred to as morning cry) in the streets of Abuja. Several days before her gruesome murder, she overheard nearby Muslims comment about her preaching, that she should be chased away. She also overheard another conversation from a mosque behind their home which implied that her preaching wasn't the truth about God. After she informed her husband about what she heard, he cautioned her to be careful. After those incidents, Eunice suspended her daily morning evangelism for about a week after which she resumed. A Muslim cleric who came to their house requested for food for his Islamic school. After she stated that she didn't have any food to give him at that time, he left. Eunice was murdered on the 9th of July, 2016 after she left the house at the usual time to preach. According to several media reports, Eunice was murdered between 5 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. Accounts differ as to the exact manner she was murdered. Several reports stated that she was beheaded and stabbed. Other sources stated that she was stabbed multiple times in the stomach and the leg before bleeding to death. People heard her screaming \\"Blood of Jesus!\\" at about the time she was murdered. At around 6: 30 to 7:30 am, her husband Olawale woke up from his bed. The first sign of his wife's murder were alarming calls from his children about comments made by some nearby football players, specifying a woman killed while preaching and her lifeless body laying on the ground in a pool of blood. Immediately, he heard the information, Olawale dialed his wife's phone to verify, but realized it had been switched off. Afterwards, Olawale got more information and directive to confirm his dead wife at the police station. He saw her lifeless body. Her megaphone, bible and mobile phone were still close to her body. Aftermath The gruesome murder of Eunice sparked outrage on social media among Nigerians especially between Christians and Muslims which further revealed divides among religious lines. The state of religious tolerance in the country became an issue of concern. Six suspects were arrested in connection with the murder. Many residents living close to the area where Eunice was murdered moved away for fear of being arrested as suspects. Christians were urged to protect themselves as much as possible especially while evangelizing. The wife of the Vice President, Oludolapo Osinbajo and pastor E. A. Adeboye paid condolence visits to the family. Her burial was put on hold until further investigations revealed the perpetrators and brought them to justice. Eunice's murder did not deter other preachers, one of whom was reported to continue her morning preaching at the exact spot Eunice was murdered. The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) gave the Nigerian police 14 days ultimatum to undergo further investigations pertaining to her murder and bring the perpetrators to book. Her death case remains unresolved.

Arabella, her mistress, encourages Bessy to write her thoughts and experiences in a journal. She also subjects Bessy to odd experiments, but Bessy goes along with them because she is flattered by the attention and quickly grows attached to her mistress.

It was released on 10 July 2010 for Android, and later for iOS. The game was originally created by Andreas Pantesj√∂ and Simon Sikstr√∂m, who still actively maintain and develop the game. The game has more than 250,000 registered players (in December 2019) and is free to play. Players can pay a voluntary fee to receive \\"supporter\\" status, which gives access to additional in-app statistics, but comes with no gameplay benefits. The game has received media attention from Swedish, Finnish and Danish newspapers.  Gameplay  Turf combines elements from traditional orienteering with elements commonly seen in many video games, such as a leveling system, leaderboards and achievements. The goal is to collect points by capturing virtual zones using the built-in GPS system of modern smartphones, and try to keep them for as long as possible to compete with other players. Zones are located all over the world, but with the highest concentration in countries with active competition, such as Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Great Britain. Zones are most commonly taken by foot or by bicycle, but occasionally zones are captured by other means, such as by boat and by car. Turf is by many players used as an exergame, a way of combining exercise with gaming. It has also been compared with augmented reality games Ingress and Pok√©mon Go.  Game rounds  Turf is played in rounds that each last for a month. Collected points by the player reset when a new round starts, as well as all ownership of the zones in the game. Total accumulated points by the player never reset after a round ends, as these are used to determine a player's rank as well as provide useful statistics for players to track their progress. At the end of a round the winner may choose to create a unique, custom zone anywhere, often referred to as a \\"winner zone\\".  Events  There are special events arranged when players gather in a city to compete. A major annual event is called a Bonanza, where participants gather in a city and run a standalone game session that lasts for a couple hours. Bonanzas are characterized by dense placement of zones in a game environment separate from the regular game to make the contest a standalone championship. The first Bonanza organized for Djurg√•rden in Stockholm, Sweden, on 21 May 2011. In 2016, it was held in Kalmar.. In both 2012 and 2018 it was held in V√§ster√•s, Sweden . Other, smaller, events also occur that are similar to the major annual Bonanza event. They can be situated in different places with different orientations (canoe, only by foot, long seclusion etc.) In 19 June 2011, one of the first Turf events was at Dreamhack in Sweden. An event can also be a closed event where only the invited have access, with small groups such as school physical education. In 2016, more than 300 physical education lessons consisted of \\"orientation\\" of the Turf.

The company is known for its angle of hiring former Marines within the solar industry, as well as its focus on American culture in its marketing. History Semper Solaris founder John Almond was previously involved in the construction business, and had changed his focus to solar energy upon establishing the company. It was said co-founder Kelly Shawhan had worked in solar energy since 1989. Kelly Shawhan was previously a United States Marine Corps captain. It was reported the company's name choice was based on the Marine Corps motto \\"semper fidelis\\" and an oath that Shawhan had with 12 other Marines in the Philippines in 1985. In 2015, the company installed a total 0.400 megawatts that year which reportedly fluctuated from 0.200 in 2014. Solar manufacturer SunPower gave the company a 'Residential National Dealer of the Year' title in 2015. In 2016, three Semper Solaris employees had stopped to save two passengers out of burning box truck, which had drove off Route 163's guardrail and onto the Route 305 in San Diego County. The Semper Solaris employees, received a \\"Special Commendation\\" from the Mayor's office of San Diego. Corporate affairs The company is known for its hiring of former Marines and United States Military which in return coalesces a company culture based on the values of the said military cultures. Homeboy Industries's \\"Solar Panel Training Program\\" have been linked to the company's hiring of ex-convicts. Semper Solaris has charted Solar Power World's Top Solar Contractors list for four years. Jawad Khan of Business.com's marketing journal reported that the company's supporting of military and local businesses, as well as American made products were a distinct angle in online marketing. Khan stated that the company's expression of values would be effective for certain audiences. In 2013, Joseph Calack of engineering journal RFCafe praised the dealer for its transparent sale of a photovoltaic SunPower solar system.

He is the author of one law book, and the author or co- author of 30 law journal articles or book chapters on topics including constitutional law, criminal law, administrative law, human rights, and the rights of persons with disabilities. His publications have been cited with approval in several decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada, as well as by trial and appeal courts across Canada. He has lectured on topics including these across Canada, and in the U.S., Israel, the Republic of Ireland, Denmark and Belgium.

A domesticated goat in Nepal. History Animals were reared in the distant past in Nepal, but the history of proper animal husbandry in the country dates back to the period of the Gopal Dynasty. It is believed that Gopal kings used to rear cows. When the Gopals entered Nepal from India, they brought cows with them. Similarly, the Mahispal dynasty used to rear buffalo. Present status In Nepal, animal husbandry is one of the main occupations, along with farming, as Nepal is an agricultural country. About 30% of the total population is engaged in agriculture. In Nepal, people rear different animals like goats, pigs, Cattle, oxen, buffalos, Chickens and dogs. However, the horse is not as widely reared in Nepal as it is in European countries. Butter, milk, meat, and wool are the main products of animal husbandry. Wool is exported to India and other countries. Different wool and woolen products are produced. Nepali mats called galaicha command a high price when exported to foreign regions such as Europe, Australia, and America. Dairy production is also increasing due to the rearing of milk-giving animals. Nepal has just started using modern tools for animal husbandry, so there is a chance for further development of animal husbandry. Meat and eggs are also some of the main goods produced by animal husbandry. Poultry farming in Nepal Poultry farms can also be found throughout Nepal. Additionally, improved breeds of animals are reared in Nepal these days, which is increasing income for Nepalese people. Among other animals, cows are reared the most because of their religious and economic significance. Cows are regarded as the incarnation of the goddess Lakshmi. There is a restriction on killing cows in Nepal because it is the national animal. So cows are found in almost every house in village areas of Nepal. Promotion of Animal Husbandry online Farmers are more encouraged and motivated through schemes and offer that is given by a tech company called Rising Farm. Founded by Engineer Shashank Shree Neupane, this company is involving farmers and investors to invest on the nurture of animals.

Urban Projects and the Clone  Thrashbird is known for putting his work in urban areas where his message can reach a large target audience. The artist became known with his image of the texting clone, a silhouette of a slender figure in a hoodie, glued to his phone and hunched to read the screen. When Blackberry Phones were popular, Thrashbird noticed this his friends were more interested in their phones than in the world around them. When the iPhone was released this trend got worse, inspiring Thrashbird to respond through his art.  Desert Projects  More recently, Thrashbird has expanded his city practice to the desert, exploring the energies of the natural landscape and abandoned built environments. Combining the topography of the desert and its neglected structures with the artist‚Äôs creativity, Thrashbird designs from the shapes and surfaces he encounters and transforms them into something playful and nostalgic.  Public Activism and Auctions  Awareness and activism are central themes in Thrashbird's work and the artist has presented in several symposia to talk about them. For example, in 2016 he was a featured guest at the LA Art Show speaking on a panel on the Commercialization of Street Art. His work has been included in street art auctions, including the 2016 Street Art and Contemporary Art sale at Julien's Auctions alongside works by Banksy, Shepard Fairey and Mr. Brainwash.

Located primarily in Makati with a short portion in Taguig, it facilitates access from the Makati Central Business District to the Bonifacio Global City and, ultimately, to Circumferential Road 5 (C-5). Preparation work for the flyover began in 1997, when the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) announced the construction of two new primary access points to the Bonifacio Global City, with the flyover serving as the main western access point to the area. Designed by Katahira & Engineers Asia, actual construction of the flyover began in late 1997 with the construction of the segment between Gil Puyat Avenue and EDSA, contracted to the Uy-Pajara Construction Company. Work on the segment between Kalayaan Avenue and the Bonifacio Global City meanwhile began in April 1999, with the work being contracted to F.F. Cruz and Co., one of the Philippines' largest construction companies. Capable of holding up to 4,000 vehicles at one time, the flyover would reduce travel times between Makati and the Bonifacio Global City to five minutes by providing a direct connection between the two business districts instead of needing to route vehicles through EDSA. The flyover was inaugurated by President Joseph Estrada and other government officials on January 25, 2000. Although promoted as a public project, it has been rumored that the ‚Ç±950 million spent for the flyover's construction did not come from public funds, but rather was underwritten by the First Pacific group through their local subsidiary, Metro Pacific. Despite being a flyover, the entire road is designated as National Route 191 (N191) of the Philippine highway network.

Variations  Depending on dialect, has at least the following allophones in varieties of English around the world:Wells, John C. (1982). Accents of English. Volume 1: An Introduction, Volume 2: The British Isles, Volume 3: Beyond the British Isles. Cambridge University Press. *\\"Standard\\" R: postalveolar approximant (a common realization of the phoneme worldwide, Received Pronunciation and General American included) *\\"Bunched\\" or \\"Molar\\" R: \\"bunched-tongue\\" alveolar approximant (occurs in Southern American English and some Midwestern and Western American English most strongly); in fact, there is often a continuum of possible realizations for the postalveolar approximant within any single dialect from a more apical articulation to this more bunched articulation *\\"Velar\\" R: velarized alveolar approximant (occurs in conservative Irish English)Hickey, Raymond (2007). Irish English: History and present-day forms. Cambridge University Press. pp. 14-15, 320. *\\"Retroflex\\" R: retroflex approximant (occurs in some American and most Irish English, including Northern Irish English) *\\"Flapped\\" or \\"Tapped\\" R: alveolar flap (occurs in Scouse, most Scottish English, some South African, Welsh, Indian, conservative Irish and Northern England English, and early twentieth- century Received Pronunciation; not to be confused with flapping of and ) *\\"Trilled\\" or \\"Rolled\\" R: alveolar trill (occurs in Afrikaans English, some Welsh English, some very conservative Scottish English, Indian English and Jersey English) *\\"Uvular\\" R or \\"Northumbrian burr\\": voiced uvular fricative (occurs in very conservative varieties of Geordie and Northumbrian dialect, though largely now disappeared, as well as possibly some conservative South- West and East Irish English and some Aberdeen English) *\\"Labial\\" or \\"Rounded\\" R: labiodental approximant (occurs in some south-east England and London English as a presumed idiosyncrasy, though this is disputed, as is its overlap with rhotacism; see ¬ß R-labialization below) In most dialects is labialized in many positions, as in reed and tree ; in the latter case, the may be slightly labialized as well. In General American, it is labialized at the beginning of a word but not at the end. In many dialects, in the cluster , as in dream, is realized as a postalveolar fricative or less commonly alveolar . In , as in tree, it is a voiceless postalveolar fricative or less commonly alveolar . In England, while the approximant has become the most common realization, may still be pronounced as a voiceless tap after (as in thread). Tap realization of after is also reported in some parts of the United States, particularly Utah. There are two primary articulations of the approximant : apical (with the tip of the tongue approaching the alveolar ridge or even curled back slightly) and domal (with a centralized bunching of the tongue known as molar r or sometimes bunched r or braced r ). Peter Ladefoged wrote: \\"Many BBC English speakers have the tip of the tongue raised towards the roof of the mouth in the general location of the alveolar ridge, but many American English speakers simply bunch the body of the tongue up so that it is hard to say where the articulation is\\". The extension to the IPA recommends the use of the IPA diacritics for \\"apical\\" and \\"centralized\\", as in , to distinguish apical and domal articulations in transcription. However, this distinction has little or no perceptual consequence, and may vary idiosyncratically between individuals. Rhoticity and non-rhoticity All English accents around the world are frequently characterized as either rhotic or non-rhotic. The majority of accents in England, Wales, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa speak non-rhotic accents, and in these dialects the historical English phoneme /r/ is not pronounced except when followed by a vowel. However, the historical /r/ is pronounced in all contexts in rhotic accents, which are spoken across the majority in Scotland, Ireland, the United States, Canada, and also in some English accents (for example West Country and some parts of Lancashire and the far north). Thus, a rhotic accent pronounces marker as , while a non-rhotic accent pronounces the same word as . Generally speaking in rhotic accents, when is not followed by a vowel phoneme, it surfaces as r-coloring of the preceding vowel or its coda: nurse , butter .  R-labialization  R-labialization, not to be confused with the rounding of initial described above, is a process occurring in certain dialects of English, particularly some varieties of Cockney, in which the phoneme is realized as a labiodental approximant in contrast to an alveolar approximant . Use of labiodental is commonly stigmatized by prescriptivists. Regardless, it is used in many other languages and its use is growing in many accents of British English.Foulkes, Paul, and Gerard J. Docherty. (eds.) (1999). Urban Voices. Arnold Most speakers who do so are from the southeast of England, particularly London. It has also been reported to be an extremely rare realization of in New Zealand English. The realization may not always be labiodental: bilabial and velarized labiodental realizations have been reported. R-labialization leads to pronunciations such as the following: * red ‚Äì * ring ‚Äì * rabbit ‚Äì * Merry Christmas ‚Äì However, replacement of by some kind of labial approximant may also occur due to a type of speech impediment called rhotacism or derhotacization.

Her research includes the use of high-altitude scientific balloon experiments to study Earth's radiation belts, specifically, the loss of relativistic electrons from the outer radiation belts into Earth's atmosphere. Millan is principal investigator for the BARREL (Balloon Array for RBSP Relativistic Electron Losses) project, in which two balloon launches in 2013 and 2014 (of 20 such balloons) floated in the circular wind patterns above the South Pole. Each balloon tracked electrons from space that get swept up in Earth's magnetic field and slide down into Earth's atmosphere. The first test of BARREL‚Äîfunded by NASA and also supported by NSF's Office of Polar Programs that supports logistics of all research in Antarctica‚Äîbegan in December 2008. Her prior positions include research appointments at Dartmouth and at the University of California, Berkeley. Millan served on the NRC Committee on the role and scope of mission-enabling activities in NASA's space and earth science missions and on the panel on solar wind-magnetosphere interactions for the committee for a decadal strategy for solar and space physics (heliophysics).

His artwork usually responds to current events from sources in the news, pop culture, and art history. Ever since his debut 2002 video animation of The Simpson Verdict, Ezawa has been known for his flattened style in works on paper, light-boxes, and videos. By flattening his pieces into more two-dimensional figures, he creates more focus on the re-contextualized historical events in his pieces. Originally from Germany, he moved to San Francisco in 1994 and is currently based in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Biography  Ezawa grew up outside Stuttgart, Germany in a rural area, his father was an immigrant to Germany from Japan. He attended Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf from 1990 until 1994 and studied with Nan Hoover and Nam June Paik. He moved in 1994 to San Francisco, California. He graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1995 from San Francisco Art Institute (SFAI). In 2003 he received his Master of Fine Arts degree from Stanford University. Since 2000, Ezawa has produced his own abstracted computer animations. His work often juxtaposes seemingly contrary videos, politics, and celebrity recounting historical events, reminding the viewer that history is seen through an interpretative lens. In 2005 he received the Artadia Award. In 2006, Ezawa received a SECA Art Award. He is an Associate Professor of Film and Fine Arts at California College of the Arts (CCA). Kota Ezawa has exhibited his work in solo exhibitions at Chrysler Museum of Art (2015), Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (2013), Wexner Center for the Arts (2009), St. Louis Art Museum, Artpace (2006), the Wadsworth Atheneum and many others.  Work  * Simpson Verdict (2002): Ezawa took three years to create the 3 minute animation of the O.J. Simpson‚Äôs verdict. The animation reduces the international event to an exaggerated, simple cartoon. This work is in the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) permanent collection. *The History of Photography Remix (2004‚Äì2006) This project explored how photographs act as a reflection of reality and how they can distort memories of people and events. Ezawa used photographs from art history textbooks for his sources of photography and with these photographs he reproduced them into his minimalistic and flattened style. This effect equalized all of the photographs so that they all read as similar images to the human eye instead of individual content. * Lennon, Sontag, Beuys (2004): Animation portrays three politically active artists, Lennon, Sontag, and Beuys. This video sheds light on each artist stating their social and political platforms. * The Unbearable Lightness of Being (2005): Animation about the assassinations of Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy produced with old news footage and with the 1915 film Birth of a Nation. The name of the film is taken from a book of the same title by Milan Kundera. * LYAM 3D (2008): A silent, colored, and four minute animation that gives new meaning to Alain Resnais‚Ä≤ 1960s French New Wave film, L'Ann√©e derni√®re √† Marienbad (Last Year at Marienbad). Ezawa used many sources like the news media and popular cinema to create a video with his flattened style that only kept essential shapes. * Choco Drink TV (2012): Sculpture of a mechanical television made from found objects such as wooden spoons and a Nesquik can, the images on the screen are of Kota's work. Channels can be changed by moving the wooden spoon. *National Anthem (2018): Watercolor animation was installed at the 2019 Whitney Biennial. The animated art piece addressees police brutality and racism. The inspiration behind this piece is the event where the San Francisco 49ers football player, Colin Kaepernick, took a knee during the National Anthem in protest of police officers being violent towards black men who are unarmed.

History Beyond Comics was launched by Graig Weich, who began reading comic books as a child, finding in them a sense of hope and inspiration when he was bullied as a child. \\"When my friends and I were bullied, I thought, 'If we were superheroes, we could defend the kids being attacked.'\\"Orel, Gwen (December 13, 2013). \\"See you in the funny papers, Montclair\\". NorthJersey.com. After the September 11 attacks, Weich spoke with some children who informed him that they did not feel there were any heroes that they could identify with. In response, Weich created the superhero Justice, a man who, following the death of his girlfriend at the World Trade Center, wears an American flag as a mask, and takes it upon himself to confront terrorists. Weich created the character to symbolize hope and empowerment for civilians. The first year's proceeds from the first book featuring the character, titled Civilian Justice, were donated to the Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York, and the families from Windows on the World (ROC NY) HERE Fund, which aided victims and families of non-union workers who lost their lives in the attacks.

They were built between 1902 and 1910 on land that was previously used as a government stock farm and are listed as heritage sites at the National Trust of Trinidad and Tobago. Stollmeyer's Castle was the first building in the neighborhood and took several years to complete, as was typical of the Magnificent Seven. The structures were designed in an array of architectural styles including French Colonial, Scottish baronial, Indian Empire, and Moorish Mediterranean styles‚Äîoften blended with Caribbean architecture. Many have unusual elements, like the chiming clock and lighted clock tower of Queen's Royal College. Stollmeyer's Castle is said to be modeled after a wing of Balmoral Castle. Hayes Court, a French Colonial style building, has contemporary Scottish cast iron elements and traditional Demerara windows. White Hall is made of natural white limestone of Barbados. Some of the structures were made of imported materials, like Italian marble and Scottish cast iron elements. Most were originally built as residences and kept within families for decades. Archbishop's House was built as, and remains, the official residence of the Archbishop of Port of Spain. The Anglican Bishop to Trinidad resided in Hayes Court. Queen's Royal College was built as a secondary school for boys. White Hall was used as the Office of the Prime Minister from 1963 to 2009. White Hall and Stollmeyer's Castle fall under the purview of the Office of the Prime Minister. The two buildings had restoration work so that they could be used by foreign dignitaries visiting Port of Spain. Both buildings were commandeered by the United States Armed Forces during World War II. Most of the Magnificent Seven Houses retain the aesthetics of the original designs. Of the buildings, Milles Fleur is the one most in disrepair due to extended periods where it was not occupied or maintained. Overview The properties are listed by the National Trust of Trinidad and Tobago as examples of the \\"city's remarkable architectural heritage.\\" Some of the buildings are in good condition, but others have been in need of repair, like Mille Fleurs, which was beginning to be restored in 2015. This period of construction of the Magnificent Seven occurred just after the turn of the 20th-century, following a \\"disastrous\\" fire of 1895 in Port of Spain, after which non-flammable materials like metal, concrete, and cast iron were used in the construction new buildings. George Brown of the Trinidad Trading Company, who built Mille Fleurs, did much of the rebuilding after the fire and is responsible for much of the metalwork used in the city at that time. Buildings =Queen's Royal College= Queen's Royal College Queen's Royal College, a National Trust of Trinidad and Tobago listed building, was built on the corner of St Clair Avenue and Maraval Road beginning 11 November 1902, when the foundation stone was placed by the acting governor of the day, Sir Courtney Knollys. Daniel Meinerts Hahn, a former student of Queen's Royal College at the Princes Building, designed the German Renaissance style building, which includes a chiming clock and lighted clock tower. He was the chief draughtsman of the Public Works Department. According to the National Trust, \\"Queen's Royal College is considered to be the most striking of the buildings of the Magnificent Seven.\\" The secondary school, designed with a tropical interior, was built with six classrooms and a lecture hall for 500 people. Less than 200 students attended the school each year. As of 2016, the building is being restored, including the classroom's hand-painted murals. It is listed as heritage site and protected under the National Trust Act. =Hayes Court= Hayes Court Hayes Court, at 21 Maraval Road, was built as a residence for the Anglican Bishop to Trinidad. An anonymous gift was made in 1908 by two men to pay for the construction of the building, which was built in a French Colonial architectural style. The design incorporates contemporary Scottish cast iron elements in decorative beams and columns for the veranda, which wrap around all but the west side of the house. On the western fa√ßade of the building are traditional Demerara windows. The mansion was designed by Taylor and Gillies and completed in 1910. The residence was named for Bishop Thomas Hayes, who served as archbishop in Trinidad and Tobago from 1889 to 1904. Right Reverend John Francis Welsh was the first resident. It is listed as heritage site and protected under the National Trust Act. =Mille Fleurs= Mille Fleurs Mille Fleurs at 23 Maraval Road was built and named by the wife of Dr Enrique Prada (1867‚Äì1944) in 1904. Dr Prada oversaw the construction of the French Provincial house by George Brown of the Trinidad Trading Company. The Pradas lived in the house until 1923, when they sold it to Joseph Salvatori. It remained in the family until the Salvatori's daughter, Mrs Pierre Lelong sold it to George Malouk in 1973. He sold it to the government of Trinidad and Tobago in June 1979. It served several purposes over the years and then was under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Culture until June 2000, when it was assigned to the Ministry of Environment. The National Trust states, \\"Although Mille Fleurs is less ostentatious as some of its neighbours, the quality of finish and detailing is perhaps of a far higher quality; the intricately carved balusters and the marble treads and risers to both the main and secondary staircases, the elaborate cast iron columns and brackets.\\" However, after a period of time when it was not occupied or maintained, it has deteriorated significantly. It is listed as a heritage site and protected under the National Trust Act. =Ambard's House= Ambard's House, also known as Roomor House At 25 Maraval Road is Ambard's House, for the French architect Lucien F Ambard who designed and built the French Second Empire style house. He had it constructed in 1904, using wood from the Ambard family estate in Erin for the rafters. He also imported Scottish cast iron elements, Italian marble, and French tiles for its construction. Ambard lost the house to the Gordon Grant and Company in 1919, when he was unable to make the mortgage payments. It was inhabited by an American, William Pettigrew Humphrey, and his family from 1925 to 1940. The house was purchased from Humphrey by Timothy Roodal and it has stayed within the family. It is now the home of Roodal's granddaughter, Dr Yvonne Morgan and her family, and is now also called Roomor House, based upon a combination of the Roodal and Morgan family names. The house has been well-maintained and true to the original design. It is listed as a heritage site and protected under the National Trust Act. =Archbishop's Palace= Archbishop's Palace The Archbishop's House, at 27 Maraval Road, is the official residence of the Archbishop of Port of Spain, which, as of 2016, is The Most Reverend Joseph Everard Harris, CSSP. It was built in 1903 by Patrick Vincent Flood, the Fifth Archbishop of Port of Spain. At that time other residences were being built on Maraval Road by wealthy French Creoles. The building, designed by an Irish architect in an Indian Empire architectural style, had a chapel and sacristy on the first floor. A porch wraps around the building. On the east fa√ßade, there is a porte-coch√®re with wide bay and six additional, narrower bays. The west side has nine bays, and there are six bays on the south and north fa√ßades. The property had a summer house and stables, which was accessed by an extended gallery on the west side of the main building. The construction was completed in 1904 by George Brown of the Trinidad Trading Company. It was remodeled extensively from 1968 to 1969, based upon the architectural design of Sonny Sellier. A chancery was built in the west side of the building and a new apartment was built at the site of a summer house and stables. In some cases, the renovations deviated from the original aesthetic of the architectural design. For instance, aluminum sliding doors replaced the double wooden doors on the ground floor. The contractor was Rev Father Kevin Devenish. Monsignor Anthony Pantin, the first Trinidadian-born Archbishop, lived in the house after the renovation was completed in 1969. It is listed as heritage site and protected under the National Trust Act. =Whitehall= White Hall White Hall, on 29 Maraval Road, is the largest residence on the road. Originally called Rosenweg, it was built by Joseph Leon Agostini, a cocoa planter, based upon his design plans. Agostini's family was from Corsica, and the influence is reflected in the house's Moorish Mediterranean inspired architecture. Construction began in 1904, by James Moore of Barbados, and it took three years to complete the project, except for the roof that was not completed until 1910. The exterior was built using white limestone from Barbados. It was a three-storied building with four reception halls, a library, drawing room, wine cellars, and large galleries. There were six bedroom suites with large dressing rooms and advanced, modern bathrooms. The house had long corridors, wide-sweeping marble staircases, and a service lift between floors. Agostini died in 1906, but his family occupied the house until they were unable to make payments on the mortgage and it was foreclosed by William Gordon Grant in 1910, according to the National Trust. Some believe that the Agostinis never lived in White Hall, because the cocoa industry, which was strong when construction began, collapsed while the house was being built. An American, Robert Henderson, purchased the house and renamed it White Hall, for the coral stone exterior of the building. The National Trust states that he added a \\"delightful variety in the furnishings of the interior was added to the refined dignity of the exterior.\\" Henderson's heirs, the Seigert family, possessed the house until World War II, when it was commandeered by the United States Forces as the Air Raid Precaution headquarters. It was rented for use as a cultural centre by the British Council in 1944. Although it was returned to the Hendersons after the war, they never lived in it again. It was then rented for a number of purposes‚Äîincluding public libraries, National Archives, and Government Broadcasting Unit‚Äîuntil 1949. It was not used again until it was purchased by the Government of Trinidad and Tobago in 1954. It was used by the Pre-Federal Interim Government in 1957, before the formation in 1958 of the West Indies Federation. Hon. Dr. Eric Williams, Trinidad and Tobago's first Prime Minister, used it as the Office of the Prime Minister from 1963 to 2009. During that time, there was a restoration of the building in 2000. It is listed as heritage site and protected under the National Trust Act. Beginning about 2008, the Urban Development Corporation (UDeCOTT) renovated the building so that it could be used by visiting foreign dignitaries. = Stollmeyer's Castle = Stollmeyer's Castle Stollmeyer's Castle, also called Killarney, is a Scottish Baronial style residence located at 31 Maraval Road. Built on land that was previously used as the government stock farm, it was the first residence built in the St Clair neighborhood. It is named for Charles Fourier Stollmeyer, who hired the Scottish architect Robert Gillies to design the house, which is said to be patterned after a wing of Balmoral Castle. The two- year construction project began in 1902. When his wife said that she preferred a simpler home, Stollmeyer gave the house to his son, Conrad. His wife named it for Killarney, Ireland. The property, like White Hall, was commandeered by the United States Forces, who called it \\"The Castle\\", during World War II. It then began to be called Stollmeyer's Castle. After the war, it stayed within the Stollmeyer family until 1972, when it was bought by an insurance executive, Jessy Henry A Mahabir. Seven years later, the government of Trinidad and Tobago owned the building. In the late 1990s, the Citizens for Conservation restored the building. It is under the care of the Office of the Prime Minister, and is a heritage site that is protected under the National Trust Act. A restoration project began in 2008 to ensure that the structure passed updated building codes and was restored for use by visiting foreign dignitaries.

The project, deemed a success after one year, led to a November 1996 vote to establish a public transportation benefit area (PTBA) to fund a permanent system. The vote passed, creating a 0.2 percent sales tax and allowing regular service to begin and expand the following year. The PTBA boundaries were expanded in 1998 to include Quincy, which had opted out of the 1996 vote, thus encompassing all of Grant County. The Grant Transit Authority previously partnered with a local non-profit organization, People for People, for operations but became independent in October 2013. In 2015, construction began on a new transit center in downtown Moses Lake. The transit center opened on August 1, 2017, with an indoor waiting area, a customer service desk, and several bays.

Origin The nomen Laecanius seems to belong to a class of gentilicia formed using the sufix -anius, typically derived from cognomina ending in -anus, or derived from other \\"a-stem\\" words.Chase, p. 118. The name might be derived from the surname Laeca, which was used by a family of the Porcia gens, or from the same root.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 498 (\\"Porcia Gens\\"). Branches and cognomina The only important family of the Laecanii bore the cognomen Bassus, originally indicating someone stout.Chase, p. 110.

The community of Lake Naomi Club is a resort community that includes 1,400 families who own property surrounding Lake Naomi. History In September 1895, a 14-foot (4.3 m) dam was constructed across Tunkhannock Creek and water began backing-up forming \\"Lake Naomi\\", a lake more than a mile long and about one-third of a mile wide. The Ice Company was granted a 99-year lease for \\"the exclusive use of the water and its privileges.\\" It was chartered for the purpose of \\"erecting a dam, for pleasure, boating, skating, fishing and the cutting, storing and selling of ice.\\" In 1902, visitors came from many of the surrounding metropolitan areas including New York City and Philadelphia. In the same year the first bathing beach was created and some lots on the north side of the lake were subdivided and sold to summer cottagers. A sailing camp for girls was set up on the northwest side of the lake. A Lutheran retreat, Lutherland, was erected on the southern side of the lake. The Millers and others utilized southern and eastern sides of the lake for swimming, sailing, skating, fishing. In 1921, a boathouse and beach were constructed on the site of today's Lake Naomi Clubhouse. In 1938, a famous Pennsylvania Supreme Court case took place over who owned the water rights to Lake Naomi, as the surrounding lands were soon owned by many different parties. See Miller v. Lutheran Conference & Camp Ass'n, 331 Pa. 241 (Pa. 1938). In 1963, the Logan Steele family purchased 2,600 acres (11 km2) surrounding the lake which eventually was turned into a resort community called the Lake Naomi Club. Logan Steel died in the 1980s and the club is now owned by its members and run by a board of governors.  Lake Naomi Club  Lake Naomi Club is a recreational community in the Pocono Mountains of Northeastern Pennsylvania. It includes a 277-acre lake with non-motorized boating, fishing, swimming and sailing. Lake Naomi Club also offers an outdoor Olympic-sized pool, a second outdoor pool with an aquatic climbing wall, a nine-hole executive golf course, a tennis center and a clubhouse with restaurant and pub. The recreational staff offers activities for all ages. Additionally, there is a 56,000-square- foot community center with an indoor pool and a splash park, indoor tennis, a fitness center, a game room and a teen area. Climate According to the Trewartha climate classification system, Lake Naomi has a Temperate Continental (Dc) Climate with warm summers (b), cold winters (o) and year- around precipitation. Dcbo climates are characterized by at least one month having an average mean temperature ‚â§ , four to seven months with an average mean temperature ‚â• , all months with an average mean temperature < and no significant precipitation difference between seasons. Although humidity levels are typically comfortable even during the summer months at Lake Naomi, episodes of heat and high humidity can occur with heat index values > . The annual peak in thunderstorm activity is July. During the winter months, the plant hardiness zone is 5b with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of . Episodes of extreme cold and wind can occur with wind chill values < . Ice storms and large snowstorms depositing ‚â• 12 inches (30 cm) of snow are somewhat frequent, particularly during nor‚Äôeasters from December through March. Ecology According to the A. W.

It was hosted by Bonin Bough, with Kumar Arora, Alan Glazen, Kathy Futey, and Jonathan Sawyer as its panel of investors, and Le Bron James making several cameos.

Cleveland had been second on the Distressed Community Index, and fourth on the list of dying cities. CNBC announced that it would \\"help a neighborhood that desperately needs investment\\", and may have assisted Gordon Square's revitalization.

Tapestry Folkdance Center purchased an abandoned structure, the Clayhill Simmer Building, at 3748 Minnehaha Avenue South in Minneapolis in May 1999. The building, which Tapestry's Board president Lisa Strong had observed was for sale while riding her bike, cost $270,000 which was paid for with funds from hundreds of donors. Before housing an air compressor assembly, the building served as a car dealership, evidenced by Ford Model T wheels etched into its exterior. Renovation of the space took place during the summer months of that year and was conducted by over 120 volunteers who collectively spent over 2,000 hours working on the project. Repairing and altering the building to suit Tapestry's needs cost $300,000 which executive director Beth Hennessy characterized as \\"a leap of faith\\" considering the organization's budget of under $100,000. Alterations made to the structure included the installation of wooden dance floors and an electrical sound system, the addition of a new HVAC system, and construction of a lounge, offices, and classrooms. A grand opening with a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held on October 16, 1999. Shortly after opening, attendance at the new space was 160, higher than the 85‚Äì100 dancers who typically danced with the group at Sabathani. Programming and operations Tapestry offers lessons in and gatherings for Scandinavian dance, swing dance, English country dance, contra dance, Bollywood dance, and Romani dance. Dance events tend to include a lesson during the half hour before the dance begins and many of the dances are called. The space is rented by outside organizations for meetings, dance rehearsals, and music lessons. City Pages named Tapestry the best place to learn to dance in the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul area in 2000 and 2001. Tapestry is a non-profit organization sustained via membership. As of 2015, the center had approximately 350 members who served on a volunteer basis as planners for the center's dancer, ticket-takers, and fund-raisers. In 2015, Tapestry was led by executive director Mary Cummings.

Settlement in the colonies Between 1700 and 1775, the overwhelming majority of settlers in the colonies (around 75%) were Britons of varying ethnic backgrounds such as English, Welsh, Scottish and Scots-Irish, with initial settlements focused on the colonial hearths of Virginia, New England and Bermuda, under Elizabeth I of England, James VI and I and Charles I of England.

Steinbrecher and mother Helen Clara (Siska) Steinbrecher. He was an American astrologer, lecturer, teacher, metaphysician and an astrological data collector, noted for works related to meditation and his precise Steinbrecher Collection, entered on John Woodsmall's Pathfinder Program. He taught and lectured on the occult sciences, specifically in relation to practising meditation and wrote the book titled, The Inner Guide to Meditation. The book has been referred in works of authors, in their books on esoteric subjects, meditation and intuition . Biography Steinbrecher was born in Chicago, Illinois. He was raised in a family of astrologers, including his mother, several aunts and uncles. He learned the language of astrology from the age of five and took classes with his aunt and godmother, Josephine Siska. A restless youth, he joined the Army as a conscientious objector, serving in the medical corps. On April 23, 1953, he volunteered for experiments in lowering body temperature, in order that army medics could find how best to readjust the temperature of soldiers after freezing-trauma. During the procedure, he \\"flat-lined\\" in an NDE. During the few minutes when he was clinically dead, he experienced such bliss that it changed him forever and affirmed his life direction. He founded D.O.M.E., the Inner Guide Meditation Center, in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1975. The center moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1984. Steinbrecher died of emphysema on January 26, 2002. Shortly before his death, he sold his data collection to Lois Rodden's Astrodatabank, where his collection was completely integrated. His collection of original birth records has been scanned by the current owner of Astrodatabank, the Swiss company Astrodienst AG, in 2014, and is available to researchers in PDF firmat. Personal life Ed married Suzanne Gross on June 17, 1955. Suzanne May Gross and Edwin Charles Steinbrecher exchanged marriage vows in St. Mary's rectory Saturday afternoon. They later divorced.

She is a leading researcher with a major research focus on viral infections in children, and the testing of rotaviral vaccines. She also works on other enteric infections and their consequences when children are infected in early life, sanitation and water safety. She was awarded the prestigious Infosys Prize in Life Sciences in 2016 for her contributions to understanding the natural history of rotavirus and other infectious diseases. In 2019, she became the first Indian woman to be elected as a Royal Society Fellow. Early life and education Gagandeep Kang grew up moving around north and east India, changing schools 10 times. She practiced science frequently at home during her childhood, building a lab with her father at home when she was 12 and experimenting by cutting up leaves then observing them through a microscope. Gagandeep Kang completed her Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) in 1987 and her Doctor of Medicine (MD) in Microbiology in 1991 from Christian Medical College, Vellore and obtained her PhD in 1998. She obtained her membership of the Royal College of Pathologists and carried out postdoctoral research with Mary K. Estes at the Baylor College of Medicine, Houston before returning to the Christian Medical College.  Career and research  Kang is a medical scientist who has worked on diarrhoea diseases and public health in India since the early 1990s. She is a key contributor to rotavirus epidemiology and vaccinology in India. Focusing on vaccines, enteric infections and nutrition in young children in disadvantaged communities, she has combined field epidemiology with intensive laboratory investigations to inform both the science of infectious diseases and policy in India. Her comprehensive research on rotavirus has demonstrated the high burden of rotavirus disease across India, the genetic diversity of viruses, the lower protection from infection and vaccines and the exploration of several approaches to improve the performance of oral vaccines. Her work has led to her being described as India's \\"vaccine godmother\\". She has published over 300 scientific papers and is on editorial boards for several journals, including PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases, Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine and International Health. She is on many review committees for national and international research funding agencies, and has served on several advisory committees mainly related to vaccines, including India's National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, the WHO's Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety and the Immunisation and Vaccine Implementation Research Advisory Committee. She chairs the WHO SEAR's Regional Immunisation Technical Advisory Group (2015‚Äìpresent). She has received honorary appointments as an associate faculty member at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland and adjunct professor at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, Massachusetts. Kang played a significant role in the efforts that culminated in the development of Rotavac, a vaccine from Bharat Biotech International that targets diarrhea. She was one of three principal investigators in the Phase III clinical trials of the vaccine. Her initial interest was in identifying the correlates of protection against the rotavirus. She and others began by recreating a study conducted in Mexico to identify children protected from rotaviral infection, research the immune responses and isolate the correlate of protection. The recreated study itself did not succeed, but it did develop high quality laboratory methods for the detection of rotaviruses. Kang and one of her students subsequently established vaccine assays for rotavirus infections, used in testing Rotavac. =Awards and honours= She is the first Indian woman scientist to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 359 years of history of this prestigious scientific academy.

It is used by some to refer exclusively to anglophone Canadians with British immigrant ancestors, but it usually refers to either anglophone or francophone Canadians as parallel old stock groups. Francophone Canadians descended from early French immigrants in New France (prior to the loss of Quebec to the British in 1763) are sometimes referred to as Qu√©b√©cois pure laine, often translated as \\"dyed in the wool\\", but with the same connotation as old stock. Definition and use Elaine Elke defines old stock Canadians as, \\"white, Christian and English speaking.\\" Richard Bourhis, however, regards both Anglophone and Francophone Canadians as old stock, reporting that large number of both groups self-describe their ethnicity as \\"Canadian,\\" although he states that many Canadians associate the term with Anglophone identity. Boyd and Norris concur in finding that Canadians primarily associate the term with Anglophone identity.Boyd, M. and Norris, D. (2001). Who are the \\"Canadians\\"?: Changing census responses, 1986-1996. Canadian Ethnic Studies/Etudes ethniques au Canada, 33, 1, 1-24. While the term can refer to Canadians who are descendants of immigrants who have lived in the country for one or more generations as then PM Stephen Harper said in 2015, it is most typically applied to those whose families were originally from France or Britain. For example, Liberal MP St√©phane Dion used the term in 2014 in the following manner: Individuals of Francophone descent who self-describe as \\"old stock\\" include journalist Lysiane Gagnon, \\"I am an old-stock Canadian whose ancestor, Mathurin Gagnon, came to Canada in 1640 from a small farming community in the western part of Normandy.\\" She describes \\"old stock\\" as \\"those who came from France in the early 17th century and a much smaller group who came from Great Britain in the wake of the 1759 British Conquest.\\" She explains that, \\"There's never been, in my family, stories or recollections of another kind of life on another continent or memories of an exodus. My forebears never knew another country than Canada. They never had another native language than French. They never cooked meals that were different from their neighbour's. They never had a wide network of cousins in faraway places. As a child, the most 'different' persons I had in my family circle were a Scottish aunt and a few Irish cousins. Coming from an old-stock background (which is the case of 80 per cent of Quebeckers) shapes your personality and influences your views ‚Äì not always for the best...\\" According to Gagnon, \\"Old-stock francophones used to call themselves \\"French-Canadians\\" (with a hyphen),\\" but the term has passed out of fashion. Journalist Tu Thanh Ha concurs. Now they will call themselves Quebecois, as they consider themselves as a distinguished ethnic group of Canada. According to sociolinguist Charles Boberg, while most Canadians reporting their ethnicity in the 2000 census as \\"Canadian\\" were \\"old stock\\" descendants of French or British immigrant ancestors, descendants of 20th century Welsh, American, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Irish or Scots ancestors were more likely to consider themselves as Canadian, than those of Chinese, Filipino, East Indian, Portuguese, Greek, Vietnamese, or Jamaican descent, indicating that northern Europeans assimilated with old stock Canadians more readily than other groups. Some writers describe the effort to construct a Canadian identity encompassing First Nations peoples, old stock Francophones and Anglophones, and recent immigrants and their Canada-born descendants. During discussions about Quebec's demands to be labelled a \\"distinct society\\", then Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau said that the Province's attempt was a racist concept that would make \\"second- or third- class citizens of everyone but 'old stock' Quebecers.\\" Justin Trudeau Controversy In 2007, Justin Trudeau (now Prime Minister), who was then a candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada, raised the ire of some commentators for using \\"old stock canadian\\" during an interview, dismissing Quebec's claim of being a \\"nation\\". He asked: \\"...whether everyone in Quebec was part of that nation, or just the ‚Äúold stock‚Äù pioneers.\\" In a later speech to the University Club about the distinctiveness of Quebec, he clarified: \\"In the sociological sense of the term we can talk about the nation of Quebec or Quebec as a nation.\\" Harper controversy In the 2015 federal election campaign in Canada, which was taking place against the backdrop of hundreds of thousands of refugees of the Syrian Civil War (2011-) fleeing to Europe, then Prime Minister Stephen Harper's use of the appellation 'Old Stock Canadians' created a media frenzy. Harper explained (in reference to a debate on health care policy): \\"I know that that is a position supported widely through the Canadian population, it's supported by Canadians who are themselves immigrants and also supported by the rest of us, by Canadians who have been the descendants of immigrants for one or more generations.\\" Social researcher Frank Graves, founder and current president of EKOS Research Associates Inc. described the use of the term 'old- stock Canadians' as a deliberate strategy called dog-whistle politics, a term that originated in Australian politics in the mid-1990s, which was used by John Howard in his successful political campaignGrant Barrett, The official dictionary of unofficial English, McGraw-Hill Professional, 2006, p. 90 under the direction of Lynton Crosby. Crosby was retained by Harper in September 2015. Graves claimed that this was a \\"deliberate strategy \\"to energize the Conservative base' and to sort them from the rest of the electorate. It creates a sense of us versus others.\\" The 'dog-whistle' message analogy refers to the way in which a political message, which may in effect be exclusionary, distasteful and even racist, reactionary or inflammatory to some, is not understood as such by those outside the target subgroup of the electorate. The message resonates and energizes this target group and is misheard or misunderstood by others, just as the high pitched sound of the dog whistle is not heard except by dogs. Tu Thanh Ha linked the phrase not only to \\"Qu√©b√©cois de souche\\" but also to Prime Minister Harper's recent hiring of \\"Lynton Crosby, who is known to win elections against great odds in Australia where he masterminded the successful General Election victories for the former Australian prime minister John Howard, in 1998 and 2001 and Britain by using \\"emotionally-charged campaigning tactics.\\" In Canada divisive polarizing issues include \\"the ban the niqƒÅb from citizenship ceremonies and \\"raising fears about terrorism.\\" Tu Thanh Ha claims that Harper was trying to pitch to minority voters \\"by drawing a line between the law-abiding ones, whose social values also happened to be conservative, and the others, those who were portrayed as queue-jumping terrorist-sympathizing bogus asylum seekers.\\" In an interview with the Toronto Star George Elliott Clarke, a Canadian poet and playwright and a 7th-generation descendant of black refugees of the War of 1812, said, See also * European colonization of the Americas * Pure laine References Ethnic groups in Canada Canadian political phrases Racism in Canada ","title":"Old Stock Canadians"},{"id":"51085218","text":"Sandhya Srikant Visweswariah is a scientist and academic at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India.

Geography Kiah Creek originates in Lincoln County. Its largest tributaries are Francis Fork/Creek, Rollem Fork, Trough Fork, Big Laurel Fork, and Cove Fork/Creek. Its entire headwaters are located in Lincoln County, while its lower regions lie in Wayne County. History Anglo settlers arrived on Kiah Creek prior to 1820. Among the earliest families were Wileys, Maynards, and Queens. During the Civil War, Big Laurel Fork hosted a skirmish between Union Colonel George W. Gallup's 14th Regiment Kentucky Volunteer Infantry (275 foot soldiers) and 39th Regiment Kentucky Volunteer Infantry (150 mounted soldiers) and Confederate Colonel Milton J. Ferguson's 16th Virginia Cavalry. Fought on the morning of 15 February 1864, Gallup's troops won a victory over Ferguson's surprised rebels, killing 10, wounding several, and releasing 16 federal prisoners. Additionally, Gallup's Kentuckians captured Col. Ferguson, his surgeon, two lieutenants, and 38 non-commissioned officers and privates. Since 1869, at least four post offices have been located on or in the vicinity of Kiah Creek. On 17 May 1869, Walter Queen became postmaster of Cove Creek Post Office. This post office was discontinued in 1912. On 10 January 1877, John McCoy became postmaster at Cove Gap Post Office, situated in the head of Cove Creek/Fork. This post office was discontinued sometime after 1921. On 16 June 1884, Joshua Queen became postmaster of Kiahsville Post Office. Kiahsville Post Office still exists. On 16 June 1884, Louis Queen became postmaster of Queens Ridge Post Office. This post office was discontinued after 1917. Economy From the earliest of times, timbering served as the creek's major industry. After the Civil War, large-scale timbering permeated the creek. Since the twentieth century, Kiah Creek has hosted major coal mining activity. Religion The New Salem Old Regular Baptist Church is located on Big Laurel Fork of Kiah Creek. The Kiah's Creek [United Baptist] Church was formed and located on Kiah's Creek for over a hundred years. The church was formed in 1848 and was a founding church of two different United Baptist Associations that offered religious services in the area: Zion Association in 1848, and then Bethlehem which came out of Zion, in 1871. The Kiah's Creek Church started with less than thirty members but had well over 200 members by the 1970s. As of 2019 it has about 30 members once more. The current location of the church is in Lincoln County, having moved there when the East Lynn Lake was put in, and the old property sold to the government. The Kiah's Creek and surrounding churches (oftentimes named after the creek or area) have been active in these areas for over a hundred years. Many of them originated in the Bethlehem Association of United Baptists. The pronunciation of the church and creek is \\"Car's Creek\\" in the older vernacular.

Life Intra was born in Auckland in 1968 and grew up in Turangi, a small town in the centre of New Zealand's North Island, and Auckland where he attended Dilworth, a boy's school. He studied at the University of Auckland's Elam School of Fine Arts, completing a Bachelor of Fine Arts with a major in sculpture in 1990 and a Master of Fine Art in 1993. Curator Robert Leonard has described him as a 'precocious student': he established a reputation as a conceptual painter while still in his teens. Intra was fascinated by Surrealist photography, such as the work of Jacques-Andr√© Boiffard, who was also a medical photographer. In his art work he investigated medicine, which he saw to have replaced religion as a source of hope for modern day society, and the frailties of the human body.. His early work integrated ideas about culture text and body from non-Western sources; some of which were derived from his travels in India c. 1988. His use of text, voice and typography presages his later engagement with theory and criticism. Intra became part of a collective of artists that established the influential Auckland artist-run space Teststrip in 1992. In 1996 Intra was awarded a Fulbright scholarship and travelled to Los Angeles to study at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. He completed a master's degree in Critical Studies in 2001. His thesis was based on Daniel Paul Schreber's 1903 book Memoirs of My Nervous Illness (1903), and used texts by artists including Salvador Dal√≠ and Robert Smithson to \\"suggest ways that art writing might be reinvented.\\" Writing Intra began writing about art for a magazine named Stamp while at art school in Auckland. At the time of his death Intra was West Coast editor for Art and Text, and helped edit the magazine Semiotext; his writing was published in Tema Celeste, Artforum, Bookforum and Flash Art. China Art Objects In 1998 Intra and fellow art student Steve Hanson, who Intra worked with in the library at the Art Center, decided to start an artist-run gallery. They found a location in Los Angeles' Chinatown district and named the gallery China Art Objects, after a sign left by a previous tenant. The gallery opened in January 1999 and was the beginning of the transformation of Chung King Road as a contemporary art scene. China Art Objects became an influential dealer gallery, an early supporter of a number of Los Angeles artists. Death Intra died in Manhattan in December 2002, on a visit for the opening of an exhibition by one of China Art Objects' artists. In an obituary for Frieze Will Bradley wrote that Intra would be remembered \\"for his achievements as an artist, writer and co-founder of China Art Objects Galleries in Los Angeles, and equally for his enthusiasm, intelligence, integrity, warmth and all-around obvious decency\\". In 2007 Intra's mother donated his archives to the Auckland Art Gallery. An exhibition based on the archive, Beginning in the Archive: Giovanni Intra 1968-2002, curated by Kate Brettkelly Chalmers, was staged at the Auckland gallery Artspace in 2008.

Bhandari is pursuing her study on signal transduction in biological systems, with particular emphasis on understanding the role of inositol pyrophosphates in physiology and metabolism. Education Bhandari obtained her bachelor's degree in Human Biology from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, followed by post graduation and doctorate in Biological Sciences from the Indian Institute of Science. Career Bhandari joined Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics in 2008 as a Staff Scientist. Post her doctorate at Indian Institute of Science, Bhandari worked with Sandhya Srikant Visweswariah on signal transduction by the membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase, GCC, which is involved in maintaining fluid and ion homeostasis across the intestinal membrane. In 2001, Bhandari joined John Kuriyan laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley as a post-doctoral fellow to work on the structural biology and biochemistry of proteins involved in cell signaling. In 2003, Bhandari relocated to the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, where she worked with Solomon Snyder on deciphering the role of inositol pyrophosphates as signalling molecules. In 2015, a group led by Bhandari found that mice with lower levels of IP7 show reduced blood clotting. Inadequate levels of IP7 led to reduction in another phosphate-rich molecule called polyphosphate (a long chain of phosphate groups linked to each other). In mammals, polyphosphate is predominantly found in platelets and helps in strengthening blood clots during their formation. Polyphosphates housed inside platelets break up during clotting. These polyphosphates and other components get released to form a mesh that constitutes the basic structure for clot. Lowering IP7 levels could have potential applications in the prevention of stroke or myocardial infarction by reducing clotting. Bhandari believes that ambition leads to success and not gender.

Plot Opening quote: \\"If a man of pure heart were to fall in love with her, that would bring her back to life.\\" Nick (David Giuntoli) is attacked by Marnassier (Mike Dopud). He is saved by Kelly (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), who kills him. They then race to the hospital where Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) and Rosalee (Bree Turner) have developed a cure for Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch). Nick administers the cure on Juliette. While investigating the murders of Marnassier and the agents, one of the investigators discovers a phone and discovers that Nick was the last person one of the agents called. They then place Nick under arrest for suspicion in the murder of the agents. However, they release him as there is not enough evidence. Meanwhile, Catherine (Jessica Tuck) gives Renard (Sasha Roiz) a potion for him to ingest in order to wake Juliette. Kelly confronts Catherine, accusing her of conspiring with Adalind in Juliette's condition and they fight, which culminates when Kelly kills Catherine. Meanwhile, Renard drinks the potion and suffers a painful breakdown. He then finally heals and goes to the hospital where he kisses Juliette. After he leaves, Juliette wakes up.

'The Kiss' is the second half of a two-part story, and it instills a little more faith that despite some serious rocky patches, Grimm has a vague idea of where it's going. It may not always deal directly with the overarching mythology ‚Äî one of the writers confirmed via Twitter that the case-of-the-week structure is returning ‚Äî but it can stretch out a story over two weeks and make it reasonably interesting.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.5 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"It's too bad NBC didn't premiere Grimm with back-to-back episodes.

This made him Duke of Halluin, but Henry de Nogaret de La Valette also kept his title, which led to complicated situations at the French Court. Anne died without children in November 1641.

Early life Myrtle Watkins, born, Myrtle Dillard in Birmingham, Alabama, in June 1908 as the fifth child of Betty S. and Jasper L. Dillard. A 1910 Alabama Census confirms this information. Her father ran a grocery store (J. L. Dillard's Fish Co,) in Birmingham. Myrtle appears in Baltimore mid-1925, 17 years old as a dancer with her partner Yank Brunson. The Baltimore Afro-American newspaper described her as a local entertainer. Eventually, in late 1925, she joins Eddie Lemon's Stock Company, appearing at the Regent Theater's Who Dat? revue. Early in 1926, after Eddie Lemon left for Philadelphia, she remained at the Regent as part of the cast of Lew Peyton's Brownskin Vamps, where she appeared in her own solo number dancing the Charleston. During this time, Myrtle met and married local mechanic, Cephus Watkins; however, the marriage ended shortly afterwards. The following month, she was entertaining at the 'all- white' Folly Cabaret in East Baltimore, her Charleston had caught on immensely with its patrons. Weeks later, she departed for Boston with the Rarin' to Go revue. In 1928, she toured around the Boston area with the Bostonian Harmony Lads singing light blues, where she wrote in the Afro-American that she missed Baltimore. Career =Arrival in Europe= During the winter of 1928, she joined the cast of the 2nd version of Lew Leslie's Blackbirds during the Boston auditions. She eventually met Eddie Thompson, one of the show's leading dancers and part of the duo Worthy & Thompson. Myrtle and Eddie returned briefly to New York (February 4, 1929) to marry, another brief marriage. Blackbirds continued touring the Eastern US until May 31, when the troupe boarded the SS Ile de France for France. There they played three months the Moulin Rouge, before the French director renovated the Moulin into a cinema. The show opened on June 7 and was a sensation. Some of France's top stars attended, including Mistinguett and Maurice Chevalier. Adelaide Hall was the star attraction, and replacing Bill Bojangles Robinson in this version were, John Worthy and Ed Thompson. Blackbirds returned to New York to briefly tour the East Coast again in September, but its return coincided with the famous Wall-Street Crash and there was no work. In April 1930, the United States Census takers arrived at the Thompson residence on 7th Avenue, where Mrs. Myrtle Thompson mentioned that she was employed as a entertainer with origins in Alabama. Weeks later, while engaged at Harlem's Lennox Club, Afro-American songwriter, Eugene Newton, whom had previously opened a Parisian nightclub in 1929, had plans of opening a new cabaret in the French capital, and organized Newton's Chocolate Revue as his main act. While Eddie Thompson was away touring across America, Myrtle returned to France the revue, arriving around April 26th, the show was promptly reorganized with the help of Eugene Bullard and S.H. Dudley Jr. before preparing for its opening a week later. On May 1st, the Comedy Club Revue, opened at Gene Newton's Le Comedy Club, where the production ran for several weeks before the establishment was shut down by French authorities. On the 24th, the cast moved over to Eugene Bullard's Embassy Club as, Revue Noire: Hot Stuff, featuring headliners Louis Cole, Elisabeth Welch, Lillian Brown and comic Snow Fisher. On May 31, Louis Cole, Elisabeth Welch, Myrtle Watkins and Senegalese Folies-Bergere star, F√©ral Benga were entertaining at the Enfants-Terribles Restaurant, quickly become a popular attraction. On June 23rd, an artistic gala was held at the Enfants- Terribles, Myrtle performing alongside Lucienne Boyer, Alina de Silva, the Irving Sisters, Charpini and Brancato, M. Pisella to the sound of Pance Lowry's orchestra. For the remainder of the summer, Myrtle teamed up with Elisabeth Welch appearing at the famous supper club, Chez Florence in long orange satin gowns designed by Jean Patou, lifting their skirts to reveal their long legs as they danced. A while later, she appeared again at the Embassy with the show Ebony Follies. By late 1930, afternmost of the cast at the Embassy had already returned to America, Myrtle began appearing the Champs-Elysees Nightclub, but eventually soon made her way southwest for Spain. =Spain (1930‚Äì33)= Myrtle probably arrived in Spain that winter, as she opened in Madrid on January 6th, 1931 with her Red Hot Coals Jazz Orchestra at the Lido de Madrid Cabaret (underneath the Teatro Alc√°zar) located on Calle de Alcal√° 20. Her arrival was probably organized by Spanish author and lyricist, Alvaro Retana, who was known for introducing black jazz entertainers into Spain. Retana mentioned in his memoirs later that Mytle performed semi-nude, imitating the Spanish dancer Carmen Tortola Valencia, under the name Perla de Oriente. On March 7th, her contract ended at the Lido and Myrtle traveled south to Seville's Casino del Exposicion, where she was entertaining when the Spanish monarchy ended on April 14th as Niceto Alcal√°- Zamora y Torres was declared the president and former King Alfonso XIII abdicated peacefully and boarded a train to France for exile. In May, she returned triumphantly to Madrid's Lido as celebrations filled the streets. On June 6th, she was entertaining at the Sala Metropolitano, three days later she moved over to the Ideals-Rosales open-air cabaret performing with Carlos VG Flores' Orchestra until July 6th. It was during this engagement she was introduced to Argentine singer-guitarist Alfredo Marino (born January 30th, 1904) and his partner, Hector Morel. Once her contract ended at the Ideal- Rosales, Myrtle joined the duo on a tour across Spain's northern coast in cities such as Bilbao, Oviedo and San Sebasti√°n. Upon returning to Madrid on July 22nd, she appeared at the Casanova en Stambul cabaret alongside Manuel Pizarro's Argentina Orchestra for three days. On August 11th, Myrtle appeared at the Dancing Retiro, a nightclub located in Madrid's lush Parque del Buen Retiro alongside popular Afro-American bandleader Harry Flemming and his orchestra. Two days later, she reunited with Morel & Marino and together they performed at the Teatro Alkazar in a magnificent stage show for six weeks. On October 2nd, Myrtle appeared at the Circo Price for three days before boarding a train to Barcelona. Not long after arriving, she made several appearances on Spanish radio and recording several songs for the Compa√±√≠a del Gram√≥fono- Barcelona. None of the recordings seem to have survived, however she was noted as performing El Manisero and other popular Cuban rumbas and Spanish pasodoble toreros around this time. On the 27th, together with Afro-American dancer, Josephine Wynn (who she met months earlier at the Retiro) opened at the popular Eden Concert musichall, where they performed a successful month. On November 8th, Myrtle participated in the Fiesta Parisina at the Eden Concert alongside, Afro-Uruguayan singer Oscar Rorra, known under stage name: Caruso Negro. On the 17th, at the Teatro Novedades, she performed in a benefit for Barcelona's firefighters. On November 21st, Myrtle participated in an eight- day variety spectacle held at the Circo Barcelones, alongside some Spain's top entertainers. On December 16th, Myrtle appeared with Afro-American dancer Jimmy Holmes at the Buena Sombra cabaret until February 3rd. From February 28th until March 16th 1932, she performed with Afro-American bandleader Levi Wine's Revista Americana, which included popular Spanish cabaret artist, Bella Dorita, at the Ba-Ta-Clan in Valencia. Returning to Madrid a week later and establishing a residence at the Hotel Florida, on March 24th (or April 4th), she opened at Lido de Madrid with Louis Douglas's company, where they were engaged throughout the month. Afterhours, Myrtle would drive over to the Teatro Fuencarral, where she also appeared in Folkoricos Arrevistados, alongside Argentinean actress Perlita Greco and Rosarillo de Triana. Early May, while Louis Douglas recovered in a local hospital with stomach pains, together with dancer, Scrappy Jones, he reorganized the company from his bed. On May 21st, Modern Melodies opened at the Avenida Cinema dancing in front of the band in a costume with red feathers swinging on her backside. One visiting journalist for the Afro-American described her as the Josephine Baker of Spain: \\"Miss Watkins is a very good dancer, with plenty of pep, and a pretty shapely figure. She is making conquests in high society and on her string is the marquis of one of Spain's bluest blue bloods. She lives at the Hotel Florida, one of the best hotels in the city, has a fine roadster, records for Spanish gramophone and radio, and entertains at one of the leading cabarets.\\" The revue closed on June 16th and Louis Douglas took the company over to another theater. It's unknown if Myrtle joined them. On July 14th, Myrtle and Josephine Wynn traveled to the city of Zaragoza to appear for three weeks at the Florida Bar. On October 4th, Spanish newspapers reported that an upcoming film, titled Movietone 1933, was under preparation at a Madrid film studio. The film was to feature Perlita Greco, Myrtle, Scrappy Jones and several other Spanish actors. However it's unknown whether the film actually materialized. On the 13th, Myrtle was in the city of Huesca, appearing at the Cine Odeon with Cuban saxophonist, El Negro Aquilino and his band. In December, Louis Douglas and his troupe departed for what would be a failed Italian Tour. It's not known whether Myrtle actually accompanied him, as she disappears for several months. She may have probably spent this time appearing in various Spanish provinces. On January 10th, 1933, Myrtle resurfaced in Andalucia, appearing at Seville's Teatro del Duque. On the 21st, she was in the nearby city of Huelva engaged at the Teatro Mora. A while later, on March 9th, she appeared back in Seville at the Pathe Cinema for four days. In June 1933, she was touring Belgium with the bandleader Robert de Kers. While there, she recorded a new song, Lonely Brown Rose (which was also translated to French as Rose Creole) and appeared on the front of Belgian magazines. Returning to Spain during the fall, she opened on September 15th at Barcelona's Teatro Romea in Max Guido's Jazz Show revue for two magnificent weeks. On October 7th, she moved over to the glamourous Pompeya Musichall where she danced all evening for a month, and then after midnight would run down the street and sing at the popular Hollywood nightclub which would be broadcast floorshows over the radio. There at the Hollywood, she performed alongside her latest rival, 17 year old, Elsie Bayron, who although had been born in Puerto Rico, she had grew up in Harlem and was showcasing her repertoire from the Savoy Ballroom everynight in Barcelona's popular nightclubs. On November 17th, Myrtle appeared at the exclusive Casa Llibre Tea Rooms singing for some of Spain‚Äôs elite. That winter, Myrtle paired up with Afro-American pianist Tommy Puss Chase and his band for a tour of the southern coast of France. \\"Myrtle Watkins was a very enterprising girl, always had some kind of band with her, and was a very good looking and talented singer and dancer.\\" They appeared in Cannes, Nice and ended in Monaco during the Rallye Monte Carlo. =European tour (1934‚Äì36)= On March 11th, 1934, Ada Bricktop Smith postponed the opening of her new Parisian nightclub, Monico's, until Myrtle arrived, advertised her as \\"the world‚Äôs most fascinating entertainer\\". After three months, on June 2nd, she moved on to the Basque Bar with entertainer Evelyn Dove. On July 2nd, Myrtle debuted in London's Granada Theater ‚Äòall-colored‚Äô revue, Black Scandals. The show ran for a successful week. The films shown that week on the manager‚Äôs weekly report states that both films were rather weak, and had it not been for the stage show, the takings would have been down. On July 14th, for the remainder of the month, newspapers reported that Myrtle returned home to Spain to handle affairs. On August 25th, she was in The Netherlands, dancing in The Hague at the popular Palais de Danse cabaret with French singer, Marie Dubas. On November 3rd, Myrtle was appearing at London's Cafe Anglais with Louis Simmonds' Orchestra. On January 31st, 1935, she returned to Paris, appearing at the popular Cuban-themed Melody-Bar with the Afro-American tenor, Opal Cooper. While there, she learned her estranged husband Eddie was ill with stomach cancer and had to halt his career while recovering in hospital. In March, she left for Berlin to appear in a film before returning in May, appearing at the Boeuf Sur Le Toit with Leon Abbey's orchestra. While touring Belgium again during the late summer, Leon Abbey arranged for Myrtle to appear with his orchestra for six months in Bombay, India. After boarding a ship in Venice, they arrived in Bombay early October, where it was quickly realized they didn't have the proper work permits. Later joined by Opal Cooper, the group appeared at the Taj Mahal Hotel and Green's Ballroom next door with much success. By December, however, Myrtle was laid low by a terrible bout of malaria. During her stay, she was introduced to a handsome Malaysian cricket player, Lall Singh, who was smitten with this new popular jazz artist in India. Lall Singh was born, December 16th, 1909 into the affluent Gill Jat family of Malaya, who had migrated there from India 3 generations before. He was the youngest of 3 sons, the eldest being Santha Singh Gill and middle brother being Bishen Singh Gill. All three brothers studied at the prestigious Victoria Institute in Kuala Lumpur. Being highly passionate to play cricket at the highest possible level, he convinced his mother to allow and sponsor him to play cricket in India. The family accordingly approached Maharajah Patiala, Bhupindar Singh who was known to the family. Maharajah Bhupindir Singh, himself a good cricketer and lover of the game, advised the family to send Lall Singh to Patiala to play in his team, Maharajah Patiala XI, which was led by the Maharajah himself. He reached Patiala in 1931 and in the company of Maharajah Bupindar Singh developed his lifelong love for the 'Patiala Peg'. The following year, Lall was selected for India's inaugural tour to England. In 1934-35, Lall Singh represented Hindus in the Bombay Quadrangular tournament and South Punjab in the inaugural Ranji Trophy. Maharajah Bhupindar Singh was very fond of Lall and this closeness to the Maharajah gave rise to many enemies, as a result of which, there was an attempt on the life of Lall Singh in 1936. He was seriously injured but survived. By March of 1936, after recovery, with the permission of Maharajah Bhupindar Singh, Lall took a short break from cricket and returned to Europe with Myrtle, now working as her theatrical agent. Soon after, the couple quickly wed and Myrtle began wearing a sari and practicing Sikhism alongside her new husband. Around this time, her former husband in Harlem died of Stomach Cancer. Throughout the spring, Myrtle appeared in Egypt and Greece. In June, she arrived in Turkey, performing at Istanbul's Taksim Bahcesi club (June 3-19), located on Taksim Square. After travelling across Bulgaria, Romania and Yugoslavia, Myrtle arrived in Czechoslovakia to perform at Prague's Savarin Cabaret (October 1-2) before moving on to Hungary. On November 1st, Amerika Revu Kultura opened at Budapest's famous Arizona Csodab√°r, on of the most celebrated nightclubs in the Hungarian capital. While guests danced on the rotating dance floor and chorus girls were perched on mechanical chandeliers that descended from the ceiling, Myrtle was one the leading \\"African\\" stars of this multicultural show. After the revue closed, Myrtle went over to the Negresco Caf√© for the remainder of the winter (December 2-January 5). =Transition into Paquita (1937‚Äì40)= Unable to return home to Spain, due to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, she instead traveled back to Paris the spring of 1937 in time for the Exposition Internationale, appearing at Le Grand Jeu Cabaret and the George V Restaurant where she held live-radio broadcasts and performed for every visiting dignitary and royalty at the Exposition. She was soon accompanied by Samuel Bonifacio Zarate, a Mexican violinist popular among French audiences for his virtuoso violin skills. He worked with Carlos Ch√°vez's Sinf√≥nica de Mexico at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City and graduated from the Mexican National Conservatory, where he was a disciple of Luis G. Saloma. He earned a scholarship from the Mexican government and studied in Paris at the l'Ecole Normale Superieur (1932‚Äì37). Earlier in the spring, he won the first prize at the International Violin Competition. To make ends meet, he entertained whenever possible, often with the Mexican-American Vedette, Reva Reyes. On one occasion, he was hired to entertain royalty at the George V restaurant. There he met Myrtle, who soon took on the name Paquita, and quickly became a musical team. In September, they moved over to the Pavillon-Elysees and spent the winter at the Villa d'Este cabaret. In June 1938, Adelaide Hall left for London, leaving behind her cabaret, the Big Apple Club. Myrtle became the club's main attraction while Bricktop ran the finances of the club. But Bricktop was no good in keeping the accounts straight, her temper was even worse, and soon the cabaret shut down that winter. Before the club fell apart, Myrtle returned to the Villa d'Este in September. In December, she appeared in Harlem au Coliseum at the Paris-Coliseum alongside other artists, such as her new partner Samuel Zarate and Zaidee Jackson. She later opened at the new Park-Lane Club with Louis Armstrong & his Cuban American orchestra. During the summer of 1939, while Myrtle and Zarate toured the Baltic coast, where her German films did so well, when the atmosphere suddenly grew dark in Europe. Posters appeared across everywhere \\"Because of the aggressive attitude of the German government, France and the United Kingdom has declared a general mobilization.\\" In August, she was in Poland appearing on Radio-Warsaw. A few weeks later, Polish musician, Stanley Laudan invited Myrtle to, La Bagatelle, his club in Katowice. On September 1, World War II started as Nazi troops quickly seized Poland. As Poland underwent military mobilization to defend itself, she was able to get documents to flee back to Paris. Upon arriving, Lall decided to renew his cricket contract and return to Malaysia and at some point couple probably decided to divorce in November. Soon as danger was at her doorstep again as the Germans turned their attentions on France early 1940. =India (1941‚Äì43)= Danger was again at their doorstep as the Germans turned their attentions on France early 1940, Paquita and Zarate departed for a Middle Eastern tour, travelling across Egypt and Iraq during the early years of the war. By the summer of 1941, they made their way into India, with major success in Lahore's Hotel as well as Bombay's Taj Mahal and Green's Hotels. This attracted the attention from Calcutta's Grand Hotel which housed the popular American jazz musician, Teddy Weatherford, whom she met briefly in 1937 and who had just arrived from Ceylon and was now the music director of the hotel's ballroom. In November, the Grand Ballroom floor-show featured Myrtle dancing and singing Latin American numbers. She was soon broadcast over Indian radio and Myrtle recorded the numbers from the show with the Indian Columbia records, so the audience could enjoy her performance at home. In January 1942, Japanese troops occupied Kuala Lumpur. Lall Singh was seized and placed in a work camp with his brother, BS Gill (who eventually died) until the country was liberated in August 1945. Starting in Calcutta, the Quit India movement swept across the country, with protesters demanding the creation of an independent India. Myrtle obtained an American passport during the summer with plans of leaving the country before things got too bad. Soon the bliss of India was gone when Japanese planes were bombing Calcutta in early 1943. The Grand Hotel became flooded with soldiers, and her shows were used to boost troop morale. =Mexico and return to the United States (1944‚Äì49)= Decided it might be time to move on, Paquita and Zarate now newly engaged, boarded the USS Hermitage, accompanied with Polish refugees, for California, arriving in San Pedro during the summer of 1943. California was stirring with chaos as the Zoot Suit Riots broke out across the West Coast. Arriving in Los Angeles, the couple traveled south to Mexico to Zarate's hometown, El Oro de Hidalgo to spend times with his numerous relatives. After a while in Mexico, they returned to Los Angeles, because it offered more opportunities in the entertainment field. Paquita also began informing everyone that she was an Indian princess of the Brahmin caste sent by her parents to study in Europe, a story probably developed to prevent racial issues she would have faced as an African-American artist. On January 6, 1944, the couple married quietly in Seattle. 'Zarate & Paquita' took their show across the Western & Southwestern United States, Hawaii, Alaska and Mexico. They played with big names across the US, including Liberace. They were regular entertainers around Reno, Salt Lake City, San Jose and Eugene, Oregon. They soon purchased a home in Evanston, Wyoming, along Interstate-80 near Salt Lake City, with access to Utah, Nevada and California. During the summer of 1947, they performed at the Bastille Day celebrations in Reno for the French Consul. Their concerts usually began with Zarate playing classical violin and viola numbers in the first half and in the second half when Paquita would join Zarate on drums, dancing in a frenzy dressed in elegant gowns and singing songs from around the world in five different languages. With such a hectic touring schedule, it seems they bothered to take too many breaks. Despite Zarate often returning home to Mexico to visit relatives, it doesn't seem as if Paquita returned to Alabama to see any family; or even visit Detroit to attend her father's funeral in 1946. =Later career and death (1952‚Äì68)= In 1952, Zarate filed for American neutrality so could establish himself more in the United States. Zarate also took up contracts from numerous recording companies, particularly Northwestern. Zarate and Paquita's records sold well across the Western United States. Later on, Zarate opened his own music recording company, ZARPAC, based in their Los Angeles home, which also contained a recording studio. They recorded more than before, nearly a dozen recordings a year and appeared on American radio and television. They became known in performing foreign songs and also experimented in different genres, such as Calypso, which had become popular during the early-1950s. Sometime around 1953, while performing in Chicago, a strong wind damaged their home in Evanston, Wyoming. Cancelling their appearance, they traveled to California and bought a house in Sun Valley, confining their travels to the West Coast. In 1958, they released a religious album, each song dedicated to different religions across the world such as Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam. In 1959, they performed in a year- long spectacle at the Lamplighter Lounge in Corvallis, Oregon. By 1957, they began frequently touring the central Oregon coast under contract to one of the largest nightclubs in Portland. The owner of a new motel and lounge complex in Depoe Bay, Oregon, wanted them to entertain there on a part-time basis. On their first visit, Zarate saw a 'For-Sale' sign on two concrete oxen standing outside a small green house called \\"Trails End\\" on six acres of brushland between Lincoln City and Depoe Bay. He suggested they buy it, but Paquita suggested otherwise, \\"Yes, here in the middle of nowhere.\\" The sign was still there upon their second visit and Zarate and Paquita bought the property in 1959. They built a new house and had the oxen separated and placed on either end of the driveway that loops off Highway 101. They built a studio, so Zarate could teach violin, guitar, piano, flute and organ - instruments he had mastered over the years. Paquita gave lessons in dance and numerous languages. There was also an adjoining restaurant, The Gingerbread House, providing traditional Mexican and Indian cuisine; children were permitted without charge to encourage more students and guests. A number of students enrolled at the Happy Village Cultural Center. But the institution was not profitable, especially as Paquita became too involved with the children and it hurt her health, which was already debilitated by diabetes according to Zarate. To continue running things, they made numerous appearances over the years at the popular Amato's Supper Club and at the King Surf Beach Resort's Pagan Hut restaurant. Zarate performed at weddings across Oregon and they both entertained at gatherings hosted by the elite of the west coast. This helped bring money to continue running things back at their small estate. During the spring of 1962, in Wecoma Beach (now Lincoln City) they appeared in an International Music Recital where they presented their varied repertoires of dances and songs in numerous languages and instruments. Their stage appearances became very minimal for many years afterwards, except for the annual appearances in Mexico during the spring and winter. After 1965, they also began appearing annually at the Salishan Bar & Grill. Paquita watched as cars went faster and faster by their home, and it troubled her to think that people were in such a hurry. She wanted to give them a place where they could pull over for a few minutes and \\"give their souls a chance to catch up with them.\\" Zarate wanted to wait until her health improved, so they could build it together. Myrtle \\"Paquita\\" Zarate died on November 10, 1968, of diabetic complications. Zarate immediately built a small white chapel on the property among the pines he planted in her honor, and hardly left except to visit relatives in Mexico during the winter. The Fine Arts School continued running, but doesn't seem to have drawn many students as they had before her death. Samuel Zarate continued performing across the Oregon and Mexico until his death in 1997.

She prefers to call herself an earth scientist. She has primarily worked on earth quakes and their source mechanisms. She has worked extensively on earth quake patterns in India and is considered to be one of the pioneers in this field.  Research fields  Rajendran has been working in the following areas: * Seismotectonics, Crustal Processes * Role of Water in Faulting Process * Paleoseismology, earthquake recurrence and active tectonics * Tsunami recurrence and hazard evaluation  Education and career  Rajendran has completed her Master of Technology in the field of Applied Geophysics from the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee in 1979. She graduated from University of South Carolina, USA with a Doctor of Philosophy in Seismology in the year 1992. Owing to the growing demand for well qualified seismologists at the time, she returned to India after completing her PhD. Additionally, as her son had become old enough then, she could travel around the world studying earthquakes with greater ease . She has worked extensively in Gujarat, Maharasthra and the Himalayas. She believes that India is a great potential earth science destination, considering that the Himalayas constitute of one of the most active plate collision boundary in the world. She has published around forty research papers in collaboration with her husband C.P. Rajendran, a reputed Indian geologist, over the years. She has led several projects as the principal investigator. Most of her projects are funded by the seismicity program of the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) or the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS). Rajendran has been a professor at the Center for Earth Sciences, IISc Bengaluru, India since 2007. She develops her own teaching philosophy and methodology as there are hardly any prescribed textbooks in Geophysics for undergraduates. They also work on earthquake recurrence, tsunami recurrence and hazard evaluations. Her work combines field observations and models developed in the lab. For field visits, she usually travels in groups to earthquake prone areas and places that have recently experienced an earthquake.  Family and personal life  Rajendran grew up in a conservative family where the children were usually married off after a bachelor's degree. The only reason the young Kusala, fresh out of her chemistry degree, was sent all the way from Trivandrum, Kerala, to Roorkee, then-Uttar Pradesh, was that her sister was working there.

Its wing was constructed in a novel way. Only one was completed. Design The Kellner-B√©chereau 23 was the first aircraft known as a Kellner-B√©chereau (the company was founded in 1931), though the only example built (F-AKGH) was originally marked as the B√©chereau 23. It was a single engine cabin aircraft with an all-metal, three part cantilever wing constructed in a novel way. In place of spars, an approximately oval section, light metal tube, shaped around a wooden form which was then removed, provided both structural strength and formed the outer skin of the forward half of the wing. A more conventional lattice structure was attached to the rear of the tube and supported ailerons. The whole wing was then fabric covered. In plan, the wing was approximately elliptical. The centre section, occupying about 20% of the span, was built into the fuselage and the outer panels tapered rapidly to pointed tips. The wings also tapered in section; the upper surface was horizontal but the lower sloped upwards, providing about 5¬∞ dihedral at the centreline. Their trailing edges were entirely filled with two-part, high aspect ratio ailerons. Its flat-sided cross-section fuselage was built around four spruce longerons, transversely braced with steel tubes. They supported a light, fabric covered body formed with plywood frames and stringers. The Salmson 7AC, a seven-cylinder radial engine, was in a pointed nose with its cylinders exposed for cooling. Its fuel tanks were in the wing centre-section. The tourer's cabin seated two in tandem under a long, multi-part, fully glazed canopy which ran from the leading edge to mid-chord, then blended without change in height into the upper fuselage. The cabin had two small baggage holds in the centre wing section, each providing of space. The empennage of the Kellner-B√©chereau 23 was conventional, with a triangular tailplane mounted on the upper fuselage and carrying narrow, rounded elevators was wire braced to the blunted triangular fin which carried a curved and narrow unbalanced rudder. The tourer had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage with independent mainwheels on hinged V-struts from the fuselage underside and near-vertical sprung legs, with B√©chereau shock absorbers, from the wings. The mainwheels, with a track of , were equipped with independent brakes. At the rear the sprung tailwheel was free to castor. Operational history The date of the Kellner-B√©chereau 23's first flight is not known but by early September 1932 it was sufficiently developed to begin its official tests with the S.T. A√© at Villacoublay, flown by Seitz. These were resumed in December. In September 1933 it was one of the eleven aircraft in the third annual, eight day Tour de France des avions prototypes.

It is said that chicken was provided to army and battalions. Generally Bramin people of Nepal http://www.fao.org/docrep/004/T0706E/T0706E05.htm Sustainable livestock production did not use to take chicken along with pork. It was regarded as taboo in Brahmin community. So poultry was only limited to Limbus and Rais and other cast people in the past. Present condition Poultry farming in Nepal As Nepal is an agricultural country, poultry farming is one of the important occupation of the peoples.http://www.irinnews.org/report/98463/analysis-why- livestock-matters-nepal Why livestockis important in Nepal Mainly local breeds are reared in Nepal but improved breeds like broiler and layers are also occupying a large area these days. Easy for rearing, less manpower, less investment etc. are some possible causes of high development of poultry farming. Demand for the chicken is increasing because of its low price and health importances. So people have started poultry farming instead of other animals rearing. Latest survey in Nepal shows that chicken is eaten most by the people of Nepal. So there is high possibility of poultry development in Nepal. Mostly fowls are reared beside turkeys and ducks are also reared. Still chicken is not consumed by some Brahmin people in Nepal but it is getting forward as one of the important branch of agriculture.

With an apparent magnitude of 7.075, the star can be found with binoculars or a small telescope in the constellation Hercules. HD 164595 has one known planet, , which orbits HD 164595 every 40 days. It was detected with the radial velocity technique with the SOPHIE echelle spectrograph. The planet has a minimal mass equivalent of 16 Earths. The star has the same stellar classification as the Sun: G2V. It has a similar temperature, at compared with for the Sun. It has a lower logarithm of metallicity ratio, at ‚àí0.06 compared with 0.00, and a slightly younger age, at 4.5 versus 4.6 billion years. In 2016, HD 164595 briefly attracted media attention after it was reported that a possible SETI signal had been detected from the direction of the star in the previous year. The signal was only heard once and never confirmed by other telescopes, and is thought to have been due to terrestrial interference.  Signal observation and SETI  Plot of radio signal intensity On 15 May 2015, a brief, single radio signal at 11 GHz (2.7 cm wavelength) was observed in the direction of HD 164595 by a team led by N. N. Bursov involving Claudio Maccone at the RATAN-600 radio observatory. The signal may have been caused by terrestrial radio-frequency interference or gravitational lensing from a more distant source. It was observed only once (for two seconds), by a single team, at a single telescope, giving it a Rio Scale score of 1 (insignificant) or 2 (low). Discussions in the media from 29 August 2016 onwards featured speculation that the signal could be caused by an isotropic beacon from a Type II civilization. The senior astronomer of the SETI Institute, Seth Shostak, stated that confirmation by another telescope is required. Astronomer Nicholas Suntzeff of Texas A&M; University stated that the signal is in a military frequency band, and that it could have been a satellite downlink, implying that some such systems may be kept secret and therefore would be unknown to SETI scientists. SETI and METI studies followed with the Allen Telescope Array and the Boquete Optical SETI Observatory. Also, scientists at Berkeley SETI Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley observed HD 164595 using the Green Bank Telescope as part of the Breakthrough Listen program. No signal was detected at the position and frequency of the transient reported by the RATAN group. The Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences has since released an official statement that the signal is of a \\"most probable terrestrial origin\\".

At the age of fifteen his poem Watching God's World (Dyvliachys na Myr Bozhyi) was published in the Volyn newspaper (1906). Soon after that his first short story appeared in Dzvinok magazine. In 1914 Klym Polishchuk's first book, Faraway Stars (Daleki Zori), was published. In 1919, in Kyiv, Klym Polishchuk joined other Ukrainian authors such as Pavlo Tychyna, Yakiv Savchenko, Les Kurbas, Pavlo Phylypovych, Dmytro Zahul, Oleksa Slisarenko, Mykhailo Ivchenko and Mykhailo Zhuk in establishing Muzahet, a literature and art group that focused on the characteristics of Ukrainian national literature. In 1920 Muzahet was banned and most of its members were later sentenced and executed.Muzahet, Internet Encyclopaedia of Ukraine Thematically, Klym Polishchuk's prose works are divided into two major groups. The first group consists of works incorporating Ukrainian folklore and legends, including Handful of Earth: Halychyna Legends and Treasure of the Ages: Ukrainian Legends.

The piece was composed for the music festival Related Rocks which celebrates the works of Lindberg and related composers. Its world premiere was given at The Anvil, Basingstoke on February 6, 2002 by the Philharmonia Orchestra under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen, to whom the work is dedicated. Composition Parada is composed in a single slow movement and has a duration of approximately 13 minutes. =Instrumentation= The work is scored for a large orchestra consisting of two flutes (2nd doubling piccolo), two oboes, English horn, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons (2nd doubling contrabassoon), four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, two percussionists, harp, piano (doubling celesta), and strings. Reception Parada has been praised by music critics. Reviewing the world premiere, Fiona Maddocks of The Observer opined, \\"Parada, part of the Related Rocks festival, is an expansive, mainly slow (unusual for Lindberg) single movement. It opens with lush, dream-like massed strings, muted and using vibrato. Within this slow trajectory, moments of rapid action and clarity - brass explosions and woodwind ripples - unsettle the hazy stillness, dying away with simple cello pizzicatos. Lindberg achieves luminous orchestral effects, holding the sounds poised as if centrifugally. The Philharmonia, now well groomed in his style, made masterly work of its subtleties.\\" Reviewing the United States premiere by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Mark Swed of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Magnus Lindberg's Parada begins with a slow parade of chords. They are somber but colorful. They move with solemn grace, like ghostly visions floating through a fog. And when you have resonant chords like these--complex and new, yet somehow familiar-sounding, cloaked in beautiful sonorities, awash in mystery--you have a pretty good sense that something special is about to follow in their wake.\\" He added, \\"It is a weighty slow movement, with lots of fast things happening on the surface and distant hints of Sibelius.\\" Anne Midgette of The Washington Post called it \\"an attractive braid of music created by winding two disparate ideas - a fast scherzo and the slow shimmer of strings - into a single whole, now full, now slender, set off with gleaming beads of percussion, tapering at the end to something gentle and warm.\\" She added, \\"It took a big orchestra, including a full complement of percussion, but felt light.\\" However, reviewing a recording of the piece alongside other Lindberg works, the magazine Gramophone was somewhat critical of the piece, remarking, \\"Parada‚Äö the slowestmoving of these scores‚Äö is also the most frankly Sibelian‚Äö full of gestures and textures redolent of the inescapable Finnish master. While its ravishing invention is easy to enjoy‚Äö I wasn't sure how it was meant to hold together‚Äö so this may or may not be the place to start for the uninitiated.\\" Recording A commercial recording of Parada, performed by the Philharmonia Orchestra under Salonen, was released through Sony Classical Records in 2002.

He moves in with the two girls Chrissy and Jo after they find him in their bath (with his clothes on!) after the girls held a party the previous night. Robin was raised on a farm in the middle of the countryside and is frequently asked by his mother and father to rejoin them in the family business of making pipes. He is always bringing his girlfriends over and is usually unsuccessful. He is a fan of Southampton F.C. and Fulham F.C. and attends their matches. Robin is best friends with Larry. =Chrissy Plummer= Played by Paula Wilcox Chrissy lives in the flat, whom Mildred and George Roper are caretakers of, with Jo, then Robin moves in. She is often taken out by men in all different shapes, sizes and natures. Chrissy is fond of tending her flowers on the balcony, and always prefers her or Robin's cooking as Jo's is always dreadful. She has a sister named Susan who is married to Ted, whom her father dislikes. Chrissy's mother visits Chrissy at the flat and is pressures her to get married. Chrissy detests Larry living upstairs. =Jo= Played by Sally Thomsett Jo, the dippy blonde dolly bird who is rubbish at cooking, is very keen on having parties in the flat with loud music, the opposite of the Ropers! She is always forgetting things and is always doing things wrong. Jo is often asked out by the men at the local pub and does not get on with Larry, like Chrissy, her best friend. =Mildred Roper= Played by Yootha Joyce Mildred is the long suffering wife of George who is always getting on her nerves. Whether she buys a new hat or armchair, George is not bothered. It is hinted that she used to have many flings with men when she used to work at an airbase during the war. Mildred has a sister called Ethel, who is a snob and is disliked by George and many others. She also has a sexual interest in Robin. Mildred dislikes Jerry, George's best friend and odd-job man who is usually conning people. =George Roland Roper= Played by Brian Murphy The dim, lazy husband of Mildred Roper is either at the pub, arguing with Mildred or watching his television set, which is often breaks down. George sometimes meets the flatmates in the local pub and is known to be fond of having a Scotch. George is easily led. It was implied in the spin-off series George and Mildred that he was one of seven children. =Larry Simmonds= Played by Doug Fisher Larry is the best friend of Robin and the neighbour of Robin, Chrissy and Jo as he lives upstairs in the newly refurbished attic. He frequently visits Robin's flat to borrow things and never gives them back. Larry used to live in another flat but was evicted as he was not paying his rent. He often brings girls of all natures home, but, as he tells Robin, he never gives his real name and usually gives false ones, one once being Robin Tripp! =Norman Tripp= Played by Norman Eshley Norman Tripp is Robin's brother who is only seen at the end of the series, not being mentioned before then. He comes to stay with Robin for a few days and starts a relationship with Chrissy. They then arrange to get married and the day before Norman and Chrissy's wedding and Mildred is upset that she has not received an invitation. However, when she delivers their wedding present she discovers that they have been invited and that George has hidden it from her because he wants to go to a darts match. Norman eventually marries Chrissy, and they presumably start a new life together. =Jerry= Played by Roy Kinnear The incompetent odd job man who is often persuaded by George to get him to do various jobs around the flat that do not even need doing. Apart from George, he is disliked by all, especially Mildred. He once tried to get Robin, Chrissy and Jo evicted so he could subdivide the flat into smaller units. He also diagnosed one of the doors in the flat as having woodworm despite there being a perfect circle of unmarked wood and a dartboard lying on the floor - the holes were created by missed darts! =Mrs Plummer= Played by Daphne Oxenford Chrissy's mother often bothers Chrissy by pressuring her to marry, and annoys Robin. On the day of Chrissy's sister Susan's baby's christening, she goes on that much about Chrissy and Robin getting married that they return home. =Liz Martin= Played by Jenny Hanley Liz Martin is Robin's girlfriend who appears in two episodes. Her first appearance sees her trying to sneak into the flat to spend some time with Robin. It is shown that she has many flings with men and when she is invited to Robin, Chrissy and Jo's party, she stays the whole time with Chrissy's boyfriend, Mark (played by Ian Lavender). Neither are seen again in the series. =Jim the Barman= Played by Michael Segal Seen in the first two series, Jim is the friendly barman at the local pub, The Mucky Duck. He often helps Robin out by giving him alcohol 'on the slate' for parties. =The Barman= Played by John Carlin The camp Scottish barman at the pub, sometimes referred to as Percy, is obviously homosexual and frequently misunderstands what people say, thinking that it is something sexual. He is very friendly to all, especially Robin, Larry and Mr Roper. =Dr. McCleod= Played by Duncan Lamont The local doctor, who appears in two episodes, McCleod treats Robin for flu before his football match and appears again in the episode \\"Three of a Kind\\".

There are a variety of different types of marine thrusters and each of them plays a huge role in the maritime industry. Marine thrusters come in many different shapes and sizes for example screw propellers, Voith-Schneider propellers, waterjets, ducted propellers, tunnel bow thrusters, and stern thrusters, azimuth thrusters, rim- driven thrusters, ROV and submersible drive units but the thing that ties them all to the same title is their basic function and components. A marine thruster consists of a propeller or an impeller encased in some kind of tunnel that directs the flow of water across the propeller to obtain movement in the desired direction. The two subcategories of marine thrusters are propulsion and maneuvering, the maneuvering thruster typically coming in the form of bow or stern thrusters and propulsion thrusters ranging from Azimuth thrusters to Rim Drive thrusters that have a rotor with propellers facing inwards (Azimuth Thrusters ‚Äì Kongsberg). These thrusters have been developed alongside propellers and have some advantages over propellers due to their construction with a tunnel that reduces losses thrown out the sides as with a propeller and is contained in only the direction intended for use.  Positioning Thrusters  Repairs being performed on the bow thruster of the Bro Elizabeth Positioning thrusters come in 2 main form factors, those being bow thrusters situated on the forward end of the boat and stern thrusters set in the aft of the boat. Their purpose, as the name suggests is to maneuver or position the boat to a greater degree than the propulsion device can ultimately accomplish. Their positioning at various places along the length of the boat allows for directed jets of water in both the head or stern of the boat so that the boat may be steered away from obstacles and obstructions in its path, especially when coming to or away from a dock. Unlike propulsion thrusters, these positioning thrusters are usually significantly smaller because they only have to do small adjustments rather than moving the whole vessel (Kasuhik, 2019). Both bow and stern thrusters utilize through-hull tunnels meaning they go through the entirety of the boat's exterior without compromising its buoyancy or integrity. Within these through-hull tunnels, several propellers appropriately sized for the vessel they‚Äôre installed on, are housed. Depending on the size of the motors driving these propellers, they could draw an insignificant amount of power or a large amount of power that requires much caution to operate. Another smaller subset of positioning thrusters is those used for maneuvering unmanned aquatic vehicles like Guanay II AUV tested by scientists from Spain (Masmitja, 2018).  Propulsion Thrusters  Rim-Driven Thruster on a Swing-Out Azimuthing unit Propulsion thrusters are those thrusters that are bigger and more powerful than their maneuvering brothers and whose purpose is to provide adequate locomotion for large vessels as an alternative to traditional propellers. There are a variety of different types of these propulsion thrusters but the most ubiquitous form is the Azimuth thruster, a thruster that can rotate 360 degrees for thrust in any direction the operator desires (Lindborg, 1997). Like all other thrusters, the Azimuth thruster is contained in a tube-like shell that directs the flow of water through the propeller for thrust in one direction based on the position set by the controller. Because of their versatility and ease of positioning, these thrusters can be used as both propulsion and positioning thrusters even from the stern of the ship (Azimuth Thrusters - Kongsberg). They use low power bursts to position in whichever direction suits the vessel‚Äôs needs and use greater power directed astern when propelling the entire ship. There are offshoots of Azimuth thrusters such as CRP thrusters which are two contra- rotating Azimuth thrusters or Swing-Up Azimuth thrusters that can be retracted when not in use to reduce drag on the vessel (Wartsila Encyclopedia). Other propulsion thrusters like outboard thrusters which can be easily put in and out of service, rim drive thrusters that operate from an external ring with the blade facing the center of the thruster or tilted thrusters pointed away from the hull to minimize interaction with the ship and increase thruster efficiency. There are different schools of thought as to why thrusters would be used to propel marine vessels as opposed to traditional propellers, but it boils down to versatility and efficiency. propellers are designed to work in- line with a propulsion plant and produce one-directional thrust while thrusters are more customizable and have a more versatile application. They have this versatility because they are not as robust as propellers and typically have applications on smaller vessels that don‚Äôt require as much power, so it depends on what purpose the propulsion device is needed for.

Flavored medicine Kramm's youngest daughter began suffering epileptic seizures weeks after her birth in February 1992. Once she was able to be released from the hospital, she balked at the multiple daily doses of phenobarbital needed to prevent grand mal seizures, by either refusing to take the ill-tasting medicine or holding it in her mouth until it leaked out. Her seizures continued, resulting in more hospital trips. Within a few months, Kramm and his wife Shelley decided something must be done. In May 1992, Kramm's father, Harold, suggested sweetening the medicine with flavorings used by candy manufacturers. The men spent their evenings, after store hours, tasting different samples. Kramm then took home the flavored medicine that he hoped his daughter would approve. She ultimately picked one and resumed her proper dosage.

Biography  Fortun√©e Bernier received a very good education and was one of the most outstanding students of Hilaire-Alexandre Briquet, who later became her husband, and who inserted her early writings in the Almanach des Muses. In 1800, an Ode sur les vertus civiles opened her the doors of the Society of Literature and of the salons of Paris. Fanny de Beauharnais, the First consul aunt, gave the signal for applause by sending these verses, with her poem l‚ÄôIle de la F√©licit√©: Later were published Odes sur la mort de Dolomieu, an ode to Denis Lebrun, la Vertu est la base des r√©publiques, and her M√©moire sur Klopstock, sa vie et ses ouvrages, which earned her entrance in the \\"Ath√©n√©e des arts\\" of Paris. However, Fortun√©e Briquet's most important work is undoubtedly her famous Dictionnaire historique, litt√©raire et bibliographique des Fran√ßaises et des √©trang√®res naturalis√©es en France (Paris, Gill√©, 1804, in-8¬∞). She still produced a few pieces in 1807, but soon stopped writing. Domestic troubles poisoned her last days, her health faltered and she died. The historian was her son.

It is also used in the treatment of Klinefelter's syndrome, aplastic anemia, Cushing's syndrome (as an anabolic to preserve lean body mass), postmenopausal osteoporosis in women, advanced breast cancer in women, breast pain in women, and cachexia. Testosterone isobutyrate has been used in masculinizing hormone therapy for transgender men as well. =Available forms= Testosterone isobutyrate is provided in the form of a 25 mg/mL microcrystalline aqueous suspension packaged in 2 mL ampoules (5 ampoules per box). This equates to a dose of 50 mg per ampoule. Testosterone isobutyrate (25 mg) is also available in combination with estradiol benzoate (2.5 mg) under the brand name Folivirin (1 mL ampoules).http://www.sukl.cz/download/pil/PI15789.pdf Side effects Side effects of testosterone isobutyrate include virilization among others. Pharmacology Testosterone isobutyrate is a prodrug of testosterone, and hence is an agonist of the androgen receptor, the biological target of endogenous androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. It produces both androgenic and anabolic effects, as well as weak estrogenic effects due to metabolism of testosterone into estradiol. In contrast to most other testosterone esters, which are used as amorphous oil solutions, testosterone isobutyrate is provided in the form of a microcrystalline aqueous suspension. It has very low water solubility and forms a long-lasting microcrystalline depot within muscle upon intramuscular injection. This respository slowly dissolves over time. As a result, testosterone isobutyrate has a prolonged duration of action of approximately 2 weeks. It is administered at intervals of once every 1 to 2 weeks in men. Microcrystalline testosterone isobutyrate in aqueous suspension requires a larger needle (21 gauge) than oil solutions due to the presence of solid crystals in the suspension. It can produce local irritation, pain, and redness upon injection. Chemistry Testosterone isobutyrate, or testosterone 17Œ≤-(2-methylpropanoate), is a synthetic androstane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is an androgen ester; specifically, it is the C17Œ≤ 2-methylpropanoate (isobutyrate) ester of testosterone. History Microcrystalline testosterone isobutyrate in aqueous suspension was first described in 1952. It was introduced for medical use shortly thereafter. Around the same time, testosterone enanthate in oil solution was introduced for medical use. It became the dominant long-acting injectable form of testosterone, and limited the commercial success of testosterone isobutyrate. The combination of microcrystalline estradiol benzoate and testosterone isobutyrate in aqueous suspension was introduced under the brand name Femandren M by 1953. Society and culture =Brand names= Brand names of testosterone isobutyrate include Agovirin-Depot, Perandren M, Testocryst, and Virex-Cryst. It has also been marketed in combination with estradiol benzoate under the brand names Femandren M and Folivirin. =Availability= Testosterone isobutyrate is available only in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. It was originally manufactured by the pharmaceutical company SPOFA intermittently manufactured by Biotika, and is now manufactured by BB Pharma.

Analogously to estradiol benzoate having been one of the first estrogen esters to be introduced, testosterone phenylacetate was one of the first testosterone esters to be introduced. However, since its introduction, it has largely been replaced by other esters, such as testosterone propionate. Testosterone phenylacetate was a 50 mg/mL microcrystalline aqueous suspension under the brand name Perandren. It was used at a dosage of 50 to 200 mg by intramuscular injection once every 2 to 5 weeks. The medication was used to treat hypogonadism and eunuchoidism in males and for palliation of breast cancer in females. It was developed by Ciba Pharmaceutical Company. A study found that, measured by 17-ketosteroid excretion, 300 mg testosterone propionate in oil solution had a duration of 5 days, 300 mg testosterone propionate in aqueous suspension had a duration of 13 days, 353 mg testosterone cypionate in oil solution had a duration of 24 days, and 354 mg testosterone phenylacetate in aqueous suspension had a duration of 66 days. In 1955, testosterone phenylacetate in aqueous suspension was said to have the longest duration of any clinically used androgen marketed up to that point. Testosterone phenylacetate in aqueous suspension by intramuscular injection, similarly to other aqueous suspension formulations, causes local injection site reactions, including local pain, swelling, and tenderness. These symptoms last for several days after the injection and then subside. These reactions do not typically occur with oil solutions. The injection site reactions were viewed as less important in the case of testosterone phenylacetate due to its prolonged duration and less frequent administration.

Dramaturgy  Turner's dramaturgical research focuses on the relationship between performance and place, an area she has explored and documented in her book Dramaturgy and Architecture: Theatre, Utopia and the Built Environment.  Wrights & Sites  Turner is a founding member of Wrights & Sites, a group of artist-researchers who develop site-specific artistic works. They are best known for their walking misguides, and their use of the Letterist/Situationist practice of d√©rive.  Walking Women  In 2009 Turner collaborated with Deirdre Heddon on a series of interviews with women walking artists. In their two essays, 'Walking Women: Shifting the Tales and Scales of Mobility' and 'Walking Women: interviews with artists on the move', Heddon and Turner argue that a fraternal lineage dominates walking, with the practices of female walkers erased or marginalised. Their work introduces the voices of contemporary female artists that walk into the historical record. Heddon and Turner's work has sparked a series of practice-based interventions that focus on women who walk. These include 'Er Outdoors' a series of radio programs curated by Jo Norcup that make 'audible the voices of women past and present'; and WALKING WOMEN, a series of exhibitions, talks and events curated by Amy Sharrocks and Clare Qualmann that actively 're-write the canon' and 'imagine a future in which gender bias and skewed vision is destroyed'.

For these murders, he and his wife Rosemary West (against whom Leach testified at trial) became notorious. The murders‚Äìfirst committed by Fred before he met Rosemary and then by the two of them as co-conspirators‚Äìincluded the kidnapping, rape, torture, and murder of various young women, including their own children and stepchildren. Fred committed suicide in his cell while on remand on New Year's Day 1995. Rosemary was convicted and became one of three women in Britain to be handed a whole life tariff (the others being Myra Hindley and, in 2014, Joanne Dennehy). Life and work with police An appropriate adult is a parent, guardian, or social worker who, when a child under 18 or vulnerable adult is called in for questioning by police, helps them understand the legal process. Leach was a thirty-eight-year-old mother of five, divorced from her first husband and training to be a social worker, when in 1994 she was asked to serve in this capacity for Fred West, due to his illiteracy and the severity of the charges levelled against him. An unpaid volunteer, Leach knew nothing about West beyond his age and illiteracy, and didn't know what he was accused of before sitting in on the interrogation. When they first met he denied killing his daughter, Heather, to detectives but later confessed to Leach, who, due to a confidentiality agreement, couldn't share the information with anyone, including police. Before West's suicide Leach spent more than 400 hours in his company, and hearing the details of his crimes created a mental strain. Eventually, she refused to stay in the role of his appropriate adult unless he confessed to police, which he did. West had developed an attachment to Leach, describing her as his \\"only friend\\" and refusing to speak to detectives unless she was present. Leach recalled that speculation about their supposed bond was rife; due to a physical resemblance to Anna McFall, a lover of West's whom he probably murdered (before he met Rosemary), untrue rumours spread that she was related to him, or possibly one of his girlfriends. Controversy and trial The nature of Leach's connection with Fred West has been controversial. She stayed in contact with him, even after questioning ended and there was nothing for her to do in her capacity as appropriate adult. Her son, Paul, claimed that she \\"fell under West's spell\\" and that she became greatly distressed when she learned that he had killed himself. Janet, however, denied this, saying that her grief was due to West dying before giving her the information needed to find still missing bodies. She said that she kept talking to Fred to find out what had happened to his victims: \\"I was desperate. I couldn‚Äôt sleep at night. I kept having nightmares about all those poor girls in the cellar. But I felt I had to keep talking to Fred. Otherwise, how would their families ever know what had happened to them?\\" The stress she was under contributed to a dramatic moment in the trial of the Wests. Unexpectedly called to testify against Rosemary, Leach had a stroke in the witness box after falsely claiming that she had not signed a deal with the press to sell her story. In fact, she had sold her story to the Daily Mirror and admitted this when she returned to the witness box several days later, following treatment at a hospital. Aftermath In 1997, Leach lodged a complaint with the Court of Appeal seeking the right to sue police for compensation on the grounds that she suffered posttraumatic stress disorder as a result of her work as an appropriate adult for Fred West. Unlike the officers and defence solicitor involved in the case, she had not been offered counselling, as she was an unpaid volunteer. In November 1997 her original claim for compensation was thrown out by a judge, who ruled that the police did not owe her a duty of care. Her defence team put forward that a duty of care was appropriate since she had been asked to sit with one of the most notorious criminals of the 20th century. Dramatisation The 2011 TV drama Appropriate Adult, starring Emily Watson as Leach, focused on the part played by Leach in the police interviews with Fred West, in the visits to the crime scenes, and in Leach's prison visits and correspondence with West. Commenting on the film, retired police officer Bennet, who was in charge of the investigation, said that although the portrayals of Fred and Rose West were \\"hauntingly accurate\\", providing \\"an even deeper insight\\" into their psyche, Leach's role in the case was exaggerated. Paul Leach, Janet's eldest son, was upset at the way his mother was portrayed in the TV film. In defence of Leach, Watson said: \\"Everyone involved in the case entered a moral universe for which they were completely unequipped\\". Writer Neil McKay commented: \\"I do feel that Janet‚Äôs story in many ways reflects how any of us would have reacted\\".

Early life Sheikh Sharfuddin Ahmed was born on July 1264 A.D. (Sha'aban 661 A.H.) at Maner, a village near Patna in Bihar. His father was Makhdoom Kamaluddin Yahya Maneri bin Israel bin Taj Faqeeh from Al-Khaleel (Palestine), a Sufi saint of Maner. His maternal grandfather Shahabuddin JagjotBalkhi, whose tomb is located at Kachchi Dargah in Patna district, was also a revered Sufi. At age 12, he left Maner to gain traditional knowledge of Arabic, Persian, logic, philosophy and religion. He was tutored by Ashraf-Uddin Abu Towama Bukhari, a famous scholar from Sonargaon near Narainganj (now in Dhaka, Bangladesh) with whom he spent 24 years. At first, he refused to marry but, upon falling ill, he married Bibi Badaam. He left home after the birth of his son Zakiuddin in 1289 A.D. His son lived and died in Bengal.  Career  After completing his education he left for Delhi where he met Nizamuddin and other Sufis. His elder brother Makhdoom Jaleeluddin Maneri (buried at Badi Dargah in Maner Sharif) accompanied him there, and introduced him to his pir (spiritual master) Sheikh Najeebuddin Firdausi. In Delhi, he became a disciple of Sheikh Najeebuddin Firdausi of Mehrauli and was given the title of Firdausi. To shun material comforts, Sheikh Sharfuddin Ahmed bin Yahya Maneri went into the forest of Bihiya (about 15 miles west of Maner). He later went to Rajgir (about 75 miles east of Maner) where he performed ascetic exercises in the hills. A hot spring close to a place where he often prayed in Rajgir is named Makhdoom Kund in his memory. After 30 years in the forests, Sheikh Sharfuddin Ahmed bin Yahya Maneri settled at Bihar Sharif.Later Sultan Muhammad Tughlaq built a Khanqah for him where he taught and trained disciples in Sufism (Tasawwuf). He devoted his life to teaching and writing. Bibliography The collection of his letters (Maktoobat) and sermons (Malfoozat) received wide acclaim.

He is influenced by the ideas of Chinnarasu (R. Parthiban), a local leader who had also sponsored his education. Chinnarasu and Kittu try to fight against the rampant caste discrimination meted out to them by the upper caste people, but are unable to do much about it as the police and courts are biased towards the upper castes. One day, Kittu sees his classmate Gomathi (Sri Divya), who is from the upper caste, discriminate against a Dalit girl. He admonishes her publicly for her act of caste discrimination, which makes her repent her behaviour. Gomathi eventually falls in love with Kittu, but Kittu maintains a distance as they are from different castes, though he too is in love with her. When the news spreads through the village that Gomathi is in love with Kittu, upper caste men kill Gomathi's father and frame Kittu, who is imprisoned, but is soon released on bail as there is no evidence that he had killed Gomathi's father. Kittu then assaults the village inspector Selvaraj (Harish Uthaman), who holds a grudge against the Dalits and was responsible for framing him for the death of Gomathi's father. In retribution, Selvaraj arrests Kittu and thrashes him mercilessly in the police station. Kittu does not return home the next morning, despite Selvaraj's pleas that he had released him, prompting the villagers to think that Selvaraj had killed Kittu while in custody as his hatred towards the Dalits is well known in the village. The Dalits led by Chinnarasu protest outside the police station, leading to Selvaraj's suspension. However, it is then revealed that Kittu had not gone \\"missing\\" but is living in a tribal village near Kodaikanal as part of a plan hatched by Kittu and Chinnarasu to expose the upper caste men involved in the death of Gomathi's father, with Kittu deciding to return to the village after he is cleared of all involvement in the murder. Gomathi, who is aware that Kittu had not killed her father, finds out Kittu's location and runs away from her home to be with him. At this juncture, the upper caste men and the police find out that Kittu is alive and in hiding and leave for Kodaikanal to capture Kittu and bring him back to the village with the intention to imprison Kittu, humiliate Chinnarasu and reclaim their domination over the Dalits. Kittu finds out about their plan and asks Gomathi to return to the village, promising to marry her once he is cleared of all charges. Sadly, Kittu and Gomathi never reunite as Kittu had decided to commit suicide by jumping off a cliff in order to save the reputation to Chinnarasu and expose the upper caste discrimination against the Dalits. He is found dead by the police, which exposes the upper caste hatred towards the Dalits. The movie ends with the funeral procession of Kittu going through the main street of the village, which had traditionally been out of bounds for the Dalits to carry their dead, thus implying the end of caste discrimination in the village.

It depicts a myth about a woman by the name of Lucretia who lived during the ancient Roman eras. She committed suicide to defend her honor from being raped by an Etruscan king's son. She is known as a heroine to the Romans for her self sacrifice. The Romans celebrated the feminine ideals of virtue and chastity. History It was quite popular during the Baroque period for artists to paint Lucretia. Rembrandt was one of the many Dutch artists who carried the story throughout Northern Europe. It has been suggested by Svetlana Alpers that there is a significant link to the painting and his mistress Hendrickje Stoffels. In 1663, when he portrayed her as Bathsheba. Hendrickje had been chastised for \\"living like a whore\\", by the Dutch Reformed Church when she give birth to their illegitimate daughter, Cornelia van Rijn. She shared the guilt of the reified and sexually compromised woman which limited their position within patriarchy. Rembrandt never married Hendrickje because of the contents of Saskia van Uylenburgh's (Rembrandt's first wife) will, which threatened his income. He was not allowed to remarry if he wanted to inherit her fortune or see their son, Titus. Titus was the sole survivor out of three children, two of whom died shortly after birth. After the death of his wife in 1642, he hired a wet-nurse, Geertje Dircx to care for Titus. Rembrandt and Dircx soon became lovers and their relationship lasted several years. When they split, a court case for \\"breach of promise\\" arose. She had expected to marry him, after he had given her a ring belonging to his deceased wife. Rembrandt promised to pay a settlement to Dircx, on the condition that she would not change her will, which named Titus as her heir. After years of blackmailing Rembrandt, in 1650, Geertje was sent to a woman's house of correction. During the trial, Rembrandt hired Hendrickje as a housekeeper, and she became his new mistress. Even though Hendrickje and Rembrandt never married, she became his longtime partner and remained together up till Hendrickje's death. Aplers noted the patriarchal motives underlying the 1666 painting may be Rembrandt's guilt for not marrying Hendrickje, and the displacement of his domestic life. He knew of Hendrickje's experience and pain, and used her as \\"Lucretia\\" to explore the full humanity of a woman ‚Äì a tragic object of desire. Description Bathsheba at Her Bath, 1654 In this depiction of Lucretia, she is wearing an ornate gold dress and pearl earrings, indicating her status as a woman of wealth. Her dress is somewhat disarrayed, exposing her under garment. The fabric of her undergarment is stained with blood, signifying her own acceptance of impending death. In her right hand, she grips the dagger which has caused the wound to her heart, while the left hand is gripping what appears to be a bed tassel. This depiction of Lucretia is not supposed to represent idealised beauty, rather, it accentuates the anguish she is experiencing after losing her honour. Her face embodies her despair and hopelessness, her skin is pale, and her lips are small and express her grief. Subject This painting is depicting an ancient Roman legend written by Roman historian Livy, who covered the period from early Rome through to the reign of Augustus. During the ancient Roman and Greek era, legends of women committing suicide to keep their virtue pure were popular. It was a way to promote feminine ideals to women. As the legend goes, Lucretia was a noblewoman who was married to Lucius. While her husband was out performing his duty, her husband's friend Sextus and few of his men went to visit her. They wanted to see which man had the most virtuous wife. Lucretia graciously hosted her husband's guests, and as nightfall came all the men left, except Sextus. He was determined to have Lucretia for himself. After a couple of days had passed, he went back and told her she either sleep with him, or be killed with her servant, to be framed as an affair gone wrong. The next day, she sent a letter to her father, Lucretius, and her husband. When they arrived, she explained what had happened to her. She considered death as the only suitable punishment for her losing her chastity and value as a wife, by being raped. She stabbed herself.Rembrandt's Lucretia, 1664  Similar work  Rembrandt painted another depiction of Lucretia in 1664, displayed now at the National Gallery of Art. It follows the iconographic tradition which shows Lucretia clutching the dagger before she stabbed herself. Rembrandt was known to have used family and friends as models for his paintings; the 1664 Lucretia is in the likeness of his daughter-in-law Magdalena Van Loo. There has been speculation by Sir Lawrence Gowing that the 1666 figure is not Lucretia, but in fact another Roman heroine, Arria, who stabbed herself to encourage her husband, Paetus, who was sentenced to death by suicide.. Influence Caravaggio's influence spread to the Netherlands and provided adaptation of figural postures, structural principle and dark shadows. Caravaggio's style often included illuminated figures, spot-lit, emerging from surrounding shadow ‚Äì a technique called tenebrism. Rembrandt borrowed influence from this style of artwork, evident in Lucretia; she is illuminated as the focus of the painting. The dark shadowing on her face and the dark background pull her towards the viewer. There is evidence that Rembrandt pulled inspiration from Caravaggio's compositions, especially Caravaggio's David, in the case of Rembrandt's Lucretia. The head and body's composition are similar: both have their head slightly tiled to an angle, both forms end below the waist, horizontal marks on Lucretia dress may mirror David's bone structure, and Lucretia's chain across her dress is similar to the line of David‚Äôs shirt. While David is holding the head of Goliath, the Rembrandt shows Lucretia holding her bed tassel..

It is made from unleavened or leavened dough and usually filled with ground meat and chopped onion. Originally, finely chopped pre-cooked meat was used as a filling, but later raw ground meat became more common. Alternatively, peremech can be filled with potato or quark. Peremech is usually shaped into a flattened sphere with a circular \\"window\\" in the middle. In contrast to doughnuts, the hole does not go all the way through, but is only made at the top, such that the filling is visible in the middle. The shape is thus somewhat similar to Russian vatrushka. [English edition: ] However, dough neatly kneaded around the hole gives the classical peremech its distinctive shape. Peremech is traditionally served with broth, qatiq (yogurt) or ayran. Nowadays, the meat- filled version is popular throughout Russia and other post-Soviet countries where it is usually referred to as belyash (, pl. –±–µ–ª—è—à–∏, belyashi). This word appeared in Russian in the second half of the 20th century and possibly derives from another Tatar word, b…ôle≈ü, which denotes a baked full-size pie with meat and potato filling.An individual size version of b…ôle≈ü, known as waq-b…ôle≈ü, exists and is shaped similarly to peremech, but it is baked and not fried. Modern variants of belyashi can also be made without a hole in the top. Along with pirozhki and chiburekki, belyashi are a common street food in the region. In Finland the pastry is known as \\"p√§r√§m√§tsi\\" & first appeared in 1960s in Tampere.

Biography  The daughter of the choral vicar of the collegiate church of Saint-√âtienne, Marie-Ad√©la√Øde married a schoolmaster named Barth√©l√©my Hadot on January 11, 1785. Hadot also ran a small grocery store, supplemented by his woman in one and the other function. Hadot embraced with warmth the party of the Revolution, became municipal officer and a member of the Revolutionary Committee. Although he showed some moderation in performing these jobs, the school found himself completely abandoned after the and the couple was forced to take refuge in Paris. She soon became a widow and had no other resources to live than to engage in literary works in which she gave herself without reserve, while holding a small boarding school that had little success. Barth√©lemy-Hadot was one of the most prolific writers in her genre. She found time to compose, from 1804 until her death, many melodramas for boulevard theatres and at the same time, many novels little remarkable in style and still and even less by invention, but whose intentions were good, with enough moral background. Over all, she made more than a hundred volumes, not counting those she left in manuscript, dramas and novels, most of which were not intended for education. Some of her plays that were performed remained unpublished. Others were neither presented nor printed.

Threats  During investigations on the network of the suspected right wing terrorist and Bundeswehr soldier Franco Albrecht it became known, that he may have planned to kill Kahane. According to Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND), investigators found a list of possible targets in an appointment folder of the soldier, Kahane among them. They also found notes of a planned travel route: Franco Albrecht wanted to drive with his motorcycle from his hometown Offenbach am Main to Berlin. An accomplice should have brought him a shotgun. Albrecht also had photographs of cars belonging to members of the Berlin bureau of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung and was witnessed practicing with a sniper rifle. Prosecutors interprete these hints as a plan to kill Anetta Kahane.  Publications  * Ich durfte, die anderen mussten. In: Vincent von Wroblewsky (ed): Zwischen Thora und Trabant: Juden in der DDR.

Duignan (1934), \\"The Ui Bri√∫in Br√©ifni genealogies\\", pp. 90‚Äì137, in JRSAI Vol. LXIV Bryan was the eldest son and his younger brother was Lieutenant Daniel Magauran. Chieftainship Brian was the last of the M√°g Samhradh√°in lords to hold lordship. His lands had been forfeited after the Cromwellian Settlement and he lived as a tenant farmer. However, during the Williamite War in Ireland he rose in support of King James II of England when the king landed in Ireland in March 1689. The Irish Parliament declared that James remained King and passed a bill of attainder against those who supported William of Orange. The Irish Parliament also passed an Act for Liberty of Conscience that granted religious freedom to all Roman Catholics and Protestants in Ireland. As a result, the M√°g Samhradh√°in estates in Tullyhaw were restored to Brian M√°g Samhradh√°in. Battle of the Boyne King James raised an army in Ireland, but was ultimately defeated at the Battle of the Boyne on 1 July 1690 against William of Orange. Bryan Magauran fought on James‚Äôs side during the battle. He was a captain in the infantry regiment of Colonel Oliver O'Gara. Bryan's brother, Daniel Magauran, was a lieutenant (later a captain) in the same regiment. O'Gara was a member of the Patriot Parliament of 1689 where he represented of Sligo County. His regiment took part in an expedition of 1689 led by Patrick Sarsfield to capture the Protestant-held town of Sligo. In 1690 O'Gara commanded the Jacobite garrison at Jamestown in County Leitrim, repulsing an advance by a larger force of Williamite troops under James Douglas. O'Gara served with his regiment at the Battle of Aughrim, which ended in Jacobite defeat. Following the Treaty of Limerick, O'Gara acted as a hostage until it was clear the terms had been honoured. It is likely that Bryan Magauran was at his side during all those events. He is later referred to as Colonel Magauran so he may have been promoted after the Boyne. Another M√°g Samhradh√°in was a captain in the infantry regiment of Colonel Henry FitzJames (1st Duke of Albemarle in the Jacobite peerage) under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Corbet. His first name is not given but he was probably a relation of Brian M√°g Samhradh√°in. Family and end of the M√°g Samhradh√°in lordship M√°g Samhradh√°inn‚Äôs grandson Major Edward Magauran refers to the Battle of the Boyne and its effect on the family fortunes in his autobiography wherein he states- I was born in 1746 at the residence of the M'Gauran family, called from them Balli M‚ÄôGauran. It is a market town of some note, wherein four considerable fairs are annually held. During their prosperous days, a stately castle reared its head, adjoining to the town, and was the abode of the Barons, but it was dismantled by order of Oliver Cromwell, and now lies in ruins. My great grandfather having thus involved himself in O'Neil's rebellion, and thereby forfeited his estates, they remained in the Crown till the reign of King James the Second when they were restored to his grandson Colonel Bryan M'Gauran, for the assistance he afforded that monarch during the stand he made in Ireland against King William. The revolution which succeeded, prevented my grandfather from reaping any benefit from James's gracious intentions, and he had the mortification to see the estates which had just been granted him, bestowed by William on those who had favoured his cause. And such was his hapless fate, that bereft of his title and property, he was even obliged to become a tenant of a small part of those lands his ancestors had for many centuries been Lords of. My father succeeded my grandfather in his farm; but so inexperienced were the natives of that part of Ireland, then, in the art of agriculture; or so indolent was he, and so loath to abate of that hospitality to which he had always been accustomed, that he gave up the lease of an estate, as not being worth holding, that now brings in to its present possessor, the Earl of Tyrone, between seven and eight hundred a year. In the same work Major Edward also refers to Bryan's brother Captain Donell M√°g Samhradh√°in- On my first arrival at Prague, I had given out, with truth, that I was a grandson of Colonel Bryan M'Gauran, who had followed the fortunes of James King of England, and served in his army ‚Äî and as Hugh, the son of Captain Daniel M'Gauran, my great uncle, had married the lady first mentioned (Mary O'Donnell), my cousin, his son, was consequently cousin-german to the two Generals, and had always reported himself to be a grandson of Colonel Bryan M'Gauran, in order to give himself the greater consequence; it was therefore concluded that I was this gentleman's brother. He had early in life entered into the Austrian service, in which he had attained the rank of Captain; but having been taken prisoner by the Prussians, was at that time at Magdeburg. Knowing that I was nearly allied to the two Generals, though not the son of their aunt, I did not give myself the trouble to contradict the supposition. In 1854 John O'Hara stated- Bryan Magauran was the last that held a fragment of the Ballymagauran property. His family can be traced.(Reference No. 24 O 39/JOD/ 289) References Irish lords People from County Cavan 17th-century Irish people Irish soldiers ","title":"Colonel Bryan Magauran"},{"id":"51087344","text":"The Whitehead Lifesaving Station was a maritime rescue facility on Whitehead Island, an island off the coast of St. George, Maine at the mouth of Penobscot Bay. Established in 1874 by the United States Life-Saving Service, its original building is one of the best-preserved of the five stations built by the service on the coast of Maine and New Hampshire at that time. The station was in active use until the 1940s, and is now privately owned. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history Whitehead Island is a island off the northeastern coast of St. George, near the southwestern approach to Penobscot Bay. In addition to the former lifesaving station, the island is also home to Whitehead Light, located at its southeastern point. The lifesaving station is located near the southwestern point of the island, between it and a small peninsula jutting to the south. Its historic features include the original 1874 building, located near the water, and a 1922 residential structure set further inland. Between these two structures is a small parade ground which was used by the station crews for drills; part of this ground includes the foundation point where a \\"wreck pole\\" was mounted, simulating the mast of a ship. The 1874 building is a two-story rectangular wood frame structure with decorative Italianate features, while the 1922 residence is a modest vernacular two-story building with a hip roof. with The original 1874 building was probably designed by Francis Chandler, who was employed in the Office of the Supervising Architect of the United States Treasury Department. The 1922 building was probably designed by Victor Mendelhoff, the principal architect of the United States Life-Saving Service from 1896. The Life-Saving Service was merged into the United States Coast Guard, which closed the facility about 1944, selling it into private ownership. Most of Whitehead Island is privately owned, with a conservation easement protecting most of it. The facilities of the station are rented by the owners to the Pine Island Camp, which owns the lighthouse complex and conducts trips to the island.

It was known for selling official scripts and film cells directly from Desilu Productions during the run of the series. It later expanded into general Star Trek merchandise under Majel Barrett, and has since subsumed into Roddenberry.com. History Following the second season of the original Star Trek series, fan Bjo Trimble led efforts in 1967 to ensure that the show was renewed for a third season. Part of this effort was the creation of Star Trek Enterprises, in conjunction between Trimble and the show's creator, Gene Roddenberry. Through the help of Roddenberry, the company sold mail order Star Trek merchandise, which was obtained directly from the studio. Another claim to the foundation of the company was after a letter from science fiction writer Isaac Asimov to Roddenberry was mislaid among fan mail, and he received a photograph of the cast in response. Majel Barrett took over control of Lincoln Enterprises from Bjo Trimble At the time, Roddenberry's marriage to his first wife, Eileen, was rapidly collapsing; the couple would soon divorce. In preparation for this eventuality, Roddenberry created Lincoln and put it in the name of Majel Barrett, who had been his mistress since she had played Number One in the show's original pilot episode, and later the recurring character of Nurse Christine Chapel, as well as providing the voice for the ship's computer. If the company was in her name, its assets and profits would not be community property under California law and thus beyond Eileen's reach in a divorce. The company advertised copies of the Star Trek pitch and show bible, and a catalog with \\"items never before available from a TV show! Exciting photos, actual scripts, film clips, fun bumper stickers, and MORE!\\". The scripts were additional copies from the print runs at the studio, after more were ordered each time than necessary with the additional scripts sold on by the company. Star Trek Enterprises specialized in film frames, which were either bought as clips or as single mounted frames, which Trimble realized were popular at a science fiction convention she attended. These were sourced from the editing rooms at Desilu, however this caused a problem during the third season as film editor Don Rode required a shot of the USS Enterprise traveling at warp speed. He had remembered this being shown during the first season and sought to re- use it. He visited the vaults at Desilu, where the old footage was meant to be stored but upon entering, found it to be empty. When he asked a security guard, he was told that Roddenberry and Barrett had cleared it out the day before, claiming the studio was going to destroy it. Desilu was alerted, but no action was taken. The strips were then processed and sold on by the company. Nine months after the company was founded, Roddenberry fired Bjo Trimble and her husband John, who had by then built most of the mailing lists from the names and addresses they had collected from all across the country to save the show from cancellation and produced most of its sales materials. While John Trimble says it was merely a disagreement over the company's direction, Roddenberry biographer Joel Engel believes Roddenberry always intended to replace them. Their replacement, Stephen Whitfield, a marketing executive with AMT, a Michigan company that had made considerable profit from selling Star Trek-themed models, was corresponding with Roddenberry regularly about the future direction of the company before the Trimbles were fired, while working in an office across the hall where he was ostensibly researching The Making of Star Trek, a book cocredited to Roddenberry although Whitfield was the sole writer. Whitfield was paid more than the Trimbles had been; he was also still on AMT's payroll at that time. Roddenberry's letters to Whitfield indicate a plan to suggest to Paramount Pictures, which had bought Desilu, that it could make more money from Star Trek by hiring Star Trek Enterprises to replace the company that had handled the show's fan mail for a lower cost, and eventually no fee whatsoever. They would tell Paramount that the revenue from the \\"fan kits\\" sent out in response to fam letters was declining, although Roddenberry knew that interest in the show remained high. He believed Paramount's executives would \\"grab for pennies and forget the dollars\\", preferring a short-term savings to long-term profits. After the change in management, the company was renamed to Lincoln Enterprises. This name was attributed to Roddenberry's love of Abraham Lincoln. Barrett would later claim that the company was far older than it was, saying it was first known as Lincoln Publishing and owned by someone else. It then transferred into the hands of Leonard Maizlish, Roddenberry's personal lawyer. She said that it was handed from Maizlish to her in the early 1980s. The method of cutting the film strips changed under Barrett, as she thought it made it more authentic to have the cuts be less precise. This led to fan complaints, because cuts were taken part way through frames above and below the intended frame. Other products included an \\"official\\" newsletter, Inside Star Trek, a flight deck certificate and a copy of the original pitch document for the series. The product range was increased in the early 1990s from props and technical documents to more general merchandise. Tribble toys were purchased for use in the production of the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode \\"Trials and Tribble-ations\\" from the company in 1996. The company eventually became roddenberry.com. In 2010, the remaining film clip collection of the company was sold at auction by Julien's Auctions at the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in Las Vegas.

Some shot timers can be linked to big board displays to provide instant feedback to the audience. A shot timer is a shot activated timer used in shooting sports, which starts the competitor by an audible signal and also records the competitor's time electronically by detecting the sound of each shot together with the time from the start signal. When the competitor is finished the timer will show the time from the start signal until the last shot. The time is usually recorded to hundredths of a second (centisecond), which is required by competitions in the International Practical Shooting Confederation.IPSC 2016 Handgun Rules, section 9.2.1.1  History  Shooting Illustrated :: Shot Timers - The Time of Your LifeIn 1924 Ed McGivern set a world record by firing six shots from a double-action revolver in four-fifths of a second. This time was measured with a complicated timing contraption attached to the revolver. This timing system was too complicated to be adapted in every day shooting or shooting sports. Shooters began using stopwatches to time shooting, often paired with a \\"stop plate\\" (a steel target engaged at the end of a shooting stage) to try to measure the total shooting timer. In 1981, popular shooter and holster maker Bill Rodgers invented a new timing device that provided a start signal and an adjustable preset \\"par\\" end time. The goal being making all the required shots between the start and end signals of the timer. Soon after Ron Bailey of Competition Electronics built a timer with an included microphone that was able to mark the time of each shot fired. In 1982, Ronin Colman created the PACT Championship Timer. Throughout the next two decades, shooters would transition from the stopwatches to shot timers and a new market was created. Outside of competitive shooting, the adaptation and use of a shot timer are still relatively low. A study conducted in 2019 showed 82% of shooters surveyed do not use a shot timer at all, and 14.5% did not know what a shot timer was.ConcealedCarry.com :: Shot Timer Survey Results  Common Features and Functions  Some timers come with additional functions:Shot Timer Features * Par times: The timer first gives a start, then a stop signal after a pre- programmed time. * Instant or delayed start signal: The start signal can either come instantly by the push of the start button, or by a delay of a programmed number of seconds or within a range of seconds. * Big board display: The possibility for direct connection to a big board display for instant audience feedback. * Integration with an application on a mobile device such as RangeTech or Practiscore via Bluetooth. * The possibility for scoring points on target in addition to the time, with automatic hit factor calculation, making for a complete scoring solution.

Traditional mobile phones and tablets lack the necessary style and quality of microphone to pick up gunshots; especially in a gun range where there are multiple shooters or at an indoor gun range where the sound is greater and the echo can also create a false positive on the timer. However, many shooters use a mobile app-based shot timer only for its par function when conducting dry fire practice in which there is no need to pick up the sound of gunfire.

St. Berrihert's Kyle is an ecclesiastical enclosure and National Monument containing cross slabs, wheel crosses, high crosses and a cursing stone located in County Tipperary, Ireland.http://www.megalithomania.com/show/site/1238/st_berriherts_kyle_high_cross.htm Location St. Berrihert's Kyle is located in the Glen of Aherlow at the foot of the Galtee Mountains, southwest of Bansha. History St. Berrihert's Kyle is named after Saint Berrihert (Berrahert, Bernihardt, Bericheart), an Anglo-Saxon holy man who is traditionally believed to have come to the Glen after the Synod of Whitby (AD 664), and in some biographies is the brother of Gerald of Mayo (d. 731). Many Saxon monks came to the region after the controversy at that synod over the dating of Easter. He is probably the same man as St Berichter, the patron of an early medieval ecclesiastical site at Tullylease, County Cork. A cross slab there mentions Beirchachtuire, an Irish version of the Anglo-Saxon name Beorhtwine (\\"bright friend\\"). The Annals of the Four Masters mention the death of Berichtir of Tulach Leis on 6 December 839; this could be an error for 739. His feast day is February 18. A vast collection of stone cross slabs and other monuments were placed in the Kyle (from Irish cill, \\"church\\"; a medieval church once stood on the spot). Description St. Berrihert's Kyle is a stone enclosure containing a variety of stone monuments: 72 slabs, fragments of a bullaun stone, four wheel crosses, the head and base of a high cross, the head of a small cross and a slab with an incomplete inscription on it. It is possible that the walls of the church were taken away for other building use, but the carved stones were considered sacred and so were left on site.

Bred and originally owned by the Aga Khan she was unraced as a two-year-old and won one minor race as a three-year-old in 2011 before being sold at auction. In 2012 she emerged as a top-class racemare, winning the Sun Chariot Stakes in England and the E. P. Taylor Stakes in Canada as well as finishing third in the Falmouth Stakes and fourth in the Prix Jean Romanet. After her retirement from racing she was sold and exported to Japan. Background Siyouma is a bay mare with a white star and a white sock on her left hind leg bred in Ireland by her owner Aga Khan IV. His sire Medicean was an outstanding miler whose wins included the Lockinge Stakes, Queen Anne Stakes and Eclipse Stakes. His other offspring have included Nannina, Dutch Art, Al Shemali (Dubai Duty Free Stakes), Capponi (Al Maktoum Challenge, Round 3) and Mr Medici (Champions & Chater Cup). Siyouma's dam Sichilla showed great promise in a brief racing career, winning two of her three races including the Listed Prix Amandine, and as a broodmare, she also produced Siyouni, a colt who won the Prix Jean-Luc Lagard√®re in 2007. She was distantly descended from the influential American broodmare Blue Filly. Siyouma was sent to race in France and entered training with Alain de Royer- Dupr√©, Racing career =2011: three-year-old season= Siyouma did not race as a two-year-old, making her debut in a maiden race over 2000 metres at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse on 16 May in which she finished fourth of the seventeen runners behind Arisk. Four weeks later she started 8/5 favourite for a similar event over the same distance at Longchamp Racecourse. Ridden as on her debut by Christophe Lemaire, she won by a head from Un Jour and nine others. The filly did not race again in 2011 and in December she was put up for auction at the Arqana sale in Deauville. She was bought for ‚Ç¨220,000 by the trainer Fran√ßois Doumen and entered the ownership of the English businessman and horse breeder Robert Jeffcock. =2012: four-year-old season= On her first appearance as a four-year-old, Siyouma contested a minor stakes race over 2000 metres at Compi√®gne on 12 March and won \\"easing down\\" by two lengths from the seven-year-old gelding Le Roi Mage. Two weeks later she finished third to Pagera and Haya Landa in the Prix Banassa at Saint-Cloud Racecourse and on April 27 she ran fourth behind Aiavoski in the Listed Vase d'Argent at Toulouse. On 28 May she was stepped up in class for the Group Two Prix Corrida at Saint-Cloud and started a 28/1 outsider in a ten-runner field. Ridden by Thierry Jarnet she stayed on strongly in the straight to take third place, beaten a nose and three quarters of a length by Solemia and Shareta. In all of her subsequent races, Siyouma was ridden by Gerald Mosse. In July she was sent to England and brought back in distance for the Group One Falmouth Stakes over one mile at Newmarket Racecourse. Starting at odds of 33/1 she was restrained by Mosse in the early stages before staying on to take third behind Giofra and Elusive Kate with the unplaced horses including Maybe and Golden Lilac. On her return to France in August she finished fifth behind Snow Fairy, Izzi Top, Galikova and Timepiece in the Prix Jean Romanet although she was later promoted to fourth when the \\"winner\\" tested positive for a banned substance. On 29 September Siyouma returned to Newmarket for the Group One Sun Chariot Stakes and started at odds of 12/1 in an eight-runner field. The Poule d'Essai des Pouliches winner Beauty Parlour started favourite ahead of Elusive Kate whilst the other runners were Chachamaidee (Matron Stakes), Up (Blandford Stakes), Laugh Out Loud (Prix de Sandringham), Gamilati (Cherry Hinton Stakes, UAE 1000 Guineas) and La Collina (Phoenix Stakes). Mosse settled the filly in second place as Laugh Out Loud set the early pace. Siyouma took the lead a furlong out and held off a challenge from Elusive Kate to win by three quarters of a length with Laugh Out Loud holding on to take third ahead of La Collina. Doumen commented \\"She is the most satisfactory thing in the world. She is easy to train, she has an easy temperament and is very calm. Gerald said that she won with something in hand and nobody will be able to criticise his ride today. She could go for the EP Taylor at Woodbine in two weeks' time as we could get some cut in the ground there. She is better on softer ground. But the fact that she has won today reassures me that we could look at Hong Kong or Japan\\". When it was pointed out that her owner was English he responded \\"nobody is perfect\\". Siyouma was then sent to Canada to contest the Grade I E. P. Taylor Stakes over a mile and a quarter at Woodbine Racetrack on 14 October and started favourite in a thirteen-runner field which included runners from Canada, the United States, England, Ireland and France. The best fancied of her opponents were Dream Peace (Prix de la Nonette, runner-up in the Diana Stakes), Princess Highway (Ribblesdale Stakes) and Barefoot Lady (Nell Gwyn Stakes, Canadian Stakes). After racing in mid-division, Siyouma was switched to the outside, took the lead a furlong and a half from the finish and won in \\"imressive\\" style by one and three quarter lengths and a neck from Pagera and Dream Peace. After the race Doumen commented \\"She's so good and she's so calm. She has got such a wonderful temperament that it allows her to travel beautifully well and takes all the effort away\\". On her final appearance, Siyouma was sent to Sha Tin Racecourse for the Hong Kong Mile on 9 December. She never looked likely to win and could not recover after being hampered in the straight, finishing eleventh of the twelve runners behind Ambitious Dragon. Breeding record At the end of her racing career Siyouma was sold to the Yoshida family's Northern Farm and exported to become a broodmare in Japan. In her first three seasons she was covered by Deep Impact. She produced bay colts in 2014 and 2015 followed by a bay filly in 2016.

She was part of the group that formed the Asociaci√≥n Nacional de Educadores (ANDE) (National Association of Educators) and fought for women's enfranchisement. After winning the vote, she helped found the National Liberation Party of Costa Rica and was one of the first three women elected as a Deputy of the Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica. In 2002, Obreg√≥n was honored as one of the inaugural group of women inducted into La Galer√≠a de las Mujeres de Costa Rica (The Women's Gallery of Costa Rica).

Career Obreg√≥n began teaching the following year at the Escuela Superior de Ni√±as N¬∞ 2 (Girl's High School #2), which later became Escuela Julia Lang (Julia Lang High School). She taught at the school until 1916 and the following year married the educator and intellectual , who was the first director of the country's Normal School. The couple had four children, , Omar, Gabriel and Mar√≠a Eugenia and raised them in the city of Heredia. Jorge (1918-2012) would become Vice President of Costa Rica, Gabriel (1922‚Äì1999) would become an acclaimed geologist and Mar√≠a Eugenia (1926-2014) became an educator, Minister of Education and Dean of the Education Faculty at the University of Costa Rica. During the early years Obreg√≥n was raising her family, she did not teach, but collaborated with her husband in literary and student magazines, such as Universo and Nosotros. Dengo died in 1928 and Obreg√≥n returned to teaching to support her family. She first taught elementary students at the Argentine School of Heredia and then in 1929 began teaching at the Normal School of Costa Rica, while she was studying for her examinations to become a professor. Passing the tests in 1932, Obreg√≥n became the geography and guidance professor at the Normal School. After four years of teaching at the Normal School, she moved to San Jos√© and taught at the Escuela Rep√∫blica del Per√∫, where she remained until her retirement in 1941. After her retirement, Obreg√≥n continued to teach privately and began working with activists and organizers to improve the education system and political access of women in the country. She was one of the co-founders of the Asociaci√≥n Nacional de Educadores (ANDE)(National Association of Educators) and she served on the Board of Education for San Jos√©. In 1943, she joined with students and women in the protests known as the \\"Women of May 15\\" to oppose prohibitions to women's political participation and press for suffrage. In 1947, Obreg√≥n joined Emma Gamboa and they organized a group of women including Clarisa Blanco, Rosario Brenes de Facio, Amalia Chavarr√≠a de Rossi, Claudia Cort√©s, Aurelia Pinto de Ross, Mar√≠a del Rosario Quir√≥s Salazar, Etilma Romero de Segura, Cristina Salazar de Esquivel, and Marta Uribe de Pag√©s to demonstrate with around 5,000 other participants against electoral irregularities and fraud in the upcoming election in 1948. The elections sparked the Costa Rican Civil War and at war's end, women finally gained the right to vote and participate in politics. Between 1948 and 1952, Obreg√≥n served in the Ministry of Education overseeing baccalaureate exams and in 1951 served as a delegate of the Inter-American Commission of Women. That same year, she became a co- founder of the National Liberation Party () and headed the Women's Committee for the party. Obreg√≥n was one of the first three women delegates to win a seat in the Costa Rican legislature, when in 1953, the first election in which women were allowed to vote, she, Ana Rosa Chac√≥n and Estela Quesada won seats in the House of Deputies. She served as first Secretary of the Board of the Legislative Assembly and is credited as the first woman to deliver a speech in the Legislative Assembly. Obreg√≥n died in office on 29 September 1956 before her term had expired. Legacy In 2002, Obreg√≥n was inducted into La Galer√≠a de las Mujeres de Costa Rica (The Women's Gallery of Costa Rica) as one of the inaugural group of women for her contributions to education and founding of the national teacher's association. The National Development Plan adopted in 2010, to improve the infrastructure and guide the country's governance, bears her name.

History Prior to its independence in 1947, Pakistan was part of the colonial British Raj empire in South Asia. British control of the region began with the annexation of Sind in 1843, the Punjab and North-West Frontier in 1849, and Baluchistan in 1876. The colonial period expanded European presence and influence in South Asia. Thousands of European settlers arrived in the subcontinent as administrators, soldiers, officials, civilians, missionaries and traders. During the 1940s, there were small populations of European Jews scattered across cosmopolitan cities such as Karachi and Lahore. They arrived as part of the Jewish exodus to British India following the outbreak of World War II in Europe. However, by the late 1960s, most of these Jews effected a secondary migration and left for Israel or Western nations. The terms gora, firangi or angrez are used in Pakistan to refer to a White person. Demographics The following sections outline current expatriate European communities in Pakistan, sorted by their geographical region of origin. =Central Europe= The Swiss community in Pakistan numbered 336 people as of 2014, based on embassy registrations. There is also a small Austrian expatriate group. Czechs in Pakistan are a minor community consisting of expatriates, and Czech nationals married to Pakistanis. A Czech Film Club was set up in Islamabad by the Czech embassy, as of 2004. It arranged screenings of Czech films for Czechs living in Pakistan as well as Czech-speakers. There is also a minor German community as well. =Eastern Europe= There is a very small Ukrainian community in the country, numbering a few dozen. It includes businesspersons, journalists, diplomats and Ukrainian spouses married to Pakistanis. Most of them reside in metropolitan cities. The Russian community in Pakistan is a small one, and has been present since the Soviet era. There are also White Pakistanis of Armenian and Turkish descent There are some Romanians, concentrated in Islamabad. =Northern Europe= Northern European expatriates in Pakistan primarily consist of Scandinavian communities. A pattern of return-migration is observed among Danes of Pakistani origin, of whom some families have settled in Pakistan. Around 100 other Danes were living in Pakistan as of 2006. There were also around 200 Swedes in Pakistan, and they are spread throughout the country. The population of Finns in Pakistan is fewer in number. A Norwegian diaspora is present in the country, a large number of them being Norwegians of Pakistani descent. Up to 4,000 Norwegian citizens live in Pakistan. The town of Kharian in Gujrat district of Punjab is known as \\"Little Norway\\", as the majority of Pakistani-Norwegians hail from this area and many of them have resettled here. Others split their time between Norway and Pakistan. They have established family businesses and built large houses in the town, including those who have moved back to Pakistan post-retirement. Remittances and investment by Norwegians have boosted the town's economy and real estate. Those who are more accustomed to urban living prefer owning houses in larger cities such as Islamabad and Lahore. Private schools in Kharian supported by the embassy provide Norwegian-language classes to the children of Norwegian citizens, making assimilation easier when the expatriates return to Norway. According to Statistics Norway, one-in-three Pakistani-Norwegian youth spend at least a year or more in Pakistan, gaining key exposure to their cultural roots. The Norwegian community maintains keen interest in politics back home and observes the country's national events. =Southern Europe= As of 2010, 300 Italian nationals were residing in Pakistan. Some Italians are notable in the region's history as empire mercenaries, such as Paolo Avitabile and Jean-Baptiste Ventura who served in Punjab and the Frontier under Ranjit Singh. There is a small Spaniard population in Pakistan, mainly confined to Islamabad. There is also a minor Portuguese community residing in Karachi. The community is known for establishing missionary schools, and for its contribution to the country's pop music scene. The Portuguese presence in South Asia dates back to the start of the 16th century, following the rise of the Portuguese Empire. The empire did not control any regions that are part of modern Pakistan. However, it did possess colonies in India (most notably Goa), and made a series of incursions along Pakistan's present southern coastline. In 1568, the Portuguese led by admiral Fern√£o Mendes Pinto attacked Debal (near Thatta) when they encountered Ottoman traders' ships anchored at the port. =Western Europe= In 2005, over 47,000 Britons resided in Pakistan. By 2015, their population was 80,000, making them by far the largest Western community. They comprise English and smaller numbers of Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish expatriates. The community also includes a large number of British Pakistanis who have resettled in Pakistan. The city of Mirpur in Kashmir, where the majority of British Pakistanis originate from, is called \\"Little Britain\\" due to its expatriate British population. Colonial-era buildings, infrastructure, laws, institutions, governance and culture left by the British exist throughout Pakistan as a legacy of the empire. Irish people have been present in the South Asian subcontinent since the days of the East India Company. Many of them served as soldiers and government officials for the colonial empire. Around half of the British forces in the subcontinent consisted of Irish manpower. Others became renowned as educators, nurses and Christian missionaries. This tradition continues today, as several convent schools in Pakistan are run by Irish nuns ‚Äì such as the Convents of Jesus and Mary in Karachi, Lahore and Murree, or the Presentation Convent Schools in Punjab founded by the Presentation Sisters. Many Roman Catholic missionaries from Ireland have been working in Pakistan for decades, and are involved in social work or provision of services to the country's Christian community. Irish expatriates also work as medical volunteers or have occupied key positions representing international organisations such as the United Nations. Notable Irish-Pakistanis include Sister John Berchmans Conway who became a teacher, and Jennifer Musa who married into the Qazi family and entered politics ‚Äì earning the title \\"Queen of Balochistan.\\" Among other Western European diasporas include a small French community as well. Organisations European countries have embassies in Islamabad, while some also have deputy missions in Karachi and Lahore. In addition, the European Union is represented in Pakistan through a delegated mission.

Between 1969 and 1989 he was the director of the East Berlin based Institute for Marxism‚ÄìLeninism. G√ºnter Heyden was born in Stargard, a small industrial town and railway junction a short distance to the east of Stettin. His father was a qualified oven engineer. After leaving school he trained for and entered his father's profession. In 1941 he was conscripted for military service. In March 1945 he was captured by the Americans and then transferred to the Soviets, spending the nearly five years, till December 1949, as a prisoner of war. During his final six months of detention, between July and December 1949, he benefitted from a period of political education at a Soviet Antifascist Academy. He returned early in 1950 to what had recently, in October 1949, been relaunched as the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), a separated Soviet sponsored German state with political and socio-economic structures consciously modelled on those of the Soviet Union itself. He promptly joined the new nation's ruling Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED). In 1950/51 he taught at the Trades Union Federation Academy in Beesenstedt, latterly serving as the institution's deputy head. Between 1952 and 1956 he studied at the Party Central Committee's prestigious Institute for Social Sciences (\\"Institut f√ºr Gesellschaftswissenschaften beim ZK der SED\\" / IfG) - as it was known at that time - emerging with a doctorate. He remained at the institute, now with a succession of teaching posts, for another decade. Between 1957 and 1964, and again between 1966 and 1969, he held the top teaching chair for Marxist‚ÄìLeninist philosophy. In 1962 he was appointed Professor of historical materialism at the institute.

Without an official name, the alliance is informally called Yit Po Shing () in Chinese, taking one word from each of the member organisation's name or ideology. The alliance's common platform is \\"Creating a de facto referendum in five constituencies; allow all citizens to participate in the creation of constitution\\". The alliance was dissolved after the election, in which one member of Civic Passion was elected. Background Wong Yuk-man and Wong Yeung-tat previously contested the 2012 election under the flag of People Power. While Wong Yuk-man was elected, Wong Yeung-tat suffered a narrow defeat. People Power was then transformed from an electoral alliance into a political party, through a coalition of several parties. After the election, Wong Yeung-tat cut ties with People Power and expanded Civic Passion, which had been established as part of his own election campaign. Wong Yuk-man's Proletariat Political Institute (PPI) was a founding member of People Power; however, his disagreement with People Power over the 2014 electoral reform and Occupy Central action plans saw the breakaway of PPI in 2013. Chin Wan, considered one of the pioneers of localist political thought for his \\"Hong Kong City-State Theory\\", founded the Hong Kong Resurgence Order in 2014 with the aim of \\"restoring Chinese civilisation\\". Alliance The New Territories East by-election early in 2016 was the first time a candidate contesting under a localist banner. Supported by many organisations in the localist camp and boosted by the Mong Kok civil unrest, Hong Kong Indigenous's Edward Leung received 15% of the votes. Despite failure in winning a seat, its better-than-expected results encouraged the localist camp to actively field candidate to contest the general election in September. On 29 February 2016, the day after the by-election, Civic Passion (CP), Proletariat Political Institute (PPI) and Hong Kong Resurgence Order (HKRO) jointly announced they would form an alliance to contest all of the 5 geographical constituencies. The candidates include: * Hong Kong Island: Alvin Cheng (CP), Bonix Chung (CP) * Kowloon West: Wong Yuk-man (PPI), Ma Yu-sang (PPI) * Kowloon East: Wong Yeung-tat (CP) * New Territories West: Cheng Chung- tai (CP), Cheung Yiu-sum (CP) * New Territories East: Chin Wan (HKRO), Marco Lee (CP) Ideology The ideology of the alliance is mostly based on Chin's \\"City-State Theory\\". Instead of striving for independence from China, they advocated a constitutional reform by all citizens through a de facto referendum, in the form of a by-election triggered by one legislator resigning from each of the five geographical constituencies. After the amendment to the Basic Law was accepted by the communist party, the autonomy of Hong Kong would be guaranteed even after the original deadline of 2047.  Results  Of the 5 candidate lists fielded by the alliance, only one was returned to the Legislative Council. Cheng Chung-tai was elected to represent New Territories West with a 9.03% support, while incumbent legislator Wong Yuk-man suffered a narrow defeat of 424 votes to Yau Wai-ching of Youngspiration (ALLinHK). After ending again at the 6th place in the 5-seat Kowloon East constituency, Wong Yeung-tat resigned from the leadership of Civic Passion, to be succeeded by Cheng Chung-tai. As the movement leader, Wong Yeung-tat conceded defeat and admitted a lack of public support for their constitutional movement. The alliance was dissolved after the 2016 LegCo election, as announced by Chin Wan on 5 September 2016. Proletariat Political Institute would provide political training for the youth.

He was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the eldest surviving son of Captain John Willshire by Mary, daughter of William Linden of Dublin. His father, a soldier himself, purchased Thomas' Army commission in the 38th Foot when he was only 6 years old. He joined the regiment in the West Indies in 1798, returned with it to England and attended schools in King's Lynn and Kensington. He was promoted captain in 1804, joined the regiment in South America and took part in the attack on Buenos Aires. He then went with the regiment to Portugal in 1808, where he fought at Roli√ßa, Vimiero, and Coru√±a. In 1809 he served in the Walcheren Campaign, where his father died. In June 1812 the first battalion of the 38th embarked for the Iberian Peninsula, with Willshire commanding the light company. It joined the Royal Regiment and the 9th Foot in the 5th (Leith's) division three days before the Battle of Salamanca, where Willshire was twice wounded. He commanded the light companies of the brigade in the action on the Carrion on 25 October during the retreat from Burgos. In 1813 the division formed part of Graham's corps at the Vittoria and the Siege of San Sebastian. There the 38th was assigned the lesser breach in the first assault and was held in reserve in the second assault, although soon brought up in support of the stormers. He commanded the light companies of the brigade at the passage of the Bidasoa, the Battle of the Nive (9‚Äì11 December) and the repulse of the sortie from Bayonne (14 April 1814). He received a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy, and afterwards the Peninsular silver medal with seven clasps. In 1815 his battalion was sent to the Netherlands, but was too late for the Battle of Waterloo and instead went on to Paris, where Willshire was employed for a short time on the staff. In December he returned with the battalion to England and in June 1818 went with it to the Cape. On his way out he wrote a manual of 'light company man≈ìuvres in concert with battalion man≈ìuvres' which was sent to Sir Henry Torrens and was probably used by him in preparing the drill-book of 1824. Early in 1819 Willshire was sent to the frontier as commandant of British Kaffraria. A quarrel between the chiefs, in which the British authorities intervened, led to a well-planned attack on Grahamstown by Mokana with six thousand Kaffirs on 22 April. The attack was repulsed by a company of the 38th and 240 local troops and Mokana forced to surrender, after which the territory between the Great Fish River and the Keiskamma River was added to the colony and Fort Willshire built upon it. In 1822 the 38th were sent to Calcutta and in 1823 Willshire was given a majority without purchase in the 46th Foot, which he commanded for some time at Bellary. In December 1824 he commanded a brigade in the force under Colonel Deacon which retook the fort at Kittoor. On 30 August 1827 he was made lieutenant colonel without purchase of the 2nd (Queen's), stationed at Poona, serving with that regiment for nearly ten years. Order of the Dooranee Empire received by Thomas Willshire On 10 January 1837, he was made brevet colonel, with the local rank of brigadier general in India. In 1838, while commanding a brigade at Poona, he was given one in the 'Army of the Indus,' formed for the invasion of Afghanistan. In February 1839 the army was reorganised and Willshire was given the command of the Bombay division of infantry. His troops were the last to cross the Bolan, reaching Quetta on 30 April, and Kandahar on 4 May. He took part in the storming of Ghazni on 23 July and went on to Kabul. On the return journey, after having been presented with the Order of the Dooranee Empire, he was told to depose Mehrab Khan of Kelat, which he achieved by storming his fort, in the process of which Mehrab Khan was killed. He was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1839 and created a baronet (Willshire of the East Indies) for the capture of Kelat. He returned to England in 1840, retired from the Queen's regiment on half-pay, and was appointed commandant at Chatham. He remained there till 1846 when he was promoted major general. He was made colonel of the 51st Foot on 26 June 1849, promoted lieutenant general on 20 June 1854 and general on 20 April 1861. He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 28 June 1861. He died on 31 May 1862 at Hill House, near Windsor.

He went to the \\"Italian Navy Academy\\" and graduated as the best student. At the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish war, Cerrina Feroni obtained the command of the Italian naval forces stationed in the Red Sea. Also in these operations the commander Cerrina proved skilled as he managed to convince the sheikhs of Yemen to rebel against the Ottoman Empire, obtaining new allies and always putting in greater difficulty the enemy, until May 6, 1912 when the Italian fleet won the Turkish one in the Battle of Kunfuda Bay (today Al Qunfudhah). It was an operation that earned Cerrina Feroni the appointment as \\"Officer of the Military Order of Savoy\\". At the end of this clash, the Italian Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti personally requested the captain Cerrina asking him to perform on behalf of the government some secret diplomacy missions in 1913. Subsequently Cerrina Feroni passed to the \\"Ministry of the Colonies\\", where he remained for several years, first as governor of Eritrea and then going to the same office in Somalia (from 1916 to 1920). During WW1 he was appointed governor of Eritrea from 17 August 1915 to 16 September 1916; he did a second term in Asmara from 14 April 1921 to 1 June 1923.

The group was initially formed as a doo-wop trio in Adams Morgan, Washington, D.C. under the name The Dreams, but evolved into a self contained funk and soul band. In 1973 they were set to release their debut album Who's Gonna Save the World, but their management company folded and the band was unable to find a record label. In 1979 they released their self-titled debut album under the record label Mercury Records. The album was produced by Wayne Henderson formerly of the Crusaders and co- produced by Augie Johnson of the group Side Effect. The group spent 3 months in L.A. recording at Ocean Way Studios, with Wayne Henderson adding a host of other musicians to the recording like Keyboardists Bobby Lyle and Dean Gant. The production added a slicker, L.A. horn driven sound, but took away from the raw East Coast feel, which was a trademark of the band. A lack of effort and money on the part of the label to promote the album, resulted in it not taking off as planned. Father's Children continued to play the role of opening act for all the major acts, locally and throughout the U.S.. The story continues with the changing of personnel through the years, but the two lead vocalist are still keeping the name and sound alive. The group has two recordings, done on their label, Sky's the Limit and Love and Life stories. Who's Gonna Save the World was released by archive music label The Numero Group. The group received attention once again when their song \\"Dirt and Grime\\" was used by Kanye West as a sample for the track \\"Facts\\" from his 2016 studio album The Life of Pablo.

In theology  In Islamic theology, tafwid (or tafwid al- amr li-llah, relegation of matters to God) is a doctrine according to which the meanings of the ambiguous verses of the Qur'an should be consigned to God alone. Those who follow this school do not utilize metaphorical interpretation, rather they leave problematic texts uninterpreted, believing that the reality of their meaning should be left to the one who said them, implying their unknowability. The doctrine of tafwid, which was held by a number of classical scholars such as al-Ghazali and whose origin they attributed to the salaf (exemplary early Muslims), states that the Quranic expressions such as 'God's hands' or 'face' do not carry the literal meanings like their counterparts in human beings. Rather they are attributes or qualities of God and not organs like the face or hands of human beings. Other classical figures who subscribed to this doctrine were Ibn Qudamah, Suyuti, Ahmad Ibn Hanbal and Ibn Kathir. The latter discusses Tafwid as follows: > People have said a great deal on this topic and this is not the place to > expound on what they have said. On this matter, we follow the early Muslims > (salaf): Malik, Awza'i, Thawri, Layth ibn Sa'd, Shafi'i, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, > Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh, and others among the Imams of the Muslims, both ancient > and modern that is, to let (the verse in question) pass as it has come, > without saying how it is meant (min ghayr takyif), without likening it to > created things (wa la tashbih), and without nullifying it (wa la ta'til): > The literal meaning (zahir) that occurs to the minds of anthropomorphists > (al-mushabbihin) is negated of Allah, for nothing from His creation > resembles Him: \\"There is nothing whatsoever like unto Him, and He is the > All-Hearing, the All-Seeing\\" (Qur'an 42:11) The precise nature of tafwid has been subject to debate among Muslim scholars. The followers of Ibn Taymiyya, including contemporary Salafis, hold that only the modality of the attributes should be consigned to God (tafwid al- kayfiyya), while the literal sense of the attributes should be accepted according to their lexical meaning in the Arabic language. Thus they argue that the salaf accepted that God has a hand, because the meaning of the word \\"hand\\" (yad) was known, but without assuming that God's hand is comparable to a human hand, or asking how or why that is. In contrast, anti-Salafi scholars reject this distinction and accept tafwid without qualification.  Divorce In Islamic personal status law, tafwid refers to a sub-type of divorce (talaq al-tafwid or tafwid al-talaq) in which the power of talaq (the type of divorce normally initiated by the husband) is delegated to the wife. This delegation can be made at the time of drawing up the marriage contract or during the marriage, with or without conditions. Classical jurists differed as to the validity of different forms of delegation. Most modern Muslim-majority countries permit this type of divorce in some form.  Other uses The term tafwid has also been used in law with various other meanings related to delegation of power, authorization of an act, or issuance of a warrant for arrest.

Camden Parish was formed from Antrim Parish when Pittsylvania County was established in 1767 with 938 white and 316 slave tithables. A tithe paying person was every white or black male (unless a woman had her own business) in the parish, who was required by law to support the local established church.Amos, J.

The early priests were: the Reverend Foulis, who resigned in 1759. The Reverend Alex Gordon was next, and then replaced by the Reverend James Stevenson of Williamsburg, Virginia, who took an absence of three months to go to London to be ordained. In March 1771, the Reverend Lewis Gwilliam became the minister of Camden Parish. Although appointed to the Pittsyvania County Committees of safety (American Revolution), he was suspected of Tory loyalties. Gwilliam was paid a salary by the parish through 1779, but in 1776 there were several requests not to pay his salary. Also suspected of disloyalty to the revolution were John Pigg and Samuel Calland (of whom Callands, Virginia was named). There were some prominent members of the congregation. John Pigg, for whom the Pigg River was named, was a member of the church congregation. So was Colonel William Witcher, a militia officer who led county troops in the Cherokee Expedition in 1776 and 1777, as well as local troops at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse.

Valdemar Sch√∏nheyder M√∏ller Kunstindeks Danmark & Weilbach Kunstnerleksikon It was there he became friends with Vilhelm Hammersh√∏i (1864 ‚Äì1916) and took photographs that became the basis for some of Hammersh√∏i's early paintings. He was, in fact, one of the earliest Danish painters to use photography as an artistic medium. In 1891, he moved to Skagen, where he became acquainted with the Skagen Painters, and remained there until 1893. It was in Skagen that he began his intensive study of the effects of light. In 1894, he went to Paris to join his brother, Tyge, who was an art collector; then settled in Fontainebleau in 1896. He continued his studies of light, producing a series of over thirty works with the sun's direct light as their theme; many depicting the sun as rises, shining through the trees. Sometimes, he would briefly stare at the sun, to recreate the lights and colors induced in his retina. He soon became known as the painter of the sun (Le peintre du Soleil). Although largely forgotten today, he was once a familiar figure at exhibitions, including the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition (1885‚Äì87, 1889‚Äì92), the Salon de la Soci√©t√© Nationale (1895‚Äì1903) and the Expositions Universelles of 1889 and 1900. Throughout his life, he suffered from bipolar episodes. In 1901, he was admitted to √Örhus Sindssygehospital, the psychiatric hospital in Aarhus and remained there until his death in 1905.

Their father was John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, who led the English government from 1550 to 1553 under Edward VI and unsuccessfully tried to establish Lady Jane Grey on the English throne after the King's death in July 1553. For his participation in this venture Henry Dudley was imprisoned in the Tower of London and condemned to death. He was killed in the Battle of St. Quentin shortly after his rehabilitation.  Biography  Henry Dudley was born c. 1531 and was the fifth son of Sir John Dudley, later Viscount Lisle, Earl of Warwick and Duke of Northumberland, and his wife Jane Guildford. The Dudley lineage goes back to a family called Sutton. In the early 14th century they became the lords of Dudley Castle, from whom Henry descended through his paternal grandfather. This was Edmund Dudley, a councillor to Henry VII, who was executed after his royal master's death. Through his father's mother, Elizabeth Grey, Viscountess Lisle, Guildford descended from the Hundred Years War heroes, Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, and John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury. When Henry was born, his father was a knight, in 1537 he became vice-admiral and later Lord Admiral. Under the young King Edward VI, Henry's father became Lord President of the Privy Council and de facto ruled England from 1550 to 1553. In 1542 John Dudley was created Viscount Lisle, later was created Earl of Warwick and then Duke of Northumberland in October 1551. Henry's mother served as a lady-in-waiting to Anne Boleyn, and later to Anne of Cleves. She was interested in the Reformed religion and, with her family, moved in evangelical circles from the mid-1530s. All Dudley's children grew up in a Protestant household and enjoyed a humanist education. Henry Dudley and his brothers were trained by, among others, the mathematician John Dee. In January 1553 the King became ill and by the beginning of June his condition was hopeless. For more than a year, the Imperial ambassador Jehan de Scheyfye had been convinced of Northumberland being engaged in some \\"mighty plot\\" to settle the Crown on his own head. Always looking out for signs as to this respect, he reported talk that the Duke was contemplating the divorce of his eldest son to marry him to Princess Elizabeth. In fact, it was Henry's youngest brother, Guildford Dudley, who had recently been married on King's favourite cousin Lady Jane Grey. Lady Jane was to ascend the English throne after the King's death, according to Edward's will, headed \\"My Devise for the Succession\\", in which he bypassed his half-sisters Mary and Elizabeth. In 21 June hundred and two personages signed the letters patent, which were supposed to settle the Crown on Jane. King Edward VI died on 6 July. On 10 July Jane and Guildford made their ceremonial entry into the Tower of London. The same day as Jane's proclamation, a letter from Mary Tudor arrived in London, saying that she was now queen and demanding the obedience of the Council. Henry Dudley was imprisoned in the Tower of London with his father and his four brothers. All were attainted and condemned to death, but only the Duke and Guildford Dudley were executed. On the whole, the brothers' release was brought about by their mother and their brother-in-law Henry Sidney, who successfully lobbied the Spanish nobles around England's new co-ruler and king consort, Philip of Spain. Out of prison Henry, Ambrose and Robert Dudley took part in one of several tournaments held by Philip to celebrate Anglo-Spanish friendship. Also in January 1555, Dudley's mother died, leaving Henry some money, which Queen Mary allowed him to inherit despite his attainder. However, the Dudley brothers were only welcome at court as long as King Philip was there; later in 1555 they were even ordered out of London and the next year, in the wake of a conspiracy by their distant cousin Henry Sutton Dudley, the French ambassador Antoine de Noailles reported that the government was seeking to apprehend \\"the children of the Duke of Northumberland\\", who were said to be on the run. By January 1557, the brothers were raising personal contingents to fight for Philip II, now also King of Spain. Henry with his brothers joined the Spanish forces in France and took part in the Battle of St. Quentin, where Henry Dudley was killed. He was married before 1557 to Margaret Audley, daughter of Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden ,and his wife Lady Elizabeth Grey. They were childless, and Margaret later became the second wife of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk.

It premiered on HBO on July 8, 2017. Plot On the first day of the 1982 Tour de France, Italian cyclist JuJu Peppi (Orlando Bloom) accidentally causes a pileup after attempting to grope a bikini clad female spectator, which causes a massive brawl to break out between all the other cyclists, postponing the race until further notice. Police find evidence of narcotics being used by the cyclists and it is revealed that UCI president Ditmer Klerken (Kevin Bacon) accepted bribes of $50,000 each from a majority of the competitors to forego preliminary drug testing. Although all the cyclists are suspected of doping, the UCI allows the Tour to continue with the five competitors who didn't pay off Klerken: Peppi, American-born Nigerian cyclist Marty Hass (Andy Samberg), who is resented by Nigeria for being the one to represent the country, French cyclist Adrian Baton (Freddie Highmore), who is secretly a woman named Adrianna Baton disguised as a man so she can compete, African-American cyclist Slim Robinson (Daveed Diggs), nephew of Jackie Robinson who wants to break the color barrier in cycling like Jackie did in baseball, and Austrian cyclist Gustav Ditters (John Cena), who had gained a considerable amount of muscle mass from the previous year due to steroids. Before resuming the race, the five agree to take turns at the front so everyone else can draft to conserve their energy before the finish line. However, when the race resumes, no one is willing to ride up front, so the cyclists attempt to go as slowly as possible to conserve their energy. This allows Robinson to enjoy the scenery and he eventually leaves the race with a female spectator to become the first black French dairy farmer. Before the end of the day, Ditters is taunted by a spectator for being unable to go fast. When the race resumes ten days later, an enraged Ditters goes as fast as possible to win the day, much to the shock of observers. Believing he had used enhancements, police raid his apartment and find that he had been doping himself with cheetah's blood, which gets Ditters disqualified. When the race resumes, Peppi dies when he overexerts himself, causing his heart to explode within his chest, and falls off a cliff. Hass and Baton are the only competitors left, but they end up becoming attracted to each other and pause the race to go have sex in the woods. Hass finds out Baton's true identity and agrees to keep it a secret, which inadvertently turns him into a gay sports icon. When they resume the race, they tie their bicycles together to make sure they both win simultaneously. On the final day of the race, BBC reporter Rex Honeycut (James Marsden), who had ridden alongside the competitors for real time interviews during the race, is told that because he had ridden all laps of the race and registered to ride on the Tour, he is eligible to win the Tour de France and makes an attempt to do so. Baton detaches from Hass and jumps at Honeycut, knocking him to the ground so Hass can win the race. Honeycut is shown to have motorized his bicycle to keep up with the cyclists. Baton's true identity is exposed and is sent to 35 years in prison for manslaughter as Honeycut had been accidentally killed during the scuffle. Hass looks set to win the Tour de France until Robinson, who had missed the thrill of cycling, rushes out to the front and wins the race by 73 feet. Robinson relishes being the first African-American to excel at cycling like his uncle did at baseball, while Hass laments that Baton's sacrifice was in vain. Present day interviews are conducted with Hass (Jeff Goldblum), Baton (Julia Ormond), Robinson (Danny Glover), and Ditters (Dolph Lundgren), along with other outside observers including disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong who insists on remaining anonymous.

In researching, the team found \\"so much strange behavior surrounding the sport,\\" telling Vulture that \\"...we felt like it was a funny thing to really exaggerate and blow up for comedic purposes.\\" Although much of the cast consists of fans of the sport this was not a prerequisite. Lance Armstrong's role was written in the knowledge that he might not want to be involved, but after being contacted by Samberg, the cyclist agreed to take part. The film's race scenes were shot over the course of four days, and the interviews filmed over a longer period, to accommodate the stars' schedules. To maintain an 80's aesthetic, much of the race footage was shot on Betamax cameras, with \\"sideline footage\\" shot on VHS. Reception Tour de Pharmacy received generally positive reviews, but some criticized Lance Armstrong's appearance. On the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, Tour de Pharmacy holds an 88% approval rating based on 17 reviews with an average rating of 7.5/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 71 out of 100 based on reviews from 13 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". The Atlantics Sophie Gilbert commented, \\"it takes the thorny subject of doping in professional cycling and turns it into pure, gleeful mayhem\\", later calling the mockumentary \\"insane, filthy, and totally fun\\". Uproxxs Alan Sepinwall praised the film for its silliness, calling it the \\"funniest 40 minutes of TV you‚Äôll see this week\\".

His date of birth is placed between 1600 and 1620 and his time of death some time between 1662 and 1682. He is believed to have trained in Rome around 1630. He was likely responsible for a pair of paintings signed and dated 'J. van Dalen fec. in Roma 1631' (Woman holding an Egg and Boy holding a Glass), which were previously in the Liechtenstein Collection in Vienna. He must then have returned to Antwerp where he was registered in 1632-1633 as a pupil of Daniel Middeleer (also called Daniel Middeler and Dani√´l de Middelaer).Dani√´l de Middelaer at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Middeleer was a painter, printmaker and publisher whose other well-known pupils included Cornelis de Bryer and Frans Geffels.Giulio Girondi, Frans Geffels, Rubens and the Palazzi di Genova, pp. 183-199 The artist is believed to have remained active in Antwerp where he is mentioned for the last time in 1669‚Äì1670. Work Allegory of the Four Elements Only very few autograph works by Jan van Dalen are known. One is an Allegory of the Four Elements (Christie's sale 20‚Äì21 November 2013, Amsterdam, lot 128), which is fully signed and dated 1653. A Tambourine player of the same date and signed with initials is in the Michaelis Collection in Cape Town. A half-length figure of a Bacchus in the Kunsthistorisches Museum is also signed with initials and dated 1648. Van Dalen's style reflects influences of artists of the early Roman Baroque. His Allegory of the Four Elements is a typical nocturnal scene in the tradition of Roman and Dutch Caravaggism. The dramatic lighting and figural recall nocturnal scenes of the artist Alessandro Turchi active in Rome. The influence of Caravaggio and the first generation of his followers is more evident in his earlier works. He was exposed to these influences during his time in Rome around 1630. After his return to Antwerp he likely came under the influence of Flemish artists. As a result, his later works show a blending of Italian and northern styles. Van Dalen painted a number of portraits of Bacchus, the ancient god of fertility and wine. In the version in the Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest) the artist possibly portrayed himself as the laughing Bacchus.Jan van Dalen, Laughing Bacchus (Self Portrait?) in the Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest) In the version in the Kunsthistorisches Museum Jan van Dalen gave the deity a mischievous and challenging expression which appears to invite the viewer to enjoy a glass of wine with him.

It is often split into two parts ‚Äì pre- trade and post-trade. Recent regulations, such as the European Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, have required institutions to achieve best execution.  Pre-trade  Pre-trade analysis is the process of taking known parameters of a planned trade and determining an execution strategy that will minimize the cost of transacting for a given level of acceptable risk. It is not possible to reduce both projected risk and cost past a certain efficient frontier, since reducing risk tolerance requires limiting market exposure and thus trading faster. In this situation, market impact cost is much greater than for trades that accept greater risk and are executed more slowly.Almgren, R. and N. Chriss (2000). Optimal execution of portfolio transactions. J.

Risk, 3 (Winter 2000/2001) pp.5‚Äì39 Robert Almgren and Tianhui Li subsequently expanded this to a paper on \\"Option Hedging with Smooth Market Impact\\" , extending the original analysis to derivative markets.  Post-trade  The post-trade process involves first recording the data from previous trading periods, including trade timing, arrival price, average execution price, and relevant details about market movement. These data are then measured and compared to several benchmarks, such as the volume-weighted average price (VWAP), time-weighted average price (TWAP), participation- weighted average price (PWP), or a variety of other measures. Implementation shortfall is a commonly targeted benchmark, which is the sum of all explicit and implicit costs. Sometimes, an opportunity cost of not transacting is factored in. After measurement, costs must be attributed to their underlying causes. Finally, this analysis is used to evaluate performance and monitor future transactions. = Record = Transaction cost analysis aims to improve trading at the level of individual decisions. This requires accurately recording the timing and content for every event in an order's life cycle. Financial Information eXchange (FIX) messages usually provide a consistent and highly accurate source of information for interactions between traders and brokers. Data drawn from an order management system (OMS) or execution management system (EMS), however, are not as granular or as uniform as data from FIX, potentially leading to flawed conclusions unless significant effort is made to address this concern. All gaps must be filled in by supplementing FIX or OMS/EMS messages by communicating with brokers, traders, and portfolio managers. = Measure = A variety of measures and benchmarks are used in transaction cost analysis. The multitude of definitions for best execution and the dangers inherent in placing too much emphasis on a single statistic necessitate the ability to compare agents to a diverse set of benchmarks. These comparisons allow costs to be split into several categories, including explicit cost, implicit cost, delay cost, and opportunity cost. The accurate measurement of each of these costs is necessary to facilitate decision management. For example, if the combination of explicit and implicit costs, which represent the realized cost of transacting, is greater than the opportunity cost of not transacting, it suggests that trades may have been executed too quickly. If the reverse is true, it suggests the need to execute more quickly.Perold, Andr√©. \\"The Implementation Shortfall: Paper vs. Reality.\\" Journal of Portfolio Management 14, no. 3 (spring 1988): 4‚Äì9. = Attribute = Reliable measurements allow decisions to be matched with observed outcomes. In the attribution phase, the four cost categories are broken down further, turning previously confusing statistics into intuitive measures representing specific aspects of a trade. For example, application of a transaction cost model helps split Implementation Shortfall into the parts resulting from the size of the order, volatility, or paying to cover the spread. Proper attribution must also distinguish the influence of market factors (i.e. Sector, Region, Market capitalization, and Momentum) from that of human skill. It is at this stage that problems that can arise if data is not supplemented with communication become clearly evident. For example, an incorrect determination of the time a trader gained control of an order could result in an unfair impact on the performance reported for that trader, when in reality the problem may have resulted from a delay between the portfolio manager and the desk. = Evaluate and monitor = The final stage of transaction cost analysis involves combining the results of the measurement and attribution to evaluate each agent. This is often done through periodic reports detailing important statistics as well as graphics to help visualize trends in the data. Transaction cost analysis providers will often include regular consulting to help draw conclusions from the data, establish goals to improve performance, and monitor future trading to determine the impact of any changes.

The name may have originated when one of the Jumli Malla kings in medieval times made his younger brother, Dharma Malla, chief of staff in the army. This granted Dharma Malla the title of MAHAT (meaning The Great Onehttp://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and- press-releases/mahat), and as a result, his descendants started using 'Mahat' as their surnames. Like other Khasa chetris such as Thapa, Basnyat/Basnet, Karki, Khadka and Rawat, Mahats worship Masta, a local non-vedic deity of the Karnali region. Among twelve Mastas, Khaapar Masta is their Kuldevata. Khasa Chhetris are referred to by their place of origin, and therefore Mahats are also called as Kalikote Mahat. Military roles Mahats have been an integral part of the Nepalese Army during the same period of Shah kings. Many individuals with the Mahat surname still serve the Nepalese Army as well as in the Indian and US armies in different designations, both as officers and non- officers. Population and distribution At the time of the 1991 Nepal census, there were 4,240 Mahats living in 799 dwellings. The most prominent population of Mahat is Mahat Gaun in Jumla.

The beginning of the video shows the surroundings, its steep slopes and difficult access. Description Main entrance The collective granary known as \\"cenobio de Valer√≥n\\" is a complex system of caves on several levels: 298 compartments with surfaces between one and three square meters, distributed on 8 levels. Altogether with silos, rooms, caves and cavities, there are more than 350 storage places. They were excavated with stone and wood tools in the soft tuff - cemented volcanic tephra - in the north-west face of the mountain known nowadays as Mountain of the Galician (\\"Monta√±a del Gallego\\"). The easy defence of the site, the natural shelter offered by a natural arch in the mountain and the conditions of temperature and dampness were making it ideal for its use. The caves or silos are of varied forms and sizes, communicating somewhat with each other, and they are grouped on several superposed levels. The steps excavated in the rock still exist and they may have been complemented with stairs or scaffoldings and ropes, of which there are no archaeological remains. The caves were shut with doors made of unknown material, which left traces. These are believed to have been made of wood, stone slabs or soft materials like textile or leather. A few stone slabs have remainedCenobio de Valeron, section \\"El yacimiento arqueologico\\". On arqueologiacanaria.com. and it seems that when wooden doors were used they received a seal (pintadera) to indicate the owner.Cenobio de Valer√≥n on showcaves.com. Their holes, as well as other grooves, were sealed in addition by an ashen mortar. All this aimed at preserving the crops. Within the site are found idols, paintings, ceramics, human bones and ashes, which are believed to have belonged to those who were guarding the granary. Accounts dating from the Spanish conquest mention towers framing the caves.Cenobio de Valeron on archive.archaeology.org. The sheer size of the caves complex is witness to the importance of agriculture on Gran Canary, for subsistence but also for the society's socio-political structure; and of the power of its governing casts. Alone on that among the Canary islands that all favoured stock-breeding, Gran Canary's agriculture was dominated by plantations, with much of these being grains. Origin of the name The name of \\"monastery\\" comes from the Roman belief that herein had lived some celibate priestesses called \\"harimaguadas\\", with whom young women of noble class came to live until their marriage (this society was matrilineal). The above-mentioned vision prevailed up to the 20th century, when Guy Marcy, a French archaeologist, was the first to recognize its real use as being obviously similar to that of other structures of the island and of north Africa.Cenobio de Valer√≥n, Guia, Gran Canaria, Canary Islands.

In addition, some of the chronicles mention the practice of preserving the food in crags of difficult access. The North African granaries or agadirs often have a common storage area, guarded by the community to which it belongs, with chambers used and maintained by individuals.

It was, in turn, substantially restructured in 1939. This early Fascist-era legislature was a continuation of the bicameral parliament that had existed prior to 1928, though the character, structure and responsibilities of each house (the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies) were altered to various degrees. Chamber of Deputies =History= After passage of the Acerbo Law, and the subsequent consolidation of a two-thirds parliamentary majority by the National Fascist Party, constitutional reforms were implemented reorganizing the Chamber of Deputies. The Law on Political Representation, enacted on May 17, 1928, fundamentally altered composition of the body. Under the new method of election members would not technically be considered \\"deputies\\" as they were not delegates from distinct geographic constituencies or political parties but were instead, theoretically, representatives of the whole of the nation. Benito Mussolini acknowledged this as much by remarking that \\"even the label Chamber of Deputies has become something of an anachronism. It is an institution we inherited from the past and that is foreign to our mentality and to our fascist passions\\". Costanzo Ciano served as president of the Chamber of Deputies from 1934 to 1939. On December 14, 1938, the Chamber of Deputies enacted a further constitutional reform abolishing itself in favor of a new body, the Chamber of Fasces and Corporations. \\"In a typically enthusiastic manner, the deputies emphasized their self-denying fervor by acclaiming also a bill drafting them for front- line service in time of war [regardless of age or physical condition]\\", wrote one observer. It was given royal assent and the new chamber convened the following spring. =Election= The post-1928 Chamber of Deputies was composed of 400 members. Syndicates composed of employers confederations, employees confederations (a form of trade union), and associations of citizens involved in the \\"liberal professions and arts\\" (generally including those employed as educators, artists, artisans, lawyers, accountants, and similar), were responsible for nominating a total of 800 candidates. To this list were added a further 200 candidates nominated by \\"public bodies\\" which included the Italian Olympic Committee, the Dante Alighieri Society, the Touring Club Italiano, the Royal Academy of Italy, veterans' groups, and others. From the resulting list of 1,000 candidates, the Grand Council of Fascism would select 400 who would, thereafter, be formally appointed by the King of Italy. The 400 candidates appointed by the King to the chamber would, before convening, be subject to a popular confidence test through a national referendum; a majority of votes against the new chamber would prompt its dissolution and a competitive public election for the body by geographic constituencies would be held. However, during the period of its existence under the 1928 statute, neither of the two proposed chambers were rejected in the referendums held for their approval (in 1929 and 1934). The term of the chamber was five years. Qualifications for voters were Italian citizenship and attainment of the age of 18 years (lowering the voting age to 18 was one of the original political demands of the Fasci di Combattimento). =Profile= As of 1934, a plurality of deputies were lawyers by profession (99 of the 400 members of the chamber), with engineers, journalists, and university professors representing the second, third, and fourth largest vocational backgrounds among deputies, respectively. Senate The role and composition of the Senate was essentially unchanged after the Fascist revolution. Senators were appointed for life by the King on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, though a small number of persons (adult princes of the royal family, for instance), were automatically members of the Senate. The Senate had no limit on its size and, as of 1935, it had 455 members. The Senate sat in the Palazzo Madama, pictured here in 2011. Luigi Federzoni served as president of the Senate from 1929 to 1939. By custom, however, the Senate had rarely exercised its powers and it functioned primarily as an honorary body to which elder statesmen, retired senior civil servants and diplomats, military leaders, and other prominent persons would be appointed. Nonetheless, the Senate endured throughout the Fascist period as its \\"abolition would have meant an unacceptable encroachment on the King's prerogative\\". Julius Evola subsequently criticized the lack of any substantial reform in the Senate by decrying it as an \\"inefficient, decorative superstructure\\" that \\"remained without a real function\\". After Mussolini's appointment as prime minister of Italy, most new nominees to the Senate were members of the National Fascist Party (PNF). By the early 1930s, a majority of senators were PNF members, though several dozen non-Fascist and anti-Fascist senators continued to hold office. Lawmaking Under the Italian constitution, parliament was composed of the King and both houses, with any of the three authorized to initiate legislation which was then enacted upon approval of the other two. However, in addition, the King was able to, on the advice of the Prime Minister, issue decrees which had force of law unless repealed by parliament. Though this prerogative had typically been reserved for emergencies, after the Fascist revolution it became the customary method by which new legislation was passed.

The game's development was funded partially through a Kickstarter campaign. Cosmic Star Heroine was released in April 2017 for the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows platforms; it was later ported to the PlayStation Vita and Nintendo Switch in 2018. Gameplay Cosmic Star Heroine is a role- playing game where the player recruits up to 11 playable characters, and chooses a party of four to go into combat with enemies. There are no random battles; combat takes place on the field like in Chrono Trigger, with visible enemies and bosses. These encounters do not respawn, but if a player desires to \\"grind\\" for more levels and money, they can start additional battles at any time with as a VR battle, somewhat similar to the ability in Cthulhu Saves the World to force an encounter. Rather than using traditional MP, a unique charge-based system is used. In battle, each character sets up to 7 abilities and a rest/defend type ability; in general, once an ability is used, it cannot be used again until the defend ability is used, which recharges all spent abilities. Additionally, each character has a specific pattern for gaining \\"Hyper\\" turns wherein their abilities are drastically more effective. This makes it so that \\"spamming\\" the most powerful ability is less effective due to needing to spend a turn resting to recharge it; the gameplay is based around setting up buffs and debuffs, then using powerful abilities on Hyper turns. Status effects also operate on a \\"reliable\\" basis, rather than having a percentage chance of success, but enemies also increase status ailment resistance after being inflicted with an ailment. Characters, both PCs and enemies, have a Style gauge that starts at 100% and increases with most actions. Style acts as a multiplier increasing damage done. Style can be lost via near-death and death, as well as certain powerful \\"Burst\\" moves that reset Style to 100%. This acts similar to mechanics in earlier games made by Zeboyd that increase the tension and damage dealt the longer a fight persists. The game has four difficulty settings which can freely be changed between in-game; enemies are tougher and deal more damage on the higher difficult settings. The party can explore 3 planets, which contain both towns and dangerous combat- focused areas. Araenu has a cyberpunk theme, with megacorporations, slums, clubs, and secret bases; Rhomu has a wild-west theme, with saloons, casinos, gunslinging, all underground after war devastated the surface; and Nuluup is a green and verdant planet with mysterious astral powers and a large population of reanimated souls of the dead. There is a base upgrading system similar to the one from the Suikoden series, in which NPCs can be recruited to join the starship flagship of Alyssa's force. Some of these NPCs can also offer bonuses and indirect support to the player's party in battle. There are a variety of sidequests as well, optional content the party can pursue for additional plot scenes and equipment.  Plot  The adventure follows Alyssa L'Salle, an agent of the Agency of Peace & Intelligence (API). An API mission to an abandoned research lab on Rhomu comes into contact with a mission from the rival terrorist organization Astrea; the team investigates and finds the incomplete remnants of a \\"Project Lumina\\" research project guarded by berserk beasts. Alyssa's allies discover that Project Lumina seems to be the foundation for a mind control device. Director Steele, the head of the API, plans on using Lumina to impose order across the galaxy. Alyssa and her friends defect from the API and seek out the aid of Astrea and its leader, Arete. Steele's faction of the API attempts to perfect Lumina, while Alyssa and Astrea attempt to gain allies and build a counter-device to protect against Lumina's influence. Alyssa steals the API's flagship and makes it her own mobile base to investigate a spate of recent incidents: dark energy monsters roaming loose, kidnappings, and mysterious attacks. Eventually, Alyssa's force defeats Steele, himself driven mad by Lumina's dark influence. The victory is short-lived; Arete is revealed to also have been under the influence of Lumina's true master the whole time, having subtly influenced her followers to join Astrea, and she combines her own essence of the Lumina with the device recovered from Rhomu to resurrect an ancient evil god. Alyssa and her party defeat both Arete and the awoken dark god at its alien starship before they can overwhelm the galaxy. Development and release Zeboyd Games officially announced their new upcoming title as Cosmic Star Heroine in June 2013. The game was part funded through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign, raising $132,689 towards its development in October 2013. Zeboyd credited the crowdfunding success to the timing of the campaign and the careful selection of the backer rewards. The game was inspired by titles such as Chrono Trigger, Phantasy Star IV, Final Fantasy VII, and Mass Effect among others.Cosmic Star Heroine Is Like A Cross Between Phantasy Star And Chrono Trigger The game was featured at PlayStation Experience 2015, where the PlayStation Vita version was also playable for the first time. Cosmic Star Heroine was released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 on April 11, 2017. The game was largely released via digital distribution, such as PlayStation Network (PSN) and Steam. Limited Run Games made a physical edition of the game for the PlayStation 4 and the PlayStation Vita. In response to bug reports on the initial launch version and in preparation for the Vita version, several patches were released for the PC & PS4 versions. The PlayStation Vita port was released in May 2018,Cosmic Star Heroine is finally coming to Vita soon, and if you own a PS4 copy you get it for free and a Nintendo Switch port was released in August 2018. Reception Cosmic Star Heroine received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic, while on Gamerankings it has 77%. Critics praised the combat system, retro graphics, and the soundtrack. However, they found the story rushed, the characters underdeveloped, and the game still containing various unfixed technical issues at launch. The game was nominated for \\"Game, Original Role Playing\\" at the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards.

Built in 1902 by Maxwell Evarts, it is a large and elaborate example of Colonial Revival architecture. Evarts was a prominent New York lawyer, who played host to two presidents of the United States here. The property has seen a variety of commercial uses since the death of Evarts' son in 1936. In 2016, it reopened as the Windsor Mansion Inn with new owners. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history Juniper Hill Farm stands atop the crest of a hill northwest of Windsor's main village and is accessed via a winding drive on the north side of Juniper Hill Road. The main house is a large U-shaped 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, oriented with the open end of the U to the north, facing terraced landscaping. The central portion of the U is covered by a dormered hip roof, while the wings are only two stories in height, also covered by hip roofs. The original main entrance is at the center of the southern facade, sheltered by a small gabled portico; it has flanking sidelight windows and a semi-oval transom window. A portion of an open colonnade of fluted Doric columns (once extending across the entire facade and covered by an arbor trellis, all since removed) projects in front of the entrance. The interior retains many original features, including elegant woodwork, a butler's pantry with original cabinets, and a library with panelled walls and fine oak shelving. with Maxwell Evarts was the son of William M. Evarts, a prominent lawyer notable for (among other accomplishments) his role in the impeachment of Andrew Johnson. The younger Evarts followed his father into the profession, also moving in high political circles due to his involvement with the Union Pacific Railroad. The Evarts family was also closely associated with sculptor Augustus St. Gaudens, whose summer studio (now a National Historic Site) was just across the Connecticut River in Cornish, New Hampshire. This house was built (apparently to designs by Maxwell Evarts) in 1902, on land that had been accumulated by the elder Evarts. Evarts made the estate his home until his death in 1913, playing host to Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson in that time. The property remained in the Evarts family until 1944, when it was sold by the ex-wife of Maxwell Evarts' son.

It is now being restored for a range of office and hospitality tenants. Location Clarendon Hotel, Public Trust Building, with the Scott Statue on the right The Public Trust Building is located at 152‚Äì156 Oxford Terrace in the Christchurch Central City. The building overlooks the Avon River. Its immediate neighbour to the north was the Clarendon Hotel, which later became the Clarendon Tower. Background The Public Trust of New Zealand was a government-appointed trustee service for those unwilling to use private services, or required by the courts or legislation to use the Public Trustee. It dealt, for example, with intestate estates, i.e. where people died owning property whose value is greater than the sum of their enforceable debts and funeral expenses without having made a valid will. The Public Trust commenced operating in 1873. The Christchurch office is responsible for a large area, from the Clarence River in the north, the Southern Alps in the west, and the Rangitata River in the south. History The Public Trust has had a number of offices in Christchurch throughout its history, with rapid growth necessitating frequent moves. The first public trustee in Christchurch was Alexander Lean, who had his office at the Chief Post Office in Cathedral Square. The office moved to two further buildings in Cathedral Square before a freehold property was purchased at 96 Gloucester Street; this was the department's home from 1909. When those premises had become too small despite several additions to the building, a new site had to be found. Cecil Wood was engaged to design the building. Wood had been practising as an architect in Christchurch since 1906, and had early in his career become a leading domestic architect. Since 1916, he had been the architect for Christ's College. The Public Trust Building in Christchurch was one of his first large commercial projects. Before the staff moved in, the public enjoyed two open days on 7 and 8 May 1925. On Saturday, 9 May, the Gloucester Street office closed and on Monday, 11 May 1925, the new Public Trust Building opened to the public for business. Wood received further commissions from the Public Trustee and designed their office in Dunedin, which opened on 20 May 1929. =Heritage registration= The New Zealand Historic Places Trust, since renamed to Heritage New Zealand, registered the building as a Category II structure on 26 November 1981, with registration number 3128. The building had a separate heritage registration under the Christchurch City Plan. The current owner, Tailorspace, applied to an independent hearings panel set up for the Christchurch Replacement District Plan to have the local heritage listing revoked, and this request was granted on 12 July 2016.
