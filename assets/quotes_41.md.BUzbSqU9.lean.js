O'Shaughnessy started his career with the opening of a creamery in Newmarket in 1895. He then added other creameries in County Cork and County Tipperary to build the Newmarket Dairy Company which eventually had twenty four branches. In 1903 he purchased Dripsey Woollen Mills from Charles Olden. In the following years he added Kilkenny Woolen mills, Sallybrook Woollen Mills, Bridgetown Flour mills and Dock Milling Company, Dublin to his ownership, thus establishing himself as one of the leading woollen manufacturers in Ireland. His publishing interests included a stake in Standard Press Ltd and Juverna Press Ltd, Dublin. During this time he also built about 70 cottages for the mill workers in what is now known as the Model Village in Dripsey. Newspaper reports from the time comment on the quality of Dripsey tweed and drapery of which 90 per cent was for export to Paris, London, Asia and Canada. After his death in 1956, Dripsey Woollen Mills remained in the family and went on to win 8 Gold Medals at the Sacramento fair in the 1960s. The mills eventually closed in the 1980s. He was elected to D√°il √âireann as a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Cork Borough constituency at the 1923 general election. In June 1924 the Minister for External Affairs, Desmond FitzGerald, appointed O'Shaughnessy as representative from Ireland at the International Labour Conference at Geneva. His party label, \\"Cork Progressive Association\\", was a name used by the Business and Professional Group, a loose association of businessmen formed during the Third D√°il. He did not contest the June 1927 general election. O'Shaughnessy restored a number of residences of character in Cork, and over his life lived in over sixteen different properties. Among the residences he lived in were St Raphael's house, Montenotte; Windsor in Rochestown (now Rochestown Park Hotel) and Dripsey castle (formerly the home of the Bowen-Colthurst family, and sold by members of the O'Shaughnessy family in 2015).

He was ordained on 23 July 1899Historical Dictionary of Gabon , Gardiner and Yates, 2006, accessed 11 August 2008 and his first assignment was at Notre-Dame-des-Trois-√âpis in Ngouni√© in southern Gabon. He was the first person from Gabon to be ordained as a Catholic priest. He served at several locations in Gabon where he learnt a number of local languages and created dictionaries and lexicographies. These works are still used today. From about 1930, Monsignor Walker was one of the few missionaries still studying and documenting Gabonese anthropology, as many foreign researchers had returned to their countries of origin. Walker used interviews to gather the oral traditions of his country using his knowledge of about twelve Gabonese languages. He gathered histories of the Gabonese estuary, the N'Gounie River valley and coastal areas. Raponda-Walker retired in 1947 at Libreville.

He made his professional debut in 1944, and reached the top makuuchi division in 1949. He reached the second highest rank of ≈çzeki in 1955, and was a runner-up in two tournaments. He was well known for his extraordinary size ‚Äì at tall he was the tallest modern era ≈çzeki until Akebono in 1992. After his retirement in 1959 he worked as a coach at Tokitsukaze stable and Tatsutagawa stable until his death in 1985. Career ≈åuchiyama came from a fishing family, and helped out on the fishing boats by diving into the water to catch fish. He was not particularly large in elementary school, but increased rapidly in height after that. During the war he was recruited by the Imperial Japanese Navy, assigned to the anti-submarine patrol unit with his father. He joined Futabayama stable (later Tokitsukaze stable) in 1944 and reached the j≈´ry≈ç division in 1947. He was promoted to top makuuchi division in 1949. In his debut tournament at komusubi in May 1951 he was the only man to defeat tournament winner Chiyonoyama, who was promoted to yokozuna after the tournament. ≈åuchiyama defeated him again in May 1952, this time ranked as a maegashira, and earned his first kinboshi or gold star. After finishing as runner-up to Chiyonoyama with a 13‚Äì2 record in March 1955 (Chiyonoyama defeated him in a playoff for the championship) he was promoted to sumo's second highest rank of ≈çzeki. His promotion was helped by the fact that the only ≈çzeki at the time, Mitsuneyama, was struggling with injury and was demoted shortly afterwards. He was chosen ahead of his sekiwake rival Matsunobori, who was also challenging for promotion. He was the first ≈çzeki over 2 metres tall since the so-called kanban or \\"guest ≈çzeki\\" of the Edo period who were only listed on the banzuke to draw crowds to tournaments. He was said to have broken the jinx that wrestlers who are too big do not win promotion. ≈åuchiyama's ≈çzeki career began well, with a memorable bout on the final day of the May 1955 tournament against Tochinishiki which went to a re- match, and an 11‚Äì4 record in the September 1955 tournament won by his stablemate Kagamisato. However he injured his foot in January 1956 and was also hampered by acromegaly and diabetes. He managed to stay at ≈çzeki for only eight tournaments in total, as two consecutive make-koshi or losing scores saw him demoted from the rank after the January 1957 tournament. He was unfortunate in that the tournament in which he was kadoban he had to withdraw shortly before his match on Day 5 due to injuring his knee doing shiko stamps in the training area. He was the only yokozuna or ≈çzeki since 1950 to have won only one sansh≈ç in his career ‚Äì the Outstanding Performance prize in the tournament that led to his promotion. He did not get a Fighting Spirit Prize in March 1953 despite a 12‚Äì3 record as a maegashira. This was because the makuuchi division was a great deal larger in his time and maegashira wrestlers fought largely amongst themselves and did not face yokozuna or ≈çzeki. There was also no sharing of prizes amongst more than one wrestler in those days. ≈åuchiyama fought in the maegashira ranks until his retirement in 1959, getting another kinboshi for defeating Tochinishiki in May 1957 (a rare example of a former ozeki winning a kinboshi). He came back from a knee injury to produce another runner-up performance in the January 1958 tournament. Retirement from sumo He became an elder of the Japan Sumo Association, working as a coach at his old stable. He was initially known as Shikoroyama Oyakata, and then Tatsutayama Oyakata from 1961. He accompanied his old stablemate Kagamisato when he left Tokitsukaze stable in 1971 to found Tatsutagawa stable. He also worked as a judge of tournament bouts, and it was remarked upon that audience members seated directly behind him would miss most of the action. In his later years he also operated a chankonabe restaurant named \\"≈åuchi\\". It was later taken over by his son and has been featured in the TV series Kodoku no Gourmet. He continued to work at Tatsutagawa stable until his death from a brain tumour at the age of 59 in November 1985. The stable was small, and had been unable to produce a sekitori since its founding, but Takamichi eventually did reach juryo in March 1987, 14 months after ≈åuchiyama's death. Fighting style As well as his great height ≈åuchiyama was known for his strong and flexible legs, and his speed. His most common winning kimarite were yori kiri (force out), yori taoshi (force out and down), kotenage (armlock throw) and uwatenage (overarm throw). Pre-modern career record *Through most of the 1940s only two tournaments were held a year, and in 1946 only one was held.

The synagogue was later rebuilt and moved to the present location at Mandvi in 1860. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the area was inhabited by a small but thriving Jewish community. The local appellation of the synagogue, Juni Masjid, lends itself to the nearby Central railway station, Masjid Bunder. Despite a fall in numbers, the synagogue still maintains active services such as a 6AM service. It serves a congregation of about a hundred members daily. The synagogue is also featured on heritage and religious tours of the city. History According to historical accounts, Samuel Divekar and his brother Issac, served in the British East Indian army as officers. During the Anglo-Mysore Wars, they were captured by the Mysore king Tipu Sultan. They were about to be condemned to death, when Tipu Sultan asked what caste they belonged to. The brothers mentioned that they were Bene Israel. Having never heard of the group, Tipu was about to condemn them to death, when his mother intervened, mentioning that she had heard of the name of the 'caste' in the Koran. Tipu, a devout Muslim spared the two brothers and later exchanged them for a prisoner swap with the British. The two brothers returned to the British enclave of Bombay (now renamed to Mumbai) and built the synagogue in thanksgiving. On 2 April 1919, the synagogue convened a public meeting of Bene Israeli on the subject of Zionism. Over 350 community members attended, and many were sympathetic to the cause of setting up of an independent homeland of Palestine though the debate sparked off deep debate on the subject.

It is located on the border with Essex, around 6 miles (10 km) east of Buntingford.The village is one of the three Pelhams, along with the nearby Brent Pelham and Furneux Pelham. Stocking Pelham was described to have had a population of 163 according to the 2001 census, remaining at 163 in the 2011 Census. Stocking Pelham is home to St. Mary's Church (pictured right) practicing Christianity in the Church of England Diocese of St Albans. The aerial view of Stocking Pelham shows that the settlements are sparsely positioned from one another. Close by the village is a major electrical substation of the National Grid.  Population  Stocking Pelham had a population of 163 according to the 2001 census and the total population was also 163 in 2011 according to the 2011 census. This is illustrated in the graph entitled 'The Population of Stocking Pelham from 2001 to 2011' on the bottom right panel of this page, the straight horizontal line shows that the population was the same after ten years. Historically speaking, much of Stoking Pelham was rather heavily dependent on agriculture for income and in some cases this is still apparent, considering the nature of the environment this may explain why there are now many retired citizens residing there.  History  St. Mary's Church has a tiled chancel roof and a nave which date back to around 1360. Either late 14th or early 15th century a narrow isle was added which required a widened nave. The eastern wall and southern wall of the chancel were re-built in brick in the 19th century. In the 1870s the location of Stocking Pelham was described as > \\"a parish in Bishops-Stortford district, Herts; adjacent to Essex, 5¬º miles > N W of Stanstead r. station, and 6 E of Buntingford.\\" The 1881 Occupational Structure of Stoking Pelham is illustrated in a pie chart below. The chart shows that 46% of the residents at the time were employed in the agricultural sector, hence there was a clear reliance on agricultural labour. In fact, Stocking Pelham almost completely dependent on primary sector labour with a small fraction of 5% working in 'Professional Labour'. Although, the 2011 Occupational Structure of Stocking Pelham also depicted in a pie chart below in accordance to Neighbourhood Statistics shows that since the 19th century Stocking Pelham has since broke from its dependence on primary sector labour. In comparison to the 1881 Occupational Structure citizens are no longer heavily dependent on agricultural labour as a means of income and are now harbouring a more diversely skilled workforce, 26% were employed in professional occupations and 19.5% were employed as managers, directors and senior officials. The remaining 54.5% of the workforce were reported to be working within the tertiary and secondary sectors also.

Early life and career Born in Hinckley, Minnesota, to Robert C. Saunders and Nannie Monk Saunders, his family (6 children) moved to Seattle, Washington in 1907 where his father served as US Attorney. John attended Broadway High School, where he excelled as both student and athlete. Saunders, a member of Sigma Chi Fraternity, received his education at University of Washington in Seattle where he was president of his freshman class and quarterback on the freshman football team. After the UW, he was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, entering in the fall of 1919 where he was the first American to attend Magdalen College. Saunders was a member of their championship swimming team and played on the Rugby squad. He completed his 3-year degree there in just 1 years. While at Oxford, he formed friendships with John Masefield and Rudyard Kipling. After graduation, he served as attach√© at the American Relief Association in Vienna, Austria. He served in the Air Service during World War I as a flight instructor in Florida, but was never able to secure a posting to France, a disappointment that frustrated him for the remainder of his life. After the war he spent time in Paris then returned to Oxford, completing his master's degree in 1923. He worked as a journalist in the US, including stints with the Los Angeles Times and New York Tribune. Saunders began selling short stories to magazines such as Cosmopolitan and Liberty magazines and became editor of American magazine. He first sold the movie rights to one of his stories in 1924, and in 1926, Famous Players-Lasky/Paramount purchased the rights to Saunders's unfinished novel about WWI pilots. Wings garnered $39,000 for the writer - the highest sum paid for film rights at that time - as well as the first Academy Award for Best Picture. Screenwriter Saunders' first screen credit was Too Many Kisses (1925), based on his story \\"A Maker of Gestures\\". This was followed by The Shock Punch (1925) based on his play. In 1926 Famous Players- Lasky/Paramount purchased the screen rights to Saunders' unfinished novel about pilots in World War One for a then-record $39,000.

After its closure in 1999, its major brand, Stones Bitter, has continued to be produced by the Molson Coors Brewing Company. William Stones had started brewing in 1847 in Sheffield with Joseph Watts. Following Watts' death in 1854, Stones continued brewing by himself. In 1868, he purchased the lease of the Neepsend Brewery and renamed it the Cannon Brewery. He continued to brew there until his death in 1894. Stones' success saw him die as one of the richest men in Sheffield, although he lived a modest life. The company was taken over by Bass in 1968. In 2000, Bass sold its brewing operations to the Belgian brewer Interbrew who were ordered by the Competition Commission to sell the Stones brand. In 2002, the brand was purchased by the American Coors Brewing Company, who merged to become Molson Coors in 2005. Stones Bitter was brewed at the Cannon Brewery from 1948 and was popular with Sheffield's steel workers. It was originally available across the south of Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, with distribution extended to the rest of the north of England in 1977, and nationwide from 1979, accompanied by a considerable marketing push. Increasing demand saw it also brewed at other Bass breweries from the 1970s onwards. The beer's popularity reached its apex in 1992 when it was the country's highest selling bitter, selling over a million barrels. The beer has been lauded in certain quarters as \\"one of Sheffield's most famous exports\\". After the Cannon's closure production was continued elsewhere. Keg Stones Bitter (3.7 per cent alcohol by volume) is brewed by Molson Coors at their brewery in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, and the canned product at their Burton upon Trent brewery. Stones sponsored the Rugby Football League Championship and its successor the Rugby Super League from 1986 until 1997. A well known series of television advertisements for the brand from 1983 until 1991, starring Tony Barton and Michael Angelis, became the longest running bitter advertisements in the country. Since the withdrawal of the majority of marketing support by Bass in 1997 in favour of the Worthington ale brand, the beer has experienced a marked decline in sales volumes, although it remains among the twenty highest selling ale brands in the United Kingdom. History Origins (1847‚Äì1900) In 1847, Joseph Watts of Dewsbury and William Stones (1827 -1894) of Sheffield began brewing together at the Cannon Brewery in Sheffield's Shalesmoor district near Kelham Island. The name may have come from the nearby foundry that cast gun barrels. In 1852 they acquired their first tied house, the Kelham Tavern. Watts died in May 1854 aged 46, and two years later Stones purchased his share of the business from his former partner's brother. By 1861 the brewery employed 23 men and two boys. In 1868, Stones took over the lease of the Shepherd, Green & Hatfield brewery in the Neepsend district, which had been founded as the Neepsend Brewery in 1838. He renamed it the Cannon Brewery after his original premises. In 1880 Stones built two malthouses in Worksop. Stones died in 1894, and he left the brewery to his cashier, James Haynes, and Richard Wigfull, a corn miller, as tenants in common. William Stones became a limited company in 1895 with ¬£275,000 of capital (¬£ in adjusted for inflation) and had by this time grown to become one of the largest businesses in Sheffield, with a tied estate of 84 pubs primarily in its home city and Chesterfield. Distribution was extended to Huddersfield in 1896. Consolidation (1901‚Äì1966) Stones acquired the fourteen tied houses of Chambers' Brunswick Brewery in Sheffield, after that company entered into liquidation in 1910, for ¬£28,200 in 1911. In 1919, The Crown Inn opposite the Cannon Brewery was purchased and rebuilt to serve as the brewery tap. By 1939 the brewery estate had expanded to include Mansfield and Barnsley.Sheffield Daily Telegraph - Saturday 30 December 1939 In 1954, William Stones partnered with Tennant Brothers to acquire the Sheffield Free Brewery, closing the brewery and dividing the estate between themselves. In the same year, the company purchased Mappin's Brewery of Rotherham, and the brewery was closed down the following year. The takeover added around 100 public houses to their tied estate, to make a total of 300. As a result, Stones had the second largest tied estate in Sheffield after Tennant's. In 1959, William Stones paid ¬£100,000 (¬£ in adjusted for inflation) for Ward & Sons of Swinton, a family-run local bottler of beer and mineral water. The Ward bottling plant was capable of filling and labelling 8,000 bottles an hour, which was more productive than Stones' existing plant. The acquisition allowed Stones to bottle national beers such as Bass and Guinness for itself, rather than relying on contractors. Also in that year a reciprocal deal was reached with Whitbread, whereby William Stones supplied draught bitter to the 33 houses of the former Scarsdale Brewing Company of Chesterfield, in return for stocking Whitbread's Mackeson Stout in their own tied estate. In 1960, the company was awarded the rights to bottle the Norwegian Ringnes lager brand for the region. All bottling had transferred to Swinton by 1961, allowing Stones to close its own bottling plant, giving it room to redevelop its Sheffield site. In 1962, a deal was reached with United Breweries to sell Carling Black Label lager in Stones tied houses in exchange for supplying Stones products to United's Sheffield area public houses. In 1965 the company was valued at ¬£5 million, rising to ¬£7.2 million by 1967 (¬£ in adjusted for inflation) as takeover rumours mounted. In 1966, William Stones launched its first brewery conditioned beer, Stones Imperial. Multinational ownership (1967‚Äì1999) The Cannon Brewery was rebuilt in 1962. By 1967 Bass had built up a 14 per cent stake in the company, and in 1968 they purchased William Stones for ¬£9 million (¬£ in adjusted for inflation)\\"The protectors and the protected.\\" Economist [London, England] 2 December 1967: 991+. The Economist Historical Archive 1843‚Äì2006. Web. 19 August 2011. The friendly takeover was financed by an exchange of stock. The company had a tied estate of 257 public houses and 70 off-licences, located mainly in the south of Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, as well as a substantial free trade business. Bass retained production of the popular Stones Bitter, but largely replaced the remaining 20 per cent of Stones' sales with its own nationally available brands, such as Worthington E, and Stones' cider supplier was switched from H. P. Bulmer to Bass' own Taunton mill. As a Bass subsidiary, William Stones was given a fair amount of autonomy. The takeover also saw the Swinton bottling plant and the brewery's Worksop maltings closed down. In 1970 Bass suggested that the Cannon Brewery might be shut down, but the continuing popularity of Stones Bitter as well as technical and industrial relations problems at the supposed replacement Runcorn plant in Cheshire ensured the brewery's survival. With Bass' national distribution network, Stones Bitter began to be sold across the entire United Kingdom from 1979, and was intended as a mass-produced equivalent to Bass's regional ales.Hawkins, \\"A History of Bass Charrington,\\" p. 211 By 1982 16 per cent of Yorkshire's public houses were tied to Stones. Bass closed the Cannon Brewery in April 1999 with the loss of 57 jobs. Bass blamed the closure on the steep decline in sales of cask conditioned beers (nationally there had been a 14 per cent decline in sales of cask beer over the previous 12 months) which the brewery produced. The brewer realised ¬£1 million in efficiency savings by closing the brewery. The Campaign for Real Ale blamed the brewery's closure on Bass' failure to promote their cask conditioned products. As well as Stones Bitter, the Cannon brewed the small scale Bass Special, Bass Light and Bass Mild brands from the mid-1990s as declining Stones volumes left the brewery with spare capacity. Bass Light and Bass Mild had been sold in the Sheffield area as Stones Mild and Stones Dark Mild respectively. Bass moved production of Stones to its Burton upon Trent and Tadcaster breweries. In 2000, Bass sold its brewing interests, including their breweries and the Stones brand to the Belgian brewer Interbrew. Interbrew contracted the production of cask conditioned Stones to Marston's in Burton. Competition concerns forced Interbrew to sell off certain brands in December 2001, including Stones Bitter, which was bought by the American Coors Brewing Company (later Molson Coors). Molson Coors currently produce keg Stones Bitter at their brewery in Tadcaster, and the canned version at their Burton brewery. The cask product was initially contract brewed at the Highgate Brewery in Walsall, West Midlands, before moving to Everards of Leicester in 2005. The cask product ceased production in June 2012. Stones Bitter has suffered a decline in sales since the closure, and a member of the Bass board of directors that took the decision to close the brewery has admitted that, given the subsequent resurgence in golden ales and local provenance in beer, the decision to close the brewery was the wrong one. Retrospectively, he argues that Bass should have backed Stones over Worthington. William Stones William Stones was born in Sheffield on 29 December 1826. His parents were Eliza and Joseph, both cabinet case makers. By 1870 Stones was living in Sheffield's Lowfield area. Stones purchased a \\"spacious\\" terraced house in 1883, although he had been renting the property for several years prior to this. Stones died aged 68 on 14 November 1894, having devoted his whole life to brewing. He died as one of the richest men in Sheffield, leaving over ¬£150,000 in his will (¬£ in adjusted for inflation). A bachelor, he left his wealth to his sister, friends and various charitable concerns. Stones is said to have earned his success through clever marketing and a consistently good product.Alfred Barnard, The Noted Breweries of Great Britain and Ireland, ASIN: B00088J9BU Cannon Brewery The former office building is in the foreground. Situated in Neepsend, Shepherd, Green & Hatfield were the first to brew at the site in 1838 at what was then a respectable residential district. By 1895 the brewery was equipped with \\"an expensive plant...excellent stores and cellars, spacious covered and open yards, offices, stabling [and] workshops.\\" The marketing and sales offices on the brewery site were completed in 1958. A new ¬£500,000 five-storey brewhouse was operational by 1962, and was one of the most up to date in the country. An on-site public house was opened in the basement of the brewery in 1964, initially named The Underground, but later renamed The Pig and Whistle; it was used by brewery workers and visitors. At its peak the brewery produced 50,000 hectolitres of cask conditioned Stones each year. The office building was sold off in 1985. In 1992 a visitor's centre building was opened. In 1995, the brewery was used as a shooting location for the film When Saturday Comes. The office building is occupied by an accountancy firm, however the remainder of the site is currently unoccupied and derelict. Beers Stones Bitter Pump clip for Nice Try, a seasonal special using the Stones brand name. Stones Bitter is a bitter beer first brewed in 1948 at the Cannon Brewery. It was designed for the steelworkers of Sheffield's Lower Don Valley. Bass extended its distribution to include the north of England in 1977, before extending distribution nationwide in 1979. Its popularity during the 1970s and 1980s in its heartland saw it described as \\"more of a religion than a beer.\\" By 1992 Stones was the UK's highest selling bitter, with a million barrels sold annually. That same year the ABV of Stones was reduced from 4.1 per cent to 3.9 per cent ABV, and then to 3.7 per cent in 1999. The cask conditioned Stones was restored to 4.1 per cent ABV in 2006, before being discontinued in 2012. A famous major television campaign ran nationally from 1983 until 1991 with the tagline \\"(Wherever you may wander) there's no taste like Stones\\" and starred Tony Barton and Michael Angelis. By 1987 it had become the UK's longest running bitter campaign of all time. Stones also sponsored the Rugby Football League Championship from 1986 to 1995 and its successor the Rugby Super League from 1996‚Äì7. Other beers As with many breweries, occasional special brews were commissioned upon commemorative dates and retirement of long-serving employees. In 1991 a special bottled beer was produced when Sheffield Wednesday reached the finals of the Football League Cup. Two thousand bottles of Stones Centenary Ale were produced in 1995, celebrating 100 years of rugby league. This was followed by the 1996 cask conditioned Stones Super League Bitter (4.8 per cent ABV) celebrating Stones' sponsorship of the League, and the 1998 bottled Stones Commemorative Ale which marked the scheduled closure of the brewery. In summer 2007, Everards brewed a one-off cask conditioned Stones Pure Gold (4.1 per cent ABV) golden ale, and in 2011 four cask conditioned sports themed Stones branded ales were made available throughout the first half of the year, brewed at William Worthington's Brewery in Burton upon Trent.

T.568-1996 The Stoke Edith Wall Hanging is an embroidered wall hanging made in 1710-20, depicting elegant people walking in an early 18th-century garden. This is the larger of two such works which originally hung in Stoke Edith in Herefordshire. The Stoke Edith House was built in 1697 for Paul Foley, Speaker of the House of Commons, and finished by his son Thomas, an MP and wealthy landowner. After a visit by the leading garden designer George London in 1692 the park and gardens were remodelled to his suggestion, and it is likely that pleasure grounds would have been laid out around the house in a series of formal compartments with geometric walks, flower-beds and fountains. The house was destroyed by fire in 1927. Prior to this the hangings hung in the green velvet bedroom, between the dado and the ceiling. After the fire they were kept by the Foley family in London. The hanging shows couples strolling, the long shadows suggesting a late afternoon in summer. A gentleman doffs his hat while his lady holds out her closed fan, the lappets of her headdress rippling in the breeze. A spaniel chases a squirrel up a tree, peacocks strut around and swans glide on the lake. Orange trees in Chinese pots and laden fruit trees contribute to the graceful affluence of the scene. Embroidered hangings such as this were used like woven tapestries, lining the walls of a room with decorative, narrative scenes, and bringing the country or garden inside the house. Despite their large scale they manage to convey a sense of intimacy in their celebration of private family pleasures. The hangings are worked mainly in tent stitch in silk and wool on a linen canvas ground, there are some areas of applique with chain stitch. The design was drawn on the canvas prior to embroidery, this can be seen in some areas where the stitches have dropped out. From this evidence it appears that some small areas of the design were not executed, or were worked differently from the original design.

Early life  Hansen was School Captain of The Hills Grammar School in Kenthurst, New South Wales and is a graduate of the University of Sydney with honours in Australian literature and Australian history. In 1996 he appeared as a subject in Simon Target's documentary Uni about three students studying at the University of Sydney (Hansen later satirised Target in CNNNN where he played the network's British correspondent who was also called Simon Target). Soon-to-be fellow Chaser member Charles Firth was one of the other two students featured, with Craig Reucassel also making occasional background appearances. During the documentary it was revealed that Hansen suffered from clinical depression while attending the university.  The Chaser  CNNNN Hansen starred in The Chaser's satirical American news show CNNNN as the leader of the \\"newsband\\". He was also characters Rudi J Blass, director of \\"Newstainment\\", and Simon Target, an English reporter.

He is also known for his character pieces, which include Scenes from the Life of the Crazy Warehouse Guy, The Surprise Spruiker, Clive the Slightly Too-Loud Commuter, and Mr. Ten Questions. In the second part of the first season and the whole of the second and third, Andrew sported a different hairstyle every week. He has said that he likes to look entertaining with his clothes and his hair. Hansen is a pianist and guitarist and in addition to his songwriting, Hansen composed the show's theme music, which received the APRA-AGSC Screen Music Award for Best Television Theme (2006). In The Chaser's War on Everything DVD Volume 2's commentary, Hansen revealed that he is a fan of computer games and Doctor Who. This may have sparked the inspiration for one of his songs sung on The Chaser's War on Everything Season 1, about Doctor Who. It is also stated on the commentary that about 3/4 of the Doctor Who props in the video clip were supplied by Andrew himself. On the Season 2 Volume 1 commentary, it was revealed jokingly that Hansen is a huge fan of U2, which is why he chose not to imitate lead singer Bono during a sketch. This allegation was possibly tongue-in-cheek, as Hansen did make fun of Bono by playing a Bono-like character in his radio show The Blow Parade. For Season 1 of the program, he received the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Performance in Television Comedy (2006). = The Eulogy Song = The most controversial song that Hansen has performed was The Eulogy Song, which was originally written for Chris Taylor's play Dead Caesar, with music by Hansen and lyrics by Taylor.

The song became the target of significant media attention, with several radio and television personalities saying the song was in \\"bad taste\\", and both the then Prime Minister of Australia John Howard and then Leader of the Opposition Kevin Rudd expressing negative views.

Biography  Born in Montivilliers, Marie-Fran√ßoise Bucquet began her studies at the Vienna Music Academy and continued this tradition by further studies with Central European musicians: the eminent pianist Wilhelm Kempff and later another eminent pianist, Alfred Brendel. The influence of Edouard Steuermann and Max Deutsch, who were both pupils of Schoenberg, and Pierre Boulez made her also a specialist in 20th-century music. Composers such as Betsy Jolas, Iannis Xenakis and Sylvano Bussotti wrote works especially for her. Repeated concert tours which Bucquet made as a soloist and with orchestra ranged over much of the world. For the Philips label she recorded works by, among others, Bizet, Bart√≥k, Stockhausen and Stravinsky. In 1976 she was awarded an Edison for one of her Schoenberg recordings. She gave numerous master classes in Italy, Spain, the United States, Japan, and (regularly from 1988) the Netherlands, the last-named being The International Holland Music Sessions. From 1986 till her death, Bucquet was professor of piano at the Conservatoire de Paris where she was appointed Head of the Pedagogical Department and member of the Board in 1991. In 1979 she formed a duo with her husband, baritone Jorge Chamin√©. Their discography includes several award- winning recordings: songs by Brahms (Lyrinx-Harmonia Mundi); songs by Carlos Guastavino (Movieplay Classics); songs by various composers to Hebrew texts (ADDA) and, in 2002, Spanish-language songs by Falla, Joaquin Turina and the Cuban Joaquin Nin. This last release was for, again, Lyrinx-Harmonia Mundi. Along with her husband, Bucquet organised each year an Atelier Musical in Paris, this event having been held in collaboration with the Centre Culturel Calouste Gulbenkian, and having involved special lessons in interpretation and performance. In addition, she served as jury member at many international piano competitions, among them the International Piano Competition in Dublin. She died in August 2018.

It had a particular emphasis on family welfare (expansive tax cuts and a lift in the threshold of the Medicare levy surcharge) and capital investment (national accreditation) funds. Swan described it as \\"a A$55 billion Working Families Support Package\\" that \\"strengthens Australia's economic foundations, and delivers for working families under pressure\\" from increasingly high interest rates. . Retrieved on 2008-08-11. Total spending was cut, following on from gradual cuts of nearly 2% of GDP over the decade of the Howard government. Changes to taxation prompted then Shadow Treasurer Malcolm Turnbull to claim the increased taxation will contribute to inflation, but Swan argued that the tax will affect only high income-earners, dispelling any \\"custodian\\" line of attack. Heavy spending by the states had been inefficient at managing past underinvestment on infrastructure, and \\"the conduct of expansionary monetary policies will be less complicated\\" as a result of the new reform agenda to avoid (supply-side) case-mix funding of the health care and vocational training sectors of the economy. A new $3 billion tax increase on alcopop drinks was designed to slow down a projected increase (from the Federal Health Minister, Nicola Roxon, tabling Treasury advice) in alcopop sales by 43 million bottles, curtailing binge drinking. However, the opposition described the increase as merely a revenue raiser, with Shadow Health Minister Joe Hockey arguing that consumers of alcopop will switch to other drinks, such as champagne, and binge drinking will not decrease. In response, the Prime Minister told Federal Parliament that the tax increase had wide support in medical and alcohol support services. Opposition Leader Brendan Nelson counter-offered with a $1.8 billion petrol tax cut, reversing years of policy opposing lowering petrol taxes. The Opposition pledged to block the alcopop tax in the Senate, which it will control until July 2008, and has also pledged to block a move to remove a surcharge tax trap for people who fail to take out health cover, which, it claims, will drive up insurance premiums and steer people away from private healthcare. An increase to the luxury car tax was defeated in the Senate, with Steve Fielding of Family First joining the coalition in blocking the budget legislation. It had been supported by the government, the Australian Greens, and independent Nick Xenophon.One man blows $555m hole in budget over luxury car tax: SMH 4/9/2008 It was later passed by all non-coalition Senators after amendments were made.Luxury car tax bill passes Senate: The Age 24/9/2008 Reception The World Wildlife Fund of Australia has criticised the ambiguity of the Budget's timeline for developing coal pollution mitigation technology, while the Australian Conservation Foundation has urged the government to reconsider taxes that promote the creation of pollution. However, multinational real estate company Jones Lang LaSalle lauded the $90 million Green Building Fund, which subsidies half the cost of fitting office blocks with environmentally friendly design features. Senior citizens representative group Seniors Australia criticised the budget for not increasing the seniors pension, and Carers Australia expressed dismay over the lack of change for carer payments. A day after the Budget's release, the government promised a future inquiry into carer and pensioner payments and asserted that the pensions will increase after a specialised review.

Esquisse phonologique du Loron. Annales de l‚ÄôUniversit√© d‚ÄôAbidjan, s√©rie H, Linguistique 10: 53-82. who are located in the forested savannah region of northeast C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire and southwest Burkina Faso, came originally from the Bouna region of C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire. There are approximately 10,000 Loron people. Their language, which is called T√©√©n, is 45% cognate with that of the Kulango language in the Bouna area, although their culture reflects that of the Lobi people.  Background  Around 250 years ago, when many Loron people were killed in warfare with other tribal groups from the south of C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, the Loron fled the Bouna region. They moved north along the Mounhoun/Black Volta river, and then west, and settled in the area that is now the town of Gaoua, Burkina Faso, about 100 miles (160 km) from Bouna, C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire. When the Lobi people moved into the Gaoua area from Ghana in the late 18th century, the Loron, like most other smaller ethnic groups in the region, adopted many of the customs of the dominant and more numerous Lobis. Although, to this day, the Loron people are still considered the ‚ÄòOwners of the Land‚Äô in the Gaoua area. To avoid conflict with their neighbouring tribes the relatively timid Loron went in search of new pastures. Most of the Loron people gradually migrated south, to the mountains which form the border between Burkina Faso and C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, just south of the Lobi town of Kampti. Approximately 100 years ago a large group of Loron people moved further south, out of the mountainous region, and settled in a more fertile area in C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire between Doropo and Tehini. This all happened, of course, before country demarcation lines were created by the French colonialists. Location The Lorhon/Loron people are now concentrated mainly in the Sub-Prefecture of Tehini in northeast C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire; and the province of Poni in southwest Burkina Faso. Approximately 70% of the Loron live in C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, and 30% in Burkina Faso. The Loron in C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire are scattered over an area of about , just north of the Como√© National Park. In Burkina they are located mainly in the mountain area between Kampti and the C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire border. Around 5% of the Loron, mostly young Loron males, live and work on the cocoa and coffee plantations of southern C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire. They usually spend 1‚Äì2 years there, before returning to marry and settle down in their natal village. Way of Life The vast majority of Loron people are subsistence farmers, living in small villages of between 50-100 people. Families normally live in homesteads separated from other families by small planting areas. As with the Lobi people, ‚ÄòTwo reaches of an arrow‚Äô represents an appropriate distance between two Loron family homesteads. The Loron in both C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire and Burkina Faso are probably among the least developed people groups in their respective countries. They normally live in isolated areas with little or no access to schools, medical facilities, or potable water. The Loron people are animist in the sense that they believe that the inanimate objects that they create represent the spirit world. They fabricate fetishes, or idols, (punibo) from wood, clay or metal. Appeasing the demands of these ‚Äògods‚Äô dominate every aspect of their lives. They believe Nyelye ‚Äì God/sky created everything, but that ‚Äòit‚Äô has no further interest in people. They believe that a wide range of supernatural beings and invisible spiritual powers control and shape their lives. The Loron people offer sacrifices to their idols to ensure, among other things, an adequate food supply, protection from the spirits which can harm or kill, healthy children and harmony in the community. They have many taboos and rituals which they need to respect throughout their lives in order to avoid sickness, death or misfortune.

It is based on a technique Xenakis invented in early 1970s, called arborescences--proliferations of melodic lines created from a generative contour . The title refers to the name of one of the Gorgon sisters, and is also Greek for open sea. Written in 1973, Evryali was Xenakis' second major work for piano solo after Herma, written in 1961. Evryali was composed for, and dedicated to, pianist Marie-Fran√ßoise Bucquet. According to her, upon presenting her the score, Xenakis said: \\"Here's the piece. Look at it, and if you think you can do something with it, play it\\" (, translated in ). Conventional notation is used throughout the score; however, instead of using two or three staves as is customary for piano scores, Xenakis frequently employs four and five staves. Numerous passages are impossible to play as written either because it is physically impossible to reach the notes, or, in one case (a C-sharp in the penultimate passage of arborescences), because the written note is not available on most pianos (this particular difficulty was rectified in a later edition of the work). Therefore, the performer has to create a reduction of the piece, omitting some notes, transposing others, etc., in order to make it playable (; ). Citing these and other difficulties of Evryali, pianist-composer Marc Couroux compares the performer to the \\"warrior\\" from Carlos Castaneda's books: when confronted with the piece, one must remain \\"lucid\\" and choose \\"which aspects [of the piece] are essential and must be preserved\\", and which must be sacrificed . The music consists almost entirely of a limited number of distinct kinds of texture. On the most basic level, one can distinguish five of these: fixed rhythmic passages, stochastic clouds, polyphonic arborescences, monophonic waves and silence (; . Chung offers different names for the textures, but with essentially the same content). A more complex analysis, offered by musicologist Ronald Squibbs, reveals that Evryali has four distinct \\"configuration types\\". The first is derived from applying set theory to time-point sequences, each of which is then assigned to a specific pitch. This is the configuration type the work starts with. The second type is generated by stochastic methods, arborescences constitute the third, and finally, the fourth configuration type is silence . According to this classification, there are fifty segments overall in Evryali: 23 for time-point sequences, 4 for stochastic material (appearing only at two points in the work, both times as consecutive pairs), 20 for arborescences, and 3 are silences. In the score, the silences are notated in seconds. In adopting a single tempo throughout, Evryali is unique in Xenakis' oeuvre for solo piano . Evryali is connected to earlier works, particularly Synapha√Ø (1969), certain parts of which led to the creation of the arborescence technique . Several passages from Evryali were later reused, with some modification, in the chamber work Dikhthas (1979) .

Where Fate Beckons. ABC Books, Sydney. , p. 191 His mother was Anna Caysergues (1730‚Äì1823). He had a sister Lise de Lesseps (1769‚Äì1840), married in 1788 to Louis Maurice Taupin de Magnitot (1757‚Äì1823), and a brother Mathieu de Lesseps (Hamburg, 4 May 1774 ‚Äì Tunis, 28 December 1832), married to Catherine de Grevign√© (M√°laga, 11 June 1774 ‚Äì Paris, 27 January 1853), the parents of Ferdinand de Lesseps. By age 12 he spoke fluent Russian, German, Spanish and, of course, French. After studying at the Jesuit college of Versailles for five years, he returned to St. Petersburg in 1783. He was appointed Vice-Consul of France in Kronstadt and once had to intervene with the crew of the French ship Uranie of Dunkirk who had largely deserted. Noticed by France's Ambassador to Russia, Mr de S√©gur, he was entrusted to carry important news to Versailles. There he met with Paul Antoine Fleuriot de Langle, second in command of the La P√©rouse expedition, who had the respect of Louis XVI. La P√©rouse asked the Minister of Marine and the Colonies, Charles Eug√®ne Gabriel de La Croix, marquis de Castries to add Lesseps to the expedition as a Russian interpreter as the intended route took them into Russian territory in the north-west Pacific Ocean. His father should have been consulted but there was no time for that, so Castries appointed him to be vice-consul to succeed his father. Instead of returning directly to St. Petersburg, Lesseps would take the much longer route with La P√©rouse to the north-west Pacific and then travel overland.last sentence: Dunmore, John. 2006.

The journey took the ships south across the Atlantic Ocean, around Cape Horn to the Pacific, stopping at Easter Island, Hawaii, modern-day Alaska, Macao, Manila, the Sea of Japan, the Sea of Okhotsk and then to the port of Saints Peter and Saint Paul, now Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky on the eastern side of the Kamchatka Peninsula.Dunmore, John. 2006. Where Fate Beckons. ABC Books, Sydney. , map p. 198 Transcontinental journey Path of Barth√©lemy de Lesseps of the La P√©rouse expedition While in port, La P√©rouse received orders to proceed as quickly as possible to Australia to investigate a rumored British settlement at Botany Bay. Before leaving, however, he needed to get reports of the voyage back to Paris. Since ice would soon close the port for months, the only option that would keep the material under French control was to send it overland with de Lesseps. The ships left on 7 october 1787, and de Lesseps left a week later with Kassloff Ougrenin, the governor of Okhotsk, traveling 160 km across the peninsula to Bolsheretsk, a journey that took two weeks, including the building of a raft to cross the Bolchaiareka River. From there they hoped to sail to Okhotsk; when that wasn't possible, they decided to follow the coast around the top of the Sea of Okhotsk, a distance of 1600 km. The party stayed in Bolsheretsk until the end of January while a convoy of 35 sleighs was assembled, but both the weather and Kassloff's official duties slowed progress. De Lesseps chose to separate from the main group, reaching Yamsk at the end of April. Speeded by a road, he reached Okhotsk on 8 May. Lesseps crossing the Kamchatka Peninsula by dog sled De Lesseps set off promptly for Yakutsk, 1200 km inland, but as the weather warmed and the tracks through the snow turned to mud, the sleighs were bogged down, so he dragged them back to Okhotsk. On his return he was able to buy a few horses which he described as \\"frightful, half-starved beasts\\" before setting off again on 6 June. On 5 July he sailed up the Lena River to Lensk and then Kirensk; at the time both towns consisted of little more than a few log cabins. As it was now mid-summer, the water was no longer freezing, but clouds of midges swarmed near the shore. The boats broke up on the rapids, but de Lesseps was able to continue on horseback to Irkutsk, near the south-western end of Lake Baikal. De Lesseps then used a carriage to travel through Krasnoyarsk, Achinsk, Tomsk, Tobolsk, Tyumen, Yekaterinburg, and Kungur in the Ural Mountains to Kazan, where he was injured in an accident. To avoid being caught for another winter, he pressed on to Nizhniy Novgorod, then (Veliky) Novgorod, reaching St Petersburg, his intended destination, on 22 September 1788, more than a year after he started. However, this was not the end of his journey. After delivering La P√©rouse's reports to the French Ambassador, he learned that he was wanted in Paris, so he continued on through Riga, K√∂nigsberg and Berlin, reaching Paris on 17 October. The new Secretary of State for the Navy, C√©sar Henri, comte de La Luzerne, met him at Versailles, where he met Louis XVI, was greeted as a hero, and was appointed Consul at Kronstadt.All details under \\"Transcontinental journey\\" except last sentence: Dunmore, John. 2006.

In 1794, he was appointed assistant to Pierre Ruffin, secretary of the French legation in Constantinople, who was former French consul in Crimea. Following Napoleon Bonaparte's expedition to Egypt in 1798, there was great discontent against the French, who were subjected to violence. He was imprisoned with his wife and children at the Yedikule Fortress in Constantinople for three years. In August 1801, following the French evacuation of Egypt, they were released. On his return to France, Bonaparte, First Consul, sent him to Saint Petersburg to organize the Consulate General there. At the beginning of 1802, he was responsible for supplying the French navy with timber. But after the battle of Austerlitz, the situation deteriorated. He went to join Talleyrand in Warsaw and from there left for Dresden where he met the emperor. After the Peace of Tilsit, he returned to the consulate of St. Petersburg, but in 1812 relations with Russia were broken again; the whole family had to leave.

He is the younger brother of the Italian footballer Stefano Di Chiara. Club career A Roma youth product, he made his Serie A debut with the club during the 1980‚Äì81 Serie A season, also winning the Coppa Italia that year. After two seasons with the club, he was transferred to Serie B side Reggiana in 1982, making 22 appearances. In 1983, he was acquired by Lecce for the following season. He helped the club achieve an historic first-time promotion to Serie A during the 1984‚Äì85 season, his second year with the club. During the 1985‚Äì86 Serie A season, he played alongside his brother Stefano under manager Eugenio Fascetti. Between 1986 and 1991, he played with Fiorentina, collecting 122 appearances and 10 goals in Serie A over five seasons. Although he was initially acquired as a winger in 1986, the club's new Brazilian manager at the time, Sebasti√£o Lazaroni decided to deploy him as an attacking full-back or wing-back, in the mould of offensive, Brazilian attacking fullbacks, such as Djalma Santos, due to Di Chiara's pace, technical ability, and his offensive style of play. During his time at the club, he reached the 1990 UEFA Cup Final. In 1991, he joined Parma, where he remained until 1996, during one of the club's most successful periods, playing predominantly in his new full- back role under manager Nevio Scala, also achieving his first call-up to the national side. During his time at the club, he formed a notable partnership with fellow attacking full-back Antonio Benarrivo, and he won the 1991‚Äì92 Coppa Italia, the 1992‚Äì93 European Cup Winners' Cup, the 1993 UEFA Super Cup, and the 1994‚Äì95 UEFA Cup, also achieving runners-up medals in the 1992 Supercoppa Italiana, the 1994 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final, and in the 1995 Coppa Italia Final, as well as a third-place finish in Serie A in 1995. After leaving the club in 1996, he ended his career after a season with Perugia, retiring in 1997. International career After representing the Italy under-21 side twice in 1985, Di Chiara also represented the Italian senior national side as a fullback on 7 occasions between 1992 and 1993, while playing for Parma. He was the first ever Parma player to be called up for Italy, making his debut on 31 May 1992, in a 0‚Äì0 home draw against Portugal, under manager Arrigo Sacchi. Style of play Di Chiara was a consistent and offensive-minded left-footed full-back, who was capable of playing anywhere along the left flank; throughout his career, he was also used as a winger, or as a wing-back. His pace, flair, composure, stamina, technical skills, and attacking instincts enabled him to charge down the wing, beat opponents, and create chances for teammates with accurate crosses.

In 2015 he received a United States Artist Fellowship, for contributions to the creative landscape and arts ecosystems of the country. He was a finalist for the 2015 Balvenie Rare Craft Fellowship Award, for contributions to the maintenance and revival of traditional or rare craft techniques. In 2014 he was awarded a Voulkos Fellowship at the Archie Bray Foundation for the Ceramic Arts in Helena, Montana, for outstanding contributions to the ceramic arts. He is known for his functional pottery and especially for his large scale wood- fired, salt-glazed ceramic pots, known as \\"monster pots.\\" His work is influenced by Asian pottery, African pottery, North Carolina pottery, and especially the English pottery of Bernard Leach. Hewitt was taught by Leach's first student, Michael Cardew. Hewitt was born in England in 1955 not far from the Spode china factory in Stoke-on-Trent. His father and grandfather were both managers at Spode, so he grew up with that ceramics tradition. While at Bristol University in 1975, however, Hewitt was attracted to the very different English studio pottery tradition when a friend loaned him a copy of Leach's seminal work, \\"A Potter's Book\\". Thereafter, he sought out opportunities to learn studio pottery, becoming Cardew's apprentice at the Wenford Bridge Pottery in Cornwall. Hewitt's decision ultimately to settle in North Carolina has influenced his work profoundly, as have his travels to Africa and Southeast Asia. The North Carolina influence can be seen, for instance, in his use of alkaline glazes, runs of glass, and use of contrasting colors of clay. At the same time, his English roots may be seen in his close control of the potter's wheel, his crisp lines, and in the North Devon-style handles of many of his pots. Hewitt makes a complete line of functional ceramic pots, and much of his work is intended for everyday use. He also makes large-scale vessels of a more sculptural vein, such as his grave markers. His work can be found in the permanent collection of several American museums. He was also the co-curator, with Nancy Sweezy, of \\"The Potter's Eye: Art and Tradition in North Carolina Pottery,\\" at the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh, North Carolina (October 2005 ‚Äì March 2006). In 2017 he edited the book \\"Great Pots from the Traditions of North & South Carolina\\", published by the North Carolina Pottery Center in Seagrove, North Carolina. He was President of the Board of the North Carolina Pottery Center from 2013 - 2017.

While he spent most of his life in that state, he took a trip to the western frontier in the mid-nineteenth century and executed a series of drawings of Native Americans; he also studied in Paris for five years in the 1860s. Primarily known for his oil paintings and watercolors, he also worked in other media, including pen and crayon drawings, engraving, and illustrating. Many of his work have historic themes. Early life and education Francis (Frank) Blackwell Mayer was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on December 27, 1827, the son of Charles Mayer (1795-1864) and Eliza Blackwell Mayer (1803‚Äì1885). He was one of three sons, Henry Christian Mayer (1821‚Äì1846), the son of his father with his first wife, and Alfred M. Mayer, who became a noted physicist, being the other two. An uncle, Brantz Mayer, was a noted author. Frank Blackwell Mayer studied art in Baltimore with Alfred Jacob Miller and Ernest Fischer in the 1840s and in Paris with Charles Gleyre and Gustave Brion between 1864 and 1869, specializing in oil paintings and crayon drawings. He lived in Paris from 1862 to 1870, where his artwork was exhibited at annual expositions in both London and Paris. Early career Frank Blackwell Mayer in 1851, drawing by Ashton White Frank B. Mayer began his work to form the Maryland Art Association on March 14, 1847 and the association met in his studio once a week. He went on to work as an engraver in Philadelphia in 1847 and in 1848 served as the assistant librarian for the Gallery of Fine Arts at the Maryland Historical Society, which his uncle author Brantz Mayer, was heavily involved with, both in its founding and as president. He also made illustrations for his uncle‚Äôs books on Mexico. Mayer went on to form the Allston Association with friends for the appreciation of American Artists. Its constitution outlined the usual club regulations and allowed ladies as auxiliary members and outlined the plans for art exhibitions and for assistance given to native artists. He also served on the club‚Äôs Board of Directors. In May 1851, Mayer travelled to Minnesota Territory and observed the signing of the Treaty of Traverse Des Sioux. He wrote extensive journals and made pen and ink drawings of his experiences in the west.Mayer (1932), passim. This experience was the influence for one of his most famous paintings, ‚ÄúTreaty of Traverse des Sioux, Minnesota‚Äù from 1886. Upon his return to Maryland, ten of his watercolors were exhibited by the Artist‚Äôs Association of Baltimore at the Maryland Historical Society in 1856. Artistic career After his education in Europe, Mayer received a medal and diploma from the Maryland Institute for his works ‚ÄúContinental‚Äù and ‚ÄúAttic Philosopher.‚Äù Upon his return to the United States, he settled in Annapolis, Maryland, and resided on Market Street while keeping a studio on Prince George Street. His work included historical paintings, two of which were bought by the State of Maryland and hang in the Maryland State House, The Burning of the Peggy Stewart, and the Planting of the First Colony in Maryland. Additional artwork by Mayer such as the well-known Annapolis in 1750 was done for private individuals, the Peabody Institute, and the U.S. government. In 1891, Mayer was commissioned by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to paint The Founders of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, representing the railroad's history from its founding in 1827 to 1880. It was displayed at the B&O;'s headquarters in Baltimore for much of the 20th century. The original painting is now at the headquarters of CSX Transportation in Jacksonville, Florida, the successor railroad to the B&O.; A replica is on public display at the B&O; Railroad Museum in Baltimore.Museum Guide, B&O; Railroad Museum, Baltimore, 2008. Life in Annapolis In 1876, Mayer purchased a home in historic Annapolis and took an active interest in the city‚Äôs improvement. In 1884, Mayer helped found the Local Improvement Association of Annapolis. Mayer was active in landscaping public areas of the city such as the circle around Market Space. He was later a member of the building committee of a new public school and was interested in architecture as well as the history of Annapolis. He conducted research on the \\"customs and characters\\" of Annapolis that later formed the basis for a chapter in Elihu S. Riley's The Ancient City: A History of Annapolis, in Maryland 1649-1887 (Annapolis: Record Printing Office, 1887). Maryland State House The Burning of the Peggy Stewart (1886) Mayer was also involved in improving the Maryland State House grounds in Annapolis. In 1882, he designed a number of changes to the fencing and walkways that were made on the State House grounds. Evidence suggests that Mayer may also have designed the porch for the State House that was contracted in July 1882, since an unsuccessful bid for the construction of the porch submitted by C.C. Woolley refers to Mayer's plan for the work (Notes by Edward C. Papenfuse, Maryland State Archivist). In 1884, he wrote a six-page letter to the Senator from Charles County, Dr. F.W. Lancaster, the chairman of the Committee for Public Buildings. In this letter, he requested permission to submit a report to the Committee regarding potential improvements or additions to the State House. He also argued that the original design of the State House represented a pinnacle of architecture and that style must be strictly adhered to in future improvements. ‚ÄúThe restoration of this room [the Senate Chamber] to its original appearance is an obligation of duty we owe to ourselves and to the country. The mutilation of this hall is looked upon by all visitors as an act of vandalism and tends to bring our historical renown as one of the ‚Äòoriginal thirteen‚Äô into contempt. I would respectfully suggest the restoration of this room as nearly as possible to its original appearance to be preserved in this condition. . .‚ÄùPage (1981), p. 228. By the mid-1890s, the inside of the State House was also sorely in need of restorative work. It had fallen into such disrepair that wooden timbers were rotting, ceilings were sagging in places, and some of the walls were plastered over. On February 2, 1894, the Maryland State Senate requested that Mayer team up with Baltimore architect John Appleton Wilson to conduct a study of the feasibility of restoring the Old Senate Chamber to the condition it had been in when George Washington resigned his commission as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in 1783. After six weeks of working without pay, Mayer and Wilson reported back to the Senate on March 19, 1894. Their report listed items to be repaired, replaced or reproduced and estimated the total cost to be $6,150. They concluded their report with a recommendation that the work be started immediately. It was not until about eleven years later under Governor Edwin Warfield's leadership that Mayer and Wilson's recommendations were carried out and the Old Senate Chamber was fully restored to a satisfactory condition. Mayer expressed frustration over the legislature‚Äôs inaction on the State House, saying in a letter to his agent, John G. Hopkins, that ‚ÄúThey went back on me Completely in the State House Annex affairs and chose a very ordinary design in preference to a really beautiful and artistic plan. . . Evidently it was all preordained and shameless.‚Äù(Mayer to Hopkins, 20 July 1886). Personal life and death Mayer did not take a wife until he was 55 years old, when on February 12, 1883, he married the 27-year-old widow Ellen (or Ella) Benton Brewer. Mayer did not mention any children in his last will and testament of 1896, nor were there any children living at the time of Mayer's death in Annapolis on July 28, 1899. Mayer's body was interred at the Annapolis City Cemetery.

From the 16th to 12th centuries BC, kings of Kassite origin ruled in Babylon until they were overthrown by the Elamites. Vocabulary Based on the patchy distribution of extant cuneiform texts, the Semitic Akkadian language of the native Babylonians was mostly used for economic transactions during the Kassite period, with Sumerian used for monumental inscriptions. Traces of the Kassite language are few: * a Kassite-Babylonian vocabulary with 48 entries, listing bilingual equivalents of god names, common nouns, verbs, and adjective(s), such as daka≈° \\"star\\", ha≈°mar \\"falcon\\", ia≈°u \\"country\\", janzi \\"king\\", ma≈°·∏´u \\"deity\\", miria≈° \\"nether world\\", simbar \\"young\\", and ≈°imdi \\"to give\\"; on Archiv Tablet BM 93005. * the translations of 19 Kassite personal names on the fourth column of a neo-Assyrian era name list, which occasionally contradicts information given in the Kassite-Babylonian vocabulary);Tablet K. 4426 + Rm 617 (II R 65, No. 2; V R 44, treated in Balkan, Kassitenstudien, pp. 1‚Äì3) * scattered references in Akkadian Lexical lists to Kassite equivalents of divine names, plants, etc, for example the plant names included in the 4-tablet Babylonian Pharmacopoeia, uru.an.na = ma≈°takal, such as ·∏´a≈°imbur, kuru≈°, piriza·∏´ and ≈°agabigalzu, and terms in the 8-tablet synonym list Malku = ≈°arru, such as allak \\"rim\\" (of a wheel), and ·∏´ameru \\"foot\\"; * many proper names in a variety of Akkadian language documents, principally from Babylonia (especially in the period 1360‚Äì850 BC), from Nuzi and from Iran; giving names of deities, people, places and equids; * technical terms relating to animal husbandry, including marks and color designations of horses and asses, found in Akkadian documents, such as those found on a list of Kassite horse names, sambi·∏´aruk, meaning unknown,Tablet CBS 12617. and alzibadar, ·∏´ulalam, laga≈°takka≈°, pirma·∏´, ≈°imri≈°, and timira≈°, color and marking designations of equids; i≈°kamdi, \\"bit\\" for a horse; akkanda≈°, \\"spoke\\" of a wheel; kam≈´sa≈° and ≈°a·∏´uma≈° for bronze parts of a chariot, in contemporary texts; * scattered Kassite words, such as the title buga≈°; dardara·∏´, \\"small metal ornament\\"; and bazi·∏´arzi, a leather object, in an Akkadian context. A lack of Kassite texts makes the reconstruction of Kassite grammar impossible at present. Genetic relations of the Kassite language are unclear, although it is generally agreed that it was not Semitic; a relation with Elamite is doubtful. Relationship with or membership in the Hurro- Urartian family has been suggested, based on a number of words. It is not clear whether Kassite would be a distinct language in the Hurro-Urartian phylum, or simply a Southern dialect of Hurrian. If indeed the latter rather than the former, this could surmise that Kassites were merely a tribe of Khurrites that expanded from the north onto the south and settled in Mesopotamia. If Kassite is the former than the latter, this suggests that Hurro-Urartian was an even larger language group and more significant to the region than historical experts have observed and was perhaps spoken by far more many people than previously thought. Morphemes are not known; the words buri (ruler) and burna (protected) probably have the same root. Notes Sources * Ancilotti, A. La lingua dei Cassiti. Milan, 1980. * Balkan, K. Kassitenstudien. I.

Pads (also called leg guards) are protective equipment used by batters in the sport of cricket, catchers in the sports of baseball and fastpitch softball, and by goaltenders in ice hockey, bandy and box lacrosse. They serve to protect the legs from impact by a hard ball or puck at high speed which could otherwise cause injuries to the lower legs. Cricket In cricket, pads fall into two types, batting pads and wicket-keeper's pads. In Test and first-class cricket, the pads are white (to match the rest of the player's whites), while in limited overs cricket they may be coloured. Batting alt=a cricketer standing in front of some stumps, preparing to hit the ball Cricket pads first appeared in the mid-18th century in England. They were developed to protect the lower part of the legs from the hard leather ball that was used to bowl deliveries in the game. This was in response to the gradual evolution from underarm to sidearm and finally overarm bowling, which endangered the batsman's knees and shins. The development of pads led to a change in the Laws of Cricket with the addition of the dismissal for LBW. It was introduced in 1774 because batsmen had begun using their pads to deflect balls away from their wickets. Batting pads protect the shins, knees and the lower thigh. At the base, there is a slot for the foot. Traditional pads were made from canvas which had cotton stuffing inserted between stitched-in cane wood strips that ran vertically up to the knee roll. The material would then be painted white with water-soluble canvas paint. Leather buckles were used to bind the pad to the leg. These natural material pads were quite heavy. By contrast, modern day pads are now made from durable and ultra light synthetic materials such as PVC for the outer and polyesters for the lining. Most pads use three velcro fastening straps making them easily adjustable and removable. Batting pads are just one of the several protective layers worn by modern-day cricketers while batting. Other pads on the legs include a special knee roll to protect the knees or a thigh pad to protect the upper region of the leg. Within the professional game, players often insert extra padding beneath their pads to limit the impact from fast deliveries which can range in speed from . Wicketkeeping Originally, wicket-keepers used batting pads to protect their legs, but found the knee-protecting flaps interfered with their agility and ability to catch. There were also incidents where the ball lodged in the space between the flap and the wicket-keeper's leg. Modern wicket-keeper's pads are therefore smaller than batting pads, with insignificant knee flaps. Instead of three straps, these modern wicketkeeping pads have two straps: one at the bottom and the other one just below the knees. Other uses In stick- and-ball games, players that are exposed to the delivery of fast, hard balls to their legs, arms or body wear pads to protect themselves. The protective wear has led to changes in tactics that would otherwise be impossible without safety equipment.  Baseball and Softball  Leg Guards are an integral piece of equipment for Catchers playing both Baseball and Softball. They are designed to protect the Catcher's knees, shins, ankles, and the top areas of their feet from injury due to balls in the dirt and foul tips, and from general discomfort caused by constantly moving from a crouch to a blocking position throughout the game. Leg Guards are typically made out of some form of thick plastic with a harness system to keep them attached and in place. Ice hockey  Goaltender James Reimer using his pads during a warm-up drill In ice hockey, the goaltender wears large leg pads to protect him from low-down impact by a puck. To prevent these leg pads giving him advantage in defending the goal, there are restrictions on their size, which in recent years have been tightened by the National Hockey League. Traditional ice hockey leg pads were made of leather, but now lighter synthetic materials are used. Goaltenders' pads may be styled with geometric patterns for decoration. Field hockey  Hockey pads are either small shin guards for outfield players or, along with the other pads, goalkeeping pads, similar to those in cricket or ice hockey. Box lacrosse  In box lacrosse the goaltender wears leg pads to protect against the impact of shots low down (since the net is fairly low). There are restrictions on the dimensions of these pads, but unlike in ice hockey these relate to the depth of the pads.

History The theorem was proved in 1834 by Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi. Theorem Two representations are considered different if their terms are in different order or if the integer being squared (not just the square) is different; to illustrate, these are three of the eight different ways to represent 1: : \\\\begin{align} & 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ & 0^2 + 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ & (-1)^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2. \\\\end{align} The number of ways to represent n as the sum of four squares is eight times the sum of the divisors of n if n is odd and 24 times the sum of the odd divisors of n if n is even (see divisor function), i.e. : r_4(n)=\\\\begin{cases}8\\\\sum\\\\limits_{mn}m&\\\\text{if }n\\\\text{ is odd}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[12pt] 24\\\\sum\\\\limits_{\\\\begin{smallmatrix} mn \\\\\\\\\\\\ m\\\\text{ odd} \\\\end{smallmatrix}}m&\\\\text{if }n\\\\text{ is even}. \\\\end{cases} Equivalently, it is eight times the sum of all its divisors which are not divisible by 4, i.e. :r_4(n)=8\\\\sum_{m\\\\mid n ,\\\\, 4 mid m}m. We may also write this as :r_4(n) = 8 \\\\sigma(n) -32 \\\\sigma(n/4) \\\\ , where the second term is to be taken as zero if n is not divisible by 4. In particular, for a prime number p we have the explicit formula r4(p) = 8(p + 1).. Some values of r4(n) occur infinitely often as r4(n) = r4(2mn) whenever n is even. The values of r4(n)/n can be arbitrarily large: indeed, r4(n)/n is infinitely often larger than 8. Proof The theorem can be proved by elementary means starting with the Jacobi triple product. The proof shows that the Theta series for the lattice Z4 is a modular form of a certain level, and hence equals a linear combination of Eisenstein series.

Life Gordon's wife, Susanna Nicolet (1780) Robert Jacob Gordon was the son of Maj. General Jacob Gordon of the Scots Brigade (1572‚Äì1782) in the service of the Netherlands. Although of Scottish descent, Robert Gordon's allegiance and service lay with the Netherlands. He joined the Dutch Light Dragoons as a cadet in 1753 and enrolled at the University of Harderwijk in 1759. Here he studied in the humanities and soon proved to be of exceptional intelligence with diverse interests. He served at first with the Scots Brigade and later joined the Dutch East India Company, rising to the rank of colonel and commanding the Cape garrison between 1780 and 1795 and lived in the manor house known as Schoonder Sight. He went on more expeditions than any other 18th-century explorer of southern Africa. Of the six journeys he undertook, only four between 1777 and 1786 are covered by journals discovered in 1964. He was responsible for naming the Orange River, introducing Merino sheep to the Cape Colony and for the discovery of the remains of Bartolomeu Dias's padr√£o at Kwaaihoek in 1786. In addition to French, Dutch and English, he spoke the indigenous languages KhoeKhoe and Xhosa. First trip (1773‚Äì1774) During 1772/73 Robert visited the Cape Colony and met Carl Peter Thunberg and Francis Masson. They undertook a trip on foot exploring the mountains between Cape Town and False Bay. Besides his excursion with Thunberg and Masson, Gordon undertook one long journey during this period at the Cape, but there is no known record of his route. Second trip (1777‚Äì1778) He returned to the Cape in 1777 with the rank of Captain. He set out on a second trip from 6 October 1777 to 8 March 1778 together with William Paterson, the botanist, collector and affable companion, who soon turned back due to illness, and Johannes Schumacher/Schoemaker, an artist, Gordon left Cape Town for Swellendam. From there via Plattekloof to Beervlei and on to present-day Aberdeen. He continued across the Sneeuwberg to a point slightly west of Colesberg. He then roughly retraced his outbound route as far as the Sneeuwberg, the heading south-east to Cookhouse, from where he made various forays to meet Xhosa chiefs. One of Gordon's goals on this trip was reaching the Groote River, doing so by going north up the Great Fish, Tarka and Vlekpoort rivers to the confluence of the Groote River with the Caledon. Schoemaker accompanied Gordon on all his journeys, producing a fine record of their travels and causing present-day confusion as to which sketches are his and which Gordon's. Gordon was a diligent recorder of data such as altitude, compass headings and hours travelled and other information which he would later incorporate in a great map he planned. Paterson recorded that one of his aims on this trip was to meet with Xhosa chiefs near present-day Somerset East. For most of his journey he followed a well-travelled route, sometimes joined by others going the same way. His equipment was carried by a single wagon, while he was on horseback, ranging across the veld, observing, recording and occasionally hunting. Third trip (1778) A third trip lasting from September to October 1778, was made in the company of Governor van Plettenberg to the north-eastern frontiers of the Colony. Death (1795) As commander of the garrison, Gordon was responsible for the Cape's defense. In 1794-1795, the French successfully invaded the Netherlands. As a result, the Prince of Orange, as Stadtholder, the de facto head of state of the Dutch Republic, fled to England. In 1795, a British fleet arrived at the Cape claiming that they had instructions to occupy the colony in the Prince of Orange's name. Gordon initially complied, but was later accused of treason by his own soldiers for allowing the British occupation. Gordon had become an outcast and a target of derision and violence. On 25 October 1795 he committed suicide at his house Schoonder Sight. References *Botanical Exploration of Southern Africa - Mary Gunn & L.E.

It was commissioned by the impresario Jonathan Tyers for his famous pleasure gardens in London, Vauxhall Gardens. The composer is shown in the guise of Orpheus, holding a lyre. Despite the classical allusion, he wears informal contemporary dress: a soft cap, a long shirt open at the neck, a full loose gown, and slippers, one of which lies beneath his right foot. His pose is also casual. He is seated cross-legged, leaning on a pile of bound scores of his works, including Alexander's Feast, which was completed the same month the statue was finished. The statue is unprecedented, for not only was the sitter portrayed with startling informality, but it was the first life-size marble depicting a living artist. Until this date such public statues were erected only for monarchs, noblemen or military leaders. Roubiliac was a native of France, although his known surviving work was executed in England. Handel is his earliest known independent sculpture. When it went on display in Vauxhall Gardens in 1738 it proved an immediate success, helping to establish Roubiliac as one of the leading sculptors in England. Roubiliac was trained in Lyon, later working in Dresden under a leading Baroque sculptor, Balthasar Permoser (1651‚Äì1732), and then studying in Paris before moving to London in about 1730. All his known surviving works were executed in Britain. He specialised in portrait busts and funerary monuments, and was renowned for his handling of marble, particularly his creation of subtle surface textures.

History   Nomination as Eze Nri  Obalike mentioned a dream as central to his candidacy, as signs were supposedly given to the next Eze Nri spiritually, he is quoted saying: > One night Enwelana, the last Eze Nri, appeared to him and said he was the > chosen man; thereupon he proceeded to offer sacrifices.Dreaming, Religion > and Society in Africa By M. Charles J»©drej, Rosalind Shaw  British rule  Accompanied by British colonial authority, Christian missionaries, saw the existing ritual system of administration, based on traditional religious faith, as a barrier to the spread of their gospel. When the British continued to take over the administration of the Igbo in 1907, both the forces of the colonial authority and the Christian missionaries focused on destroying the Nri traditional authority. Military attempts to capture Nri and the Eze Nri ended in complete failure. However, forcing Eze Nri Obalike, against a long-standing tradition, to leave Nri town to attend the native at Awka by threatening to commit genocide against the Igbos, was one of the acts designed to achieve this end. Eze Nri Obalike agreed to leave Nri in order to save innocent lives. The government anthropologist, Northcote W. Thomas, confirmed that when Eze Nri Obalike appeared in the court, ‚Äòthe whole assembly rose and prepared to flee‚Äô. This is because, that was the first time an Eze Nri was seen in person. The final act of destruction, after the British introduced the warrant Chief system in 1911, was to force all chiefs and community leaders to denounce the Eze Nri. But before then, Eze Nri Obalike was also forced to annul all codes of taboo and abomination still binding the towns to Nri. It was as the result of this hostility that the ritual influence of Nri narrowed to the nearest relations of the kingship. These were made up of Nri (Agukwu, Akamkpisi and Diodo), Enugwu-Ukwu, Nawfia, Enugwu-Agidi and Oruora jointly referred to as Umunri. Though the five towns mentioned above are said to belong to Umu-Nri clan, they are not direct descendants of Nri Ifikuanim.http://www.enugwu-agidi.org/ea_history_nri.html Enugwu-Agidi History - The Nri Connection  References  Nri-Igbo Nri monarchs Kingdom of Nri 19th-century births 20th-century deaths Year of birth missing ","title":"Eze Nri √íbal√≠ke"},{"id":"18808805","text":"Ry≈çichi Yazu and his Patent Yazu Arithmometer. was a Japanese inventor. He is best known for his invention of Japan's first mechanical calculator.  Birth and education  Ry≈çichi Yazu was born in Buzen, Fukuoka as the son of a village mayor. He attended primary and middle school in his home village of Iwaya and the city of Buzen. At the age of 16 he left middle school and travelled to Osaka to pursue his interest in flight, studying mathematics and engineering at a private school in Osaka. At the age of 22 he returned to Buzen and began work on a thesis on the mechanics of flight. Two years later he brought the thesis and a model of his calculator on a visit to the novelist and army physician Mori ≈ågai. ≈ågai described this meeting with Yazu in the entry for 22 February 1901 in his Kokura Nikki (Kokura Diary). Impressed, ≈ågai wrote recommendations that led to a special research position at the Tokyo Imperial College of Engineering, where he worked on the design of a propeller- driven airplane.  Mechanical calculator  In March 1902 Yazu applied for a patent on his mechanical calculator, called the Yazu Arithmometer. It was a gear type calculator with a single cylinder and 22 gears, capable of arithmetic calculations up to 16 digits, with automatic carry and end of calculation functions. A special feature was that it accepted input in the biquinary number system familiar to users of the soroban (Japanese abacus). The patent was granted in 1903, and a shop was established to manufacture it. About 200 units were produced and sold, mainly to government agencies, including the Ministry of War, the Home Ministry, the statistics bureau, and agricultural experiment stations, and also to companies such as Nippon Railway. The calculator was expensive, costing 250 yen, more than ten times the monthly salary of a newspaper reporter or lower-level government official. Yazu invested the profits in a factory to build his airplane. But that project was abandoned after his untimely death from pleurisy at the age of 31. One of the calculators is preserved in the Kitaky≈´sh≈´ City Museum of Literature. In 2008 the Yazu Arithmometer was listed as item No. 30 in the Mechanical Engineering Heritage (Japan).

She was heavily armed and converted into a repair ship and spent her career in the South Pacific Ocean. At war's end she was used to transport troops home from the war.  Constructed in New Orleans, Louisiana  Burias (AG-69) was laid down on 11 February 1944 at New Orleans, Louisiana, by the Delta Shipbuilding Company, Inc., under a U.S. Maritime Commission contract (MCE hull 2458) as Mollie Moore Davis; launched on 27 March 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Paul L. Jahncke; delivered to the Navy on 24 April 1944; converted for naval service at Mobile, Alabama, by the Alabama Drydock Company; and commissioned there on 9 October 1944, Lt. William M. Aye, USNR, in command.  World War II service Burias conducted shakedown training in Chesapeake Bay. Following a final outfitting at Norfolk, Virginia, she got underway for the Pacific Ocean early in December. After a month-long voyage during which she transited the Panama Canal, the ship arrived at Pearl Harbor on 7 January 1945. At the Oahu base, she underwent conversion to an electronics repair ship. She completed the conversion within two months and, early in March, received orders to join that portion of Service Squadron (ServRon) 10 stationed at Saipan in the Mariana Islands. There, she spent the remainder of World War II working in conjunction with and making hull and electronic repairs to warships damaged at Iwo Jima and in the long Okinawa campaign.  End-of-war operations  She departed Saipan on 30 October 1945 and arrived at Wakayama, Japan, on 5 November. Burias took on board servicemen on their way home at Wakayama and got underway for the U.S. West Coast on 10 November 1945. The ship arrived at San Francisco, California, on 28 November and disembarked her passengers. Two days later, she put to sea bound for Bremerton, Washington. Post-war inactivation She reached Bremerton on 3 December and soon began decommissioning preparations. The ship then moved to Seattle, Washington, on 23 January 1946 for the removal of her 20 millimeter antiaircraft guns and of some electronics equipment still on board. Temporary reactivation On 11 February, however, decommissioning preparations stopped, and she got underway for Hawaii with passengers embarked. Burias entered Pearl Harbor on 21 February, disembarked her passengers, and resumed stripping operations. Final dispositioning She was placed out of commission at Pearl Harbor on 9 April 1946. Burias remained in Hawaii until March 1947 at which time she was towed to San Francisco. Declared surplus to the needs of the Navy late in June, she had her name struck from the Navy List on 17 July 1947. On 15 August 1947, the ship was turned over to the U.S. Maritime Commission to be laid up with the National Defense Reserve Fleet group berthed at Suisun Bay, California. She remained there for more than two decades until 2 November 1970 when she was sold to Zidell Explorations, Inc., of Portland, Oregon, for scrapping.

He signed for the club after the club scouted him using the online footballing database application, InStat, and invited him to Singapore. Tshibamba signed after being convinced that the club would be challenging for silverwares, something that Tshibamba has not been able to achieve with his past eleven clubs. He made his debut for the Warriors in a 1‚Äì1 draw against Geylang International in match day 2 of the S.League season. Tshibamba almost scored on his debut as his header came off the post in the 35th minute. He got his first goals for the club on 8 April 2017 in a 4‚Äì3 win over Garena Young Lions, scoring a brace to help his club claw back from 1‚Äì3 down in the last 10 minutes.

She served as dean of the College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences at Flinders University in 2017-2018, and as head of the Department of Archaeology. She served two terms as president of the World Archaeological Congress from 2003 to 2014 and greatly increased the organization's size and visibility. Among her 12 books and 150 articles is the 11-volume Encyclopedia of Global Archaeology (Springer 2014), for which she served as general editor and which is being produced in a second edition.  Education and career  Smith obtained a bachelor's degree in archaeology from the University of New England in 1990, and a PhD from the same university in 1996. Her doctoral thesis was an ethnoarchaeological study of Australian Aboriginal art. She also wrote a book called, \\"Decolonizing Indigenous Archaeology.\\" After that she held an Australian Research Council Postdoctoral Fellowship and a Fulbright Postdoctoral Fellowship. With her husband, Gary Jackson, Smith has conducted long term field research in the Aboriginal community of Barunga. She has brought Aboriginal students to train in Adelaide, created archaeological field schools for Aboriginal students, and has been a major contributor to the development of Indigenous Archaeology, both in Australia and elsewhere in the world. Her tenure at the helm of World Archaeological Congress included creation of a scholarly journal for the organization, Archaeologies,https://link.springer.com/journal/11759 as well as outreach programs such as Archaeologists without Borders and the Global Libraries Project.https://worldarch.org/get-involved/ Her scholarly output has largely focused on the relationship between archaeologists and indigenous communities, both in Australia and around the world. She has also given attention to general interests for teaching archaeology, such as her Archaeology to Delight and Instruct, and practicing it, such as Digging It Up Down Under. Her archaeological field methods textbook for introductory students has gone through two editions in Australia and was published in an American edition. Her interest in bringing heritage and community archaeology issues to public attention, particularly the plight of Aboriginal peoples in Australia, has led to a series of articles in the Australian news source The Conversation on these topics. Smith has been awarded 2018 Lucy Mair Medal and Marsh Award of the Royal Anthropological Institute (2018), a Commemorative Medal from Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (2018), Lifetime Achievement Award of the World Archaeological Congress (2016), and was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (2010).

Attacks  On 20 July 2008, weeks before the Russian invasion of Georgia, the \\"zombie\\" computers were already on the attack against Georgia. The website of the Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili was targeted, resulting in overloading the site. The traffic directed at the Web site included the phrase \\"win+love+in+Rusia\\". The site then was taken down for 24 hours. On 5 August 2008, the websites for OSInform News Agency and OSRadio were hacked. The OSinform website at osinform.ru kept its header and logo, but its content was replaced by the content of Alania TV website. Alania TV, a Georgian government supported television station aimed at audiences in South Ossetia, denied any involvement in the hacking of the rival news agency website. Dmitry Medoyev, the South Ossetian envoy to Moscow, claimed that Georgia was attempting to cover up the deaths of 29 Georgian servicemen during the flare-up on August 1 and 2. On 5 August, Baku‚ÄìTbilisi‚ÄìCeyhan pipeline was subject to a terrorist attack near Refahiye in Turkey, responsibility for which was originally taken by Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) but there is circumstantial evidence that it was instead a sophisticated computer attack on line's control and safety systems that led to increased pressure and explosion. According to Jart Armin, a researcher, many Georgian Internet servers were under external control since late 7 August 2008. On 8 August, the DDoS attacks peaked and the defacements began. On 9 August 2008, key sections of Georgia's Internet traffic reportedly had been rerouted through servers based in Russia and Turkey, where the traffic was either blocked or diverted. The Russian and Turkish servers were allegedly controlled by the Russian hackers. Later on the same day, the network administrators in Germany were able to temporarily reroute some Georgian Internet traffic directly to servers run by Deutsche Telekom AG. However, within hours the traffic was again diverted to Moscow-based servers. On 10 August 2008, RIA Novosti news agency's website was disabled for several hours by a series of attacks. Maxim Kuznetsov, head of the agency's IT department said: \\"The DNS-servers and the site itself have been coming under severe attack.\\" On 10 August, Jart Armin warned that Georgian sites that were online might have been fake. \\"Use caution with any Web sites that appear of a Georgia official source but are without any recent news [such as those dated Saturday, Aug. 9, or Sunday, Aug. 10], as these may be fraudulent,\\" he said. By 11 August 2008, the website of the Georgian president had been defaced and images comparing President Saakashvili to Adolf Hitler were posted. This was an example of cyber warfare combined with PSYOPs. Georgian Parliament's site was also targeted. Some Georgian commercial websites were also attacked. On 11 August, Georgia accused Russia of waging cyber warfare on Georgian government websites simultaneously with a military offensive. The Foreign Ministry of Georgia said in a statement, \\"A cyber warfare campaign by Russia is seriously disrupting many Georgian websites, including that of the Foreign Affairs Ministry.\\" A Kremlin spokesman denied the accusation and said, \\"On the contrary, a number of internet sites belonging to the Russian media and official organizations have fallen victim to concerted hacker attacks.\\" The Ministry of Foreign Affairs set up a blog on Google's Blogger service as a temporary site. The Georgian President's site was moved to US servers. The National Bank of Georgia‚Äôs Web site had been defaced at one point and 20th-century dictators' images and an image of Georgian president Saakashvili were placed. The Georgian Parliament website was defaced by the \\"South Ossetia Hack Crew\\" and the content was replaced with images comparing President Saakashvili to Hitler. Estonia offered hosting for Georgian governmental website and cyberdefense advisors. However a spokesman from Estonia's Development Centre of State Information Systems said Georgia didn't request help. \\"This will be decided by the government,\\" he said. It was reported that the Russians bombed Georgia‚Äôs telecommunications infrastructure, including cell towers. Private United States companies also assisted the Georgian government to protect its non-war making information such as the government payroll during the conflict.Steven Korns and Joshua E. Kastenberg, Georgia's Cyber Left Hook, Parameters: Journal of the Army War College (2008), 59-64 Russian hackers also attacked the servers of the Azerbaijani Day.Az news agency. The reason was Day.Az position in covering the Russian-Georgian conflict. ANS.az, one of the leading news websites in Azerbaijan, was also attacked. Russian intelligence services had also disabled the information websites of Georgia during the war. The Georgian news site Civil Georgia switched their operations to one of Google's Blogspot domains. Despite the cyber-attacks, Georgian journalists managed to report on the war. Many media professionals and citizen journalists set up blogs to report or comment on the war. Barack Obama, the U.S. presidential candidate demanded Russia halt the internet attacks as well as complying with a ceasefire on the ground. The President of Poland, Lech Kaczy≈Ñski, said that Russia was blocking Georgian \\"internet portals\\" to supplement its military aggression. He offered his own website to Georgia to aid in the \\"dissemination of information\\". Reporters Without Borders condemned the violations of online freedom of information since the outbreak of hostilities between Georgia and Russia. \\"The Internet has become a battleground in which information is the first victim,\\" it said. The attacks involved Denial-of-service attacks. The New York Times reported on 12 August that according to some experts, it was the first time in history a known cyberattack had coincided with a shooting war. On 12 August, the attacks continued, controlled by programs that were located in hosting centers controlled by a Russian telecommunications companies. A Russian-language site, stopgeorgia.ru, continued to operate and offer software for Denial-of-service attacks. RT reported on 12 August that during the previous 24 hours its website had been attacked. The security specialists said that the initial attacker was an IP-address registered in the Georgian capital Tbilisi. On 14 August 2008, it was reported that although a ceasefire reached, major Georgian servers were still down, hindering communication in Georgia.  Analysis  The Russian government denied the allegations that it was behind the attacks, stating that it was possible that \\"individuals in Russia or elsewhere had taken it upon themselves to start the attacks\\". Some sources have suggested that the Saint Petersburg-based criminal gang known as the Russian Business Network (RBN) was behind many of these cyber attacks. RBN was considered to be among the world's worst spammer, child-pornography, malware, phishing and cybercrime hosting networks. It is thought that the RBN's leader and creator, known as Flyman, is the nephew of a powerful and well-connected Russian politician. Dancho Danchev, a Bulgarian Internet security analyst claimed that the Russian attacks on Georgian websites used ‚Äúall the success factors for total outsourcing of the bandwidth capacity and legal responsibility to the average Internet user.‚Äù Jose Nazario, security researcher for Arbor Networks, told CNET that he was seeing evidence that Georgia was responding to the cyber attacks, attacking at least one Moscow-based newspaper site. Don Jackson, director of threat intelligence for SecureWorks, a computer security firm based in Atlanta, noted that in the run-up to the war over the weekend, computer researchers had observed as botnets were \\"staged\\" in preparation for the attack, and then activated shortly before Russian air strikes began on 9 August. Gadi Evron, the former chief of Israel's Computer Emergency Response Team, believed the attacks on Georgian internet infrastructure resembled a cyber-riot, rather than cyber-warfare. Evron admitted the attacks could be \\"indirect Russian (military) action,\\" but pointed out the attackers \\"could have attacked more strategic targets or eliminated the (Georgian Internet) infrastructure kinetically.\\" Shadowserver registered six different botnets involved in the attacks, each controlled by a different command server. Jonathan Zittrain, cofounder of Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society, said that the Russian military definitely had the means to attack Georgia's Internet infrastructure. Bill Woodcock, the research director at Packet Clearing House, a California-based nonprofit group that tracked Internet security trends, said the attacks bore the markings of a \\"trained and centrally coordinated cadre of professionals.\\" Russian hackers also brought down the Russian newspaper Skandaly.ru allegedly for expressing some pro- Georgian sentiment. \\"This was the first time that they ever attacked an internal and an external target as part of the same attack,\\" Woodcock said. Gary Warner, a cybercrime expert at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said that he found \\"copies of the attack script\\" (used against Georgia), complete with instructions for use, posted in the reader comments section at the bottom of virtually every story in the Russian media. Bill Woodcock also said cyberattacks are so cheap and easy to stage, with few fingerprints, they would almost definitely stay around as a feature of modern warfare. The Economist wrote that anyone who wished to take part in the cyberattack on Georgia could do so from anywhere with an internet connection, by visiting one of pro-Russia websites and downloading the software and instructions needed to perform a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) attack. One website, called StopGeorgia, provided a utility called DoSHTTP, plus a list of targets, including Georgian government agencies and the British and American embassies in Tbilisi. Launching an attack simply required entering the address and clicking a button labelled \\"Start Flood\\". The StopGeorgia website also indicated which target sites were still active and which had collapsed. Other websites explained how to write simple programs for sending a flood of requests, or offered specially formatted webpages that could be set to reload themselves repeatedly, barraging particular Georgian websites with traffic. There was no conclusive evidence that the attacks was executed or sanctioned by the Russian government and also there was no evidence that it tried to stop them. In March 2009, Security researchers from Greylogic concluded that Russia's GRU and the FSB were likely to have played a key role in co- coordinating and organizing the attacks. The Stopgeorgia.ru forum was a front for state-sponsored attacks. John Bumgarner, member of the United States Cyber Consequences Unit (US-CCU) did a research on the cyberattacks during the Russo-Georgian War. The report concluded that the cyber-attacks against Georgia launched by Russian hackers in 2008 demonstrated the need for international cooperation for security. The report stated that the organizers of the cyber-attacks were aware of Russia's military plans, but the attackers themselves were believed to have been civilians. Bumgarner‚Äôs research concluded that the first-wave of cyber-attacks launched against Georgian media sites were in line with tactics used in military operations. \\"Most of the cyber-attack tools used in the campaign appear to have been written or customized to some degree specifically for the campaign against Georgia,\\" the research stated. While the cyberattackers appeared to have had advance notice of the invasion and the benefit of some close cooperation from the state institutions, there were no fingerprints directly linking the attacks to the Russian government or military.

He intercepted hundreds of French ships for gold, wine, exotic fruits and brought it back to the people of Poole. Paye led naval raids along the coast of France and Spain from Normandy through to the Bay of Biscay and Cape Finisterre. He burnt Gijon and Finisterra to the ground, taking many prisoners and exacting ransoms, and in 1398 he raided the Church of Saint Mary in Finisterra and stole a valuable crucifix.

In 1405, a combined fleet of French and Spanish ships attacked Paye's native town of Poole in retaliation for Paye's raids. The attackers looted arms and stores and set fire to a warehouse before they were driven back to their ships by the townspeople.

W. Hornung. It was published in the UK by Grant Richards, London, and in the US by Scribner's, New York under the title Raffles: Further Adventures of the Amateur Cracksman.Rowland, page 280. It is the second collection of stories in Hornung's series concerning A. J. Raffles, a gentleman thief in late Victorian London. Several of the stories were adapted for the 1977 Raffles television series. Overview Following the events of the final story of the preceding short story collection, the reputations of A. J. Raffles and his companion Bunny Manders are ruined. Raffles is assumed to have drowned in the Mediterranean, and Bunny has faced eighteen months in prison and is struggling to get back on his feet. The eight stories in this collection follow their remarkable reunion, and their joint return to crime, though as hardened criminals rather than respectable gentlemen. The stories are in chronological order, yet each is mostly independent and can be read separately. Contents frontispiece by F. C. Yohn The collection begins with a Narrator's Note, which explains that Raffles and Bunny are no longer the dapper gentlemen thieves they once were, but are now hardened, professional criminals. # \\"No Sinecure\\" ‚Äî Bunny, recently released from prison and struggling to survive as a writer, answers a curious advertisement seeking a male nurse of liberal education for an old, ailing man named Mr. Maturin. # \\"A Jubilee Present\\" ‚Äî When Raffles sets his heart on stealing a priceless gold cup from the British Museum, he and Bunny go to scope out the museum's security. # \\"The Fate of Faustina\\" ‚Äî Raffles tells Bunny of his time spent as a tramp in Italy for the two years after his supposed death in the Mediterranean, including the tragic tale of the beautiful woman he loved and lost. # \\"The Last Laugh\\" ‚Äî The Italians who Raffles antagonized while in Italy finally take their revenge against Raffles. # \\"To Catch a Thief\\" ‚Äî There's a new gentleman burglar in London, and Raffles suggests to Bunny that they make him their third partner. # \\"An Old Flame\\" ‚Äî After a woman from Raffles's past recognizes him, her unwelcome determination to rekindle their old relationship forces Raffles to take extreme measures. # \\"The Wrong House\\" ‚Äî From their new location in the suburbs, and in the midst of a series of their burglaries, Raffles and Bunny go out on their bicycles to burgle the vulnerable house of a stockbroker. # \\"The Knees of the Gods\\" ‚Äî Raffles and Bunny enlist in the British volunteer forces to fight in the Second Boer War.

She was a granddaughter of German diplomat Count Friedrich Wilhelm Bismarck (1783-1860) on her mother's side, and of novelist Eliza Wille (1809-1893) on her father's side. She was an equestrian sportswoman competing in main show jumping events in Switzerland and Germany, including the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. She is also known for her detailed photographic family diary, and as the mother of novelist, travel literature writer and photographer Annemarie Schwarzenbach.  Life  Ren√©e Schwarzenbach was the daughter of Swiss General Ulrich Wille and Countess Clara von Bismarck. Her father was head of the Swiss army during World War I. In 1904 she married Alfred Schwarzenbach, a wealthy businessman in the silk industry. They had five children. She was a passionate horsewoman, photographer (which she first became interested in at the age of 14) and music-lover ‚Äî in particular of Wagner. After her marriage she chronicled the family life on their Bocken Estate in Horgen near Lake Z√ºrich in a detailed photographic diary. At her death she had filled 64 photo-albums, containing approx. 10,000 photos in total. Although she devoted herself to her husband and family she also had a long-term affair with the German opera singer Emmy Kr√ºger. Ren√©e held political sympathies towards Germany, whether the Kaiser, Hitler or Adenauer was in power. During her many stays in Munich with her mistress, she saw the rise of Nazism as a way of overcoming the humiliating Treaty of Versailles. German diplomats in Switzerland praised her loyalty to the Nazi cause in their reports.Schwarzenbach, Alexis (2008/2011). Auf der Schwelle des Fremden. Das Leben der Annemarie Schwarzenbach. M√ºnchen: Collection Rolf Heyne, page 224-225. After World War II, she helped out those Germans who had fled to Switzerland to escape the Allies. She is known for her dominating personality, and had a difficult relationship with her second daughter Annemarie, writer, photographer and traveller, partly due to the political differences between the two woman, Ren√©e being pro-German throughout the Nazi period, and Annemarie holding pronouncedly anti-fascist views.

year of a rebranded Australian National Soccer League (NSL) and the twentieth since the national league began in 1977. The competition was variously known as the A-League and the Ericsson Cup (as part of a sponsorship arrangement) at the time. Background After an attempt to reduce the number of NSL teams from 14 to 12, the Australian Soccer Federation announced that a new competition known as the A-League would operate in parallel to the NSL. After a series of legal challenges, the A-League became the sole national league with largely the same composition of teams as the previous NSL season. The change was seen at the time as a rebranding rather than a new competition. Prior to the season beginning, the league announced a sponsorship agreement with Ericsson that was supposed to last until 2000. The sponsorship led to the league being renamed the Ericsson Cup, though the A-League and NSL names were still used in various forms. The commencement of the season was delayed as relegated teams Melbourne SC and Heidelberg United obtained court injunctions to prevent the league going ahead. Eventually the injunction was lifted in the Federal Court of Australia to allow the league to start, albeit several weeks late. Overview The league was composed of 12 teams. After 33 rounds, Marconi-Fairfield were crowned minor premiers. In the final series, Marconi-Fairfield and the Melbourne Knights contested the 1996 A-League Grand Final, with Melbourne Knights prevailing 2‚Äì1.

Blindness overtook him at the age of thirty-five, and he was known as \\"The Blind Father\\". Life He was the son of a lawyer at Dole, of a family, which during the previous century had attained to a high position in the magistracy and was renowned for the piety and virtue of its members. Owing to the early loss of his father, his education devolved upon his mother who devoted herself to his spiritual advancement. Having studied theology at the University of Dole, he fell under the influence of Berulle and entered the Oratory in 1614, three years after its foundation. He was appointed director of the seminary at Langres but soon found his vocation in mission work among the poor. His life was unmarked by any external event except the loss of sight which occurred in 1627, while he was preaching the Lenten course at Rouen, but this caused no cessation in his work. The bishops employed him in preaching the Lent and Advent courses and the Government in the conversion of Protestants. He avoided the custom of treating controversial matter in the pulpit and confined himself to the exposition of fundamental truths. It was a novel idea of his to introduce after his discourses an abridgement of Christian doctrine. He also held conferences for the instruction of the clergy in his methods and was recommended by Massillon to young ecclesiastics for their imitation. The French Oratory was suspected of Jansenism, and he was himself criticized on the ground that his preaching led to unsatisfactory results. In 1600 he appealed for advice to Antoine Arnauld, who ascribed these results to the laxity of confessors under the influence of casuistry, and dissuaded him from the design of abandoning his mission work. Works His sermons in twelve volumes were published at Toulouse, Paris, and Rouen before his death, and a Latin translation at Mainz in 1667. There is an edition published at Lyons in 1826, but the latest and best edition is that of Peltier in ten volumes issued in 1889. Four volumes of extracts also appeared at Avignon in 1825 under title of \\"Pens√©es du P. Lejeune\\".

After redshirting during the 1988 season, Hughes set a team record for freshman receiving yards with 471 yards on 28 receptions in 1989. That team record stood until the 2006 season when freshman Dominique Douglas passed Hughes to become Iowa‚Äôs all-time freshman receiving leader. Hughes ranks 3rd on Iowa‚Äôs all-time career receiving list, behind only Derrell Johnson-Koulianos with 168 receptions for 2544 career yards and Tim Dwight, with 146 receptions for 2,216 career yards. His 21 career touchdown receptions are tied with Dwight for second most in team history behind Marvin McNutt. Hughes, along with quarterback Matt Rodgers and the running tandem of Nick Bell and Tony Stewart, helped lead the Hawkeyes back to the 1991 Rose Bowl where Iowa lost to Washington 46-34. Iowa also was invited to the 1991 Holiday Bowl the next season in Danan‚Äôs junior year and played BYU to a 13-13 tie. On November 23, 1991, during the final game of the regular season, Hughes was on the receiving end of one of Matt Rodger‚Äôs 3 touchdown passes against Minnesota in the classic ‚ÄúSnow Game‚Äù.

Life Correa was born in Mascaraque; his date of birth has been determined to be around 1510. Records show he grew up wealthy. When Juan was 17 or 18 years old he joined an artist workshop in Burgundy where he met with many other Spanish artists at the time, including Pedro de Cisneros, whom he befriended. Juan's brother Eufrasia and Eufrasia's son Rodrigo also grew up to be artists. Rodrigo was apprenticed with his uncle, and continued some of his uncle's works after his death. In Mascaraque, Juan was a substantial landowner with a nice house where he did much of his painting. He took frequent trips but always stayed in the Toledo area. Juan was married and a religious man. It can be seen in his testament: a copy was found in the church files of Mascaraque. When he died, Juan split all his possessions between his nephew Rodrigo and the church of Mascaraque. Juan was a well-regarded painter during his life, but many records were lost. His works and life were brought to light again when the researcher and art historian Ce√°n Bermudez in 1800 published a dictionary of famous artists and included a brief article about his works and Italian influences. The full reconstruction of its biography has been primarily accomplished in the 20th century. Records show Juan died on 16 April 1566 in San Miguel. Juan's body was taken back to Mascaraque, where he was buried in the same plot where his parents were laid to rest. Many members of the artistic community came to the funeral service, including architects Alonso de Covarrubias and Nicol√°s de Vergara, the sculptor Francisco de Linares, and the painters Diego de Aguilar and Blas Pabl√≠n. Works Juan was heavily influenced by Raphael. One of his most important works was the altarpiece of the church of Almonacid de Zorita, in the province of Guadalajara. This work was done in collaboration with Alonso de Covarrubias. It was destroyed in Spanish Civil War in 1936-39. From Raphael he took his colorful tone and delicate and smooth figures. Over the years his style evolved into more dynamic forms of Mannerism, especially with respect to the way to bring about violent movement in the figures. In the province of Toledo have been found some of Juan's better known works. They include the altarpiece of San Roque, in Almorox, and the altarpiece of the collegiate church of Torrijos, whose twelve tables were done with the help of students of their factory. The Museo del Prado of Madrid also includes many excellent examples of his work. His first independent works began when he was twenty years old. Some of the work came to him through familiar contacts. For example, Juan's paintings for the greater altarpiece of Clarisas of Nectarine, dated between 1532 and 1534, were funded by his uncle Don Rodrigo de Vivar. Included works in these early years are also the table of the Birth of the Santa Mar√≠a de Guadalupe monastery and the altarpiece of identical subject that Juan did for Stewing, which today can be found in both the Museo del Prado and the Museum of Santa Cruz de Toledo. The influence of his teacher, very evident in these first works, became more diluted over the years. Some of his masterpieces from the 1540s can be found at the monastery of San Martin de Valdeiglesias today. There were also highly admired altarpieces that were taken after the ecclesiastical confiscation of 1836 and given to the Prado, other pinacotecas like those of Saragossa or Vigo, and churches like San Jer√≥nimo el Real of Madrid. Between 1550 and 1566, the year of his death, Juan's style became more personal, taking on a mannerism style that makes his figures more forceful and energetic, but without losing his traditional elegance.

This usually consists of at least; a principal performer, a melodic accompaniment, a rhythm accompaniment, and a drone. The tambura is the traditional drone instrument used in concerts, however, tamburas are increasingly being replaced by ≈õruti boxes, and now more commonly, the \\"electronic tambura\\". The drone itself is an integral part of performances and furnishes stability - the equivalent of harmony in Western music. Performances can be musical or musical-dramatic. Musical recitals are either vocal, or purely instrumental in nature, while musical-dramatic recitals refer to Harikatha. But irrespective of what type of recital it is, what is featured are compositions which form the core of this genre of music. Instrumentation The tambura is the traditional drone instrument used in concerts. However, tamburas are increasingly being replaced by ≈õruti boxes, and now more commonly, the electronic tambura. The drone itself is an integral part of performances and furnishes stability ‚Äì the equivalent of harmony in Western music. In a vocal recital, a concert team may have one or more vocalists as the principal performer(s). Instruments, such as the Saraswati veena and/or venu flute, can be occasionally found as a rhythmic accompaniment, but usually, a vocalist is supported by a violin player (who sits on his/her left). The rhythm accompanist is usually a mridangam player (who sits on the other side, facing the violin player). However, other percussion instruments such as the ghatam, kanjira and morsing frequently also accompany the main percussion instrument and play in an almost contrapuntal fashion along with the beats. The objective of the accompanying instruments is far more than following the melody and keeping the beats. The accompaniments form an integral part of every composition presented, and they closely follow and augment the melodic phrases outlined by the lead singer. The vocalist and the violinist take turns while elaborating or while exhibiting creativity in sections like raga, niraval and kalpanaswaram. Unlike Hindustani music concerts, where an accompanying tabla player can keep beats without following the musical phrases at times, in Carnatic music, the accompanists have to follow the intricacies of the composition since there are percussion elements such as eduppu in several compositions. Some concerts feature a good bit of interaction with the lead musicians and accompanists exchanging notes, and accompanying musicians predicting the lead musician's musical phrases. Concert content Development of concert format The late Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar, a veteran Carnatic music vocalist, is credited with establishing the contemporary concert format which has been in use by Carnatic musicians to this day. Contemporary concert content A contemporary Carnatic concert (called a katcheri) usually lasts about three hours, and usually comprises a number of varied compositions. Carnatic songs are composed in a particular raga, which means that they do not deviate from the notes in the raga. Each composition is set with specific notes and beats, but performers improvise extensively. Improvisation occurs in the melody of the composition as well as in using the notes to expound the beauty of the raga. Concerts usually begin with a varnam or an invocatory item which will act as the opening piece. The varnam is composed with an emphasis on swaras of the raga, but will also have lyrics, the saahityam. It is lively and fast to get the audience's attention. An invocatory item, may alternatively, follow the varnam. After the varnam and/or invocatory item, the artist sings longer compositions called kirtanas (commonly referred to as kritis). Each kriti sticks to one specific raga, although some are composed with more than one raga; these are known as ragamalika (a garland of ragas). After singing the opening kriti, usually, the performer sings the kalpanaswaram of the raga to the beat. The performer must improvise a string of swaras in any octave according to the rules of the raga and return to beginning of the cycle of beats smoothly, joining the swaras with a phrase selected from the kriti. The violin performs these alternately with the main performer. In very long strings of swara, the performers must calculate their notes accurately to ensure that they stick to the raga, have no awkward pauses and lapses in the beat of the song, and create a complex pattern of notes that an experienced audience can follow. Performers then begin the main compositions with a section called raga alapana exploring the raga. In this, they use the sounds aa, ri, na, ta, etc. instead of swaras to slowly elaborate the notes and flow of the raga. This begins slowly and builds to a crescendo, and finally establishes a complicated exposition of the raga that shows the performer's skill. All of this is done without any rhythmic accompaniment, or beat. Then the melodic accompaniment (violin or veena), expounds the raga. Experienced listeners can identify many ragas after they hear just a few notes. With the raga thus established, the song begins, usually with lyrics. In this, the accompaniment (usually violin, sometimes veena) performs along with the main performer and the percussion (such as a mridangam). In the next stage of the song, they may sing niraval or kalpanaswaram again. In most concerts, the main item will at least have a section at the end of the item, for the percussion to perform solo (called the tani avartanam). The percussion performers perform complex patterns of rhythm and display their skill. If multiple percussion instruments are employed, they engage in a rhythmic dialogue until the main performer picks up the melody once again. Some experienced artists may follow the main piece with a ragam thanam pallavi mid-concert, if they do not use it as the main item. Following the main composition, the concert continues with shorter and lighter songs. Some of the types of songs performed towards the end of the concerts are tillanas and thukkadas - bits of popular kritis or compositions requested by the audience. Every concert that is the last of the day ends with a mangalam, a thankful prayer and conclusion to the musical event. Audience The audience of a typical concert has a reasonable understanding of Carnatic music. It is also typical to see the audience tapping out the tala in sync with the artist's performance. As and when the artist exhibits creativity, the audience acknowledge it by clapping their hands. With experienced artists, towards the middle of the concert, requests start flowing in. The artist usually plays the request and it helps in exhibiting the artist's broad knowledge of the several thousand kritis that are in existence. Modern concerts Every December, the city of Chennai in India has its six-week-long Music Season, which has been described as the world's largest cultural event. The Music Season was started in 1927, to mark the opening of the Madras Music Academy. It used to be a traditional month- long Carnatic music festival, but since then it has also diversified into dance and drama, as well as non-Carnatic art forms. The music season in Chennai is in the month of Margashira - Marghazhi in Tamil and comes to an end with the festival of Makara Shankrati or Pongal. The cultural hub of Karnataka, Mysore - Bangalore region celebrates its Music Season known as Ramnavami Music Festival for a period of 45 days. Unlike the Madras Season which are held in closed auditoriums, the Ramanavami Music Festival is mostly held in Open Air Aoditoriums. The pleasant Chaitra - month of Kannada Calendar and evening showers make up the event much more celebrous. In Mysore, the concerts are held in Shri Bidaram Krishnappa Mandira and Jaganmohana Palace. Apart from these, many other smaller sabhas in Bangalore, Mysore, Hassan, Shimoga and Chikmagalur also conduct concerts in this festive season.

This image of Salisbury Cathedral, one of England's most famous medieval churches, is one of his most celebrated works, and was commissioned by one of his closest friends, John Fisher, The Bishop of Salisbury.V&A; page The 1823 version of the painting has been in the collection of the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, since its bequest in 1857.V&A; History Salisbury Cathedral from the Bishop's Grounds, 1825, Frick Collection Constable visited Salisbury in 1811 and made a series of sketches of the cathedral, from the south-east, the south-west and from the east end.NGA The artist selected a viewpoint from the bishop's garden (the south-west) and returned in 1820 to make further drawings and an open-air oil sketch, now in the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa,National Gallery of Canada page which served as the model for the London version. Included in the paintings are figures of Dr. Fisher and his wife at the bottom left. Following the exhibition of the London version at the 1823 Royal Academy, Constable observed: \\"My Cathedral looks very well....It was the most difficult subject in Landscape I ever had upon my Easel. I have not flinched at the work of the windows, buttresses, &c.; ‚Äì but I have as usual made my escape in the Evanescence of the Chiaro-Oscuro\\". His patron took exception to the dark cloud over the cathedral, and when he commissioned a smaller replica, requested \\"a more serene sky\\". A full scale replica of the painting also resides at the Frick Collection in New York City. It is slightly different in that it shows different weather and hence light. Whereas the London version depicts the cathedral with an overcast sky, the version in the Frick shows the cathedral with a clear, bright sky. It was executed in 1825 after Fisher requested, in a letter, that Constable repaint the sky in the London version.NGA Unfortunately Fisher died before Constable completed the work.

Known to many as the Wizard, Lee's designs achieved notoriety in the 1970s, with Chutzpah and Merlin having won the Transpacific Yacht Race from Los Angeles to Honolulu many times. Merlin set and held the course record between 1977 and 1997, making the 1977 crossing in only 8 days, 11 hours and 1 minute. Life Early life Originally from Idaho, Bill's family moved to Pasadena, California when bill was eight years old. When Bill was fifteen years old, his family moved again to Orange County's Newport Beach where he first began to sail in El Toro dinghies at age 15. Newport Beach provided many opportunities for Bill to interact with yachts, from the Sea Scouts to competitive ocean yachts. Bill Lee graduated from Cal Poly at San Luis Obispo in 1965 with a degree in mechanical engineering. His first job as an engineer was in Southern California in the defense industry evaluating armored personnel carriers, as well as other similar military tools. His evaluations included stress and weight analysis. Santa Cruz Boat Building At age 26, Lee first visited Santa Cruz with friends and began sailing in the Monterey Bay. This year, because of the presence of the 5O5 World Championship in Santa Cruz, Lee imagined building a 30-foot 5O5 and put himself to the task. The boat was completed in 1970 and was named Magic. Magic displaced 2,500 pounds and carried close to 450 square feet of sail and won the Monterey Bay series the following spring. The following year, Lee crewed for Art Biehi in Lee's first Transpacific Yacht Race where he was exposed to the conditions of the race and the expectations for victory. Lee is quoted reflecting to Biehi on how to win, \\"I told him that to win the Transpac (under the old conditions) you needed the smallest possible boat, the lowest possible rating, and the lightest possible boat, for little boats can surf when the bigger boats can't.\\" With this insight, Biehi hired Lee to build his next boat. Bill Lee built Witchcraft for Biehi, which launched in April, 1972. Witchcraft displaced 7,500 pounds and carried close to 600 square feet of sail area. Witchcraft also won the Mazatlan Race in 1972 and was credited with encouraging an evaluation of Transpac handicap ratings in 1973, which resulted in penalties for low displacement boats. Even so, Witchcraft's sister ship, Chutzpah, had won the 1973 Transpacific Yacht Race. Post Boat Building Bill Lee currently lives in Santa Cruz, California and sails regularly out of the Santa Cruz Yacht Harbor with the Santa Cruz Yacht Club. Bill works to connect boaters with yachts through his brokerage, Wizard Yachts, Ltd. located on the East side of the South Harbor in Santa Cruz, California. Boat Designs Mr. Lee's designs are noted for having been narrower and much lighter, often half the weight of competitors at times. His designs helped define the class of boat known as an ultra light displacement boat (ULDB), which tend to excel at surfing downwind with spinnakers in heavy breeze. These boats required fewer crew, made better use of scarce resources in their construction, and generally attracted highly skilled sailors with big-wave surfing backgrounds at breaks such as Steamer's Lane and Mavericks. Many folks had to get their hair cut before sailing on one of Lee's ULDBs since they went so fast their hair often got quite tussled. Mr Lee is also known for his boatyard on Hilltop Rd, Soquel, CA, known as \\"the Coop\\", as it was a chicken coop before Lee and his associates converted it into a boatyard. Santa Cruz 27 The Santa Cruz 27 was born by request in 1973 with the first customer asking, \\"\\"Quarter-tonner racing is really catching on here in Santa Barbara. I want a quarter tonner that is like WITCHCRAFT and CHUTZPAH only smaller.\\" After only two iterations, the first Santa Cruz 27, VANISHING POINT was finished and was a roaring success. Approximately 145 Santa Cruz 27s were built in Bill Lee's boat yard in Soquel, California. The Santa Cruz 27 is 27 feet long with 8 feet of beam, it carries a masthead rig with long J and short boom. The molds and right to produce Santa Cruz 27's were sold after boat #141 and again after #145. Santa Cruz 70 After a rule change from the Transpac Committee set a maximum IOR rating of 70.0 for the race (Merlin rated 70.5), Bill Lee modified the design of Merlin to create a boat which would rate exactly 70. First launched in 1985, nineteen Santa Cruz 70's were built. Merlin 68 MerlinS/V Merlin is an Ultra Light Displacement (ULDB) racing yacht constructed by famed yacht designer Bill Lee in 1977. At 68 x 12 ft. and 25,000 lbs., the vessel set multiple course records over its illustrious career. Merlin's unprecedented success on the racecourse includes winning the 1977 Transpacific Yacht Race, in which the vessel established a course record that stood for 20 years. The current owner is William F. ‚ÄúChip‚Äù Merlin, founder of Merlin Law Group. Merlin currently races and maintains the boat as part of his team, Merlin Yacht Racing.

He made the first recorded land purchase in what is now Maine, and proceeded to amass so much that he was called \\"the great landholder.\\" He possessed the largest number of acres of anyone who ever lived in Maine.Descendants of Edward Small Sullivan, Gov. James, The History of the District of Maine, I. Thomas and E. T. Andrews, Publishers, Boston, MA, 1795. Life and business Small was the only child of Edward Small and Elizabeth Shurtt of Bideford, Devonshire, England who is known to have remained in America.Descendants of Edward and Elizabeth SmallPalmer, Ansell W., ed. Piscataqua Pioneers: Selected Biographies of Early Settlers in Northern New England, p. 398, Piscataqua Pioneers, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, 2000. . There is no record of the other five children ever coming to the American Colonies. Francis is believed to have arrived in New England with his father about 1632. In 1648, he was residing in Dover, New Hampshire, and married Elizabeth Leighton of Kittery about 1650. While living in Casco (now Portland) in 1657, he bought from Scitterygusset, a local sagamore, about 200 acres (80.94 hectares) located on the northern side of Capisic Brook. In 1659, Small established a trading camp on Sebascodegan Island, now part of Harpswell. By 1668, he resided in Kittery, with a trading post (as a squatter) near the confluence of the Ossipee River and Saco River at what is now Cornish. Here major Indian trails converged‚Äîthe Sokokis Trail (now Route 5), the Ossipee Trail (now Route 25), and the Pequawket Trail (now Route 113) ‚Äì a location conducive towards lucrative fur trade with Indians, but also with risks of living isolated in the wilderness.History of Cornish, Maine Plot on his life Indeed, Chief Wesumbe (or Captain Sandy), the sagamore of the Newichewannock Abenaki tribe, warned Small of a planned attempt on his life by renegade tribesmen. They were indebted to the trader, having purchased goods in the spring on credit, to be paid in the fall with furs. Instead, they decided to erase the debt by killing him at early dawn on a certain day, setting fire to his house and shooting him when he ran out the door. At first Small thought the warning a trick to frighten him away and avoid payment. Just to be on the safe side, however, he took refuge on a nearby hill, from which he could peer through the pines and observe what might transpire. Sure enough, at first light his trading post went up in flames, illuminating the dark forest. Small began running and didn't stop until he reached Kittery. The Ossipee Tract As compensation for his losses, Chief Wesumbe sold to Small on November 28, 1668, twenty miles square of land, in all 256,000 acres (103,600 hectares), between the Ossipee River, Little Ossipee River, and Newichewannock River (now Salmon Falls River). The price was two large Indian blankets, two gallons of rum, two pounds of powder, four pounds of musket balls and twenty strings of Indian beads. The purchase comprised what is called the Ossipee Tract ‚Äì Limington, Limerick, Cornish (formerly named Francisborough after its early proprietor), Newfield, Parsonsfield and Shapleigh (part of which was later set off as Acton).\\"Who were Captain Sandy and Francis Small?\\" ‚Äì Francis Small Heritage Trust Small thereupon sold a half interest in the Ossipee Tract to Major Nicholas Shapleigh, who lived at what is now Eliot, and was then the richest man in the Piscataqua River region.History of Shapleigh, Maine But Indian unrest flared in 1675‚Äì1676 with King Philip's War. English settlements up the coast were attacked and burned until the revolt was quashed. About 1684, Small operated a trading post on Cape Small (which takes its name from him) at the extremity of what is today Phippsburg.History of Cape Small During King William's War, however, English settlements in the region were destroyed again in 1689 by Abenaki warriors allied with the forces of New France, which resented encroachment into territory it considered part of Acadia. The area was deserted. Small took part in the Ossipee Excursion in this war.General Society of Colonial Wars, An Index of Ancestors and Roll of Members of the Society of Colonial Wars, p. 432, New York, NY, 1922, (https://books.google.com/books?id=fpUvAAAAYAAJ&pg;=PA432&lpg;=PA432&dq;=%22ossipee+excursion%22+%22king+philip%27s+war%22&source;=bl&ots;=ah6iEfjav_&sig;=T45Fi6t_SMMYdNM1zcW_AkzHSms&hl;=en&ei;=FiRPTeLcNYnTgQfQ5YA_&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=1&ved;=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q;=%22ossipee%20excursion%22%20%22king%20philip%27s%20war%22&f;=false) Retrieved 6 Feb. 2011. About 1700, Small moved from Kittery to Truro, Massachusetts to live with his son, Daniel. Major Nicholas Shapleigh died in 1682, followed 32 years later by Small. Then in 1770, the original unrecorded deed from Wesumbe to Francis Small was found by Small's heirs. Together with the heirs of Shapleigh, in 1772 they appointed a committee to recover the land. Accompanied by a surveyor and chairman, the committee marked what became the towns' boundaries. Represented by attorney James Sullivan, Small's heirs took possession of Cornish, Limington, Newfield and half of Limerick, while Shapleigh's heirs took possession of Parsonsfield, Shapleigh and the remainder of Limerick, the latter town presented by both sets of heirs to Sullivan as his fee.

All money appropriated under the act was expended under the direction of the Secretary of War in accordance with the plans, specifications, and recommendations of the Mississippi River Commission as approved by the Chief of Engineers. It included surveys and estimates to determine the cost of protecting the Mississippi River basin from floods. It also provided for the salaries, clerical, office, traveling, and miscellaneous expenses of the Mississippi River Commission. Local interests protected thereby were to contribute not less than one-half of the cost of construction. At the completion of any levee building, the levees were to be locally maintained with the Federal Government retaining control. No money was to be expended for any right of way for any levee which may be constructed in cooperation with any State or levee district under authority of this Act, but all such rights of way shall be provided free of cost to the United States. Other watercourses connected with the Mississippi River could, in the discretion of the commission, also be improved. Upon the completion of any levee constructed for flood control under authority of this Act, said levee shall be turned over to the levee district protected thereby for maintenance thereafter; but for all other purposes the United States shall retain such control over the same as it may have the right to exercise upon such completion. The act also required comprehensive studies of the watersheds as to the extent and character of the area to be affected by the proposed improvement, the probable effect upon any navigable water or waterway, possible economical development and utilization of water power, and other uses properly related to or coordinated with the project.

He was son of Hezekiah and Sally (Hickman) Lincecum, and was born in Warren County, Georgia, on April 22, 1793. Lincecum was self-educated. He spent his boyhood principally in the company of Muskogees. After successive moves, he and his wife, the former Sarah Bryan, moved in 1818 with his parents and siblings to the Tombigbee River, above the site of present Columbus, Mississippi. While living among the Choctaw in Mississippi, he recorded their legends and traditions in the Choctaw language. After moving to Texas, he translated it to English as the Chahta Tradition. He sought a new frontier in 1868 and, at the age of seventy- six, with a widowed daughter and her seven children, joined a Confederate colony in Tuxpan, Veracruz, Mexico. He died on November 28, 1874 after a long illness at his Long Point, Texas, home. Historian Lincecum had contact with Chickasaw, Creek (Muscogee), and Choctaw Native Americans before the Indian Removals of the 1830s began. He learned how to speak and write their languages, learned about their medicine, and recorded their history. Lincecum frequently visited an elderly Choctaw man named Chahta Immataha, who gave him a detailed account of Choctaw oral history. Historian Patricia Galloway notes that Lincecum's \\"narrative is not reliable.\\" Naturalist Lincecum was a self-taught naturalist. Lincecum would spend \\"countless hours observing birds, insects, weather, rocks, and plants. He regularly corresponded with like- minded individuals, including Charles Darwin on two occasions. He published numerous articles in scholarly scientific journals and came to be recognized as a thorough and respectable researcher, in spite of his lack of formal education.\\" Works *‚ÄúAutobiography of Gideon Lincecum‚Äù, Publications of the Mississippi Historical Society. 8 (1905), 443-519. *‚ÄúChoctaw Traditions about Their Settlement in Mississippi and the Origin of Their Mounds.‚ÄùPublications of the Mississippi Historical Society. 8 (1904), 521-542. *‚ÄúLife of Apushimataha.‚Äù Publications of the Mississippi Historical Society. 9 (1906), 415-485. *\\"Pushmataha: A Choctaw Leader and His People.\\" Tuscaloosa, Alabama: University of Alabama Press, 2004. *Science on the Texas Frontier: Observations of Dr. Gideon Lincecum, Edited by Jerry Bryan Lincecum, Edward Hake Phillips, and Peggy A.

It is also known under its early title, Sonata for One Voice. History The piece was created in 1933 (the first and last movements composed on September 3 and 5, respectively) while Cage was studying music with Richard Buhlig (Nicholls 2002, 63). Buhlig convinced Cage to send the Sonata, as well as some other pieces, to Henry Cowell for publication in New Music; thus it became Cage's earliest published piece. Cowell later suggested that the Sonata be performed at a New Music Society of California workshop in San Francisco. When Cage arrived, it turned out the clarinetist couldn't play the piece, and Cage had to play it himself, on piano (Nicholls 1990, 176). Cage also tried to get a Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra clarinetist to play the sonata, but the clarinetist refused on aesthetic grounds (Kostelanetz 2003, 103). Later in life, Cage made some revisions and the sonata was finally published by Edition Peters, Cage's principal publisher, in 1963. Although he disliked some of his early works, he considered the Sonata, according to a late interview, \\"very interesting\\" (Duckworth 1999, 8). Analysis The Sonata is scored for a solo clarinet in B-flat. There are no dynamics, articulation or phrasing indications (Nicholls 1990, 176). Overall, the style is, in the words of Cage scholar James Pritchett, \\"chromatic, rhythmically complex, and unmetrical.\\" (Pritchett 1993, 7). There are three movements: #Vivace #Lento #Vivace The first movement is influenced by twelve-tone technique, but is not bound by its formal procedures: there is no row in the strict sense of the word, but the music is based on retrogrades of various melodic and rhythmic fragments. For example, the contents of bars 1‚Äì2 is presented in retrograde in bars 20‚Äì21, with the same rhythm, and similar symmetries and transformations inform the entire movement (Nicholls 2002, 64). By contrast, the second movement uses the tone row technique in a much more strict manner, although still only marginally related to Schoenberg's method. It begins with the various forms of the row following one another in close succession: prime (bars 1‚Äì5), transposed (bars 5‚Äì9), retrograde (bars 10‚Äì12). Bars 12‚Äì19 are filled with fragments from each of the three used forms, and the movement ends with the retrograde inversion (bars 20‚Äì24). The last notes repeat (pitch-wise) the ones from bar 5, where the prime form overlapped with the transposed form (Nicholls 2002, 63‚Äì64). The third movement is an exact pitch retrograde of the first. References * Duckworth, William.

Constructed in Maine  Belle Isle (AG 73) was laid down on 19 September 1944 at South Portland, Maine, by the New England Shipbuilding Corporation under a U.S. Maritime Commission contract (MCE hull 3070); launched on 3 November 1944; sponsored by Miss Sally Goding; transferred to the Navy on a loan basis on 15 November 1944; commissioned that same day for the voyage to the conversion yard, Lt. Comdr. James H.

World War II-related service  Belle Isle was assigned to Service Division (ServDiv) 104, Service Squadron (ServRon) 10, U.S. Pacific Fleet, and, by 7 October, was at Okinawa in the Ryukyu Islands making repairs for ships of the Pacific Fleet. She served at Okinawa until heading for Japan early in December. The ship arrived at Wakayama on 15 December and began repair duties for the occupation forces. That assignment lasted until she departed Japan on 31 March 1946 and headed back to the United States. Post-war decommissioning After making port at San Francisco, California, the electronics repair ship shifted south to San Diego, California, to prepare for inactivation. She was decommissioned on 30 August 1946 and berthed with the San Diego Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet. Temporary reactivation On 18 August 1951, while still in reserve, Belle Isle was reclassified a stores issue ship and redesignated AKS-211.  Final decommissioning She remained in reserve until 1960. On 1 April 1960, her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. Her disposal was approved on 3 August 1960, and she was apparently sunk as a target later that year. In November 1960, the ships in Destroyer Squadron 13 sank the Belle Isle off the coast of San Diego.

It is named after the church of St Michael the Archangel. Today it is owned by Belmond Ltd. and is operated as a luxury hotel. History Villa San Michele, Fiesole The original building was a monastery, founded in the early years of the 15th century for the Franciscan friars. The land on which it stood had been donated by a Florentine family, the Davanzatis, who also contributed to the monastery's upkeep by gifts of woodlands, further buildings and money The present building, with its fa√ßade attributed to Michelangelo and its imposing loggia, dates from 1600 when it was enlarged and completely renovated by Giovanni di Bartolomeo Davanzati. The monastery remained the property of the Franciscans until 1808 when the monastic orders were dissolved by Napoleon and, in 1817, it returned to secular use. By this time, many of its most treasured possessions had been dispersed throughout Florence's churches and art galleries. In 1900 the Villa was acquired by Henry White Cannon from New York City, who landscaped the gardens, erected large greenhouses and restored the building after the fashion of the Victorians, by adding wrought iron gates and by applying a rust-coloured patina to the walls. He also converted the courtyard into a winter garden by covering it with a roof of glass and iron. During World War II, the Villa was badly damaged and, in 1950, it was bought by Monsieur Lucien Tessier as a private residence He set about restoring the 20 first floor rooms, while living on the second floor, but the cost involved was substantial and to finance it, he turned the villa in to a hotel for those wanting to visit the nearby art treasures of Florence and the surrounding countryside. In 1982, Orient-Express Hotels, which already owned the Hotel Cipriani in Venice bought the Villa San Michele and the surrounding land. A comprehensive restoration of the buildings was embarked upon, this time with the cooperation of the Florence Fine Arts Authority. In 2014 the Villa San Michele was renamed the Belmond Villa San Michele when Orient-Express Hotels Ltd. changed its name to Belmond Ltd.

University Town Center, formerly New Town Center, is located in Hyattsville, Prince George's County, Maryland, United States. It was a planned urban center designed by Edward Durell Stone and located on a parcel at the intersection of Belcrest Road and East-West Highway and across from the then new Prince George's Plaza. The initial construction on this development took place in 1963-64; its buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A second phase commenced after the opening of the Prince George's Plaza station, Washington Metro rapid transit station in 1993. Development First phase The $78 million project was developed by Bancroft Construction, headed by Herschel and Marvin Blumberg who had originally purchased the site in 1954. The Blumberg brothers also developed the area of nearby Silver Spring, Maryland now known as the Rock Creek Woods Historic District. The original $5.5 million, Federal office building (now known as Metro 1) was occupied in 1963 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Architect Stone referred to the development as a \\"Rockefeller Center in the countryside.\\"\\"Urban Center Under Way in Prince George's County,\\" by John B. Willmann, Real Estate Editor, The Washington Post, Times Herald, June 6, 1964, p. E1. Other original buildings were the high rise apartments Plaza Towers West and Plaza Towers East, located at Toledo Terrace and Belcrest Road. The Metro 2 office building was completed in 1968 and the Metro 3 building in 1971. The original concept for the New Town Center was for it to be \\"a planned residential, commercial, employment and social complex which, as yet (1963) has no equal in the Baltimore-Washington area.\\" The Blumberg brothers' plans included interlocking residential and commercial facilities including the separation of pedestrian and automobile traffic and the enhancement of open spaces by the use of sunken reflecting pools, fountains, and plantings. Also included in the 1964 plans were two more Stone-designed office buildings (built in 1968 and 1972), another apartment structure (not built), a 1,400 seat motion picture theater (not built), and a huge ice skating rink (not built). Most dramatic were plans for multiple 34-story apartment towers, which would have been among the tallest structures in the Washington, DC area. Plans were also included for a Youth Center (built at Toledo and Adelphi Roads) and a $1.3 million Prince George's County Cultural Center (not built). Transportation plans in 1964 called for a spur from I-95 to be built just west of the tract (not built) and for underground rapid transit service to serve the Federal Building. Parks, schools, churches, and recreational facilities (some built) were expected to form a transitional buffer between the new developments and the surrounding single-family homes, in University Park, Maryland. New Town Center did not develop as fully or rapidly as originally envisioned. The expected I-95 extension through Northeast Washington and Maryland suburbs never occurred, effectively isolating the area. Development of the Washington Metro did not occur until the 1970s and the Green Line was the last segment developed in the main system. Finally, the changing demographic characteristics of Prince George's County to majority-minority during the 1980s and 1990s soured the area to many developers. Second phase However, interest in this area revived following the opening of the Prince George's Plaza Metro station in 1993. Still owned and controlled by Herschel Blumberg and renamed Prince George's Metro Center, the development was later renamed University Town Center when the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) in 2000 decided to lease new headquarters space at the site.\\"Back to the Future,\\" by Douglas Fruehling, On Site, Summer 2007, pp. 25-27. NCHS had previously been a tenant in one of the original office buildings and moved to its new headquarters in 2002 in the building named Metro Four. In August 2006, a 16-story student apartment with 910 beds opened at the site providing housing for students from 11 local colleges and universities. In 2007, a new main street dubbed America Boulevard opened, as did a 14-screen Regal movie theater complex, a variety of dining options, and two condominium buildings.\\"A Place for Students To Study in Style; Luxury High-Rise Caters to Collegians,\\" by Ruben Castaneda, The Washington Post, Jul 19, 2008, p. T-5. Also located at University Town Center is a satellite campus of Prince George's Community College. A Safeway supermarket, with space for additional retail outlets, opened at University Town Center on April 6, 2016. The development that restarted in the 2000s has been dubbed \\"the realization of a half-century old dream to counter the patterns of suburban sprawl.\\" References Buildings and structures in Prince George's County, Maryland Planned communities in the United States Hyattsville, Maryland Transit-oriented developments in the United States Edward Durell Stone buildings Commercial buildings completed in 1964 Modernist architecture in Maryland National Register of Historic Places in Prince George's County, Maryland ","title":"University Town Center"},{"id":"18810397","title":"Landmark Records"},{"id":"18810410","text":"Lavendula may refer to: *Lavendula, grandsire of My Babu *Lavendula, Houston based band, which included Arthur Yoria *Streptomyces lavendulae, produces cycloserine, a broad-spectrum antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis *Lavandula, the Lavender genus of flowering plants ","title":"Lavendula"},{"id":"18810418","text":"The Quoeech were a Native American group who lived in southern Nevada.

The revolutionists are imploring their leader to let them stop singing in the sun, or at least to resume singing in the shade. And while the captain starts the singing in a voice rougher than a grinding shale, orangeade all around would not be amiss. The poem reflects Stevens's affection for the Caribbean, and it is as light as a feather compared to other poems added to the 1931 edition of Harmonium, like \\"Sea Surface full of Clouds\\".

(b. Lusigny-sur-Ouche, Burgundy, 12 June 1711, d. at Issy, √éle-de-France, 21 July 1780) was a French Sulpician priest and theologian, and a Doctor of the Sorbonne. Life After studying philosophy and theology at the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice, Paris, Legrand taught philosophy at Clermont, 1733‚Äì1736, and then resumed his studies in Paris, where he entered the Society of Saint-Sulpice in 1739 and obtained the licentiate in 1740. He taught theology at Cambrai, 1740‚Äì1743, was superior of the seminary in Autun, 1743‚Äì1745, and, having been recalled to Paris, received the degree of Doctor of Theology from the Sorbonne in 1746. Henceforth he remained at the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice in various employments. Appointed director of studies in 1767 he exercised in this capacity an influence over young seminarians of France, who were preparing to take their degrees at the Sorbonne. As a Doctor of the Sorbonne he was called upon to take a prominent part in framing the decisions and censures of the theological faculty; in that intense period of opposition to Christian dogma, he was centrally involved in its defense. Works It was Legrand who wrote the condemnation of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Emile, or On Education (reprinted in Migne's Theologiae Cursus Completus, II, col. 1111-1248). Legrand also drafted the censures of Marmontel's B√©lisaire and Isaac-Joseph Berruyer's Histoire du Peuple de Dieu. He helped to avert a censure of Buffon's Epoques de la Nature, in consideration of the author's retraction. Legrand's moderation and kindliness gained the esteem and good will of both Buffon and Marmontel. Most of what Legrand wrote was in collaboration. Nearly all the writings of Legrand were included by Migne in his Theologiae Cursus Completus. The most important are: *Praelectiones Theologicae de Deo ac divinis attributis, a work by La Fosse based on Tourn√©ly's treatise, re-edited by Legrand who added about 400 pages of additional matter. Reprinted in Migne, VII. *Tractatus de Incarnatione Verbi Divini (in Migne, IX), also based on Tourn√©ly. Parts of Legrand's Tractatus de Ecclesia have been reproduced by Migne in his Scripturae Sacrae Cursus Completus, IV. At the time of his death, Legrand left an unfinished treatise, De Existentia Dei (Paris, 1812).

DTP competitors Ready,Set,Go! and Aldus PageMaker were introduced in 1985 when Apple delivered the 512K Macintosh. MacPublisher was developed by Bob Doyle and distributed by Boston Software Publishers. Built on graphics primitives like QuickDraw that Bill Atkinson had originally developed for the Apple Lisa computer, MacPublisher included WYSIWYG layout for multi-column text and graphics. QuickDraw was incorporated in the Pascal toolbox for the new Macintosh and had been the basis for MacPaint. The Desktop Publishing industry exploded in the year 1985 with the introduction of the Apple LaserWriter printer in January and in July the 512K \\"Fat Mac\\" and Aldus Corporation's PageMaker, which rapidly became the DTP industry standard software. It was Paul Brainerd, Aldus' chairman, who gave the industry the name \\"desktop publishing.\\" MacPublisher had been called \\"electronic publishing,\\" after the industry then led by Atex Corporation, of which Brainerd had been a vice president. MacPublisher was the first non-Apple application program to print in color on the ImageWriter II. It introduced spot color to desktop publishing. MacPublisher III was the first DTP program to rotate text and graphics, using a table look-up for the necessary sine functions in one-degree increments. MacPublisher builds a page differently from PageMaker and ReadySetGo do; instead of creating an actual image of the page with all the text and graphics, MacPublisher created a page mockup that contains only rectangles that represent the location and size of text and graphic elements, and stored the elements as special text and picture files that you edit separately from the page layout. MacPublisher rebuilds a page whenever it changes. The company says it took this approach to allow creation of master pages, repeating elements, and predefined \\"canned\\" page layouts; to help prevent data loss on machines with limited memory (MacPublisher can run with as little as 128K RAM); and to facilitate the programming for the automatic table of contents and automatic page jump (\\"continued on page x\\") features. Since the page layout is independent of the text and graphic content, you can easily create publication formats you can reuse as you need them. This reusable formats feature can be especially useful for creating catalogs or other publications in which you want the format to remain the same but in which you need to update or replace information on a regular basis. MacPublisher features either automatic or manual kerning to correct printer spacing idiosyncrasies.Desktop Publishing, by Frederic E. Davis, John Barry, and Michael Wiesenberg, Dow Jones Irwin, 1986, p.98 MacPublisher included unusual desktop accessories such as a scissor tool to cut columns of text and paste the remainder into another page, a camera tool for capturing graphics from MacPaint, and a see-through ruler that could be moved around the page for measurements.Desktop Publishing from A to Z, by Bill Grout, Irene Athanasopolous, and Rebecca Kutlin, Osborne/McGraw-Hill, 1986, p.140 MacPublisher was sold in 1986 to Esselte Letraset, whose business in press- down dry transfer lettering was evaporating with competition from laser printers, notably Apple's pioneering LaserWriter printer. It was briefly sold as LetraPage, but dropped from the market when Letraset subsequently acquired Ready,Set,Go! from Manhattan Graphics.

Education  Burke obtained a Bachelor's Degree in archaeology from the University of New England in 1987, and a PhD from the same university in 1997. Her doctoral thesis investigated the expression of ideology through architectural style in the city of Armidale, New South Wales, during the period 1830‚Äì1930. It was published in 1999 as Meaning and Ideology in Historical Archaeology.  Career  After completing her PhD, Burke worked in consulting archaeology, having previously taught briefly at the University of New England. She was subsequently employed within the archaeology program at Flinders University, where she is currently a professor. From 2011 to 2015, she was the co-editor of the journal Australian Archaeology. Burke has called for improving graduate programs in archaeology to better prepare students for positions outside of academic research. Together with Claire Smith, in 2004 she published the first edition of The Archaeologist's Field Handbook, a standard manual for teaching archaeological field methods, which was revised and expanded for a second edition in 2017 (the latter published with Dr Michael Morrison). Burke's current research focuses primarily on processes of contact and colonialism on the Australian frontier. She is a chief investigator of the ARC-funded project \\"Archaeology of the Native Mounted Police\\", which is investigating the experience of life in the Queensland NMP, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal memories of the NMP, and the institution's history and development. She is also part of the team (which includes the Western Cape Communities Central Sub-Regional Trust (Weipa) and the Queensland Museum) studying Indigenous foodways in the Cape York Peninsula, far north Queensland.

At the 2001 World Weightlifting Championships in Antalya, Turkey she won gold in the 53 kg category in the clean and jerk, bronze in the snatch, and the overall bronze medal with in total 205 kg. She ranked 7th in the Woman's 58 kg category at the 2004 Summer Olympics, lifting 215 kg in total. At the 2006 World Weightlifting Championships she ranked 16th in the 58 kg category, and at the 2007 World Weightlifting Championships she ranked 5th in the same category, lifting a total of 220 kg. Escobar won the gold medal in the 58 kg category at the 2008 Pan American Weightlifting Championships. She competed in Weightlifting at the 2008 Summer Olympics ‚Äì Women's 58 kg in Beijing, ranking 5th with 223 kg in total, and also was the national flag bearer at the opening ceremony. She was the Ecuadorian flag-bearer for both the 2004 and 2008 Olympic games. In the 2012 Summer Olympics, she again competed in the women's 58 kg category, finishing 9th with a total of 226 kg. She was born on July 14, 1980, in the coastal city Esmeraldas. Early life Escobar's parents struggled to support her, and soon sent her to be raised by her aunt Luisa Marquez. It was Luisa's daughter, Adela Marquez, who introduced Escobar to the sport of weightlifting. From an early age Escobar knew that sports would likely present the best opportunity to escape the poverty she had inherited at birth. Escobar was found by a local coach in Esmeraldas named Silvio Mila. Mila practically refused to let Escobar walk away from the sport, and just four months after beginning to train in the sport she won her first medal, and was shortly thereafter invited to join the Ecuadorian Weightlifting team. Escobar first found international success in 2001 at the World Championships in Antalya, Turkey where she won a gold medal in the 53 kg Clean & Jerk event. Escobar has also found considerable success on her home continent winning 18 gold medals in various major South American competitions. She has competed in three Olympic Games all in the 58 kg event, and is currently working towards qualifying for the 2016 games to be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Escobar and her husband Dario Xavier Garcia have one son, Dominic Ramses Garcia. She is currently coached by the Cuban Javier Perez Rosas, and trains in her home town of Esmeraldas. The government has provided her with facilities to train in and a monthly stipend to allow her to focus solely on weightlifting. Pan American Championships While Alexandra Escobar has competed in three Olympic Games and several World Championships her greatest success has undoubtedly came at the Pan American Championships. She first appeared on the Pan American stage in 2008 at the games held in Callao, Peru when she swept the 58 kg events, winning three gold medals 1 each in the 58 kg, the 58 kg ‚Äì snatch and the 58 kg ‚Äì clean & jerk. Since the 2008 games in Callao Escobar has won 10 gold medals, 2 silvers and 1 bronze. Making that even more impressive, she won back to back to back gold medals in both the 58 kg and the 58 kg ‚Äì clean & jerk during the 2008, 2009 and 2010 games. Escobar is showing no signs of slowing down either having recently won gold medals in 58 kg, the 58 kg ‚Äì snatch and the 58 kg ‚Äì clean & jerk events at the 2013 games held in Caracas, Venezuela. Olympic Games Alexandra Escobar's dream is to win an Olympic medal, and she has competed in three games so far. She first competed in the Olympics in 2004 at Athens, Greece. She then returned in the 2008 games at Beijing, China. Finally, she competed in London, England during the 2012 games. Prior to the 2012 games Escobar said: Unfortunately, Escobar has yet to accomplish this goal as her best finish so far was fourth place in the 2008 games. In the opening ceremony of those games Escobar was the flag bearer for her home country Ecuador. Escobar considers this a great honor that was bestowed upon her. Her other finishes in the Olympics were 7th place in 2004 and 9th in 2012. After the disappointing finish in London there was some speculation that Escobar would retire as she has spoken about an interest in coaching and studying sports science. However this soon proved false as she has returned to competitions in 2013. World championships Alexandra Escobar has competed in eight World Championships. She has won one gold medal, in 2001, and has finished second on two occasions, both occurring in the 2013 games held in Wroclaw, Poland. She has also won four bronze medals, in 2001, 2003 and 2013. Her medals have all came in the 58 kg, 58 kg ‚Äì snatch and 58 kg ‚Äì clean & jerk events. Controversy In October 2003 Escobar threatened to boycott the World Championships that were being held in Vancouver, Canada later that year unless the governing committee canceled a twenty thousand dollar fine that was imposed on a fellow competitor. Ultimately, the issue was resolved and Escobar attended the games winning a bronze medal in the 58 kg ‚Äì snatch event. This event painted Escobar as a martyr in the eyes of the weightlifting community, and garnered her significant respect among her fellow competitors.

He is also vice secretary-general of the UNESCO China-MAB (Man and the Biosphere) Committee and a member of the UNESCO MAB Urban Group. He is known for his concepts of ‚Äúurban vegetation\\" and allowing damaged ecosystems to recover naturally.  Career  Jiang received his bachelor's degree in Botany at Shandong University in 1985 , and his master's degree in Botany at the Institute of Botany Academia Sinica in 1988 . He received his Phd in Botany in 1993. He studied at the University of Liverpool from 1991 to 1992. Jiang has done research on a wealth of topics. These topics include eco-environmental planning for middle-sized cities in China, bioindicating and biomonitoring of air pollution by plants, phosphorus cycling and chemical ecology, the ecology of colliery spoils, and urban vegetation. He initiated the first conference for the Young Chinese Botanists in Beijing 1987, and the first conference on Environment and Plant Resource Exploring in China in Changbaishan in 1988. Jiang was the first person to chart the pollution history of Chengde in northern China. He was the first to explain why ancient pine trees in gardens were dying. He has also established models for monitoring sulfur dioxide (SO2) pollution in woody plants. Jiang noted the effects of tourism and urbanization on the Chengde Mountain Resort (also known as the Summer Villa estate), which is the largest existing imperial garden in China. Jiang Gaoming is married to Jianjie Lu. They have a daughter.  Works  Jiang has published hundreds of articles, papers, and books, a majority of which are in Chinese. His main topics include plant ecology and plant ecophysiology. He publishes articles for chinadialogue, which are available in Chinese and English. * Fixing the food chain chinadialogue 28 June 2010 * Beware the GM giants chinadialogue 18 January 2010 * Removing chemicals from our food chinadialogue 14 August 2009 * Towards a new energy economy chinadialogue 11 June 2009 * Ensuring food security in China chinadialogue 27 March 2009 * Storing carbon in the fields chinadialogue 25 February 2009 * The high price of developing dams chinadialogue 22 January 2009 * Consumers must say no to additives chinadialogue 26 September 2009 * Cutting emissions in rural China chinadialogue 12 November 2008 * Rush of energy chinadialogue 3 September 2008 * China's evaporating wetlands chinadialogue 28 August 2008 * Letting nature heal itself chinadialogue 18 July 2008 * The countryside is being forgotten chinadialogue 12 June 2008 * To everything there is a season chinadialogue 22 May 2008 * Saving Beijing‚Äôs reservoirs chinadialogue 23 April 2008 * Land reclamation: tread carefully chinadialogue 11 March 2008 * Chinese consumers must reject polluted food chinadialogue 5 February 2008 * China‚Äôs ‚Äúgreen deserts‚Äù chinadialogue 8 January 2008 * Waiting for the smoke to clear chinadialogue 17 October 2007 * The problem with cotton chinadialogue 12 September 2007 * Securing our food ‚Äî and our future chinadialogue 16 August 2007 * The disappearing sand of Yimengshan chinadialogue 7 August 2007 * The truth about dead chickens chinadialogue 14 June 2007 * A sea of plastic chinadialogue 16 May 2007 * Stopping the sandstorms chinadialogue 13 April 2007 * Global warming‚Äôs local solutions chinadialogue 15 March 2007 * China must say no to imported waste chinadialogue 8 February 2007 * The new Green Revolution chinadialogue 17 January 2007  Positions  * Invasive Species In July Jiang asked the government to watch out for invasive species, especially during the Olympic games. He noted that international meetings are often bothered by invasive species. This could cause biological catastrophes and incur major economic losses. For example, the State Forestry Bureau said last year that there were more than 290 alien species on the mainland, causing estimated losses of 56 billion yuan (HK$63.79 billion) a year. * Desertification Jiang is eager to control desertification but he criticizes the government's policy of planting one species of trees. \\"Ecology is on everyone's lips, but ecology does not mean blindly planting trees,\\" Xinhua News Agency reported Jiang as saying. Jiang thinks the main cause of desertification in Inner Mongolia is overgrazing. By 2000 some 80% of the grasslands in Hunshandake had deteriorated into desert, and 33% of the land had become mobile sand dunes. In the 1960s mobile sand dunes only made up 2% of the land.[sina] The first attempt to solve desertification involved planting 100,000 yuan (13,000 U.S. dollars) worth of willows, because conventional thought led Jiang to believe trees were the best solution to stop sandstorms. Later Jiang's team tried a different approach. A 2670-hectare (26.7 km¬≤) section of grassland in the Bayinhushuo Gacha was fenced off and no grazing was allowed. The success achieved in Bayinhushuo Gacha quickly spread to the surrounding regions: several gachas followed suit, fencing off grasslands for natural restoration and thereby expanding the protected areas to more than 6500 hectares. Jiang is pleased that a policy of \\"ecological conservation first, ecological construction second\\" was included in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan on Ecological Protection. * Biofuels Jiang supports burning straw instead of coal as a source of power. He estimated that a biomass power plant of 25,000 kW can generate 100,000 tons less carbon dioxide every year compared with the coal burning power plant of the same capacity. Furthermore, Jiang said that biomasses are less wasteful than coal. Thirty percent of burnt coal is waste while biomass burning generates just two percent and can be used as fertilizer after proper processing. * Pesticides Jiang believes that the use of pesticides in Chinese farming can lead to poor quality and even dangerous food. ‚ÄúFarmers adopted certain production methods to make food-production cheaper. They use whichever chemicals are cheapest. The use of pesticide seems better, and it is cheap. In fact, the pesticides they would buy are also used as fertiliser, and this makes it all the more dangerous,‚Äù Jiang said.

The company was set up in 1967, and in 12 years grew to be the largest non- Government data processing organisation in the Southern Hemisphere, servicing more than 1,200 banking offices.Computing a Nation by Databank Systems Limited (c1988, 16-page booklet) Purpose The purpose of Databank was defined within a set of contractual obligations in the 1969 Processing Agreement. The Agreement was between the consortium members, and was essentially about the services and service levels to be provided by Databank, and the constraints that would exist to ensure that lead bank ownership of any new application/system, and bank competitiveness, were maintained. History The formation of Databank came at a time when computer systems were a scarce and expensive commodity in New Zealand, with the import of computers being restricted by the Second National Government (a conservative but highly regulatory government). Computers (like many items) could only be imported under licence. The executive management of the BNZ (Bank of New Zealand) wanted to obtain a computer and establish a computerised system to enable the automation of the processing of its banking transactions and customer accounting. Computerisation was deemed as the only way to proceed if the increasing cheque transaction volumes were to be accommodated in timely fashion. The other, smaller banks were approaching the point where they would face a similar situation. However, the NBNZ (National Bank of New Zealand) was the only one that happened to have a computer import licence. Thus, the initial teaming-up was between the BNZ and NBNZ in 1966, and they set up Databank in 1967. The three other trading banks subsequently joined the consortium in 1968. Decimal currency was introduced in New Zealand on 10 July 1967. Incorporation Databank was incorporated in 1967 in Wellington, New Zealand, to deliver services to the then statutorily mandated trading banks of New Zealand. The founding CEO was Gordon Hogg (1930‚Äì2017); from the BNZ and known as the \\"bright brain\\" there. Ian Archibald was hired from the Bank of Scotland and worked closely with Gordon Hogg. Gordon worked well with Ian who was much more cautious. Gordon stayed at the company until he was obliged by the Databank Board to take early retirement in 1988. The consortium of shareholder-customers of Databank had ownership distributed thus: * BNZ ‚Äì Bank of New Zealand (a state-owned bank at the time) ‚Äì 40% share of Databank. * NBNZ ‚Äì National Bank of New Zealand (a subsidiary of Lloyds Bank, UK) ‚Äì 20% share of Databank. * ANZ ‚Äì Australia-New Zealand Bank (an Australian-owned bank) ‚Äì 20% share of Databank. * BNSW ‚Äì Bank of New South Wales (an Australian-owned bank) ‚Äì 10% share of Databank. * CBA ‚Äì Commercial Bank of Australia (an Australian-owned bank) ‚Äì 10% share of Databank. By 1984, the consortium ownership of Databank had changed due to the merger of BNSW and CBA banks, thus: * BNZ ‚Äì Bank of New Zealand (a state-owned bank at the time) ‚Äì 40% share of Databank. * NBNZ ‚Äì National Bank of New Zealand (a subsidiary of Lloyds Bank, UK) ‚Äì 20% share of Databank. * ANZ ‚Äì Australia-New Zealand Bank (an Australian-owned bank) ‚Äì 20% share of Databank. * WBC ‚Äì Westpac Banking Corporation (an Australian-owned bank) ‚Äì 20% share of Databank.  Operation  A national computerised network was set up with overnight processing of transactions, initially on IBM System/360 Model 40 computers. Money Transfer Services (MTS) were introduced in February 1969, and all branches of the trading banks were converted to computer processing by November 1969. In 1974/75 chequing accounts were introduced by the Post Office Savings Bank and several trustee savings banks. Computing a Nation The Fourth Labour Government elected in 1984 commenced a comprehensive restructuring of the New Zealand economy, including banking deregulation. Since Databank essentially owned the New Zealand payments system, which was operated through and by Databank, the existing clearing systems had to be opened up to new banks entering the market, to provide what was referred to as a \\"level playing field\\". By 1988, Databank had become an increasingly large operational cost for the banks, who questioned whether they were continuing to receive value for money. A 1989 legal decision, that inter-company transactions (i.e., between Databank and the consortium members) must carry Goods and Services TaxC of IR v. Databank Systems Ltd., (1989) 11 NZTC 6,093 meant that the long-term cost-effectiveness of Databank was no longer likely, and that it had become a financial risk. The decision was thus eventually taken by the banks to split off the core and common payments system processing of Databank and put it under the ownership of a new all-bank forum called ISL (Interchange and Settlement Ltd), and plans were put in place to dismantle Databank and sell it. Sale and Closure Between 1992 and 1994, all major development of new banking systems by Databank was aborted, the development projects were closed down and the associated personnel were retrenched. This was managed by the then CEO, Tony Hood, who had formerly been a Commercial Services Manager at Databank, and later the Chief Manager of IT at the Westpac Bank. He was appointed as CEO by the Board of Databank, and assigned the task of disposing of the company. In 1994, Databank was sold to the US company Electronic Data Systems Corporation (EDS) ‚Äì a General Motors Corporation subsidiary ‚Äì for an undisclosed price. Tony Hood became the EDS CEO, resigning from EDS in 1996. The Databank subsidiary, Databank Investments Ltd, was part of the job lot. At the time, Databank employed about 950 people. EDS' acquisition of Databank was intended to give it a base for further expansion, either by further takeovers or by selling services in the region. A Commerce Commission report on the sale stated: \\"The proposed acquisition of Databank Systems Ltd is in line with Electronic Data Systems Corporation‚Äôs strategic plan for the Asia/Pacific area and will result in the establishment of a significant banking services organisation based in New Zealand. The Commission is advised there are plans to offer information technology services to non-banking customers as well.\\" About 25% of Databank‚Äôs turnover at the time was via its Commercial Services arm, to customers other than its four former owners.

The majority of his appearances were for Oxford University and Worcestershire, although he appeared for the Gentlemen in both 1936 and 1937 (only the latter game being played at Lord's) and for an England XI in 1937. Unusually, he alternated somewhat between keeping wicket and bowling, although his success with the ball was limited. Aged 18, Kimpton made his first-class debut for Oxford against his future county, Worcestershire, at The Parks in early May 1935, a game which the university won by an innings. Kimpton showed his versatility by scoring 38, bowling five (admittedly wicketless) overs and claiming a catch and a stumping (even though Norman Knight was Oxford's named keeper). In his second match, Kimpton made what was to remain his career best innings when he hit 160 versus Gloucestershire; these runs were hit in 155 minutes, and included a whirlwind hour in which he added 138 with Sandy Singleton. His seven further games for Oxford that summer were relatively uneventful. In early May 1936 Kimpton again punished Gloucestershire, scoring a century in each innings. Later that same month he hit a second-innings 102 (from number eight) in 70 minutes ‚Äì despite needing a runner ‚Äî against Lancashire, then followed that up with 110 not out and 85 against Free Foresters; in the latter game he also took a career best 4‚Äì42. He was picked for the Gentlemen v Players game at Folkestone at the end of the summer, and scored 115. Kimpton's hundred against Lancashire had put him on course for that season's Walter Lawrence Trophy, but Leslie Ames pipped him to the title by two minutes in the very last match of the year. 1937 saw Kimpton make his debut in county cricket, although he continued to turn out for Oxford. He had by some distance his most productive season, scoring 1,568 runs in all first-class cricket at an average of 34.84, although despite a dozen innings between 50 and 99 he only managed one century. This, the only three-figure score he ever made for Worcestershire, came against Derbyshire in late August. In July he made his second appearance for the Gentlemen, this time at Lord's, and struck 59 in the first innings, while at the end of the summer he represented an England XI against the New Zealanders at Folkestone. Kimpton played ten games in 1938, including two on the joint Oxford and Cambridge Universities tour of Jamaica in August, but found little success, making only two half-centuries and averaging under 24. He played no cricket in 1939, and with the outbreak of the Second World War he returned to Australia to join the RAAF as a fighter pilot. In this role he won the DFC, the citation noting his \\"aggressive and determined leadership\\" during 140 sorties over the Pacific Ocean. After the war Kimpton played little, being largely occupied with the family business in Melbourne, but he did make three further first- class appearances. There was a one-off game for Worcestershire in 1949, in which he showed his continuing ability by taking 93* off Nottinghamshire; and in 1955-56 he accepted an invitation from E. W. Swanton to join his tour to the West Indies, playing his final two matches at the age of 39. As well as cricket, Kimpton was an accomplished tennis player, winning the freshmen's tournament; he also achieved a blue at golf. His brother Stephen played four matches for Oxford University in 1935, appearing alongside Roger in two of them.

Electrical brain stimulation (EBS), also referred to as focal brain stimulation (FBS), is a form of electrotherapy and technique used in research and clinical neurobiology to stimulate a neuron or neural network in the brain through the direct or indirect excitation of its cell membrane by using an electric current. It is used for research or for therapeutic purposes.  History  Electrical brain stimulation was first used in the first half of the 19th century by pioneering researchers such as Luigi Rolando (1773‚Äì1831) and Pierre Flourens (1794‚Äì1867), to study the brain localization of function, following the discovery by Italian physician Luigi Galvani (1737‚Äì1798) that nerves and muscles were electrically excitable. The stimulation of the surface of the cerebral cortex by using brain stimulation was used to investigate the motor cortex in animals by researchers such as Eduard Hitzig (1838‚Äì1907), Gustav Fritsch (1838‚Äì1927), David Ferrier (1842‚Äì1928) and Friedrich Goltz (1834‚Äì1902). The human cortex was also stimulated electrically by neurosurgeons and neurologists such as Robert Bartholow (1831‚Äì1904) and Fedor Krause (1857‚Äì1937). In the following century, the technique was improved by the invention of the stereotactic method by British neurosurgeon pioneer Victor Horsley (1857‚Äì1916), and by the development of chronic electrode implants by Swiss neurophysiologist Walter Rudolf Hess (1881‚Äì1973), Jos√© Delgado (1915‚Äì2011) and others, by using electrodes manufactured by straight insulated wire that could be inserted deep into the brain of freely-behaving animals, such as cats and monkeys. This approach was used by Dr.James Olds (1922‚Äì1976) and colleagues to discover brain stimulation reward and the pleasure center. American-Canadian neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield (1891‚Äì1976) and colleagues at the Montreal Neurological Institute used extensive electrical stimulation of the brain cortex in awake neurosurgical patients to investigate the motor and sensory homunculus (the representation of the body in the brain cortex according to the distribution of motor and sensory territories). EBS remains inextricably entwined with the work of Dr. Robert Galbraith Heath, Dr. Jose Delgado and Dr. Wilder Penfield. It's of interest that during cerebral localization studies, neurosurgeon Penfield could not elicit emotional reactions in humans, either by observing spontaneous epilepsy or by electrically stimulating the surface of the cerebral cortex. Neurophysiologist Dr. Jose Delgado noted a few exceptions to this rule. In contrast, EBS, via deeply implanted electrodes in localized areas of the brain (deep brain stimulation; DBS), elicited both pleasurable and aversive responses in laboratory animals and humans as previously described. EBS could elicit the ritualistic, motor responses of sham rage in cats by stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus, as well as more complex emotional and behavioral components of \\"true rage\\" in both experimental animals by stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus, and in human subjects by stimulating various deep areas of the brain. EBS in human patients with epilepsy could trigger seizures in the surface of the brain and pathologic aggression and rage with stimulation of the amygdala.  Process  Two-photon excitation microscopy has shown that microstimulation activates neurons sparsely around the electrode even at low currents (as low as 10 ŒºA) up to distances as far as four millimeters away. This happens without particularly selecting other neurons much nearer the electrode's tip. This is due to activation of neurons being determined by whether they do or do not have axons or dendrites that pass within a radius of 15 Œºm near the tip of the electrode. As the current is increased the volume around the tip that activates neuron axons and dendrites increases and with this the number of neurons activated. Activation is most likely to be due to direct depolarization rather than synaptic activation. Effects A comprehensive review of EBS research compiled a list of many different acute impacts of stimulation depending on the brain region targeted. Following are some examples of the effects documented: * Sensory: Feelings of body tingling, swaying, movement, suffocation, burning, shock, warmth, paresthesia, feeling of falling, oscillopsia, dysesthesia, levitation, sounds, phosphenes, hallucinations, micropsia, diplopia, etc. * Motor: Eye movements, locomotion, speech arrest, automatisms, laughter, palilalia, chewing, urge to move, crying without feeling sad, etc. * Autonomic: Blushing, mydriasis, change in blood pressure and breathing, apnea, nausea, tachycardia, sweating, etc. * Emotional: Anxiety, mirth, feeling of unreality, fear, happiness, anger, sadness, transient acute depression, hypomania, etc. * Cognitive: Acalculia, paraphasia, anomic aphasia, recalling memories, \\"going into a trance\\", \\"out of this world\\", conduction aphasia, hemispatial neglect, alexia, d√©j√† vu, reliving past experiences, agraphia, apraxia, etc. EBS in face-sensitive regions of the fusiform gyrus caused a patient to report that the faces of the people in the room with him had \\"metamorphosed\\" and became distorted: \\"Your nose got saggy, went to the left. [...] Only your face changed, everything else was the same.\\"  Therapeutic applications  Stereotactic apparatus used to insert an electrode into the basal ganglia of the brain, for Parkinson's disease surgery. Examples of therapeutic EBS are: * Cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) * Deep brain stimulation (DBS) * Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) * Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) * Low Field Magnetic Stimulation (LFMS) * Functional electrical stimulation (FES) * Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) * Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) * Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (Deep TMS) * Responsive nerve stimulation (RNS) Strong electric currents may cause a localized lesion in the nervous tissue, instead of a functional reversible stimulation. This property has been used for neurosurgical procedures in a variety of treatments, such as for Parkinson's disease, focal epilepsy and psychosurgery. Sometimes the same electrode is used to probe the brain for finding defective functions, before passing the lesioning current (electrocoagulation).

The film was part of the \\"World Cinema Documentary Competition\\" at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. Plot Filmmaker Chris Waitt sets out on a quest to find out why his romantic relationships have ended in complete failure. Tracking down almost all of his former lovers, he finds a general resentment, stemming from his constant unreliability. He then sets out to test different approaches that will prepare him for true love, and a lasting relationship. Reception Reviews of the film were mixed, with Rotten Tomatoes giving the film 56%.http://beta.rottentomatoes.com/m/complete_history_of_my_sexual_failures/ Dennis Harvey, writing for Variety, was generally positive, and commended Waitt for his willingness \\"to appear a complete (though endearing) ass\\", while suspecting he was not quite as dumb as he appeared. The Independent, The Independent On Sunday, The Times, The Financial Times and The Sun all gave the movie four stars. The Daily Telegraph's Mike McCahill, doubting the veracity of Waitt's story, concluded that \\"It's a display of gross bad faith both as documentarist and lover, and its subject probably deserves never to get laid again.\\" On the other hand, Toby Young writing in The Independent, despite thinking that \\"If Waitt was an employee of the BBC he'd be dragged before a series of committees before being tossed into the street\\" nonetheless concluded that \\"this doesn't matter at all\\" as the film was \\"so funny I thought I would pass out\\".

The Shivwits Paiutes settled in Utah around 1100 BC. They hunted rabbits, deer, and mountain sheep and gathered seeds, roots, tubers, berries, and nuts, particularly pine nuts. They were farmers living along the Santa Clara River and the Virgin River and cultivated crops of corn, squash, melons, gourds, sunflowers, and, after European contact, winter wheat.\\"Shivwits Band of Paiutes.\\" Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah. 2009 (retrieved 7 Dec 2009) The Dom√≠nguez‚ÄìEscalante expedition of 1776 was most likely the Shivwits' first contact with Europeans. Fur trader Jedediah Smith created a route to California directly through Paiute territory. The 19th century brought non-Native trappers, traders, and settlers to the area. The newly introduced livestock had a negative effect on the area's delicate ecology. Utes and Navajos often captured Paiute women and children and sold them to European-Americans as slaves. Mormons permanently settled on Paiute lands in the 1850s, putting an end to the Shivwits' traditional lifestyle. Their reservation was formed in 1891. It did not receive water rights so they were forced to abandon farming.\\"U.S. accord gives water to Shivwits.\\" Deseret News. 20 Nov 2003 (retrieved 31 Oct 2012) The reservation had a population of 194 in that year. There were 154 Shivwits in 1906.\\"Paiute Indian Tribe History.\\" Access Genealogy. (retrieved 7 Dec 2009) The Shivwits Band of Paiute Indians of Utah first received federal recognition on March 3, 1891 as the \\"Shebit tribe of Indians in Washington County, Utah.\\" Along with other Utah Paiute tribes, the Shivwits' relationship with the federal government was terminated in the 1950s.Pritzker, 231 Unlike other Paiute groups the Shivwits retained ownership of their lands after termination and leased them to ranchers, instead of selling them outright. Recent developments The Shivwits regained federal recognition through an act signed by President Jimmy Carter on 3 April 1980. The reservation is larger than it was originally, covering 28,480 acres. In 2003 the Shivwits received water rights for annually, enabling the tribe to create new economic development projects. Today The tribe is headquartered in Ivins & the unincorporated community of Shivwits, located in Washington County, Utah. Their Band Chairperson is Jetta Wood.

He played a large role in the formation and upkeep of the Monterey, Massachusetts militia. Classically educated at Yale, he participated in the victorious Louisbourg, Nova Scotia expedition during the third French and Indian War. He is known today in part because his sermons and diary were preserved and give detailed insight into his life. Early life Adonijah Bidwell was born in Hartford, Connecticut in 1716. His father was Thomas Bidwell, a wealthy merchant and store owner involved in the triangular trade. His mother was Prudence Scott, the daughter of Edward Scott of New Haven.Franklin B. Dexter, Biographical Sketches of Graduates of Yale College (New York, 1885), pp. 639-640 The year of Bidwell's birth in 1716, Thomas Bidwell was lost at sea.Clute, Shirely S. \\"Bidwell's Saltbox House.\\" Historical Journal of Massachusetts 21, no. 2 (1993): 23. Adonijah had a comfortable childhood. As a young adult, Adonijah Bidwell attended Yale College and graduated in 1740. He was intermittently a teacher, a chaplain for the British and colonial expeditions to Canada and, finally, a full-time minister for Township No. 1 in Monterey, Massachusetts. He was said to be ordained in 1744. Career beginnings In 1745 he was the chaplain on the William Pepperrell expedition to Louisbourg during King George's War and served on the ship, Defense in 1747.Donovan, Ken. \\"Precontact and settlement: Ingonish and Northern Cape Breton from the Paleo-Indians to the 18th Century.\\" The Nashwaak Review (2009): Vol 22-23. Issue 1 He chaplained other expeditions and ships between 1744 and 1747, and in 1748, accepted an offer to become the first minister of Township No. 1. He also taught at schools during this time; in 1746 at Wintonbury, in 1747 in Simsbury, and in 1747-1748 in West Hartford. He also preached, from 1747-1750 in West Simsbury (now Canton, Connecticut) and in 1749 in Kinderhook, New York. His house, finished in 1750, was located north of the Township No. 1 Meeting House. The property was known as Deepwood Manse.Deepwood Manse Reported Sold, The North Adams Transcript (North Adams, MA) August 18, 1960, page 7, accessed January 8, 2017 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/8246253/deepwood_manse_reported_sold_the_north/ The church formed on September 25, 1750 and he was installed pastor on October 3. Family life In 1752, Adonijah Bidwell married Theodosia Colton of Suffield, Connecticut, a poetTerry, John Taylor. Rev. Edward Taylor, 1642-1720, The De Vinne Press, 1892 and the daughter of his former tutor. It was a childless marriage, and lasted until Theodosia's death in 1759 of unknown causes. A year after Theodosia died, he married Jemima Devotion of West Hartford, Connecticut, his second wife and a first cousin of Theodosia. They had four children: Adonijah the Younger, Barnabas Bidwell, Jemima Bidwell, and Theodosia Bidwell. Adonijah the Younger inherited the family farm, while Barnabas Bidwell became a member of the United States House of Representatives. He was later accused of embezzling money and fled to Canada. Jemima Devotion died in 1771. One year later, Reverend Bidwell married Ruth Kent of Suffield, Connecticut to take care of his four children. Ruth outlived the Reverend. After Adonijah's death, she married a Jonathan Judd, a second widower who was also a minister in Great Barrington. Upon his death in 1815, she lived with her brother and died at the age of 85. Church life and business Bidwell's sermons were written by himself in shorthand and later preserved. As the minister of Housatonic Township No. 1, Bidwell would have been expected to write two sermons each week. Members of the church would congregate in the morning before taking a short break for midday meal. Those close enough would travel back to their houses for dinner, however, most would bring along lunch pails. The second sermon began around 1:00 p.m. and stretched late into the afternoon. Reverend Bidwell's sermons often dealt with love or forgiveness, however his shorthand code is too complex to gain more than the basic feel of a sermon. The meetinghouse, badly constructed and only half finished when Adonijah arrived, was a poor place to hold service and town meetings. The space leaked and was bitterly cold in the wintertime. Eventually, it fell into an increasing state of disrepair and then burned down. All that remains are two foundation stones and the stone steps leading to the church. As the church slowly decayed, it is likely that Adonijah Bidwell would have held sermons in his own house, utilizing the 48 chairs listed in his death inventory. The Reverend had five punch bowls listed in this inventory. His large home may have accommodated travellers passing through Tyringham on the Boston‚ÄìAlbany Post Road which was located near the Meeting House. Bidwell the patriot As tensions between the colonies and Britain escalated, Reverend Bidwell took the side of the patriots. He also often centered his sermons around freedom, penning them in a cryptographic code to disguise the language to potential readers. In 1776, Adonijah Bidwell bore his \\"full proportion toward... the War\\" for Independence at age 62. He sold beef to the troops, gave up his salary for four years so they could be paid, and loaned the town an additional ‚Ç§60 to pay the soldiers. The debt was never repaid. Despite his fervent patriotism, Adonijah Bidwell hung several portraits of the king in his house. Messengers and soldiers under the king's command would have often stopped by frontier outposts, therefore, pictures were needed to suggest loyalty to the king.

Bothrops pulcher is a venomous pitviper species found in South America. The specific name is Latin, meaning \\"beautiful\\", in reference to the color pattern. No subspecies are currently recognized. Description A small and moderately slender species, only two lengths are given by Campbell and Lamar (2004): 76.4 cm for a specimen from Colombia and 65.9 cm for the type of Bothrops alticola, although the tail was incomplete. The scalation includes 19-23 (usually 21) rows of keeled dorsal scales, 167-178/173-181 ventral scales in males/females and 63-64/53-60 subcaudal scales in males/females, with a varying number towards the end of the tail being divided. On the head there are 5-8 keeled intersupraocular scales, 7-9 (usually 7) supralabial scales, the second of which contacts the prelacunal, and 8-10 sublabial scales. The color pattern consists of a greenish yellow or medium to dark green ground color that usually becomes more obscure towards the front of the body. The dorsal pattern is a series of 29 bands or transverse black spots that tend to fuse with each other towards the front part of the body. All of this is overlaid with a pattern of white dorsal keels. The belly is yellow with black mottling that usually increases down the body so that the tail is a uniform dark color. The end of the tail tends to be cream or pink with a rounded terminal spine. On the head, a cheek stripe is present that extends to the angle of the mouth. Above it is a parallel black stripe that runs from the supraoculars to the angle of the jaw. The labial scales are usually a very dark green color without any mottling. The iris is yellow and the tongue black. Geographic range Found in South America on the eastern slopes of the Andes from south- central Colombia to southern Ecuador and northern Peru.

The Art Festival was established in 2004, and receives public funding from Creative Scotland. The current Festival Director is Sorcha Carey. Historical background The Tobacco House, by Ettie Spencer, was one of the many installations during the 2008 Edinburgh Art Festival The Edinburgh International Festival began in 1947, and significant visual art exhibitions were included in the early years. Exhibitions included the French artists Pierre Bonnard and √âdouard Vuillard in 1948; a retrospective of the three Scottish Colourists, Samuel Peploe, Francis Cadell and Leslie Hunter in 1949; and Rembrandt in 1950. Thereafter, there was acknowledgement from the Festival authorities that the visual arts needed to be more \\"emphatically represented\\" in the Festival itself, and a series of partnerships was forged between the Festival Society and the then Arts Council of Great Britain, the Royal Museum of Scotland, the National Galleries of Scotland, the University of Edinburgh and the Royal Scottish Academy. With a few exceptions, these looked beyond the art of Scotland and contributed to a declared part of the Festival‚Äôs international aims. Not only did the exhibitions bring the works of foreign artists to Scotland, they cultivated an interest in Scotland amongst wealthy collectors and patrons from around the world. From 1966, the visual arts existed outside the programme of the Edinburgh Festival, presented instead across a wide range of organisations, from the city's permanent galleries to artist-led initiatives. This left many galleries with no visible profile in August, a time when they are programming substantial exhibitions. A campaign by newspaper Scotland on Sunday in 2001 brought together a representative group of gallery directors, and the first visual art festival was piloted in 2004. Between 2005 and 2007 the organisation produced a Festival Guide, commissions, and collaborative projects, to celebrate and promote the exhibitions of Edinburgh museums and galleries in August, creating a collective and united marketing platform in which to showcase their artistic programmes. Since 2004 Edinburgh Art Festival has grown to be Scotland's largest annual visual arts festival, and now comprises over 45 exhibitions across more than 30 venues. The festival has also commissioned or co-commissioned major artworks around the city by artists including Martin Creed, Callum Innes, Richard Wright and Susan Philipsz.

It was so called because it was the route taken by a procession celebrating the Eleusinian Mysteries. The procession to Eleusis began at the Sacred Gate in the Kerameikos (the Athenian cemetery) on the 19th Boedromion. In the present day, the road from central Athens to Aegaleo and Chaidari (the old route to Eleusis) is called the Iera Odos after the ancient road.  Mythos of Eleusis and the Origins of the Eleusinian Mysteries  The sacred rites of Demeter were performed in Eleusis in Ancient Greece beginning as far back as the 15th Century BCE, according to some sources. According to the Homeric Hymns of the Archaic period, Demeter stopped at Eleusis during her quest for Persephone. The story describes how Demeter, persuaded to stay at the palace of Eleusis by its prince, Celeus, was given the task of raising Celeus's son Demophon. When she is discovered to be a Goddess by the queen Metaneira after trying in vain to make Demophon immortal, she instructed the Eluesinians to build a temple for her. Upon later finding Persephone, she taught the leaders of Eleusis how to perform her rites. Unlike many of the cults in the Ancient Greek world, the cult of Demeter kept its rites a secret except for a chosen few, thus warranting the name the Eleusinian Mysteries. While at first the cult of Demeter remained small, it eventually grew quite large after Eleusis was incorporated into Athens during the Archaic period. After some time, it drew crowds from thousands of people around Greece, and even leaders like Peisistratos, Pericles, Hadrian, and Antoninus Pius all came to erect monuments at Eleusis. In addition, the rites became so important to the Greeks that until Roman rule, the Sacred Way remained the only road in central Greece.  Rites of the Initiates and Procession on the Sacred Way  Although the cult of Demeter kept information about its rites a secret only to those in the cult, the cult itself was open to a wide array of people. Initiates could be young or old, male or female, even slave or free. The only requirement, it seems, is that initiates could not have any sort of un-atoned bloodguilt on their hands. The process for initiates began 6 months before the procession along the Sacred Way. The initiation began at the beginning of Spring with instruction on the Lesser Mysteries, which mostly celebrated the arrival of Spring and allowed for initiates to atone themselves in preparation for the Greater Mysteries later on in the Fall. After these preliminary steps, and one month before the procession in Boedromion, special messengers, called the Spondophoroi, were sent out from Eleusis to herald the coming of the procession all around Greece. Finally, on the 13th of Boedromion, priestesses of Demeter and Persephone carried baskets of Sacred Objects, called the hiera, from Eleusis to Athens in preparation for the procession and the rites of the Greater Mysteries.  Sequence of Events  = Day One = On the first day of the celebration, initiates dressed in simple attire gathered with their teachers, as well as a large crowd, in the Agora in front of the Stoa Poikile for the proclamation by the hierophant of Demeter. The proclamation welcomed any initiate who was not morally corrupt, instructed initiates to not reveal the experiences of the rites, and told them that they must fast between sunup and sunrise during the celebration. The day then ended with a parade up to the sacred precinct of Demeter called the Eleusinion. = Day Two = The second day started early with initiates walking with their teachers, families, and friends to submerge themselves in the Bay of Phaleron. This may have been seen as a physical and spiritual cleansing ceremony for the initiates. = Day Three = The third day was a day for sacrifices and sacred offerings. Each initiate was tasked with sacrificing a suckling pig, while the officials of the ceremony sacrificed other animals for feasts later on in the day. There's a great deal of speculation as to the origins, reasons, and even practices during this day. Some suggest the blood of the suckling pig was sprinkled on the initiates for purification, while others suggest that sacrifices originally consisted of first fruits and grains, but were then discarded for animal sacrifices in protest against Athenian use of the first harvest for war taxes during the Pelopponesian War. = Day Four = On the fourth day, the cults of Asclepius, God of Medicine, and Hygieia, Goddess of Health, joined the celebration in Athens. Sacrifices were then held in the evening at the Eleusinion and special blessings were called upon for doctors and healers. At night, initiates participated in what could have been described as a night watch and invited divine visitation to help focus on healing of physical ailments, emotional distress, or spiritual limitations. At the end of the night, they would tell their dreams to an attendant and follow their guidance on how to perform certain actions for healing to occur. = Day Five = The fifth day, the 19th of Boedromion, was the day of the great procession along the Sacred Way from Athens to Eleusis. On this day, thousands of celebrants, led by the initiates and priests in front of them joined the Grand Procession beginning at the Sacred Gate. The procession was not a continuous affair, but involved multiple stops along the way. The first of these was at the shrine of the Sacred Son outside Athens, who would come and join the lead of the parade. They would then stop at the Cephissus River where kids in the procession would offer a lock of hair before moving on to the temple precinct at Daphni and the sanctuary of Aphrodite nearby. Finally, at the border between Athens and Eleusis, descendants of Krokos, the first settler of Eleusis, would meet the procession and tied yellow strands to the right wrists and left ankles of the initiates to signal Demeter. = Day Six = Festivities on day six began in the evening with the Pannychis, a nightlong revelry where women with torches danced around the well of beautiful dances, known as the Kallichoron, in Eleusis. One of the celebrations, the kernophoria involved all of the celebrants, who were led by women dancing with kernos, a vessel on their head, filled with first fruits. Likely, a special bread was made from these goods as an offering to Demeter. = Day Seven and Eight = These remain to be the most mysterious days in the process. The initiates and their teachers would enter into Demeter's temple in Eleusis for a ritual of what was known as things said (logomena), things enacted (dromena) and things seen (deiknymena), which were all part of the mystery. It is thought that this was the time when initiates acted out portions of the Mother and Daughter from the Homeric Hymns. It is also believed that this is when initiates received the epopteia, a sacred vision that was the highest stage of the initiation. Upon completion of this part of the initiation, those who had partaken went on to feel brighter hopes for the end of their lives and the rest of eternity. Finally, the initiates left the temple and walked to the Rharian Fields to invoke the rebirth of the crops. = Day Nine = The ninth and final day was the day initiates returned home. It was also the day for libations to be offered, but it is unclear to whom - some may think the dead.

Gondjout was a member of the Mpongwe ethnic group, and served in the French colonial administration from 1928, and founded the Cercle amical et mutualiste des √©volu√©s de Port-Gentil in 1943. He was a delegate to the French Senate from 1949 to 1958, and founded the Gabonese Democratic Bloc (BDG). In 1954, L√©on M'ba joined the party and eventually overthrew Gondjout as leader. In 1960, then President M'ba reshuffled the government without consulting Parliament. When Gondjout filed a motion of censure he was charged with attempting a coup d'√©tat and sentenced to two years in prison. Following his release, M'ba appointed him to the largely symbolic post of President of the Economic Council, in part to silence the threat he represented. Gondjout served as Minister of State during the abortive 1964 Gabon coup d'√©tat but was acquitted of all charges during his subsequent trial. He lived outside public view from his 1966 acquittal to his death on 1 July 1990 and there is little record of his life during this period. Early life and political career Gondjout was born on 4 June 1912, to a Mpongwe family.. He had a younger brother named Edouard. The elder Gondjout began his service in the French colonial administration in 1928. In 1943 he founded the Cercle amical et mutualiste des √©volu√©s de Port-Gentil (roughly translated as Mutual Friends for the Evolution of Port-Gentil), an organization that encouraged and utilised the talents of educated Gabonese.. With the assistance of Mpongwe businesspeople,. In 1945 he established the Gabonese Democratic Party alongside Emile Issembe.Messi Me Nang Clotaire, N‚ÄôFoule Mba Fabrice & Nnang Ndong L√©on-Modeste Le consensus politique au Gabon, de 1960 √† nos jours Gondjout was elected to the Senate of France on 24 July 1949 and re-elected on 18 May 1952‚Äîboth times as an independent candidate‚Äîserving until the end of his term on 7 June 1958. On 18 December 1953, he became the father of Laure Gondjout. She would later become a prominent politician. as would his son, Vincent de Paul Gondjout, and nephew, Georges Rawiri.. In August 1953 Gondjout's PDG merged with the Gabonese Mixed Committee to form the Gabonese Democratic Bloc (BDG). Over the course of the following seven years, the party published a newspaper. which caught the eye of the aspiring politician L√©on M'ba, whom Gondjout had earlier helped to elect to the Gabonese council of government.. The two formed an alliance supported by the Mpongwe business community, the wealthy coastal Fangs (like M'ba), and the French, which managed to overpower Jean-Hilaire Aubame and fellow members of the Gabonese Democratic and Social Union. Gondjout, the self-appointed secretary of the BDG, decreed M'ba to be the secretary- general.. He and M'ba both believed that Gabon should not have full political independence, stating shortly before it was obtained: M'ba overthrew Gondjout as head of the BDG and Goundjout aligned with Aubame on several issues, such as opposing M'ba's amount of power.. Nonetheless, when Gabon gained its independence on 17 August 1960 Gondjout was named President of the National Assembly by the new President of Gabon, Leon M'ba. In November 1960 or 1961, Gondjout called for a constitutional amendment to allow him more executive power. When M'ba reshuffled his cabinet without consulting Parliament, Gondjout filed a motion of censure.. He supposedly hoped to benefit from a balance of power modified to his own advantage, and to model Gabon after the Western democracies. M'ba, who did not share these ideas, reacted repressively. On 16 November, under the pretext of a conspiracy, M'ba declared a state of emergency, ordering the internment of eight BDG opponents and the dissolution of the National Assembly the day after. Electors were asked to vote again on 12 February 1961.. Gondjout himself was sentenced to two years in prison.. He was imprisoned in a remote village under house arrest, where he was supplied, according to U.S. ambassador to Gabon, Charles Darlington, \\"with all the whisky and beer he [could] drink and all the girls he want[ed]\\".. Unable to fulfill his position, it was given to Louis Bigmann. Upon Gondjout's release, M'ba appointed him to the mostly symbolic post of President of the Economic Council, in part to silence any threat to M'ba's power.. 1964 Gabon coup d'√©tat During the night of 17 February and the early morning of 18 February 1964, 150 members of the Gabonese military, gendarmerie, and police, headed by Lieutenant Jacques Mombo and Val√©re Essone, seized the presidential palace. They arrested President of the National Assembly Louis Bigmann,. French commanders Claude Haulin and Major Royer, several ministers, and President M'ba, who was dragged from his bed at gunpoint.. On Radio Libreville, the military announced to the Gabonese people that a coup d'√©tat had taken place, asked for technical assistance, and told the French not to interfere in this matter. M'ba was forced to broadcast a speech acknowledging his defeat, in which he said, \\"The D-Day is here, the injustices are beyond measure, these people are patient, but their patience has limits. It came to a boil.\\"\\"Le jour J est arriv√©, les injustices ont d√©pass√© la mesure, ce peuple est patient, mais sa patience a des limites... il est arriv√© √† bout.\\" Gabonese and French military officers pictured in 1959. No blood was shed during the event, and when the Gabonese people did not respond violently the military interpreted this as a sign of approval.. Aubame was offered the presidency of the newly formed provisional government.. The government was composed of civilian politicians from both the UDSG and BDG, such as Gondjout. During the coup, he served as Minister of State.. The coup's leaders were content at restoring security for the civilians. The small Gabonese army did not intervene; composed mostly of French officers, they remained in their barracks. Pesnot, Patrick (producer) & Billoud, Michel (director) (10 March 2007), 1964, le putsch rat√© contre L√©on M'Ba pr√©sident du Gabon [radio], France Inter. Retrieved on 22 August 2008. Second Lieutenant Ndo Edou gave instructions to transfer M'ba to Ndjol√©, Aubame's electoral stronghold. However, due to heavy rain, the deposed president and his captors took shelter in an unknown village. The next morning they decided to take him over the easier road to Lambar√©n√©. Several hours later, they returned to Libreville. The new head of government contacted French ambassador Paul Cousseran, to assure him that the property of foreign nationals would be protected and to request against French military intervention.. In Paris, President Charles de Gaulle decided against the plea. M'ba was one of France's most loyal African allies, and during a visit to France in 1961, declared, \\"all Gabonese have two fatherlands: France and Gabon.\\"\\"Tout Gabonais a deux patries : la France et le Gabon.\\". Moreover, under his regime, Europeans were particularly well treated. The French authorities therefore decided, in accordance with signed Franco- Gabon agreements, to restore the legitimate government. Intervention could not commence without a formal request to the Head of State of Gabon. Since M'ba was imprisoned, the French contacted the Vice President of Gabon, Paul-Marie Yembit, who had not been arrested. However, he remained unaccounted for; therefore, they decided to compose a predated letter confirming their intervention, that Yembit would later sign. Less than 24 hours later, French troops stationed in Dakar and Brazzaville landed in Libreville and restored M'ba to power... During the operation, a French soldier and 15 to 25 Gabonese died. Post coup d'√©tat Aubame and Gondjout fled Libreville, but were captured sometime before 20 February.. In August a trial of the rebels and provisional government was opened in Lambar√©n√©.. A \\"state of precations\\" was imposed, which decreed that local government keep surveillance on suspected troublemakers and, if necessary, order curfew, and special permits were required to travel through the town. The trial was held in a school building overlooking the Ogooue River, which was near Albert Schweitzer's hospital. Space at the hearing was limited, so members of the public were disallowed from attending. Permits were required to attend the trial, and family members were restricted to one permit each. Press coverage was limited, and journalists were allowed only if they represented a high-profile news agency. In addition, there were restrictions on the defence of the accused.. During a trial which carried the death sentence as a maximum, the prosecution called 64 separate witnesses. Aubame claimed he had formed his provisional government in a constitutional manner; at the request of members of the \\"putschists\\". He argued that the French intervention was effectively an illegal act of interference; a belief shared by both Gondjout and the former education minister, Jean Mare Ekoh. On 9 September, without consulting M'ba, Leon Auge handed down a verdict acquitting both Ekoh and Gondjout of all charges.. Little is known of Goundjout's life between his 1966 acquittal and death on 1 July 1990, in Libreville. . He is buried in Libreville near his wife Odette (d. 2006), a former fashion model..

Today it is surrounded by agricultural land, still nestled in the hills of the ancient Needwood Forest (now part of the National Forest) but now become a notably affluent part of the East Staffordshire borough. The eight extensive ornate partitioned gardens of Hoar Cross Hall once rivalled those of nearby Trentham, and maintained an extensive staff of gardeners in the early decades of the 20th century.

The Church The Anglican parish church of Hoar Cross is Holy Angels' Church, in the Diocese of Lichfield. It was built by the pious Anglo-Catholic, Emily Charlotte Meynall-Ingram (sister of Charles Wood, 2nd Viscount Halifax) as a memorial to her late husband Hugo Francis Meynell Ingram. The church - an extremely elaborate edifice - was designed by George Frederick Bodley and Thomas Garner. One of its more famous features is a highly elaborate set of Stations of the Cross.

Life  Marianne was born in Berlin, the daughter of the architect Alfred Breslauer (1866‚Äì1954) and Dorothea Lessing (the daughter of art historian Julius Lessing). She took lessons in photography in Berlin from 1927 to 1929, and she admired the work of the then well-known portrait photographer Frieda Riess and later of the Hungarian Andr√© Kert√©sz. In 1929 she travelled to Paris, where she briefly became a pupil of Man Ray, whom she met through Helen Hessel, a fashion correspondent for the Frankfurter Zeitung and family friend. Man Ray encouraged Breslauer to \\"go her own way without his help.\\" A year later she started work for the Ullstein photo studio in Berlin, headed up by Elsbeth Heddenhausen, where she mastered the skills of developing photos in the dark- room.Dominik Bartmann: Marianne Breslauer. Photographien: 1927‚Äì1937. Ausstellungskatalog, Stiftung Stadtmuseum, Berlin 1999, p. 10 Until 1934 her photos were published in many leading magazines such as the Frankfurter Illustrierten, Der Querschnitt, Die Dame, Z√ºrcher Illustrierten, Der Uhu and Das Magazin. In the early 1930s, Breslauer traveled to Palestine and Alexandria, before traveling with her close friend, the Swiss writer, journalist, and photographer Annemarie Schwarzenbach, whom she met through Ruth Landshoff and whom she photographed many times. She described Schwarzenbach as: \\"Neither a woman nor a man, but an angel, an archangel.\\" In 1933 they travelled together to the Pyrenees to carry out a photographic assignment for the Berlin photographic agency Academia. This led to Marianne's confrontation with the anti-Semitic practices then coming into play in Germany. Her employers wanted her to publish her photos under a pseudonym, to hide the fact that she was Jewish. She refused to do so and left Germany. However her photo Schoolgirls won the \\"Photo of the Year\\" award at the \\"Salon international d'art photographique\\" in Paris in 1934. She emigrated in 1936 to Amsterdam where she married the art dealer --he had previously left Germany after seeing Nazis break up an auction of modern art. Her first child, Walter, was born here. Family life and work as an art dealer hindered her work in photography, which she gave up to concentrate on her other activities. In 1939 the family fled to Zurich where her second son, Konrad, was born. After the war, in 1948, the couple set up an art business specializing in French paintings and 19th-century art. When her husband died in 1953 she took over the business, which she ran with her son Walter from 1966 to 1990. She died in Zollikon, near Zurich.  Work  Breslauer's work demonstrates an interest in overlooked or marginalized subjects. Her earlier work in Paris, encouraged by the surrealist photographer Man Ray, focused on the homeless along the river Seine. Her portraits show influence from the photographic experiments of Bauhaus students and the contemporary style Neues Sehen. Nonetheless, her photography conveys a strong personal interest in and approach to capturing dynamic motion, conveyed partially through her selection of bustling urban settings. Breslauer ended work in her photographic career in 1936 due to the rise of Nazism. In 1999, Breslauer was awarded the Hannah-H√∂ch-Preis for her life's work.

He is a Catholic martyr, beatified in 1929. Life Langley was probably born at Grimthorpe in Yorkshire. From his father, Richard Langley, of Rathorpe Hall, Walton, he probably inherited Rathorpe, but for the greater part of his life continued to reside on his estate at Ousethorpe, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. His mother was Joan Beaumont of Mirfield. He married Agnes, daughter of Richard Hansby, New Malton, by whom he had one son, Christopher (b. 1565), and four daughters.\\"Visitation of Yorkshire\\", ed. Foster, London, 1875. During the Elizabethan period Langley assisted the Catholic clergy; his house was offered as an asylum to priests. He constructed a subterranean retreat, perhaps beneath the Grimthorpe dwelling, which afforded them sanctuary. This refuge was betrayed to the President of the North, and on 28 October 1586, a strong band of military was despatched, several justices and Anglican ministers joining them, to make a domiciliary visitation of the Grimthorpe and Ousethorpe houses. Two priests were found in hiding at the former; at the latter Langley himself was seized. All three were carried to York, committed to prison, and subsequently arraigned before the President of the North, the priests because of their office and Langley for harbouring them.MacAuley, Patrick. \\"Richard Langley.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 8.

It rests upon custom and is largely uncodified, characteristics it shares with the government of the United Kingdom.See, e.g., Sarah Carter, \\"A Guide to the UK Legal System\\" (2001), http://www.llrx.com/features/uk2.htm#UK%20Legal%20System , accessed 7 August 2008.

Lifetime Brands purchased the business in 2005. Born in Frielendorf, Germany, he moved to Foustown in York County, Pennsylvania, United States in 1833. He arrived with his wife Hedwig Eleonore (Elenora) Bramer right after they were married on May 27, 1833 in Frielendorf. Elenora was a commoner by German standards while Johann came from a family of great distinction and the upper class, as his family owned a pottery company. The marriage was frowned upon by his family in Germany, so Johann decided that a move to the United States was in the best interests of himself and Elenora. Johann and Elenora had ten children: John Bramer, George Bramer, Elizabeth, Emma, Annie, Sarah, Lydia, Cornelius, Henry, and Isaac. After they settled into the Foustown community, Johann began his new life as a farmer. He also started his trade that he mastered while in Germany by designing and creating his own pottery. He almost immediately began making stoneware from clay that he would purchase from Ohio. He also used the local lands in the Foustown area to gather his own clays as this region of Pennsylvania is rich in clays. Later, at least three of his sons learned the trade from him. There were: John Bramer, George Bramer, and Cornelius. The oldest pieces known to exist from the family are from John Bramer Pfaltzgraff. And every one of his pieces were unique, in that he never created a duplicate piece of pottery.1 Johann George died January 7, 1873.

As mayor of Brooklyn‚Äîbefore the city's merger with New York‚Äîand New York state senator, Schroeder earned a reputation for his fight against the political machine of the Brooklyn ring and for more efficient city government. Youth in Germany Frederick A. Schroeder was born in Trier, Germany. \\"This snapshot of Frederick A Schroeder's life was captured by the 1940 U.S. Census. Frederick A Schroeder was born about 1873 in Germany. On April 1, 1940, he was 67 years old and lived in New York, New York.\\" His father Michael Schroeder was a merchant who later worked as a surveyor. From 1841, Schroeder was a pupil of the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium in Trier, one of Germany's oldest institutions of secondary education, from which Karl Marx had graduated in 1835. Schroeder's academic achievements, however, were poor. In 1848, he dropped out of the school. In the same year, Schroeder's mother, Salom√© n√©e Abel, died. One year later, Schroeder, together with his father and two sisters, left Trier and emigrated to the US. Frederick A. Schroeder's oldest brother stayed in Germany, but joined the rest of the family a few years later. The decision of the Schroeder family to leave Germany was linked to the events of the revolution of 1848. This claim is made, inter alia, in Schroeder's obituary in the York Times Michael Schroeder seems to have sympathized with the democratic cause. The family arrived in the USA on May 10, 1849 and settled in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Economic success Jupiter throwing a bolt of lightning, package label for Jupiter Cigars, a brand marketed by the firm of Schroeder & Bon (c. 1868). Even before leaving Germany, Schroeder seems to have learned the trade of a cigar worker. After his arrival in America, Schroeder started earning money by rolling cigars. Already in 1852 Schroeder was able to found his own Tobacco Manufacture. In 1863, Schroeder took on Isidore M. Bon as a partner and continued his business under the firm \\"Schroeder & Bon\\". In 1867 the firm of Schroeder & Bon switched its business activities from the production of cigars to the importation of tobacco leaves. The firm‚Äîand Schroeder personallyCarl Wilhelm Schlegel (1916‚Äî1918). Schlegel's American Families of German Ancestry. Vol. 3.

Schroeder (1859‚Äî1902) and his son in law, Frank M. Arguimbau became partners in the firm. His success in the tobacco business enabled Schroeder to start other business projects. He played an important role in the development of Shelter Island and built his own summer residence there. In 1867, Schroeder was one of the founders of Germania Savings Bank.On the subsequent history of this institution, which‚Äîafter several name changes and mergers‚Äîfailed under the name \\"Crossland Savings, FSB\\" in 1992, see the website on New York Bank History and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's report: (1997). Managing the Crisis: The FDIC and RTC Experience. Vol. 1. Chapter 11, PP. 685-704, available online at fdic.gov (PDF)] Schroeder remained president of the bank until his death. Supreme Court Cases involving Schroeder & Bon The economic success of the firm of Schroeder & Bon is also indicated by the fact that they were involved in several high-profile commercial cases which were decided by the US Supreme Court: In 1894, the firm was the losing party in the Supreme Court case of Erhardt v. Schroeder, 155 U.S. 124 (1894), which concerned the customs duties due on a shipment of tobacco. In 1905, the Supreme Court decided the case of Allen v. Arguimbau, 198 U.S. 149 (1905), which concerned issues of federal jurisdiction. Defendant Frank M. Arguimbau was sued in his capacity as surviving partner of the firm of Schroeder & Bon. Political career In 1871 Schroeder was nominated by the Republican party for the office of comptroller of Brooklyn. He was elected and served for one year. During his term, Schroeder sought to improve the city's financial situation and fought against the \\"Brooklyn ring\\" a political machine ran by the \\"Boss\\" of the Democratic party, Hugh McLaughlin. Schroeder reportedly even took some corrupt officials to court and forced them to pay back public money they had put in their own pockets. Schroeder did not seek re-election, but ran for mayor in 1875. He was elected and used his term to continue the fight against corruption. During Schroeder's tenure, Ocean Parkway was opened and the first wire of Brooklyn Bridge was strung.Brooklyn Bridge in 1877 Schroeder was a member of the New York State Senate (3rd D.) in 1880 and 1881. During his time in the senate, Schroeder was instrumental in the creation of a new city charter for Brooklyn. The new charter strengthened the position of the mayor and replaced the three- headed commissions which had presided over the city departments with single heads of departments.The Brooklyn Charter in New York Times on April 6, 1896 Schroeder also sponsored legislation limiting the amount of debt that municipalities could take on. When his term as senator expired, Schroeder retired from politics. There were several attempts by the Republican party to nominate him again for the posts of mayor of Brooklyn, governor of New York and mayor of Greater New York after the consolidation. However, Schroeder declined to run again, even though in 1896, Seth Low offered to forgo his own candidacy for the Citizens Union, should Schroeder be prepared to run against Robert Anderson Van Wyck for mayor of New York. Van Wyck was the candidate of Tammany Hall, a political machine which played a role in New York politics that was similar to (and even more important than) that of the Brooklyn ring against which Schroeder had fought as mayor of Brooklyn. The exact reasons for Schroeder's unwillingness to seek another political office are not known. However, according to Schroeder's own statement, his refusal to accept the republican nomination for the post of governor was due to the pro-prohibition stance of components of the Republican Party in the state, which Schroeder felt was driving away German-American voters.He Is Not a Candidate in New York Times on July 6, 1891 Death Schroeder died in 1899 in New York. The cause of his death was pneumonia which he had contracted at the funeral of his daughter Mary Jane (born 1866). His wife (Mary Jane Schroeder, n√©e Rusher, 1830‚Äî1913) who he had married in 1854, his son Edwin and five more daughters (Leonora Mary, born 1857, Harriet Louise, born 1861, wife of Schroeder's business partner Frank N. Arguimbau, Alice, born 1872 and Frances, born 1874) survived him. Schroeder was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery. Among his honorary pall-bearers were his former business associate Isidore M.

Each short story shows Manolo in a different stage of his life and reflects the social and historical context of Peruvian society in the 1960s. Manolo begins his journey in Italy and returns to Peru in the opening story \\"Dos Indios\\". The collection consists of the following short stories: *Dos indios (Two Indians) An unnamed narrator meets Manolo in Rome. They talk in a bar, and Manolo recalls an encounter with two indigenous men during his childhood in Peru. After their talk, Manolo resolves to return to Peru. *Con Jimmy en Paracas (With Jimmy in Paracas) A 13-year-old Manolo accompanies his father on a business trip to Paracas, a luxury resort south of Lima. They meet Jimmy, one of Manolo's classmates, whose higher social station allows him to treat the law and societal norms with contempt. *El camino es as√≠ (con las piernas, pero tambi√©n con la imaginaci√≥n (This Is The Way (with legs, but also with the imagination) Manolo and his classmates go on a school cycling trip into the Andes, but Manolo fails to keep up with the other boys. Determined to struggle on, Manolo has a moment of self-realisation in the enormity of the mountain landscape. *Su mejor negocio (His Best Deal) Manolo is now 14, and he sells his bike (the same one as in \\"El camino es as√≠\\") to Miguel, a gardener of mixed/indigenous descent with whom Manolo used to play football. He then buys himself a brown corduroy jacket with the proceeds. This story explores Manolo's increasing awareness of self-image and his place in the racial hierarchy of Peruvian society. *Las notas que duerman en las cuerdas. (The notes that sleep in the strings) Around 15 years old, Manolo has passed all of his exams, which leaves him free for the Christmas holidays. However, this gives him a lot of thinking time, and he finds himself increasingly uncomfortable with and detached from the society around him. Of particular interest in this story are his attitudes towards women, as he takes solitary walks and sees how women are treated in a machista society, and feels his impotence to protect them. *Una mano en las cuerdas (p√°ginas de un diario). (A hand on the strings (Pages from a diary)) This story takes the form of extracts from Manolo's diary, which chronicles his summer romance with Cecilia, a girl he met at the local swimming pool. Manolo learns about the concept of 'playing by the rules' and the difficulties of communication in human relationships. Manolo and Cecilia also appear in Un Mundo Para Julius, Echenique's first novel. *Un amigo de cuarenta y cuatro a√±os (A 44-year-old Friend) Back in his boys' school after his summer of love with Cecilia, Manolo takes the separation badly. His English teacher, Mr Davenhock, puts his suffering into perspective by telling him about his German girlfriend, from whom he was separated for ever by World War II. This common ground brings the two into a kind of friendship, in their shared isolation. *Yo soy el rey (I am the King) Manolo visits a brothel with some friends to lose his virginity, as a kind of right of passage into machista society. His encounter with a prostitute, la Nylon, and the characters patronising the brothel are described in grotesque detail. In this microcosm of Lima society, a \\"cholo\\" enters the brothel and proclaims himself to be the king. His expulsion from the premises reflects the social position of indigenous peoples in Peru at the time. *El descubrimiento de Am√©rica (The Discovery of America) In this story, Manolo has entered university, and takes advantage of a gullible schoolgirl by telling her all the things that she wants to hear: that he has rich parents, a big house, drives a sports car etc. Manolo gets his way, but afterwards feels the uneasiness of relationships based on falsehoods. *La madre, el hijo y el pintor (The Mother, the Son and the Painter) One of the few stories to mention Manolo's mother, La madre, el hijo y el pintor follows Manolo talking to his mother while she gets ready for a cocktail party she has been invited to by a male friend. This takes place after her divorce from Manolo's father, and she decides to take her almost adult son to introduce him to her new friends. When they arrive, they find a table set for two and a man who seems less than pleased with an unexpected teenager at his dinner date. *El hombre, el cinema y el tranv√≠a (The Man, the Cinema and the Tram) After a visit to the cinema, Manolo and a friend head to a bar. On the way, a man is run down and killed by a tram. The pair do not join the crowd that gathers around the victim, and continue to the bar. There, they talk about philosophy, life, and the inevitability of death. Notably, Manolo decides not to drink beer, and instead orders a pisco, showing his rejection of shared routines and traditions. *Extra√±a diversi√≥n (Strange Diversion) The final story finds Manolo on the beach at Lima, acting very strangely. He picks up rocks and articles of rubbish, noting everything down in a notebook, and speaks in disjointed phrases and infinitives. There are no references to his age in this story, and it is left to the reader to decide: is this Manolo before he went to Rome, where he was able to get his mind together again? Or is this Manolo after his return to Peru, driven mad by the divided society he thought he could escape in Europe, but was compelled to return? 1968 short story collections Single-writer short story collections ","title":"Huerto Cerrado"},{"id":"18811833","text":"M√ºnster in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. Communion table or Lord's table are terms used by many Protestant churches‚Äîparticularly from Reformed, Baptist and low church Anglican and Methodist bodies‚Äîfor the table used for preparation of Holy Communion (a sacrament also called the Eucharist). These churches usually do not use the term \\"altar\\" because they do not see Communion as sacrificial in any way. However, in colloquial speech, the word \\"altar\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"communion table\\".Michael Keene, Christian Churches Nelson Thornes 2001 , p. 58 Terminology The use of a simple table, generally built of wood, instead of an altar made of stone reflects these churches' rejection of the suggestion of sacrifice in the rite: they believe that the Passion of Jesus Christ was a perfect sacrifice for sins made once for all (-10:4). Many Protestant churches that choose not to use the term \\"altar\\" may still have an \\"altar call\\", in which visitors wish to make a new spiritual commitment to Jesus Christ are invited to come forward to the front of the church.Harvey Cox, Fire from Heaven (Da Capo Press 2001 ), p. 274Elaine J. Lawless, God's Peculiar People (University of Kentucky 2005 ), p. 57Gary Bouma, Australian Soul (Cambridge University Press 2006 ), p. 95 Having or not having a Communion table was a subject of dispute within Scottish Presbyterianism in the 17th century, with the Independents opposing its use. The United Methodist Church states that the term \\"altar\\" is often used but the correct (traditional) terms are \\"Lord's table\\" and \\"Communion table\\" for the table upon which the elements are placed during Holy Communion. High church Methodists may use the term \\"altar\\" exclusively, mirroring the Anglican usage. Location and adornment This Presbyterian church in Duirinish, Skye has a small Communion table in front of a prominent pulpit, illustrating the church's dual ministry of Word and Sacrament. The table may be very simple, adorned perhaps with only a linen cloth, or with an open Bible or some receptacle to collect an offering. In modern use many Protestants adorn their tables with candles, though the use of candles was historically rejected among some Protestants. Some Communion tables bear the inscription Do This in Remembrance of Me from the Last Supper (, ), indicating the belief in Holy Communion being a memorial rather than a sacrifice, or the words Holy, Holy, Holy as a recollection of the union between the whole of creation in worship. Such a table may be temporary, being moved into place when there is a Communion Service, but generally holds a permanent (or semi-permanent) position of some prominence in the worship space. Instead of a high altar, the sanctuary may be dominated only by a large, centralized pulpit.Huldrich Zwingli's minister church in Basel Some bring in a Communion table only when needed. For example, St Andrew's Anglican Cathedral in Sydney does not have a prominent Communion table. The strongly Evangelical church leadership decided that the table should be placed in a more forward position in the chancel and that it should be easily portable in order that it might be removed when not required for Holy Communion, to clear a space for presentations and musical performances.

She was a member of the House of Aviz and later, House of Braganza. Family She was the sister of Manuel I of Portugal and Leonor of Viseu. Her maternal grandparents were Infante Jo√£o of Portugal and his wife Isabella of Barcelos. Her paternal grandparents were Edward of Portugal and Leonor of Aragon. Isabel's cousin was Isabella I of Castile, wife of Ferdinand II of Aragon and mother of the English queen, Catherine of Aragon. Life Marriage She married Fernando II, Duke of Braganza, a marriage that would later end in tragedy. This was Fernando's second marriage, after the death of his first wife, Leonor de Menezes. Leonor had not borne any children, so Isabel needed to deliver a son. Isabel and Fernando had seven children: * Filippe de Braganza (July 6, 1475 - 1483) * Jaime, Duke of Braganza (1479 - September 20, 1532), succeeded his father as Duke of Braganza. Married firstly to Eleanor of Mendoza, had issue. Married secondly to Joana de Mendo√ßa and had issue. * Joachim de Braganza (1479 - September 20, 1532) * Dinis of Braganza, Count of Lemos (1481 - May 9, 1516), younger surviving son and ancestor of John IV of Portugal. * Afonso de Bragan√ßa * Catarina de Bragan√ßa * Margarida de Bragan√ßa (Braganza), died young in June 1483. Downfall Even at a young age, John II of Portugal was not popular among the peers of the kingdom since he was immune to external influence and appeared to despise intrigue. The nobles (including particularly Isabela's husband, the Duke of Braganza) were afraid of his future policies as king. Events proved them right. After the official accession to the throne in 1481, John II took a series of measures to curtail the overgrown power of his aristocracy and to concentrate power on himself. Immediately, the nobles started to conspire; John II did nothing but observe. Letters of complaint and pleas to intervene were exchanged between the Duke of Braganza and Queen Isabella I of Castile. In 1483, this correspondence was intercepted by royal spies. The House of Braganza was outlawed, their lands confiscated and Isabel's husband executed in √âvora. The following year Isabel's brother was murdered by King John himself because there was word of a new conspiracy that also involved Isabel's second cousin and her father's brother in law. Isabel's family would have felt safe because her sister Leonor was married to John II, but they weren't safe at all. Many other members of Isabel's family were murdered including her elder brother Diogo, Duke of Viseu. Later years In 1495, John died without surviving legitimate issue and Isabel's brother succeeded him as Manuel I of Portugal. At first, Leanor was made heiress but because she was Dowager Queen and had no surviving children, the post as heiress was passed to Isabel, who in turn passed it to her eldest son Jaime, who was heir from 1495 until 1498 when Manuel's son Miguel da Paz, Prince of Portugal was born. Isabel died in 1521, she was 62 years of age at the Lisbon Convent of the Mother of God,Portugal, Medieval Lands her brother died later in the year, her sister Leonor died 4 years later. Out of their four children Jaime and Dinis survived to adulthood, Jaime later succeeded his father as Duke of Braganza.

Known for a series of critically acclaimed albums in the 1990s culminating with an appearance (as September 67) on the Lilith Fair tour and for collaborations with fellow Charlottesville-based musicians Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds, Worrell's acoustic songwriting has been described as \\"subtly orchestrated chamber pop\\" and \\"like a lean country cousin of the Throwing Muses.\\" Early career and Three Wishes Worrell was born in Charlottesville to a prominent local media family; her father, Thomas E. Worrell, inherited a media network consisting of the Charlottesville Daily Progress and 28 other newspapers. She graduated from the University of Virginia in 1990 and stayed in Charlottesville, participating in the local music scene. Worrell played in a band called Paris Match in the early part of the decade, but left to work as a solo artist sometime after 1991. She played in various locations around Charlottesville's Downtown Mall for several years; in particular, she jammed with Haines Fullerton (formerly of local band the Deal), Tim Reynolds, and Dave Matthews on several occasions.Delancey, 107. All three would subsequently perform on her solo recordings. Worrell's first album, Three Wishes, was released in 1994 on her own label, Super Duke Records. The album, co-produced by John Alagia, was recorded in a basement studio in Northern Virginia and comprises nine original songs in a mostly acoustic setting. Collaborators on the album included Tim Reynolds, the Dave Matthews Band's LeRoi Moore, and Matthews himself, who sang backing vocals on \\"Eleanor.\\" Haines Fullerton participated as well, writing vocal arrangements for the album. Monsoon and September 67 Between 1995 and 1998, Worrell collaborated with a number of Charlottesville area musicians in various group settings. The first to form was a trio collaboration with Kristin Asbury and Lauren Hoffman initially called Monsoon.Delancey, 66. During this time period, the group appeared on the Dear Charlottesville compilation to support the local club scene.Delancey, 160. Initially, all three members were contributors to Monsoon. However, Hoffman ultimately decided she wanted to go her own way and left the band, eventually signing a contract with Virgin Records. Worrell and Asbury continued as a duo under the name September 67. The group signed to The Enclave, an indie label affiliated with EMI, and released the album Lucky Shoe at the end of 1996. Lucky Shoe was produced by David Lowery of Camper Van Beethoven and Cracker and featured contributions from Bryan Harvey, John Alagia (who co-wrote \\"Little Lantern Face\\"), and the backing musicians from Sparklehorse. The tour behind Lucky Shoe saw them supporting Wilco's \\"Being There\\" tour, and participating in Lilith Fair '97. During the Lilith Fair tour, the group recorded a live song called \\"Steve Malkmus is a Fucking Snob,\\" which appeared as a non-album track on the EP \\"What's Wrong with Alice.\\" The song earned the band some controversy and a mention in Rolling Stone. When The Enclave was acquired by Virgin Records, Worrell's contract was not picked up, and the band made the decision to go their separate ways. The Moviegoer, hiatus, and new album Post September 67, Worrell returned to the studio to record a follow up album. The Moviegoer, released in April 2000 on her Super Duke label, saw her collaborating again with Kristin Asbury, Bryan Harvey; the album features John Stirratt on bass, John Linnell on accordion and was produced by his wife, Karen Brown. Worrell took time off from music after the release of the album to raise her children and start Light House Studio, a non-profit media education center for Charlottesville youth. At the end of 2007, Worrell began performing publicly again, playing supporting gigs for Charlottesville band Sons of Bill.\\" In 2008, she entered the studio to record her first album in eight years, The Honey Guide. The album was released in October 2008, and was a featured pick on the iTunes folk store. In 2009, Worrell wrote original music for \\"Our American Ann Sisters\\", performed at Live Arts by PEP (Performers' Exchange Project), written by Martha Mendenhall. In 2018, Kristin Hott and Worrell's band, September 67, performed a 20th reunion concert to benefit The Bridge Progressive Arts Initiative in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Background  Events prior to August 2008 are described in 2008 Russo-Georgian diplomatic crisis. Tensions began escalating in 2008 since Kosovo declared its independence, but the definitive trigger was a bombing on the road near Tskhinvali on 1 August, which injured five Georgian policemen. This provocation allegedly was prepared in advance. A chain of reactions and counter-reactions followed.  Overview timeline  * August 1 - The explosion on the road near Tskhinvali, which had been probably engineered by South Ossetian separatists, injured five Georgian policemen. That night, intense fighting erupted between Georgians and the South Ossetian separatists. The casualties were six Ossetian militiamen killed. * August 7 - At 19:00, President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili announced on television a unilateral ceasefire. He asked the South Ossetians to cease fire. After this, attacks became intense against the Georgian villages. * August 8 - After returning fire, Georgian troops advanced towards the capital of the self-proclaimed Republic of South Ossetia, Tskhinvali, during the night. President Saakashvili later stated that Russia had already sent tanks to South Ossetia before he gave the order for Georgian forces to launch a military operation.

Detailed timeline   August 1 ‚Äì August 6  A Georgian police car was blown up at 08:05 on the Eredvi-Kheiti road. Joint Peacekeeping Forces (JPKF) commander's media assistant Captain Vladimir Ivanov reported that JPKF military observers from all three sides and OSCE representatives investigated a bomb attack. The explosion, which had been probably engineered by South Ossetian separatists, injured five Georgian policemen. 122 mm artillery shells had been used to make the bombs, according to Russian peacekeepers. According to the Russian peacekeepers, a Georgian sniper from near to the village of Prisi killed one South Ossetian militia member at about 18:17. South Ossetian de facto leader Eduard Kokoity claimed late that day that a \\"sniper war\\" was being conducted by Georgia and accused Ukraine and the United States of being responsible for this. Ossetian separatists began shelling Georgian villages on 1 August at the earliest, with a sporadic response from Georgian peacekeepers and other troops in the region. During the night of 1/2 August, the worst outbreak of violence in the past four years happened. South Ossetia accused Georgia of firing first. South Ossetian authorities reported that the number of killed Ossetians was six (including one North Ossetian peacekeeper), and the number of injured was fifteen. Georgian Interior Ministry stated that the Georgian villages of Zemo Nikozi, Kvemo Nikozi, Nuli and Ergneti were shelled. The Georgian casualties were six injured civilians and one injured policeman. Georgian defense ministry official Mamuka Kurashvili said that the Georgians only responded to the South Ossetian shelling and suspected that Russian peacekeepers were also involved in the shelling of the Georgian villages. On 3 August, the Russian government said that the situation was becoming more and more dangerous. The South Ossetians began evacuation from probable war into Russia, which resulted in twenty bus-loads of refugees leaving the region on the first day. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 1,100 refugees arrived in North Ossetia by bus in early August. According to the former secretary of the Security Council of South Ossetia, Anatoly Barankevich, about 35,000 people were evacuated from South Ossetia. It was reported on 3 August that five battalions of the Russian 58th Army were moved to the vicinity of Roki Tunnel in North Ossetia. South Ossetian president Eduard Kokoity said on 4 August that about 300 volunteers had arrived from North Ossetia to help fight the Georgians, and thousands more were expected from the North Caucasus. Georgian minister Temur Iakobashvili travelled to South Ossetia to propose direct talks. He was not let into Tskhinvali and the separatists refused to meet him. Iakobashvili met with the commander of the Joint Peacekeeping Forces, Marat Kulakhmetov and Georgian commander Mamuka Qurashvili at the Ergneti checkpoint. Iakobashvili earlier had told a Georgian newspaper that the Georgian government would begin direct talks with the South Ossetian separatists \\"without any conditions\\", but would only agree to \\"a solution founded upon respect for Georgia's territorial integrity.\\" On 5 August, Georgian authorities had organised a tour for journalists and diplomats to demonstrate the separatist-caused damage. Russian ambassador-at- large Yuri Popov declared that Russia would intervene on the side of South Ossetia. South Ossetian president Kokoity blamed Georgia of \\"attempting to spark a full-scale war\\". The South Ossetian presidential envoy to Moscow, Dmitry Medoyev, declared that volunteers were already arriving, primarily from North Ossetia, to South Ossetia. He said that the regions of North Caucasus and the Cossacks were ready to help South Ossetia. He claimed that Tskhinvali relied mostly on its own forces. On 5 August, Russia, Georgia and South Ossetia agreed to hold negotiations on 7 August, with Georgian minister Temur Iakobashvili attending talks in Tskhinvali. However, Georgia still opposed to the format of the Joint Control Commission. The Georgian state minister for reintegration Temur Iakobashvili said that a meeting between him and Boris Chochiev was decided and chief Russian negotiator over South Ossetia, Yuri Popov, would be attending. However, later the South Ossetians denied any agreement for such meeting. On 6 August, the South Ossetian Press and Information Committee reported that Boris Chochiev said that the South Ossetians had agreed to \\"a consultative meeting\\" in Tskhinvali on 7 August. However, later the South Ossetians refused to participate in bilateral talks, demanding a JCC session. On 6 August, it was reported that the South Ossetian claim of having killed twenty-nine Georgian servicemen in the clashes in the past week was not proven.

Nezavisimaya Gazeta (NG) reported that events in South Ossetia could only be assessed as war. Starting with the night of 6‚Äì7 August, there was continuous fire. At 6 AM on the morning of 7 August, firing resumed. A reporter concluded that assault rifles, heavy artillery and grenade launchers were used. Tskhinvali hospital had been receiving the wounded all night. According to the Tskhinvali hospital, they received 14 wounded people. Anatoly Barankevich, the secretary of the Security Council of South Ossetia, claimed that the clashes began when the Georgians unsuccessfully attempted to seize a key height near the village Nuli on 6 August. According to Barankevich, Georgian special troops from the ministry of defense attempted to capture the Prisi Heights on the morning of 7 August. The hotel administrator in Tskhinvali refused to accept payment from a NG reporter, saying, \\"Maybe, here something will happen, that you will have to leave prematurely. So the bank won't work, and we won't be able to refund your money.\\" JPKF commander's assistant Vladimir Ivanov told NG that the peacekeepers had documented five illegal overflights of the Georgian Su-25 jets from the Gori district towards Java and three drones during the night of 6‚Äì7 August. Nezavisimaya Gazeta also reported that Russian troops were being pulled towards the Georgian border, however Russian military claimed that they continued their exercises. According to the phone calls intercepted by the Georgian intelligence, regular (non-peacekeeping) Russian military entered South Ossetia in the early hours of 7 August through the Roki Tunnel. Later that day, even the state-controlled Russian TV showed Abkhazia's de facto president Sergei Bagapsh, who said at a meeting of the Abkhaz National Security Council: \\"I have spoken to the president of South Ossetia. It has more or less stabilized now. A battalion from the North Caucasus District has entered the area.\\" Although South Ossetian separatists initially said in the morning that six people were wounded after fire exchange during the night and morning, later they said that the casualties were increased to eighteen. The Georgian Interior Ministry said the Georgian villages of Eredvi, Prisi, Avnevi, Dvani and Nuli were shelled on late 6 August and two Georgian peacekeepers were wounded. The South Ossetians claimed that fire recommenced at about 10. According to Russia Today, after Russian peacekeepers intervened in the conflict, fire exchange stopped for 40 minutes. Russia Today claimed that Georgian tanks were reportedly moving towards South Ossetia. South Ossetian de facto president Kokoity said that \\"South Ossetia stopped shooting for 40 minutes\\". Around 14:00, the South Ossetians renewed their shelling and killed two Georgian peacekeepers in Avnevi. According to Georgian Prime Minister Lado Gurgenidze, these were the first Georgian deaths in South Ossetia since the nineties. At about 14:30, Georgian tanks, 122 mm howitzers and 203 mm self-propelled artillery began heading towards South Ossetia to dissuade separatists from additional attacks. According to The Washington Post, Georgian infantry left their bases in late afternoon and began moving toward South Ossetia. During the afternoon, OSCE monitors recorded Georgian military traffic, including artillery, on roads near Gori. In the afternoon, Georgian personnel left the Joint Peacekeeping Force headquarters in Tskhinvali. Georgian official said that South Ossetian militia blew up an APC by a rocket propelled grenade and three Georgian peacekeepers were wounded. Temur Iakobashvili had refused any talks in the Joint Control Commission (JCC) format, since the commission \\"is responsible for what is happening in the region,\\" adding if Russian \\"puppets\\" would not be forced to negotiate then Russia's status as a mediator would be \\"in doubt.\\" A Russian co-chairman of the JCC, Yury Popov, said in Tbilisi he was going to visit Tskhinvali with Iakobashvili: \\"We have not yet arranged a trip to Tskhinvali...The negotiations will be held if the situation allows it.\\" South Ossetian leader Eduard Kokoity had earlier warned Popov that his visit to Tskhinvali would be \\"dangerous\\". Georgian Foreign Ministry issued a statement calling on Russia to force the separatists to stop the systematic shelling and saying, \\"Responsibility for the latest events lies with Russia.\\" The Georgian diplomats said that mercenaries and military hardware were moving to South Ossetia through the Roki Tunnel. In the afternoon South Ossetia claimed that lots of Georgian troops were advancing towards them. Abkhaz Defense Minister Mirab Kishmaria had said earlier: \\"The Abkhazian Security Council held a meeting [earlier] today, where our republic's Commander-in-Chief Sergei Bagapsh gave me instructions to put our troops on combat readiness.\\" At 16:00, Temur Iakobashvili arrived in Tskhinvali for a previously-arranged meeting with South Ossetians and Russian diplomat Yuri Popov; however, Russia's special envoy, who blamed a flat tire, did not appear; and neither did the Ossetians. Temur Iakobashvili met with General Marat Kulakhmetov (the Russian commander of the Joint Peacekeeping Force), who said that Russian peacekeepers could not stop Ossetian attacks and Georgia should implement a ceasefire. \\"Nobody was in the streets ‚Äì no cars, no people,\\" Iakobashvili told journalists several days later. According to Russia Today, by the evening four people were reported to have been killed and more than two dozen wounded. Later it was reported that about 12 people were killed and more than 20 injured on 7 August. At 18:10, Russian peacekeepers told the OSCE monitors that Georgian artillery was fired on Khetagurovo. But independent verification of this report was impossible. At around 19:00, Georgian President Saakashvili, ordered a unilateral ceasefire and no-response order. \\"A sniper war is ongoing against residents of villages [in the South Ossetian conflict zone] and as I speak now intense fire is ongoing from artillery, from tanks, from self-propelled artillery systems ‚Äì which have been brought into the conflict zone illegally ‚Äì and from other types of weaponry, including from mortars and grenade launchers,\\" Saakashvili said in a live TV address at 19:10. Saakashvili called for negotiations \\"in any type of format,\\" reaffirmed the offer of \\"unrestricted autonomy\\" for South Ossetia, proposed that Russia should become the guarantor of that solution, offered a general amnesty, and pleaded for international help to stop the hostilities. Ceasefire was announced after a skirmish that had killed up to ten Georgian peacekeepers and civilians, according to the Georgian authorities. Russia regarded the ceasefire as an attempt to buy time to deploy Georgian forces for an offensive. The separatists shelled Tamarasheni and Prisi after Saakashvili's ceasefire. They destroyed Avnevi and a police station in Kurta (seat of the Provisional Administrative Entity of South Ossetia). The escalated attacks forced civilians to flee the Georgian villages. Georgian Interior Ministry official later told the Russian newspaper Kommersant (on 8 August) that after this, \\"it became clear\\" that South Ossetians wouldn't stop firing and the Georgian casualties were 10 killed and 50 wounded. Georgian foreign minister Eka Tkeshelashvili called the Assistant Secretary of State of the United States, Daniel Fried. She told him that Russian tanks were moving towards South Ossetia, but Fried replied that war must be avoided. Georgian forces returned fire after the separatist shelling. Mamuka Kurashvili, head of the Georgian peacekeeping operations, told journalists late on August 7 that the South Ossetian violation of a unilateral ceasefire forced Georgia \\"to restore constitutional order\\". Georgia said the operation against the separatists would establish a \\"durable peace\\". South Ossetian envoy to Moscow, Dmitry Medoyev called the ceasefire that was announced on 7 August a \\"smokescreen\\". The United Nations Security Council meeting was organized on 7 August at 23:00 (US EST time) upon Russias's request. Georgia participated in a follow-up open meeting held at 01:15 (US EST time) on 8 August. A discussion for a press statement calling for an end to hostilities did not reach a consensus.

Eduard Kokoity said: \\"The enemy has suffered considerable losses from our forces. Our troops feel confident.\\" Kakha Lomaia, the secretary of the Georgian National Security Council, said on the same day that Russian army units were moving towards the Roki tunnel. At about 04:45 MSK, Georgian State Minister for Reintegration Temur Iakobashvili announced that Tskhinvali was nearly surrounded. He said that \\"we don't desire demolitions or victims, so we again offer the separatist leaders to begin direct talks over ceasefire and de-escalation of the situation in the conflict zone\\". While before 8 August, more than half of South Ossetian territory was controlled by the Georgian authorities, after capturing five South Ossetian villages Georgia was controlling two-thirds of the South Ossetian territory. In the early morning, an unspecified number of Abkhaz troops were sent to the border of the arms limitation zone between Abkhazia and Georgia proper after Abkhaz Security Council had decided so. However, high combat readiness was not yet announced. According to Georgia, the Russian forces first entered South Ossetia at 05:30 on 8 August. Interfax reported that by 6:00, Abkhazia began moving heavy weaponry and troops towards the Georgian border. President of North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania, Taimuraz Mamsurov, claimed that a number of Sukhoi Su-25 aircraft of the Georgian Air Force attacked what he described to be a humanitarian aid convoy en route from Vladikavkaz. Mamsurov, who had accompanied the convoy, was unharmed. \\"... –∫–æ–ª–æ–Ω–Ω—É —Ä–∞–∑–±–æ–º–±–∏–ª–∏. –ü–æ–∫–∞ —è –Ω–µ –º–æ–≥—É —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç—å –æ –ø–æ–≥–∏–±—à–∏—Ö –∏ —Ä–∞–Ω–µ–Ω—ã—Ö, –Ω–æ —ç—Ç–æ –±—ã–ª–∏ –≥—Ä—É–∑–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–µ –°—É-25\\" Iakobashvili told Agence France-Presse that Georgian government did not wish \\"to assault Tskhinvali, but to neutralise separatist positions,\\" and that Georgian troops had captured eight South Ossetian villages. A South Ossetian government website said Tskhinvali was being assaulted by the Georgian military. South Ossetian leader Eduard Kokoity had told Interfax that the Georgian attack on Tskhinvali was a \\"perfidious and vile\\" act. By the morning, the South Ossetian authorities had reported at least 15 civilians had been killed as a result of the Georgian shelling. The Georgian minister Temur Iakobashvili said that day that Georgia intended to eliminate \\"a criminal regime\\". A Georgian TV station Imedi announced that Georgian military was in control of Tskhinvali at 08:25. Another Georgian TV, Rustavi-2 had reported that eight South Ossetian villages (among them Sarabuk, a strategic vantage point on high ground) had been secured by the Georgian forces. The Permanent Representative of Russia to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin called an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council at 01:15 (US EST time) where an exchange of accounts was made with the Georgian ambassador. After the meeting, Churkin said that some of the council members would not agree to \\"the renunciation of the use of force\\". Churkin claimed he had warned the council about a \\"Georgian military buildup\\" in South Ossetia in the past days. He condemned Georgian rejection of the non-use of force against South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Around 10:00, Georgia reported that three Russian Su-24 attack aircraft flew into the Georgian airspace. One Su-24 bombed the area near a police station of the town of Kareli and several civilians were wounded. Later that day, the source in the Russian Ministry of Defense told the Russian newspaper Kommersant, \\"the [Russian] planes attacked only military targets: military base in Gori, airfields in Vaziani and Marneuli, where [Georgian] Su-25 and L-39 airplanes are based, as well as the radar station 40 kilometres from Tbilisi\\". When asked why Russian warplanes entered Georgian airspace well before Russian government announced the involvement in the conflict, the officer responded, \\"As per order from our command.\\" On the morning of 8 August, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who was in Beijing attending the 2008 Summer Olympics, condemned the Georgian government for \\"aggressive actions\\" and said he had spoken with American President George Bush and Chinese leaders. Putin threatened that Georgian \\"aggression\\" against the separatists would incur a Russian \\"response\\". Georgian authorities stated that they began using aviation only after three Russian Su-24 planes had flown into the Georgian airspace at 11:00. According to Kommersant, Georgian official said that by that time Russian peacekeepers had not participated in the conflict. It was reported that at about 11:30, four Russian aircraft intruded into Georgian airspace and dropped a bomb near the city of Gori with no casualties. Shota Utiashvili, a spokesman for the Georgian Interior ministry, dismissed Russian media report that Georgians had entered Tskhinvali and said that Georgia wanted \\"to give time to the remaining civilians to leave Tskhinvali,\\" adding \\"if the need arises\\", then Georgians would move in. Utiashvili said that Georgian troops were fighting against two Russian convoys of trucks moving towards Tskhinvali. Eduard Kokoity said: \\"We are in full control of the capital city. Fighting is on the city limits.\\" Russian peacekeepers had reported that several of them were killed or wounded after Georgian attack. By 11:38, Saakashvili had announced the mobilisation of the Georgian reserve troops in the middle of what he referred to as a \\"large-scale military aggression\\" by Russia and called for Russia to stop bombardment of the Georgian towns. He also said: \\"A large part of Tskhinvali is now liberated and fighting is ongoing in the center of Tskhinvali.\\" That day, Saakashvili said that two Russian military aircraft had been shot down by the Georgians. Later that day, it was reported by Georgia that four Russian warplanes were shot down and Georgians fought against two convoys of mercenaries from Russia. Contradicting a Georgian report, the Russian Ministry of Defence denied that a Russian war plane had been shot down over the Georgian territory, calling it \\"informational provocation\\". RIA Novosti reported that day that the Russian diplomat Yuri Popov denied the Georgian reports of Russian bombings and called them \\"misinformation\\". At 14:15 local time, Georgia announced that they offered a three-hour ceasefire to let civilians leave Tskhinvali. However, by 14:29 MSK, Marat Kulakhmetov, commander of the peacekeeping forces in the region, had said that \\"these are further lies from the Georgian side. No corridor for civilians has been opened.\\" Georgia later said (on 9 August) that civilians did not manage to use the safe corridor during the three-hour ceasefire because of Russian bombing. By 15:00 MSK, an emergency meeting of Security Council had been convened by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russia's options regarding the conflict in South Ossetia had been discussed. At about 15:00, Eduard Kokoity was meeting with the North Ossetian leader Taymuraz Mamsurov in Java. Mamsurov was followed by about one thousand volunteers, and one of the columns was bombed by the Georgian aviation. Java had been transformed into quite-well equipped fortification in the previous months. One Georgian diplomat told Kommersant that by capturing Tskhinvali they wanted to demonstrate that Georgia wouldn't tolerate killing of Georgian citizens and capturing Java was not their intention. At around 16:00 local time, the Georgian Interior Ministry said that two bombs were dropped on the Vaziani Military Base near Tbilisi by a Russian aircraft without any casualties. The bombed site had housed the Russian army before they were forced to withdraw to Russia by the Georgian government before the war.

After the opening ceremonies in Beijing, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin told U.S. President George W. Bush that \\"a real war\\" had begun in South Ossetia, to which Bush reportedly replied that \\"no one wants war\\", and Putin added that \\"in Russia many volunteers intend to go there (in South Ossetia to fight) and undoubtedly, it is very difficult to maintain peace in the region\\".

I quote again: 'Saakashvili must go'. This is completely unacceptable and crosses the line.\\" The Russian ambassador responded by saying, \\"On Ambassador Khalilzad‚Äôs interesting reference to a confidential diplomatic telephone call between our Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Secretary of State, I must say at the outset that regime change is an American expression. We do not use such expressions.\\" After the meeting, CNN reported, \\"But Churkin drew a rebuke from other Security Council members, including its current president, after he questioned the objectivity of a top U.N. official who briefed ambassadors on the conflict in Georgia\\".

Sky News correspondents confirmed that Russian tanks were in Gori. Sky News correspondents said that they were robbed at gunpoint, apparently by South Ossetian irregulars, and they had to return to Gori on foot. Norwegian journalists were also robbed in the centre of Gori that day. The New York Times reported Czech journalists were robbed and that \\"almost completely empty\\" Gori was \\"firmly occupied\\". That day, The New York Times interviewed Russian commanders, who did not view their presence in Gori, the city where Joseph Stalin was born, as a violation of the ceasefire. One Russian soldier even said, \\"If [Saakashvili] does not understand the situation, we‚Äôll have to go farther. It‚Äôs just 60 kilometers to Tbilisi.\\" Another Russian officer confirmed attacks on Georgian villages. Human Rights Watch researchers reported that militias were responsible for \\"terrifying scenes of destruction\\" in ethnic Georgian villages. Anna Neistat said that Russian claims of systematic atrocities by Georgian military could not be supported by any evidence. An Associated Press reporter witnessed the Russian tanks and military vehicles leaving Gori for Tbilisi, however the Russians stopped about an hour's drive from Tbilisi and encamped. Georgian troops occupied the road closer to Tbilisi and began preparing a defense line. South Ossetian militias reportedly had begun looting in Gori. Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko signed a decree requiring that Russian Black Sea Fleet should seek the permission of Ukrainian authorities at least 72 hours prior to any movements. American president George W. Bush sent American troops on a humanitarian mission. This was hailed by Georgian president Saakashvili, which labelled the relief operation as a \\"turning point\\". Saakashvili assessed the American operation as a defence of Georgian ports and airports, however American officials denied this, with one senior official saying, \\"We won‚Äôt be protecting the airport or seaport, but we‚Äôll certainly protect our assets if we need to.\\" The first American C-17 Globemaster aircraft arrived in Tbilisi that day and brought humanitarian and medical supplies. Condoleezza Rice and George Bush accused Russia of continued presence in Georgia in violation of the ceasefire, however Russia claimed its actions complied with the ceasefire. After Bush had announced his support for Georgia, Georgian officials said that Russian began withdrawal from Gori. Russian official estimated that Gori would be returned to Georgians in two days. Saakashvili said, \\"We have been warning them a large scale Russian invasion is coming. (The) State Department told us the Russians are not going to do that.\\" Although journalists had reported that Russian military violated the ceasefire, Anatoly Nogovitsyn claimed on 13 August that it was Georgia in violation of ceasefire. According to Al Jazeera, \\"Russia's military on Wednesday repeatedly denied that any troops were inside Gori.\\" Georgian president Saakashvili had accused Russia of \\"Balkan-type and World War II-type ethnic cleansing and purification campaigns\\". Russia said that \\"despite the assurances from the Georgian side that they have ended all military activities, Russian troops shot down a second Georgian drone over Tskhinvali earlier today.\\" Georgia reported that 175 Georgians had died from the war. Georgian soldiers returning to Tbilisi from the front outside Gori on August 14, 2008.  August 14  14 August had been announced as a day of mourning for the South Ossetian victims in Abkhazia. It was reported on early 14 August that there was calm in Gori. At about 10:00, joint patrols of Georgian police and Russian forces in Gori was ordered by Russian major general while Russian troops were preparing to withdraw. Interfax reported at 12:10 MSK that the Russian army gave back control of Gori to the Georgian Police. The representative of the Russian Ministry of Defence, major-general Vyacheslav Borisov claimed that the rumours about damaged town and marauding did not correspond to reality. Secretary of National Defence Council of Georgia Alexander Lomaia, who was in Gori negotiating with the Russians, said on \\"Rustavi-2\\" TV on the live broadcast that the situation in Gori was calm and Russian army only did patrolling job. At about 13:00, joint patrol efforts in Gori broke down due to apparent tensions among personnel. Although the Russian troops were ready for the handover of Gori, they postponed it. It was alleged that this happened due to Moscow assessing the U.S. humanitarian mission, which meant support for President Saakashvili. A stand-off took place near Gori between the Georgian police and the Russian forces with the Russian tanks arriving as reinforcements and the Georgians left the area. It was reported that near Gori five explosions took place. Russians reportedly had probably blown up a military depot near Gori. A BBC correspondent in Gori reported that day to have heard explosions. Georgian police allegedly reported that the refusal of the South Ossetians to leave Gori caused the Russian withdrawal to be canceled. Georgian official Alexander Lomaia was negotiating permission for the Georgian police to enter Gori. The Telegraph reported that \\"Meanwhile, South Ossetian irregulars continuing to loot and pillage in Gori and nearby Georgian villages, often with the encouragement of Russian troops\\". Anatoly Nogovitsyn claimed that day that Russia was not prepared for withdrawal from Gori, since Russian forces had to protect an abandoned ammunition. Witnesses in Poti reported that Russian tanks had entered the town and were looting or destroying infrastructure. Russia denied that its troops were in Poti. Anatoly Nogovitsyn later said that Russians were gathering intelligence in Poti. It was reported that some of the troops occupying Zugdidi wore blue peacekeeping helmets while others wore green camouflage helmets. President Medvedev met with South Ossetian and Abkhaz leaders in Moscow on 14 August. Georgian parliament decided to withdraw Georgia from the CIS. Human Rights Watch had only confirmed the death of 44 South Ossetian civilians and accused Russia of reporting false casualty figures. Two flights delivered the U.S. humanitarian aid on a C-17 military plane to Georgia. U.S. Secretary of State Rice said that day \\"the provisional ceasefire that was agreed to really must go into place. And that means that military activities have to cease\\". Although Defence Secretary Gates accused the Russians of going \\"far beyond reasserting the autonomy of Abkhazia and South Ossetia,\\" Gates nonetheless said that there was \\"no prospect\\" of US troops being deployed.  August 15  Agence France-Presse reported that amid the ruins and tanks in the South Ossetian capital, the remaining residents shared insufficient goods and wondered why humanitarian aid promised by Russia had not arrived. Reuters reported that Russian forces had pushed to from Tbilisi, the closest during the war, and stopped in Igoeti at the same time as United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was in Tbilisi meeting President Saakashvili. According to the report, 17 APCs and 200 soldiers marched towards Igoeti. The convoy included a military ambulance, snipers, rocket-propelled grenades and initially, three helicopters. The Georgian troops and police were nearby where the Russians had stopped, but did not resist them. According to the International Herald Tribune (IHT), the move \\"opened a new security vacuum between Gori and [Igoeti], creating fresh targets\\" for \\"looters and armed gangs in uniform - many of them apparently Ossetians, Chechens and Cossacks - [who] have operated behind the army's path, ransacking villages largely vacated by fleeing civilians.\\" After about five-hour meeting with Condoleezza Rice, President Saakashvili signed an EU-brokered ceasefire. Rice in Tbilisi declared: \\"Russian forces need to leave Georgia at once. This is no longer 1968.\\" Saakashvili described Russians as \\"21st century barbarians\\". He blamed the West for provoking the conflict by not properly reacting to Russia's previous military acts and not allowing Georgia to become a NATO member as soon as possible. The Russian General Staff said at its daily news briefing on the same day that no shooting occurred in the previous 24 hours. Russian ground troops were mostly based around Gori. German Chancellor Angela Merkel met Russian president Dmitry Medvedev in Sochi. Medvedev said in Sochi that he couldn't see the people of South Ossetia and Abkhazia wishing to be still a part of Georgia and claimed not Russia, but local residents opposed international peacekeeping forces in the two regions. Amidst what the Associated Press described as \\"intense diplomacy\\" to pressure Russia to withdraw from Georgia, Interfax News Agency quoted Russian General Anatoly Nogovitsyn as saying that Poland \\"is exposing itself to a strike\\" by welcoming an American missile battery. Associated Press reported that Gori \\"is key to when ‚Äì or if ‚Äì Russia will honour the terms of a ceasefire\\". Despite earlier reports of Russian troops moving towards Kutaisi, Georgian official denied the Russian presence in Kutaisi. Human Rights Watch stated they had documented the use of cluster bombs against Georgian civilians by Russian Air Force and urged Russia not to use such banned weapons. The accusation was dismissed by the Russian Defence Ministry and one Russian official claimed that the HRW used \\"biased witnesses\\" as source of information.  August 16  The BBC reported that the Russian army entered the port of Poti on 16 August \\"at least the third time\\" since the war began. The Russian forces that were occupying Poti, as well as military bases in Gori and Senaki, that day destroyed the military bases which were based on the NATO standard and the American-made or supplied arsenal. Early on 16 August, foxholes were dug up by the Russians in Igoeti. In the afternoon, the Russian forces withdrew from their positions in Igoeti. The Russian withdrawal from Igoeti was reported by the western news agencies. The IHT noted that Russian soldiers still were in Zugdidi and Senaki in western Georgia, and that Russian armored patrol was on the road to Abasha near Kutaisi. In Poti, 16 coastal guard vessels were confiscated by the Russian military. The major Georgian east-west highway was controlled by the Russian forces by occupying the positions around Gori and the city of Senaki. The Georgian Foreign Ministry announced that Russian troops destroyed a major railway bridge in the Kaspi district responsible for bisecting Georgia from east to west and linking the hinterland to seaports on the Black Sea. Russians denied blowing up the bridge. However, the destruction of the bridge caused Azerbaijan to halt oil shipments and Armenian supply of goods was also interrupted. Dmitry Medvedev told the permanent members of the Security Council that he had signed the ceasefire document on 12 August in Moscow. The Guardian reported that South Ossetian forces had occupied undefended Akhalgori on 16 August and that one South Ossetian fighter said,\\"It will be part of an independent country within the Russian Federation.\\" It was reported that new checkpoints were set up by the Russian forces on the Tbilisi-Gori road and that a Grad multiple-rocket launcher was moving towards Tbilisi. Georgian Foreign Ministry stated that Russian forces and Abkhaz separatists had taken 13 villages and the Inguri hydropowerpower plant. After this action, the border of Abkhazia was shifted toward the Inguri River.  August 17  Richard Galpin of the BBC, who had spent the past two days travelling from Poti to Tbilisi, reported that Georgian forces \\"seemed to be surrendering control of the highway to the Russians\\". According to BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse, there was a \\"much-reduced\\" Russian military presence in Gori that day and humanitarian aid was being delivered, however Russians still controlled major entry and exit points of Gori. The Russian commander claimed that his troops remained in Gori to avoid looting and would only leave after the Georgian police was ready. Major General Vyacheslav Borisov claimed that day to have ordered Russian peacekeepers to replace Russian soldiers in Igoeti, but this was disputed by Georgia. The Times reported that Russia was occupying about a third of Georgia and that Ossetian militiamen were wearing white armbands to ease their recognition for Russians. Russian president Medvedev promised Sarkozy that Russian troops would begin withdrawal to South Ossetia on 18 August. Georgian president Saakashvili said that \\"Georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory.\\" Earlier, the residents of Zugdidi had protested against the Russian occupation. The New York Times reported that Russia had deployed SS-21 Scarab missile launchers to South Ossetia on 15 August.  August 18  Anatoly Nogovitsyn from the Russian General Staff said around noon that Russia had started to pull troops from Georgia. RIA Novosti reported that Russian military equipment was being pulled out of the South Ossetian capital Tskinvali. Four Russian armored vehicles in the village of Igoeti appeared to be moving to the village of Lamiskana, however they were resisted by Georgian police, which had made a barrier with their vehicles. The Russian general ordered his soldiers to drive over the police cars, however the Georgian policemen managed to get out of the cars before the Russians drove over their cars. Late on afternoon, Russian military units were still holding the center of Georgia and Russian military convoys were moving in and out of Gori. In western Georgia, there was no signs of a Russian withdrawal from Zugdidi by mid-afternoon, but a convoy of 12 Russian military vehicles had rolled south toward the port of Poti in the morning. Russian troops were still occupying an air base and other positions in Senaki. Russian Foreign ministry stated that according to 1999 document of the Joint Control Commission, peacekeepers were permitted to operate a \\"security corridor\\" extending about in each direction from South Ossetian boundary, thus including parts of the main Georgian east-west highway. However, Russian forces actually had never crossed into Georgia proper before the war.  August 19  The Wall Street Journal said Russian forces had seized control of Poti on the morning, which is the economically significant port. Georgian soldiers in Poti were captured by the Russian forces and taken to the base in Senaki four hours later. The Russians also captured five American jeeps. Later, American Humvees moved down the road to Abkhazia. A top Russian military official claimed that armed Georgian soldiers in Poti were driving the Humvees and were detained at a checkpoint, however the Georgians said that 21 Georgian soldiers were guarding the port from looting, and that American Humvees used in a joint exercise were packed in a container to be shipped back to the United States. An Azerbaijani news source quoted a Poti port official as saying, \\"All workers were expelled from the port [yesterday at night]\\". Prisoners of war were exchanged by Russia and Georgia. A Georgian official said that although his country exchanged five Russian servicemen for fifteen Georgians (including two civilians), Georgia suspected that Russia still held two more Georgians. The exchange took place in Igoeti and two of the exchanged Russians were pilots. Earlier, Russia had claimed that Russian troops were pulling back while Georgia was not complying with the ceasefire. NATO countries convened for an emergency summit in Brussels to find some consensuses on a response towards Russia in regard to the conflict in Georgia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov levelled accusations at NATO of being \\"unobjective and biased\\" in maintaining support for a \\"criminal regime\\" that was \\"failing.\\" Russian president Medvedev had told French president Sarkozy that the withdrawal would be complete by 21‚Äì22 August, however 500 Russian soldiers would guard South Ossetian border. The New York Times reported that Russian troops were patrolling villages in western Georgia with tanks and armored personnel carriers daily. Russians had deployed artillery along major roads between Poti and Abkhazia. Reinforced trenches for a Russian checkpoint north of Gori was being built by engineering platoon and Russian armored vehicles were overlooking Gori and Igoeti from high ground. Most of the conflict zone was reportedly in need of water and food. Georgian villagers were hiding in fear of looters. Interfax reported that the head of Russian Federal Security Service said that according to intelligence reports, Georgia planned terrorist attacks in southern Russia, and security was increased at transportation hubs, industrial plants and densely populated areas. Martin Nesirky, a spokesman for the OSCE, said that OSCE would deploy 20 international monitors in addition to 8 already present in South Ossetia, who would begin arriving on 21 August and be let in the area adjacent to South Ossetia.  August 20  The United Nations Security Council met at 16:15 EDT on 19 August to hear briefings about the situation, including brief statements of Lynn Pascoe about human rights abuses and relief shipments to the conflict area, and the promise of a permanent Russian military base in South Ossetia. The Georgian ambassador reported cases of destruction of their civilian and military infrastructure and reported a cyber attack from Russia. The Russian ambassador accused other parties of engaging in \\"propaganda\\". On 20 August, a French-drafted UN Security Council resolution was not passed because of Russian resistance and Vitaly Churkin said, \\"It's a waste of time because the process of the withdrawal of Russian forces will continue.\\" A claim was made by an official from the Poti port that the Russian military had withdrawn after blowing up a vessel and capturing military equipment. Russia reduced initial civilian casualty figures of 1,600 people for the conflict to 133 ethnic Ossetian civilians listed as dead. Russia also reduced the number of its killed military to 64, but increased the number of its wounded military to more than 300. Georgia said that 160 Georgian soldiers were killed and 300 were missing. International Criminal Court stated that it was analysing the conflict.  August 21  Russia's emergencies ministry declared in a statement, \\"A total of 17,912 people returned in the period August 12‚Äì20.\\" Russian forces still continued to occupy Gori and Igoeti. Russian Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov repeated Medvedev's claim that Russian troops would withdraw to South Ossetia by the end of 22 August. Commander of Russian land forces, General Vladimir Boldyrev, claimed that withdrawal of troops not manning the security zones to Russia would last for 10 days. Near Poti, an AP photographer and TV crew were detained by the Russian soldiers and their equipment was confiscated. The residents of Poti protested against the Russian occupation. Associated Press reported that \\"tanks, armored personnel carriers and trucks were seen moving in both directions on the road from Gori to Tskhinvali.\\" There were reports of Georgian villages being looted and burned. Conductor Valery Gergiev held the concert during the night in front of the South Ossetian parliament in Tskhinvali. American President George Bush told Georgian President Saakashvili during their phone conversation that the United States sought to end the Russian \\"siege\\" of Georgia.  August 22  Russian forces withdrew from Igoeti, and Georgian police advanced towards Gori. Colonel-general Nogovitsyn demonstrated to reporters the map of the \\"zone of responsibility\\" that would be established in Georgia after the military withdrawal. Novogitsyn commented on the Russian military presence on parts of the highway around Gori by saying that \\"if needed we reserve the right to boost these forces with units from the Russian peacekeepers‚Äô contingent\\". Russia had withdrawn most troops from Georgia by the evening to Abkhazia and South Ossetia and Georgia's main east-west highway was effectively reopened. The New York Times reported: \\"The Russian incursion into Georgia had already energized the world‚Äôs corps of military attach√©s, who have been provided a rare chance to see the Russian Army operating in the field. [...] And many Russian troops, after several years of emphasis by former President Vladimir V. Putin on developing units of volunteers and not conscripts, looked fit and alert.\\" Russia claimed that its promised troop pullout from Georgia was complete and announced that Russia would permanently maintain a large buffer zone near South Ossetia and Abkhazia. According to a White House spokesman, American President Bush and French President Sarkozy had agreed that Russia was not in compliance with the ceasefire. The Kremlin, however, said in a formal announcement on 23 August, that President Sarkozy, in a telephone conversation with Russian President Medvedev, had shown satisfaction with the Russian withdrawal.  August 23  Units of the Georgian Army returned to Gori. Russian military was pulling out from Zugdidi to Abkhazia. Russian troops left the military base in Senaki after looting it for more than a week. However, Russian checkpoints remained near Gori as well as in so-called buffer zones near the borders with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and two Russian observer posts remained near Poti. At a news conference General Anatoly Nogovitsyn insisted, \\"These patrols were envisaged in the international agreement. Poti is outside of the security zone, but that does not mean we will sit behind a fence watching them riding around in Hummers.\\" Nogovitsyn claimed that Georgia was rearming for \\"another act of aggression\\". He claimed that \\"2,100 people\\" were killed in the conflict.  August 24  With Russian forces still within the port of Poti, a US warship arrived with aid supplies in Batumi and two more warships were expected to arrive. The supplies delivered by the destroyer USS McFaul would be unloaded by a floating crane since the warship did not fit into the port. The BBC reported that \\"apart from delivering aid, the arrival of US naval personnel is undoubtedly intended to send a signal to the Russians - that America is serious about its support for Georgia.\\" Georgia stated that day that a fuel train exploded near Gori.  August 25  The Deputy Defense Minister of Abkhazia, Anatoly Zaitsev, claimed that 8,000 Georgian troops were massing at the border with Abkhazia. Abkhaz and South Ossetian leaders addressed the Russian Parliament before the vote at extraordinary sittings, which had been formally convened by separatist appeals. Both houses of the Russian Parliament passed unanimous non-binding resolutions calling on Russian President Medvedev to recognise the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The US state department said that such action would be \\"a violation of Georgian territorial integrity\\" and \\"inconsistent with international law\\". American president Bush said, \\"I call on Russia's leadership to meet its commitments and not recognise these separatist regions.\\" German, British and Italian leaders were also concerned.  August 26  Russian President Medvedev signed two Presidential decrees recognizing the Republic of Abkhazia and the Republic of South Ossetia as sovereign independent states. He authorized the drafting of treaties of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance with authorities in Sukhumi and Tskhinvali.

The base is part of the South African National Antarctic Program (SANAP) and is operated by the South African National Antarctic Expedition. The other two SANAP bases in Antarctica are located on the Gough and Marion islands.  Location  Located in the Queen Maud Land region of Eastern or Greater Antarctica, SANAE IV is on top of a distinctive flat-topped nunatak, Vesleskarvet, on the fringe of the Ahlmann Range of mountains. The base is approximately from the edge of the continent (also known as the grounding line or hinge zone) and from the edge of the ice shelf. Vesleskarvet is completely surrounded by the glacial ice sheet.  Concept  The first three SANAE research stations were located on the Fimbul Ice Shelf near to the coast, and were subject to the gradual snow burial and eventual crushing that occurs with all stations constructed in this fashion. With a vision of creating a more permanent station, SANAE IV was completed in 1997 using a design which was revolutionary at the time - a structure raised on stilts which allows snow to blow through underneath and thus limits deposition. By constructing the base near the cliffs of Vesleskarvet, the concept was advanced further: snow that would collect downwind of the base and eventually advance to cover it is instead blown off the 250 m high cliffs into the wind-scoop beyond. By virtue of this feature, the station should far exceed the short useful life of its predecessors, and the raised design has since been applied to newer stations, such as the British Antarctic Survey's new Halley Research Station and Germany's new Neumayer-Station III. The station has an orange coloured roof for better visibility from the air. The underside of the station used to be painted in a blue colour which in theory was warmed somewhat by the sun and contributed to reducing the build-up of ice underneath the station. In 1999 the South African minister of Environment and Tourism decided that this colour scheme is too reminiscent of South Africa's old flag, and ordered the orange roof to be painted bright red. Eventually, the roof remained orange but the blue underside was painted red.  Base layout  SANAE IV consists of three linked modules, each double-story, long and wide. Two smaller nearby structures contain the satellite dish used for communications and the diesel fuel bunkers. Joined end-on-end in a north‚Äìsouth orientation, the base modules are complemented on the northern end by a large raised helicopter landing area with a lifting section allowing vehicles to be brought up into the hangar for maintenance. C-block, the northernmost module, contains the large hangar, generator room, workshop, water storage, sewage processing plant, equipment stores, offices of the mechanical and electrical engineers, flight operations office, gymnasium and sauna. The neutron monitors of the North-West University are also housed in this area. B-block, the middle module, contains the kitchen, dining area, two TV lounges, bar, games room, smoker's room, library, a laundry and accommodation units. A-block, the southern module, contains the radio room and communications hub, medical facility, darkroom, various research project offices, leader's office, two physics labs, wet lab, store-rooms, another laundry, and accommodation units. The modules are linked by single-story connections that also serve as entrances with stairways down to the surface 4m below the base. Each link contains an entrance hall with two sets of doors (creating a rudimentary 'air- lock' to prevent excessive cooling when entering and exiting the base) as well as a change-room, ablution facility and electronic distribution boards.  Facilities  The base generates power using three diesel generators. Water is generated by manually shovelling snow into a snow smelter, which then melts the snow and ice and pumps water automatically into the holding tanks. Waste water and sewerage is treated within the base, with the only by-product being clean water which is then released back into the environment. All refuse is sorted, crushed and sealed in empty fuel drums for return to South Africa. Although the base is well insulated by its thick walls and triple-glazed windows, the internal areas have to be actively warmed. This is accomplished by three means. Firstly, the heat generated by the diesel generators is used to heat water for the taps and showers, which is then circulated through the base. Secondly, the same generator heat is used to heat air which is distributed by the climate control system. Thirdly, small electric wall and fan heaters are available in all indoor areas. Efforts are made to maintain the interior temperature at , although some areas (such as the hangar) do cool well below this in winter. SANAE IV has advanced communications capabilities using both satellite and radio systems. A permanent satellite connection to the SANAP headquarters in Cape Town provides three telephone lines and one fax line, and near-broadband internet access. Team members in Antarctica enjoy fast internet access which allows them to correspond with colleagues and stay in contact with friends and family.  Staff  The base is staffed and maintained year-round by a team of scientists and support personnel. Each overwintering team arrives during the summer expedition and take-over period aboard the research and logistics vessel S. A. Agulhas II, stays at the base through the austral winter and returns to South Africa at the end of the next summer season - an expedition of approximately 16 months. The summer expedition and re-supply team (excluding ship's crew) consists of 80‚Äì100 persons, and includes administrative staff, heavy vehicle operators, helicopter crew, maintenance staff, the new overwintering team and a large scientific contingent. During the brief summer (typically December/January to February/March) the base must be resupplied with food, equipment and fuel, all waste products must be removed for transport back to South Africa, the new overwintering team must receive on-site training, and scientific investigations which cannot be undertaken in the winter months (such as extended field-work) must be completed. The overwintering team remains at the base alone and isolated between the months of March and December. To be fully self-sufficient, the team typically consists of the following personnel: * An electronic engineer who doubles as communications technician, * A mechanical engineer responsible for the base systems * An electrical engineer who manages power generation and distribution * Two diesel mechanics responsible for maintenance of the diesel generators, heavy vehicles and skidoos * A meteorologist who performs both observations and forecasting * A cosmic ray physicist/engineer responsible for various research projects * A high frequency radar physicist/engineer responsible for the auroral radar projects * A third scientist responsible for the International Polar Year projects and other installations * A medical doctor An expedition leader is selected from the overwintering team prior to the departure of the expedition, and a deputy elected to serve in his place should the need arise. The expedition leader is responsible for administrative tasks and reports to the South African National Antarctic Programme headquarters in South Africa.  Research  A balloon floats into the sky as it is partially filled. SANAE IV's reason for existence is to provide a permanent year-round base for scientists undertaking research projects under the auspices of SANAP. Investigations carried-out year-round are predominantly in the physical sciences, while the summer months allow research in more diverse fields such as oceanography, biology, geology and geomorphology. Recent projects have also focused on sources of renewable energy such as solar and particularly wind power generation. There is not currently any formal medical research being undertaken. Ongoing physical science research programs includes the Antarctic Magnetospheric and Ionospheric Ground-based Observation (AMIGO), Southern Hemisphere Auroral Radar Experiment (SHARE) and Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN), Antarctic Research on Cosmic Rays (ANOKS), very low frequency (VLF) radio research and various International Polar Year projects.

Prior to that, he served 36 years as a Democratic member of the Virginia House of Delegates, and was its Speaker 1991‚Äì2000. Early life Moss received his bachelor's degree from the Virginia Polytechnic Institute. He served in the United States Army during the Korean War period, attaining the rank of first lieutenant. Afterward, he attended the University of Richmond School of Law and set up a law office in his home town of Norfolk. He practiced law until his election as city treasurer in 2001. Political career As a member of the Young Democratic Club of Norfolk, Moss was active in the 1960 presidential campaign of John F. Kennedy. House of Delegates In 1965 Moss ran for the Virginia House of Delegates as part of a racially mixed coalition of Democrats opposed to the pro-segregation state Democratic political machine of U.S. Senator Harry Flood Byrd, Sr. Running under the campaign slogan \\"get Norfolk out of the Byrd cage,\\" Moss won his first election. In 1980, when Speaker John Warren Cooke retired, House majority leader A. L. Philpott succeeded him and Moss was chosen as majority leader. Philpott, whose endorsement of Douglas Wilder's 1985 campaign for lieutenant governor helped pave the way for his election as governor in 1989, died of cancer in September 1991, shortly after announcing his retirement. Moss was elected Speaker on November 11, 1991. Moss served one term as Speaker with a Democratic governor and state senate majority. Wilder was succeeded by two Republican governors, George Allen and Jim Gilmore, and the Senate passed into Republican hands in 1997. Democrats technically held a one-vote majority in the 1997‚Äì98 session; in fact the House was split 50-50, since the one independent member, Lacey Putney, caucused with the Republicans. Finally in 1999, Republicans won outright control of the House. Moss chose not to serve as minority leader in the next session, ceding the job to the previous majority leader, C. Richard Cranwell. Post-House career Republicans had complete control of the Virginia redistricting process following the 2000 census. Moss' House district, the 88th, was eliminated (though his district number was moved to the Fredericksburg area). Most of its territory was merged with the neighboring 89th district, a majority African- American district represented by an African-American, Jerrauld Jones. Moss chose instead to run for city treasurer, replacing the retiring Joseph T. Fitzpatrick, a former state senator and state Democratic Party chair. Moss won election with 56% of the vote. Four years later, Moss faced an internal challenge for the Democratic nomination, where concerns were expressed about his age and health. Moss chose instead to run as an independent, winning the reelection with 45% of the vote in a four-way race with three African-American opponents. He died on November 26, 2015 in Greenville, South Carolina from a heart attack.Washington Post Thomas W.

Early life Meninger was born, raised and educated in the Boston area in Massachusetts. His mother Katherine was born and raised in County Kerry, Ireland, and his father John was a Quaker from Pennsylvania. After studying at St. John's Seminary in Boston, Meninger was ordained a priest in 1958 for the Diocese of Yakima in the State of Washington, where he worked on an Indian reservation and with Mexican migrant workers for six years. In 1963 he entered the Trappists at St. Joseph's Abbey in Spencer, Massachusetts, where he served in the guesthouse for 15 years, as well as teaching scripture, liturgy and patristics to the younger member of the abbey. He served as subprior, prior and dean of the junior professed monks, not yet in final vows. Centering Prayer During this time, Meninger came across a work by an English hermit of the 14th century, called the Cloud of Unknowing. It was written to help people living regular lives in the world develop and deepen their prayer lives. Meninger found that it taught contemplative prayer in a simple way available to anyone. He began to teach this method to the younger monks of the abbey and to the retreatants who had come to it for a period of spiritual reflection. In 1974 Meninger developed the workshop on Contemplative Meditation (later known as Centering Prayer) which he now teaches worldwide along with workshops on forgiveness, the Enneagram of Personality, sacred scriptures, and prayer. His method was further developed and promoted by two other monks of his abbey, Thomas Keating (his abbot at the time) and Basil Pennington. Later life In 1979 Meninger was transferred to a daughter house of Spencer Abbey, St. Benedict's Monastery in Snowmass, Colorado, where he has served as Prior, vocation director, Master of novices, and teacher of theology and scripture. He spent 3 years in Israel where he studied scripture and taught at the √âcole Biblique in Jerusalem and at the Trappist Monastery of Latrun.

The State railway locomotive  The locomotive was built in 1917 by Henschel & Sohn in Kassel under works number 15160 for the German Army's field railways. After the end of World War I the engine was sold to the Royal Bavarian State Railways (K√∂niglich Bayerische Staatsbahn). It was designated as Class Gts 2x3/3 and was given the number 996. It was employed on the Eichst√§tt‚ÄìKinding narrow gauge route. After the take over of the German state railways by the Deutsche Reichsbahn it was given the number 99 201 and classified as DRG Class 99.20. In order not to exceed the permitted axle load, the locomotive was equipped with six axles, which were grouped into two groups of three, each with its own driving gear. This compound engine was of the Mallet locomotive type. The preheater was located in front of the chimney and lay parallel to the axis of the locomotive. The engine could carry 1.5 tonnes of coal and 4.5 m2 of water. After the conversion of its home line, Eichst√§tt‚ÄìKinding, to standard gauge in 1934 the locomotive was withdrawn from service and later scrapped.  Background information to the locomotive class   Army field railway locomotives  Locomotive 99 201 was one of a total of 20 engines, that Henschel delivered to the German Army for their field railways. Several of the machines were destroyed in the war, others were abandoned abroad, for example in France. Several engines of this series were employed on the Hedjaz railway from Damascus to Medina.  Copies  After World War I Henschel produced two further copies of this class: *In 1925 locomotive 104 was built for the line from Zell im Wiesental to Todtnau run by the South German Railway Company (S√ºddeutsche Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft). This engine was sold to the Blonay‚ÄìChamby museum railway in Switzerland in 1967. *In 1928 locomotive no. 12s was delivered to the Alb valley railway. In 1934 this engine then went to the Brohl valley railway. It was scrapped there in 1957. Unlike the original German Army field railway engines, the copies were built as saturated steam locomotives.  Preserved examples  One example was in service with the Blonay‚ÄìChamby museum railway at Lake Geneva. The locomotive is currently non-operational and can be seen in the railway museum there. Mallet locomotives 413 and 414 of the Chemin de fer du Vivarais do not belong to this class. The two engines were built in the 1930s in Alsace.

It is an ecclesiastical territory in the province of Zamboanga Sibugay. It occupies an area of 4,850 square kilometers extending from the boundary of Zamboanga del Norte on the north to Olutanga Island on the south, from the town of Tungawan on the west to the town Margosatubig on the east boundaries set by Pope John Paul II himself when he decreed the separation of this ecclesiastical territory from the Archdiocese of Zamboanga on December 24, 1979. The area described above comprises the Province of Zamboanga Sibugay. The terrain is generally hilly bounded by mountains on the north and the Sibuyan Bay on the south. There are no large cities in the area; it is predominantly rural, predominantly agricultural, with rice, corn, rubber and coconut as the major crops. Of these only rubber is produced commercially. The overall economic situation of the area is very poor. Roads and facilities are inadequate. The population covered by the prelature is 581,316 of which 62 per cent are Catholics. A majority of the population are migrants from the Central Visayas area, which accounts for the predominance of the Cebuano dialect, followed by Ilonggo. These are the languages used in the Catholic liturgy. History On December 24, 1979, the Territorial Prelature of Ipil was established from the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Zamboanga The Prelature of Ipil is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Zamboanga with whom it shares much of its history of evangelization. The faith was first brought to the Zamboanga Peninsula by the Jesuit Missionaries as early as 1635. The Jesuit father took charge for many years over what was then considered mission territory. Two Jesuit priests Father Francisco Paliola and Father Alejandro Lopez lost their lives as martyrs in their efforts to win over the Muslim through diplomacy. From 1910 the whole Island of Mindanao fell under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Zamboanga. In 1933, other ecclesiastical territories were established in Mindanao, separating themselves from Zamboanga, the last of which was the Prelature of Ipil in 1979. Politically the two Zamboangas were just one province since the days of the Spanish era. Because of the many waves of migrations from the northern islands that occurred during the American era, the large province of Zamboanga was split up into two provinces in 1952. On June 21, 1980, Bishop Federico O. Escaler, SJ, was transferred from Kidapawan to Ipil. At that time there were only 9 parishes with 13 priests, all Jesuits. In 1981 Bishop Escaler invited new groups to come and work in the prelature. And they came: the Spinola Sisters and the PIME Fathers. In 1981 the parish church of Ipil became a cathedral. The years 1984 and 1985 were peak years of militarization and frequent encounters between the military and the rebels, members of the New People's Army (NPA) and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). These were also the peak years of human rights violations. In February 1985 the Bishop was kidnapped on his way to Zamboanga City. He was released after a few days, thanks to military-initiated operations. A prelature worker was also shot dead. On April 4 of 1995, Ipil was again attacked, this time by breakaway elements of the Abu Sayyaf group. The town was set on fire and razed to the ground, and people were butchered to death. Press reports called it a massacre. All that had been so laboriously built went to rubble in a matter of hours. In spite of these tragedies, the Prelature of Ipil went ahead and celebrated the fifteenth anniversary of its founding in June 1995. It was a celebration of faith and life, as manifested by the prelature's vision statement. The Prelature's Vision Statement: \\"We, the people of God of the Prelature of Ipil, believe that God is present among us and has called all the peoples to protect and celebrate life. On the other hand, we feel deeply moved by the suffering that our people have to bear due to economic poverty, political oppression and cultural disinterest of so many people. We are concerned also over the ecological devastation of our environment. In this regard we believe that we are called to become a true Church of the poor and a community of disciples of Christ as the Gospel teaches, and the Second Plenary Council of the Philippines affirms.\\" There are 19 parishes in the prelature, 431 chapels and about 1500 Basic Christian Communities at present. Serving the parishes are 30 priests, 41 religious sisters and 40 lay workers. Among its institutions are 5 Catholic schools. Among its ministries are those on Christian Formation (KRISKA), Catechetics, Family Life, Tribal Filipinos, Youth, Community-based Health Program and Social Action. On May 1, 2010, Pope Benedict XVI elevated the Prelature of Ipil to a full diocese, the 58th in the Philippines, and appointed as its first bishop Julius Sullan Tonel, who had served as its Bishop-Prelate.

History The Prelature of Isabela in Basilan was established on October 12, 1963, and comprises the whole of Basilan Province, including Isabela City, its former capital, and Lamitan City, the new capital. Bishop Jose Ma. Querexeta, CMF, was the first bishop‚àíprelate of Isabela. During his term, he established parishes for the Catholics as well as schools for both Muslims and Christians. The Mindanao War in the 1970s shattered the prelature's dream of Christians and Muslims living peacefully side by side. This was aggravated by the kidnapping of a Spanish Claretian priest in 1987 who had devoted many years of his priestly life in Basilan attending to the spiritual needs of Christians and the economic needs of the poorer Muslims. Bishop Romulo dela Cruz became the Prelate Ordinary of Basilan in 1989 upon the retirement of Bishop Querexeta. It was during Dela Cruz‚Ä≤s term as a bishop when Islamic Fundamentalism was on the rise and the Abu Sayyaf, a violent fundamentalist group of armed adherents, came into existence. One Franciscan brother and one Claretian priest were kidnapped in 1992 and 1993 respectively. Not even the local clergy was spared. Father Cirilo Nacorda was kidnapped on June 8, 1994, and was released three months later, but not before fifteen of his companions were killed and the remaining 25 captives, mostly teachers and health workers, were finally released. Kidnapping remains a genuine threat for church workers and priests in Basilan. But admirably, not a single one of them, including the lay workers, are intimidated by it, or retreat because of fear. The prelature personnel, from the lay workers up to the bishop himself, are one in standing firm on no ransom for kidnapping. Perhaps because of the semblance of \\"persecution\\" of Christians, who are very often the victims of the present instability in Basilan, there is also perceived a unity and solidarity among them. Lay people are exceptionally and spiritually alive, and are always willing to work and get involved. The impending establishment of a Provisional Government in Mindanao under the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) hangs like a sword of Damocles over Basilan Christians who have no wish to be part of the Provisional Government.http://www.cbcponline.net/isabela/ Vision and Mission of the Prelature For its vision, the church in Basilan hopes to proclaim a Christian understanding of the human person, of society, and the common good of all the people of Basilan, considering its divergent cultures, religions and ideologies. For its mission it aims to promote a \\"new spirituality\\" that unites people in faith and in the Lord, in justice and charity towards neighbor, in a personal conversion that could bring about a change in societal structures. It is the perception of the church in Basilan that the renewal of a vision and a mission, as initiated by the Plenary Council of the Philippines II, is not entirely new for Basilan Christians because of their minority situation. Rather it is a question of deepening this renewal in order to strengthen one's own evangelization, to be able to pass this on to one's neighbor, be he Muslim or Christian.http://www.cbcponline.net/isabela/ Prelates of Isabela (Roman rite) * Bishop Jos√© Mar√≠a Querejeta Mendiz√°bal, C.M.F.

The story is part of a compilation of short stories in the book Lonesome Places. Published in 1962, by Arkham House Publishing, \\"The Lonesome Place\\" tells the story of two young boys terrorized by a mysterious creature who they believe lives in an abandoned grain elevator in their small town. Plot The Lonesome Place is told through the eyes of Steve, the narrator, and his best friend, Johnny Newell. The two boys are very scared of the dark and they believe that there is something living in the lonesome place. The lonesome place is an old grain elevator surrounded by tall trees and many piles of wood from the lumber yard that surrounds it. The story begins with the narrator's Mother asking her son to run errands for her before dinner at twilight. In order for the boy to get to the local grocery shop he needs to cross through the old lumber yard and past the lonesome place. At first sight, the lumber yard seems harmless enough, but after the sun goes down and the stars peep out into the sky the lumber yard becomes a place where shadows lurk and screams are drowned in darkness and never heard again. In the book it says Johnny and the narrator tend to run by the lonesome place when unable to avoid it because of the scary creature that they believe lives there. Both have their own hair- raising stories of going past the lumber yard and grain elevator at night. Johnny tells the narrator how the creature almost got him the night before, showing his ripped shirt as evidence of his close escape; the narrator returns with a tale of how he heard it knock over some lumber during his own trip through. The narrator has never seen the creature, but can feel its presence. When the boys run past the dark place their hearts race and their imagination runs wild. As they compare their experiences they conjure up a monster with big clawed feet, scales, a long tail and yet has no face. This creature waits for fearful children on which to prey. The creature is also able to climb the tree and lie in the trees. The creature also is known to lay by the lumber but the children can‚Äôt see the creature because it‚Äôs so dark in The Lonesome place. When the grain elevator is torn down and the boys are all grown up and become less fearful of the Lonesome Place, the monster waits for other fearful boys and girls in the dark. Many of the boys take their dates here because the lumber yard is so creepy for the girls. When Bobby Jeffers is killed by being mauled by some type of animal, the narrator and Johnny believe they are responsible for the boy's death, since they had left that conjured monster free to feed on another child's fear. They felt that they should have done something about it when they were younger. Now that Bobby is dead the boys feel guilt for creating the monster out of their own fears.

It has about 1,900 inhabitants. History The first mention of the locality in the documents is from 1316. The village was raised to a town in 1514 and was mentioned in historical sources as the property of the knights Ctibor and Old≈ôich. The small stronghold from this time was inhabited until 1733. From the 16th century the counts of Haimhausen had authority in Plan√°. A catastrophic fire in the 18th century burnt down the ancient church of the city in the year 1733 and was replaced in the years 1748‚Äì1754 by the new baroque church along with vicarage. The vicarage was dedicated to John the Baptist. In 1930 the statistic for religious affinity was counted with 1698 catholic and 37 non-Catholics. In 1734 a small baroque castle was begun, a dipterous storied building with Mansard roof and 1906 another small castle. The town is well known for the oldest brewery in the west-Bohemian region, which is named Chodovar. The first written reference to the brewery is from 1573, ownership was initially with the Adels family von Schlick. The brewery in 1634 already produced \\"1920 pailful\\", some 1173 litres. The brewery is best known today for its \\"Original Beer Spa\\". Guests can soak in a dark lager/mineral water blend in copper tubs. The beer soak spa treatment is said to have medicinal benefits. After a fire in 1861, the owners of the time left the Count of Berchem-Haimhausen the old stone basement which still today preserves the brewery, which belonged to the Count of Berchem- Haimhausen to the time of the World War II. Today the Czech beer \\"Chodovar\\" comes from the brewery, which is now privately owned, in Chodov√° Plan√°. Evidence of earlier brewing activities in the town exist, such as the historic Lager basement from the 14th century, which was hewn from granite and in the past used to brew special Lager beer. There is a small brewery museum in one part of the brewery basement and a restaurant. Present The town has a primary school and a post office as well as the sports club TJ Slavoj Chodov√° Plan√°.

Description After the ceremonies of foundation, the site was platted and occupied on March 27, of the same year when the first 13 plots of land were demarcated and distributed among some of the earliest settlers. Captain Ant√∫nez Pacheco also appointed its first mayor, Rafael Echeverria, and the members of its first city council or Cabildo. The plans for the layout of the city had been sent to, and received approval from, the royal courts in Spain the preceding year. Work on its construction commenced with the appointment of the new council and the religious destinies of the city were trusted to the Capuchin Order. San Carlos del Zulia grew to become an important livestock and food distribution center for the northern Andean region and Apure State. Its growth joined together a few neighboring populations like Santa B√°rbara del Zulia, forming a single urban center which now includes various industries: from sawmills to meat packing. Modern-day San Carlos is a medium size city with a population of over 55,000 people.Data for San Carlos del Zulia. Geonames.org. Retrieved on 3 February 2019. It is served by an airport, a thermal power station, and several educational and medical facilities. Natural sites in the area include: the Catatumbo, and Escalante rivers; the bogs of San Miguel de Agua Clara and Valderrama, and the Birimbay lagoon. The festival of Our Lady of Carmen takes every year place on July 16 and those of Santa B√°rbara and San Carlos on November 4.

Valerius Soranus is also credited with a little-recognized literary innovation: Pliny the Elder says he was the first writer to provide a table of contents to help readers navigate a long work.Pliny the Elder, preface 33, Historia naturalis; John Henderson, ‚ÄúKnowing Someone Through Their Books: Pliny on Uncle Pliny (Epistles 3.5),‚Äù Classical Philology 97 (2002), p. 275. Life and political career Valerius Soranus was admired for his learning by Cicero (depicted anachronistically in a 16th-century edition of his letters) Cicero has an interlocutor in his De oratore praise Valerius Soranus as ‚Äúmost cultured of all who wear the toga,‚ÄùMarcus Tullius Cicero, De oratore 3.43: litteratissimum togatorum omnium. and Cicero lists him and his brother Decimus among an educated elite of socii et Latini;Marcus Tullius Cicero, Brutus 169. that is, those who came from allied polities on the Italian peninsula rather than from Rome, and those whose legal status was defined by Latin right rather than full Roman citizenship. The municipality of Sora was near Cicero's native Arpinum, and he refers to the Valerii Sorani as his friends and neighbors.Cicero, Brutus 169: vicini et familiares mei; Elizabeth Rawson, Intellectual Life in the Late Roman Republic (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), p. 34. Soranus was also a friend of Varro and is mentioned more than once in that scholar's multi-volume work on the Latin language.Marcus Terentius Varro, De lingua latina 7.31, 7.65, 10.70; Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae 2.10.3; Edward Courtney, The Fragmentary Latin Poets (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993), p. 65. The son of Q. Valerius Soranus is thought to have been the Quintus Valerius Orca who was praetor in 57 BC.Giovanni Niccolini, I fasti dei tribuni della plebe (Milan 1934), pp. 430‚Äì431. Orca had worked for Cicero's return to public lifeMarcus Tullius Cicero, Post reditum in senatu 23. and is among Cicero's correspondents in the Epistulae ad familiares (Letters to Friends and Family).Marcus Tullius Cicero, Epistulae ad familiares 13.4 (= 318 in the chronological edition of Shackleton Bailey), 13.5 (= 319 SB), 13.6 (= 57 SB), 13.6a (= 58 SB); discussion in John Pairman Brown, Israel and Hellas: Sacred Institutions and Roman Counterparts, vol. 2 (Berlin and New York: Walter de Gruyter, 1995), pp. 248‚Äì249. Cicero presents the Valerii brothers of Sora as well schooled in Greek and Latin literature, but less admirable for their speaking ability.Cicero, Brutus 169: non tam in dicendo admirabilis quam doctus et Graecis litteris et Latinis. As Italians, they would have been lacking to Cicero's ears in the smooth sophistication (urbanitas) and faultless pronunciation of the best native Roman orators.Edwin S. Ramage, ‚ÄúCicero on Extra-Roman Speech,‚Äù Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association 92 (1961) 481‚Äì494, especially pp. 487‚Äì488. This attitude of social exclusivity may account for why Valerius Soranus, whose scholarly interests and friendships might otherwise suggest a conservative temperament, would have found his place in the civil wars of the 80s on the side of the popularist Marius rather than that of the patrician Sulla.John Pairman Brown, Israel and Hellas, vol. 2 (Berlin 1995), pp. 249‚Äì250. It might also be noted that Cicero's expression of this attitude is double-edged: like Marius and the Valerii Sorani, he was also a man from a municipium, and had to overcome the same obstructing biases that he adopts and expresses.Elizabeth Rawson, Intellectual Life in the Late Roman Republic (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), p. 34 et passim. In 82 BC, the year of his death, Valerius Soranus was or had been a tribune of the people (tribunus plebis), a political office open only to those of plebeian rather than patrician birth. Execution The fullest account of the infamous death of Valerius Soranus is given by Servius, who says he was executed for revealing the secret name of Rome:Matthias Klinghardt discusses the religious case in \\"Prayer Formularies for Public Recitation: Their Use and Function in Ancient Religion,\\" Numen 46 (1999), pp. 43‚Äì45; see also H.S. Versnel, ‚ÄúA Parody on Hymns in Martial V 24 and Some Trinitarian Problems,‚Äù Mnemosyne 27 (1974), p. 374, especially note 44. Servius's account presents several difficulties. Crucifixion was a punishment generally reserved for slaves in the Late Republic;Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, entry on \\"Crux,\\" Bill Thayer's LacusCurtius edition; Elizabeth Rawson, \\"Sallust on the Eighties?\\", Classical Quarterly 37 (1987), pp. 175‚Äì176; K.M. Coleman, \\"Fatal Charades: Roman Executions Staged as Mythological Enactments,\\" Journal of Roman Studies 80 (1990), p. 53 et passim; for full discussion, see M. Hengel, Crucifixion in the Ancient World (London 1977), especially \\"Crucifixion and Roman Citizens\\" and \\"The 'Slaves' Punishment,\\" chapters 6 and 8. Valerius Maximus, a historian in the early Principate, reckoned that the punishment should not be inflicted on those of Roman blood even when they \\"deserved\\" it.Valerius Maximus, 2.7.12. Moreover, a tribune's person was by law sacrosanct.\\"Tribune\\" at Livius.org; fuller discussion of the tribunate at Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, \\"Tribunus,\\" Bill Thayer's LacusCurtius edition.. Finally, it is unclear whether the ten tribunes should possess the knowledge of Rome's secret name,‚ÄúThis name and the name of the tutelary deity of Rome had to be handed down from one generation of Roman priests and magistrates to the succeeding one‚Äù: Jerzy Linderski, \\"The Augural Law,\\" Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II 16.3 (1986), p. 2255, note 424. The story of Valerius Soranus, Linderski assumes, indicates that tribunes knew the name; the reasoning may be circular. or in what manner Soranus would have publicized it. Among sources earlier than Servius, both Pliny the Elder and Plutarch note that Valerius Soranus was punished for this violation.Pliny the Elder, Historia naturalis 3.65; Plutarch, Roman Questions 61. The late antique grammarian Solinus (1.4) also reports that Valerius Soranus was killed for profaning the name of Rome, connecting the act to the Roman goddess Angerona, whose cult statue depicted her with a sealed mouth. It has been suggested that the name was revealed in his one work for which a title is known, the Epoptides. The title, if interpreted as it sometimes is to mean \\"tutelary deities,\\" offers an apt context.Thomas K√∂ves-Zulauf, \\"Die ·ºòœÄœåœÄœÑŒπŒ¥ŒµœÇ des Valerius Soranus,\\" Rheinisches Museum 113 (1970) 323-358. \\"Tutelary deities\\" is not the universal translation: see discussion under Literary Works. But elsewhere Servius ‚Äî so too Macrobius ‚Äî implies that the name remained unrecorded.Servius, Commentary on the Aeneid 1.277; Macrobius, Saturnalia 3.9; John Pairman Brown, Israel and Hellas, vol. 2 (Berlin 1995), p. 250. The ancient sources on the violation make a distinction without, in the outcome for Soranus, a difference; some say the arcanum not to be revealed was the secret name of Rome, and others that of Rome's tutelary deity, see L'identit√† segreta della divinit√† tutelare di Roma. Un riesame dell' affaire Sorano. Roma, Settimo Sigillo, 2011. Quintus Valerius Soranus has been identified with the Q. Valerius, described as philologos and philomathes (‚Äúa lover of literature and learning‚Äù),Plutarch, Life of Pompey 10.4: œÜŒπŒªœåŒªŒøŒ≥ŒøœÇ ·ºÄŒΩ·Ω¥œÅ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÜŒπŒªŒøŒºŒ±Œ∏ŒÆœÇ. whom Plutarch says was a supporter of Marius. This man was put to death by Pompey in Sicily,Conrad Cichorius, \\"Zur Lebensgeschichte des Valerius Soranus,\\" Hermes 41 (1906), p. 59; T.R.S. Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, vol. 2, 99 B.C.‚Äì31 B.C. (New York: American Philological Association, 1952), p. 68; Edward Courtney, The Fragmentary Latin Poets (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993), p. 65. where he would have accompanied Carbo, the consular colleague of the recently murdered Cinna. Carbo was executed by Pompey.J√∂rg R√ºpke, Religion of the Romans, translated and edited by Richard Gordon (Cambridge: Polity, 2007) p. 133. In 1906, Conrad Cichorius published an articleConrad Cichorius, \\"Zur Lebensgeschichte des Valerius Soranus,\\" Hermes 41 (1906) 59‚Äì68; English abstract in American Journal of Philology 28 (1907) 468. that organized the available evidence for the life of Valerius Soranus and argued that his execution was a result of the Sullan proscription in 82. The view of his death as politically motivated has prevailed among modern scholars: But if Varro originated the story, his reasons are hard to tease out of the roiled politics of the Late Republic. Although Varro was the friend of Valerius Soranus, in the civil war of the 40s he was on the side of the Pompeians; Caesar, however, not only pardoned him, but gave him significant appointments.For the development of the story of Valerius Soranus as a cautionary tale, see Trevor Murphy, ‚ÄúPrivileged Knowledge: Valerius Soranus and the Secret Name of Rome,‚Äù in Rituals in Ink: A Conference on Religion and Literary Production in Ancient Rome (Stuttgart 2004), pp. 127‚Äì137. The biases of the contemporary sources were not lost on Plutarch in his account of the killing:Elizabeth Rawson, Intellectual Life in the Late Roman Republic (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), p. 105. Speaking the name could be construed as a political protest and also an act of treason, as the revelation would expose the tutelary deity and leave the city unprotected.John Pairman Brown, Israel and Hellas, vol. 2 (Berlin 1995), p. 250, citing Luigi Alfonsi, \\"L'importanza politico-religiosa della 'enunciazione' de Valerio Sorano,\\" Epigraphica 10 (1948) 81‚Äì89. This belief rests on the power of utterance to \\"call forth\\" the deity (evocatio), so that enemies in possession of the true and secret name could divert the divine protection to themselves.Pliny says that the Romans practiced evocatio when they laid siege to a city, with the priests calling out the foreign god and promising him a greater cult among them (Historia naturalis 28.18). Macrobius even provides the charm of evocation used against Carthage (Saturnalia 3.9). The secrecy surrounding prayer formularies, particularly the correct names of gods, was characteristic also of Judaism, Egyptian syncretistic religion, mystery religions, and later Christianity. See Matthias Klinghardt, ‚ÄúPrayer Formularies for Public Recitation: Their Use and Function in Ancient Religion,‚Äù Numen 46 (1999) 1‚Äì52, pp. 43‚Äì44 on this case; also article on \\"Magic and Religion: The Name of God.\\" The intellectual historian of the Republic Elizabeth Rawson ventured cautiously that Soranus's \\"motive remains unclear, but may have been political.\\"Elizabeth Rawson, Intellectual Life in the Late Roman Republic (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), p. 300, note 12. More vigorous is the view of Luigi Alfonsi, who argued that Soranus revealed the name deliberately so that the Italian municipalities could appropriate it and break Rome's monopoly of power.Luigi Alfonsi, \\"L'importanza politico-religiosa della enunciazione di Valerio Sorano (a proposito di CIL I¬≤ 337).\\" Epigraphica 10 (1948) 81-89. Another interpretation of these events, worth noting despite its fictional context, is that of historical novelist Colleen McCullough, who melds political and religious motives in a psychological characterization. In Fortune's Favorites, McCullough's Soranus ‚Äúscreams aloud‚Äù the arcane name because the atrocities committed during the civil war had rendered Rome unworthy of divine protection: Literary works The single couplet that survives from Valerius Soranus's vast work as a poet, grammarian, and antiquarian is quoted by St. Augustine in the De civitate Dei (7.9) to support his view that the tutelary deity of Rome was the Capitoline Jupiter:Arthur Bernard Cook, ‚ÄúThe European Sky-God III: The Italians,‚Äù Folklore 16 (1905), p. 299. > Iuppiter omnipotens regum rerumque deumque progenitor genetrixque deum, deus > unus et omnes ‚Ä¶ The syntax poses difficulties in attempts at translation, and there may be some corruption of the text. It seems to say something like \\"Jupiter All- powerful, of kings and the material world and of gods the Father (progenitor), the Mother (genetrix) of gods, God that is One and All ‚Ä¶ .\\" Augustine says that his source for the quotation is a work on religion (now lost) by Varro, with whose conception of deity Augustine argues throughout Book 7 of the De civitate Dei. The view of Varro, and presumably of Soranus, was that Jupiter represents the whole universe which emits and receives seeds (semina), encompassing the generative powers of Earth the Mother as well as Sky the Father.Robert M. Grant, review of Varros Logistoricus √ºber die G√∂tterverehrung (\\"Curio de cultu deorum\\"), dissertation by Burkhart Cardauns (W√ºrzburg 1960) in Classical Philology 57 (1962), p. 140; Elizabeth Rawson, Intellectual Life in the Late Roman Republic (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), p. 300, especially note 12; Jaime Alvar, \\"Mat√©riaux pour l'√©tude de la formule sive deus, sive dea,\\" Numen 32 (1985), pp. 259‚Äì260. This unitarianism is a Stoic concept, and Soranus is usually counted among the Stoics of Rome, perhaps of the contemporary school of Panaetius.Eduard Zeller, A History of Eclecticism in Greek 'Philos', translated by S.F. Alleyne (Kessinger, 2006, originally published 1883), p. 74; Michael von Albrecht et al., A History of Roman Literature: From Livius Andronicus to Boethius, vol. 1 (Brill, 1997), p. 504, translated from Geschichte der r√∂mischen Literatur: von Andronicus bis Boethius (1992). The unity of opposites in deity, including divine androgyny, is also characteristic of Orphic doctrine, which may have impressed itself on Stoicism.Edward Courtney, The Fragmentary Latin Poets (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993), pp. 66‚Äì68; Attilio Mastrocinque, \\"Creating One's Own Religion: Intellectual Choices,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 382, pointing out that the Hymn to Zeus of Cleanthes presents a similar view of the god, and that Laevius, a likely contemporary of Valerius Soranus, held that Venus was both female and male (according to Macrobius, Saturnalia 3.8.3). Marcello De Martino, in L'identit√† segreta della divinit√† tutelare di Roma. Un riesame dell' affaire Sorano. Roma, Settimo Sigillo, 2011, believes that Sorano revealed the name of Roman tutelar deity, who was androgynous. The couplet may or may not come from the Epoptides. The title is mentioned only in Pliny, and none of the known fragments of Soranus can be attributed to this large-scale work with certainty.Nicholas Horsfall, ‚ÄúRoman Religion and Related Topics,‚Äù review of Thomas K√∂ves-Zulauf, Kleine Schriften (Heidelberg 1988), Classical Review 41 (1991) 120-122. Soranus's innovation in providing a table of contentsAn innovation admired by Pliny the Elder, preface 33, Historia naturalis. ‚Äî most likely a list of capita rerum (\\"subject headings\\") at the beginning ‚Äî suggests that the Epoptides was an encyclopedic or compendious prose work.Elizabeth Rawson, Intellectual Life in the Late Roman Republic (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), p. 51; John Henderson, ‚ÄúKnowing Someone Through Their Books: Pliny on Uncle Pliny (Epistles 3.5),‚Äù Classical Philology 97 (2002), p. 275. Alternatively, the Epoptides may have been a long didactic poem. Soranus is known to have written didactic poetry and is likely to have been an influence when Lucretius chose verse as his medium for philosophical subject matter.C. Joachim Classen, ‚ÄúPoetry and Rhetoric in Lucretius,‚Äù Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association 99 (1968), p. 115; \\"Lucretius and Callimachus, \\" in Lucretius, edited by Monica R. Gale, Oxford Readings in Classical Studies (Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 329. The most extensive argument regarding the Epoptides is that of Thomas K√∂ves-Zulauf.Nicholas Horsfall called the 33-page essay on a non-extant work \\"something of a tour de force,\\" in ‚ÄúRoman Religion and Related Topics,‚Äù Classical Review 41 (1991) 120-122. Much of what can be conjectured about the work derives from the interpretation of its title. The Greek verb ·ºêœÄŒøœÄœÑŒµœçœâ (epopteuo) has the basic meaning of \\"to watch, oversee\\" but also \\"to become an ·ºêœÄœåœÄœÑŒ∑œÇ (epoptes, \\"initiate,\\" feminine epoptis and plural epoptides), the highest grade of initiate at the Eleusinian mysteries.Liddell and Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1843, 1985 printing), entry on ·ºêœÄŒøœÄœÑŒµŒØŒ± and related words, p. 676; Trevor Murphy, ‚ÄúPrivileged Knowledge: Valerius Soranus and the Secret Name of Rome,‚Äù in Rituals in Ink (Stuttgart 2004), p. 133. K√∂ves-Zulauf argued that Soranus's Epoptides was an extended treatment of mystery religions, and the title is sometimes translated into German as Mystikerinen. The classicist and mythographer H.J. Rose, on the contrary, insisted that the Epoptides had nothing to do with initiates.H.J. Rose, ‚ÄúLatin Literature for Italian Children,‚Äù Classical Review 51 (1937) p. 229. Elizabeth Rawson held with Initiated Women;Elizabeth Rawson, Intellectual Life in the Late Roman Republic (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), p. 34, note 85. the Loeb Classical Library offers Lady Initiates;H. Rackham's translation of Pliny's Natural History (Harvard University Press, 1991). Nicholas Horsfall is satisfied with The Watchers.Nicholas Horsfall, noting that the word's only other occurrence in Latin is from Cornutus, in ‚ÄúRoman Religion and Related Topics,‚Äù Classical Review 41 (1991) 120-122. K√∂ves-Zulauf maintains that the epoptides of the title represent the Stoic conception of female daimones who are guardians of humanity, such as the Hours (Horae) and the Graces (Charites). Soranus integrates this concept, he says, with the Tutelae, ancient Italic protective spirits. The crime of Soranus was thus to reveal in this work the name of the Tutela charged with protecting Rome. Works of later Roman grammarians suggest that Soranus took an interest in etymologyFor instance, Aulus Gellius, citing Varro, notes that Valerius Soranus thought the Old Latin word flavisa referred to the same object as the Greek-derived word thesaurus 'treasure trove', and suggested that the Latin word derived from the flata pecunia, that is 'minted money', stored there (Attic Nights 2.10 = Varro, fragment 228 in Funaioli Grammaticae Romanae Fragmenta). Roman antiquarians often used etymology to investigate the history of objects and institutions. and other linguistic matters.Varro, De lingua latina 7.31 and 10.70 Annotated bibliography * Alfonsi, L. \\"L'importanza politico-religiosa della enunciazione di Valerio Sorano (a proposito di CIL I¬≤ 337).\\" Epigraphica 10 (1948) 81-89.

He was born in Kansas, United States. Career Price was an actor whose artistic career spanned four different decades, from silents through talkies to the advent of color. He debuted in the silent movie Your Best Friend (William Nigh, 1922), sharing starring duties with Vera Gordon and Harry Benham.Your Best Friend (1922) at IMDb After that, he became a familiar figure, wearing either cowboy rustler outfits or gangster nice suits, particularly in the cliffhanger serials of the 1930s through the early 1950s. Usually, he served as the assistant or second-in-command for the brains heavy. He usually wore workmanlike duds, did the physical labor, and often had more brawn than morality. Thus, Price went from one chapter to the next trying desperately to kill the hero with fists, knives, guns, bombs or whatever else happened to be handy at the time. Nevertheless, he was another of these loyal henchmen who always seemed to break down and turn into a gutless weasel and outright coward when confronted by the hero. Eventually, Price was simply a doctor, barkeep, native, reporter, prosecutor, banker, chemist, reporter, psychotic or nobility member, appearing in about 100 westerns and 39 serials. His flair for comedy also was well represented in the film Road to Morocco, as the blithering idiot in the opening bazaar scene, as well in The Three Stooges films Punchy Cowpunchers, Dopey Dicks and Studio Stoops. He also had at least 18 dialogue director credits for Lippert Studios.imdb.com Death Price died of a heart attack in Garden Grove, California at age 62. He was buried in Angelus- Rosedale Cemetery.

The Venomous Reptiles of the Western Hemisphere. 2 volumes. Comstock Publishing Associates, Ithaca and London. 870 pp. 1500 plates. . Bothrops punctatus is a venomous pitviper species found in South America and Panama. No subspecies are currently recognized. Description Adults commonly grow to more than 100 cm in length and may exceed 150 cm. The shape of the body and long tail suggest that it is semiarboreal. The head is long and lance-shaped and the fangs exceptionally long. The scalation includes 25-29 rows of dorsal scales, 186-211/191-213 ventral scales in males/females and 70-95/80-90 paired subcaudal scales in males/females. The tail ends in a long rounded spine that may turn upwards slightly at the tip. On the head there are 6-9 intersupraocular scales, 7-9 supralabial scales, the second of which contacts the prelacunal, and 11-12 sublabial scales. The color pattern consists of a pale brown to greenish tan ground color overlaid with 16-22 pairs of darker brown paravertabral blotches that have pale edges. Some of these blotches coalesce dorsally. These blotches are offset by a row of lateral blotches that create a semibanded appearance. Below this is a third series of dark blotches, alternated with lighter spots, that extends down onto the ventral scales. The belly is cream to pale tan with brown spots. A dark brown cheek stripe is present that is darkest along the outer edges where it is narrowly bordered by a lighter color that can sometimes be orange or yellow. Geographic range Found from the Dari√©n of Panama along the Pacific slope of Colombia and Ecuador to extreme northern Peru. The type locality given is \\"Las Monta√±as del Dagua\\" (Colombia). Habitat Occurs in tropical moist and wet forest, subtropical moist and wet forest, and in montane wet forest. Venom Based on its size, this snake is probably capable of delivering a fatal bite. Although it does not seem to be common anywhere, Ayerbe (1990) states that, in the regions where it occurs, it is the most dangerous species together with the common lancehead, Bothrops atrox. Angel-Mej√≠a (1987) mentions a bite victim who was treated in Medell√≠n for acute renal failure. Taxonomy Campbell & Lamar (2004) re-classified this species, referring to it as Bothrops punctatus.

The Museum is located on the center square of downtown Asheville, 2 South Pack Square at Pack Place.http://www.ashevilleart.org The official Asheville Art Museum website The Asheville Art Museum presents exhibitions and public programs based on its permanent collection of 20th and 21st century American art. The Museum features regional and national artists through special exhibitions, and showcases works of significance to Western North Carolina‚Äôs cultural heritage including Studio Craft, Black Mountain College and Cherokee artists. Educational programs for children and adults are also offered.  History  Incorporated in 1948, the original home was a three-room building on Charlotte Street, once the land sales office of E.W. Grove, developer of the Grove Park Inn. By 1950, the Museum began acquiring a permanent collection. Quickly, the collection outgrew its home, and the Museum moved to donated space on the 15th floor of the Northwest Bank, now the BB&T; building. Forced to move in 1970, the Museum purchased property in the Montford Area Historic District of Asheville. A first full-time Director was hired, and exhibitions became more regional in scope. Programming and attendance expanded, but the aging 40-year- old building presented problems. When plans for the Asheville Civic Center were announced in 1972, the Museum Board accepted an invitation to be one of the three cultural agencies in the center. In 1976, the Museum opened a facility in the Civic Center. In 1984, the Asheville Art Museum became one of few of its size to be accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. Reflections on Unity is the first public art installation in the plaza In 1992, the Museum opened in a 1925 Italian Renaissance style building with contemporary additions that was once a library. That facility includes of space at Pack Place in downtown Asheville.

It carried Van Wyck Lane over Claverack Creek, but is now closed to all traffic, even pedestrians. It is \\"a structure of outstanding importance to the history of American engineering and transportation technology.\\" Specifically designed by John D. Hutchinson, the bridge employs the basic design of Squire Whipple. It is the only extant double-span Whipple bowstring truss bridge in the U.S. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Since then its wooden deck has deteriorated to the point where it cannot be used even by pedestrians, and it has been closed. Structure The bridge is located in a quiet residential area where houses, some dating to the early 19th century like the nearby Jacob P. Mesick House, are built on large lots. Many tall trees grow in the area, giving it a wooded feel. The creek, a tributary of the Hudson River to the west, is shallow yet wide here. It is east of NY 23/9H, the main north-south route through the Claverack area. Structurally, the bridge is a bowstring tied arch with two separate yet identical spans supported by end abutments and a center pier of mortared cut limestone blocks. Its lower chord, wrought iron spans between cast iron connecting blocks, is long, wide and above water level. Its upper chords are segmental arches of nine tangential iron castings with their bearing surfaces joined at each panel point. They bear the legend \\"J. D. Hutchinson, Builder, Troy, N.Y., 1870\\". Iron floor beams are suspended from the top chord by vertical round threaded iron rods similar to those that form the diagonal crosses and braces of the truss web. Wood stringers bolted to the iron beams run the length of the spans, and more iron rods cross-brace them. The deck itself consists of wooden planks laid across the stringers and braces. Guard rails on either side protect the trusses. History It is possible that the state may have built the bridge. In 1870, Van Wyck Lane was part of the Albany Post Road and the major route through Claverack. Whipple's iron-truss designs had been adopted as the standard bridge type on the Erie Canal; the state may well have decided to use them on highways as well. Builder John D. Hutchinson's father had also built 35 of the canal bridges. It took its name from William Shaw, a nearby property owner. In 1931 the current routes 23 and 9H were constructed, diverting traffic away from the bridge. It remained in use, with a load limit of 4 tons (3.6 metric tons) through at least 1988. Since then it has been closed to all traffic due to its deteriorated deck. Chainlink fences block the approaches, and tree branches have fallen across the bridge. As of 2011, a new administration in the town has recognized the historic importance of this bridge. Weeds have been cleared, and the town is seeking funding to allow the bridge to be restored and reopened for pedestrian use. As of 2012, the funding has fallen through, and the bridge's fate hangs, literally, in the balance.

It is based on a formulation of the algebraic equations of Boolean algebra, and is also an example of what Xenakis called symbolic music. Herma was the composer's first major work for piano. It was composed after a visit to Japan in 1961, where Xenakis befriended pianist and composer Yuji Takahashi. Xenakis completed the piece upon his return to Paris and dedicated it to Takahashi, who premi√®red the piece on February 2, 1962. The pianist's impression of that concert was that the piece \\"made some excited and wonder, others feel painful\\" . Boolean algebra is the main mathematical principle behind Herma . Xenakis defines several pitch sets and proceeds to apply various logical operations to them. The results are incorporated into music by using successions and combinations of various sets. Stochastic procedures are used to select the order and place of notes within each set .

Everhardt (born 1934) was the ninth Director of the US National Park Service (NPS). He began his NPS career as an engineer in 1957 and rose to the superintendency of Grand Teton National Park in 1972. Favorable notice there propelled him to the directorship in January 1975. As director he oversaw a great increase in park development and interpretive programming for the Bicentennial of the American Revolution. The return of an NPS careerist to the job was much applauded by park employees and supporters, but Everhardt's leadership fell short of expectations, and the new Carter administration returned him to the field as Blue Ridge Parkway's superintendent in May 1977. Biography Everhardt took a civil engineering degree at North Carolina State University, served as an Army officer, and became a NPS engineer. As Director (1975‚Äì77), he led the NPS through the implementation of the United States Bicentennial observance. The NPS conducted activities at 250 sites coast-to-coast. Everhardt pushed wilderness designation and hailed a Presidential proposal for a $1.5 billion Bicentennial Land Heritage Program. During his Directorship, a policy council was created, which produced management objectives for the Service. Other firsts were the first national symposium on urban recreation; the first national conference on scientific research; the first Native crafts sales program in parks and the first international park publication, PARKS.65th Anniversary, National Park Service, August 25, 1981. The Everhardt years were short, and consumed by the Bicentennal of the United States. During these years, the service was expanding its workforce. The number of individuals interested in positions far exceeded the jobs available. Professional skills were becoming more extensive and the need for specialists was evident.Everhart, William C.; The National Park Service; Praeger Publishers; New York, 1972. In his book, The National Park Service, Everhardt laid out the variety of skills needed to successfully operate a national park. No longer was the Park Ranger to be a multi-talented individual. New positions were being defined covering many of the jobs previously done by the park ranger. The new service would include; fire technicians, search and rescue specialists, law enforcement specialists, museum technicians, exhibit designers, film production people and many other skills once done by the park ranger.

It required four AA alkaline batteries to operate.Beckett Mar. 89 The cards featured most of the better known players in baseball in 1988 and were sold in toy stores throughout the United States and Canada during 1989 Major League Baseball season. LJN and Topps planned to debut talking NFL and NBA cards (it stated in print advertising \\"Coming Soon - NFL Football and NBA Basketball Talking Cards), but those plans, along with follow-up MLB editions, were canceled as the card players often broke or played with poor audio quality.Beckett Nov. 89 Stores were flooded with returned boxes of Baseball Talk and by the fall of 1989 many of the cards and players could be found in discount bins at places like Toys R Us and Target. At one point, packs of cards that had been priced at $4 a piece were selling for as low as 50 cents by stores that were eager to move a failed product.  Cards  The SportsTalk player was sold with four cards (a checklist card that served as an introduction to the series, a Hank Aaron card, and the cards of 1988 stars Don Mattingly and Orel Hershiser). Additional cards were sold with four to a pack and were labeled in a manner that let the buyer know what cards were inside. Mel Allen narrated eight cards that featured highlights from historic games as well as 33 cards of former stars such as Babe Ruth and Duke Snider. Hall of Fame legends like Ted Williams, Sandy Koufax, Warren Spahn, Willie Mays, Joe DiMaggio and Bob Feller were omitted from the set as they did not agree to take part.Beckett Mar 89 Don Drysdale interviewed the players of the National League for their cards and Joe Torre did the same for the American League players.

He was a well-known Italian television personality. Biography He was born in Rome, but spent his youth in Pula, where his father, an Admiral of the Regia Marina, directed the local naval academy. During World War II he joined the Italian Social Republic, the fascist puppet state established in northern Italy after the Allied invasion of Italy. He was captured by American troops. In 1958 he met actress Sandra Mondaini, whom he would marry four years later, and with whom he frequently appeared in TV shows during his whole career. His first famous partner on the small screen was Ugo Tognazzi with whom, starting from 1954, he hosted the satyrical show Un due tre; the show was halted in 1959 after the duo performed an ironical sketch about the then-president of the Republic, Giovanni Gronchi. Vianello then moved full-time to cinema, appearing in a total of 79 films between 1947 and 1968. In the 1970s he returned to RAI (the Italian state broadcasting company, then the only one existing) with a series of Saturday shows which made him and Mondaini extremely popular as hosts and authors of sketches. During his TV career Vianello also hosted quiz shows, such as Zig Zag and Il gioco del 9 on Canale 5; he also hosted the 1998 edition of the Sanremo Music Festival and, from 1991 to 1999, Pressing, Mediaset's Sunday night sports talk show. His best-known and long-lasting TV programme, Casa Vianello, was a sit-com shot from 1988 to 2008 and broadcast by Mediaset channels Canale 5 and later moved to Rete 4, in which he and Mondaini played fictionalised versions of themselves.

Early life James Clyman was born on a farm that belonged to George Washington in Fauquier County, Virginia, in 1792. Clyman's family started to migrate from place to place when Clyman was 15, moving from Virginia to Pennsylvania, and then to Ohio. In 1811, his family decided to settle in Stark County, Ohio. In 1812, Clyman became a ranger to fight the Shawnee Indians in the War of 1812. After the war, he took up farming in Indiana, where he also traded with local Indians. In 1821, he became a surveyor working near the Little Vermilion River in Illinois. He was hired by a son of Alexander Hamilton, who was running government surveys, to make surveys along the Sangamon River. Mountain Man While collecting his pay in Saint Louis in 1823, he met William H. Ashley, and joined Ashley's 1823 expedition. James Clyman was with Ashley's men from 1823 to 1827. He fought in the Arikara War in 1823. As a member of Ashley's expedition, Clyman wrote one of the two accounts detailing Hugh Glass's mauling by grizzly bear.http://hughglass.org/jim-bridger/ Clyman also traveled with Jedediah Smith, whose scalp and ear he sewed back on following a savage grizzly bear mauling, and Thomas Fitzpatrick in the discovery of the South Pass.Bernard DeVoto, The Year of Decision: 1846. Boston: Little, Brown, 1943, p. 53 He also was a member of the party of four that paddled around the Great Salt Lake and put to rest the myth of the Buenaventura River. After his explorations, he bought a farm, near Danville, Vermilion County, Illinois and set up a store there. Then, the Blackhawk War broke out and Clyman joined the fight. He left the army in early 1834 and returned to Illinois. Less than a year later he returned to Wisconsin, where he arrived in January 1835.CAMP C.L., red., James Clyman, Frontiersman, 1792-1881: The Adventures of A Trapper and Covered-Wagon Emigrant As Told in His Own Reminiscences and Diaries, Portland, 1960, p. 46-49. He spent some time in Milwaukee County and made the decision to venture further north in the fall with his friend Ellisworth Burnett. They left on November 4, 1835 and on the second day out, they were attacked by two Native American men near present-day Theresa, Dodge County. Burnett was killed, while Clyman got wounded but managed to escape and hide in the woods. This story became well known in the region and when in the years afterwards immigrants started to settle Dodge County they named one of the towns \\"Clyman\\" to remember what once happened in the area. In later years, he traveled back West and crossed the Great Salt Lake Desert and the Sierra Nevada. On his way back, he encountered the Donner-Reed Party and accompanying parties and advised them to avoid the shortcut and remain on the regular route. They did not heed his warning and ended up resorting to cannibalism after becoming stranded and trapped by an early blizzard in the Sierra Nevada. In 1848, Clyman settled in the Napa Valley. He died there in 1881 and was buried in the Tulocay Cemetery in Napa, California. References Sources *DeVoto, Bernard The Year of Decision: 1846 Boston: Little, Brown, 1943. *Morgan, Dale L.

The first volume was released on November 18, 2003, with the next two volumes not released until 2005. At the 2005 AnimeNEXT convention, the ADV representative David L. Williams said the slow schedule was due to ADV Manga feeling the market was too saturated with new manga titles at the time and that they had rushed into the manga market. However, after the third volume was released that year, the series went on a two-year hiatus. The series was restarted in July 2007 with the publication of the fourth volume, and six volumes were released through April 2008.

W. Hornung, and features the gentleman thief A. J. Raffles, and his companion and biographer, Bunny Manders. The story was first published in Scribner's Magazine in February 1901. The story was also included as the second story in the collection The Black Mask, published by Grant Richards in London, and Charles Scribner's Sons in New York, both in 1901.Rowland, page 280. Plot While walking idly on the roof of their Earl's Court home at midnight with Bunny, Raffles announces they will visit the British Museum to investigate how they can steal its golden trinkets. Bunny is reluctant to steal trinkets, until Raffles tells him that there is a gold cup among the trinkets worth several thousand pounds, and then Bunny becomes even more excited than Raffles. The next morning, after a visit to Kew Gardens to maintain the appearance that Raffles is an invalid in need of fresh air, Raffles and Bunny visit the Room of Gold in the British Museum. Bunny is disappointed by the cup's thinness, while Raffles admires its beauty. While Raffles discusses stealing the gold cup, a constable overhears and approaches. After suavely assuaging the constable's fears, Raffles observes that the three of them are alone; the room's attendant who is supposed to be present is down the corridor with speaking to attendant. To Bunny's surprise, Raffles knocks out the constable with his fists, before the constable can blow his whistle. At Raffles's bidding, Bunny ensures that the two attendants did not hear. Bunny returns to see Raffles's pockets are empty, yet Raffles walks with Bunny slowly out of the museum. They take a roundabout way home using several cabs. At home, Bunny is infuriated that Raffles lied to him about only visiting the museum for the sake of investigating, but Raffles answers that there was no lie, and his intentions only changed because of the rare opportunity of the room's attendant being absent. Raffles has hidden the gold cup underneath his top hat. Raffles grows infatuated with the cup, and for some time he refuses to part with it. Eventually, however, Raffles sends Bunny to buy a large box of Huntley & Palmers biscuits, as part of a new scheme involving the cup. Raffles packs the gold cup into the box, then disguises himself to pass the porter on his way to dispose of the box. After returning, Raffles reveals to Bunny that he has been to the post office, and sent the cup to Queen Victoria as an anonymous present to mark her Diamond Jubilee. Adaptations Television The story was adapted for television as the Raffles episode \\"The Gold Cup\\", which first aired on 18 March 1977. Anthony Valentine portrayed A. J. Raffles and Christopher Strauli portrayed Bunny Manders. In the television adaptation, a subplot is inserted about a society of criminologists, taken from \\"The Criminologists' Club\\", another Raffles short story. Part of \\"A Jubilee Present\\" was adapted into the episode \\"The First Step\\". Radio BBC Radio adapted the story into the second half of the thirteenth episode of its Raffles radio drama, \\"No Sinecure\\", which first aired on 30 July 1992. The drama features Jeremy Clyde as Raffles and Michael Cochrane as Bunny. The plot faithfully follows that of the original story, with only minimal changes: * In the original story, Bunny is initially eager to steal the gold cup. In the episode, he is reluctant from the start. * In the episode, the visit to Kew Gardens is for fun only, rather than serving as a blind. * In the episode, Raffles and Bunny have to wait for Dr. Theobald to go on his honeymoon before visiting the British museum. In the original story, Dr. Theobald is already away. * In the original story, Raffles disguises himself to pass the porter on his way to send the gold cup. In the episode, Bunny distracts the porter.

He was posthumously inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame, Pioneers Category in 2008. Early life Donnelly was born in the docks of Dublin, Ireland in March 1788. He came from a family of seventeen children. Donnelly grew up in poverty; his father was a carpenter, but suffered from chest complaints and was frequently out of work. As soon as he was able, Donnelly also went to work as a carpenter. On the streets of Dublin, Donnelly had a reputation of being a hard man to provoke, but was known to be \\"handy with his fists\\", and he became the district's new fighting hero.Myler 1976, p. 26 There are a number of anecdotes about Donnelly's life in this period, including his rescue of a young woman being attacked by two sailors at the dockside, leading to his arm being badly mangled. He was taken to the premises of the prominent surgeon Dr. Abraham Colles who saved Donnelly's arm from amputation, describing him as a \\"pocket Hercules\\".Myler 1976, p. 27‚Äì28 Another tale concerns Donnelly's insistence of carrying the body of an old lady who had died of a highly contagious fever to a local graveyard, where he buried the body himself in a grave that had been \\"reserved for a person of distinction\\". Early boxing career Donnelly was nearly six feet (1.83 m) tall and weighed almost 14 stone (196 lbs, 89 kg). He was described as \\"a courageous man\\". As news of his fighting exploits with Dublin's feuding gangs spread swiftly.Myler 1976, p. 29 He gained a reputation for keeping local criminals in check. One boxer, recognized as champion of the city, became jealous of Donnelly's reputation and took to following him around the local taverns demanding a fight. Eventually, Donnelly relented and the fight was staged on the banks of the Grand Canal. The event aroused a great deal of interest in Dublin, and a good crowd turned up. Right up to the time they took sparring positions, Donnelly tried to talk his rival out of fighting, but his pleas fell on deaf ears. As the fight dragged on, Donnelly gradually overcame his rival, and in a furious attack in the 16th round, beat him to the ground. Donnelly was declared the new champion of the city.Myler 1976, p. 30 \\"Sporting\\" Captain William Kelly, the man credited with \\"discovering\\" Donnelly.Around this time, an Irish aristocrat was sitting in an English tavern. Captain William Kelly listened as a pair of English prize-fighters mocked Ireland's reputation as a nation of courageous men. Kelly considered this an affront to his native land and resolved to find a fighting Irishman to take up the challenge.Myler 1976, p. 31 His search eventually took him to Dublin and to Dan Donnelly. King of the Curragh When prize fights were first introduced, it was the Fancy who tended to the boxers. The Fancy were aristocrats who followed the sport in the 18th and 19th centuries. They organized the training, the matches, and the finance. Donnelly's first big fight under the patronage of Captain Kelly, was staged at the Curragh in County Kildare on 14 September 1814.Egan 1824, p. 389 The spot was known at the time as Belcher's Hollow, a natural amphitheatre that was regularly used for big prize fights. Donnelly's opponent was a prominent English fighter, Tom Hall, who was touring Ireland, giving sparring exhibitions and boxing instruction. By one o'clock when the bout was due to start, an estimated 20,000 people packed onto the sides of the hollow, at the base of which a 22-foot (6.71 m) square had been roped off. Jack Broughton's Rules, drawn up in 1743, lasted 110 years until replaced by the London Prize Ring Rules. Boxing at that time was very different from the boxing of today. There were few rules. There was no boxing organization to oversee the sport or lay down regulations or procedures. There was no formal end to the fights: they would go on until one fighter was unable to continue or would give up. A now obsolete practice was that of the seconds. The seconds would wait in the ring during the fight, and assist the boxer between rounds. There were no restrictions regarding fight tactics. For example, a fighter could hit his opponent's head off a corner post, or wrestle his opponent to the ground, or pull his hair, or wrap his arm around his neck in a choking motion and then hit him in the face with the other hand. The fights were very severe and often brutal, and they would continue until the end. A round could last as long as six or seven minutes, or a little as 30 seconds. The round would end when one person was on the ground. He would then have 30 seconds to get up and continue the fight. For a few rounds, Hall was showing his skill was paramount. He scored first blood, which was an important occasion in bare-fist boxing; there were bets made on who would draw first blood. But as the rounds went on, Donnelly's strength began to tell. Hall would slip down onto his knee, without being in any danger. This was a tactic, because once he went down the round was over, he got a 30-second rest, and came back refreshed. He was doing this just a bit too often for Donnelly's liking, and at one stage, Donnelly was just about to lash out when he was down, and his second shouted out an admonishment that Dan would lose the fight if he did so. Eventually he did lose his temper, and as Hall slipped down yet again, Donnelly lashed out and hit him on the ear; the blood flowed. That was the end of the round. Hall refused to continue, saying he had been fouled, that Donnelly should be disqualified. Donnelly fans voiced that no, Dan had definitely won, Hall didn't want to fight on, Donnelly was the champion. The fight ended in some controversy, but to the Irish, he was the conquering hero.Miles 1906, p. 139 Belcher's Hollow was rechristened Donnelly's Hollow and Dan Donnelly was now acclaimed as Ireland's Champion. For a short while, at least, the country celebrated its new hero. The Irish saw sporting heroes like Dan Donnelly as the symbolic winner of the bigger fight. While Ireland was left without its own government, England was becoming increasingly more powerful. Whenever Dan's right hand bloodied an English nose, it was hailed as a strike, however small, against the oppressors. Cooper's challenge It was the summer of 1815, and while Ireland was at its weakest, England had never seemed stronger. Wellington had beaten Napoleon at Waterloo and Britannia certainly ruled the waves. In the minds of the populace, Dan Donnelly epitomized the national struggle in an Ireland governed by mad old George III, championing their seemingly hopeless cause against the intransigent representatives of the Crown. In Irish folk tradition, the hero took center stage. That goes back to the storytelling tradition which still exists today. The hero is revered; he's someone who is willing to stand up and fight for himself and his people. Dan was synonymous with Ireland as he was a patriot. He lived and fought in the period after the 1798 Rebellion and the Act of Union, and during the Catholic Emancipation movement. Spirits and morale were good in Ireland at that time. As a patriotic man himself, the timing couldn't be better for Donnelly. The political climate between Ireland and Britain is better and more peaceful today than it has been in a very long time, but if a rugby or soccer game is held between the two countries, there is a certain amount of tension or jingoism. Dan Donnelly and his boxing matches embodied this mentality in the early 19th century. It's symbolic of how the Irish and the English fought their political battles on the football pitch and in the boxing ring. Donnelly was a national hero, but he was also broke.Myler 1976, p. 48 He drank away the purse from beating Tom Hall, but the chance of another big payday eventually presented itself. He was approached by George Cooper and Tom Molyneux, two leading prize-fighters who were touring Ireland on an exhibition tour to teach the art of boxing.Myler 1976, p. 49 George Cooper, a first-rate ringman, and the opponent in Donnelly's most celebrated victory.These two came to Dublin, heard of Donnelly, and invited him to meet them in a local pub. They prevailed upon him to fight Molyneux originally, and he said no. He had no desire to fight a conquered man, because Molyneux had just been beaten by the other man of the company, George Cooper. Molyneux was hurt by this curt refusal, but he was calmed down by his companion. Arrangements were made for the fight with Cooper. The bout was set for 13 November 1815. Once again, it was to be staged at Donnelly's Hollow on the Curragh in County Kildare. News of Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo was resounding around Europe. George Cooper was a hotter favorite than the Iron Duke had been in his bout with the Little Corporal. Cooper was a bargeman with a fearful reputation. He was of gypsy bloodMyler 1976, p. 50 and he was 10/1 on to batter Dan Donnelly. From early morning, crews began to converge on Donnelly's Hollow. They came from far and wide, using every horse-drawn contraption they could find, or on horseback. If they couldn't do so, they gladly walked the distance. There were 20,000 people packed in there on that day. Excitement was intense.Myler 1976, p. 52 Bets were made back then as is still customary to this day. Bets were made on the results of the fight, on who'd draw the first blood, or on who would score the first knockdown. There were rules, but they were designed to accommodate gambling, the public, and those who organized the fight. The boxers themselves were of no consequence. It was a fight that went one way then the other for a round. Again, Donnelly's strength would always tell in a bare-knuckle fight to the finish.Myler 1976, p. 55 In one round, Cooper used the cross-buttock tactic with Donnelly and severely winded him.Miles 1906, p. 140 The cross- buttock was more a wrestling maneuver than a boxing one, but it was legitimate under the rules of the time. A competitor gets, more or less, in front of his opponent, and throws his adversary over his hip, causing him to land with great force on the ground. If one popular story is to be believed, Donnelly, who was being badly beaten in the fifth round, was saved by the magical properties of a lump of sugar cane slipped to him by Captain Kelly's sister. She had been pleading with Dan to win, telling him she had bet her entire estate on the outcome. When Donnelly failed to respond, she slipped him a piece of the sugar cane, while urging him, \\"Now my charmer, give him a warmer!\\" The Irish champion was rejuvenated and the course of the fight changed. In the seventh round, he sent Cooper flat on his back on the turf and jumped on top of him, winding Cooper so badly he could hardly rise. He did rise for the next round, but in the eleventh, Donnelly finished him off with a tremendous right hand that smashed Cooper's jaw. The sound of the cheering was likened to the sound of artillery going off.Egan 1824, p. 391 The cheers could be heard in villages for miles around. Donnelly was the conquering hero. As Donnelly proudly strode up the hill towards his carriage, fanatical followers dug out imprints left by his feet. Leading from the monument which commemorates the scene of his greatest victory, \\"The Steps to Strength and Fame\\" are still to be seen in Donnelly's Hollow. Donnelly politely declined all invitations to celebrate his triumph in the taverns of County Kildare. He had promised his friends and family he would return to Dublin immediately after the fight. Newspapers in the 18th century had many references to boxing. However, this was bare-knuckle fighting, fighting that was severe and sometimes brutal. That type of boxing was at its most popular during Dan's time. Boxing champions in those days became well-renowned. He was aware that political conflict was very much to the fore then. He accepted that he was representing the Irish people in this area in which he was active. He was a patriot, who, if needed, would stand up for his beliefs. Monument at Donnelly's Hollow on the Curragh in County Kildare\\" Footsteps at Donnelly's Hollow on the Curragh in County Kildare\\" Later life Donnelly became a publican, hoping his notoriety would entice extra customers eager to hear stirring tales of his prize-ring. He had a reputation for being a gambler, a womanizer and a drunkard. Donnelly was the proprietor of a succession of four Dublin pubs, all of them unprofitable. Fallon's Capstan Bar is the only one still in existence. In his third and final fight on 21 July 1819, he defeated Tom Oliver in 34 rounds on English turf, at Crawley Down in Sussex. A full fight report was filed by the foremost prizefighting chronicler of the period, Pierce Egan. Egan irately described the reception accorded to Donnelly during a benefit night (6 April 1819) as 'rather foul': 'It was very unlike the usual generosity of John Bull towards a stranger ‚Äì It was not national ‚Äì but savoured something like prejudice' (Boxiana, vol. III).David Snowdon, Writing the Prizefight: Pierce Egan's Boxiana World (Bern, 2013) This animosity was borne predominantly from concern over the Irishman's fighting prowess, and Egan underscored the combination of resentment and overwhelming interest when reporting Donnelly's fight with Oliver: 'The English amateurs viewed him as a powerful opponent [and...] jealous for the reputation of the \\"Prize Ring\\", clenched their fists in opposition, whenever his growing fame was chaunted' (Boxiana, vol. III)David Snowdon, Writing the Prizefight: Pierce Egan's Boxiana World Hibernia lamenting the Death of Donnelly, her favourite champion. He died at Donnelly's Public House, the last tavern he owned, on 18 February 1820 at the age of 31. An oval wall plaque commemorates the site of his death. A squat, weather-beaten, gray obelisk surrounded by a short iron fence marks the exact site of the Cooper bout. The inscription on the monument: DAN DONNELLY BEAT COOPER ON THIS SPOT 13 December 1815. The date inscribed was inaccurate, as the bout actually took place one month earlier, on 13 November 1815, as reported in the Freeman's Journal the following day. Donnelly's arm Dan was laid to rest, albeit briefly, at Bully's Acre, one of the city's oldest cemeteries. After just a few nights, grave robbers put Donnelly's body in a sack and delivered him to an eminent surgeon who paid good money for cadavers for study. They may even have been working to order. Donnelly's admirers tracked the body to the home of a surgeon by the name of Hall and threatened him with death.Myler 1976, p. 16 There was a quick negotiation and he agreed to give the body back as long as he could keep the right arm, the one that slew the English champions, for medical observation. The arm was preserved in red lead paint, and traveled to a medical college in Scotland where it was used by medical students for a number of years to study how all the bones worked together. From an Edinburgh classroom, the arm became an exhibit in a Victorian travelling circus, and it journeyed around Britain many times. In the early 20th century, it finally came back to Ireland. In 1904, a Belfast bookmaker, Hugh \\"Texas\\" McAlevey, acquired the arm and displayed it in his pub. The publican got tired of it and thought the grisly- looking sight might be frightening off customers, so he stuck it up in an attic. A betting parlor employee remembers as a teenager being told not to go up in the attic‚Äîthat Donnelly's ghost was up there.Myler 1976, p. 17 Donnelly's arm made it back to Kilcullen in the 1950s. Publican Jim Byrne came up with the idea of recreating Donnelly's fight with George Cooper in the Curragh. The fight was promoted by bringing Donnelly's arm back to where it defeated the English opponent. The pageant brought the historic contest alive again, rekindling the Dan Donnelly fire. It was An T√≥stal, an Irish festival started at that time nationwide in an effort to promote tourism. Each region was encouraged to have some sort of festival to attract visitors. This was the genesis of the Dan Donnelly pageant. Kevin McCourt, an army officer, was picked to play George Cooper, the English champion; Jim Berney was chosen to portray Dan Donnelly, the Irish champion. George Cooper and Dan Donnelly, as played by McCourt and Berney, had a group of supporters as well, dressed up and cheering, carrying them down into the arena. Two \\"supporters\\" performed getting involved in a ruckus. Local sporting clubs and townspeople comprised the spectators. \\"The longest arms in the history of pugilism.\\"Donnelly's arm found a new home in Jim Byrne's pub, \\"The Hideout.\\" It became a popular attraction in Kilcullen. It was on display there for 43 years until Jim Byrne died and the pub passed to his son, Desmond, who was unaware of the arms value, and in 1997 he eventually sold the pub. The arm sat in his and Josephine's basement piled under junk for almost a decade until an Americanhttps://www.independent.ie/irish-news/grisly-tale-of-the-boxers-arm- that-left-local-pub-and-went-walkabout-26412437.html relative, Thomas Donnelly, began a national search for the arm. After several radio interviews and articles, the nations intrigue began to grow again on the whereabouts of the arm. Des died in 2005. After the media search gained traction, Josephine revealed that they kept the arm during the sale and it was disrespectfully laying in their basement. Josephine wouldn't let the human limb that was almost 200 years old go into a cargo hold for transportation to America. One of Des's bandmates had been Henry Donohoe, then the chief pilot for Aer Lingus. She called him and asked how to get the arm to the States. He told her that he would take it in the cockpit with himself. Josephine sat in first class. A special box was made for the arm, crating around it to prevent it from getting banged around. It fit into the cockpit with two inches to spare. As the centerpiece of the Fighting Irishmen Exhibit, Donnelly's arm went on display at the Irish Arts Center in New York City, in the autumn of 2006. The show traveled across the city to the South Street Seaport Museum in 2007. Its next appearance was at Boston College's John J. Burns Library in 2008. The arm returned to Ireland in 2009 when the show arrived at the Ulster American Folk Park in Omagh. 2010 was a homecoming when the exhibition appeared at the Gaelic Athletic Association museum at Croke Park in Dublin. Legends Almost two centuries after his death. Donnelly remains the subject of urban legend. One contends that he had the longest arms in boxing history, with the ability to touch his knees without bending down. Another claims that he was knighted by the Prince Regent. His arms were actually of normal length for a man of his size. No known documentation exists to support the latter.

Niger was part of Thomas Becket's entourage during the latter's exile in France in the early 1160s and played an important role in connecting the exiled archbishop with Pope Alexander III's German ally Conrad of Mainz. After the reconciliation between Henry II and Becket, he was employed by the king, but he left England for France after Becket's murder in 1170. After Henry's death in 1189, he returned to England, where he became a canon in Lincoln. Works Apart from several theological works, Niger wrote two chronicles in Latin, one on the German emperors and the kings of France and England, which runs up to 1206, and the other one treating history from the world's origin up to the year 1199. In his chronicle, he remained a ‚Äúviolent partisan‚Äù of Becket and a critic of Henry, declaring that ‚Äúthe king let no year pass without molesting the country with new laws.‚Äù His English chronicle was continued by Ralph of Coggeshall. Niger also wrote a treatise De re militari in which he was critical towards the Third Crusade. Niger is an important source for late medieval music in Britain. A collection of four offices ‚Äì Nativity, Annunciation, Assumption, and Purification ‚Äî composed by him, both notation and text, is preserved in the library of Lincoln Cathedral (15, fols. 33‚Äì43, excepting 42). He introduces the offices with a short Latin treatise on the feasts. Most of his works are secular.

MFT software is marketed to corporate enterprises as an alternative to using ad-hoc file transfer solutions, such as FTP (file transfer protocol), HTTP and others.  Background  From its inception, FTP has made moving large volumes of bulk data between any two entities ‚Äî including file servers, applications, and trading partners ‚Äî possible. However, FTP (and other communication protocols such as HTTP and SMTP) do not, on their own, provide a way to secure or manage the payload or the transmission. Yet, regardless of the lack of security and management capabilities, many companies have continued to transport large batches of structured and unstructured data using these protocols. This practice is changing, however. According to Gartner Research, \\"Organizations often use MFT solutions to replace FTP. This is due to increased focus on compliance, privacy regulations and corporate transparency ‚Äî which demand increased auditing, management, security and process.\\"  MFT Features  While Managed File Transfer always recovers the same features‚Äîreporting (e.g., notification of successful file transfers), non-repudiation, audit trails, global visibility, automation of file transfer-related activities and processes, end- to-end security, and performance metrics/monitoring‚Äîthe way it is used has a major impact on the nature of the appropriate solution. Gartner analysts agree on 6 different usage patterns for MFT, all of which are defined by their own markers and require different methods: # Ad Hoc # Accelerated Transfer or \\"Extreme\\" Transfer # A2A (Administrative-2-Administration) # B2B # Cloud # SOA Typical MFT functionality MFT centers around the secure and efficient transfer of data, but most MFT software solutions offer additional features. Typically, MFT software offers reporting (e.g., notification of successful file transfers), non-repudiation, audit trails, global visibility, the ability to automate file transfer-related activities and processes, end-to-end security, and performance metrics. MFT applications are available as both on- premises licensed software packages and software-as-a-service (\\"SaaS\\") solutions. MFT solutions are largely designed for enterprise implementations. MFT applications are characterized by having all or most of the following features: * Support multiple file transfer protocols including PeSIT, FTP/S, OFTP, SFTP, SCP, AS2, and HTTP/S. * Securely transfer files over public and private networks using encrypted file transfer protocols. * Securely store files using multiple data encryption methods * Automate file transfer processes between trading partners and exchanges including detection and handling of failed file transfers. * Authenticate users against existing user repositories such as LDAP and Active Directory * Integrate to existing applications using documented APIs (application programming interfaces) * Generate detailed reports on user and file transfer activity. Alternative definition of characteristics One vendor in the description of their product identifies six issues with commercial use of FTP of even SFTP that Managed File Transfer seeks to address. The issues revolve around security weaknesses of traditional FTP in an increasing cyber threat environment and meeting increasing stringent regulatory compliance for data. While bespoke solutions may resolve some of these issues, MFT can address them with a standardized approach, along with the ability to be customized.

It connects the Engadin valley with Lago di Livigno, through Munt la Schera. Completed in 1965, the tunnel is in length. The tunnel was built to transport building materials for the construction of the Punt dal Gall dam. It was opened for public use in 1968, but is still owned and operated by the hydroelectric power company Engadiner Kraftwerke AG. The tunnel is only wide enough for a single vehicle so traffic moves in alternate directions, controlled by traffic lights which change every 15 minutes. (A different pattern of alternating traffic applies on Saturdays in winter.) The tunnel is open 24 hours a day to motor vehicles no more than in height and in width but since 2008 it is closed to cyclists. From June to September, cyclists may take their cycles on a half-hourly shuttle bus, and at other times they may use a limited number of places on the public bus service. As of May 2015, the standard daytime toll for a single car journey through the tunnel is CHF16/EUR15. Slightly higher tolls are charged at night.

It is an entity within the education department at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, which is a world-renowned botanical garden located in Brooklyn, New York. PGR is estimated to reach 2,500 students annually in Brooklyn's most under-served neighborhoods. Funding for PGR comes mostly from private grants. This allows the programs that operate under the auspices of PGR to be very inexpensive and accessible. School year programming During the school year, Project Green Reach instructors partner with classroom teachers in Brooklyn's Title I schools. During the course of the school year, PGR works with 80 classes of students, grades kindergarten through eighth grade. Each class of PGR participants has three sessions with PGR: one school visit in which the students participate in a botanically oriented workshop during which each student gets their own plant to keep for ongoing study, one visit to the garden in which the students explore the plants that are on display and participate in some hands-on activities in the greenhouses, and a final, culminating, school visit in which the students perform a horticulture- based community service project. In addition, PGR runs two more professional development workshops for the participating teachers. Currently, PGR offers four curricula for their classroom visit workshops: life cycle of a bulb, kitchen botany, desert environments, and the tropical rainforest. Summer program Project Green Reach plots in the Children's Garden At the end of the school year, participating teachers of grades 4, 5 and 6 are asked to nominate one or two students who reacted positively to the classroom visit, the tour of the Garden, and/or the ongoing investigation with plants in their classroom to apply for PGR's summer program. One other important qualification for admission to the program is that the student should have little or no other summer programming options. Candidates for the summer program are nominated by their teachers, and go through an application and interview process before being accepted into the program. The accepted applicants then participate in Project Green Reach's six-week summer program, which is divided into two smaller subsections: the Junior Botanist program, and the Plant Investigator program. First-time students are automatically placed into the Junior Botanist program, which is specifically designed for children who have little or no horticultural or botanical experience. Junior Botanists are then given the opportunity to reapply and become Plant Investigators for a second summer. Since Plant Investigators have some prior experience, their curriculum is usually more focused on life sciences. Junior Botanists and Plant investigators spend the morning together, typically working on their plots in the Children's Garden, and have separate lessons after lunch.

Origins The first Oojah comic strip was issued on 18 February 1919. By the early 1920s the newspaper was issuing a 4-page 'The Oojah Paper' supplement starting Saturday, 8 October 1921. It later became 'The Oojah Sketch' that ran until 23 November 1929, the 4-page section reduced to 3 pages from 29 April 1922 and 2 pages from 22 July 1922. Other characters were Snooker, a small black cat who always wears bedsocks and lives with the Great Oojah and Don, a little boy who is the Little Oojah and the Jum-Jarum. Later, additional characters included Jerrywangle (aka Jerry), the Oojah's elephant nephew who was always up to mischief with his tricks, as well as Lord Lion and his family. The character name for the large elephant that came to be known simply as 'Oojah' is quoted as initially being 'Flip-Flap the Great Oojah'. The 'Oojah House' book gives this description: 'FLIP-FLAP is a magic elephant who lives in a strange animal-country called Oojahland. He is the Great Oojah.' Later annuals and comic strips name him 'Uncle Oojah'. There are some phrases that are mentioned frequently in the stories, such as exclamations by Snooker the cat with \\"My Bedsocks!\\", \\"My Whiskers!\\" and The Oojah himself with \\"Lovey-lovekins!\\" and \\"Jimmy-ninnikins!\\" Revival Years The series was revived as the comic strip 'The Wonderful Adventures of Jerry, Don and Snooker' running for 203 episodes from 27 February 1954 to 11 January 1958. 'Jerry's Jolly Jingles' featuring Jerry, Oojah's cousin, ran for another seven months. This was the last issued of the Oojah series. The Artists Thomas Maybank (full name Hector Thomas Maybank Webb) born in Beckenham, Kent on 29 February 1869, was the original artist for the series. Maybank died on 27 March 1929. The 1929 Annual featured Maybank's artwork, the 1934 annual featured artwork by the anonymous 'JHL'. Later, H. M. Talintyre (full name Henry Matthew Talintyre) continued the series in the same style until the early 1950s. Oojah Annuals and Books The Oojah series' first appearances were in the children's annual 'Once Upon a Time - Hulton's Children's Annual 1920' firstly with a story entitled 'Flip- Flap The Great Oojah' and also one called 'The Pigmy Pirates'. In the 'Once Upon a Time - Hulton's Children's Annual 1921' a 27-page story appeared entitled \\"Flip-Flap in Wangletown\\" which included a colour plate entitled \\"The Band will now Sing a Dance\\", and secondly with a 23-page story \\"The Wonder- man\\" including a further colour plate \\"The Rabbits were playing 'Oranges and Lemons'\\". Oojah's third annual appearance was the 1921 issued 'The Joy Book Children's Annual 1922' with a full story entitled 'Flip Flap In London Town'. The stories in all three annuals were told by Flo Lancaster and pictured by Thomas Maybank. A slim 36-page book of annual size entitled 'Oojah House - The Story of Flip-Flap's Little Mansion' was issued by E. Hulton in 1921-22 featuring just a long Oojah story. The cover states it was part of the 'Oojah Books' series which included a tracing book 'Baby Binky's Birthday' which did not feature Oojah. The first proper annual was 'The Oojah Annual', issued in 1922 as the undated 1923 annual. This features an advert for the 1923 Joy Book on the back so it could be dated correctly. The undated 1924 Annual features a Portcullis with the cat Snooker with a coffee pot on his head. The undated 1925 Annual features a baby bear being spoonfed. The undated 1926 Annual features Oojah sitting on a stile wearing a hat. Further annuals and books were issued featuring Thomas Maybank's artwork including the 1927 'The Oojah's Treasure Trunk' (dated from the late 1926 competition ending date inside) and the 1928 issued 'Uncle Oojah's Big Annual' (dated from having a 1929 calendar throughout the book). Later Oojah Annuals featuring mostly the H. M. Talintyre artwork continued intermittently from the 1930s to the early 1950s. References * Once Upon a Time - Hulton's Children's Annual 1920. E.

In a slightly modified form, it is equivalent to the well-known abc conjecture. It is named for Lucien Szpiro who formulated it in the 1980s.

The broadcast covered technical advances in the industry such as the launch of satellite television and NICAM stereo, along with details of new transmitters and the scheduling of transmitter downtime. Engineering Announcements, and the BBC's similar Service Information, are examples of regularly scheduled \\"ghost programmes,\\" so called because they were never advertised in on-air schedules, in newspaper TV listings, the TV Times or on teletext. Scheduling Engineering Announcements was originally scheduled directly after Monday's Newcomers, another example of a ghost programme which offered the advertising trade the opportunity to watch first runs of new adverts before they aired in prime time on ITV. It was shown at 9:45am. In September 1972, Engineering Announcements moved to 9:10am on Tuesdays, where it remained until May 1983 as the launch of TV-am meant that the ITV network would no longer be available to show the programme although it was still shown on ITV for the two months following the launch of TV-am, in the 10-minute gap between the end of TV-am and the start of ITV - the gap was needed to allow for switching ITV from national transmission to the local ITV contractor. When this process became automated, the gap was no longer required. TV-am's hours were extended until 9:25am and consequently the slot used to transmit Engineering Announcements disappeared. At this point, the programme was switched to Channel 4 and S4C, with the first edition on the new channel being broadcast on 24 May 1983.IBA Engineering Announcements - 24 May 1983 'First show on C4 & S4C' It continued to be shown at the same time (Tuesdays at 9:15am) with a repeat at 12:15 pm the same day. However, as broadcasting hours increased, Engineering Announcements was forced into increasingly earlier time slots. The 12:15pm repeat was lost in September 1987 when ITV Schools was transferred to Channel 4/S4C. It moved to 8:10am at the start of 1989 and when Channel 4 launched its breakfast television service in April 1989, Engineering Announcements was moved to 5:45am, where it could be recorded by engineers for later viewing. It remained in that early morning slot until the programme's final edition on 31 July 1990.IBA Engineering Announcements final edition During the ITV strike from August to October 1979, Engineering Announcements was the only programme broadcast on most of the network.
