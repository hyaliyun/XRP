Early life She was born on March 26, 1824, in Bains-les- Bains in the Vosges. Her father died when she was less than two years old, and she and her seven siblings moved with their mother to Fontenoy, staying with the family of their father. She studied Latin, Greek, German, history, and geography with help from her brother. In 1844, she received a teacher's certificate of ability, and had also studied zoology at the Museum of Natural History in Paris. At the museum, she was taught by renowned specialist Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. Despite her education and lack of laws explicitly barring women from entering academia, she was rejected from numerous French universities.

Childhood  Born Madeleine Alexandrine Gebelin, she told in the Medical Chronicle on 1 April 1895 that her interest in medicine started in her early childhood: - \\"I was barely eight years old when my father, who was a wheelwright by trade - it is not a silly job - drove me to the sisters' home where he carried out his work...\\" In the hospital of N√Æmes, one nun took an affection to her and taught her some small procedures, such as the preparation of herbal teas and poultices. She was twelve when the Gebelin family left for Paris, and just over fifteen when she married Adrien-St√©phane Br√®s, a tram conductor. Br√®s was able to pursue higher education thanks to the efforts of Julie-Victoire Daubi√©, who, in 1861, became the first female baccalaureate in France. However Br√®s had to first obtain the consent of her husband, as at the time French law judged married women to be the legal responsibility of their husbands.  Education  In 1866, she presented herself to the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Paris, Charles Adolphe Wurtz, and asked him for permission to enroll to study medicine. The dean agreed, but on the condition that she first obtain a degree in Arts and Sciences‚Äîa task which she accomplished in three years. By then, she was 26 years old and a mother of three. Br√®s presented herself to the Dean once again and told him there was now no obstacle to her enrollment in the medical course. She also pointed out that three female foreigners‚Äîthe American Mary Putnam, the Russian Catherine Gontcharoff and the English Elizabeth Garrett Anderson‚Äîwere holders of nationally known equivalent degrees. At the time, prejudice against women doctors was still strong in the academic and medical community. In a widely discussed 1868 article in the Hospitals Gazette, Dr. Henri Montanier wrote, \\"To make a woman a doctor, it is necessary to make her lose her sensitivity, her timidity, her modesty, harden her to the sight of the most horrible and frightening things. When the woman arrives at that, I ask myself, what remains of the woman? A being who is no longer either a young girl nor a woman; neither a wife, nor a mother.\\" Dean W√ºrtz took Br√®s's application to the Minister of Education, Victor Duruy, who approved her admission but preemptively brought the matter to the Council of Ministers. The Empress Eug√©nie also interceded on her behalf. Br√®s's husband formally gave his consent to his wife's enrollment to the mayor of the 5th municipal district of Paris, and she became a medical student in 1869 in the service of Professor Broca at Mercy Hospital. Her admission was facilitated by the proclamation of the law which allowed women to work (a.k.a. loi de 19 vent√¥se) during the XI year of the Empire on the sixth month of the Republican calendar. She was admitted alongside the American Mary Puttnam, the Russian Catherine Gontcharoff and the English Elizabeth Garrett - all holders of equivalent national diplomas and bachelors in Arts and Sciences. With the onset of the Franco-Prussian War and the departure of a number of hospital physicians for the front, she was made a temporary intern until July 1871, at Professor Broca's suggestion. Strengthened by this experience, Br√®s decided to pursue a hospital career and sat the external exams, then the internal. Despite the support of Professor Broca, the director of the hospital's Public Assistance refused her authorization to work at the hospital on 21 December 1871. Eventually, Br√®s decided against further pursuit of a hospital job. A widow with three children to support, she decided to become a pediatrician. She prepared her thesis, Of Breasts and Breastfeeding‚Äîwhich covered a wide range of material on the mother/child relationship and infant hygiene‚Äîin the laboratory of Professor W√ºrtz and defended it, on 3 June 1875. She received honors on her thesis and became the first French woman to become a Doctor of medicine (though not the first woman to obtain such a doctorate in France, since Anderson had been ahead of her by five years).  Study abroad in Paris  Her studies are meritory, during her second year in Medical School, in 1869, she is featured amongst those under professor Broca at the Piti√© Hospital. During her third year, from September 1870 to July 1871 she worked as an intern (this role performed without the title of \\"interim intern\\") in the same service in response to the Franco-Prussian War and the departure of many male doctors from the hospital to the front line. Then during the siege of Paris under the \\"Commune\\" she remained faithful and committed to her post showing her sense of devotion and responsibility. To this regard, the certificates from other physicians and the hospital administration praise to her performance. Professor Broca wrote: \\"Madame Br√®s in my opinion, was given the interim intern post. In that quality, during two sieges of Paris and through the month of July 1871, she has done her service with such details that no bombardment to our hospital has been able to interrupt. Her service has always been perfect and her tenure irreprochable.\\" As she was finishing her fourth year, she inquired to participate in the process to apply for an externship for October 1871. Despite the support of professor Broca, the director of hospitals and of public assistance refused her application for this process on 2 December 1871 under the following circumstance: \\"This is not in reference of you personally, I believe I could tell you that your permission for this could be agreed upon. However, the Council has understood that it could not henceforth restrict the questioning and the examinee on a general thesis within its applications and its consequences in future times, the Council has been unable to authorize this innovation that our Administration has decided to support\\". Madeleine Br√®s did not insist further. The access of medical students to the process of application for externship would not become effective until 1882; at that time, Blanche Edwards-Piller (1848-1941) became the first French externship participant away from the hospital. The process of application for internships would not be open to women applicants until 1886, and the first French intern to earn the official title was Marthe Francillon-Lobre(1873-1956) who completed this process in 1900.  Career in medicine  At the same time she was studying medicine, she spent four years at the Museum of Natural History under Edmond Fr√©my and three years in the laboratory of Charles Adolphe Wurtz where she prepared a research thesis, which she defended on 3 June 1875. The topic was \\"From the Bottle and breastfeeding\\" (fr. De la mamelle et de l'allaitement ) where she showed that the chemical composition of breast milk is modified during the course of breast-feeding to better aid the growth and development of the infant. She obtained a \\"well-done\\" mention and her thesis became known in France and abroad. She then became the first French Female Medical Doctor, however not the first woman to achieve this in France as the British Elizabeth Garrett Anderson achieved this goal five years before. As a widow she was responsible for three children. She decides to move within the city of Paris at the Rue Boissy-d'Anglas and to specialize in the relation between mother and child as well as the hygiene of young infants. She was surrounded by a clientele of a rich middle class. She was made responsible by the Prefect of Paris' Seine sector to teach (through conferences and informal talks) about guidelines to various personnel in maternal schools, cr√®ches and kindergartens through the twenty different administrative sectors of Paris. In 1885, she started her own nursery at 83 rue Nollet within the Batignolles sector, where she cared for and hosted infants and small children for free through the age of 3. This institution that she financed herself would be visited by Th√©ophile Roussel, and later by Marie-Louise Loubet. Later in 1891, as part of a mission of the Ministry of Interior, she went to Switzerland to study the organization and functional structure of nurseries and asylums. She would also lead the journal \\"Women's and Children's Hygiene\\" and authored of multiple books in child care and pediatric nursing.  Death  She died in poverty at the age of 79, in Montrouge.

It emerges from the northeastern end of Loch Garry just to the southeast of the Pass of Drumochter, and flows southeastwards and eastwards down Glen Garry to the narrow Pass of Killiecrankie beyond which it joins the Tummel Loch Garry itself is fed by the Allt Shallainn, Allt na Duinish and Allt na Cosaig which enter its southern end. The loch occupies a deep northeast-southwest aligned trench cut by glacial action. Glen Garry provides the main route northwards for both the A9 road and the railway from Perth to Inverness.  Tributaries  The principal tributaries of the Garry are the Allt Dubhaig, Edendon Water, Errochty Water, Bruar Water and the River Tilt. Arising in the Dalnaspidal Forest, the Allt Dubhaig joins the Garry near Dalnaspidal Lodge at the southern end of the Pass of Drumochter. The Edendon Water, known above Sronphadruig Lodge as the Allt a' Chama Choire, is a left-bank tributary of the Garry, joining it from the Dalnacardoch Forest at Edendon Bridge beside Dalnacardoch Lodge. The Errochty Water flows through Glen Errochty to enter the right bank of the Garry. Above the hamlet of Trinafour the river is impounded behind Errochty Dam as Loch Errochty. The Bruar Water arises from the confluence of several headwater streams at OS grid ref NN 819804 and flows southwards through Glen Bruar for several miles. to the northeast of the village of Calvine it drops over the Falls of Bruar and shortly afterwards enters the Garry on its left bank. The River Tilt arises from the confluence of the Tarf Water with the Allt Garbh Buidhe at OS grid ref NN 983797 from which point it flows in a southwesterly direction down the fault-aligned Glen Tilt. In the vicinity of Marble Lodge it turns gradually to a more southerly course and flowing under the Bridge of Tilt at Blair Atholl enters the left bank of the Garry. The Tarf Water follows a course from the west to plunge over the Falls of Tarf before joining the Tilt. Other tributaries of the Tilt include the burn known as An Lochain which drains the curiously named Loch Loch, and the Allt Mhairc which originates at the diminutive Loch Mhairc. The Allt Ghirnaig is a lesser tributary of the Garry whose headwaters arise on the southern slopes of Beinn a' Ghlo. It is the last to join via its left bank before the Garry enters the Tummel.

Of obscure origins, he attached himself to various influential politicians and favourites and rose to prominence with the support of William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke and Sir John Eliot. With Eliot he opposed the religious and fiscal innovation taking place in the early period of King Charles I's reign, and attacked one of his favourites, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham. He became embroiled in controversy when was one of the members to hold Speaker John Finch in his chair to prevent him adjourning parliament and preventing Eliot from denouncing such measures as tonnage and poundage. For this Valentine and his associates were arrested and tried. The trial revealed the clash between the rights and prerogatives of parliament versus the king, and became a political storm. Valentine refused to admit guilt or comply with orders, and was eventually fined and imprisoned for a number of years. Released prior to the resumption of parliament after eleven years of Personal Rule, Valentine returned to sit as a member, but took little part in the English Civil War. Origins Valentine's early origins are obscure but records of the baptism of a Benjamin Valentine at St Giles- without-Cripplegate on 9 March 1584 probably refer to the future parliamentarian. His family may have originated in Suffolk, and his father was perhaps a member of the Inner Temple in the early 1570s. Valentine can first be traced with surety in historical records in relation to some business transactions with his future father-in-law, Matthias Springham, in July 1610. He married Springham's daughter, Elizabeth, on 11 November 1610. Sir John Eliot, Valentine's political patron, who arranged his entry into Parliament Valentine established connections with several powerful figures at court, including by 1613 Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset, a favourite of James I. Somerset's fall from favour in 1615 reduced Valentine's influence, and he was briefly imprisoned for debt in 1619. Valentine then attached himself to the retinue of William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke and sought to undermine the royal favourite George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, with limited success. He became intimate with Sir John Eliot through his opposition to Buckingham, and Eliot arranged for him to be elected on 3 March 1628 to represent the borough of St. Germans in the Parliament of 1628‚Äì9. He used his place in parliament to mount further attacks on Buckingham, and as one biographer has stated, he was \\"clearly moving in circles hostile to both arbitrary government and High Church innovations\\". Confrontation and arrest He was in the House of Commons on 2 March 1629 when the Speaker, John Finch, would have obeyed King Charles I's direction for adjournment. Valentine, with Denzil Holles, held the Speaker down in his seat while Sir John Eliot read out resolutions questioning the king's proceedings respecting religion and taxation, particularly regarding tonnage and poundage. On 5 March, with John Selden and William Coryton, he was under examination at the Privy Council, and was committed to the Tower of London. John Finch, portrait by Sir Anthony van Dyck. Valentine held Finch in his chair during the 1629 session of Parliament, precipitating a political storm and his own arrest. On 17 March he was examined before a committee of the council, when he refused to answer any questions respecting acts done in Parliament. On 6 May he, with Selden, Holles, William Strode, Miles Hobart, and Walter Long, considering themselves legally entitled to bail, applied to the Court of King's Bench for a writ of habeas corpus. Such stringent conditions were, however, imposed that Valentine absolutely declined to comply with them, and refused to accept bail (3 October 1629). On 7 May an information was filed against him and others in the Star Chamber by the Attorney-General Robert Heath, but the prisoners were proceeded against in the Court of King's Bench. Valentine's 'plea and demurrer' to the information of the Attorney-General, prepared by his counsel, Robert Mason and Henry Calthorpe, was issued on 22 May, and was followed by a further plea on 1 June in answer to the altered information of 29 May. With Selden he should have appeared before the judges of the King's Bench on 24 June, had not the king reversed the order for fear that bail should be granted. On 13 October Heath brought in his information against Eliot, Holles, and Valentine in the Court of King's Bench. On 29 October the three prisoners were transferred from the Tower to the Marshalsea Prison. They appeared in court on 26 January 1630, and again the following day, when Valentine's case was pleaded by Calthorpe. Judgement was pronounced on 12 February, when Valentine was fined ¬£500. Confinement During the summer of 1630 Valentine, with Selden and Strode, was removed to the Gatehouse Prison on account of the sickness in the town. Through the leniency of their keeper they were frequently released on short paroles. They visited Eliot in the Tower, and passed whole weeks in the country in their own houses or in those of their friends. Returning to the Gatehouse towards the end of September, they were put into closer confinement, and their keeper fined ¬£100 and committed to the Marshalsea. Valentine continued a prisoner for eleven years, and was finally released in January 1640 to placate public opinion prior to the assembling of the Short Parliament. He was elected to represent St. Germans in the Long Parliament and took the Protestation on 5 May 1641, and the Covenant on 25 September 1643. He took little part in the ensuing civil war, though he supported the negotiations surrounding the Treaty of Newport in 1649. Later life Parliament granted him ¬£5,000 in 1647 in compensation for his losses, but Valentine only received half of the sum. He died in June 1652 and was buried at St Margaret's, Westminster on 9 June. Elizabeth, his wife, had been buried on 18 September 1616. The couple were survived by one son, Matthias, who died in the winter of 1654, and is described in his will as of St. Clement Danes, Middlesex.P. C. C., Alchin, 319 As one biographer has recorded, Valentine \\"does not appear to have been ultimately a committed revolutionary ... his place in history rests upon his actions, however factious or ideological, in dissenting from the Caroline regime of the late 1620s.\\" Notes a. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography suggests that Valentine may also have been a native of Cheshire.

He was active trading in and settling the American colonies of Massachusetts, Virginia and Carolina. Early life Vassal was the second son of John Vassall and his second wife, Anna Russell, and was baptised at Stepney on 5 June 1586. His father was a Huguenot refugee sent to England from Rinant in Normandy before August 1572 and who fitted out two ships, The Samuel and the Little Toby which he commanded against the Spanish Armada. Vassal lived for a time at Cockethurst Farmhouse, in what was then, Prittlewell, Essex, at the start of the 1600s. The house remained in the Vassal family until 1808. Merchant career Vassall became a merchant in London, and traded to New England, the West Indies, and Guinea. He was one of the incorporators of the first Massachusetts Company in March 1628, and in 1630 advanced ¬£50 for the enterprise. He and his brother William Vassall purchased as original proprietors, two-twentieths of all Massachusetts in New England. In September 1628 Vassall refused to pay to the custom-house the tonnage and poundage on a large quantity of currants which he was importing. The attorney-general exhibited an information in the exchequer against him, and Vassall pleaded his own cause and the illegality of the imposition. The barons of exchequer refused to hear Vassall's counsel in the case, asserting that it would fall under the same rule as the Bate case already adjudged. Vassall was imprisoned and his goods retained. In April 1630 he joined George, Lord Berkeley and others in an agreement to form a settlement in Virginia. In June 1630 he was again contending against the tonnage and poundage, having brought from Virginia to Tilbury a vessel laden ‚Äòwith that drug called tobacco‚Äô. In 1634 he was sued for breach of contract, after he had undertaken to carry some settlers to the new colony of Carolina, but through some mismanagement they had been deposited in October 1633 in Virginia, where they remained without further transport till the following May. Vassall was still imprisoned in the Fleet prison in 1636 while proceedings continued against him. He appears to have been released at the end of the year. Political career In April 1640, Vassall was elected Member of Parliament for City of London in the Short Parliament. In June of the same year he was summoned together with Richard Chambers by the council in order to be ‚Äòcommitted to some prisons in remote parts for seducing the King's people'. In November 1640 he was re-elected MP for the City of London in the Long Parliament and sat until he was excluded in 1648 under Pride's Purge. At this time he was styled clothier or clothworker. On 2 December Vassall \\"delivered his grievances by word of mouth\\" to the commons, and a committee was appointed to consider them. On 2 February 1641 the House of Commons ordered the farmers of the customs and imports to restitute to him the tobacco which had been seized. In July the committee meeting in the Star-chamber was still considering \\"of some fit way for reparation.\\" Vassall took the ‚Äòprotestation‚Äô on 3 May 1641. In 1642 he was one of the commissioners for plantations in the colonies, and as such in November took part in the appointment of Sir Thomas Warner as governor of the Caribbee Islands. He was one of the commissioners for the incorporation of Providence plantations in the Narraganset Bay in New England in 1643. He took the covenant on 22 September 1643. On 20 February 1645 he was one of the committee for the city of London for raising funds towards the maintenance of the Scottish army, and on 11 July 1646 he was named one of the commissioners for the kingdom of England for the conservation of peace between the two kingdoms. Early in 1650, as a trader to Guinea, he was giving information to the house about disputes between various merchants and the Guinea Company. With regard to Vassall's attempts to secure compensation for his losses and imprisonment, the matter was referred on 14 June 1644 to the committee for the navy, and on 18 January 1647 the commons voted him ¬£10,445 12s. 2d. He had also advanced money for the parliamentary forces in Ireland, and on 6 May 1647, ¬£2,591 17s. 6d., due to Vassall on this account, was ordered to be made chargeable on the grand excise, \\"with interest on the same‚Äô payable every six months\\". Vassall, however, received nothing. On 6 April 1654, in a petition presented to the Protector, he stated that as a result of resisting tonnage and poundage he had lost ¬£15,000, and begged leave to refund himself by means of privileges to import French wines, ship coals and lead, or receive forest land. The debt with interest now amounted to ¬£20,202 7s. 3d. On 6 May 1656 he was granted ¬£150 annually as interest on the debt formerly charged on the excise. On 26 May on the taking of a \\"Spanish prize\\" the council issued a warrant to pay him ¬£1,000. He was nevertheless informed on 8 September 1657 that he should make his application for payment to parliament, \\"as no revenue remains at his highness's disposal to satisfy the said debt.\\" On 18 March 1658 the petition was again read to the council, and again on 3 June 1658, at which time Vassall was a \\"prisoner in the upper bench.\\" On 1 April 1659 the commons recommended the Protector to grant a privy seal to pay him of ¬£500 as part of the debt and a bill was prepared for signature on 5 April. On 18 August 1660 it was ordered that the remainder of the debt should again be made chargeable on the excise, and \\"forthwith paid to Mr. Vassall.\\" Later life In 1663 Vassall was in Carolina making arrangements with the lords proprietors of the colony regarding a claim laid by him for part of a term not yet expired. He probably died in Massachusetts, but the exact time or place is not known. When letters of administration were granted in London to his son Francis on 24 September 1667, it was stated that he died abroad. Vassall married Frances Cartwright, daughter of Abraham and Joan Cartwright of St. Andrew's Undershaft, London. They had several children.VASSAL ANNEX Vassal Index References 1603 births 1670 deaths Members of the Parliament of England for the City of London English MPs 1640 (April) English MPs 1640‚Äì1648 Inmates of Fleet Prison ","title":"Samuel Vassall"},{"id":"30093205","text":"The South Shore Anchors Rugby Football Club is a rugby union team based in Weymouth, Massachusetts, United States.

It was formed in May 1690 when five Jacobite regiments were sent from Ireland to France in return for a larger force of French infantry who were sent to fight in the Williamite war in Ireland. The Irish Brigade served as part of the French Army until 1792. These five Jacobite regiments, comprising about 5000 men, were named after their colonels: Lord Mountcashel, Butler, Feilding, O'Brien and Dillon. They were largely inexperienced and the French immediately disbanded Butler's and Feilding's, either incorporating their men into the remaining three regiments or sending them back to Ireland. The remaining three regiments, Mountcashel's, O'Brien's and Dillon's, formed the Irish Brigade which served the French during the remainder of the Nine Years War (1689‚Äì97). The Wild Geese Under the terms of the Treaty of Limerick signed in October 1691, which ended the war between King James II and VII and King William III in Ireland, a separate force of 12,000 Jacobites arrived in France in an event known as Flight of the Wild Geese. These were kept separate from the Irish Brigade and were formed into King James's own army in exile, albeit in the pay of France. Lord Dorrington's regiment, later Rooth or Roth, following the Treaty of Ryswick in 1698, was formed from the former 1st and 2nd battalions James II's Royal Irish Foot Guards formerly on the Irish establishment of Britain.

The committee was established in 1953, following the enactment of the Judges Bill. The founding of the committee was intended to prevent outside political pressure, and so ensure the independence of the judges.  Appointment of judges before the committee's establishment  Cheshin, Dunkelblum, Smoira, Assaf, Olshan. Until the enactment of the Judges Bill, the Justice Minister appointed the judges. Only the appointment of judges to the Supreme Court needed approval of the Cabinet and the Knesset. When the State of Israel was established, the British judges appointed by the Mandate government left the country, but in most courts the Jewish judges remained, allowing the continued operation of the courts following the Declaration of Independence. In the Supreme Court only one Jewish judge, Gad Frumkin, was serving at the time. Pinchas Rosen, the first Justice Minister decided not to continue Frumkin's tenure, and appointed five new justices, who were confirmed by the provisional government and provisional state council in July 1948. The five judges were appointed on a partisan basis: the court president Moshe Smoira and Yitzhak Olshan were identified with Mapai; Menachem Dunkelblum was associated with the General Zionists; Rabbi Simcha Assaf represented the religious faction; and Zalman Cheshin was mistakenly considered to be a revisionist, although in fact he belonged to the Haganah.  Judges Bill  In 1952, the Knesset passed the Judges Bill, which stipulates methods of appointing judges (among other things). This bill proposed that the President will appoint the judges, at the suggestion of the Minister of Justice, in accordance with the recommendation by a committee of these ten members: the Justice Minister (committee chairman); another Cabinet minister; Chief justice and another judge of the Supreme Court; the Attorney General (who will be entitled to appoint in his place the Solicitor General); the Dean of the Faculty of Law in the Hebrew University; two Knesset members; and two members of the Law Council (now the Israel Bar Association).  Committee structure today  According to Basic Law: the Judiciary, established in 1984, The committee has nine members, as follows: * Justice Minister ‚Äì Chairman * Cabinet Minister, chosen by the Cabinet. * Two Knesset Members, chosen by the Knesset (Since 1992 they usually appoint one member from the coalition and one from the opposition). * Two members of the Bar Association (Usually selected by the two largest factions in the bureau). * The Chief Justice, and two other judges of the Supreme Court (replaced every three years by the panel of judges, the selection is usually by seniority).  The committee's current members ()  Representatives of the Supreme Court * Justice Miriam Naor ‚Äì Chief Justice. Member since 2009. * Judge Elyakim Rubinstein ‚Äì Supreme Court Deputy Chief Justice. Member since April 5, 2014. * Judge Esther Hayut ‚Äì Supreme Court Justice. Member since June 23, 2014. Bar Association representatives * Attorney Eilana Saker ‚Äì Member since 2015. * Attorney Halad Zoabi ‚Äì Head of Northern District in the Bar Association. Member since 2011. Israeli government officials * Avi Nissenkorn ‚Äì Justice Minister. * Moshe Kahlon Knesset representatives * MK Nurit Koren * MK Robert Elituv.  Judicial selection process  The process of electing the judges is regulated by the Rules of procedure of the Judicial Selection Committee, 1984. This process includes: * Application for election by the applicant. Includes filled questionnaire; resume; recommendations; etc. * Verification of recommendations by the court's administration. * Publishing the candidate list in Reshumot,See Example followed by a waiting period of at least 21 days in which every citizen may contact the committee before the hearing, with a reasoned explanation of opposition to a particular candidate. * Interview of the candidate by a subcommittee of the Judicial Selection Committee, containing at least three members (at least one judge, one attorney, and one MK). * Final decision by the Committee to confirm or reject a candidate. The Committee's decision to appoint a judge in all courts (except the Supreme Court), is passed by a simple majority of members present at the meeting. Appointing Supreme Court judges requires a majority of 7 of the 9 committee members, or two less than the number present at the meeting (6 of 8, 5 of 7, etc.). Confidentiality applies legally to the committee's deliberations and they are not published for public review. This confidential appointment process is unique, because the selection process for every other public office is required by law to register and publish minutes of the committee's meetings.  Controversy of the committee's composition  During the existence of the Judicial Committee the influence of the Supreme Court committee members was almost absolute: although they constitute only a third of the committee, they are the only cohesive and stable group, while the other members change frequently. Until the 1990s, the judges dominated the Committee through an alliance forged with representatives of the Bar Association. This system ‚Äì dubbed by some as the \\"friend brings a friend\\" cycle ‚Äì has been criticized by jurists and politicians, mainly aligned with the political right in Israel, who argued that the selection process does not properly represent public opinion, and that since the Supreme Court inevitably discusses politically disputed matters, the process impairs the principles of democracy. Some pushed for change in the process but were opposed by the fear that a change will eventually lead to politicization of the Judicial Selection, based on political views and affiliations rather than their professional and moral skills. One of the suggestions, by Mordechai Heller, was to go through the appointments system reminiscent of the federal courts in the United States, and to some extent the method that was used in Israel before 1953: authorizing the Prime Minister to propose candidates, and appoint them by Knesset authority, after a public hearing process (this was suggested at the time when there were direct prime minister elections in Israel, according to which Heller viewed the prime minister's office and the Knesset as two independent authorities, a distinction that is now obsolete since the prime minister is no longer elected directly). He even raised the possibility of adding a professional committee to ensure that candidates meet the appropriate qualification level. Prior to his appointment as Justice Minister, Professor Daniel Friedmann wrote that it's crucial to change something in the composition of the committee. He proposed that instead of selecting all three judges to the committee from the Supreme Court, two shall be district court judges or retired district court judges. Some of the benefits would be dispersed authority (preventing a powerful positioning of a relatively small group of Supreme Court justices in driving the whole judicial system); more objective approach to candidates; and that the district judges will be better acquainted with the candidates for lower courts whom they have to appoint. In contrast, the Israeli Democracy Institute supports leaving the status quo intact, and includes the existing system in its proposed Constitution without any changes. The Head of the Bar Association, Yuri Guy-Ron, also supports keeping the existing pattern. (Retired) Chief Justice, Aharon Barak strongly condemned the proposed changes in selecting judges. He argued that although the Israeli system is not free of problems, it still tops all the suggestions to improve it, and that on this matter it's better that other countries learn from Israel and not the opposite. Several Knesset members tried at different times to change the legislation the committee structure, including David Tal and Michael Eitan, at the time chairman of the Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice committee, but their proposals didn't gather enough support. Daniel Friedmann was appointed Justice Minister in February 2007. Critical of the judicial system before, and an outspoken opponent of the Supreme Court and the committee's selection process, he was appointed by, then Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert to shake up the judicial system. His opponents criticized his appointment as a political maneuver to influence the judicial system, specifically the case against Olmert's close friend and important ally, and Friedmann's predecessor as Justice Minister, Haim Ramon. Friedmann criticized the court's handling of the Ramon affair in an article just days prior to his appointment; he later also criticized the guilty verdict on Ramon. Friedmann proposed some fundamental changes to the committee, including the number of members and the way they are selected.

Barak even said about some of Friedmann's proposals that they are like \\"holding a gun to the head of the Supreme Court\\". In the end, he succeeded in implementing some of his proposed changes, but the system's critics still charged that it wasn't nearly enough.

The school's principal, Verge, places them all in detention until 10 PM on the night of prom, certain that one of them is the killer. While in detention they discover that the school's stuffed bear mascot is actually a time machine and that the world is supposed to end in 1992 as a result of Ione's mother Sloane refusing to go to prom with Verge. It's also revealed that \\"Ione\\" is actually Sloane, who managed to swap bodies with her daughter and that the real Ione is in Sloane's body in 1992. Via her daughter's body Sloan stole Riley's crush Clapton, causing strife in their friendship. They use the bear to time travel to 1992, where Ione tells them that she wants to remain in 1992, as she has become very popular due to knowing all of the trends. They also learn that Sander is the true killer and that Verge destroyed the world with his help. Although reluctant, Ione agrees to go to the prom with Verge, who agrees not to destroy the world. Riley also takes advantage of the time travel to keep her father from becoming an alcoholic. After they return they discover that while the time travel did have some changes, the murders still occurred. Riley and Clapton, who had become a couple after the revelations of Ione/Sloan, are attacked by a jealous Sander. The three battle and Sander is killed after he is impaled on the bear mascot's fangs.

The mining industry, after 1900, was seeking to exploit lower-grade iron deposits to meet the increasing demand of the iron and steel industry. To bring the ore to customers' specifications, the mines sought to \\"beneficiate\\" the ore through sintering, crushing, and washing. The sintering process was unique to the Cuyuna Range and made it possible to economically support mining. The plant sits on the west shore of Portsmouth Mine Pit Lake, formerly an open mine pit. The plant contained eight structures at the time of nomination. The sintering structure and trestle consists of a tall, concrete structure, adjacent to a trestle that supported rail cars that were unloaded into the sintering chamber. The machine shops building was located immediately east of the sintering structure and trestle, and is built of steel with corrugated metal sheathing.

It was a New York Times best seller. In the book, the authors tackle the problem of scientific illiteracy in America. The authors criticize scientists for talking down to the misinformed and insulting the religious while calling for more friendly and magnanimous science advocates. They also blame the New Atheist movement, the creation‚Äìevolution controversy, the entertainment industry, the media, and science skeptics. Reception Science press The journal Science Communication gave the book a favourable review, noting that the arguments presented \\"may make the Ph.D. crowd even more cranky than usual.\\" Indeed, the book did spark significant debate particularly on-line. Seed magazine selected Unscientific America as one to \\"read now\\" although it was subsequently more critical of certain aspects of the book. The BMJ, while supporting the authors' assessment of the problem, was critical of the proposed solution. It said that the book sometimes \\"reads like an overlong and somewhat condescending whine about why science and scientists are not sufficiently appreciated.\\" The New Scientist was similarly supportive of the description of the problem while being critical of the solution arguing that \\"by looking only at science, Unscientific America misses the big picture.\\" American Scientist called it \\"at best, a thin and unsatisfying broth.\\" Science was also critical calling the book \\"slight in both length and substance\\" and the analysis it contains \\"shallow and unreflective\\". This review was itself criticized by Donald Marcus of Baylor College of Medicine, who called it \\"a dismissive rant that misrepresents the text.\\" PZ Myers, who was criticised in the book, stated in his review that \\"It's not a badly written book, but it's something worse: it's utterly useless.\\" Other media California Bookwatch gave it a positive review. Kenneth Krause gave it a mixed to negative review in The Humanist criticizing the lack of an explanation of \\"how we can interest and invest the popular media in the serious science their viewers and subscribers have so evidently rejected\\" while characterizing the book with Chicken Little analogies. In the popular press Gerry Rising of The Buffalo News wrote, \\"This important book makes clear that the turn back toward science after the strong opposition of the Bush administration, [...], falls far short of solving our nation's problems.\\" National Defense magazine said the authors had \\"captured the current zietgeist\\" in an analysis of the challenges of recruiting and retaining qualified young professionals in the defense industry.

They played in the Eastern Hockey League from 1964‚Äì1972, when they folded. They were the first professional hockey team to be based in Florida. They played most of their home games at the Jacksonville Coliseum; from 1966‚Äì68 they were known as the Florida Rockets, playing some of their home games in St. Petersburg, Florida. History The Rockets joined the Eastern Hockey League (EHL) in 1964, becoming Jacksonville's first professional ice hockey team and the first professional team in Florida. The league decided to expand into Florida and other Southern states after the unexpected success of the Charlotte Checkers in Charlotte, North Carolina. Organizers chose Jacksonville as the Jacksonville Coliseum was one of the few arenas in Florida equipped for ice hockey. For most of their existence, the Rockets were coached by Bob Sabourin, who initially joined the team as a player and subsequently became the head coach and general manager. The Rockets faced an uphill battle in attracting fans, as at the time hockey had made few inroads in the southern United States. A contemporary article in the Jacksonville Journal commented that when the Rockets began play, locals \\"didn't know a hockey puck from a bedwarmer or a hockey stick from a shepherd's staff.\\" Sabourin and the team launched a number of ventures to promote the sport, organizing youth leagues and skating lessons at the Coliseum. Beginning in the 1965‚Äì1966 season they played some of their home games at the Bayfront Arena in St. Petersburg, Florida. In 1966 the Rockets hoped to add West Palm Beach as a home city as well, and they changed their name to the Florida Rockets to reflect their new \\"all-Florida\\" status. However, the West Palm Beach games were cancelled due to construction delays, and the team resumed their original name in 1968. The Rockets fielded mostly losing teams and drew modest crowds for most of their run. They drew sellout and near-sellout crowds in Jacksonville in 1967, when they were in contention for the EHL championship. Otherwise, they averaged around 2,500 spectators per game. The Rockets finally folded in 1972 due to economic pressures. They were followed by the American Hockey League's Jacksonville Barons, who relocated from Cleveland, Ohio in 1973. The Barons folded at the end of the 1973‚Äì1974 season, and Jacksonville did not have a hockey team for nearly two decades. Bob Sabourin remained in Jacksonville, promoting concerts, professional wrestling and other events. He eventually opened his own skating rink and owned another minor league hockey team, the Jacksonville Bullets.

It was a two-seat single engined biplane built for the Imperial Japanese Navy. Only two were built. Design and development In 1933, the Imperial Japanese Navy issued a specification for a replacement for the Nakajima E4N shipboard reconnaissance floatplane. Aichi prepared two designs, the AM-7, a low-winged monoplane powered by a Bristol Mercury radial engine and the AB-7, a more conventional biplane, powered by a license-built Bristol Jupiter engine. The monoplane design was soon abandoned as its promised performance was little better than that of the aircraft it was meant to replace, but two examples of the AB-7 were built as the Experimental 8-Shi Reconnaissance Seaplane, or E8A under the Short System designation system.Mikesh and Abe 1990, p. 74. The AB-7 was a single-bay biplane of wood and metal construction, fitted with a single main float that could be replaced be a wheeled undercarriage for operations from land. Its wings folded to the rear to allow easier storage aboard ship. The pilot sat in an open cockpit while the observer's cockpit was part-enclosed to protect him from the environment. The Aichi design was evaluated against competing aircraft from Kawanishi, the E8K, a low-winged monoplane similar to the Aichi AM-7,Mikesh and Abe 1990, p. 137‚Äì138. and Nakajima, the biplane E8N. While the E8A had similar performance to the E8N, the Nakajima biplane had superior manoevrability and handling, and was preferred to both the Nakajima and Kawanishi offerings, with over 700 E8Ns built.Francillon 1970, pp. 408‚Äì410.

It is one of Goya's 14 Black Paintings (Pinturas negras) painted late in his life when, living alone in physical pain, spiritual torment and disillusionment with the political direction of Spain, he painted 14 bleak, agonised frescoes onto the walls of the Quinta del Sordo (House of the deaf man), the house he was living in alone outside Madrid. As with the others in the series, it was transferred to canvas in 1873-74 under the supervision of Salvador Mart√≠nez Cubells, a curator at the Museo del Prado. The owner, Baron Emile d'Erlanger, donated the work to the Spanish state in 1881, and they are now on display at the Prado.Hughes, 16‚Äì17 Description Men Reading shows a group of six men huddled together reading a printed page held in the lap of a seated central figure. Although it is not known for certain, they are often thought to be politicians reading, and passing comments on, a newspaper article about themselves. Goya most likely placed the work on a smaller wall of the first floor of the Quinto, next to its companion piece Women Laughing and opposite The Dog and Two Old Men Eating Soup.Junquera, 43 Women Laughing is often seen as a companion work, a feminine counterpart to Men Reading X-ray reveals that the image was dramatically altered before Goya settled on what is now on the canvas. At some stage a landscape in the background showed a mounted rider. The central figure in white at one point had large horns, or possibly bird wings, seemingly growing out of his head.Junquera, 78 From studying the x-rays art historian Carmen Garrido discovered that the center of the image contained a large white lead impasto beginning at the head of the man looking upwards, and that \\"both the part on top of the impasto and that which is level with the rest of the painting are identical, and have neither the texture nor the normal structure of the authentic brushstrokes of the painter.\\" Thematically and stylistically it shares characteristics with another work from the Black Paintings series, Women Laughing. Both are vertical rather than horizontal and smaller in scale than the other works. Both are thematically less dark than the other works in the series, although they are chromatically darker.Fern√°ndez, G. \\"Goya: The Black Paintings\\". theartwolf.com, August 2006. Retrieved 15 January 2010. Both are lit by identical light falling from the upper left of the pictorial space. Women Laughing shows two hags mocking a man in the act of masturbating, while in Men reading, according to writer Francisco-Xavier de Salas Bosch, \\"the incessant talk of the politicians...was perhaps, in Goya‚Äôs eyes, as sterile as the solitary pleasure which the women are making fun of.\\"de Salas Bosch References Bibliography * de Salas Bosch, Francisco-Xavier.

Fawcett, also known as \\"Captain Billy\\", started the book \\"Captain Billy's Whiz Bang\\" as a joke book for soldiers during World War I. He formed Fawcett Publications in 1919 in Robbinsdale, Minnesota. In 1920, he bought a tract of land where the present-day Breezy Point Resort is located, and he began building cottages and a large log lodge. The lodge has since burnt down. He built the Fawcett House as a private residence within the resort property. Fawcett hired the Minneapolis architects of Magney and Tusler and commissioned the design in the Swiss Chateau style. The rustic log style was a bit ironic, since the local logging industry had declined before the resort was built.National Register of Historic Places nomination form, Robert M. Frame III, Minnesota Historical Society, March 19, 1980. The house is located on a point on Breezy Point Bay on Big Pelican Lake. It has a \\"Y\\" shape. The center of the \\"Y\\" has a circular staircase leading to a \\"reading balcony\\" in the main hall. The building is constructed of peeled and trimmed Norway pine logs, with brown stain on the exterior and varnished on the interior.

The remainder of the house has room for about 30 guests. In 1979, a fire damaged several rooms in the northwest wing, but the exterior was unharmed.

The family moved to the village of Ekset in Volda when she was four years old. Berte Canutte gained knowledge of the pietism teachings of Hans Nielsen Hauge as a small child, and around 1800 joined a small circle of Haugeans led by Vebj√∏rn Svendsen in Volda.Vebj√∏rn Svendsen (Ministerialbok for Volda prestegjeld, √òrsta sokn 1877-1889) Berte Canutte learned writing at home and by maintaining letter correspondence with fellow Haugeans. At the age of twelve, Berte Canutte started writing spiritual hymns. Her father was a newspaper publisher who had set up the first library and printing house in the village. He was impressed by her writings and in the last of his life recommended she publish them for a larger audience. He recommended the title En gudelskende Siels opbyggelige Sange (A God-Worshiping Soul's Edifying Hymns). The booklet was released in 1820 by her older brother Rasmus Aarflot (1792‚Äì1845), who continued the Aarflot printing firm after the death of their father in 1817.Velkomen til Sivert Aarflot - museet (sivertaarflot) Sivert Aarflot - Bonde, Lensmann og Trykkerieier (Norsk biografisk leksikon.

They maintained a farm at √Örflot from 1819 to 1852, and together had seven children. The farm hosted gatherings for fellow Haugeans. In 1822, a visit with the lay minister Amund Knutsson Brekke (1776-1835) from the island of Gursk√∏ya inspired Berte Canutte to remain a humble and loyal servant of Jesus Christ in her writing and speech. She continued with her spiritual writings throughout the remainder of her life. Berte Canutte Aarflot died of brain hemorrhage in 1859. Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson wrote the following about her in Aftenbladet: > This affectionate woman has lived for the edification of the many.

Education and early career Pernet was born in Washington, D.C. on October 8th, and received a degree in documentary filmmaking from Temple University. In addition to creating several films of her own, she has maintained a love for cinema ever since. Becoming a New York City fashion designer in the 1980s, she maintained a label of her own for 13 years. Relocating to Paris in 1990, Diane Pernet's first job there was as a costume designer for director Amos Gitai and his film Golem, l'Esprit d'Exile. Her work for the CBC‚Äôs Fashion File programme led to an appointment at Hong Kong Joyce magazine, where she was the women's fashion editor for five years. Fashion Blog Pioneer Embracing fully the late-90s internet revolution, Diane took on a ‚ÄúDr. Diane‚Äù fashion-advice column at Elle.com, and covered the runways for Vogue.fr.Diane Pernet 2009 press release, p. 2 Success in these endeavours led to the creation of one of the internet's first fashion blogs in 2005, A Shaded View on Fashion (ASVOF), an online fashion platform whose early success led The New York Times to anoint her \\"the original style blogger\\". Also prolific on other social media platforms, she influences thousands with her daily fashion news and updates. Rocco Leo Gaglioti and Diane Pernet signed a deal to create A Shaded View on Fashion TV channel on the FNL Network. A Shaded View on Fashion (ASVOF) Season 12 will be broadcast only on the FNL Network October 6, 2020 Fashion film In September 2006, to promote the launch of his brand's menswear line, Mark Eley of Eley Kishimoto commissioned her to make a documentary around a \\"Gumball 3000\\" (or \\"Gumball Rally\\") road- trip between London and Monte Carlo. It was this project and the interest that it generated that rekindled her love for cinema and motivated her to invent the 'fashion film' genre. Rather than exploring the idea through actual film- making, she decided to make it an open celebration in which anyone who shared her interest could participate. This was the genesis of her first \\"You Wear it Well\\" fashion-film festival that she, with photographer Dino Dinco, curated at the Los Angeles CineSpace from the 1st of August 2006. This brainchild developed into a three-day \\"A Shaded View on Fashion Film\\" (ASVOFF) festival that was showcased for the first time in September 2008 at Paris' Jeu de Paume museum. With fashion film as a centrepiece, ASVOFF developed into a yearly travelling international event with satellite conferences, performances and exhibitions. Pernet has used the ASVOFF platform to support the photo-to-film transition for fashion mavericks including Nick Knight and Steven Klein. { \\"type\\": \\"FeatureCollection\\", \\"features\\": [ {

He was part of the team that won the gold medal in the men's eight competition at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, he and the team also have won three World Rowing Championship titles and also four European Rowing Championship titles. Career Richard Schmidt rowed for Ruderverein Treviris 1921 in Trier, Germany. At the junior level, he won two medals at the World Rowing Junior Championships in 2004 and 2005. In 2007, he rowed in the men's World Rowing U23 Championships in Glasgow in the coxless four together with Sebastian Schmidt, Fokke Beckman and Kristof Wilke in which they won a gold medal. During Autumn of 2007, the team managed to take home second place at the European Rowing Championships in Pozna≈Ñ after taking a long break from the sport. In 2008, Schmidt rowed with Fokke Beckman at the World Cup opener in Munich in the coxless pair and at the end of the season was nominated to row for the German eight in the U23 World Championship, in which the team placed fourth. During this time, the positioning of the German eight boat was reorganised prior to the 2008 Olympic Games, Schmidt was nominated as a substitute for Beijing. He then moved on to the semi-finals with Marco Neumann, Gregor Hauffe, and Urs K√§ufer in the coxless four as Filip Adamski and Toni Seifert were ill. The newly composed team had surprisingly reached the finale, however, Neumann was then replaced with Jochen Urban. The boat finished in 6th place. In the new Olympic cycle, the coxless four formed the core of the newly founded German eight, with which Schmidt won his first international title at the 2009 World Rowing Championships. In 2010, he rowed in the champion coxless pair for the first time with Kristof Wilke. The German eight in which he firmly established himself as a rower, rowed in the European Championships in September and then the World Championships in November. With Schmidt on board, the German team won their third consecutive title at the 2011 World Championships. At the 2012 Olympics in London, the favoured German eight won the gold medal with a boat consisting of Filip Adamski, Andreas Kuffner, Eric Johannesen, Maximilian Reinelt, Richard Schmidt, Lukas M√ºller, Florian Mennigen, Kristof Wilke and coxswain Martin Sauer. After the success at the Olympics, Richard Schmidt continued his career in rowing and remained a fixed part of the German eight who are now noted as strong, permanent rivals against the British Rowing team. During the years 2013 to 2015, the German team was able to win gold each year consecutively at the European Rowing Championships. In the World Championship finals, for the last three years the eight from the United Kingdom was faster and took three gold medals, the German eight placed second each year. So the German eight with Schmidt on board, therefore, won three consecutive silver medals.

Background  Arezzo was a powerful city state in Medieval Italy. It wanted control of the Province of Siena, but there were already inhabitants, the people of Siena. And so the only choice was war. An excuse was easy to make; Arezzo was Ghibelline, and Siena was Guelph. The two sides were at war in the Wars of the Guelphs and Ghibellines, and Arezzo was given the absolute right to invade Siena.  Battle  The aggressors went looking for battle. They found a force of Guelphs awaiting them at the fields of Pieve al Toppo, in Tuscany. The two sides engaged, and Arezzo emerged as the winner of the battle.  Aftermath  After the Battle of Pieve al Toppo, the victors burnt the town of Civitella in Val di Chiana, wrecking or damaging all of the buildings. In the years in the wake of the battle, the city-state of Florence swept off the Arezzo territories in the Province of Siena, and took over the city in 1289. This was because of the defeat of Arezzo by the Guelphs at the Battle of Campaldino. Arezzo found itself at war with Florence, and the city fell after a short battle in 1311.

It is located on Minnesota State Highway 1 about one mile east of Isabella. The complex is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its association with New Deal federal relief construction.National Register of Historic Places nomination form, William J. Clayton and Lee R. Johnson, USDA Forest Service, Superior National Forest, Duluth, MN. August 2005. Of the 21 buildings, 11 are listed as contributing properties to the district. These were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the mid-1930s and were built of horizontally- laid wood logs, mostly aspen and pine. These buildings consist of dwellings, an office building, storage facilities, and warehouses. Some other buildings on the site were constructed after the CCC built the original complex, and are not considered contributing properties. The ranger station is nationally significant for its use as an administration center that supported multiple federal land management functions within the Isabella Ranger District of the Superior National Forest. The rustic architecture is also significant because it was common to the design of land management administrative buildings within this time period. The historic context of the Superior National Forest began with a recommendation by General C.C. Andrews that all of the public land within Cook County, Minnesota and Lake County, Minnesota, totaling around , should be preserved as a forest reserve. On February 13, 1909, President Theodore Roosevelt established the Superior National Forest with an area of . Additional proclamations raised the size of the forest to . During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps was formed to provide relief for unemployment, and also to stimulate local economies through federally funded, grassroots development projects. The Isabella guard station served as a facility for crews that were working in an often roadless area within the Superior National Forest. While crews and their assignments changed frequently, CCC Company 701, based in Ely, Minnesota, and Company 3703, based in Baptism River, Minnesota were confirmed to be involved in the construction of this station. Other surviving guard stations include the East Bearskin Lake Guard Station, near Gunflint; Crooked Lake Guard Station, near LaCroix; Halfway/North Central Experiment Station; Kekekabic Lake Guard Station; Lac LaCroix Guard Station; Sawbill Lake Guard Station; South Kawishiwi River Pavilion; and Tofte Ranger Station.

It was rated at up to , but more usually in the range. Design and development The Algol was a conventionally laid out radial engine, with nine cylinders in a single row. The crankcase was a barrel-shaped aluminium alloy casting, with an internal integral diaphragm which held the front crankshaft bearing. Forward of the diaphragm there was an integrally cast cam-gear case for the double track cam-ring. The reduction gear was housed under a domed casing attached to the front of the crankcase. Flange- mounted steel barrels were bolted to the crankcase and enclosed with cast aluminium alloy, screwed-on, cylinder head with integral cooling fins. The pistons were also made of aluminium alloy and had floating gudgeon pins. The nine pistons drove the single throw crankshaft via one channel-section master rod and eight circular section auxiliary rods. The master rod had an integral, split type big-end. The crankshaft was machined from a single forging, with bolt-on balance weights. The Algol had a single pair of overhead inlet and exhaust valves per cylinder. The cam-ring drove roller tappets, mounted in the cam-case, which in turn operated rocker arms, fitted with ball bearings, via pushrods.

The Association is an international body open to scholars world-wide, and currently has over 100 members. Since the Association's inception, the methodologies of laboratory phonology are emerging as the dominant approach to the study of sound systems in universities in North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and many other locations. In this way, the success of the approach promoted by the Association for Laboratory Phonology can be attributed to its interdisciplinary nature: bridging linguistics with psychology, computer science, etc., and defining the relationship between the cognitive and physical aspects of human speech as a question of cognitive science.Cohn, Abigail. Phonology: An Appraisal of the Field in 2007, Presented at the Annual Meeting of the Linguistic Society of America. January 5, 2007. Anaheim, CA. Meetings The biennial Conference on Laboratory Phonology (LabPhon) brings together researchers across the many relevant disciplines to present work on the phonological patterns and structures of natural languages. All oral paper sessions are plenary, and are organized to promote discussion across the disciplines. Each session groups together invited and submitted talks on a conference theme and ends with a talk by an invited discussant followed by an open discussion by the entire conference audience. Since the second conference in 1989, there have also been one or more poster sessions, which also are plenary. Conferences generally have between four and six themes, which are broadly defined in order to bring together speakers and commentators from different disciplines and theoretical backgrounds. Publications The proceedings of the Conference on Laboratory Phonology were published as Papers in Laboratory Phonology by Cambridge University Press from 1991 (Vol 1) to 2004 (Vol 6). Beginning with Vol 7, the series was renamed to Laboratory Phonology and published by Mouton de Gruyter. After the publication of Laboratory Phonology 10 in 2010, the book series was replaced by the journal Laboratory Phonology. The first six volumes of the journal were published by Mouton de Gruyter, and then starting with volume 7 in 2016, the journal moved to Ubiquity Press, to become an online-only, open-access publication. The journal encompasses the scientific study of the elements of oral language, their organization, their grammatical function, and their role in speech communication. Research questions and some of the methods addressed in the publications also extend naturally to the parallel investigation of manual signs as the encoding elements of sign languages.

Following the signing of the Treaty of Zboriv in 1649 it consisted a total of 21 companies, and had 2,100 registered Cossacks. During the uprising the regiment took part in the Battle of Berestechko in 1651. When a civil war emerged among the cossacks the Hetmanate was split along the Dnieper River into Left-bank Ukraine and Right- bank Ukraine, which placed the regiment under the control of Left-bank Ukraine hetmans. The regiment was involved in successfully suppressing Martyn Pushkar's revolt against the Vyhovsky government. After the Treaty of Andrusovo in 1667, the Tsardom of Russia gained sovereignty over Left-bank Ukraine and its regiments came under the administration of Russia. In 1782 the regiment had 11 companies and a population of 69,200. In 1782 the regiment was disbanded by the order of the Empress Catherine the Great.

Dating from 1804, it is one of several such white horses to be seen around Great Britain, and one of nine in Wiltshire.Morris Marples, White Horses & Other Hill Figures (London: Country Life Ltd, 1949; New York, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1949) Many distant views of the horse are obstructed by trees, but it can be seen from parts of the town of Marlborough. One good view is from a footpath running from Preshute House to the A345 road. The figure is some 500 metres south of Marlborough College, within 100 metres of the southeast corner of the college sportsground. History The smallest such horse in Wiltshire, the Marlborough horse was cut in 1804 by boys at Mr Greasley's Academy, also called the High Street Academy,The Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine, vol. 98 (2005), p. 91: \\"Following the cutting of Marlborough White Horse in 1804 by pupils of the High Street Academy, scouring with revels took place every year for approximately 30 years but halted upon the headmaster's death.\\" ‚Äì via Internet Archive a school in Marlborough High Street which occupied the building now The Ivy House Hotel. This was not the present-day Marlborough College, which is only a short distance away. The horse was designed and marked out on the hill by a boy called William Canning, whose family owned the Manor House at Ogbourne St George. From then onwards, it was \\"scoured\\", or cleaned up, every year, this becoming a tradition at the school marked by revelry.Marlborough at wiltshirewhitehorses.org.ukMorris Marples, White horses and other hill figures (1981 reprint), p. 91: \\"The scouring of the Marlborough horse was carried out every year by the boys of Mr Greasley's academy so long as it continued in existence, and we are told that the ceremony was one of the most cherished traditions of the school. One can well imagine that it called for a holiday and appropriate celebrations.\\" Greasley died about 1830, and the school was closed, leading to the horse being neglected for some years, but by 1860 it was back in good condition and can be seen in a photograph taken that year at a cricket match. In 1873 a Captain Reed, an old boy of Greasley's Academy who had taken part in the horse's creation, saw to a new scouring. The horse is 62 feet long by 47 high, and it has got thinner since the early twentieth century. It was restored again in September 2001, when it was re-chalked with pure chalk mixed with water and applied with a stiff brush, but by the late summer of 2002 it already had grass growing on much of its surface. A verse of the Marlborough College school song refers to the horse: For a while in 1969, the horse was not the only hill figure in Marlborough, as the Scout logo was cut into a nearby hill, commemorating the Marlborough Group's Diamond Jubilee. As no permission was granted for the figure to be permanent, the land's owners replanted plants on it later in the year.Marlborough Scout Logo Inspiration The horse may have been inspired by the nearby Cherhill White Horse, which itself was probably created in imitation of the first such Wiltshire horse, at Westbury, remodelled in the 1770s. It is unclear whether the Westbury horse is ancient, but the Uffington horse, now in Oxfordshire, has been shown to date from the Bronze Age. The earliest evidence of the Westbury horse is in a paper of the Rev. Francis Wise published in 1742, which refers to it.Francis Wise, Further Observations on the White Horse and other Antiquities in Berkshire (1742) See also * Hill figure * Cherhill White Horse * Westbury White Horse References Bibliography * William Plenderleath, On the White Horses of Wiltshire and Its Neighbourhood (Wilts Archaeological Magazine, vol. 14 for the year 1872, pp. 12‚Äì30) *Rev.

L. Doctorow and inspired by Dolly Parton's titular song. It marked Jessica Chastain's film debut. It premiered on June 13, 2008 at the Seattle International Film Festival and was later released in the United States on October 29, 2010. Plot 15-year-old orphan Jolene breaks free from foster care, marrying Mickey, a nerdy 20-year-old. They live with Mickey's Uncle Phil and Aunt Kay. On the night before her sixteenth birthday, Jolene asks Mickey about his mother, but he rebuffs her and starts crying. To make him feel better, she seduces him, but Mickey's inexperience leads to uncomfortable and joyless sex. The next day, Mickey and Uncle Phil wish Jolene \\"Happy Birthday\\" with Kay asking Jolene to clean the floor. Phil walks in with Jolene and they have sex. They start a passionate affair, and Phil promises to build a house for the two of them, but asks Jolene to keep their relationship secret. Upon catching Phil and Jolene in bed, Kay sends Jolene out of the house. As Phil and Kay argue, Mickey kills himself by jumping off a bridge. Aunt Kay has Jolene placed in a juvenile mental institution, where she meets Cindy, a psychiatric nurse. Jolene, a talented artist, asks for paper and colored pencils to draw. Her request is denied, but she is allowed crayons, and she starts a small business selling crayon portraits to her fellow patients. Jolene is called to testify against Uncle Phil, and he is sentenced to eighteen months in prison for statutory rape. Cindy, a lesbian, is immediately infatuated with Jolene and this culminates in another affair. Cindy breaks Jolene out of the mental hospital and hides her in her apartment. Using the money from her portraits, Jolene leaves and boards a bus west out of South Carolina. Jolene resorts to hitchhiking further west, supporting herself by prostitution. Jolene ends up in Arizona, working as a waitress at an outdoor diner. There, she meets Coco Leger, an aspiring musician and tattoo artist. A relationship blooms between them and Jolene becomes a tattoo artist at Coco's parlor. After two weeks of dating, Jolene moves in with Coco and he convinces her to get married. After he passes out during sex, Coco is revealed to have a cocaine addiction, supporting his habit and the parlor by dealing cocaine. One evening, a young woman enters the parlor and declares herself to be his wife, Marin. She introduces his son, Coco Jr. Coco returns and is confronted by both women before he walks out with Marin and the baby. Jolene destroys the parlor, dumps the cocaine on a table, steals the drug money and dumps her ring in the center of the cocaine, before dialing 911 and fleeing the scene. Jolene later is in Las Vegas, working as an erotic dancer when she meets Sal Fontaine, a mobster. He takes a liking to her and invites her to quit dancing and move into his high rise condo. Jolene enjoys a life of luxury with Sal, going to fancy dinners and exploring her talent as an artist. One night, Sal demands that Jolene get dressed, go downstairs and wait for him. She falls asleep in the restaurant and quietly returns to the condo to find Sal dead and the mob looking for her. Jolene escapes and ends up hitchhiking on a truck to Tulsa. In Tulsa, Jolene finds work as a receptionist and banquet server. She meets Brad Benton, the son of a wealthy family. He relentlessly pursues her, sending flowers to her workplace and charming her into dates. Outwardly religious but obnoxiously arrogant, he is rude, entitled and demanding to everyone. Brad pressures Jolene into quickly getting married and anally rapes her on their wedding night. When Jolene becomes pregnant, Brad interrogates her on how many people she has had sex with; when she refuses to comply, he slaps her across the face. After the baby is born, Brad's parents investigate Jolene's past and inform him. He then brutally attacks her, permanently damaging her vocal cords. She tries to leave and take Brad Jr., but a domestic violence lawyer refuses to take her case due to her past. While staying in a shelter for battered women, the police come and arrest Jolene for kidnapping and Brad is granted an annulment. Jolene is convicted of the kidnapping and is allowed supervised visits. She decides to exit her baby's life while he is an infant, reasoning that he can imagine his mother to be anybody. Finally, Jolene ends up in Los Angeles, working as a comic illustrator for a graphic novel company, where she incorporates events from her life into her work. In her final narration, she reveals that she has dreams to be an actress and that a film studio might want to use her. Seeing a woman walking her young son up the street, Jolene imagines herself a famous actress returning to Tulsa in a limousine to visit her son and happily walks out of frame. Cast Brothers Avi Angel and Asher Angel appeared briefly as Brad Jr. at 7 months and 5 years old, respectively. Reception The film received a mixed critical reaction.

Overview Royal Bank was a privately owned financial institution and small financial services provider in Zimbabwe. , the bank's total asset valuation is not publicly known. The shareholder's equity in the bank was estimated at about US$12.5 million, the minimum capital requirement for a commercial bank in Zimbabwe, effective December 2010. History The bank was founded in 2001. In 2004, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), the national banking regulator, closed the bank down, together with Barbican Bank and Trust Banking Corporation. The assets of the three shuttered banks, were merged, to form Zimbabwe Allied Banking Group (ZABG). In September 2010, the RBZ reversed its decision and reissued the commercial banking licences of the three banks that had been closed. Royal Bank reopened in February 2011, after six years of enforced closure. ZABG also retained its banking licence. , the number of licensed commercial banks in Zimbabwe, was nineteen. In March 2012, Zimbabwean media reported that Commercial Bank of Africa Group, a Kenyan financial services conglomerate, had agreed to acquire a 62% stake in Royal Bank of Zimbabwe.Royal Bank Finalising Deal With Kenyan InvestorRoyal Bank Meets Capital Requirements However, both parties failed to finalise on the deal within the allowed regulatory time frame thus the deal lapsed. Closure and liquidation On July 27, 2012, the board of directors of Royal Bank Zimbabwe resolved to surrender the institution's banking licence to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and shut down its business in the country. This followed the determination by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe that Royal Bank was no longer in a \\"safe and sound financial condition\\".

Although Bhutan has a state religion, the role of the religious bureaucracy ideally complements secular institutions within a dual system of government. Composition and function Under the 2008 Constitution, the Dratshang Lhentshog is made up of seven members: the Je Khenpo as Chairman; the Five Lopons (Dzongkha: ‡Ω¶‡æ≥‡Ωº‡Ωñ‡ºã‡Ωë‡Ωî‡Ωº‡Ωì‡ºã‡Ω£‡æî‡ºã; Wylie: slob-dpon lnga) of the Zhung Dratshang (Dzongkha: ‡ΩÇ‡Ωû‡Ω¥‡ΩÑ‡ºã‡ΩÇ‡æ≤‡æ≠‡ºã‡Ωö‡ΩÑ‡ºã; Wylie: gzhung grwa- tshang; \\"Central Monastic Body\\"); and a civil servant Secretary. Under the 2008 Constitution, it is mandated that the Zhung Dratshang and rabdeys (monastic bodies in dzongs other than Punakha and Thimphu) receive state funding and facilities adequate to support the Drukpa Kagyu sect. The Five Lopons recommend a learned and respected monk ordained in accordance with the Druk-lu, having the nine qualities of a spiritual master, and being accomplished in ked-dzog (spiritual development and completion), to the King of Bhutan. The King then appoints that monk to the office of Je Khenpo. In turn, the Lopons are appointed on the same criteria by the Je Khenpo on the advice of the remaining members of the Dratshang Lhentshog. The sitting Je Khenpo is the formal leader of the southern branch of the Drukpa Kagyu sect, which is part of the Kagyu tradition of Himalayan Buddhism. The primary duty of the Je Khenpo is to lead the Dratshang Lhentshog and to arbitrate on matters of doctrine, assisted by the Five Lopons. The Je Khenpo is also responsible for many important liturgical and religious duties across the country. Aside from the King of Bhutan, only the Je Khenpo may don a saffron kabney.

It was designed by Dr. Donald Macnab and Shawn Bakker. The questionnaire is designed to identify personality traits that relate to work performance; it usually takes between 15 and 20 minutes to complete. It was created for the applications of selecting job candidates, guiding career choices and improving team functionality. The Work Personality Index assesses 17 primary scales that measure aspects of work personality to make links between an individual‚Äôs preferences and their work behavior. These 17 scales are categorized into five groups that provide a view of work personality. The Work Personality Index measures personality traits immediately applicable to work settings. The test items revolve around typical work experiences, and for people to respond to them correctly they need to be able to relate to the situations presented in each item. For this reason, the Work Personality Index is appropriate for people in the working population. Younger adults may not have enough work experience to respond to the items in a valid way. Therefore, it is recommended that the Work Personality Index be used with people who are older than seventeen years of age. The Work Personality Index measures personality traits for the normal adult population and does not examine clinical or mental health related issues. As a result, low scores on the scales are not indicative of pathology, but rather, different preferences and motivations for working. These different preferences and motivations influence the type of work people are successful at and what they enjoy doing. Conceptualization The Work Personality Index model is built upon the personality traits identified in the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) developed by the U.S. Department of Labor. This model is not based upon a theoretical view of human personality, but is a combination and ordering of personality traits that predict job performance. The model was formulated by examining two main sources. First, many research studies have been conducted that link different personality traits to effective job performance. Commonly known as predictive or concurrent validity studies, this research provides important evidence of the traits that can be measured effectively and that predict job performance. Examining these studies lead to the identification of a number of personality traits that consistently relate to effectiveness on the job. Second, existing taxonomies that are used in personal development and personnel selection were reviewed. To examine these taxonomies, the personality measures that operationalize them were analyzed, and their research critiqued. These personality measures included: the California Psychological Inventory, by Harrison Gough, the Hogan Personality Inventory, by R. Hogan and J. Hogan, and the NEO PI-R, by Paul Costa and Robert McCrae. Reviewing these personality assessments led to the identification of other personality traits that are closely tied to work preferences and motivations. By examining these two main sources, 17 primary scales were identified, which the O*NET researchers grouped into 7 global scales. However, factor analysis of the trial Work Personality Index data indicated that a 5 factor solution provided a better fit. Therefore, the Work Personality Index contains 17 primary scales that are categorized into 5 global constructs. The 5 groups are labeled Achievement Orientation, Conscientiousness, Social Orientation, Practical Intelligence and Adjustment. These groups closely mirror the global traits identified in the Five-Factor Model of Personality Big Five personality traits. The 17 primary scales represent a finer grained assessment of the 5 constructs. For example, Achievement Orientation contains the following primary scales: Ambition, Initiative, Flexibility, Energy, and Leadership. Constructs and traits * Achievement Orientation - Achievement Orientation involves working hard and wanting to get ahead, persisting in the face of obstacles, and striving for career success. *:Primary scales: Ambition, Initiative, Flexibility, Energy and Leadership. * Conscientiousness - Conscientiousness involves being planful, careful, dependable and disciplined. *:Primary scales: Persistence, Attention to Detail, Rule-Following and Dependability. * Social Orientation - Social Orientation is represented by sensitivity to the needs of others, a willingness to work cooperatively rather than independently, and a preference for working with others and establishing personal relationships. *:Primary scales: Teamwork, Concern for Others, Outgoing and Democratic. * Practical Intelligence - Practical Intelligence involves characteristics such as insight, imagination, originality, being open to new ideas and maintaining a thoughtful approach to work. *:Primary scales; Innovation and Analytical Thinking. * Adjustment - The Adjustment composite found in the Work Personality Index closely resembles the Neuroticism composite found in the Five-Factor Model. Representing the tendency to remain calm, composed and free from worry in stressful situations, other common labels for this construct include Emotional Stability, Negative Emotionality and Worrying. *:Primary scales: Self-Control and Stress Tolerance. Norming The Work Personality Index was standardized on a large sample of over 8000 people. From this group a matched sample of 3000 males and 3000 females were selected to create North American norms. The large number of participants involved in the norm sample ensures that the Work Personality Index results effectively measure and identify differences in personality traits.

After the reunification of Germany, in 1990 Artern was assigned to the state of Th√ºringen, which had once again been founded, and through the districting reforms of the reunified Germany was included in Kyffh√§userkreis and in S√∂mmerda (district). Geography Artern, which lay in the Kyffh√§user, is traversed by the Helme and Unstrut. The largest settled areas near the district capital Artern were the cities Bad Frankenhausen, Heldrungen, and Wiehe and the parish of Ro√üleben. Other neighboring settled areas included the parishes of Bilzingsleben, Borxleben, Bottendorf, Bretleben, Donndorf, Esperstedt. Gehofen, Gorsleben, Hauteroda, Heygendorf, Ichstedt, Kalbsrieth, Kannawurf, Nausitz, Oberheldrungen, Reinsdorf, Ringleben Sch√∂newerda, and Voigtstedt.

ZEXAL, is a Japanese manga and anime series and the third spin-off of the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise, after the preceding Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's. The manga began serialization in Shueisha's V Jump magazine from December 2010 to June 2015 and is licensed in North America by Viz Media. The anime series was produced by Nihon Ad Systems and TV Tokyo, and its animation was done by Gallop. It aired on TV Tokyo from April 2011 to September 2012, with an English-language version airing in North America between October 2011 and August 2013. A second series, titled , aired in Japan From October 2012 to March 2014 and in North America from June 2013 to January 2016. The series was succeeded by Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V. The series aired on The CW's Saturday morning cartoon block, Toonzai, and continued to air on its successor, Vortexx. The series was later broadcast on Nicktoons starting April 12, 2013. After Vortexx ended, new episodes were streamed to Hulu beginning July 14, 2014. In Canada, the series aired on YTV starting June 2, 2012, while new episodes of Zexal II moved to Teletoon on May 4, 2014. Plot and setting Taking place in the near future in a place called Heartland City, the story focuses on Yuma Tsukumo, a young duelist who strives to become the Duel Monsters champion, despite being an amateur. One day, during a duel with a rival named Shark, a mysterious spirit called Astral appears before him, and helps him to win. Astral explains to Yuma he is searching for his lost memories, which have been transformed into 99 cards called , which have been scattered across the globe. The Numbers have the ability to possess the duelists who own them, and bring out their darkest desires. In order to recover his memories, Astral teams up with Yuma in order to recover the Number cards. After coming up against a boy named Kite Tenjo, who is hunting after Numbers, Yuma and Astral gain the ability to combine their forces using the power of . Entering the World Duel Carnival tournament, Yuma finds himself up against various rivals, including the vengeance-seeking Vetrix and the maniacal Dr. Faker, who seek the Numbers for their own gain. Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal II takes place right after the end of the first series. In this new story, as the curtain falls on the World Duel Carnival, peace has finally returned to Heartland City. But now, forces from Barian World, a world hostile to Astral's World, are aiming at taking the \\"Numbers\\" and Astral for themselves. In order to protect Astral, Yuma, Kite, and Shark stand together to combat the Barian threat. Themes Similar to how the original series utilized elements of Egyptian mythology, Zexal loosely used bits of Christian and Greek Mythology for its motif. Examples include Yuma and Astral's signature card, Number 39: Hope (Number 39: Utopia in the English Dub), representing a role akin to a Guardian Angel, the Seven Barian Warlords (final antagonists of Zexal II) are very much based on the named stars of the Big Dipper, and the inspiration for Heartland City (the setting) and World Duel Carnival being Carnivals; which are festivities that coincidentally originate from Christian and Greek cultures. Just like all other Yu-Gi-Oh! series, Zexal also places a major emphasis on bonds and friendship. The gameplay gimmick introduced in Zexal is AR Duels (Alternate Reality Duels), in which both players utilize a high-tech monocle known as a Duel Gazer to observe a virtual reality where the Duel Monsters interact with the environment, as if they exist in a parallel world of their own.

It draws its members ‚Äì junior and senior scholars, graduate students, and government experts ‚Äì primarily from North America, Romania, the Republic of Moldova and Western Europe. Through its activities, the SRS wishes to facilitate academic exchange within and across a multitude of disciplines, including history, sociology, geography, anthropology and ethnography, political science, philosophy, law and justice studies, literature and linguistics, economics and business, international affairs, religious, gender, film and media studies, art history, music and education. The society understands Romanian studies broadly to encompass political, socioeconomic and cultural developments in Romania and the Republic of Moldova, the situation of their ethnic minorities and their relations with the ethnic majority, as well as the position of Romanians and Moldovans living outside those countries.  Activities  The society holds its Annual General Meeting at the annual conference of the Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies (ASEEES), organized in late November in the United States. At that time, the Society also offers an annual graduate student essay prize for an outstanding unpublished essay or thesis chapter written in English by a graduate student and a biennial bok award to the best single-authored scholarly title published in English in any social science or humanities discipline on a Romanian studies topic. SRS members also attend conferences organized by different universities and other scholarly associations. Since 1986, the society has held seven well-attended international congresses gathering Romanian studies scholars from a variety of countries. The First International Congress was held at the Sorbonne in Paris in 1986 with the help of Asociatia Internationala de Studii Romanesti. It was decided to organize these international meetings in Romania. Subsequent congresses were then held in Ia»ôi in 1993, Cluj in 1997, Suceava in 2001, Constan»õa in 2007 and Sibiu in 2012. The seventh congress was held in Bucharest on June 17‚Äì19, 2015, hosted by the Faculty of Political Science at the University of Bucharest. In 2013, the society launched a book collection in partnership with Polirom, Romania‚Äôs largest publisher of academic titles. Co-ordinated by Irina Livezeanu and Lavinia Stan, the Studii Rom√¢ne≈üti/Romanian Studies/√âtudes Roumaines/Rum√§nische Studien series publishes scholarly books in Romanian written or edited by SRS members. It considers for publication Romanian translations of scholarly monographs already published in a foreign language, original scholarly monographs written in Romanian, and edited collections of Romanian-language essays dealing with a unifying theme. Book proposals must deal with Romania and/or Moldova and the populations living on their territories or with the Romanian and Moldovan diasporas and cultures, and they must have primarily an academic profile. Contributions may have a disciplinary, interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary focus, drawing on history, political science, sociology, anthropology, law, economics, linguistics, literature, art history and other fields. The American Historical Association and the American Political Science Association are some of the scholarly organizations with which the SRS is affiliated. The society has joint-membership arrangements with the South East European Studies Association (SEESA), as well as the Romanian Studies Association of America (RSAA). Recently, the society has welcomed the Faculty of Political Science at the University of Bucharest, the Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies, and CEPOS at the University of Craiova among its organizational members.

Also it was the second-coldest December in the narrower Central England Temperature (CET) record series which began in 1659, falling 0.1 ¬∞C short of the all-time record set in 1890.http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcet/mly_cet_mean_sort.txt Although data has never officially been compiled, December 2010 is thought to be colder than December 1890 over the United Kingdom as a whole, as Scotland was up to 2 ¬∞C warmer than England. Hence, it is thought to be the coldest December across the UK as a whole since before 1659.https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/IO_9a153117-9b8b-4ec8-a415-d478ce001f49/ The winter of 2010 in England saw the earliest widespread winter snowfall since 1993 with snow falling as early as 24 November across Northumberland and North Yorkshire. A maximum snow depth of was recorded on 1 December in the Peak District, Sheffield, Doncaster, the Cotswold Hills and the Forest of Dean. In this event Scotland and Northern England were most severely affected. On 9 December temperatures recovered across much of the UK, causing a partial thaw. Later, on Thursday 16 December a cold front reintroduced a cold, arctic airstream. This cold spell brought further snow and ice chaos back to Ireland and Britain with Southern England, Wales, the Republic of Ireland (excluding the westerly coastal regions) and Northern Ireland bearing the brunt of the wintry conditions. This led to severe disruption to the road and rail network with several airports being closed including London Heathrow Airport for a time. Several local temperature records were broken including a new record low for Northern Ireland of -18.7 ¬∞C recorded at Castlederg on 23 December 2010. By the new year a thaw had begun, and there was no recurrence of the extreme conditions for the remainder of the winter. There was some snowfall in early January, and there was an anticyclonic spell at the end of the month that brought some cold, frosty days. February was above average in temperature and ended on a mild note, although the snow returned in much of Scotland during March. Background During the latter part of November, northern blocking established over Greenland which resulted in the Jet Stream moving south, allowing cold air to flow in from the east. Forecasters warned of the potential for severe winter weather from weeks in advance and the Government stated that they were prepared for winter weather after the previous British winter of 2009‚Äì2010 caused havoc and widespread disruption. The cold weather arrived in Britain and Ireland on 22 November and by 24 November, snow showers brought by a stiff northerly wind fell over the North East of England and Northern and Eastern Scotland which resulted in 10‚Äì20 cm locally and gridlock in many of the major roads within Aberdeen during the evening rush hour of 24 November. In the following days, the snowfall became far more widespread leading to widespread travel disruption, school closures and cancellation of sporting fixtures. The Met Office confirmed that it was the most widespread snowfall in the United Kingdom for 17 years. By 2 December, most of the United Kingdom and much of Ireland was covered with snow, accumulations in the north and east of Scotland and England were over 50 cm in places, with over one metre of snow lying on much of the Scottish mountains. Snow depths elsewhere were between 5 cm‚Äì30 cm widely. Temperatures fell widely below ‚àí10 ¬∞C with some areas staying sub-zero by day. On 2 December there was particularly low temperatures in major towns and cities, particularly in Scotland where it dropped to ‚àí18 ¬∞C in Aberdeen and on 3 December temperatures in England broke records. However, the lowest temperature of the winter of ‚àí21.2 ¬∞C was recorded at Altnaharra, Sutherland at 10 am on 2 December and Braemar and Kinbrace both dropped to ‚àí20 ¬∞C on the night of 2 December.

Economy The severe cold spell came in the run up to Christmas and was estimated to cost the British economy up to ¬£1.2 billion a day with a total cost of ¬£13 billion. Retailers were particularly badly hit by lost sales with footfall down nearly 20% compared to the same period the previous year and as much as 30% in the West Midlands and South East. Some experts suggested that it may have a knock on effect in delaying or reversing economic growth.

This caused the airport to be temporarily closed. No passengers were injured. Gatwick Airport and Edinburgh Airport were closed all day on 1 December due to heavy snow. Other effects 7,000 schools in the UK were closed on 2 December. Timeline November 2010 In late November, a snow storm had moved from southern Sweden, reaching Northumberland and the Scottish Borders Region during 23 November. The Met Office issued a number of weather warnings, and snow began to fall in the early evening of 24 November, with 2 inches recorded in Newcastle upon Tyne. Snow in Northumberland on 25 November By 26 November, nighttime temperatures fell well below 0 ¬∞C, with the Welsh towns of Sennybridge and Trawscoed being among the coldest places at ‚Äì10.2 ¬∞C. The cold snap heralded the earliest winter snow fall for 17 years. The AA dealt with an estimated 15,500 calls regarding breakdowns on the same day. The night of the 26/27 November saw a thunder storm damage electrical systems and flood roads, causing disruption transport services on 27 November, including to trains in Dublin. Elsewhere in Ireland, the Irish Insurance Federation revealed there were 22,450 claims from the public, the majority of which involved snow or ice damage to people's homes. The DART and the northern commuter and Maynooth commuter lines were not running and Belfast and Rosslare train services out of Dublin were also affected. The main runway at Dublin Airport due to snow and ice for most of the day. Later in November, the Met Office's warnings remained in place across much of the UK, with Scotland and North East England predicted to have the heaviest snowfalls, with new warnings in place for icy roads in Northern Ireland and Wales. Snow was causing problems on some roads, with gritters deployed as temperatures dipped to -3 ¬∞C (27 ¬∞F). The AA reportedly faced a 40% increase in call-outs, compared to an average November. Motorists in Wales and Northern Ireland struggled with icy roads while Scotland was facing more heavy snow and drifts thanks to a biting wind. The CET (Central England Temperature) was -4.0 ¬∞C on 28 November, the lowest November CET mean since -4.6 ¬∞C was recorded on 24 November 1904. The lowest temperature of the month was also recorded on this day, with -17.5 ¬∞C recorded at Llysdinam, Wales. The Met Office at RAF Linton-on-Ouse in North Yorkshire recorded a record low for November of -11.2 ¬∞C; earlier that month on the 4th it had recorded a record maximum for November of 17.6 ¬∞C. December 2010 According to the Manley Central England Temperature record (beginning in 1659), the second-coldest December ever recorded in central England. Also the coldest December in the UK since UK records began in 1890, and the coldest December in Ireland since official records began. Photograph of snow in Ireland taken by the NASA Aqua satellite on 2 December 2010 In early December, a minimum of -21.1 ¬∞C was recorded at Altnaharra, Scottish Highlands. A band of snow moving north affected Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, South and West Yorkshire, giving significant accumulations here, with further frequent heavy snow showers to North East England and Eastern Scotland. Up to 40 cm of snow was recorded in Rotherham and Sheffield, 20 cm of fresh snow in Mansfield (bringing total depths to over 30 cm), 20 to 30 cm in Leeds, 30 cm in Pontefract and up to 40 cm in parts of Lincolnshire. Very heavy snow that had fallen in Sheffield on 1 December 2010 On 3 December, an all-time record low of -17.9 ¬∞C recorded at RAF Leeming (since records began at Leeming in 1945) and -19.0 ¬∞C at RAF Topcliffe in North Yorkshire. By 6 December, snowfall in the Central Belt in Scotland led to the closure of the M8 motorway for two days with hundreds of motorists stranded overnight. The resulting political furore led to the resignation of Scottish Minister for Transport, Stewart Stevenson. By mid-December, a cold front reached the Shetland Isles and moved southwards across Scotland. Mild air preceded the front, with cold air straight from the Arctic following it, resulting in some rapid temperature drops throughout Scotland and its Isles. An unofficial temperature of 11.6 ¬∞C, the highest of the month so far, was recorded near Lairg, Scottish Highlands at around 7pm in the milder air. The cold front continued to move southwards across the UK passing Northern Ireland and Northern England. A blizzard on 18 December 2010, at Leamington Spa, Warwickshire. The ungritted roads in the town centre in Banbury, Oxfordshire, on 18 December 2010. Later in December, the M5 became gridlocked, and shops in the Birmingham area closed early on the last Saturday before Christmas. A number of passengers travelling by coach had to spend the night at Birmingham Coach Station due to not only coaches for onwards destinations being unable to depart and arrive Birmingham, but also widespread disruption to train services making onwards alternatives impossible. Airports including Heathrow Airport closed some its runways for a time, with Gatwick also cancelling a number of flights. The Oxford Canal in Banbury, frozen solid on 19 December 2010. A minimum temperature of -19.6 ¬∞C was recorded in Shawbury, Shropshire. And a minimum temperature of -17.6 ¬∞C was recorded at Castlederg, a new record for Northern Ireland and -19.6 ¬∞C was recorded at Chesham, Buckinghamshire. Heavy snow fall was also reported over large parts of Devon causing major travel disruption. Dublin Airport and City of Derry Airport were forced to fully close, 15 cm (6 inches) of snow was recorded at Dublin Airport. Only three days after breaking the record minimum for Northern Ireland, Castlederg broke the record again with a low of -18.7 ¬∞C. On 24 December, it was decided to cancel the 27th IRFU's Celtic League meeting with Leinster as Ulster's Ravenhill pitch froze under heavy snow. Both northern and southern Ireland were under heavy snow. 25 December 2010 was also the coldest Christmas Day since 1830, with a CET of -5.9 ¬∞C. The Republic of Ireland's lowest-ever December temperature on record was also recorded on Christmas Day, at -17.5 ¬∞C at Straide, County Mayo. At the end of December, thousands of homes and businesses in Northern Ireland and Wales were without water as melting snow and ice revealed many burst pipes. Northern Ireland Water said it was alternating supplies from reservoirs in order to help alleviate the crisis in which some properties had been without supplies since before Christmas. January 2011 January again was colder than average across the UK, though much milder than December, with a mean temperature across the UK of 3.1 ¬∞C. In contrast to December, it was dry across most of the country (except South East England which was wetter than average). It had more frost than average across most of the UK. However, freezing rain caused disruption in Shropshire, and Greater Manchester experienced heavy overnight snow which affected travel on the morning of the 4th. and snow fell in the West Midlands and parts of Wales, Cheshire and Lancashire on 7 January. Welsh flood warnings stay in place in four areas, with roads closed after heavy bursts of rain affecting Conwy and Gwynedd. By 15.55 GMT, there were four flood warnings and six flood alerts 16 January 2011. February 2011 February was a mild month (the 9th mildest in the last century) with very little frost and much of the country having its first snow-free February since 1998. The only significant wintry weather came on the 18th-21st when some overnight dustings of snow fell as far south as the Midlands. March 2011 Heavy snow once again started to cover parts of Scotland, affecting travel from 9 March, with fresh snowfalls bringing more travel disruption on 12 March. Persistent snow affected much of the Highlands of Scotland during the 12th-13th of the month, with reports of 40 cm of lying snow near Fort William and 60 cm of lying snow to the north of Aviemore, with severe drifting. Weather statistics and records In Ireland it was the coldest month since records began and in the UK it was the coldest December since Met Office records began in 1910, with a mean temperature of -1 ¬∞C. It broke the previous record of 0.1 ¬∞C in December 1981. December 2010 has the lowest CET, -0.7 ¬∞C, since a CET of -1.1 ¬∞C was recorded for February 1986. December 2010 can also be confirmed to be the coldest December for 120 years, since a monthly CET of -0.8 ¬∞C was recorded for December 1890 and the second-coldest December since records began in 1659. Probably the most notable record of the winter is the new all-time record low for Northern Ireland, of -18.7 ¬∞C recorded on 23 December at Castlederg, County Tyrone.

Located in the historic St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery in the East Village of Manhattan, it produced the work of new American playwrights, including Lanford Wilson, Murray Mednick, Leonard Melfi, Walter Hadler, and Sam Shepard. Theatre Genesis is often credited as one of the original off-off-Broadway theaters, along with Joe Cino's Caffe Cino, Ellen Stewart's La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club, and Judson Poets Theatre. The theatre was known for its anarchistic, heterosexual, machismo energy, and often produced political plays. Like the other off-off-Broadway theatres, Theatre Genesis used a non-commercial model of production. Founding the theatre St Mark's Church - New York City Michael Allen at St. Mark's A young, progressive Episcopalian rector named Michael Allen came to St. Mark's in 1963 and opened the parish to everyone from the neighborhood. He did outreach to the many demographics and ethnicities in the East Village, which included artists, counterculturists, immigrants, and homeless people, among others. Allen aimed to fund arts and education initiatives in order to reflect the character of the neighborhood. Unlike Judson Church, in the West Village, the cultural programming at St. Mark's received minimal resistance from the church's older, wealthier, more conservative members. Plays, poetry readings, underground films, and political gatherings began happening regularly at the church. Allen then decided an additional staff member was necessary to coordinate this programming, and hired Ralph Cook. Ralph Cook as curator After temporarily employing the curator Tom Pike, Allen met Ralph Cook, an actor, who came to one of Allen's Sunday services. Cook began coming to the church regularly, and Allen and Cook became friends. Allen hired Cook for the role of curator, as Cook was well- connected in the downtown arts scene and had many friends who were looking for a space to showcase their creative work. His friends included Sam Shepard, Murray Mednick, Leonard Melfi, and Tom Sankey, among others. Their writing reflected the political and social upheaval that they were witnessing, and was often full of angst and testosterone. Their work didn't fit comfortably into the perceived camp aesthetic and looser structure at Caffe Cino and La MaMa. The church housed a 70-seat black box theater with sixteen lights, nine dimmers, spare sets, and minimal props. Much of the work being produced at the theatre had nihilistic themes. Cook said of Theatre Genesis: :Here, now, in lower Manhattan, the phenomenon is taking place: the beginning, the Genesis, of a cultural revolution. It is taking place out of utter necessity. Out of the necessity to survive....Personally I have little hope for the survival of our civilization. But whatever hope we have lies with our artists. For they alone have the ability (if we do not continue to corrupt them) to withstand the onslaught of the mass media and the multitude of false gods. They alone have the ability to show us ourselves.Orzel and Smith, Eight Plays from Off- Off-Broadway. New York: Bobbs-Merrill Company, 1966. Early history of the theatre Sam Shepard As the theatre's newly-hired \\"lay minister of the arts\\", Cook began his routine of reading scripts. He quickly created a diligent and thorough selection process with a two-pronged production track: there was a season of six or fewer new plays, and a Monday night workshop series where playwrights could have their work read. Cook believed in giving new playwrights exposure and continuity, in order to develop the artist in addition to the individual play. Cook never commissioned work or guaranteed that a work would be produced in the future. While this often led Genesis playwrights to produce their work elsewhere, it also developed their trust in Cook to be honest and objective. Sam Shepard at the age of 20, when he was first produced at Theatre Genesis After an early off-key production of Michael Boyd's Study in Color, Cook produced a double-bill of one-acts by Sam Shepard. Cowboys and The Rock Garden were both homages to Samuel Beckett, and reflected Shepard's wanderings with then-comrade Charles Mingus III (son of Charles Mingus). The one-acts harnessed his youthful energy, using playful language, but also represented a raw, innovative voice from the streets. Shepard describes those first productions: > We were in rehearsal for [two plays] within that week... We had no money. I > can remember getting props off the street. We'd take Yuban coffee cans, > punch a hole in them, and use them for lights. We did it all from scratch, > which was pretty incredible.Soloski, Alexis. ‚ÄúTrue East: Sam Shepard Returns > to New York.‚Äù The Village Voice. Retrieved December 15, 2010. Cowboys and The Rock Garden were largely dismissed by critics, who could not see past the similarities to Beckett. However, Michael Smith of The Village Voice wrote in 1964: :I know it sounds pretentious and unprepossessing: 'Theatre Genesis... dedicated to the new playwright'... But they have actually found a new playwright, [and] he has written a pair of provocative and genuinely original plays... Shepard is feeling his way, working with an intuitive approach to language and dramatic structure and moving into an area between ritual and naturalism, where character transcends psychology, fantasy breaks down literalism, and the patterns of ordinariness have their own lives. His is a gestalt theater which evokes the existence behind behavior. Smith's review bolstered attendance, allowing the public to notice Shepard and introducing other new playwrights to the theatre. Off-off-Broadway, off- Broadway, and Broadway Although Shepard's work was produced in other off- off-Broadway theaters, he considered Theatre Genesis his true beginning. In 1965, his one-act Chicago was produced alongside Lawrence Ferlinghetti's The Customs Inspector in Baggy Pants. The production was transferred to another theatre due to its success, which caused problems for shows like Chicago for multiple reasons. First, Theatre Genesis plays were often written in response to the increasingly consumerist model of off-Broadway theatre. They were written specifically for the gritty, intimate environment of Theatre Genesis. Uptown, the plays lost their context and were less successful. Sally Banes has argued that, \\"For off-off-Broadway, graduating to off-Broadway - leaving the alternative home and the alternative community - was a fate to be avoided, for it altered the relations of production, turning the artists into alienated labor.\\"Banes, Sally. \\"Greenwich Village 1963: Avant-Garde Performance and the Effervescent Body\\". Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1993. Ralph Cook is quoted as saying, \\"We couldn't care less about Broadway. We are aware that it exists somewhere uptown, no more.\\"Davis, Douglas M. \\"The Expanding Arts: Success for Off-Off-Broadway\\". National Observer, April 10, 1967. There were also more practical concerns about transferring shows uptown. Due to union restrictions in off-Broadway theatres, a transfer meant that most of the non- union cast had to be replaced. Shepard and his actors were frustrated when Chicago was transferred, as many of his actors had helped to create their roles. Off-off-Broadway's tensions with Actors' Equity Association continued until the showcase code was created. This code allows union actors to perform in experimental, not-for-profit productions in exchange for being compensated for travel expenses to rehearsals. Jack Kroll said of the theatre: :Theatre Genesis is a mix of counterculture ingredients; a coolness that can explode like liquid oxygen, a dropout hipsterism, a polymorphous perversity of language and feeling, a Zap Comix mocking of straight heads.Jack Kroll in Newsweek. Melfi, Koutoukas, and Mednick Lanford Wilson, Jean-Claude van Itallie, H.M. Koutoukas, Rosalyn Drexler, Irene Fornes, Leonard Melfi, Tom Eyen, Paul Foster --many of whom were produced at Theatre Genesis. 1966 Between 1964 and 1966, Cook produced debut productions of many playwrights, including one-acts from a then-unknown Charles L. Mee. Another early production was a version of Medea by H.M. Koutoukas. The production was set in a laundromat, where Medea kills her offspring in the washing machine. Koutoukas was simultaneously having his work produced at Theatre Genesis and Caffe Cino, not having told either theatre about the other theatre's production. The Caffe Cino production had Medea played by a man (Charles Stanley) in drag. When Koutoukas submitted the script to Genesis, the role was played by a woman (Linda Eskenas), which he intended as a prank. Although the production was successful, Cook was angry at Koutoukas. Theatre Genesis' production of Koutoukas' Medea opened on October 31, 1965, the final weekend of the Caffe Cino run. Many favored the campy Cino production. Paul Foster describes the play's climax: > Medea was there for you to reach out and touch, forming the unspeakable > crime of infanticide in her mind. Then she threw her baby into a laundromat > and washed it to death with Oxydol. She slammed the lid down and set the > dial on HEAVY LOAD. How can you forget things like that?Bottoms, Stephen J. > Playing Underground: A Critical History of the 1960s Off-Off-Broadway > Movement. 2004. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2007. A third production, with the Caffe Cino cast, ran at La MaMa on October 13, 1965. The three productions of Koutoukas' Medea, at Caffe Cino, La MaMa, and Theatre Genesis, furthered the divide between the campiness of the first two theaters and the more masculine persona of Theatre Genesis. Linda Eskenas and Anthony Sciabona in \\"Medea\\" by Harry M. Koutoukas, Theatre Genesis. Photo by James D. Gossage. Leonard Melfi would become Theatre Genesis' most-produced playwright. In 1965, Melfi had five of his one-acts produced by Cook. He received the most success for his short play Birdbath. The play was written specifically for Cook, who would later direct the production, and was originally titled Coffeecake and Caviar. Birdbath's plot centers around Frankie, who has a one-night stand with a waitress named Velma. They drink and talk into the night, going further into their hidden pasts, until Velma reveals that she murdered her mother earlier that morning. Birdbath remained a staple of off-off-Broadway, receiving a production at La MaMa and later being published by Ellen Stewart in Six From La Mama. Joe Chaikin paints Joyce Aaron in San Shepard's \\"Fourteen Hundred Thousand\\" at Theatre Genesis cir. 1967 Perhaps the most experimental and enigmatic of the Theatre Genesis playwrights was Murray Mednick. Mednick, who later co-ran Theatre Genesis after Cook's departure, often workshopped his scripts repeatedly with Genesis actors before finalizing the text. His plays The Hunter, Willie the Germ, and The Hawk were ritualistic interpretations of life on the streets. For The Hawk, Mednick developed the script through improvisation with a group of actors over two months. An exploration of drug addiction, The Hawk employed the ritual elements and poetic language emblematic of Theatre Genesis. The free-form style of the play began to appear with greater frequency at theaters like The Living Theater and Joseph Chaikin's The Open Theater, and was a departure from the scripted plays previously produced at Theatre Genesis. Smith, of The Village Voice, wrote: > The Hawk is convincingly detailed, yet mysterious... sharply contemporary, > the form strange but not obstructive; it is performed with exceptional > immediacy and authority; its ultimate intent remains veiled or vague, but > the other levels are so rich it doesn't matter.... in moving beyond the > documentary realism of the world of heroin addiction, The Hawk and Theatre > Genesis had gone a step beyond gritty poetic realism, and for that reason, > it was perhaps the most daring venture yet attempted by Genesis and perhaps > its single most important achievement.Crespy, David A. Off-Off-Broadway > Explosion: How Provocative Playwrights of the 1960s Ignited a New American > Theater. New York: Back Stage Books, 2003. Mednick describes his use of poetic language in the play: :There was a kind of presentational quality to the language which I think we were very influenced by. We had a similar attitude toward language, which has to do with a feeling about the spoken word as an almost shamanistic act, incantatory, ritualistic, as opposed to the theatrical dialogue tradition... We had a very high estimation of the idea of the word itself coming through the medium of the actor. Masculinity and heterosexism of Theatre Genesis Ben Masters and Bill Moor in Mar√≠a Irene Forn√©s' ‚ÄúTango Palace‚Äù at Theatre Genesis. 1973. Most of the work produced at Theatre Genesis incorporated testosterone and drugs, and the close-knit community of artists created a perceived machismo persona for the theater. Tony Barsha, a playwright who has said that the heterosexual environment of Theatre Genesis made it the only off-off-Broadway theatre where he felt comfortable, is quoted saying that the theatre consisted of \\"a bunch of guys, and their babes, and their drugs\\". However, many women did work at the Genesis in later years, including Mar√≠a Irene Forn√©s. She said of the theatre: :[Theatre Genesis] was not macho in the usual way, but something very kind of defeated... Not 'macho macho', but 'macho drug', which is different. These were straight men but from the street drug world. Macho drug has this kind of undercurrent of anger, disappointment, possible violence. By 1967, the divide between the homosexual environment of Caffe Cino and the heterosexual Theatre Genesis began to dissolve. More work was focused on social and political issues, particularly America's involvement in Vietnam and civil and gay rights. One Genesis production involving social and political commentary was Grant Duay's Fruit Salad (1967). The play juxtaposed film footage of a woman making fruit salad with scenes of soldiers engaged in war. Each soldier had a name like Banana, Melon, or Cherry, and the seriousness of their situation was intended to be juxtaposed against the trivial nature of the fruit salad. The character Cherry is clearly intended to be a homosexual. Throughout the play, Banana makes homophobic comments to Cherry, then eventually reveals to his own homosexuality in a sexual interaction between the two men. Although the play includes homosexual themes, a departure for Theatre Genesis, many critics have noted that the overall aesthetic of the piece was consistent with the earlier work produced at the theater. Barsha directed the production, and Smith of The Village Voice wrote that it was \\"vivid, simple and arresting... A bitter, painful, almost despairing vision presented with lightness, fluidity, conciseness and cunning\\". Later history of the theatre Theatre Genesis eventually moved closer to the mainstream. Many off-off-Broadway theaters began being scrutinized by those looking to make a profit and by external funding organizations. In 1966, St. Mark's accepted a $185,000 federal grant brokered by The New School to support the church's art and educational outreach programs, giving each production a budget of $200. Artists were then paid for the work, which was new for off- off-Broadway. The grant eventually led to a troubled relation between Theatre Genesis and external funding. Later in 1966, Cook and Allen refused a large Ford Foundation, and later stopped accepting the New School funding deal due to \\"excessive entanglement with the government\\". Cook then had to solicit funding from the Ford Foundation, and the theatre eventually became reliant on this external funding. When that funding was reduced in 1969, the theatre had to cut the season from six shows to three. Cook left the theater in 1969, leaving it to be co-run by Murray Mednick and Walter Hadler. They operated it as a cooperative for a few more years. David Crespy wrote, \\"The [East] Village was morphing around them as well... Jazz was being replaced by psychedelic rock, and the long-haired counterculture of 1969 was bringing a less angst- driven energy\\". Downtown activism was still prevalent, but Joe Cino's death on April 2, 1967 marked a departure from the origins of off-off-Broadway.

She was sister of the writer, journalist and occasional diplomat, Ramiro de Maeztu and the painter Gustavo de Maeztu. Mar√≠a de Maeztu. Early life Mar√≠a was the fourth of five children born in Vitoria the capital of the Basque province of √Ålava. Her father, Manuel de Maeztu Rodriguez was a Cuban engineer and landowner from Navarre who had met her mother, Joan Whitney, the daughter of a British diplomat in Paris, when she was sixteen. Maria's parents never married. In 1889 the unexpected death of her father in Cuba led to confusing administrative problems and the family was left in ruins. Her mother, a fragile but enterprising woman with a strong personality, took her three sons and two daughters to Bilbao and, in 1891, set up a residential school for girls to study French and English and improve their cultural skills. Mar√≠a started teaching at her mother's Anglo-French academy and then began to teach in the public schools of Bilbao. In 1903 she accepted the Ayuntamiento of Bilbao's post as director of the newly established night school for adults and also served as director of kindergarten (1902‚Äì1912). She created summer school colonies and focused on secular education which garnered her many enemies. Her fame became so widespread that, despite her youth, she was invited to share the stage with Concepci√≥n S√°iz, Miguel de Unamuno and other academicians at the Exposici√≥n escolar de Bilbao (Exhibition of Scholars) in 1905. Mar√≠a was an eloquent speaker and her knowledge of languages placed her in a position to represent Spain at international congresses and to import examples of Anglo- Saxon feminist associations. Without interrupting her work in Bilbao she studied Philosophy and Literature at the University of Salamanca as an unofficial student of Miguel de Unamuno. In the summer of 1908 the Board for Advanced Studies sent her as a delegate to observe the Education Section of the Franco-British Exhibition in London. Later she went on a lecture tour of the United States, Great Britain, Argentina, Cuba and other Spanish cities including University of Salamanca, where she became a disciple of Miguel de Unamuno, and the Complutense University of Madrid where she met Ortega y Gasset. Residencia de Se√±oritas Mar√≠a de Maeztu, from a 1919 publication. In 1915 Mar√≠a backed by the Junta para Ampliaci√≥n de Estudios (Board for Advanced Studies) founded the Residencia de Se√±oritas in Madrid. Governed by the same rules as the Residencia de Estudiantes that had opened in 1910 for men, it became the first official center in Spain whose main objective was to encourage women's participation in advanced education, by providing accommodation for female students. She was its first director and with lectures, poetry readings, musical and theatrical recitals she attracted such intellectuals as Ortega y Gasset, Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez, Victoria Ocampo, etc. as guest speakers. There Unamuno read his play Raquel encadenada (Rachel Enchained) and on 16 March 1932 Federico Garc√≠a Lorca read Poet in New York, his new collection of poetry not published until 1940. Lorca found the atmosphere pleasing and later held the rehearsals for his direction of Blasco Ib√°√±ez's La Barraca at their auditorium. Other supporters and guest lecturers included, Rafael Alberti, Luis Jimenez de Asua, Gregorio Mara√±on, and Ram√≥n del Valle-Incl√°n. Lyceum Club In April 1926, during the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, she founded the Lyceum Club the first woman's club in Spain. Together with assistance from Carmen Baroja and Concha M√©ndez they modelled it after the Lyceum Club's that were in existence in Brussels, London, Milan, New York City, Paris and The Hague. It was intended as a meeting place where women could exchange ideas and defend their social and moral equality as well as material interests. It opened with one hundred and fifty members who represented a well-educated group of professional women, including married women who wanted a broader horizon beyond the four walls of their home. With departments devoted to social issues, literature, the arts and music, science, as well as international affairs, the group sponsored lectures, concerts, exhibitions, and a variety of literary tributes. They advocated for reformation of women's legal status and the creation of day-care centers for working women. Members included Ernestina de Champourc√≠n, Elena Fort√∫n, Mar√≠a Goyri, Mar√≠a Lej√°rraga, Mar√≠a Teresa Le√≥n, Carmen Monne Baroja, Margarita Nelkin and Mabel P√©rez de Ayala. Isabel Oyarz√°bal and Victoria Kent were vice- presidents and the secretary was Zenobia Camprub√≠. Princess Victoria Eugenie and Mar√≠a del Rosario de Silva, Duchess of Alba held the honorary presidency. The Lyceum proved to be very popular and by 1929 its membership had increased to 450, prompting the establishment of a branch in Barcelona in 1931.Sarah Leggott, The Workings of Memory: Life-writing by Women in Early Twentieth- Century Spain, (2008), p.39 Conservative opposition flared up with religious groups and publications condemning the club on its liberal political ideas, its library and what they regarded as its threat to marriage, family, and the Church.Janet P√©rez & Maureen Ihrie, The Feminist Encyclopedia of Spanist Literature, 2002, p.364 One priest declared that, \\"Society should lock them up as mad or criminals instead of allowing them to speak up in this club against all human and divine rules. The moral atmosphere in both the streets and homes would benefit from the hospitalization and imprisonment of these eccentric and unbalanced women.\\"Lesley K. Twomey, Women in Contemporary Culture: Roles and Identities in France and Spain, (2000), p.112 Spanish Civil War & Exile With the start of the Spanish Civil War on 17 July 1936, activities the Lyceum Club and the Residencia de Se√±oritas came to an end. In September Mar√≠a resigned as director of the Residencia and on 29 October 1936, her brother, Ramiro, a right-wing intellectual and member of the Generation of '98, was shot by Republican soldiers near Madrid. Stunned, Mar√≠a left Spain for Buenos Aires where she became professor at the University of Buenos Aires. She returned to Spain just once in 1947 for the funeral of her brother, Gustavo. She died in Mar del Plata on 7 January 1948 and her body was repatriated to the family mausoleum in Estella-Lizarra near Pamplona. During the Civil War the building of the Residencia de Se√±oritas was used as a hospital, nursery and orphanage, and in March 1940 the school re-opened as the Colegio Mayor Teresa de Cepeda under a more conforming administration that was less threatening and suited the mandates of the Church. Throughout Spain, in Alicante, Avil√©s, Barakaldo, Elche, Estella-Lizarra, Estepona, Galapagar, Granada, M√°laga, Puertollano, San Sebasti√°n and Zaragoza, there are streets named in honor of Mar√≠a de Maeztu. In 2006 the Ministry of Development (Ministerio de Formento) in Spain commissioned the Maritime Safety and Rescue Society (Sociedad de Salvamento y Seguridad Mar√≠tima) to build seven tug boats known as the Clase Mar√≠a de Maeztu. In addition to towing vessels and helping boats in trouble, these tugs are used to fight fires at sea, combat marine pollution and salvage shipwrecks.

The third edition was held in 2016 in Zagreb and Rijeka, Croatia. The fourth edition of the EUG was held in 2018 in Coimbra, Portugal. The title of EUSA Cup is awarded to those sport events that are yet to be considered to be put on the list of European Universities Championships. EUSA also grants its patronage to already established university sport events in Europe, helping to promote them through its networks. Educational programme Apart from the sports programme and activities, EUSA also supports and encourages educational activities in the field of student sport. These are mainly realised by the three events organised by EUSA: EUSA Seminars, EUSA Symposiums and EUSA Conventions. EUSA Seminars are organised biannually, and usually accompany the General Assemblies and focus on subjects which are of interest for the member organisations. EUSA Symposiums are also organised biannually, and focus in active inclusion of students and cooperation with the universities. EUSA Conventions are organised annually as a training programme for the organisers of the European Universities Championships and European Universities Games. Other Projects To support the development of University Sport in Europe, EUSA is also implementing or participating in different programs and projects. Since 2005, through its Student Commission, EUSA has implemented a Volunteer Program. It allows student from all over Europe to take part in the different European Universities Championships as volunteers via a network connecting them to the organisers. In 2011, EUSA became partner of an EU-funded project (funded by the European Commission in the preparatory Action in the field of Sport 2011-2012): the European Anti-Doping Initiative. This project has for chief goal to establish a European-wide \\"Anti-Doping Mentality\\" in the youth sector. Emblem, flag and anthem Until 2013 EUSA logo or emblem consistsed of a blue letter \\"U\\" on a white background, with 12 yellow stars surrounding it. Below there was the abbreviation of the organisation - EUSA, in blue letters. The new logo always shows European University Sports Association abbreviation \\"EUSA\\" in blue letters with a yellow star above letter \\"U\\". In a formal version of the logo, below it is the full name of association. The EUSA flag includes the EUSA emblem centred on a flag made out of white material. EUSA adopted the international university anthem Gaudeamus Igitur as its own anthem. Structure Highest governing body of EUSA is the General Assembly which represents the members (currently 45 national university sports associations). The General Assembly elects the Executive Committee (consisting of 13 members) for a period of four years and it takes all the necessary decisions for the smooth running of the organisation. Permanent and ad hoc commissions advise the Executive Committee in their specialised areas (Technical Commission, Medical Commission, Student Commission, Gender Commission, etc.). EUSA is a member of the International University Sports Federation (FISU). The current EUSA president is Mr. Adam Roczek from Poland.

The major town in Dimma is Dimma. Originally part of Gog woreda, at some point between the 1994 national census and the 2001 Sample Agricultural Enumeration, Dimma was split from Gog. At first Dimma, along with Gog and Jor woredas, were part of the Administrative Zone 2; however between 2001 and 2007 the Zone was reorganized and Gog became part of the Anuak Zone.According to Dereje Feyissa this reorganization, which happened in 2003, was done to align territories inside the Gambela Region with the presence of local ethnic groups. (Dereje, \\"The Experience of the Gambela Regional State\\", in Ethnic Federalism: The Ethiopian Experience in Comparative Perspective [Oxford: James Currey, 2006], p. 223) The western part of Sheko from SNNPR was also added to Dimma.

A single example of the R.90 was built, but the type did form the basis of the Romano R.83 and Romano R.92 fighters which were built in secret for the Spanish Republicans during the Spanish Civil War. Design and development Romano R.83 of the Spanish Republican Air Force In 1933, the French Navy issued a specification for a single-seat seaplane fighter capable of being operated from the catapults of its Cruisers and Battleships. To meet this requirement, the Chantiers a√©ronavals √âtienne Romano designed a floatplane, the Romano R.90, with designs also being prepared by Loire, Bernard and Potez.Green and Swanborough 1994, p. 353. Unlike the other three designs, the R.90 was a biplane. It was of mixed construction, with a welded steel-tube fuselage and wooden, single-bay wings,Green and Swanborough 1994, p. 502. with the upper wings being gulled into the top of the fuselage to give a better view for the pilot.Donald 1997, p. 785. Two floats were fitted. The proposed armament was four 7.5mm machine guns, two in the lower wing and two in the floats.Flight 23 January 1936, p. 87.Parmentier, B. \\"Romano R-90\\". Aviafrance. 30 November 2001. Retrieved 18 December 2010. It made its maiden flight in August 1935, powered by a 720 hp (537 kW) Hispano-Suiza 9Vbrs radial engine. With this engine it reached a speed of 352 km/h (219 mph). In October that year it was re-engined with a 680 hp (507 kW) Hispano-Suiza 14Hbrs radial in a NACA cowling, increasing the speed and the floats were modified. It was re-engined again in October 1937 with a 900 hp (671 kW) Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs-1 V12 engine with a 20mm cannon firing through the propeller boss. Despite reaching 400 km/h (248 mph),Green and Swanborough 1994, p. 503. faster than any of the other competitors,Green and Swanborough 1994, pp. 62, 353, 481‚Äì482. the R.90 was not ordered into production, 20 Loire 210s being purchased instead. Although the attempts to sell the R.90 to the French Navy failed, the aircraft attracted the attention of the Spanish Republican Air Force, which placed an order for 24 of a landplane derivative, the Romano R.83. This differed in having a conventional fixed tailwheel undercarriage, a non-gulled upper wing and was to be powered by a 450 hp (336 kW) Pratt & Whitney Wasp Junior engine. These aircraft were to be assembled in secret by the Belgium company LACEBA (Les Ateliers de Construction et d'Exploitation de Brevets A√©ronautiques). Flight testing in Belgium was carried out with a 280 hp (209 kW) Salmson 9ABa engine, to give the impression that the aircraft was a trainer rather than a fighter, with the more powerful engine to be fitted when the aircraft was delivered to Spain. A second landplane fighter derivative was designed and built for the Spanish Republicans, the Romano R.92. This was powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs engine as tested in the Romano R.90, and reverted to the gulled upper wing of the floatplane. A single example was built in 1938. Operational history The first six R.83s were delivered to Barcelona between April and July 1938. The six R.83s were re-engined with the intended Wasp-Junior engines and were probably used as advanced trainers.Nash, David. \\"Aircraft that took part in the Spanish Civil War\\".

Andean Spanish is in red. Andean Spanish is a dialect of Spanish spoken in the central Andes, from western Venezuela, southern Colombia, with influence as far south as northern Chile and Northwestern Argentina, passing through Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. It is influenced principally by Castilian, Canarian and Andalusian Spanish, which is favoured in the cities, but in rural areas and some cities, there is influence of Quechua, Aymara, and other indigenous languages. Phonology * In Andean Spanish, the is never aspirated in the final position and so is pronounced , not , but it is sometimes pronounced apical, rather than laminal, a trait characteristic of Northern Spain. The apical sound is sometimes perceived as transitional between and , and it is associated with a large number of northern Spanish settlers in Andean region. In southern Bolivia and northern Chile, syllable-final /s/ is mostly aspirated. * As in all American dialects of Spanish, Andean Spanish has seseo ( is not distinguished from ). Thus, casa (\\"house\\") and caza (\\"hunt\\") are homophones. However, in Cusco Region, many speakers realize as in some words, particularly in once, doce, trece. Seseo is common to all of America, the Canary Islands, and several areas in southern Spain. * Especially in the Ecuadorian variant, coda is often voiced to before a vowel or before a voiced consonant (including sonorants), but the latter is also a feature of most other Spanish dialects.

Influence on nearby areas In northwest Argentina and northern Chile today, it is possible to say that there is a certain fusion in the dialects of both countries, but the local dialects are more dominant. The Andean dialect can be heard in the northeast, with respect to the pronunciation and lexicon. The Rioplatense dialect provides some of the pronunciation, a variety of modes, and the Argentine dialect. Rioplatense replaces the Andean use of \\"t√∫\\" as the second person singular familiar pronoun with \\"vos\\". It is very similar in Chile, but \\"t√∫\\" and \\"vos\\" are there both used as the singular familiar second-person pronoun. Also, there is influence of Chilean Spanish and some Andean Spanish.

Robinson starred in almost all of the show's sketches, which feature a wide range of original character creations and celebrity impressions. The Morgana Show aired on Channel 4. History Robinson had previously appeared in several comedy shows, including The Green Green Grass and My Family. She also appeared on Channel 4 show The TNT Show in \\"Gilbert's Special Reports\\", as an awkward teenage boy who interviews celebrities, along with a blind soundman and a dwarf camerawoman. The character of Gilbert would later appear in Robinson's own show. The show was commissioned by Channel 4's head of comedy, Shane Allen, who stated \\"Discovering, supporting and nurturing new talent is at the heart of Channel 4 comedy‚Äôs remit, and in Morgana we really feel we‚Äôve found a fresh performer with a huge amount of potential.\\" The show, which ran for one season of five episodes, was initially broadcast from 30 November to 28 December 2010. Selected characters Original characters Gilbert - an awkward teenage boy who is often seen making his own television show, \\"The Gilbert Shows\\", filmed by his grandad. The character first appeared on The TNT Show (see above). Madolynn - an alcoholic, \\"past-her-prime\\" Hollywood star, often seen drinking heavily and making a fool of herself at formal public places, embarrassing her husband, Norman. The news reporters - two reporters who are often seen bickering at each other, making vile remarks about each other - yet they immediately appear to be friends when they begin their live coverage of an event. Before going live, they say \\"Like each other! Like each other!\\" Banker - an arrogant man who is often seen talking loudly on his phone, much to everyone else's annoyance, before receiving his comeuppance at the end of the sketch. The Hicks - a stereotypical redneck family, all of whom possess bizarre phonic tics, triggered by one another. Joyce and Barry - a married couple who run a funeral parlour. They are seen in a documentary about their business. Joyce is often interrupted by Barry and is seemingly exasperated with him. Mimsy - an elderly woman who lives alone in her stately manor. She continues to find everyday objects but names them extraordinary things. The Chelsea Pensioners - two war veterans talk about their experiences in the war, one forgetting something and being corrected (or not) by the other. Monique - daughter of alcoholic Madolynn, who is represented as a parody of a character from the MTV series The Hills. Celebrity impressions Cheryl Cole and Dannii Minogue - both are seen in a make-up room, presumably on the set of The X Factor, and are constantly trying to out-do each other. Cole is often seen winking and simpering to the camera. Fearne Cotton - performs ludicrous stunts, while hyperactive, slapping herself in the face and discussing how annoying she is. Her stunts always go horribly wrong, and she is often left dismembered, impaled or otherwise badly injured, while still looking forward to the next stunt. Lady Gaga - seen performing day-to-day tasks, such as ironing or mowing the lawn, while wearing her outlandish costumes. The sketches are always introduced to the theme of \\"Bad Romance\\". Boris Johnson - shown as a twelve-year-old public schoolboy, bumbling his way through speeches. Reception The show received mixed reviews. The majority, while generally praising Robinson's performance and comic timing, criticised the sketches and writing. The British Comedy Guide wrote that \\"Morgana Robinson is clearly an acting talent to watch, as she demonstrates a very wide range of characters in this show ... however, that all said, this is not going to be the TV vehicle that makes Morgana famous - most of the sketches just simply aren't funny enough.\\" Paul Whitelaw, writing in The Scotsman, said: \\"We must part with our celebration of female-fronted comedy, thanks to The Morgana Show, a witless sketch vehicle for newcomer Morgana Robinson. Why has she got her own show? Is it because her agent is the powerful John Noel, who numbers Russell Brand among his clients? I wonder.\\" John Crace of The Guardian wrote: \\"At her best, Robinson is one of the sharpest and funniest comics around: unfortunately, this show didn't do her any favours.\\" Fiona Sturges of The Independent described the show as \\"teeth-grindingly, bewilderingly awful.\\" However, some critics gave the show a far more positive review. Jane Simon of The Daily Mirror wrote: \\"I know what you're thinking: Morgana who? The funny girl isn't a household name, but we expect that to change after Morgana Robinson's debut tonight ... This may be the first you've heard of Morgana - it won't be the last.\\" Ruth Margolis of The Radio Times wrote: \\"Whether or not she makes you laugh, Morgana Robinson is without question a staggeringly brilliant vocal and facial mimic ... Well done to Channel 4 for not wimping out and stashing Morgana on E4.\\" The first episode received 780,000 viewers: average viewership over the series was under 700,000.

The Archive was instrumental in the recreation of turn-of-the-century medicine, as Dr. Burns worked closely with production and the actors to make the hospital scenes realistic and authentic to the period. Dr. Burns provided immersive tutorials in the world of early-20th-century surgery, complete with hands-on practice.

Skookum Air was created in Alaska in 1993 as a Part 135 air carrier operating a single-engine, piston-powered Cessna 185. Back then, Skookum Air‚Äôs primary mission was to fly fishermen, hunters, and supplies from Anchorage to remote Alaskan towns. Very soon after its founding, the company relocated to Long Beach Airport (LGB) in Long Beach, California, changed its name to Air Rutter International (ARI), and started to grow in the executive aircraft charter industry. In just a few years, ARI built up and managed a fleet of eight Citation 500 series and 650 series jet aircraft. In 1998, ARI moved to John Wayne/Orange County Airport (SNA) in Irvine, California. During this period, ARI grew into a well-respected aircraft management company, operating heavy and midsize jets (including such models as G-II, G-III, and G-IV from Gulfstream, the Challenger 601 from Bombardier, and the Hawker 800/700 from Hawker Beechcraft). As its fleet expanded to include heavy jets, ARI obtained World Wide Operations Specifications and, thus, created a foundation for global expansion. Under new ownership in 2005, ARI returned to Long Beach Airport and expanded significantly to specialize in heavy jet management and international charters. In addition, the company established an FBO and a fuel farm at Long Beach. In the spring of 2010 ARI changed its name to JetFlite International, LLC (JFI), established an operating base on the East Coast at Farmingdale Republic Airport (FRG), and added an aircraft largely dedicated to serving the Russian market. JetFlite International has extended its services to include aircraft sales and acquisitions and has earned recognition from both Wyvern Aviation Safety Intelligence and Aviation Research Group/US (ARG/US).

He helped shape South Dakota law in its formative years, started one of the preeminent law offices in the area in the late 19th and early 20th centuries where numerous future lawyers and judges got their start, founded Western Surety Company and participated in the creation of several other businesses. Joe Kirby was born to Irish immigrants Patrick and Mary Ryan Kirby on October 5, 1863 in Lawler, Iowa.History of Dakota Territory by George Kingsbury, Volume IV(1915), page 556, viewable at SDGENWEB archives He attended the early grades of school locally, but there was no high school available in the area. He and some acquaintances used the local grade school facilities to educate themselves during evenings. After finishing his high school education, he worked on his father's farm, taught district school, and studied law a little in New Hampton, Iowa.Bailey's History of Minnehaha County (1899), page 591 At that time, neither law school nor even college were required in order to practice law; the only requirement was the test, which he took and passed. Kirby quickly established himself as a lawyer. He moved from Chickasaw County, Iowa to Sioux Falls in the Dakota Territory, arriving on June 28, 1886. He worked on farms along the way for a meal and a bed. He was admitted to practice in the Dakota Territory on November 12, 1886.Bailey's History of Minnehaha County (1899), page 591 He hoped to work at the Bailey and Davis law firm but couldn't get in, so he went to work for a farmer near Montrose for the summer. In the fall he joined the firm. Two years later, in 1888, he opened his own firm on the northwest corner at 9th and Phillips in downtown Sioux Falls. The 6'3\\" Kirby had a reputation as a hard working advocate. According to an 1899 historian, \\"there is not a more untiring, indefatigable and persistent (right or wrong) lawyer in the city of Sioux Falls.\\"Bailey's History of Minnehaha County (1899), page 591 His son, Dan, recalled that, \\"he was a studious person.\\"The Argus Leader South Dakota 99 (1989), page 123 With extensive experience handling appeals, he was often brought in by area attorneys to take cases to higher courts. He appeared in front of the state's Supreme Court countless times, and the U.S. Supreme Court at least six times,Kirby v. US (1899), Bartell v. US (1913), Sioux Remedy v. Cope (1914), Baltzer v. US (1918), Carey v. South Dakota (1919) and Brooks v. US (1925) which is something few attorneys experience. In the Baltzer case, Kirby was the first attorney to present arguments to the US Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of the Espionage Act of 1917. The importance of that case in the development of First Amendment legal theory in the United States has only recently been discovered by legal scholars.The Great Dissent, Thomas J. Healy, Copyright 2013, Metropolitan Books, pages 64-6, 73 Kirby provided a sound legal education to many aspiring young men, several of whom became outstanding area lawyers. In the words of his son, Dan, \\"He probably contributed more to the law in South Dakota than anybody else of his time.\\" The firm served as an important stepping stone for many successful individuals. The list of associates during the firm's most active decades includes several judges, Clare Rodarrick who was later the state's attorney general and the president of the Chicago Northwestern Railroad, Charles A. Christopherson who served in Congress (1919-1933) and William Bulow of Beresford who was the state's 12th governor (1927-1931) and a U. S. Senator (1931-1943). Both Christopherson and Bulow worked for Kirby in 1893. Joe Kirby married Ella McMahon on February 4, 1891 in Waucoma, Iowa, her home town. They had five children; Patrick, Joe H., Tom, Dan and Alice. All four sons became lawyers. The family lived in a quartzite block home on the south-east corner of 6th and Duluth, just west of downtown Sioux Falls. Kirby was an entrepreneur who was involved in the creation of numerous businesses, many of which would endure long after his death. He started his own successful law office. He helped found the South Dakota Central Railway which ran between Sioux Falls and Watertown and served as its vice president and attorney. He was a long-time director of the Minnehaha National Bank (now First National Bank in Sioux Falls) starting in 1918 when it was founded. But his most successful commercial creation occurred with the founding of Western Surety Company. In 1900, Kirby founded a surety bond company to provide the court bonds he and other lawyers needed in connection with the practice of law. The only source of those bonds was a handful of companies on the East Coast and they couldn't provide fast service. He learned about the surety business from fellow passengers on a train while back east attending a hearing at the U.S. Supreme Court. Western Surety Company went on to become an important business in the state and a national leader in the area of small fidelity and surety bonds. Joe Kirby died at home on February 8, 1926 at age 62.Certified Copy of Minnehaha County Death Record The records show that he had more cases pending before the state Supreme Court than all the other lawyers in the state combined when he died.The Argus Leader South Dakota 99 (1989), page 121 He was recognized in several South Dakota histories, most recently the 1989 Argus Leader publication South Dakota 99 which profiled \\"99 people who significantly contributed to South Dakota's history.\\" He was inducted into the South Dakota Hall of Fame in 1993.\\"Joe Kirby\\", South Dakota Hall of Fame, accessed December 21, 2010 References Kirby, Joe Kirby, Joe 1926 deaths 1863 births People from Chickasaw County, Iowa ","title":"Joe Kirby"},{"id":"30096605","text":"Intergroups are formed of Members of the European Parliament from any political group and any committee, with a view to holding informal exchanges of views on particular subjects and promoting contact between Members and civil society.

Dimension reduction has long been a primary goal of regression analysis. Given a response variable y and a p-dimensional predictor vector \\\\textbf{x}, regression analysis aims to study the distribution of y\\\\textbf{x}, the conditional distribution of y given \\\\textbf{x}. A dimension reduction is a function R(\\\\textbf{x}) that maps \\\\textbf{x} to a subset of \\\\mathbb{R}^k, k < p, thereby reducing the dimension of \\\\textbf{x}.Cook & Adragni (2009) Sufficient Dimension Reduction and Prediction in Regression In: Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 367(1906): 4385‚Äì4405 For example, R(\\\\textbf{x}) may be one or more linear combinations of \\\\textbf{x}. A dimension reduction R(\\\\textbf{x}) is said to be sufficient if the distribution of y\\\\mid R(\\\\textbf{x}) is the same as that of y\\\\mid\\\\textbf{x}. In other words, no information about the regression is lost in reducing the dimension of \\\\textbf{x} if the reduction is sufficient.  Graphical motivation  In a regression setting, it is often useful to summarize the distribution of y\\\\mid\\\\textbf{x} graphically. For instance, one may consider a scatter plot of y versus one or more of the predictors. A scatter plot that contains all available regression information is called a sufficient summary plot. When \\\\textbf{x} is high-dimensional, particularly when p\\\\geq 3, it becomes increasingly challenging to construct and visually interpret sufficiency summary plots without reducing the data. Even three-dimensional scatter plots must be viewed via a computer program, and the third dimension can only be visualized by rotating the coordinate axes. However, if there exists a sufficient dimension reduction R(\\\\textbf{x}) with small enough dimension, a sufficient summary plot of y versus R(\\\\textbf{x}) may be constructed and visually interpreted with relative ease. Hence sufficient dimension reduction allows for graphical intuition about the distribution of y\\\\mid\\\\textbf{x}, which might not have otherwise been available for high-dimensional data. Most graphical methodology focuses primarily on dimension reduction involving linear combinations of \\\\textbf{x}. The rest of this article deals only with such reductions.  Dimension reduction subspace  Suppose R(\\\\textbf{x}) = A^T\\\\textbf{x} is a sufficient dimension reduction, where A is a p\\\\times k matrix with rank k\\\\leq p. Then the regression information for y\\\\mid\\\\textbf{x} can be inferred by studying the distribution of y\\\\mid A^T\\\\textbf{x}, and the plot of y versus A^T\\\\textbf{x} is a sufficient summary plot. Without loss of generality, only the space spanned by the columns of A need be considered. Let \\\\eta be a basis for the column space of A, and let the space spanned by \\\\eta be denoted by \\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\eta). It follows from the definition of a sufficient dimension reduction that : F_{y\\\\mid x} = F_{y\\\\mid\\\\eta^Tx}, where F denotes the appropriate distribution function. Another way to express this property is : y\\\\perp\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\perp\\\\textbf{x}\\\\mid\\\\eta^T\\\\textbf{x}, or y is conditionally independent of \\\\textbf{x}, given \\\\eta^T\\\\textbf{x}. Then the subspace \\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\eta) is defined to be a dimension reduction subspace (DRS).Cook, R.D. (1998) Regression Graphics: Ideas for Studying Regressions Through Graphics, Wiley  Structural dimensionality  For a regression y\\\\mid\\\\textbf{x}, the structural dimension, d, is the smallest number of distinct linear combinations of \\\\textbf{x} necessary to preserve the conditional distribution of y\\\\mid\\\\textbf{x}. In other words, the smallest dimension reduction that is still sufficient maps \\\\textbf{x} to a subset of \\\\mathbb{R}^d. The corresponding DRS will be d-dimensional.  Minimum dimension reduction subspace  A subspace \\\\mathcal{S} is said to be a minimum DRS for y\\\\mid\\\\textbf{x} if it is a DRS and its dimension is less than or equal to that of all other DRSs for y\\\\mid\\\\textbf{x}. A minimum DRS \\\\mathcal{S} is not necessarily unique, but its dimension is equal to the structural dimension d of y\\\\mid\\\\textbf{x}, by definition. If \\\\mathcal{S} has basis \\\\eta and is a minimum DRS, then a plot of y versus \\\\eta^T\\\\textbf{x} is a minimal sufficient summary plot, and it is (d + 1)-dimensional.  Central subspace  If a subspace \\\\mathcal{S} is a DRS for y\\\\mid\\\\textbf{x}, and if \\\\mathcal{S}\\\\subset\\\\mathcal{S}_{drs} for all other DRSs \\\\mathcal{S}_{drs}, then it is a central dimension reduction subspace, or simply a central subspace, and it is denoted by \\\\mathcal{S}_{y\\\\mid x}. In other words, a central subspace for y\\\\mid\\\\textbf{x} exists if and only if the intersection \\\\bigcap\\\\mathcal{S}_{drs} of all dimension reduction subspaces is also a dimension reduction subspace, and that intersection is the central subspace \\\\mathcal{S}_{y\\\\mid x}. The central subspace \\\\mathcal{S}_{y\\\\mid x} does not necessarily exist because the intersection \\\\bigcap\\\\mathcal{S}_{drs} is not necessarily a DRS. However, if \\\\mathcal{S}_{y\\\\mid x} does exist, then it is also the unique minimum dimension reduction subspace.  Existence of the central subspace  While the existence of the central subspace \\\\mathcal{S}_{y\\\\mid x} is not guaranteed in every regression situation, there are some rather broad conditions under which its existence follows directly. For example, consider the following proposition from Cook (1998): : Let \\\\mathcal{S}_1 and \\\\mathcal{S}_2 be dimension reduction subspaces for y\\\\mid\\\\textbf{x}. If \\\\textbf{x} has density f(a) > 0 for all a\\\\in\\\\Omega_x and f(a) = 0 everywhere else, where \\\\Omega_x is convex, then the intersection \\\\mathcal{S}_1\\\\cap\\\\mathcal{S}_2 is also a dimension reduction subspace. It follows from this proposition that the central subspace \\\\mathcal{S}_{y\\\\mid x} exists for such \\\\textbf{x}.  Methods for dimension reduction  There are many existing methods for dimension reduction, both graphical and numeric. For example, sliced inverse regression (SIR) and sliced average variance estimation (SAVE) were introduced in the 1990s and continue to be widely used.Li, K-C. (1991) Sliced Inverse Regression for Dimension Reduction In: Journal of the American Statistical Association, 86(414): 316‚Äì327 Although SIR was originally designed to estimate an effective dimension reducing subspace, it is now understood that it estimates only the central subspace, which is generally different. More recent methods for dimension reduction include likelihood-based sufficient dimension reduction,Cook, R.D. and Forzani, L. (2009) Likelihood-Based Sufficient Dimension Reduction In: Journal of the American Statistical Association, 104(485): 197‚Äì208 estimating the central subspace based on the inverse third moment (or kth moment),Yin, X. and Cook, R.D. (2003) Estimating Central Subspaces via Inverse Third Moments In: Biometrika, 90(1): 113‚Äì125 estimating the central solution space,Li, B. and Dong, Y.D. (2009) Dimension Reduction for Nonelliptically Distributed Predictors In: Annals of Statistics, 37(3): 1272‚Äì1298 graphical regression,envelope model, and the principal support vector machine. For more details on these and other methods, consult the statistical literature. Principal components analysis (PCA) and similar methods for dimension reduction are not based on the sufficiency principle.  Example: linear regression  Consider the regression model : y = \\\\alpha + \\\\beta^T\\\\textbf{x} + \\\\varepsilon,\\\\text{ where }\\\\varepsilon\\\\perp\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\perp\\\\textbf{x}. Note that the distribution of y\\\\mid\\\\textbf{x} is the same as the distribution of y\\\\mid\\\\beta^T\\\\textbf{x}. Hence, the span of \\\\beta is a dimension reduction subspace. Also, \\\\beta is 1-dimensional (unless \\\\beta=\\\\textbf{0}), so the structural dimension of this regression is d=1. The OLS estimate \\\\hat{\\\\beta} of \\\\beta is consistent, and so the span of \\\\hat{\\\\beta} is a consistent estimator of \\\\mathcal{S}_{y\\\\mid x}. The plot of y versus \\\\hat{\\\\beta}^T\\\\textbf{x} is a sufficient summary plot for this regression.

For design purposes, the columns are separated into two categories: short columns and slender columns. Short columns The strength of short columns is controlled by the strength of the material and the geometry of the cross section. Reinforcing rebar is placed axially in the column to provide additional axial stiffness. Accounting for the additional stiffness of the steel, the nominal loading capacity Pn for the column in terms of the maximum compressive stress of the concrete fc', the yield stress of the steel fy, the gross cross section area of the column Ag, and the total cross section area of the steel rebar Ast : \\\\begin{align} P_\\\\mathrm{n} &= 0.85f'_\\\\mathrm{c}(A_\\\\mathrm{g} - A_\\\\mathrm{st}) + A_\\\\mathrm{st}f_\\\\mathrm{y}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} where the first term represents the load carried by the concrete and the second term represents the load carried by the steel. Because the yield strength of steel is an order of magnitude larger than that of concrete, a small addition of steel will greatly increase the strength of the column.Microsoft PowerPoint - Lecture 20 - Chapter 9b. Columns Design load To give a conservative estimate and build redundancies into the final structural system, the ACI Building Code Requirements give a maximum reduced design load of \\\\mathrm{{\\\\phi}P_\\\\mathrm{n}}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! where \\\\mathrm{\\\\phi}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the strength reduction factor for the type of column used. For spiral columns : \\\\begin{align} {\\\\phi}P_\\\\mathrm{n(max)} &= 0.85\\\\phi[0.85f'_\\\\mathrm{c}(A_\\\\mathrm{g} - A_\\\\mathrm{st}) + A_\\\\mathrm{st}f_\\\\mathrm{y}]\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} where \\\\mathrm{\\\\phi} = 0.75\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. For tied columns : \\\\begin{align} {\\\\phi}P_\\\\mathrm{n(max)} &= 0.80\\\\phi[0.85f'_\\\\mathrm{c}(A_\\\\mathrm{g} - A_\\\\mathrm{st}) + A_\\\\mathrm{st}f_\\\\mathrm{y}]\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} where \\\\mathrm{\\\\phi} = 0.65\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. The additional reduction past the strength reduction factor is to account for any eccentricities in the loading of column. Distributing a load toward one end of the column will produce a moment in the column and prevent the entire cross section from carrying the load, thus producing high stress concentrations towards that end of the column. =Spiral columns= Spiral columns are cylindrical columns with a continuous helical bar wrapping around the column. The spiral acts to provide support in the transverse direction and prevent the column from barreling. The amount of reinforcement is required to provide additional load-carrying capacity greater than or equal to that attributed from the shell as to compensate for the strength lost when the shell spalls off. With further thickening of the spiral rebar, the axially loaded concrete becomes the weakest link in the system and the strength contribution from the additional rebar does not take effect until the column has failed axially. At that point, the additional strength from spiral reinforcement engages and prevents catastrophic failure, instead giving rise to a much slower ductile failure. The ACI Building Code Requirements put the following restrictions on amount of spiral reinforcement. > ACI Code 7.10.4.2: For cast-in-place construction, size of spirals shall not > be less than 3/8 in. diameter. > ACI Code 7.10.4.3: Clear spacing between spirals shall not exceed 3 in., nor > be less than 1in. Section 10.9.3 adds an additional lower limit to the amount of spiral reinforcement via the volumetric spiral reinforcement ratio œÅs. :{\\\\rho}_{s}=0.45(\\\\frac{A_g}{A_{ch}}-1)\\\\frac{f'_c}{f_{yt}} where Ach is the shell area, the cross-sectional area measured to the outside edges of transverse reinforcement.American Concrete Institute, Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete (ACI 318-08) and Commentary. Ach is the cross-sectional area of a structural member measured to the outside edges of transverse reinforcement. ACI 318-08 pg 19 P = f/A =Tied columns= Tied columns have closed lateral ties spaced approximately uniformly across the column. The spacing of the ties is limited in that they must be close enough to prevent barreling failure between them, and far enough apart that they do not interfere with the setting of the concrete. The ACI codebook puts an upward limit on the spacing between ties. > ACI Code 7.10.5: Vertical spacing of ties shall not exceed 16 longitudinal > bar diameters, 48 tie bar or wire diameters, or least dimension of the > compression member. If the ties are spaced too far apart, the column will experience shearfailure and barrel in between the ties. Slender columns Columns qualify as being slender when their cross sectional area is very small in proportion to their length. Unlike Short Columns, Slender Columns are limited by their geometry and will buckle before the concrete or steel reinforcement yields.  Nonlinear simulation of columns There are some analytical stress-strain models and damage indices for confined and unconfined concretes to simulate reinforced concrete columns that make possible without any experimental test to evaluate the stress-strain relationship and damage of confined and unconfined concretes situated inside and outside of stirrups.

The church and its surrounding monastery is one of the early 16th century monasteries in the vicinity of the Popocatepetl volcano, built initially for evangelization efforts of indigenous people after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. By the 18th century, the church of the monastery began to function as the parish church of the city and in the late 19th century, it was elevated to the rank of a cathedral. Unlike many cathedrals in Mexico, this one does not face the city's main square, but rather is located just to the south, in its own walled compound, which it shares with a number of other structures. Unlike the other monastery structures from its time, the importance of this church provoked a number of renovation projects, the last of which occurred in 1957. This one took out the remaining older decorations of the interior and replaced them with simple modern ones. This renovation work also uncovered a 17th- century mural that covers of the interior walls and narrates the story of Philip of Jesus and twenty three other missionaries who were crucified in Japan. History View of cathedral from behind showing defensive merlons The church was part of the monastery of the Assumption of Mary of Cuernavaca (). This monastery was one of number of large fortress-style monasteries which were built in the early 16th century in what is now northern Morelos and far western Puebla states, near the Popocatepetl volcano. These monasteries were built to evangelize and subdue the indigenous populations shortly after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. These monasteries began the evangelization effort which would spread south towards Oaxaca and Central America then later throughout the colony of New Spain. The organization of the Cuernavaca monastery was founded in 1525 by the first twelve Franciscans to arrive to the new Spanish colony, along with some newer arrivals. Among these were Antonio Maldonado, Antonio Ortiz, Alonso de Herrera and Diego de Almonte. The original purpose of the monastery organization was the evangelization of the local indigenous peoples, and later to house and train missionaries to other parts of New Spain. However, the main church and its walled atrium was originally off limits to all except the Spanish and indigenous nobles. Building of the complex proper began in 1529 on land donated by Juana de Z√∫√±iga de Cort√©s, Hern√°n Cort√©s‚Äôs wife. It was the fifth construction in New Spain by the order and supervised by Toribio de Benavente Motolinia. Like other monasteries of the time, it was built with large, tall, thick walls and with merlons in order to defend the new missionaries from still hostile native peoples. The monastery's lands originally extended far beyond the current complex, and included large gardens and other lands used by the monks to produce food and other needed supplies. The complex, including the church, was built in stages and modified starting from the 16th century. The year of 1532 is engraved in a monogram of the Virgin Mary at the north entrance, but it does not indicate the termination of this facade. It is most likely to have been finished by 1574. According to stories, a monk who died this year was accustomed to climbing onto the roof of the church to see how food reserves were, by checking crops drying on the roofs of indigenous homes. Visiting friar Alonso Ponce wrote in 1585 that the complex was finished and well constructed, and included the church, dormitory and gardens. This same monk notes the retirement and deaths of a number of older monks at the site. Most of the main church was finished by the late 17th century. However, only the outer shell of the main church, along with the ground floor arches of the cloister remain from the earliest construction, due to subsequent remodeling projects. Over its history, this complex, especially the main church, was remodeled several times because of its importance to the evangelization efforts as well as its later importance as a parish church then Cathedral. Of the fourteen early monastery complexes recognized by the World Heritage organization, this is the only one which has experience large scale changes since it was built. In the 17th century, modifications were made to the church, beginning with the construction of two chapels to give it the layout of a Latin cross. The choir area, side altars and other parts were probably added at this time as well. In 1713, a vault similar to a cupola with a ‚Äúliternilla‚Äù and a bell tower on the southeast corner were added to the structure. Unlike, previous work, which was austere, these were Baroque with the usual intricate decoration associated with it. At the foot of the tower, there is a clock. This clock was constructed by a Franciscan father for the Segovia Cathedral. In the 16th century, it was giving to Hern√°n Cort√©s by Charles V. By the middle of the 18th century, interior modifications and additions made it heavily decorated with all types of religious art, including those made of silver and other costly materials. This was also the time that the main church of the monastery began to function as the parish church for the city of Cuernavaca. Main altar area showing rescued mural work and modern additions The buildings and grounds of the monastery/parish remained the same until the latter 19th century, when the Reform Laws closed down and expropriated many monasteries and convents in Mexico. The La Asuncion de Maria monastery was closed and lost most of its lands and many of its buildings, leaving what remains to this day. One of the buildings formerly part of the complex is now the Robert Brady Museum. In 1882, an earthquake toppled the upper part of the tower. Reconstruction was ordered by Father Vicente Salinas y Riveras and supervised by Jos√© Gonzal√©z Belauzaran. In 1891, Pope Leon XIII established the Diocese of Cuernavaca, to administer over the territory of Morelos, converting the Parish of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Asunci√≥n to the Cathedral of Cuernavaca. The first bishop was Fortino Hip√≥lito Vera. In the early 20th century, part of the complex was taken over by Carranza-allied General Pablo Gonz√°lez Garza to use as a headquarters during the Mexican Revolution. By the middle of the 20th century, the church still had some of its former rich decor, including a gilded Churrigueresque main altar, along with two side altars with columns and capitals, along with wood sculpture of the Virgin Mary. One of these capitols is important as it relates to where the celebration of the first mass in Cuernavaca. However, in 1957 the Cathedral underwent another major remodeling by federal government. Some of the work consisted of restoring elements to their original condition. This included the cloister's cells, refectory, library and corridors. Some Baroque elements were added to the bell tower. But the major changes were made in the interior of the main church. The outer layers of plaster were removed, exposing mural work from the 18th century, which covers almost all of the walls of the main nave. This work tells the story of the martyrdom of Phillip of Jesus and other missionaries who were crucified in Nagasaki. The Churringueresque altars and other older elements were mostly taken out and replaced with simple modern elements, especially in the main altar area. The older decorative items were placed in a pinacotheca on the premises but are not available to the public. The cathedral complex became part of the Monasteries on the slopes of Popocat√©petl World Heritage Site in 1994. Description View of the cathedral from the Palace of Cortes in the center of the city The cathedral complex is located in the historical center of the city of Cuernavaca, but unlike other Mexican cities, this most-important church is not on the main plaza but instead just south of it on the corner of Hidalgo and Morelos Streets. The complex consists of a walled compound with the main church, the cloister and several chapels/small churches. The main church and cloister are in the northeast part of the compound, with the other churches/chapels on the sides or corners. This forms the rest of the area or atrium into the shape of an L. This overall layout is the same as it was when it was originally built, although it is somewhat smaller due to subsequent construction. The overall form of this, which used to be only the inner sanctum of the monastery and its lands, was purposefully built away from the population center to give a sense of isolation to both the monks and those visiting. The atrium once functioned as a cemetery, but today it has trees and paths that connect the various elements. Near the center of the atrium is a stone cross on a base, which was probably created before the earliest of the compounds structures. The base is a square prism measuring 1.70 by 1.70 meters. According to some scholars, this is equivalent to a ‚Äúcuauhxicalli‚Äù or stone used for human sacrifice. The use of this as the base was meant to show the triumph of Christianity over native beliefs. The cross proper is made of a single piece of sandstone. The atrium also contains a monument to the memory of ‚Äúcertain Spaniards who were murdered.‚Äù View of the San Jos√© capilla abierta Chapel of Santa Mar√≠a On the west side of the complex, on the south side of both the Cathedral itself and its attached cloister is the capilla abierta (open chapel). This was one of the first constructions of the Spanish built after Hern√°n Cort√©s choose Cuernavaca as a seat over his dominions. The chapel was originally bigger than what remains today. The open chapel here was used not only for Mass, but also for plays, music dance and other events designed to explain and reinforce the faith. The roof of the open chapel is supported by large arches and serves as a portico to the cloister. The cloister today is used as office for the bishopric. It was restored to its former look in the 20th century, with two levels surrounding a central courtyard. The levels have corridors marked off by arches. This cloister retains a number of frescos, some of which depict New Spain missionaries in the Philippines and Japan. The main church has a plain facade with the only element with ornate decoration is the bell tower with also contains a clock. Just inside the main portal, there is a bronze statue of Jesus carrying a cross, a lamb and a book. Just beyond this is a very large stone baptismal font. Inside, the decoration is stark and mostly modern, especially in the main altar area. An equilateral cross with an image of Christ is suspended over the altar area and there are small modern crosses and other elements on the side walls. However, the most important decorative element is an 18th-century narrative mural. This mural was uncovered during the renovation work in the mid 20th century. The mural covers 400 m¬≤ of both side walls of the main nave of the church and tells the story of the arrival and martyrdom of Philip of Jesus and other missionaries in Japan. The mural was probably painted in the middle of the 17th century after the Franciscan missionaries were beatified in 1627. The mural was painted al fresco in a primitive style. Little is known about who painted it or the socio-political context behind its creation. One scholar by the name of Luis Islas Garcia, believes that the artist was a native of Asia who resided in the monastery, assisted by local indigenous people. However, Father Diego Yuki of a museum dedicated to the martyrs in Nagasaki believes that the mural as a purely local work. Phillip of Jesus was beatified in 1627, and canonized in 1629. As the first Mexican saint, as well as a Franciscan, his story would have importance at this establishment. He would have relevance through the colonial period as a symbol of Criollo identity in Mexico. However, this mural was covered over in the 19th century and its existence was forgotten. The work was rediscovered in the 20th century by architect Ricardo Robina when the cathedral was remodeled. Portion of mural work inside the church. The story of the mural begins with Pope Innocence II blessing the 23 missionaries, who later arrived to Japan from the Philippines. There scenes of the twenty three; 16 Japanese and five Spaniards performing missionary work in Kyoto. Then it shows the group in caged carts accompanied by soldiers as they are taken to Nagasaki. The 24th martyr is Phillip of Jesus, who was shipwrecked in Japan. The emperor of Japan, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, offered to spare his life as he had not preached Christianity, but Philip refused and was crucified with the others. For this, he would be canonized as a saint. One legend says that on the day of his death, a fig tree in the family's orchards in Mexico came back to life. The complex also contains pinacotheca or art storage room with archeological pieces as well as paintings and other artworks from the 16th to the 19th centuries. This collection is the result of a number of people but it is considered to have been begun by Francisco Plancarte y Navarrete, the second bishop of Cuernavaca. His personal collection of pre-Hispanic artifacts and rare examples of religious art became part of a historical museum house in two rooms of the Episcopal Palace. Later more religious objects, tapestries and more were added up to the present day. By 1987, this collection was stored in less-than-optimal conditions at the Cathedral complex. Efforts by Juan Dubernard Chavenau, a textile manufacturer and others such as a Mexican project called ‚ÄúAdopt a Work of Art‚Äù eventually convinced the INAH to build more suitable facilities at the complex. It also worked to completely restore the 58 religious paintings in the collection. One series of paintings of particular importance is called the Apostolado... twelve paintings depicting each of the Apostles. This group is one of only three of its kind in Mexico. Other paintings include Ia \\"Estigmatizaci√≥n de San Francisco de As√≠s\\" from the 16th century, a relief which is probably from the original main altar of the church which depicts Saint Francis kneeling receiving the stigmata. Others include \\"La natividad de Ia Virgen Mar√≠a\\" and ‚ÄúSan Francisco Javier‚Äù from the 17th century, ‚ÄúLa √∫ltima cena‚Äù from the 18th century and \\"Jes√∫s calma Ia tormenta\\" by Rafael Flores in the 19th century. The chapels The facade of the Tercera Orden Chapel The most important of the other chapels in the complex is the capilla abierta (open chapel) which is dedicated to Saint Joseph. This structure is one of many built in Mexico in the first half of the 16th century in monasteries, and were usually meant for the saying of mass and other religious activities associated with the mass conversion of the native population at that time. It is possible that Hern√°n Cort√©s had this particular chapel built during the time he lived in Cuernavaca. To construct it, native workers were conscripted from a number of villages around Cuernavaca including de Tletlama, Cuentepec, Miacatla, Temixco, San Francisco Coatl√°n, Mazatepec, San Miguel Coatl√°n, Cuauchichinola, Huajitl√°n, Panchimalco, Tlatenchi, Huitzila, Coajomulco, Ocotepec, Temilpa, Santa Mar√≠a Ahuecatitla, Tetela y Tlaltenango. Unlike many other capillas, this one is a parallel with the axis of the church instead of perpendicular. There are no precedents for this layout either in Mexico or Spain. It is also the portico of the cloister area, the first of its kind in Mexico. It was built this way so that it would back the walled atrium area. The capilla was damaged in the earthquake of 1882. It appears that repairs at this time replaced the original crest. In the interior of the capilla, over the portal of the cloister there is a mural of the \\"Spiritual lineage of Saint Francis of Assisi\\". It represents the life of the founder of the Franciscan order than the saints that it produced. This mural is deteriorated. Today, the open chapel is frequently used for weddings. The next most important chapel in the complex is the Tercera Orden Chapel (Capilla de la Tercera Orden), built the northwest corner of the complex in 1722 by Enrique de Jeres, a Franciscan friar. It would later have a seminary installed in one of its annexes by the first bishop of Cuernavaca, which would become one of the most important educational institutions in the city in the 19th century. This chapel was constructed in a style called popular Baroque along with Churringuersque. The facade has sculptures of angels and saints, some with indigenous headdresses. The bell tower has two levels but it is not tall. The portal on the south side is topped with a seashell formation. Inside, it has a Latin cross layout with one name, divided into an upper choir, nave and apse. The main altar is Baroque, profusely decorated with colorful flowers, angel and saints. This altar was constructed by indigenous craftsmen. The other two large chapels on the site are the Nuestra Se√±ora de los Dolores Chapel and the Santa Cruz Chapel. The first is one of the oldest structures in the compound, constructed before the main church. The Santa Cruz Chapel in Neogothic style, and honors the Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Museum of Religious Art The Museo de Arte Sacro (Museum of Religious Art), which entrance is located in the southwest corner of the church complex, was opened by Bishop Ram√≥n Castro Castro on July 12, 2018. Built at a cost of MXN $36.3 million (U.S. $2 million), the museum houses 92 paintings, sculptures, vestments, and other pieces dating from the 16th to the 21st century. The first room is dedicated to Catholic liturgy and includes La Diosa Tonantzin, a fertility goddess discovered beneath the main altar as well as priestly vestments and other liturgical objects and paintings. The second room is dedicated to St. Francis of Assisi including Estigmatizaci√≥n de San Francisco (Stigmatization of San Francisco) by Andr√©s de la Concha (late 16th century). The third relates to the evangelization of Mexico, with emphasis on Our Lady of Guadalupe. El Se√±or de Chalma con Florones (Lord of Chalma with Rosettes) and La Resurrecci√≥n de Cristo (The Resurrection of Christ), attributed to Jos√© de Ibarra in the 18th century, are found here. Juan Correa is represented by El Nacimiento de la Virgen (Birth of the Virgin) and La Educaci√≥n de la Virgen (Education of the Virgin). Simon Pereyns is represented by La Crucifixi√≥n (The Crucifixion). An entrance fee is charged.

It is formed from the extended mesonephros along with tubules from the posterior nephric ridge. The functional embryonic kidney in anamniotes is the pronephros. Kerr coined the term ‚Äòopisthonephros‚Äô in 1919.

Thus, the term mesonephros is usually reserved for the embryonic kidney of amniotes. The mesonephros and metanephros of amniotes are derived from different parts of the anamniote opisthonephros. The metanephros is derived from the posterior part of the opisthonephros. In amniotes, most of the former opisthonephros became the epididymis, and the archinephric duct became the vas deferens.

On March 1, 1954, Cancel Miranda and three other Nationalists (Lolita Lebr√≥n, Andr√©s Figueroa Cordero, and Irvin Flores Rodr√≠guez) attacked the United States Capitol building, firing 30 shots and injuring five congressmen. The four were arrested, convicted, and sentenced to long prison terms. In 1979, Cancel Miranda was pardoned by United States President Jimmy Carter.  Early years  Cancel Miranda was born in the town of Mayag√ºez, located in the western coast of Puerto Rico. His father, Robert Cancel Rodr√≠guez, was president of the Mayag√ºez chapter of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party and his mother was a member of the Daughters of Freedom, a non-partisan women's organization which was the women's branch of the Nationalist Party. His father, a businessman and owner of a furniture store, had been imprisoned because of his political beliefs.  Ponce massacre  Police fire upon the Nationalists In March 1937, when Cancel Miranda was seven years old, his mother and father traveled to the City of Ponce to participate in a march organized by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. (He and his sisters couldn't go because they were sick with measles). The march, which was scheduled for March 30 (Palm Sunday), was organized to commemorate the ending of slavery in Puerto Rico by the governing Spanish National Assembly in 1873, and to protest the incarceration by the U.S. Government of Nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos on sedition charges. Upon learning of the planned protest, however, the colonial Governor of Puerto Rico at the time, General Blanton Winship, who had been appointed by US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, demanded the immediate withdrawal of the permits. They were withdrawn a short time before the march was scheduled to begin. As \\"La Borinque√±a\\", Puerto Rico's national song, was being played, the demonstrators began to march. They were then fired upon for over 15 minutes by the police from their four positions. About 235 people were wounded and nineteen were killed. Insular Police Retrieved July 9, 2009. Among the dead were 17 unarmed civilians and two police officers at the hands of the Insular Police. Insular Police Retrieved July 9, 2009. Ultimately, responsibility for the massacre fell on Governor Winship, and he is considered to have, in effect, ordered the massacre. Gov. Winship Responsible for the Massacre Retrieved July 9, 2009. Many were chased by the police and shot or clubbed at the entrance of their houses as they tried to escape. Others were taken from their hiding places and killed. Leopold Tormes, a member of the Puerto Rico legislature, told reporters how a policeman murdered a nationalist with his bare hands. Dr. Jos√© N. G√°ndara, one of the physicians who assisted the wounded, testified that wounded people running away were shot, and that many were again wounded by the clubs and bare fists of the police. No arms were found in the hands of the civilians wounded, nor on the dead ones. About 150 of the demonstrators were arrested immediately afterward; they were later released on bail. The incident is known as the Ponce massacre. Biggest Massacre in Puerto Rican History Retrieved July 9, 2009. The white nurse's uniform of Cancel Miranda's mother was soaked with blood as she crawled over bodies in search of her husband. Miraculously, they both managed to return home unharmed. After the family returned home, Cancel Miranda committed his first political act in his first grade class in school when he refused to salute the American flag which at the time was mandatory. Political activist Cancel Miranda joined the Cadets of the Republic (Cadetes de la Rep√∫blica), the youth organization of the Nationalist Party, and organized nationalist youth committees in different towns. His group had a radio program and a small newspaper. As a cadet, Cancel Miranda went to welcome Albizu Campos in December 1947, when the Nationalist Party leader returned from the United States after serving out a ten-year prison sentence - first in the U.S. penitentiary in Atlanta, then in New York - on charges of conspiracy to overthrow the U.S. government and \\"inciting rebellion\\" against it. Following World War II, there was widespread resistance to Washington's attempt to impose English as the main language of instruction in Puerto Rico's schools. Cancel Miranda was among those who participated in a school strike to this respect, two months before his graduation and was expelled from school. He then went to San Juan to finish high school. Puerto Ricans became U.S. citizens as a result of the 1917 Jones-Shafroth Act and those who were eligible, with the exception of women, were expected to serve in the military, either voluntarily or as a result of the military draft (conscription).Eustaquio Correa In 1948, Cancel Miranda, then eighteen and in high school, refused to be drafted into the military. One day, he was walking to school in San Juan with other students, and there was a car with four FBI agents at the corner of his house. He handed his books to the other students to take them to the place where he was living. The men arrested him and charged him with refusing the U.S. draft. The U.S. Federal Court in Puerto Rico sentenced him to two years and one day and he was sent to a prison in Tallahassee, Florida, where he remained from 1949 to 1951. During his stay in prison he confronted a prison guard because of the racist segregation inside prison walls. Under Jim Crow legislation at the time, the prison dormitories were segregated. Self exile in Cuba In the 1950s, the United States entered the Korean War. Believing that he was to be drafted by the US Military and that he would once again face a prison term for refusing, Cancel Miranda followed the advice of his wife and his sister Zoraida and went into a self exile in Cuba. Cancel Miranda arrived in the city of Miranda using a different identity, Robert Rodr√≠guez. Cuba at that time was governed by Carlos Pr√≠o Socarr√°s. He moved to Havana where, with the help of Albizu Campos' son, Pedro Albizu Meneses, he found a job with the Public Works Department. After a while, he went to work for the Raymond Concrete Pipe Co. which was building the L√≠nea Street Tunnel, which connects the two banks of the Almendares River. On October 30, 1950, a Nationalist Party uprising occurred in Puerto Rico. The uprising was a call for independence against the United States Government's rule of Puerto Rico. It was also a protest against the approval of the creation of the political status the \\"Free Associated State of Puerto Rico\\" or how it is legally known, the \\"Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\\" (\\"Estado Libre Asociado\\") for Puerto Rico which was considered a colonial farce.Puerto Rico By Kurt Pitzer, Tara Stevens, page 224, Published by Hunter Publishing, Inc, 2001, , Numerous Nationalists were arrested, among Cancel Miranda's father. In 1951, he published an article in a Havana paper to commemorate the first anniversary of that uprising. The United States embassy learned about it and demanded that the Pr√≠o Socarr√°s government turn him over along with another Puerto Rican, Reynaldo Trilla, but the Cuban authorities ignored them. Aracelio Azcuy, a politician of the Civil Damages Office and supporter of Pr√≠o Socarr√°s, used to ask Cancel Miranda to campaign for him, to write his speeches. On March 10, 1952, Fulgencio Batista led a military coup overthrowing Pr√≠o Socarr√°s' government. After the coup, Batista's police arrested Cancel Miranda and Trilla. They were sent to the Tiscornia prison until August 1952, when they both were expelled from Cuba. Assault on the House of Representatives Cancel Miranda migrated to Brooklyn, New York City, where he joined his wife. He found work in a shoe factory as a press operator. In New York, he met fellow Nationalists Lolita Lebr√≥n, a sewing machine operator, Irvin Flores Rodr√≠guez, a furniture factory employee and Andr√©s Figueroa Cordero, who worked in a butcher shop.  Attack preparations  Albizu Campos had been corresponding with 34-year-old Lolita Lebr√≥n from prison and chose a group of nationalists who included Cancel Miranda, Irvin Flores Rodr√≠guez and Andr√©s Figueroa Cordero to attack locations in Washington, D.C. Upon receiving the order she communicated it to the leadership of the Nationalist party in New York and, although two members unexpectedly disagreed, the plan continued.Ribes Tovar et al., p.132 Lebr√≥n decided to lead the group, even though Albizu Campos did not order her to directly take part in the assault. She studied the plan, determining the possible weaknesses, concluding that a single attack on the House of Representatives would be more effective. The attack was planned for March 1, 1954, as the anniversary of inauguration of the Conferencia Interamericana (Interamerican Conference) in Caracas. Lebr√≥n intended to call attention to Puerto Rico's independence cause, particularly among the Latin American countries participating in the conference.  Trial and imprisonment  Cancel Miranda and his comrades were charged with attempted murder and other crimes. The trial began on June 4, 1954, with judge Alexander Holtzoff presiding over the case, under strict security measures. A jury composed of seven men and five women was assembled, their identities were kept secret by the media. The prosecution was led by Leo A. Rover, as part of this process 33 witnesses testified.Ribes Tovar et al., p.178 Ruth Mary Reynolds, the \\"American/Puerto Rican Nationalist\\" and the organization which she founded \\"American League for Puerto Rico's Independence\\" came to the defense of Cancel Miranda and the three other Nationalists. Cancel Miranda and the other members of the group were the only defense witnesses, as part of Lebr√≥n's testimony she reaffirmed that they \\"came to die for the liberty of her homeland\\".Ribes Tovar et al., p.186Ribes Tovar et al., p.188 On June 16, 1954, the jury declared the four guilty. Rover pursued death penalty, but Holtzoff decided to implement the maximum imprisonment penalties.Ribes Tovar et al., p.193-194 On July 13, 1954, the four nationalists were taken to New York, where they declared themselves not guilty on the charges of \\"trying to overthrow the government of the United States\\".Ribes Tovar et al., p.197 Among the prosecution's witnesses was Gonzalo Lebr√≥n Jr., who testified against his sister. On October 26, 1954, judge Lawrence E. Walsh found all of the accused guilty of conspiracy, sentencing them to six additional years in prison.Ribes Tovar et al., p.209 The four Nationalists were incarcerated at different prisons. Figueroa Cordero was sent to the federal penitentiary in Atlanta; Lebr√≥n to the women's prison in Alderson, West Virginia; and Flores Rodr√≠guez to Leavenworth, Kansas, where Oscar Collazo, who in 1950 attacked the Blair House in a failed attempt to assassinate US President Harry S. Truman, was incarcerated. Cancel Miranda, considered to be the primary shooter, received a prison sentence of 85 years and was sent to Alcatraz in the San Francisco Bay.  Imprisonment   Alcatraz  In July 1954, Cancel Miranda, inmate number 1163, was sent to Alcatraz where he served six years of his sentence. Alcatraz Island operated as a Federal Bureau of Prisons federal prison from August 1934 to 1963. While incarcerated, Cancel Miranda worked in the brush factory and served as an altar boy at Catholic services. His closest friends were fellow Puerto Ricans Em√©rito V√°zquez and Hiram Crespo-Crespo. On the recreation yard, he played chess with Harlem gangster Ellsworth \\"Bumpy\\" Johnson.\\"Former Alcatraz inmate speaks about his time\\", Examiner San Francisco, by D. Morita; October 9, 2009 He also befriended Morton Sobell, an American convicted of espionage; they remained friends Sobell's death in December 2018. During visitation, Cancel Miranda was not allowed to see his children. His wife was allowed to see him in the visiting room, where there was a glass partition, and they could talk using a phone, but were not allowed to speak in Spanish. Due to Cancel Miranda's good behavior in prison, he was transferred to USP Leavenworth in 1960.  Leavenworth  Cancel Miranda spent 10 years in Leavenworth. In 1970, he, Andr√©s Figueroa Cordero (he was transferred from the federal penitentiary in Atlanta), Irvin Flores Rodr√≠guez and Oscar Collazo organized a prisoners' strike to protest their treatment by the guards. Cancel Miranda was charged with organizing the strike and sentenced to solitary confinement for five months. His wife, who had traveled to visit him during that time, was allowed to see him for one hour. During his imprisonment, in Leavenworth, a photo from a local newspaper reminded him of one of his Cuban experiences, which allowed him to recognize that a genuine revolution was taking place in that country.  Marion  Cancel Miranda was transferred to the Marion Penitentiary, a Federal Bureau of Prisons facility located in Southern Precinct, unincorporated Williamson County, Illinois. By the late 1960s, there were increasing numbers of prisoners engaged in political activity, and Cancel Miranda joined them. In prison, he read books on sociology and learned to play the guitar. He also became involved in the defense of Corky Gonzales and the \\"Crusade for Justice\\". Every September 16, Cancel Miranda would join the Mexican and Chicano prisoners in marking Mexico's independence day with a work stoppage. He was also involved in the African-American struggle. Together they produced newspapers like the Chicano prisoners' paper Aztl√°n and the Militant. In 1972, he was placed in the Control Unit, where he was held for eighteen months, after a big strike in Marion. In the early years there was no campaign for the release of the Nationalist prisoners. An Afro-American prisoner named Ed Johnson wrote to Michael Deutsch, a lawyer, and invited him to visit the Control Unit. The campaign for the release of the Nationalists began with Michael Deutsch and Mara Siegel from the People's Law Office. When Cancel Miranda's father died in 1977, his supporters campaigned to allow him to attend the funeral. He was eventually granted a seven-hour furlough in Puerto Rico to attend the funeral.  Pardon and later years  In 1979, President Jimmy Carter pardoned Cancel Miranda, Lolita Lebr√≥n and Irving Flores Rodr√≠guez after they had served 25 years in prison. Andr√©s Figueroa Cordero was released from prison earlier because of ill health. Governor of Puerto Rico Carlos Romero Barcel√≥ publicly opposed the pardons, arguing that it would encourage terrorism and undermine public safety. Cancel Miranda and the other Nationalists received a hero's welcome upon their return to Puerto Rico. President Carter also commuted the sentence of fellow nationalist Oscar Collazo, to time served on September 6, 1979, after spending 29 years in jail. Collazo had been eligible for parole since April 1966, and Lebr√≥n since July 1969. Both Cancel Miranda and Flores Rodr√≠guez became eligible for parole in July 1979. However, none had applied for parole because of their political beliefs.Jimmy Carter: Puerto Rican Nationalists Announcement of the President's Commutation of Sentences The Order of Playa Gir√≥n Cancel Miranda authored nine books and remained active in the struggle for Puerto Rican independence. He continued to carry the cause of independence to other countries and returned occasionally to the United States on speaking tours on behalf of Puerto Rican political prisoners. In 1979, at the International Conference in Support of Independence for Puerto Rico, held in Mexico City, Cancel Miranda. Irvin Flores Rodr√≠guez, Lolita Lebr√≥n, and Oscar Collazo were recognized as the embodiment of the directive of their teacher Albizu Campos to exercise valor and sacrifice before representatives of fifty-one countries. That same year Cancel Miranda was awarded the Order of Playa Gir√≥n. The Order of Playa Gir√≥n is a national order conferred by the Council of State of Cuba on Cubans or foreigners for their leadership in the struggle against imperialism, colonialism and neo-colonialism, or who have contributed to peace and the progress of humankind. It was established in 1961 and is named after the Playa Gir√≥n (Gir√≥n beach), site of the Cuban victory in the Bay of Pigs Invasion. In 2006, he was awarded the \\"Order of Jos√© Mart√≠\\" by the Cuban government for his work. It is the highest honor Cuba accords to non-Cubans. A musical production of his poetry, \\"Por Las Calles de Mi Patria\\", was well received in Puerto Rico and in the United States. The poems are those he had sent to his father while in prison. He had thought them lost and was surprised to find them published by his father. The musical production is dedicated to those active in the struggle for independence. Oscar L√≥pez Rivera founded the Robert Cancel Miranda High School in Chicago, in his honor. The school is now known as the Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos High School and the Juan Antonio Corretjer Puerto Rican Cultural Center.Rosales, Francisco. Dictionary of Latino Civil Rights History.

Etymology The specific epithet \\"inescatus\\" is derived from the Latin word \\"inescare\\" (to bait). It refers to the structure at the back of the head and front of the spine, shaped like an anglerfish's esca, which Williams theorizes may be used as bait for luring prey, in a style similar to anglerfish, or as a means to attract potential mates. The species' common name, \\"flagfin stargazer\\" refers to the structure's resemblance to a small flag atop the blenny's spine.

The adult tree is from tall, with a rounded canopy. The trunk can be diameter, with a thick () and irregular corky bark. The flowers are white, wide. They occur either alone or in threes, and open between August and September, undergoing both self- and cross-pollination. The fruits (up to 1500 per tree) ripen mostly over a two-month period, between September and December depending on the climate. They fall from the tree when fully ripe, roughly at the start of the rainy season. The fruit is a yellow-orange berry, roughly spherical in shape, with a dry remnant of the calyx opposite to the stem; it is about one inch () in diameter and usually weighs . It has a thin waxy skin and a sweet-sour and slightly astringent pulp, 1‚Äì2 mm thick, loosely enclosing one to three round and light gray seeds. Uses The fruits is edible raw, but when consumed in quantity it has a laxative effect ‚Äî which justifies the species name dysenterica (as well as the local Portuguese name). It keeps for three days at room temperature, or 10 days if refrigerated. It is locally used for sweets, jams, beverages, and sherbets, either at home or by small-scale industries. It contains substantial quantities of polyunsaturated fatty acids (chiefly linoleic acid and linolenic acid) and vitamin C (18 mg/100g). Unripe berries can be used for cattle feed. The wood is dense (0.82 g/cm¬≥), hard, and finely grained, but of inferior quality; it is used for fence posts, firewood, charcoal, and occasionally for rustic furniture and other light construction. The bark is used for tanning leather and for cork products; it is also used in folk medicine against dysentery. The leaves are used for cattle feed, and in folk medicine as heart tonic and as treatment for dysentery, diabetes, and jaundice. The oil extracted from the leaves has been claimed to have antifungal properties (against Cryptococcus neoformans). Its numerous bright berries and dark green foliage earned it some use as a decorative plant. Cultivation The plant can be easily reproduced from seeds (which contain about 50% water and cannot whitstand drying). Planted deep, they germinate in 40 to 60 days. It can also be reproduced in vitro from gems. The plant is adapted to the poor soils of the Cerrado but benefits from fertilizers containing calcium and phosphorus as well as organic fertilizers. Agricultural pests include the brown spot disease, caused by a fungus (Phleosporella sp.), leaf-cutting ants, and fruit flies such as Anastrepha obliqua.

He previously played for the Tampa Bay Rays. Originally drafted by the Kansas City Royals, he was later traded to the Rays. He won the AL Rookie of the Year Award in 2013. Early career Myers attended and played baseball at Wesleyan Christian Academy in High Point, North Carolina. As a freshman, Myers had a .450 batting average and was an all-state third baseman. During his junior year, he went 10‚Äì0 as a pitcher. After committing to the University of South Carolina, Myers was drafted by the Kansas City Royals. In 2008, his team won a state championship. Professional career Kansas City Royals Myers was drafted by the Kansas City Royals as a catcher in the third round, with the 91st overall selection, of the 2009 Major League Baseball draft. Myers signed a contract with the Royals, that included a $2 million signing bonus, in August 2009. Before the draft, Myers had committed to South Carolina during his junior year. Myers in with the Wilmington Blue Rocks Myers made his debut in professional baseball in 2009, when he played catcher and batted .369 with five home runs in 84 at bats with Royals' Rookie League affiliates, the Idaho Falls Chukars and the Burlington Royals. Myers began the 2010 season playing catcher for the Burlington Bees of the Midwest League and was named to the Midwest League All Star team. On July 1, 2010, the Royals promoted Myers to the Wilmington Blue Rocks of the Carolina League, a league generally considered more advanced than those in which he had previously played. Myers played catcher and finished the 2010 season batting .315 with a .429 on-base percentage overall, and totaled 14 home runs, 83 runs batted in, and 85 walks between his time in the Midwest League and Carolina League. In 2011, playing for the Class AA Northwest Arkansas Naturals, he batted .254 with eight home runs and 49 RBIs in 99 games. He played primarily outfield in 2012, and was named to appear in the 2012 All-Star Futures Game. Tampa Bay Rays =2013: Rookie year= Tampa Bay Rays in 2013 On December 9, 2012, Myers was traded to the Tampa Bay Rays (along with Jake Odorizzi, Patrick Leonard, and Mike Montgomery) in exchange for James Shields, Wade Davis, and a player to be named later (later chosen to be Elliot Johnson). He started the 2013 season with the Triple-A Durham Bulls of the International League. On June 17, Myers was called up to the Rays, for whom he played outfield. Myers won the AL Rookie of the Year award in 2013, beating teammate and pitcher Chris Archer and Detroit shortstop Jos√© Iglesias. In spite of the fact that he did not join the Rays until their 70th game on June 18, Myers led AL rookies with a 53 RBIs in the 88 games he played. The last player to lead AL rookies in RBIs in fewer than 90 games was Hoot Evers playing for the Detroit Tigers in 1946, when he had 33 in 81 games. He also became the first-ever hitter to win the award in under 100 games. In the post-season, he had two singles in 20 at bats. = 2014 = Myers entered 2014 as the Rays' everyday right fielder. On May 4, Myers hit his first career inside-the-park home run. During a game against the Boston Red Sox on May 30, Myers collided with Desmond Jennings while attempting to catch a fly ball, resulting in a stress fracture in Myer's right wrist which required a cast and significant rehab time. Myers returned to the club on August 20, initially slotted as a DH before returning to the field. In 2014, he batted .222/.294/.320 with six home runs and 35 RBIs in 325 at bats. San Diego Padres On December 19, 2014, the Rays traded Myers, Ryan Hanigan, and Jose Castillo to the San Diego Padres as part of a three-team transaction, in which the Padres traded Jake Bauers, Burch Smith, and Ren√© Rivera to the Rays, the Padres traded Joe Ross and Trea Turner to the Washington Nationals, and Washington traded Steven Souza and Travis Ott to Tampa Bay. =2015= Myers was the Padres 2015 Opening Day center fielder and manned the position through April and into May. Myers went on the disabled list in early May with tendinitis in his left wrist, and missed a month. After returning for only three games in June, he went back on the disabled list as the wrist continued to bother him. Myers returned from the DL on September 4 after a surgical procedure to shave down a bone spur irritating the tendon. Following his return, Myers began playing first base in addition to the outfield, with Melvin Upton Jr. and Travis Jankowski getting most of the starts in center after the trade of Will Venable. In 2015, he batted .253/.336/.427 with eight home runs and 29 RBIs in 225 at bats. =2017= On January 17, 2017, Myers signed a six-year $83 million extension with the Padres. Myers hit for the cycle on April 10, 2017 at Coors Field against the Colorado Rockies. It was the second cycle in Padres history. On September 2, a commemorative bobblehead celebrating his accomplishment was handed out to fans at Petco Park. For the season, Myers continued to hit for power, hitting 30 home runs, and speed, stealing 20 bases. He tied for the National League lead in power-speed number (24.0). However, his consistency declined, as the season saw him striking out 180 times, the second-highest total in the National League, with his batting average declining to .243, and him hitting just .222 with runners in scoring position. On defense, he played almost exclusively first base. =2018= In early April, Myers suffered from nerve irritation in his right arm and was placed on the disabled list, and on April 28 he suffered a left oblique strain and was again placed on the disabled list. On July 7, Myers hit three homers in a 20‚Äì5 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks. The 15-run loss was the first time in Major League history that a team had a player hit three home runs and go on to lose by double digits. On August 4, he was placed on the disabled list with a bruised left foot. Myers was involved in a controversy in early September, when footage emerged during a live stream of teammate Carlos Asuaje playing the video game Fortnite involved Myers, chatting with Asuaje while playing, criticizing manager Andy Green. Myers apologized to Green and took responsibility for the remarks. He ended the season batting .253 with 11 home runs and 39 RBIs in 83 games. He played 41 games in the outfield, 36 at third base, and two at first base. In his major league career through 2018, Myers played 329 games at first base, 248 games in the outfield, and 37 games at third base. =2019= Over the offseason before the 2019 season, the Padres signed superstar third baseman Manny Machado, which moved Wil Myers to the outfield. Due to the emergence of corner outfielders Franmil Reyes and Hunter Renfroe in 2018 while Myers was injured, he was also involved in trade rumors, but nothing materialized. On opening day, Myers hit the first home run of the Padres season. On April 15, Myers hit his 100th career home run in a home loss to the Rockies. However, 2019 was considered a lost season for Myers, as he struck out in well over 30% of his plate appearances, struggled mightily in \\"clutch\\" situations, and fell out of favor with Green and management, while also being booed at home by San Diego fans at times. Following the DFA of Robbie Erlin on October 31, Myers became the longest-tenured Padre. =2020= In the 2020 season shortened by COVID-19, Myers played in 55 of the 60 games and batted .288/.353/.606 with 15 home runs and 40 RBIs. On August 18, Myers hit a grand slam in a 6-4 road win against the Texas Rangers, which extended San Diego‚Äôs grand slam streak to 2 games. Two days later, the Padres would make history as the first team in MLB history to hit a grand slam in four consecutive games. Personal life Myers' parents are Eric and Pamela Myers. He has a younger brother named Beau who pitched to him in the 2016 Home Run Derby. He married Maggie Reaves on November 3, 2018.

It was published bi-weekly. In its earlier days, the comic generally focused on slice of life stories involving Ananth, Yuko, and their friends and family following graduation from college. However, the comic occasionally encompasses unrelated fantasy storylines. The comic is currently focusing on one of its ongoing fictional storylines, \\"Barbarous.\\" The name \\"Johnny Wander\\" is meant to evoke the creators' desire to use the comic to \\"wander\\" through whatever topics interest them at the moment. The webcomic has been generally well-received, with reviewers calling it as a humorous and sweet comic that invites new readers to continue reading. The artwork has also been praised for its depth and quality. The first physical book collection \\"Johnny Wander Vol. 1: Don't Burn the House Down\\" was published in 2010. History Ota and Hirsh at New York Comic Con in 2011 From 2006 to 2010, Ananth Hirsh (then called Ananth Panagariya) wrote the webcomic AppleGeeks, in collaboration with the artist Mohammad Haque. This strip was published as a comic book by Dark Horse Comics in 2008. Hirsh and Ota started posting Johnny Wander in 2008. Originally intended to encompass more subjects than autobiography, Ota picked the name \\"Johnny Wander\\" because it sounded both catchy and broad in scope. The name implied that the two could \\"wander\\" to whatever subject they were interested in. The first few test strips were done sporadically, as Ota was attending school and Hirsh was working full-time as a graphic designer. They eventually decided on autobiographical work because it seemed quicker to do, though the webcomic quickly became focused and polished. A collection of the comics, entitled Johnny Wander Vol. 1: Don‚Äôt Burn the House Down, was published in 2010. The book was released under a Creative Commons license. A second and third volume were subsequently published, entitled \\"Johnny Wander Vol. 2: Escape to New York\\" and \\"Johnny Wander Vol. 3: Ballad of Laundry Cat\\", respectively. Hirsh and Ota have stopped updating the comic as of June 2019. Style and format The webcomic generally focuses on slice of life storylines involving the lives of the creators and their friends. Occasionally, it ventures into surrealist short fantasy stories. Each comic consists of a stand-alone, single page comic. Often, the inspiration for a comic comes from a simple conversation or occurrence in the characters' everyday lives. However, one storyline, The Girl with the Skeleton Hand, involves a woman's romance with a personified death. \\"Delilah and the Basilisk\\" and \\"Lucky Penny\\" are among the other serial fiction pieces published on the site. The artwork is inked by hand and done in grayscale. First, a strip is penciled, then inked with a brush, and finally shaded and toned in Adobe Photoshop. Characters *Ananth Hirsh - The comic writer, he describes himself as a comic book nerd. His hat constantly obscures his eyes, which are never seen. *Yuko Ota - The comic illustrator and inker. Attended college with Conrad and John. *Conrad - Originally a roommate of the two main characters, Conrad likes to eat breakfast constantly. *John - Another former roommate of the group; John often spouts seemingly random and surreal statements unrelated to the situation. Reception Greg McElhatton of Read About Comics called Johnny Wander one of his favorite webcomics. He went on to describe it as \\"consistently funny and sweet\\", and praised it for its comedic timing and sharp character art. Arun Kale of Helter Skelter magazine called the webcomic \\"a light-hearted, honest look at life\\". Gary Tyrrell of Fleen compared Johnny Wander to Archie Comics in its accessibility and ability to make new readers feel welcome. Mike Braff of Suvudu praised the webcomic, calling its writing good and its art \\"breathtaking\\". In 2017, Our Cats Are More Famous Than Us: A Johnny Wander Collection won an Ignatz Award for \\"Outstanding Collection\\".

According to eyewitnesses the death occurred after an altercation in Goumas' store, when the three men demanded that Goumas not speak to them in Greek in his own store, which Goumas refused. The suspects reportedly drove over the victim at least twice to make sure he was dead. The death sent shockwaves through the ethnic Greek community of Albania, and demonstrators blocked the main highway from Vlor√´ to Sarand√´, which passes through the region. The event was reported by all major news outlets in both countries, and was strongly condemned by both the Greek and Albanian governments. Three suspects have been charged with murder and are awaiting trial. Incident On the morning of Thursday, August 12, 2010, three Albanian men from the town of Vlor√´ accosted Goumas in his store in the predominantly ethnic Greek town of Himar√´, and demanded that he not speak to them in Greek according to eyewitnesses. According to eyewitness reports, Goumas refused, resulting in an altercation. The three men then assaulted Goumas. Several hours later, as Goumas was leaving his store, patrons at the store saw the three men leave in a hurry. Suspecting something to be amiss, friends of the 37-year-old followed them and found Goumas a short distance outside the town lying bleeding on the pavement, his motorcycle bearing marks of a hit and run. According to police reports, the suspects had rammed Goumas' motorcycle with their Audi, injuring him fatally. The suspects reportedly drove over the victim twice, so as to make sure he was dead, then fled the scene. Reaction The death and lack of immediate police response sparked outrage throughout the predominantly ethnic Greek region of Himar√´. Demonstrators blocked the main highway between the towns of Vlor√´ and Sarand√´ using rocks, while municipal workers in the town of Himar√´ held a work stoppage. According to the Himariote Union, the death of Goumas was the culmination of a series of recent provocations in the town of Himar√´ by Albanian nationalists. Local Greeks further called for the replacement of certain individuals in the Himar√´ police force, stating that attacks against ethnic Greeks have occurred frequently in the past and been duly reported, without the local police authorities showing the slightest interest. Initial reports in the Albania news media characterized the incident as a traffic accident resulting from road rage. However, Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha issued an unusually strong condemnation of the incident, calling the incident an \\"act of extreme and blind fanaticism\\" and demanding that police authorities make every effort to find the perpetrators and bring them to justice. The death of Goumas was also condemned by the main opposition Albanian Socialist Party and the Socialist Movement for Integration party. The ethnic Greek mayor of Himar√´, Vasil Bollano, spoke of a \\"premeditated crime\\" as the suspects had been \\"provoking the victim for days\\". Vangjel Dule, leader of the Unity for Human Rights Party, which champions the rights Greek minority in Albania, called for restructuring of the police force in Himar√´, and for greater recruitment of local Himariotes to the local force. The death was reported by all major news outlets in Greece, and was strongly condemned by the Greek government. George Papandreou, the Prime Minister of Greece, strongly condemned the incident, adding that \\"the rise of nationalism among extremist groups targeting the Greek minority in Albania is a very serious matter\\". Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman Dimitris Delavekouras said that the perpetrators acted out of ethnic prejudice and that such incidents were designed to stir ethnic tensions and undermine Greek-Albanian relations. He called for \\"swift and proper\\" justice and further underlined that respect for minorities is one of the conditions for EU membership. The main opposition New Democracy (ND) party and the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) also sharply condemned the incident and called on the Greek government to take all necessary measures to ensure that a full investigation and judicial actions are taken. The issue was brought to the European Parliament by three Parliamentary Questions.European Parliament (2010) Tension in northern Epirus, Question of 20 Sept. 2010. The Albanian police were slothish at first, having ignored the victim's many pleas to them in the days beforehand. Only after the outcry following the murder did they being to treat the incident as a homicide and launch a manhunt in the region; they arrested seven individuals aged 19 to 22, while the main suspect remained at large. The main suspect, Ilir Mukaj from Vlor√´, surrendered to police late on Sunday, August 15. Seven people were eventually charged in all: Three for the murder of Goumas, and the other four for hiding the murder suspects. Several days after the incident, two cars driving on the road from Vlor√´ to Sarand√´ stopped in front of the Goumas family residence and fired bullets into the air. The Goumas family, which was in the house at the time, notified the police, who took eyewitness statements and collected bullet casings. According to diplomatic sources, there has recently been an upsurge in nationalist activity among Albanians, especially following the ruling of the International Court of Justice in favour of Kosovo's independence.

Necanicum Junction is about a mile east of the site of the former post office, at the intersection of U.S. 26 and Oregon Route 53. It is served by the Seaside post office. The post office at this locale was originally named \\"Ahlers\\" after Herman Ahlers, a local resident and the first postmaster. Ahlers changed the name of the office to \\"Push\\" in 1899, because he expected the place to become an enterprising community. The name was changed to Necanicum in 1907, after the Necanicum River, and the office closed in 1916, with Ahlers still postmaster. \\"Necanicum\\" is one of many names in northwest Oregon beginning with ne, which is a Native American prefix indicating a place. Necanicum is derived from Ne-hay-ne-hum, the name of a Native American lodge upstream. The journal of the Oregon Pioneer Association gave the name as \\"Nekonikon\\" in 1887. Herman Ahlers said the name meant \\"a gap in the mountains\\". The current spelling was adopted by a decision of the United States Board on Geographic Names in 1915, as the most common local usage over \\"Necanacum\\" and \\"Nekanakum\\". In 1915, Necanicum had a population of 50. As of 1990, there was a store and a caf√© at Necanicum Junction.

Ireland & Aircraft Leasing Ireland is one of the world's leading jurisdictions for aircraft finance and leasing. The Irish industry traces its roots back to the foundation of Guinness Peat Aviation in Shannon, County Clare in 1975 and in the intervening period the aircraft leasing, trading and brokerage industry has proved to be one of Ireland's greatest success stories. As one of the world's major centres for aircraft lessors, a survey conducted by the Federation of Aerospace Enterprises in Ireland estimated that aviation leasing companies in Ireland manage assets worth in the region of ‚Ç¨82.9 billion. It is estimated that in excess of US$100 billion of capital will be required every year to finance all the aircraft delivered by manufacturers and aircraft leasing is approaching 40% of the global aircraft financing market. The market has grown as more airlines have concluded that it is better to lease (rent) aircraft which provides for greater flexibility in the aircraft fleet. Some lessors expect the leased component share of the global aircraft fleet to rise to as much as 50% in the next several years. Thought Leadership Project i, Positioning Ireland at the Forefront of Global Startup Innovation In April 2019, Avolon issued a White Paper entitled \\"Project i\\" which assessed Ireland's start-up ecosystem when compared to best-in-class around the world. The report provides recommendations on how Ireland could close the gap with international best- practices; improve its global standing and provide the necessary support for entrepreneurs. India, a 21st-century Powerhouse In July 2018, Avolon published a white paper titled ‚ÄòIndia, a 21st Century Powerhouse‚Äô, which provides an in-depth analysis of India's air travel market. The paper is divided in two parts; the first section details the factors impacting India's commercial airline sector, while the second part contains an analysis of the Indian aviation market, including a detailed breakdown of the major passenger markets, airline fleets and future growth projections. The paper forecasted that the India's current passenger fleet will double to almost 1,100 aircraft by 2027 ‚Äì with the total value of aircraft to be delivered over the coming ten years, at current list prices, projected to be $60 billion. The paper also highlighted that there is a shortfall of 300 aircraft in India's commercial aviation orderbook, which are required to meet the growth in demand over the next ten years. The demand is fuelled in large part by a forecasted annual growth of domestic and international passenger demand of 9.6% and 8.3% respectively. China, The Land of Silk and Money During first half of 2017, Avolon published a White Paper series titled ‚ÄòThe Land of Silk and Money‚Äô, which analysed the Chinese aviation market. The first part of this series, issued in March 2017, looked at the development, growth and gradual maturing of China's domestic airline industry and the key drivers of growth over the next decade. The second part, which was published in May 2017, analysed China's international inbound and outbound travel markets. The paper forecasted that Chinese airlines required an additional 3,200 additional aircraft by 2026, to meet future fleet requirements of China's airline industry. At the time of publication, over 50% of these had still to be ordered, including 1,150 narrowbody aircraft, 400 widebody aircraft and 150 regional jets. The Economic Life of Aircraft In September 2012, Avolon published an analysis of commercial aircraft economic lives and retirement patterns. The purpose was to test whether the current assumptions made by airlines, aviation investors and aircraft financiers, on the economic life of commercial jets - that aircraft should be depreciated over a useful life of approximately 25 years - remains valid. The reason this analysis is so relevant today is that approximately 8,000 aircraft are due to be retired over the next 10 years. This is more than the total number of aircraft retired since commercial aviation began in the 1960s. The Avolon analysis considers how trends in aircraft retirement have changed over time and identifies key differences between the behaviour of specific aircraft types. The paper also considers the likely impact on retirement trends and aircraft economic values of the retirement of newer fleets, including current Airbus A320 and Boeing 737NG aircraft. The Transition to Neo and MAX Aircraft In February 2013 Avolon published an analysis of, and investor guide to, the expected market impact of the transition to new generation Airbus (320Neo) and Boeing (737MAX) single aisle aircraft families. This was Avolon's second white paper on industry issues and considered how the transition from A320ceo/737NG aircraft to A320Neo/737MAX aircraft will influence the single aisle aircraft market over the rest of the decade and beyond. The Avolon paper found that the effect of the Neo and Max models on the value of their predecessors will be limited by the sheer number of current-generation craft in use today and the high portion of the global aircraft fleet approaching retirement. The authors predict that sharper rises in passenger numbers in developing countries will fuel demand for both Neo and Max models, but also, importantly, current- generation aircraft as airlines seek to add capacity but find themselves at the end of long lines for the new models. Both Airbus and Boeing currently have record-high order backlogs, making the second-hand market an appealing option for fast-growing carriers. Aircraft Retirement and Storage Trends In March 2015, Avolon published an updated analysis of the key factors that influence the economic life of commercial jet aircraft building on the analysis issued in September 2012. The 2015 analysis also addresses aircraft retirement and storage trends. The paper concluded that the patterns of retirement behaviour had not materially changed since the 2012 analysis, with the average aircraft retirement age stable at or around 25 years and more than 50% of fleets remaining in service beyond 25 years. Documentary on Irish Aviation: 'Pioneers and Aviators' In November 2013, Avolon announced it had commissioned a documentary on the history of Irish Aviation titled: \\"Pioneers and Aviators, A Century of Irish Aviation. The documentary tells the story of the remarkable, pioneering individuals whose vision, passion, successes and failures helped forge Ireland's unique aviation landscape. The documentary traces this story from its humble beginnings when Alcock and Brown made the first transatlantic flight, landing in a field in the West of Ireland, through the evolution of Aer Lingus and the development of airports at Foynes, Shannon and Dublin, the pivotalemergence of Tony Ryan, the meteoric rise and fall of GPA, the enduring dominance of Ryanair, culminating in a focus on the contemporary story of Ireland's leading role in aviation today. The documentary Writer and Director, Alan Gilsenan, is an award-winning film- maker, writer and theatre director. His film work has appeared on the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, RT√â, the History Channel and CNBC among others. The score for the documentary was written by renowned Irish composer M√≠che√°l √ì S√∫illeabh√°in working with the RT√â Concert Orchestra. The premiere of the documentary took place in the Irish National Concert Hall, Dublin on Wednesday 22 January 2014. The documentary was screened in two 52 minute episodes on RT√â Television on 20 and 27 February 2014 In June 2015, Avolon launched a commemorative photographic book of the same name - Pioneers and Aviators, A Century of Irish Aviation. The book was formally launched by the Taoiseach Enda Kenny TD, together with Domhnal Slattery, Avolon CEO; Eamonn Brennan, Chief Executive of the Irish Aviation Authority; and Brigadier General Paul Fry, GOC of the Air Corps at an event at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, Co. Dublin. Europe's First MSc in Aviation Finance In April 2016, Europe's first MSc in Aviation Finance was launched at the UCD Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School. Avolon, together with a number of other leading aircraft leasing firms, is an industry partner of the new master's degree. The course is intended to sustain Ireland's position as the world's largest centre for aviation finance and leasing. Initiatives with the Royal Hibernian Academy In October 2015, as part of its corporate and social responsibility programme, Avolon announced two initiatives with the Royal Hibernian Academy (RHA): The Avolon Global Studio and Avolon Youthreach Programme. The programme was launched by Domhnal Slattery, Avolon CEO; Mick O‚ÄôDea RHA President; and Patrick T. Murphy, RHA Director. Avolon Global Studio: With Avolon's support the RHA made a global call-out for an artist who will be awarded a 6-month studio placement, at the RHA during 2016, 2017 and 2018 with the first residency commencing in July 2016. This studio residency offers a once in a lifetime opportunity for an international, emerging artist to raise their profile on a global platform and to develop their practice within the environs of one of Ireland's leading contemporary art organisations. In April 2016 Avolon and the RHA announced the first participant of the Avolon Global Studio Programme would be Colombian artist, Adriana Salazar. The second artist to join the Avolon Global Studio Programme in 2017 was Iranian artist, Jinoos Taghizadeh. The third artist to receive the Avolon Global Studio Award will be selected from India. Avolon Youthreach Programme: Collaborating with the national Youthreach scheme, the RHA will invite 6 young students, selected from submissions from the 160 Youthreach Centres nationwide, to participate in four workshops to increase their art skills, introduce them to visiting art galleries and art colleges and offer basic tools of criticism. As well as developing practical skills, by working alongside a practicing artist, this opportunity will offer students the ability to explore the opportunities and challenges of being a professional artist in Ireland today.

In the course of his career, he killed six highwaymen and made several important captures. He is known for participating in one of the classic gun duels of the Old West, and for being one of the most fearless lawmen of the California Gold Rush era. Early years Venard was born on a farm in Lebanon, Ohio, USA. He received his education at Waynesville Academy in Waynesville, Ohio. After moving to Newport (now Fountain City), Indiana, Venard became the first teacher of the joint town and township school. Because of his participation with the Underground Railroad, a bounty was put on him, so he headed to California in March 1850 with a group of 24 others in covered wagons, arriving in September 1850. Career Early on upon reaching California's Gold country, Venard tried his hand at gold mining, settling first in Colfax, but by December 1850, he had moved to the North Fork of the American River. In 1851, he moved again, through Downieville, and then to Nevada City. He decided to make Nevada City his home, and by 1853, had opened a grocery store on Broad Street. By 1854, he became a partner in operating the Empire Mining Company. In 1855, he became a Nevada County deputy but resigned the following year. He ran for the office of Sheriff against Henry Plummer in 1857 but lost. In 1864, Venard was elected a part-time City Marshal in Nevada City. He also worked as a detective, Wells Fargo guard and special officer. Venard on the job Considered at the time as the \\"most remarkable cleanup of road agents on record\\", Venard tracked and killed three Wells Fargo stagecoach robbers on May 15, 1866 in the Yuba River's Myers' Ravine with four shots from his Henry rifle, returned the stolen $8,000 of gold dust, and then apologized for the excess shot. When offered a reward by Wells Fargo, Venard accepted only half, and split the rest with his posse. He received an inscribed, gold- mounted Henry rifle from Wells Fargo, and Governor Frederick Low appointed Venard to his personal staff with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel for \\"meritorious services in the field\\".Bean, p. 18 According to Harper's Weekly, \\"No romance could depict greater bravery\\". The Henry Rifle hangs in the Wells Fargo Museum in San Francisco, CA In June 1866, Venard was appointed resident deputy sheriff at Meadow Lake City; here, he was appointed City Marshall and became a member of the Meadow Lake Yachting Club. By 1869, he was commissioned as a Deputy Sheriff. After being sent to Sonoma County in 1871 to investigate the Houx Gang, a group of Wells Fargo stage robbers, Venard played an important role in the capture of John Houx. After retiring from his career as a lawman due to advancing age and chronic rheumatism, Venard became a partner in the Detective Mine on Cement Hill in 1888. Personal life Venard was almost six feet tall. He had wavy black hair, and a full beard. Never married, he spent his leisure time reading books at the Library Association. Venard died of kidney failure in 1891 in Nevada City. Having died penniless, his friends paid for his burial at Nevada City's Pioneer Cemetery.

In the contemporary legal environment, it is a form of copyright infringement, which may be either a civil wrong or a crime depending on jurisdiction. The late 20th and early 21st centuries saw much controversy over the ethics of redistributing media content, how much production and distribution companies in the media were losing, and the very scope of what ought to be considered piracy ‚Äì and cases involving the piracy of music were among the most frequently discussed in the debate. History The name piracy is derived from its predecessor, pirate radio. In August 1906 The Copyright Law for Music Act 1906, known as the T.P. O'Connor Bill was passed by the British Parliament, following many of the popular music writers at the time dying in poverty due to extensive piracy by gangs during the piracy crisis of sheet music in the early 20th century.Atkinson, Benedict. & Fitzgerald, Brian. (eds.) (2017). Copyright Law: Volume II: Application to Creative Industries in the 20th Century. Routledge. p181.Dibble, Jeremy. (2002). Charles Villiers Stanford: Man and Musician Oxford University press. pp340-341. Sanjek, Russell. (1988). American Popular Music and Its Business: The First Four Hundred Years.

The film I'll Be Your Sweetheart (1945), commissioned by the British Ministry of Information, is based on the events of the day.Johns, Adrian. (2009). Piracy: The Intellectual Property Wars from Gutenberg to Gates. University of Chicago Press. p354. The invention of the Internet and digital media created music piracy in its modern form. With the invention of newer technology that allowed for the piracy process to become less complicated, it became much more common. Users of the web began adding media files to the internet, and prior potential risks and difficulties to pirating music, such as the physicality of the process, were eliminated. It was much easier for people with little to no knowledge of technology and old piracy methods to gather media files. The first application that demonstrated the implications of music piracy was Napster. Napster enabled users to exchange music files over a common free server without any regard for copyright laws. Napster was quickly shut down after lawsuits filed by Metallica and Dr. Dre and a separate lawsuit in regards to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Other music sharing services such as Limewire continued to be a resource to those searching for free music files. These platforms were also removed after a few years of service due to copyright laws and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. After finding some loopholes, piracy began to exist in more legal forms, an example being Pirate Bay. This technical legality was due to the format of the websites and their country of origin and administration. The websites were set up so that the site itself did not host any of the illegal files, but gave the user a map as to where they could access the files. Additionally, in Pirate Bay's case, the website was hosted under Swedish law, where this ‚Äúmap‚Äù was not illegal. Arguments over legality In face of the growing encroachment on potential sales from internet piracy, industry associations like the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) have lobbied for stricter laws and stricter punishment of those breaking copyright law. Record companies have also turned to technological barriers to copying, such as DRM, to some controversy. These organizations have tried to add more controls to the digital copy of the music to prevent consumers from copying the music. For the most part, the industry has come to a consensus that, if not DRM, then some similar measures are necessary for them to continue to make a profit. Critics of the record companies' strategy have proposed that the attempts to maintain sales rates are impeding the rights of legitimate listeners to use and listen to the music as they wish. When the US Congress passed the Copyright Act of 1909, it deliberately gave less copyright control to music composers than that of novelists: \\"Its fear was the monopoly power of rights holders, and that that power would stifle follow-on creativity\\". According to the internationally established Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, \\"Existing laws and regulations may be too broad and general to deal adequately with the rapid technological developments that facilitate digital piracy, and policy makers may need to consider enacting some specific provisions to deal with these infringements. Such provisions should not unduly impede legitimate digital communications, nor unreasonably impact on the Internet as an effective communications platform, commercial channel and educational tool...\\" There have been several means of free access to copyrighted music for the general public including Napster, Limewire, and Spotify. Napster was a free file sharing software created by college student Shawn Fanning to enable people to share and trade music files in mp3 format. Napster became hugely popular because it made it so easy to share and download music files. However, the heavy metal band Metallica sued the company for copyright infringement. This led to other artists following suit and shutting down Napster‚Äôs service. Likewise, Limewire was a free peer-to-peer file sharing software similar to that of Napster. The software enabled unlimited file sharing between computers and ended being one of the most popular sharing networks around. Like Napster, Limewire struggled through multiple legal battles and inevitably wound up being shut down. Spotify and other on-demand streaming services are offering a way for consumers to still get their music for free while also contributing to the musician in a small way instead of simply illegally downloading the music, but it also moves customers away from buying hard copies of music or even legally downloading songs which is severely reducing artists' income. According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) since Shawn Fanning started the program file sharing program Napster in 1999 music revenue has gone down 53% from $14.6 billion to $7.0 billion in 2013. A study done in 2007 by the Institute of Policy Innovation states that music piracy resulted in a loss of 71,060 U.S. jobs, out of which 23,860 would have been in the recording industry and 44,200 jobs in other unrelated industries.http://www.ipi.org/ipi_issues/detail/the-true-cost-of-sound- recording-piracy-to-the-us-economy Law enforcement The RIAA, a powerful lobby for the recording industry, is responsible for carrying out most of the lawsuits against music piracy in the United States. Some claim that the enforcement against music piracy, which may cost copyright violators up to $150,000 per infringement, is unreasonable, and that it may even violate United States constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment. Some have accused the RIAA of outright bullying, as when one of their lawyers told the defendant in one lawsuit, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to pay another visit to a dentist like me\\". In that same case, according to Lawrence Lessig, \\"the RIAA insisted it would not settle the case until it took every penny [the defendant] had saved\\". Further attempts at progress towards controlling the privacy of public media content by targeting the elimination of piracy were made when the highly anticipated yet often debated bill known as the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) was proposed nearly a dacade ago. The bill was first introduced in October 2011 by the United States House representative Lamar S. Smith. The general scope of the law was to fulfill the goal of putting a stop to online piracy by expanding upon existing criminal laws regarding copyright violations. The essential goal of the bill was to protect intellectual property of content creators by raising awareness of the severity of punishments for copyright infringement. Naturally, the bill was met with considerable opposition from various parties. One instance of this was an article comment by Edward J. Black, president and CEO of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, who questioned the potential effectiveness of the bill by reasoning that the major pirate websites that SOPA attempts to eliminate could just as easily respawn under a different name if taken down as early as a few hours later. Additionally, strong protest attempts were made across the internet when numerous high-profile online organizations including Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter, and participating in American Censorship Day on January 18, with some sites including Reddit and Wikipedia going as far as completely blacking out all of their pages, redirecting the user to SOPA protest messages. Ultimately, as a result of aggressive protests and lack of consenting opinions within the congress, SOPA was tabled on January 20 by its creator, House representative Lamar Smith. Economic ramifications Piracy's real effect on music sales is difficult to accurately assess. In neoclassical economics prices are determined by the combination of the forces of supply and demand, but the participators in the digital market do not always follow the usual motives and behaviors of the supply and demand system. First, the cost of digital distribution has decreased significantly from the costs of distribution by former methods. Furthermore, the majority of the filesharing community will distribute copies of music for a zero price in monetary terms, and there are some consumers who are willing to pay a certain price for legitimate copies even when they could just as easily obtain pirated copies, such as with pay what you want vendors. Another issue is that because many people in the world illegally download music because they cannot afford to purchase legitimate copies, not every illegal download necessarily equates to a lost sale. This has some effect on music sales, but as Lawrence Lessig points out, there is wide asymmetry between the estimated volume of illegal downloading and the projected loss of sales: According to Woolley's introduction each year It is estimated that 12.5 billion dollars are lost due to file sharing and music piracy, and 5 billion of that is profits lost from the music industry directly. Due to this dramatic loss in profits the music industry has been forced to cut down their staffing. Music piracy has become such an issue that the industry is encouraged to adapt to this new era and change.Woolley, D. J. (2010). The cynical pirate: how cynicism effects music piracy.

Surviving Music Piracy In A Digital Era\\" By Jelle Janssens, Stijn Vandaele, and Tom Vander Beken presents an analysis of the prevalence of piracy in music trade, which has affected the global sales of CDs. This article points out that technological development such as file sharing, MP3 players, and CDRs have increased music piracy. The most common forms of music piracy are Internet Piracy and compact disc piracy. It also discusses the association between music piracy and organized crime, which is defined as profit-driven illegal activities. The fact that digital products are virtual instead of physical affects the economic mechanisms behind the production and distribution of content, and how piracy works for digital as opposed to physical products: \\"the main consequence of the non-physical form of digital products is their virtually negligible marginal cost of reproduction and their ability to be digitally delivered.\\" The cost of burning a CD drastically lowered the overhead for record companies, as well as for music pirates, and with the growing tendency toward online distribution among legitimate and illicit distributors alike, the expense of distributing shrunk further from the costs of printing and transporting CDs to merely the costs of maintaining a website. By sheer volume of file transfers, though, distributing music through traditional web servers and FTP servers were not as popular as peer to peer (P2P) now, because the traditional direct download method is slower. The 2008 British Music Rights surveyAndrew Orlowski. 80% want legal P2P - survey. The Register, 2008. showed that 80% of people in Britain wanted a legal P2P service. This was consistent with the results of earlier research conducted in the United States, upon which the Open Music Model was based.Shuman Ghosemajumder. Advanced Peer-Based Technology Business Models. MIT Sloan School of Management, 2002. In addition, the majority of filesharers in the survey preferred to get their music from \\"local sources\\" such as LAN connections, email, flash drives, sharing with other people they know personally. The other most common method of filesharing was with P2P technologies. By 2007, P2P networks' popularity had grown so much that they used as much as 39% of the total volume of information exchanged over the internet. Rights Holders Solution Alongside the RIAA and BPI's industry anti-piracy service sit a number of other independent companies offering anti- piracy solutions. These companies tend to have a better reach and success rate than the slower industry bodies and provide an alternative solution. Notable market leaders include AudioLock, Web Sheriff, Topple Track, Detecnet, Muso and Attributor. Minimising Online Music Piracy There are ways to minimise music piracy on using the latest Google court decisions on the right to be forgotten as well as using some proven techniques relating to adding a watermark to the tracks and uploading the files yourself with promotional intent. A paper called the Music Anti-Piracy Best Practise Guidelines has been published by music anti-piracy specialists AudioLock and endorsed by the Association of Independent Music, the Association For Electronic Music (AFEM), music distributors Believe Digital and Judge Jules (DJ and Lawyer). These guidelines give advice on how to minimise exposure to music-piracy and how best to utilise the solutions that are available. Statistics have shown that since the early 2010s, there has been a decline in music piracy. According to a NPD survey, in 2012, approximately one in ten Internet users in the United States downloaded music through a file sharing service similar to BitTorrent or LimeWire. This number is significantly less than 2005, the peak of the piracy phenomenon, when one in five users used peer-to-peer networks to gather music files. The emergence of free streaming services has decreased the number of users who pirate music on the internet. Services such as Spotify and Pandora have easy-to-use interfaces and decrease the risk for computer viruses and spyware. In comparison to the illegal software used by older music piracy networks such as Napster or Limewire, current music streaming services such as Spotify and Rdio offer cheap yet legal access to copyrighted music by paying the rights holders through money made off of payments made by premium users and through advertisements See also * Music industry * Music copyright infringement in the People's Republic of China * Music download * Legal aspects of file sharing * Trade group efforts against file sharing * Anontune, a music site by Anonymous * File sharing * Activated Content * Indian Music Industry References 20th-century economic history 21st- century economic history Copyright infringement Piracy Intellectual property activism Media sharing ","title":"Music piracy"},{"id":"30098464","text":"Tasha Scott is an American actress and singer.

(ABFDE) is a non- profit organization which provides third-party certification of professional forensic document examiners (FDEs) from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States of America, and other countries places if approved by the Board of Directors. Sponsored by the American Academy of Forensic Sciences at its inception in 1977, the ABFDE is the largest certifying body of forensic document examiners in North America. Individuals holding a valid Certificate of Qualification issued by the ABFDE use the designation \\"Diplomate of the American Board of Forensic Document Examiners\\", often abbreviated as D-ABFDE. Objectives The Board states its objectives as \\"to establish, enhance, and maintain standards of qualification for those who practice forensic document examination and to certify, as qualified specialists, those voluntary applicants who comply with the requirements of the Board.\\" The ABFDE is intended to assist the judicial system and the public by providing \\"a practical and equitable system for readily identifying those persons professing to be specialists in forensic document examination who possess the requisite qualifications and competence\\". Courts must assess the credibility of the document examiner as an expert witness and to do this they will often rely upon the examiner's reputation in the profession, his or her affiliations with credible professional organizations or societies as well as any third- party certifications they may possess. The ABFDE is sponsored by the American Society of Questioned Document Examiners (ASQDE), Canadian Society of Forensic Science (CSFS), the Southeastern Association of Forensic Document Examiners (SAFDE), and the Southwestern Association of Forensic Document Examiners (SWAFDE) and further recognized by the American Academy of Forensic Sciences (AAFS), the International Association for Identification (IAI) and the Mid- Atlantic Association of Forensic Scientists (MAAFS). History The ABFDE is incorporated as a non-profit organization in the District of Columbia and was formed in 1977 under a grant from the U.S. Department of Justice. The ABFDE is accredited by the Forensic Specialties Accreditation Board, Inc. (FSAB) to carry out certification of FDEs. To date, there is no federal licensing involved in the discipline in North America. However, courts have recognized the ABFDE as reputable in the following cases, in denying a motion that claimed that handwriting comparisons were unreliable:  * John J. Harris sat as the inaugural chairman in 1977, and in the following year, the Committee of Certification was created. As of , 125 Diplomates are listed as being certified examiners working in private, federal, state and local government laboratories.

In addition to meeting the basic requirements listed above, an applicant must also pass comprehensive written, practical and oral examinations that test the wide range of problems encountered in document examination. Ongoing requirements for certification Certificates issued by the ABFDE are valid for five years, and can be renewed. During that five-year renewal period, the Diplomate must be actively engaged in forensic document examination work either as an examiner, as a supervisor of other forensic document examiners or as a trainer of forensic document examiners. Additionally, the Diplomate applying for recertification must earn at least 40 continuing education credits to demonstrate that s/he has maintained currency in the profession. Credits are awarded for a variety of related activities, such as attendance and participation at ABFDE approved forensic meeting and programs, and publication of articles in journals approved by the Board.

On one side of the conflict, the British and New England colonists were led by British Officer Charles Lawrence and New England Ranger John Gorham. On the other side, Father Jean- Louis Le Loutre led the Mi'kmaq and the Acadia militia in guerrilla warfare against settlers and British forces. (At the outbreak of the war there were an estimated 2500 Mi'kmaq and 12,000 Acadians in the region.) While the British captured Port Royal in 1710, the Mi'kmaq and Acadians continued to contain the British in settlements at Port Royal and Canso. The rest of the colony was in the control of the Catholic Mi'kmaq and Acadians. About forty years later, the British made a concerted effort to settle Protestants in the region and to establish military control over all of Nova Scotia and present-day New Brunswick, igniting armed response from Acadians in Father Le Loutre's War. The British settled 3,229 people in Halifax during the first years. This exceeded the number of Mi'kmaq in the entire region and was seen as a threat to the traditional occupiers of the land. The Mi'kmaq and some Acadians resisted the arrival of these Protestant settlers. The war caused unprecedented upheaval in the area. Atlantic Canada witnessed more population movements, more fortification construction, and more troop allocations than ever before. Twenty-four conflicts were recorded during the war (battles, raids, skirmishes), 13 of which were Mi'kmaq and Acadian raids on the capital region Halifax/Dartmouth. As typical of frontier warfare, many additional conflicts were unrecorded. During Father Le Loutre's War, the British attempted to establish firm control of the major Acadian settlements in peninsular Nova Scotia and to extend their control to the disputed territory of present-day New Brunswick. The British also wanted to establish Protestant communities in Nova Scotia. During the war, the Acadians and Mi'kmaq left Nova Scotia for the French colonies of Ile St. Jean (Prince Edward Island) and Ile Royale (Cape Breton Island). The French also tried to maintain control of the disputed territory of present-day New Brunswick. (Father Le Loutre tried to prevent the New Englanders from moving into present-day New Brunswick just as a generation earlier, during Father Rale's War, Rale had tried to prevent New Englanders from taking over present-day Maine.) Throughout the war, the Mi‚Äôkmaq and Acadians attacked the British forts in Nova Scotia and the newly established Protestant settlements. They wanted to retard British settlement and buy time for France to implement its Acadian resettlement scheme. The war began with the British establishing Halifax, settling more British settlers within six months than there were Mi'kmaq. In response, the Acadians and Mi'kmaq orchestrated attacks at Chignecto, Grand Pr√©, Dartmouth, Canso, Halifax and Country Harbour. The French erected forts at present-day Fort Menagoueche, Fort Beaus√©jour and Fort Gaspareaux. The British responded by attacking the Mi'kmaq and Acadians at Mirligueche (later known as Lunenburg), Chignecto and St. Croix. The British unilaterally established communities in Lunenburg and Lawrencetown. Finally, the British erected forts in Acadian communities located at Windsor, Grand Pr√© and Chignecto. The war ended after six years with the defeat of the Mi'kmaq, Acadians and French in the Battle of Fort Beaus√©jour. Background Acadian resistance to British-rule in Acadia began after Queen Anne's War, with the signing of the Treaty of Portsmouth in 1713. The treaty saw the French cede portions of New France to the British, including the Hudson Bay region, Newfoundland, and peninsular Acadia. Acadians had previously supported the French in three conflicts known as the French and Indian Wars. Acadians joined French privateer Pierre Maisonnat dit Baptiste as crew members in his victories over many British vessels during King William's War. After the Siege of Pemaquid, d'Iberville led a force of 124 Canadians, Acadians, Mi'kmaq and Abenaki in the Avalon Peninsula Campaign. They destroyed almost every British settlement in Newfoundland, killed more than 100 British and captured many more. They deported almost 500 British colonists to England or France. The evacuation of French forces from Port Royal. The French ceded the Acadian peninsula to the British after the siege of Port Royal in 1710. During Queen Anne's War, Mi‚Äôkmaq and Acadians resisted during the Raid on Grand Pr√©, Piziquid and Chignecto in 1704. The Acadians assisted the French in protecting the capital in the First siege of Port Royal and the final second siege of Port Royal. However, with the signing of the Treaty of Portsmouth in 1713, peninsular Acadia was formally ceded to the British. Although peace was formally reestablished with the French, the British still faced resistance from the French colonists in the Acadian peninsula. During Father Rale's War, the Maliseet raided numerous British vessels on the Bay of Fundy while the Mi'kmaq raided Canso, Nova Scotia in 1723. In the latter engagement, the Mi'kmaq were supported by the Acadians. During these conflicts, the French and Acadian settlers were aligned with the Mi‚Äôkmaq, fighting alongside them during the Battle of Bloody Creek The Mi'kmaq, which formed a part of the Wabanaki Confederacy, had a long history of protecting their land by killing British soldiers and civilians along the New England/Acadia border in Maine. During the 17th and early-18th century, the Wabanaki fought in several campaigns, including in 1688, 1703, 1723, 1724, 1745, 1746, and in 1747. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ Acadian, and Mi'kmaq militias fought alongside French forces during the Battle of Grand Pr√©, 1747. Hostilities between the British and French resumed during King George's War (1744‚Äì48). Supported by the French, Jean-Louis Le Loutre led a forces of French soldiers, and Acadians, and Mi‚Äôkmaq militiamen in efforts to recapture the capital, such as the Siege of Annapolis Royal. During this siege, the French officer Marin had taken British prisoners and stopped with them further up the bay at Cobequid. While at Cobequid, an Acadian said that the French soldiers should have \\"left their [the British] carcasses behind and brought their skins.\\" Le Loutre was also joined by the prominent Acadian resistance leader Joseph Broussard (Beausoleil). Broussard and other Acadians supported the French soldiers in the Battle of Grand Pr√©. During King George's War, Le Loutre, Gorham and Lawrence rose to prominence in the region. During the war, however, Massachusetts Governor Shirley acknowledged that Nova Scotia was still \\"scarcely\\" British and urged London to fund building forts in the Acadian communities. ‚Ä¢ The signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 ended formal hostilities between British and French forces. With peace formally reestablished, the British began to consolidate its control over peninsular Acadia, leading further conflict with the Acadian and Mi'kmaq. At the outset of Le Loutre's war, along with the New England Ranger units, there were three British regiments at Halifax, the 40th Regiment of Foot arrived from Annapolis, while the 29th Regiment of Foot and 45th Regiment of Foot arrived from Louisbourg. The 47th Regiment under the command of Peregrine Lascelles arrived the following year (1750). At sea, Captain John Rous was the senior naval officer on the Nova Scotia station during the war. The main officer under his command was Silvanus Cobb. John Gorham also owned two armed schooners: the Anson and the Warren. Course of war  1749  =British consolidation of Nova Scotia= Soldier of the 29th Regiment of Foot guarding Halifax against raids by Acadian and Mi'kmaq militia, 1749. Horsemans Fort stands in the background. The war began when Edward Cornwallis arrived to establish Halifax with 13 transports on June 21, 1749.; The British quickly began to build other settlements. To guard against Mi'kmaq, Acadian and French attacks on the new Protestant settlements, British fortifications were erected in Halifax (Citadel Hill in 1749), Bedford (Fort Sackville in 1749), Dartmouth (1750), Lunenburg (1753) and Lawrencetown (1754). Within 18 months of establishing Halifax, the British attempted to take control of the Nova Scotia peninsula by building fortifications in all the major Acadian communities: present-day Windsor (Fort Edward); Grand Pr√© (Fort Vieux Logis) and Chignecto (Fort Lawrence). A British fort (Fort Anne) already existed at the other major Acadian centre of Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia and Cobequid remained without a fort. Le Loutre is reported to have said that \\"the English might build as many Forts as they pleased but he wou'd take care that they shou'd not come out of them, for he was resolved to torment them with his Indians....\\" In fact, Mi'kmaq resistance kept the British largely holed up in their forts until the fall of Louisbourg (1758). Richard Bulkeley, the Lieutenant Governors of Nova Scotia noted that Nova Scotia \\"was kept in an uninterrupted state of war by the Acadians.\\" By June 1751, Cornwallis wrote to the Board of Trade that his adversaries had \\"done as much harm to as they could have done in open war.\\" Richard Bulkeley wrote that between 1749 and 1755, Nova Scotia \\"was kept in an uninterrupted state of war by the Acadians... and the reports of an officer commanding Fort Edward, [indicated he] could not be conveyed [to Halifax] with less an escort than an officer and thirty men.\\" (Along with Bulkeley, Cornwallis' other Aide-de-camp was Horatio Gates.) The only land route between Louisbourg and Quebec went from Baie Verte through Chignecto, along the Bay of Fundy and up the Saint John River. With the establishment of Halifax, the French recognized at once the threat it represented and that the Saint John River corridor might be used to attack Quebec City itself. To protect this vital gateway, at the beginning of 1749, the French strategically constructed three forts within 18 months along the route: one at Baie Verte (Fort Gaspareaux), one at Chignecto (Fort Beausejour) and another at the mouth of the Saint John River (Fort Menagoueche). In response to Gorham's raid on the St. John River in 1748, the Governor of Canada threatened to support native raids along the northern New England border. There were many previous raids from the Mi'kmaq militia and Maliseet Militias against British settlers on the border (1703, 1723, 1724, 1745, 1746, 1747). During the war, along the former border of Acadia, the Kennebec River, the British built Fort Halifax (Winslow), Fort Shirley (Dresden, formerly Frankfurt) and Fort Western (Augusta). = Acadian Exodus = Father Jean-Louis Le Loutre led the Acadian Exodus, an event that saw half of the Acadian population in the Acadian peninsula relocate to French- controlled territories further inland. With demands for an unconditional oath, the British fortification of Nova Scotia, and the support of French policy, a significant number of Acadians made a stand against the British. On 18 September 1749, a document was delivered to Edward Cornwallis signed by a total of 1000 Acadians, with representatives from all the major centres. The document stated that they would leave the country before they would sign an unconditional oath.; Cornwallis continued to press for the unconditional oath rejecting their Christian Catholic Faith and accepting the Protestant Anglican Church with a deadline of 25 October. In response, hundreds of Acadians were deported by the British with the confiscation of their homes, their lands and their cattle. The deportation of the Acadians by the British involved almost half of the total Acadian population of Nova Scotia. The expulsion was brutal often separating children from their families. The leader of the Exodus was Father Jean-Louis Le Loutre, whom the British gave the code name \\"Moses\\". Historian Micheline Johnson described Le Loutre as \\"the soul of the Acadian resistance.\\" =Conflict begins= The first military conflict of the war was at Canso, Nova Scotia. On 19 August 1749, Lieutenant Joseph Gorham, younger brother of John Gorham (military officer), was under the command of William Clapham at Canso, Nova Scotia and his party was attacked by Mi'kmaq.; Picheon, p. 278 They seized his vessel and took twenty prisoners and carried them off to Louisbourg ten days later on the 29th. After Cornwallis complained to the Governor of Ile Royale, sixteen of the prisoners were released to Halifax and the other four sent off on their own vessel.; The year earlier the Mi'kmaq had seized Captain Ellingwood's vessel Success and he promised them 100 pounds and left his son hostage to have it released. Mikmaq reported they released the prisoners from Canso. because Captain Ebenezer Ellingwood had paid the money but had not returned for his son. At the Isthmus of Chignecto in August 1749, the Mi'kmaq attacked two British vessels thought to be preventing Acadians from joining the Acadian Exodus by leaving Beaubassin for Ile St. Jean. On September 18, several Mi'kmaq and Maliseets ambushed and killed three British men at Chignecto. Seven natives were killed in the skirmish. ‚Ä¢ The Mi'kmaq saw the founding of Halifax without negotiation as a violation of earlier agreements with the British. On 24 September 1749, the Mi'kmaq formally wrote to Governor Cornwallis through Father Maillard, proclaiming their ownership of the land, and expressing their opposition to the British actions in settling at Halifax. Some historians have read this letter as declaration of hostility against the British. Other historians have questioned that interpretation. On September 30, 1749, about forty Mi'kmaq attacked six men during the Raid on Dartmouth. The six men, under the command of Major Gilman, were in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia cutting trees near a saw mill. Four of them were killed on the spot, one was taken prisoner and one escaped.; Two of the men were scalped and the heads of the others were cut off. Major Ezekiel Gilman and others in his party escaped and gave the alarm. A detachment of rangers was sent after the raiding party and cut off the heads of two Mi'kmaq and scalped one. This raid was the first of eight against Dartmouth during the war. This raid was consistent with the Wabanaki Confederacy and New England's approach to warfare with each other since King William's War (1688). =Cornwallis' proclamation= Edward Cornwallis, the Governor of Nova Scotia On October 1, 1749, Cornwallis convened a meeting of the Nova Scotia Council aboard HMS Beaufort. According to the minutes, in keeping with earlier treaties, the Council determined that they would treat the Mi'kmaq as rebellious British subjects rather than as war adversaries: \\"That, in their opinion to declare war formally against the Micmac Indians would be a manner to own them a free and independent people, whereas they ought to be treated as so many Banditti Ruffians, or Rebels, to His Majesty's Government.\\" On October 2, 1749, the Nova Scotia Council issued the extirpation proclamation against the Mi‚Äôkmaq on peninsular Nova Scotia and those that assist them. The intent of the proclamation was to stop native raids on the British and to pressure the natives into \\"submission\\" to establish \\"peace and friendship.\\" The proclamation outlined four strategies for people to pressure the natives: \\"annoy\\" them, \\"distress\\" them, kill them or take them prisoner. There was also a bounty of 10 guinea given for a native killed or taken prisoner. The proclamation reads: :\\"For, those cause we by and with the advice and consent of His Majesty's Council, do hereby authorize and command all Officers Civil and Military, and all His Majesty's Subjects or others to annoy, distress, take or destroy the Savage commonly called Micmac, wherever they are found, and all as such as aiding and assisting them, give further by and with the consent and advice of His Majesty's Council, do promise a reward of ten Guineas for every Indian Micmac taken or killed, to be paid upon producing such Savage taken or his scalp (as in the custom of America) if killed to the Officer Commanding.\\" To carry out this task, two companies of rangers were raised, one led by Captain Francis Bartelo and the other by Captain William Clapham. These two companies served alongside that of John Gorham's company. The three companies scoured the land around Halifax looking for Mi'kmaq. Three days after the bounty was ordered, on October 5, Governor Cornwallis sent Commander White with troops in the 20-gun sloop Sphinx to Mirligueche (Lunenburg).; After two consecutive attacks on June 18 and then June 20, 1750 Cornwallis deemed the initial proclamation ineffective and increased the bounty to 50 guinea on June 21, 1750. During Cornwallis' tenure there is evidence of one scalp being taken, no prisoners and three non-combatants being killed - three youth in 1752. = Siege of Grand Pr√© = Two months later, on November 27, 1749, 300 Mi'kmaq, Maliseet, and Acadians attacked Fort Vieux Logis, recently established by the British in the Acadian community of Grand Pr√©. The fort was under the command of Captain Handfield. The Native and Acadian militia killed the sentries (guards) who were firing on them. The Natives then captured Lieutenant John Hamilton and eighteen soldiers under his command, while surveying the fort's environs. After the British soldiers were captured, the native and Acadian militias made several attempts over the next week to lay siege to the fort before breaking off the engagement. Gorham's Rangers was sent to relieve the fort. When he arrived, the militia had already departed with the prisoners. The prisoners spent several years in captivity before being ransomed.; ; ; ; and There was no fighting over the winter months, which was common in frontier warfare.  1750‚Äì1751  = Battle at St. Croix = Fort Edward in 1753. In an effort to further consolidate control, John Gorham was dispatched to establish the blockhouse at Pisiquid. The following spring, on March 18, 1750, John Gorham and his Rangers left Fort Sackville (at present day Bedford, Nova Scotia), under orders from Governor Cornwallis, to march to Piziquid (present day Windsor, Nova Scotia). Gorham's mission was to establish a blockhouse at Pisiquid, which became Fort Edward, and to seize the property of Acadians who had participated in the siege of Grand Pr√©. Arriving at about noon on March 20 at the Acadian village of Five Houses beside the St. Croix River, Gorham and his men found all the houses deserted. Seeing a group of Mi‚Äôkmaq hiding in the bushes on the opposite shore, the Rangers opened fire. The skirmish deteriorated into a siege, with Gorham's men taking refuge in a sawmill and two of the houses. During the fighting, the Rangers suffered three wounded, including Gorham, who sustained a bullet in the thigh. As the fighting intensified, a request was sent back to Fort Sackville for reinforcements. Responding to the call for assistance on March 22, Governor Cornwallis ordered Captain Clapham's and Captain St. Loe's Regiments, equipped with two field guns, to join Gorham at Piziquid. The additional troops and artillery turned the tide for Gorham and forced the Mi‚Äôkmaq to withdraw. Gorham proceeded to present-day Windsor and forced Acadians to dismantle their church ‚Äì Notre Dame de l'Assomption ‚Äì so that Fort Edward could be built in its place. = Battles at Chignecto = In May 1750, Lawrence was unsuccessful in establishing himself at Chignecto because Le Loutre burned the village of Beaubassin, thereby preventing Lawrence from using the supplies of the village to establish a fort. (According to historian Frank Patterson, the Acadians at Cobequid burned their homes as they retreated from the British to Tatamagouche, Nova Scotia in 1754.) Lawrence retreated only to return in September 1750. On September 3, 1750 New England Ranger John Gorham led over 700 men to the Isthmus of Chignecto. Mi‚Äôkmaq and Acadians opposed the landing and killed twenty British. Several Mi‚Äôkmaq were killed and they were eventually overwhelmed by the invading force and withdrew, burning their crops and houses as they retreated. On 15 October (N.S.) a group of Micmacs disguised as French officers called a member of the Nova Scotia Council Edward How to a conference. This trap, organized by Chief √âtienne B√¢tard, gave him the opportunity to wound How seriously, and How died five or six days later, according to Captain La Valli√®re (probably Louis Leneuf de La Valli√®re), the only eyewitness. Fort Beausejour and the surrounding area, c. 1755. The French built fortifications around the Isthmus of Chignecto in an effort to limit British expansion into continental Acadia. Le Loutre and Acadian militia leader Joseph Broussard resisted the British assault. The British troops defeated the resistance and began construction of Fort Lawrence near the site of the ruined Acadian village of Beaubassin.Hand, p. 20 The work on the fort proceeded rapidly and the facility was completed within weeks. To limit the British to peninsular Nova Scotia, the French began also to fortify the Chignecto and its approaches, constructing Fort Beausejour and two satellite forts ‚Äì one at present-day Port Elgin, New Brunswick (Fort Gaspareaux) and the other at present-day Saint John, New Brunswick (Fort Menagoueche).Hand, p. 25 During these months, 35 Mi'kmaq and Acadians ambushed Ranger Francis Bartelo, killing him and six of his men while taking seven others captive. The captives' bloodcurdling screams as the Mi'kmaq tortured them throughout the night had a chilling effect on the New Englanders. = Raids on Halifax = There were four raids on Halifax during the war. The first raid happened in October 1750, while in the woods on peninsular Halifax, Mi'kmaq scalped two British people and took six prisoner: Cornwallis' gardener, his son, and Captain William Clapham's book keeper were tortured and scalped. The Mi'kmaq buried the son while the gardener's body was left behind and the other six persons were taken prisoner to Grand Pre for five months. Shortly after this raid, Cornwallis learned that the Mi'kmaq had received payment from the French at Chignecto for five prisoners taken at Halifax as well as prisoners taken earlier at Dartmouth and Grand Pre. In 1751, there were two attacks on blockhouses surrounding Halifax. Mi'kmaq attacked the North Blockhouse (located at the north end of Joseph Howe Drive) and killed the men on guard. Mi'kmaq also attacked near the South Blockhouse (located at the south end of Joseph Howe Drive), at a saw-mill on a stream flowing out of Chocolate Lake into the Northwest Arm. They killed two men. As cited in = Battle off Baie Verte = In August 1750, there was a naval battle off Baie Verte between British Captain Le Cras, of the Trial and the French sloop, London, of 70 tons. The London was seized to discover that it had been employed to carry stores of all kinds, arms, and ammunition, from Quebec to Le Loutre and the Mi'kmaq fighters. Fran√ßois Bigot, the intendant of New France had given instructions to the French captain to follow the orders of Le Loutre or La Corne, the bills of lading endorsed by Le Loutre, and other papers and letters, were found on board of her, with four deserters from Cornwallis' regiment, and a family of Acadians. The prize and her papers were sent to Halifax. = Port Joli = About 1750, the Mi'kmaq captured a New England fishing schooner off of Port Joli and tortured the crew members. To the west of St. Catherines River, the Mi'kmaq heated \\"Durham Rock\\" and forced each crew member to burn on the rock or jump to their death into the ocean. = Battle off Port La Tour (1750) = A historical marker for Fort Boishebert. Although British forces failed to intercept supplies heading to the fort in October 1750, Cornwallis gained further evidence that the French Governor General of the Canadas was providing the Mi'kmaq with weapons. In mid September 1750 French officer Louis Du Pont Duchambon de Vergor (later the commander at Fort Beausejour) was dispatched aboard the brigantine Saint-Fran√ßois to convoy the schooner Aimable Jeanne, which was carrying munitions and supplies from Quebec to the Saint John River for Boishebert at Fort Boishebert. Early on 16 October, about ten leagues west of Cape Sable (present-day Port La Tour, Nova Scotia and area), British Captain John Rous in HMS Albany overtook the French vessels.Pichon, p.280 Despite inferior armament, Vergor engaged the sloop, allowing Aimable Jeanne to reach Fort Boishebert. The action lasted the better part of the day, after which, with only seven men fit out of 50 and Saint- Fran√ßois unmasted and sinking, Vergor was obliged to yield. Three of Rous' crew were killed. The French ship contained a large quantity of provision, uniforms and warlike supplies. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ Cornwallis noted that this action was the second time he had caught the Governor of Canada sending a ship of military supplies to the Mi'kmaq to use against the British. By the end of the year, Cornwallis estimated that there were no less than eight to ten French vessels which unloaded war supplies for the Mi'kmaq, French, and Acadians at Saint John River and Baye Vert. In response to their defeat in the Battle off Port La Tour, the Governor of Canada ordered four British sloops to be seized at Louisbourg. = Raids on Dartmouth = There were six raids on Dartmouth during this time period. In July 1750, the Mi'kmaq killed and scalped 7 men who were at work in Dartmouth. In August 1750, 353 people arrived on the Alderney and began the town of Dartmouth. The town was laid out in the autumn of that year.Akins, p. 27 The following month, on September 30, 1750, Dartmouth was attacked again by the Mi'kmaq and five more residents were killed. In October 1750 a group of about eight men went out \\"to take their diversion; and as they were fowling, they were attacked by the Indians, who took the whole prisoners; scalped ... [one] with a large knife, which they wear for that purpose, and threw him into the sea ...\\" The following spring, on March 26, 1751, the Mi'kmaq attacked again, killing fifteen settlers and wounding seven, three of which would later die of their wounds. They took six captives, and the regulars who pursued the Mi'kmaq fell into an ambush in which they lost a sergeant killed. Two days later, on March 28, 1751, Mi'kmaq abducted another three settlers. Old Burying Ground, in Halifax. British victims from the conflict were occasionally buried here, including the victims from the Dartmouth raids. Two months later, on May 13, 1751, Broussard led sixty Mi'kmaq and Acadians to attack Dartmouth again, in what would be known as the \\"Dartmouth Massacre\\". Broussard and the others killed twenty settlers ‚Äì mutilating men, women, children and babies ‚Äì and took more prisoners. A sergeant was also killed and his body mutilated. They destroyed the buildings. The British returned to Halifax with the scalp of one Mi'kmaq warrior, however, they reported that they killed six Mi'kmaq warriors. Captain William Clapham and sixty soldiers were on duty and fired from the blockhouse. The British killed six Mi'kmaq warriors, but were only able to retrieve one scalp that they took to Halifax. Those at a camp at Dartmouth Cove, led by John Wisdom, assisted the settlers. Upon returning to their camp the next day they found the Mi'kmaq had also raided their camp and taken a prisoner. All the settlers were scalped by the Mi'kmaq. The British took what remained of the bodies to Halifax for burial in the Old Burying Ground.; = Raid on Chignecto = The British retaliated for the raid on Dartmouth by sending several armed companies to Chignecto. A few French defenders were killed and the dikes were breached. Hundreds of acres of crops were ruined which was disastrous for the Acadians and the French troops. In the summer of 1752 Father Le Loutre went to Quebec and then on to France to advocate for supplies to re-build the dikes. He returned in the spring of 1753.  1752‚Äì1753  In 1752, the Mi'kmaq attacks on the British along the coast, both east and west of Halifax, were frequent. Those who were engaged in the fisheries were compelled to stay on land because they were the primary targets. In early July, New Englanders killed and scalped two Mi'kmaq girls and one boy off the coast ofBookmarks Cape Sable (Port La Tour, Nova Scotia). In August, at St. Peter's, Nova Scotia, Mi'kmaq seized two schooners ‚Äì the Friendship from Halifax and the Dolphin from New England ‚Äì along with 21 prisoners who were captured and ransomed. By the summer of 1752, the war had not been going well for the British. The Acadian Exodus remained strong. The war had bankrupted the colony. As well, two of the three ranger leaders had died. In August 1751, the main ranger leader John Gorham left for London and died there of disease in December. Ranger leader Captain Francis Bartelo had been killed in action at Chignecto, while the other ranger leader Captain William Clapham had been disgraced, failing to prevent the Dartmouth Massacre. John Gorham was succeeded by his younger brother Joseph Gorham. In 1752, to reduce the expense of the war, the companies raised in 1749 were disbanded, bringing down the strength of the unit to only one company. This reduction led to the 22 March 1753 resolution for a militia that would be raised from the colonists to establish the security of the colony, in which all British subjects between the ages of 16 and 60 were compelled to serve. On April 21, 1753, at Torbay, the Mi'kmaq fighters killed two British.Section 3. No names for deaths. Deaths, Burials and Probate of Nova Scotians 1749‚Äì1799 Throughout 1753, French authorities on Cape Breton Island were paying Mi'kmaq warriors for the scalps of the British. In June 1753, the London Magazine reported that \\"the war with the Indians hath hitherto hindered the inhabitants going far into the woods.\\" On 14 September 1752 Governor Peregrine Hopson and the Nova Scotia Council negotiated the Treaty of 1752 with Jean-Baptiste Cope. (The treaty was signed officially on November 22, 1752.) Cope was unsuccessful in getting support for the treaty from other Mi'kmaq leaders. Cope burned the treaty six months after he signed it.Plank, 1996, p.33-34 Despite the collapse of peace on the eastern shore, the British did not formally renounce the Treaty of 1752 until 1756. = Attack at Mocodome = On February 21, 1753, nine Mi'kmaq from Nartigouneche (present-day Antigonish, Nova Scotia) in canoes attacked a British vessel at Country Harbour, Nova Scotia. The vessel was from Canso and had a crew of four. The Mi'kmaq fired on them and drove them toward the shore. Other natives joined in and boarded the schooner, forcing them to run their vessel into an inlet. The Mi'kmaq killed and scalped two of the British and took two others captive. After seven weeks in captivity, on April 8, the two British prisoners ‚Äì one of which was John Connor ‚Äì killed six Mi'kmaq and managed to escape. The Mi'kmaq account of this attack was that the two English died of natural causes and the other two killed seven of the Mi'kmaq for their scalps. = Attack at Jeddore = In response, on the night of April 21, under the leadership of Chief Jean- Baptiste Cope and the Mi'kmaq attacked another British schooner in a battle at sea off Jeddore, Nova Scotia. On board were nine British men and one Acadian (Casteel), who was the pilot. The Mi'kmaq killed and scalped the British and let the Acadian off at Port Toulouse, where the Mi'kmaq sank the schooner after looting it.; In August 1752, the Mi'kmaq at Saint Peter's seized the schooners Friendship of Halifax and Dolphin of New England and took 21 prisoners who they held for ransom. In May 1753, natives scalped two British soldiers at Fort Lawrence.; = Raid on Halifax = View of Halifax, c. 1749. Although the settlement was protected by palisades, areas outside the city walls were subject to raids. In late September 1752, Mi‚Äôkmaq scalped a man they had caught outside the palisade of Fort Sackvillle.Halifax Gazette, September 30, 1752 In 1753, when Lawrence became governor, the Mi'kmaq attacked again upon the sawmills near the South Blockhouse on the Northwest Arm, where they killed three British. The Mi'kmaq made three attempts to retrieve the bodies for their scalps. On the otherside of the harbour in Dartmouth, in 1753, there were reported only to be five families, all of whom refused to farm for fear of being attacked if they left the confines of the picketed fence around the village. On 23 July 1753, Governor Hobson reported to the Board of Trade on the \\"continual war we have with the Indians.\\" Governor Hobson in his letter to the Board of Trade, dated 1 October 1753, says, \\"At Dartmouth there is a small town well picketed in, and a detachment of troops to protect it, but there are not above five families residing in it, as there is no trade or fishing to maintain any inhabitants, and they apprehend danger from the Indians in cultivating any land on the outer side of the pickets.\\" = The Lunenburg Rebellion = In the spring of 1753, it became public knowledge that the British were planning to unilaterally establish the settlement of Lunenburg, that is, without negotiating with the Mi'kmaq people. The British decision was a continuation of violations of an earlier treaty and undermined Chief Jean-Baptiste Cope's 1752 Peace Treaty. As a result, Governor Peregrine Hopson received warnings from Fort Edward that as many as 300 natives nearby were prepared to oppose the settlement of Lunenburg and intended to attack upon the arrival of settlers. The move was part of the British government campaign to establish Protestants in Nova Scotia against the power of Catholic Acadians. In June 1753, 1400 German and French Protestant settlers, supervised by Lawrence and protected by the British Navy ships, a unit of Regular soldiers under Major Patrick Sutherland, and a unit of rangers under Joseph Gorham, established the village of Lunenberg.; The settlement was founded by two British army officers John Creighton and Patrick Sutherland and German-immigrant local official Dettlieb Christopher Jessen. In August 1753, Le Loutre paid Mi'kmaq for 18 British scalps which they took from the English in different incursions that they had made on their establishments over the summer. In December 1753, the British dispatched Robert Monckton to quell the Hoffman Insurrection. The British feared the French, and German Protestant rebels might have joined the Acadians. In mid December 1753, within six months of their arrival at Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, the new settlers, supported by Le Loutre, rebelled against the British. The rebellion is often referred to as \\"The Hoffman Insurrection,\\" because it was led by John Hoffman, one of the army captains who had established the settlers in the town. Hoffman led a mob that eventually locked up in one of the blockhouses the Justice of the Peace and some of Commander Patrick Sutherland's troops. The rebels then declared a republic. Commander Patrick Sutherland at Lunenburg asked for reinforcements from Halifax and Lawrence sent Colonel Robert Monckton with troops to restore order. Monckton arrested Hoffman and took him to Halifax. Hoffman was charged with planning to join the French and take a large number of settlers with him. He was fined and imprisoned on Georges Island (Nova Scotia) for two years. After the rebellion a number of the French and German- speaking Foreign Protestants left the village to join Le Loutre and the Acadians.Charles Morris. 1762. British Library, Manuscripts, Kings 205: Report of the State of the American Colonies. pp: 329‚Äì330; ‚Ä¢ Lawrence and his deputy refused to send Acadians to the area for fear of their influence on the local population. = Dyking on riviere Au Lac = Le Loutre and the Acadian refugees at Chignecto struggled to create dykes that would support the new communities that resulted from the Acadian Exodus. In the first winter (1749), the Acadians survived on rations waiting for the dykes to be built. Acadians from Minas were a constant support in providing provisions and labour on the dykes. In retaliation for the Acadian and Mi‚Äôkmaq Raid on Dartmouth (1751), the British raided Chignecto destroying the dykes and ruining hundreds of acres of crops. Acadians began to defect from the exodus and made application to return to the British colony. Le Loutre immediately sought help from Quebec and then France to support re-building dykes in the area. He returned with success in May 1753 and work began on the grand dyking project on riviere Au Lac (present day Aulac River, New Brunswick). At this time, there were 2000 Acadians and about 300 Mi'kmaq encamped near-by. By the summer of 1754, Le Loutre's amazing engineering feats manifested themselves on the great sweeping marshlands of the isthmus; he now had in his workforce and within a forty-eight-hour marching radius about 1400 to 1500 Acadian men. Nearby at Baie Verte there was a summer encampment of about 400 natives that would have been one of the largest concentrations of Native people in the Atlantic region at the time. Altogether, he had a substantial fighting force capable of defending itself against anything the Nova Scotia Government might have mustered at the time. Unfortunately, that year storm tides broke through the main cross-dike of the large-scale reclamation project, destroying nearly everything the Acadians had accomplished in several months of intense work. Again some Acadians tried to defect to the British.  1754‚Äì1755  = Raid on Lawrencetown = In 1754, the British unilaterally established Lawrencetown. In late April 1754, Beausoleil and a large band of Mi'kmaq and Acadians left Chignecto for Lawrencetown. They arrived in mid-May and in the night open fired on the village. Beausoleil killed and scalped four British settlers and two soldiers. By August, as the raids continued, the residents and soldiers were withdrawn to Halifax. By June 1757, the settlers had to be withdrawn completely again from the settlement of Lawrencetown because the number of Native raids eventually prevented settlers from leaving their houses. Prominent Halifax business person Michael Francklin was captured by a Mi'kmaq raiding party in 1754 and held captive for three months. Another captivity narrative was written by Henry Grace was taken captive by the Mi'kmaq near Fort Cumberland in the early 1750s. The narrative was entitled, \\"The History of the Life and Sufferings of Henry Grace\\" (Boston, 1764). = Port Joli = In 1754, late one evening, a canoe full of Mi'kmaq fighters attempted to destroy the rudder of a New England fishing vessel. The New England crew sank the canoe and all the Mi'kmaq drowned except Molly Pigtow who was captured and taken back to New England. = Battle off Port La Tour (1755) = resumption of formal war between the British and French. In April 1755, while searching for a wrecked vessel at Port La Tour, Cobb discovered the French schooner Marguerite (Margarett), taking war supplies to the Saint John River for Boishebert at Fort Menagoueche. Cobb returned to Halifax with the news and was ordered by Governor Charles Lawrence to blockade the harbour until Captain William Kensey arrived in the warship , and then to assist Kensey in capturing the French prize and taking it to Halifax. In the Action of 8 June 1755, a naval battle off Cape Race, Newfoundland, the British found on board the French ships Alcide and Lys 10,000 scalping knives for Acadians and Indians serving under Mi'kmaq Chief Cope and Acadian Beausoleil as they continued to fight Father Le Loutre's War. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ The British also thwarted French supplies from reaching Acadians and Mi'kmaq resisting the British in the previous war, King George's War‚Äîsee First Battle of Cape Finisterre (1747). = Battle of Fort Beaus√©jour = On May 22, 1755, the British commanded a fleet of three warships and thirty-three transports carrying 2,100 soldiers from Boston, Massachusetts; they landed at Fort Lawrence on June 3, 1755. The following day the British forces attacked Fort Beausejour using the plan created by spy Thomas Pichon. After the Fort's capitulation the French forces evacuated on June 16, 1755 to Fort Gaspereaux en route to Louisbourg, arriving on June 24, 1755. Shortly after, Monckton dispatched Captain John Rous to take Fort Menagoueche at the mouth of the St. John River. Boishebert, seeing that resistance was futile, destroyed the fort and retreated upriver to Belleisle Bay. There he erected a camp volant and constructed a small battery as a rear guard for the Acadian settlements on the river. which the French destroyed themselves to prevent it from falling into British hands. This battle proved to be one of the key victories for the British in the Seven Years' War, in which Great Britain gained control of nearly all of New France.Hand, p. 102  Trade during the war  During Father Le Loutre's War, Minas Basin communities willingly responded to the call from Le Loutre for basic food stuffs. The bread basket of the region, they raised wheat and other grains, produced flour in no fewer than eleven mills, and sustained herds of several thousand head of cattle, sheep and hogs. Regular cattle droves made their way over a road from Cobequid to Tatamagouche for the supply of Beausejour, Louisbourg, and settlements on Ile St. Jean. Other exports went by sea from Minas Basin to Beaubassin or to the mouth of the St. John River, carried in Acadian vessels by Acadian middlemen. At the same time, Acadians began to refuse to trade with the British. By 1754, no Acadian produce was reaching the Halifax market. While the French pressured Acadians not to trade with Halifax, even when British merchants tried to buy directly from Acadians, they were refused. Acadians refused to supply Fort Edward with any firewood. Lawrence passed a Corn Law, forbidding Acadian exports until Halifax market had been supplied. The British devised a war plan for Nova Scotia that focused on cutting off the food supply to Fort Beaus√©jour and Louisbourg. This plan involved both siege tactics but also cutting of the source of the supply.;  Aftermath  deportation of Acadian settlers in Grand-Pr√©. Father Le Loutre's War had done much to create the condition of total war; British civilians had not been spared, and, as Lawrence saw it, Acadian civilians had provided intelligence, sanctuary, and logistical support while others actually fought in armed conflict. More than any other single factor ‚Äì including the massive assault that eventually forced the surrender of Louisbourg ‚Äì the supply problem spelled doom to French power in the region. To cut off the supply to the French, Lawrence realized he could do this, in part, by deporting the Acadians. With the fall of Beausejour, Le Loutre was imprisoned and the Acadian expulsion began. During the French and Indian War, the British forces rounded up French settlers starting with the Bay of Fundy Campaign (1755). The British deported the Acadians and burned their villages at Chignecto to prevent their return. The Acadian Exodus from Nova Scotia during the war spared most of those who joined it ‚Äì particularly those who went to Ile St. Jean and Ile Royal ‚Äì from the British expulsion of the Acadians in 1755. However, with the fall of Louisbourg in 1758, the Acadians who left for the French colonies were deported as well.

Life and career Early years Hallwachs was born in 1859 in Darmstadt to Ludwig and Emilie Hallwachs. His father was a high ranking public official (Geheimer Staatsrat) with the Ministry of the Interior and Justice of the Grand Duchy of Hesse, then part of the German Confederation. Career From 1878 Hallwachs studied physics, most of his time at the University of Strasbourg, then part of Germany he also did one year at the University of Berlin. At last he was an assistant to August Kundt at Strasbourg where he was awarded a doctorate in 1893. Hallwachs moved on to become an assistant to Friedrich Kohlrausch at the University of W√ºrzburg where he stayed there from 1884 until 1886. In 1886, he went to Leipzig where he habilitated with Gustav Heinrich Wiedemann until 1888. After that he followed Friedrich Kohlrausch in Strasbourg. Hallwachs became a professor at the Dresden University of Technology in 1893, originally for electrical engineering until he succeeded August Toepler in 1900 as a professor for physics. In 1921/22 Hallwachs was rector of the university. Private life In 1890 Hallwachs married Marie Kohlrausch, the daughter of Professor Friedrich Kohlrausch (physicist); he was an assistant with her in W√ºrzburg. Scientific work Hallwachs was a known as a builder of scientific instruments. Among the devices he invented are the electrometer quadrant and a double refractometer of great precision. Hallwachs was an assistant of Heinrich Hertz, in 1886, before the photoelectric effect was discovered. Hallwachs and Hertz, in 1887, carried on the investigations of electromagnetic waves. In 1888 Hallwachs formulated the hypothesis that a conductive plate on which to focus ultraviolet light carries a positive charge because the electrons are gouged out. This happened with more intensity in selenium. The phenomenon was seen in the same year by A. Righi. The phenomenon was called 'Hallwachs-Effekt', now called the photoelectric effect. The investigation of the photoelectric effect laid the foundation for the development of the photoelectric cell, photo electricity and Albert Einstein's quantum light hypothesis.

Eakins knew Williams through her father, Henry Williams, and she had posed for several of Eakins's paintings.

Morgan was impressed with her profile, stating that it was the most perfect he had seen in England or America. The silver dollar bearing her likeness was first struck on March 11, 1878. A condition of her sitting for Morgan was that her identity be kept secret, but the subject of the portrait was revealed to be Williams shortly after the dollar was released.

It was designed by Benjamin Joseph Backhouse and built from 1863 to 1865 by CA Doran. It is also known as St Mary of the Assumption Church and St Mary's Church. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  ca. 1865 School with the church in background, ca. 1886 The first Saint Mary's Church, Warwick is a substantial sandstone building, constructed 1863‚Äì1865 to designs of prominent Brisbane architect, Benjamin Backhouse. From the 1840s, it seems that informal Roman Catholic services were held in Warwick by visiting priests from Sydney, Ipswich and Brisbane. The first recorded mass was held in 1854 by Rev. Father McGinty who travelled from Ipswich, and this was celebrated at the Horse and Jockey Inn, Palmerin Street, where services for most other denominations were held at this time. In 1862 Warwick became a separate parish of the church, only one year after the Borough of Warwick was declared a municipality on 25 May 1861. The first priest was Dr John Cani (who became the first Bishop of Rockhampton in 1882). By 20 August 1863, discussions were being held for the erection of a church in Palmerin Street, the main street of Warwick. was needed for the purchase of land and was subscribed on that day. Various people, including Michael Knole, William Cowper and Sarah Ransley acquired the various future church lots (Allotments 7-12 of Section 49) by Deed of Grant on 16 August 1860. By September 1863, John Cani and James Quinn, the parish priest and Bishop of Brisbane respectively, became the registered owners of these allotments. The plan for the church was duly prepared by prominent Brisbane architect, Benjamin Backhouse, to the specifications that it was to be simple but tasteful, in the Gothic style and in stone or brick. Benjamin Joseph Backhouse arrived in Brisbane in May 1861, and designed many buildings of architectural pretension in Queensland over the next six years, before he departed for New South Wales by 1868. He was responsible for the design of many churches including the second St Stephen's Roman Catholic Cathedral in Brisbane, additions to St John's Pro-Cathedral in Brisbane, as well as many other smaller regional churches. Despite the setback of severe damage during a thunder storm the church the building was officially opened on 23 August 1865 by Bishop Quinn, the first Roman Catholic Bishop of Brisbane. At this time the church was named the St Mary of the Assumption, now popularly shortened to St Mary's. This original building consisted of only the nave of the present church, with side entrances, not through porches, but simply accessing the body of the church directly. The roof of the building was slated or shingled. The contractor was CA Doran and the structure cost about . The stone for the construction of the church was obtained from the Sidling Quarries, which were a small group of quarries in Warwick. In 1865 Dr Cani was succeeded by Father Scortechini, who was soon after replaced by Father Hogan. By 1867 a Catholic school, run by the Misses O'Mara until the arrival of the Sisters of Mercy in 1874, was established in the church by the next parish priest, Father O'Reilly. The church was partitioned with calico screens, firstly to separate the sanctuary from the teaching area and, later to divide the teaching area into smaller rooms in the body of the church. O'Reilly was replaced by Father McDonagh, who was the first resident priest, and after him in 1876 came Father James Horan who was to remain in Warwick until 1905. Horan was responsible for the completion of the church by 1894, when the transepts and chancel were added. By this time porches over the side entrances were also completed. Monsignor Michael Potter was posted as a curate to Warwick in 1891, and continued there as the parish priest after Horan's death in 1905. It was Potter who decided that the original St Mary's Church was no longer adequate for the needs of his community. Thus he sought plans for the construction of a second larger church, further north on the same block in Palmerin Street. Local architects, Dornbusch and Connolly drew plans for the second St Mary's church which, like the original church, was to conform to a cruciform plan, but only the body has thus far been completed. The new church was constructed between 1920 and 1926, when it was officially opened. After the opening of the new church, the original St Mary's was partitioned, lined and used as school rooms, for the Catholic primary school which began in the building in its earliest days. It has remained as a community meeting hall and store to this day.  Description  The former St Mary's Church is situated within the school grounds of the local Catholic primary school in Palmerin Street, Warwick. The church is of solid sandstone construction, and conforms to a cruciform plan, with nave extending to the east, transepts to the north and south and chancel to the west. The sandstone, which is finely tooled, is generally coursed, with larger blocks used as quoining. The church sits on a plinth, formed by a course of sandstone projecting slightly from the face of the walls. The corrugated iron roof is gabled and has overhanging eaves lined with wide timber beaded boarding which returns to the interior of the space. The eastern entrance facade features a small gabled entrance porch, with a pointed arched opening formed with smooth-faced sandstone blocks. Buttressing is formed by extensions of the faces of both the porch and main body of the church, this detail is repeated on the transepts and western end of the building. Above the porch is a rose window, of heavy tracery, with some early glass panels; above this is a ventilation opening in the form of a Latin Cross. Surmounting the apex of the gable is a carved stone Latin Cross. The north and south, transverse elevation feature projecting side entrances and transepts, among regularly spaced single lancet window openings. The entrances from the sides of the church, feature pointed arched doorways on the eastern face, and single window openings of plate tracery, with small quatrefoil opening above. The transepts feature large rose windows in the gables. The western, chancel, face of the church features a large geometric tracery opening, incorporating four lancet openings, two quatrefoils and a rose feature above. Internally, the building retains very little of its ecclesiastical character, with the exception of the window openings. The walls are rendered, the floor carpeted and a ceiling of fibrous sheeting has been inserted. The space is divided into several smaller spaces with v-j boarding. The sandstone of church suffers from rising damp problems.  Heritage listing  The first St Mary's Church was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The church is important in demonstrating the growth of Warwick during the 1860s when the town became the centre of an agricultural region. The church is able to demonstrate the spread of the catholic church through regional areas where substantial buildings were erected in the mid nineteenth century. The former St Mary's church is associated with the early prominent Brisbane architect, Benjamin Backhouse. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The former St Mary's Church is rare as one of the earliest extant sandstone buildings in Warwick, and the earliest sandstone church. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building is a good example of masonry church design of mid nineteenth century Queensland, influenced by the English revival of early Gothic architecture. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It is a well composed and constructed stone building, with fine stone tracery. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The building has special associations with the Roman Catholic community in Warwick, as a former parish church and as the central focus of the catholic primary school since its construction in 1863-5.

It is associated with LRP2. It is an inherited (genetic) disorder that affects many parts of the body. Presentation This disorder is characterized by unusual facial features, including prominent, wide-set eyes with outer corners that point downward; a short bulbous nose with a flat nasal bridge; ears that are rotated backward; and a widow's peak hairline. Individuals with Donnai‚ÄìBarrow syndrome have severe hearing loss caused by abnormalities of the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss). In addition, they often experience vision problems, including extreme nearsightedness (high myopia), detachment or deterioration of the light- sensitive tissue in the back of the eye (the retina), and progressive vision loss. Some have a gap or split in the colored part of the eye (iris coloboma). In almost all people with Donnai‚ÄìBarrow syndrome, the tissue connecting the left and right halves of the brain (corpus callosum) is underdeveloped or absent. Affected individuals may also have other structural abnormalities of the brain. They generally have mild to moderate intellectual disability and developmental delay. People with Donnai‚ÄìBarrow syndrome may also have a hole in the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm), which is called a diaphragmatic hernia. This potentially serious birth defect allows the stomach and intestines to move into the chest and possibly crowd the developing heart and lungs. An opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the navel may also occur in affected individuals. Occasionally people with Donnai‚ÄìBarrow syndrome have abnormalities of the intestine, heart, or other organs and scoliosis. Causes Mutations in the LRP2 gene cause Donnai‚ÄìBarrow syndrome. The LRP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called megalin, which functions as a receptor. Receptor proteins have specific sites into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. Together, ligands and their receptors trigger signals that affect cell development and function. Megalin has many ligands involved in various body processes, including the absorption of vitamins A and D, immune functioning, stress response, and the transport of fats in the bloodstream. Megalin is embedded in the membrane of cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the body (epithelial cells). The receptor helps move its ligands from the cell surface into the cell (endocytosis). It is active in the development and function of many parts of the body, including the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), eyes, ears, lungs, intestine, reproductive system, and the small tubes in the kidneys where urine is formed (renal tubules). LRP2 gene mutations that cause Donnai‚ÄìBarrow syndrome are believed to result in the absence of functional megalin protein. The lack of functional megalin in the renal tubules causes megalin's various ligands to be excreted in the urine rather than being absorbed back into the bloodstream. The features of Donnai‚ÄìBarrow syndrome are probably caused by the inability of megalin to help absorb these ligands, disruption of biochemical signaling pathways, or other effects of the nonfunctional megalin protein. However, it is unclear how these abnormalities result in the specific signs and symptoms of the disorder. A condition previously classified as a separate disorder called facio-oculo-acoustico-renal (FOAR) syndrome has also been found to be caused by LRP2 mutations. FOAR syndrome is now considered to be the same disorder as Donnai‚ÄìBarrow syndrome. Inherited mutation This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. In almost all cases, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene but typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. This article incorporates text from the United States National Library of Medicine, which is in the public domain.The sources below were used to develop this article's condition summary on Donnai-Barrow syndrome.   One individual with Donnai‚ÄìBarrow syndrome was found to have inherited both copies of the mutated gene from his father as a result of a genetic change called uniparental disomy (UPD). UPD occurs when a person receives two copies of a chromosome, or part of a chromosome, from one parent and no copies from the other parent. UPD can occur as a random event during the formation of egg or sperm cells or may happen in early fetal development. Diagnosis Management Epidemiology Donnai‚ÄìBarrow syndrome appears to be a rare disorder. A few dozen affected individuals have been reported in many regions of the world.

He was among the engineers who surrendered to the United States and traveled there, providing rocketry expertise via Operation Paperclip, which took them first to Fort Bliss, Texas. Grau was sent by the U.S. Army to White Sands in 1946 to work on the assemblage (with parts shipped from Germany) and testing of the V-2. His wife joined him there in 1947 (Grau's son was born in Texas in 1949). While von Braun was on standby at Fort Bliss, Grau and other German aerospace engineers busily launched V-2s for U.S. scientists to analyze. A total of 67 V-2s were launched at White Sands. He continued his work with the team when they moved to the Redstone Arsenal (Alabama), and then joined the Marshall Space Flight Center to work for NASA in 1950. Grau served as the director of quality in all of those assignments, including the Saturn V program which took mankind to the moon. Grau said that von Braun worked closely with then-Colonel Holger Toftoy to develop the kind of team he wanted in the U.S. \\"One of my main jobs at that time was to get information to the scientists and see what kind of projects they would like to have and then, of course, we had to accommodate them,\\" Grau recalled. \\"Even though we were busy, we were more used to much overtime. But that was not the case (at White Sands). There we had a normal workday.\\" Saturn-rocket configurations in 1961. Things changed with their arrival in Huntsville. In many ways the Germans felt like they were coming home. Gone were the dry, desert conditions of Fort Bliss and White Sands, replaced with a green, mountainous agricultural area reminiscent of Germany. Grau noted: : \\"Coming to Huntsville was our coming back to the green country. We were used to green country and out there at Fort Bliss and White Sands there was just desert. We liked this so much better. This was more the landscape we were used to. For us, it was kind of a relief to come to the green country.\\" \\"The new Redstone rocket had to go somewhat further. It had to be bigger and it had to be made with American parts,\\" Grau said. : \\"Industry came in and worked with us to build and develop new stuff. The engine had to be redesigned. It had to be bigger. At that time, industry came really onboard.\\" Grau, along with von Braun's team, moved from the Army to NASA to develop the first rockets designed expressly for exploration. Grau oversaw quality assurance for the development of the Saturn I and Saturn V rockets. Ed Buckbee, formerly of MSFC public affairs, said of this time, \\"When Dieter spoke, everybody in the room listened.\\" \\"We had wonderful experiences going into space. We had wonderful cooperation to accomplish something never done before,\\" Grau said. : \\"See how well it all worked out? We had no idea how things would work out. We took a tremendous risk to come here. We never thought we would be able to stay so long. I have real good fortune that I have had a fulfilled life and I remember so much.\\" Grau died in Huntsville, Alabama, at the age of 101 on December 17, 2014.

Berdavan Castle is above sea level.Berdavan Castle Altitude and Position  History  Berdavan is thought to have originally been built between the 10th and 11th centuries, but the present structure is most likely of the late-medieval period from around the 17th century during which time the castle was reconstructed. It is likely that the temple of Ghalinjakar mentioned in the 13th-century works of an unnamed Georgian historian, is in fact Berdavan. Some additional reconstruction took place in the 1980s. Ruins were cleared out, and the poorly constructed upper portions of the serf walls and towers were broken down and reconstructed. The two northeastern towers are currently being reconstructed. Archaeological excavations at the site have uncovered ceramic plates, metal axes and other items giving insight to the lives of those who lived and worked at Berdavan.  Architecture   Fortress  The walls of the fortress are laid out in a triangular plan with ramparts linked together by eleven semi-cylindrical exterior towers that taper very little to the top and end at the same height as the walls. Because of the sloping topography at the site, the towers vary in height from at the southwest end and on the northwest end. Fortification walls are thick. There is only one portal (1 meter in width) leading into the interior of the fortress, and it is at the western wall. Stairs are south of the entry. Within the confines of the fortress walls were once shelters, storehouses and other buildings. A secret passage had once led from the fortress to the canyon below in the event of a siege. Part of the passageway (the height of a human) may still be seen at the lower portion of the eastern corner tower. The tower has an open interior, with a high door leading to the passage.  Church  Ruins of a triple-nave church with an adjacent medieval cemetery and chapel are southwest of the fortress. It is assumed that the structure was built around the late-medieval period, around the time of the foundation of the fortress in the 10th century because of the layout, decorative elements and the building technique. The walls of the church still stand at their original height but the roof has since collapsed and parts of the structure lie buried. Walls are constructed of a slightly hewn yellowish felsite stone with some fragments of khachkars imbedded into the exterior. There is only one portal leading into the structure from the northern wall, likely constructed from stones taken from another monument. Above the entry is a tympanum style lintel. Two iron rings positioned at either side of the portal indicate that there was once a wooden hall in front. The rectangular prayer hall, , was once divided into three naves by a pair of arches. Inset wall-pillars once stood at the walls to the north and the south. Remainders of arches and their footings are located above where the pillars stood, while the arches that had once spanned the naves are now gone. At the eastern side of the church is a semi- circular apse with a high stage and two \\"studies\\" or prayer rooms adjacent at either side. Walls of a separate chapel south of the church have a pair of khachkars of the 12th or 13th century perched on a high pedestal. At the cemetery there is an unusual and large tevor khachkar, meaning \\"cross stone with arms\\" in the yard. The stone has been carved in the shape of a cross and sits in a cube-shaped stone pedestal. The face of the khachkar has bas-relief carvings of crosses and standing human figures that sit in separate \\"panels\\".

He was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1856 and between 1861 and 1886. He was also a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly between 1856 and 1860. Early life Campbell was the eldest son of Sophia Palmer and Robert Campbell a pioneer Sydney merchant and member of the Legislative Council. He was also the elder brother of Robert Campbell Jr who, at various times, was a member of the Legislative Council and Assembly and Colonial Treasurer. In addition, his youngest brother Charles was a member of the Legislative Council, and his nephew William was a member of the Legislative Council and Assembly between 1868 and 1906. Campbell was educated in England between 1810 and 1820 and joined his father's business after returning to Australia. He became the sole owner of the business in 1859 and was a noted philanthropist who donated much of his fortune to the Anglican Church of Australia. He was the founder of the Anglican Diocese of Riverina. Colonial Parliament Campbell was appointed to the first New South Wales Legislative Council which was convened after the establishment of responsible self-government in 1856. However he resigned after 17 days to unsuccessfully contest a ministerial by-election for the seat of Sydney Hamlets. He was defeated by the premier, Stuart Donaldson but Donaldson again resigned from the seat when he accepted a position in the government of Henry Parker in October 1856. Campbell defeated Donaldson at the subsequent by-election and was re-elected at the 1858 colonial election. He transferred to the seat of Glebe at the 1859 election but resigned from the Assembly to concentrate on the family business prior to the election in 1860. He subsequently received a life appointment to the Legislative Council.

He was born in Cienaga, Magdalena, Colombia, in 1968. Works He has written books of poetry: The Invisible creature in the twilight of William Turner (1997), considered one of the best books published in Colombia during the twentieth century, Come to these yellow sands (2004), The Red wine of syllables(2007) and The Geometry of Water (2009). His poetry has begun to generate interest within and outside his country, and his new book, The Geometry of Water, published by Norma, was presented at the Book Fairs in Buenos Aires and in Mainz in 2010 with success. Paper Museum, engraving and printing of Argentina is being translated into English, French, German and Russian. Contemporaries, between critics and writers as William Ospina (winner of Prize Romulo Gallegos 2008), Juan Gustavo Cobo-Borda and Jos√© Ram√≥n Ripoll, agree that Fernando Denis is one of today's most original voices in the poetry of Latin America. He is currently finishing his first novel, expected to be base on his own life. The Geometry of Water was translated and published in India by Sahitya Akademi in November 2010. Psychology \\"Fernando Denis is the successful result of a happy schizophrenia. On the one hand, from the world's creative craters near the Caribbean Sea and tropical nights to flights to heaven of Remedios the Beauty (Remedios La bella from One hundred years of solitude by Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez ), the ghosts that evaporate and mangrove swamps. On the other hand, an irresistible fascination for the world of painting, which burns with fire his eyes with work of William Turner, Denis lost his footsteps in the stairs that lead nowhere in the engravings of Piranesi, and definitely went mad with tigers that Jorge Luis Borges imagined blue. His cult purpose: to become a myth of our poetry, oscillating between anger in Bogota Bohemian night and the memory of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Ability to dissolve the reason in one color, in music, is one of his disturbing virtues,\\" enthusiastically wrote Juan Gustavo Cobo Borda. Themes His poetry is concerned with the exterior landscape, one that contains the colours of nature, and much like the twilight of William Turner, his poems contain magic and fire. The cadence and the sounds of ancient texts have a taste, stuffed with a lot of painting, monologues versatile female voices that rise from the dust to christen the new language. He is currently the most read poet in his country and is the new icon of the new generation in Colombia. \\"The most obvious virtue of the poetry of Fernando Denis is originality,\\" wrote William Ospina. \\"None of us refers to the words with more freedom, so when we read him the most common reader reaction is amazement, bewilderment.\\" Reviews In the preface to the Venezuelan edition of his book The sea throws its gold coins, Jos√© Ram√≥n Ripoll, musicologist, editor of the Atlantic Magazine and one of the most acclaimed masters of modern Spanish poetry, wrote \\"Fernando Denis is a versatile poet, dense and full, in the sense that he looks and names the world without fuss, making all his experience in poetic material, from the high peaks of the mountains to the splash of the tread on his shoes puddles.\\" External links 20th-century Colombian novelists Colombian male novelists 20th-century Colombian poets Colombian male poets People from Magdalena Department 1968 births Living people 21st-century Colombian poets 21st-century male writers 20th-century male writers ","title":"Fernando Denis"},{"id":"30099544","text":"Echeverr√≠a is a station on Line B of the Buenos Aires Underground.

This quantity is important in geotechnical engineering, particularly for finding the expected settlement of foundations and embankments. Alternative names for the preconsolidation pressure are preconsolidation stress, pre-compression stress, pre-compaction stress, and preload stress. A soil is called overconsolidated if the current effective stress acting on the soil is less than the historical maximum. The preconsolidation pressure can help determine the largest overburden pressure that can be exerted on a soil without irrecoverable volume change. This type of volume change is important for understanding shrinkage behavior, crack and structure formation and resistance to shearing stresses. Previous stresses and other changes in a soil's history are preserved within the soil's structure. If a soil is loaded beyond this point the soil is unable to sustain the increased load and the structure will break down. This breakdown can cause a number of different things depending on the type of soil and its geologic history. Preconsolidation pressure cannot be measured directly, but can be estimated using a number of different strategies. Samples taken from the field are subjected to a variety of tests, like the constant rate of strain test (CRS) or the incremental loading test (IL). These tests can be costly due to expensive equipment and the long period of time they require. Each sample must be undisturbed and can only undergo one test with satisfactory results. It is important to execute these tests precisely to ensure an accurate resulting plot. There are various methods for determining the preconsolidation pressure from lab data. The data is usually arranged on a semilog plot of the effective stress (frequently represented as œÉ'vc) versus the void ratio. This graph is commonly called the e log p curve or the consolidation curve. Methods The preconsolidation pressure can be estimated in a number of different ways but not measured directly. It is useful to know the range of expected values depending on the type of soil being analyzed. For example, in samples with natural moisture content at the liquid limit (liquidity index of 1), preconsolidation ranges between about 0.1 and 0.8 tsf, depending on soil sensitivity (defined as the ratio of undisturbed peak undrained shear strength to totally remolded undrained shear strength). For natural moisture at the plastic limit (liquidity index equal to zero), preconsolidation ranges from about 12 to 25 tsf. See Atterberg limits for information about soil properties like liquidity index and liquid limit. Arthur Casagrande's graphical method The consolidation curve for a saturated clay showing the procedure for finding the preconsolidation pressure. Using a consolidation curve:(Casagrande 1936) # Choose by eye the point of maximum curvature on the consolidation curve. # Draw a horizontal line from this point. # Draw a line tangent to the curve at the point found in part 1. # Bisect the angle made from the horizontal line in part 2 and the tangent line in part 3. # Extend the \\"straight portion\\" of the virgin compression curve (high effective stress, low void ratio: almost vertical on the right of the graph) up to the bisector line in part 4. The point where the lines in part 4 and part 5 intersect is the preconsolidation pressure. Gregory et al. proposed an analytical method to calculate preconsolidation stress that avoids subjective interpretations of the location of the maximum curvature point (i.e. Minimum radius of curvature). Tom√°s et al. used this method to calculate the preconsolidation pressure of 139 undisturbed soil samples to generate preconsolidation pressure maps of the Vega Baja of the Segura (Spain). Estimation of the \\"most probable\\" preconsolidation pressure Using a consolidation curve, intersect the horizontal portion of the recompression curve and a line tangent to the compression curve. This point is within the range of probable preconsolidation pressures. It can be used in calculations that require less accuracy or if a rough estimate is all that is required. See \\"Modeling Volume Change and Mechanical Properties with Hydraulic Models,\\" from the Soil Science Society of America (link in references) for a more involved mathematical model based on Casagrande's method combining principles from soil mechanics and hydraulics. Mechanisms causing preconsolidation Various different factors can cause a soil to approach its preconsolidation pressure: * Change in total stress due to removal of overburden can cause preconsolidation pressure in a soil. For example, removal of structures or glaciation would cause a change in total stress that would have this effect. * Change in pore water pressure: A change in water table elevation, Artesian pressures, deep pumping or flow into tunnels, and desiccation due to surface drying or plant life can bring soil to its preconsolidation pressure. * Change in soil structure due to aging (secondary compression): Over time, soil will consolidate even after high pressures from loading and pore water pressure have been depleted. * Environmental changes: Changes in pH, temperature, and salt concentration can cause a soil to approach its preconsolidation pressure. * Chemical weathering: Different types of chemical weathering will cause preconsolidation pressure. Precipitation, cementing agents, and ion exchange are a few examples. Uses Preconsolidation pressure is used in many calculations of soil properties essential for structural analysis and soil mechanics. One of the primary uses is to predict settlement of a structure after loading. This is required for any construction project such as new buildings, bridges, large roads and railroad tracks. All of these require site evaluation before construction. Preparing a site for construction requires an initial compression of the soil to prepare for foundation to be added. It is important to know the preconsolidation pressure because it will help to determine the amount of loading that is appropriate for the site. It will also help to determine whether recompression (after excavation), if the conditions allow, soil can exhibit volumetric expansion, recompression, due to the removal of load conditions need to be considered.

G., Aristotle's Protrepticus and the Sources of its Reconstruction. University of California Press, 1957. Print. pg. 1. It survives only in fragments and is considered a lost work. Reconstructions Since the 19th century, when inquiry was initiated by Jakob Bernays (1863), several scholars have attempted to reconstruct the work. Attempted reconstructions include: *A 1961 book by Ingemar D√ºring *A 1964 book by Anton-Hermann Chroust *2015 Protrepticus or Exhortation to Philosophy by Hutchinson and Johnson Commentary The book The works of Aristotle (1908, p. viii) mentioned :The Historia Augusta says that Cicero's Hortensius was modelled on the Protrepticus and as the Hortensius was a dialogue, the Protrepticus was probably one too. There is thus good evidence that several of the nineteen works that stand at the head of Diogenes' and Hesychius' lists were dialogues; it may be inferred with high probability, though not with certainty, that the others were so too, but Stobaeus, pp. 59, 61 infra, and Athenaeus, p. 61 infra, confirm its genuineness. Protreptic A book review of Exhortations to Philosophy (2015), mentioned :Philosophers of fourth-century BCE Athens developed the emerging genre of the \\"protreptic\\" (literally, \\"turning\\" or \\"converting\\"). Simply put, protreptic discourse uses a rhetoric of conversion that urges a young person to adopt a specific philosophy in order to live a good life. Clark (1989), mentioned :Throughout Iamblichus's lifetime (ca. 245 AD) Christianity was making converts, even in the philosophical schools and among his own friends. (p. x) Translations 1908 Elias in Porph. 3. 17-23. We may also reason as Aristotle does in his Protrepticus, in which he encourages young men to philosophize. He says this: If we ought to philosophize we ought to philosophize, and if we ought not to philosophize we ought to philosophize; in either case, therefore, we ought to philosophize. If philosophy exists we ought certainly to philosophize, because philosophy exists; and if it does not exist, even so we ought to examine why it does not exist, and in examining this we shall be philosophizing, because examination is what makes philosophy. (p. 28) 1995 Pierre Hadot (into French), Michael Chase (translator into English of Hadot's volume): 2015 Hutchinson and Johnson :Indeed, as Aristotle says in his writing entitled Protrepticus, in which he exhorts the youth to do philosophy - he says this: if you should do philosophy, you should do philosophy, and if you should not do philosophy, then you should do philo- sophy. Therefore in every case you should do philosophy. For if philosophy exists, then positively we are obliged to do philosophy, since it truly exists. But if it does not truly exist, even so we are obliged to investigate how it is that philosophy does not truly exist. But by investigating we would be doing philosophy, since to investigate is the cause of philosophy. Excerpt from a speech by the character ‚ÄòAristotle‚Äô (Hutchinson and Johnson, p. 12) :If we have gathered any seed or principle of this kind of cognition by which we passed from a previous verbal acceptance of what kind of science it is to precisely observing what sort of thing its nature is, this came to us from no other source than from them mathematics. But also the power of the science established it more clearly by its own arguments in the demonstrations about them. Moreover it is the understanding of these things that has corrected us from being led astray when we were persuaded by many of the appearances, clearly establishing the truth about them, whatever it is. :For some of those who wish to advance them would not seem to assign to them the appropriate position, when they assert that we need to create understanding of them because a training in them is useful for other theoretical fields. For those things for the sake of which they encourage us to do this are by their nature less close relatives of the truth, even in the usual speeches spoken about them, nor are they champions in terms of the precision of their demonstrations. And here‚Äôs a sufficient indication of this: we see them enduring and being believed continually in the same way by those who take up those fields, but in the other fields we would discover extremely few demonstrations that are at all like that. :Now then, mathematical philosophy has helped us, both for many of the necessities for life, and also for those things that are worthwhile in themselves, as soon as we are affluent. For even among the industrial arts, in quite a few cases we would find that mathematics has come to their assistance. And as for natural philosophy, even if some other one were to have a more exalted position, we would see that it makes use of many of the things that we have seen in their own demonstrations, which we have observed by the things that were mentioned.

Despite succeeding in his attempts to found a city in northeastern Jackson County and in rebuilding the community after it was afflicted by widespread fire in 1888, Harvey Wells was chronically deep in debt. After his death in 1896, the house was emptied of many of its contents, as his furniture had to be sold to reduce the debt that embarrassed his estate. He never owned the house or the land upon which it sits. During the mid-2000s, a restoration program was started, due in part to an appropriation of $100,000 in the state government's 2005‚Äì2006 budget. The first phase of reconstruction, which consisted of basic preservation efforts and stabilization, was completed by the end of 2005.Annual Report FY 2005 , Ohio Cultural Facilities Commission, 2005, 12.

Jeanne, the tenth tropical storm of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, struck the United States territory of Puerto Rico on September 15, with . While crossing the island, the storm dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at at Aibonito, with a total of on the offshore island of Vieques. The rainfall caused widespread flooding, resulting in landslides and heavy crop damage. Winds reached 72 mph (117 km/h) at Cayey, and its combination with the rainfall left most of the island without power or water. Before Jeanne struck, the Puerto Rican governor ordered shutting down the island's entire power supply to prevent electrocution deaths. In the days after the storm, the power and water were restored. With damage totaling $169.5 million (2004 USD), President George W. Bush declared Puerto Rico as a disaster area, which allocated federal funds for assistance. Ultimately, more than 155,933 people received $401.1 million in aid. Overall, Jeanne caused eight deaths on the island, four of which directly, and the name was eventually retired from the naming list. Preparations Hurricane Jeanne originated as a tropical depression on September 13 from a tropical wave, just east of the Lesser Antilles. At that time, the United States government issued a tropical storm warning for the entirety of Puerto Rico, about 43 hours prior to Jeanne making landfall on the island. As it moved through the northeastern Caribbean Sea the storm steadily intensified, and by late on September 14 Jeanne was forecast to move across the island as a minimal hurricane. As a result, the tropical storm warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning. Ultimately, Jeanne made landfall at 1600 UTC on September 15 as a tropical storm, about 17 mi (29 km) east of Guayama. Prior to hitting, 3,629 people evacuated to 159 schools converted into emergency shelters. Governor Sila Mar√≠a Calder√≥n forbade the sale of alcohol during the storm. All ports around the island were closed, and most flights were canceled. Due to the threat for downed wires, the governor ordered for the entire island's power grid to be turned off during the storm. During Hurricane Hugo in 1989, six people were electrocuted to death, which influenced the decision. In addition, ferry trips from the main island to Vieques and Culebra stopped during the storm. In Vega Baja, an elderly man fell from a roof to his death while installing storm shutters. As Jeanne moved ashore, an eye was in the process of developing, indicating winds near hurricane status, although hurricane-force winds still affected higher elevations. Jeanne quickly crossed Puerto Rico and eventually attained hurricane status in the Mona Passage between the island and Dominican Republic. Impact Rainfall map of Jeanne in Puerto Rico Upon striking Puerto Rico, Jeanne produced tropical storm force winds in portions of the island. A NWS employee reported sustained winds of , with gusts to in Salinas along the southern coast. In Cayey, located in the center of the island, a 72 mph (117 km/h) gust was reported, just shy of hurricane force. Additionally, the Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n International Airport in San Juan reported sustained winds of 49 mph (80 km/h). In Yabucoa, the winds killed one woman after she was flung into a wall. Most of Jeanne's impact came from its rainfall. The heaviest precipitation fell on the island Vieques with a total of in three days. There, a 24‚Äëhour total of was reported, a 1 in 100 year event. On the Puerto Rican mainland, the rainfall averaged from 5-15 in (127-381 mm), peaking at at Aibonito in the center of the island. At that station, the rainfall reached in a 24‚Äëhour period, surpassing a 1 in 100 year event. Heavy rainfall also fell on the offshore island of Culebra. The heavy rainfall caused severe flooding along many rivers of Puerto Rico, forcing 3,629 people to evacuate their houses in flood zones. The one and only flood-related death occurred when a person drowned in the Culebrinas River in Moca. Across the island, Jeanne produced mudslides and landslides and left $8 million in damage (2004 USD) to the water system; about 600,000 people were left without running water. Throughout Puerto Rico, Tropical Storm Jeanne heavily damaged schools, houses, businesses. Strong wind gusts left 70% of the island without power, and damage to the electrical grid totaled $60 million (2004 USD). The combination of fallen trees, landslides, and debris closed 302 roads and left many bridges damaged. The storm left heavy crop damage in the southern and eastern portion of the island, particularly to coffee, plantain, banana, and wheat crops. In Jayuya, the storm destroyed 30% of the coffee crop. Of the $101.5 million crop damage total, more than half was from the banana crop. Overall, more than of croplands were affected. Overall, Jeanne killed four people directly in Puerto Rico. Damage totaled $169.5 million (2004 USD), which was the highest from a tropical cyclone since Hurricane Georges in 1998. Aftermath Following the passage of the storm, two people died due to carbon monoxide poisoning after running a generator in closed space without proper ventilation. Two others died and another injured when a tree damaged by winds fell onto their car near Yauco. Due to contaminated water supplies, authorities advised people to boil water before consumption. In the day after the storm's passage, electric companies restored power to all but 870,000 people. Most of the western portion of the island was repaired first, as were hospitals and the Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n International Airport. On September 17, two days after Jeanne struck, United States President George W. Bush declared Puerto Rico a disaster area, which provided for the cost of debris removal and emergency services. In the immediate aftermath, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funded crisis counseling services for storm victims, set up by the Puerto Rico Department of Health/ Mental Health and Anti- Addiction Services Administration. After the storm's passage, FEMA established six disaster recovery centers. Ultimately, more than 206,000 people applied for disaster assistance, including grants for essential repairs and temporary housing. FEMA approved the request for 155,933 people, providing $401.1 million in aid. In March 2005, the US Government provided $14.6 million in aid for reconstruction projects, including repairs to the power grid, as well as general road and bridge restoration. Due to its damage along its path, Hurricane Jeanne was retired by the World Meteorological Organization in Spring 2005, meaning the name will never be used again for an Atlantic hurricane. The name was replaced by Julia which was used during the 2010 season.

Production The Nikkatsu Company conceived Take Aim at the Police Van as a borderless action film, a studio subgenre with internationalized characters and setting. Contract director Seijun Suzuki had previously worked mainly on pop song films, a youth subgenre in which the films were built around an already popular song, and yakuza films with an occasional film noir bent. It also marked the beginning of his practice of co- writing his films. Leading man Michitaro Mizushima had also starred in Suzuki's Underworld Beauty two years earlier. He was atypical of borderless action films by virtue of his age, forty-eight at the time, as they typically featured Nikkatsu's younger stars such as Yujiro Ishihara and Akira Kobayashi. Release Take Aim at the Police Van was released in Japan by the Nikkatsu Company on January 27, 1960. It was subsequently released in a five-film DVD box set, titled Nikkatsu Noir, in North America on August 25, 2009, under The Criterion Collection's Eclipse label. The set focuses on noir-themed Nikkatsu Action films and also includes I Am Waiting (1957), Rusty Knife (1958), Cruel Gun Story (1964) and A Colt Is My Passport (1967) with liner notes by film historian Chuck Stephens. The A.V. Club's Noel Murray felt the film holds up against contemporary Hollywood film noirs. Rating it less abstract than Seijun Suzuki's films of a few years later, he highlighted its vim and social candor and named it \\"[a testament] to how artists pumping out quickie exploitation product can often work in truths about their times that prestige filmmakers can't.\\" References External links * Original trailer at The Criterion Collection Take Aim at the Police Van at the Kinema Junpo Movie Database 1960 films Japanese films Japanese-language films Films directed by Seijun Suzuki Nikkatsu films Films with screenplays by Shinichi Sekizawa ","title":"Take Aim at the Police Van"},{"id":"30099830","text":"SNPG can refer to: * Scottish National Portrait Gallery * Soci√©t√© Nationale Petroli√®re Gabonaise ","title":"SNPG"},{"id":"30099851","text":"King of Devil's Island (), () is a 2010 French-Norwegian action drama film directed by Marius Holst.Twitchfilm.com ‚Äì Second trailer for Marius Holsts youth prison drama King of Devil's Island Retrieved 2.

Under the rule of H√•kon, Erling comes to terms with the harsh winter, the mistreatment by the staff, and the hated Housefather Br√•then. Later, Olav sees Br√•then molesting \\"C5\\", Ivar, a timid, shy boy in the laundry room. When he raises this with the Governor, the boys are severely punished and C5 is reassigned to duties far away from Br√•then. However, after hearing that Br√•then expects him to be back in the laundry room tomorrow Ivar drowns himself in the freezing Norwegian waters, while the rest of the boys are chopping wood. Br√•then is apparently fired, to the overwhelming delight of the other boys. Olav is paroled and is planning to leave, but on the way to the departing boat, walks past Br√•then, who had been sent away on a shopping trip until Olav, the only witness to Ivar's rape, had left Bast√∏y. Olav and Erling attack Br√•then and as punishment they are locked in the freezing solitary confinement. They are freed by Bjern, one of the few Bast√∏y boys who has remained on the island as a caretaker. Olav again pursues Br√•then, and the attack inspires a mass uprising. The boys ransack the prison, and drive away the staff. Br√•then is repeatedly hanged and released and then beaten. The barn he is in is set ablaze, but Erling drags him to safety. The navy is brought in and violently puts down the uprising. Olav and Erling manage to escape across a frozen fjord back to the mainland, but Erling falls through a gap in the ice close to shore and quickly freezes to death.

History After Mihindu Maha Thero brought Buddhism to Sri Lanka in 250BC, his sister, Theri Sanghamitta arrived in Sri Lanka with a Sacred Bo Sapling one year later to this port. The temple Samudda-panasala (Jambukola Viharaya) was built commemorating the arrival of the Bo sapling by King Devanampiya Tissa (250-210 BC). Later, the same king planted one of the first eight shoots of the Sri Maha Bodhi, on the same place where he kept the original tree before bringing it to Anuradhapura. King Vijayabahu I (1070‚Äì1110) has restored this site. The remains of the vihara, such as the Buddha footprint stone and vatadage seen up to recent times no longer exist there. This port gradually faded in importance while port Mahathiththa/ Mahathota/ Mantota (now Mantai) located at the mouth of Malvatu oya developed as a key intersection of sea-routes and the Dambakola Patuna Viharaya was lost in time. The Great Chronicle of Sri Lanka, the Mahavamsa and Samanthapaasasdika mention pilgrims coming from \\"Yonaka\\" country to Jambukola to worship the Jambukola Viharaya in the ancient times. Present Unfortunately today there is nothing on the temple which shows any antiquity. Most of the structures in the temple including the stupa which has been completed in a record 65 days have been done by the Sri Lankan Navy. Even the current bo tree was planted in 1998 by the Navy.

The English-language versions of his operettas, Le droit d'a√Ænesse (1883) and Les noces improvis√©es (1886) became very popular in Britain and the United States. Chassaigne was married to the Swiss-born operetta singer Louise Roland. Biography Chassaigne's wife, Louise Roland Born D√©sir√©-Fran√ßois Chassaigne in Brussels in 1847, Chassaigne studied music there before settling in Paris. His first compositions were popular songs for the operetta stars of the day such as \\"Jeanne la Saboti√®re\\" for Th√©r√©sa and \\"Peureuse\\" for Louise Th√©o. By the mid-1870s he had become a prolific composer of one-act op√©ras bouffes and sayn√®tes (short musical plays) for the caf√©- concerts of Paris, most of which premiered at the Eldorado. In 1882, he was given the chance to compose his first full-length operetta by Jules Brasseur, the director of the Th√©√¢tre des Nouveaut√©s. Dedicated to Brasseur, Chassaigne's three-act Le droit d'a√Ænesse with a libretto by Eug√®ne Leterrier and Albert Vanloo premiered at the Nouveaut√©s on 27 January 1883. It was only a partial success, but its English version Falka, with a libretto translated and adapted by Henry Farnie, was popular in English-speaking countries for many years. His second full-length operetta, Les noces improvis√©es premiered at the Th√©√¢tre des Bouffes-Parisiens on 13 February 1886. The English version, Nadgy (or Nadjy), with a libretto translated and adapted by Alfred Murray premiered at the Casino Theatre in New York on May 14, 1888, and again proved very popular. On the strength of these successes the theatrical producer, Rudolph Aronson, commissioned another opera directly from Chassaigne with the libretto to be written by Henry Farnie. Farnie died in 1889 having completed only an outline of the work, which he had called La Mexicana. In the end, the libretto was written by Max Pemberton, Edgar Smith, and William Lestocq, and called The Brazilian. It premiered at the Theatre Royal in Newcastle upon Tyne on 19 April 1890. Its American premiere followed in October of that year at Aronson's Casino Theatre in New York. However, The Brazilian did not achieve the same success as Falka and Nadgy.G√§nzl (1994) pp. 253-254 According to Aronson's memoirs, Chaissaigne had planned to compose a further operetta for him, based on Louis XIV at Versailles, but this was never completed.Aronson (1913) p. 178. Aronson had clearly lost touch with Chassaigne, as he stated in his memoirs that Chassaigne had died before he could complete the promised operetta. However, Chassaigne outlived Aronson by two years. Chassaigne was married to the Swiss-born operetta and vaudeville singer Louise Roland who appeared frequently at the Th√©√¢tre des Vari√©t√©s. Both she and Chassaigne were members of Les Hydropathes, a famous Parisian literary club founded by the French writer √âmile Goudeau, many of whose members where singers and stage artists. The daughter of a theatre director, Roland was born in 1851 and began performing at the age of five. She created a number of roles in the operettas of the day and was also an accomplished dancer.Paulus (circa 1906) p. 213 After her retirement from the stage, she had a successful career touring as a concert singer, often accompanied on the piano by Chassaigne. In 1912, the couple published Servatoire, described as a three-act com√©die vocale (sung comedy). Chassaigne died in Le Raincy in 1922 at the age of 75. Louise Roland died sometime after 1924.Goudeau (1888/2000) p. 535 Works ;Stage works Cover of the piano/vocal score for Le droit d'a√Ænesse, Chassaigne's first full-length operetta *Un coq en jupons (libretto by Gaston Villemer); premiered at the Alcazar d'√ât√©, 1870 *La berg√®re de Bougival (libretto by Gaston Villemer and Lucien Delormel); premiered at the Eldorado, 1872 *Les horreurs du carnaval (libretto by Auguste Jouhaud); premiered at the Eldorado, 1873 *Une double cl√© (libretto by Jules de Rieux); premiered at the Eldorado, 1873 *Monsieur Auguste (libretto by Jules de Rieux); premiered at the Eldorado, 1873 *Le professeur de tyrolienne (libretto by Gaston Villemer and Lucien Delormel); premiered at the Eldorado, 1874 *Un table de caf√© (libretto by Jules de Reiux and A.

One unit was converted to 1.5 kV DC operation under electric catenary, and used for evaluation by the Nederlandse Spoorwegen, as NS Class 1600P. History The class represents a major milestone in the German locomotive development, since in these locomotives three phase asynchronous electric traction was first applied in a mainline diesel-electric locomotive. The DE2500 featured a light-weight and completely modular construction, which allowed the quick and easy exchange of whole sections of the locomotive, such as the prime mover, generator or alternator sections. It was both capable of driving on Co'Co' bogies (002, 004) as well as Bo'Bo' bogies (003). All the components of the electric sections - from generator to traction motors - were built to the latest state of the art featuring brushless, collectorless and nearly contactless operation, which resulted in long service intervals and high reliability. The locomotives were extensively tested by the Deutsche Bundesbahn on its lines throughout Western Germany, starting in 1971 through the mid-1980s. They were stationed at Bw Mannheim with the following DB numbers: * 202 002-2 (white) * 202 003-0 (orange, later UmAn paint scheme) * 202 004-8 (blue) Conversion to electric locomotive During the mid-1970s, locomotive 202-002 was converted for the Dutch railways (NS) into an all- electric locomotive for 1.5 kV DC-overhead wire. It was painted in the Dutch yellow scheme, assigned the number 1600P and given the logos of the Dutch railways. A pantograph for the collection of the current from the overhead wire was installed, the diesel prime mover and the generator section were removed and replaced with ballast weight. The NS was very pleased with the results of the test cycles, but ultimately chose to acquire its serial- production Class 1600 from French manufacturers, based on the BB 7200, for both budget and delivery time considerations. Test-run in Denmark The Danish State Railways, DSB, tested the locomotive 202 004. The later acquired DSB Class ME, though heavier and stronger (115 t, 3.300 hp), were based on these prototypes. 37 of the class were built. Models DB Class 202 003 in Berlin museum.

It is the second largest island in the Oslo basin, after Nes√∏ya. It is adjacent to the municipal border with Asker, where Nes√∏ya and Br√∏nn√∏ya are to its northwest and southwest, respectively. Within B√¶rum, Bor√∏ya is to the north, Kjeholmen to the northeast, and Grims√∏ya to the east. To the south is G√•s√∏ya. History At some point the island was split in two. The island is named after the farm that is situated on it. The etymology of Oust, or Ost is uncertain. O. Rygh claims the etymology is unknown but that the farm derives its name from the island's original name. Others speculate that it may have an Old Norse origin related to ouste, in the sense of claiming new land. In 1396, the (pre- Reformation) diocese in Oslo was listed as the owner of farm (then spelled Ost) and the island, and by 1557 (after the Reformation) it was owned by the crown and spelled Oust. In 1791, the owner is listed as Hans Haagensen Tveter, and his descendants still own the main farm. In accordance with practice at the time, they also took the last name Oust. They successfully petitioned the minister at Haslum church for their own gravesite, citing the distance to the church and the need to quickly bury cholera victims. A royal grant was given. In 1899 a significant portion of the island (Lille Oust) was sold for recreational summer houses. Nature reserve Two areas of the island have been set aside as nature reserves: *Oust naturreservat was established in 2002 and consists of 128,5 hectares,of which 5,5 hectares,is marineland. *Syd Oust naturreservat was established on June 27, 2008 and consists of , of which is on land.

The company built over 150 power plants and installed over 2,000 MW. As of February 2016 Ormat owns and operates 697 MW of geothermal and recovered energy based power plants. The company's shares have been listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange since 1991, and the New York Stock Exchange since 2004. The company's main production facilities are based in Yavne, Israel. History Ormat was established in 1965 as Ormat Turbines Ltd. (later renamed Ormat Industries), in Yavne, Israel, by engineer Lucien Bronicki (who was the company's chairman and CTO until 2014) and wife Yehudit \\"Dita\\" Bronicki (who served as CEO until 2014). In the late 1950s Lucien Bronicki worked in a government physics laboratory, where he developed a turbine to produce electricity from a range of energy sources, including solar; the process is known as organic Rankine cycle, which he co-developed with Harry Zvi Tabor. He retired from the lab to commercialize his ideas and set up Ormat. In its early years the company focused exclusively on manufacturing power generation equipment. The 1970s energy crisis increased interest in efficient generation technology. To exploit this situation, Ormat obtained financial assistance from the Israeli government and raised capital from private investors to build one of the world's first solar-driven power stations. However the power station was not economically viable and was abandoned in 1988. During the 1980s Ormat developed generation systems utilizing recovered energy, i.e. heat emitted during industrial processes. The company also applied its technology to generate electricity from geothermal sources. In 1986, Ormat designed and supplied geothermal power systems to the Kawerau Power Station in New Zealand. Since then, 13 geothermal power plants were built by Ormat in New Zealand.The World‚Äôs Largest Binary Geothermal Power Plant Opens in New Zealand In 1989, Ormat supplied geothermal equipment for the regional heating system at Sudurnes Iceland; which utilizes the abundant local geothermal resources to provide heating for 20,000 people.Sudurnes Regional Heating Corp. In the 1990s the company decided not only to provide power generation equipment, but also to own and operate alternative and renewable energy power stations. In 1991, the company, then as Ormat Industries, listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. In 1992, Ormat acquired a controlling stake of Bet Shemesh Engines, a manufactures parts for jet engines, that also overhauls, maintains and assembles jet engines. In 2005, Ormat sold its shares the company.Bronicki Family Parts Ways With Revamped Bet Shemesh Engines, Haaretz, 8 April 2005 In 2004, Ormat Technologies, completed an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange raising $100 million. Ormat Technologies was founded in 1994 as a US subsidiary of Ormat Industries. Following the initial public offering, Ormat Industries was restructured as a holding company that was still listed in the exchange, while shifting all its operations to the subsidiary Ormat Technologies.Ormat Technologies files for $100m Wall St. IPO, Globes, 21/07/2004 In 2006, Ormat received for the first time, an order for to supply equipment for a geothermal power plant in Germany. In February 2015, Ormat Technologies Inc. acquired its parent company, Ormat Industries Ltd., in an all-stock merger. Shareholders of Ormat Technologies retained about 38 percent of the company's shares, while Ormat Industries Ltd. shareholders owned the remaining 62 percent. Ormat Technologies Inc. shares were listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.Ormat Technologies to Acquire Parent Company in All-Stock Merger, Bloomberg, November 10, 2014 Operations The company owns and operates geothermal power plants in California, Nevada, Hawaii, Guatemala, Kenya and Guadeloupe. Technologies An Ormat Energy Converter (OEC) at a geothermal generation power plant, in Landau, Germany Thermal energy Ormat's core technology is the Ormat Energy Converter (OEC) power generation unit. It converts low and medium temperature heat into electrical energy, with low or zero emission of CO2 and pollutants. The OEC's main components are a vaporizer/preheater, turbo-generator, air-cooled or water-cooled condenser, feed pump and controls. Ormat has installed more than 900 MW of geothermal and recovered energy generation (REG) power units, based on OEC technology. Ormat's technology is optimized for use in geothermal energy generation, and the company is the third largest geothermal producer in the United States. The technology is also suitable for recovered energy power generation, which converts waste heat from industrial processes into electricity that can be used on site or sold to power generation utilities. Ormat's recovered energy technology was deployed in projects in Germany, Canada, India, USA and Japan. Solar energy In the 1980s Ormat built and operated one of the world's first power stations to produce electricity from solar energy, located just north of the Dead Sea in Israel. The plant utilized a technology known as solar pond, a large-scale solar thermal energy collector with integral heat storage for supplying thermal energy. It was the largest operating solar pond ever built for electricity generation and operated until 1988. It had an area of 210,000 m2 and gave an electrical output of 5 MW.Carl Nielson, Aliakbar Akbarzedeh, John Andrews, Humberto R Becerra L and Peter Golding, 'The History of Solar Pond Science & Technology', Proceedings of the International Solar Energy Society, 2005. After the decommissioning of the solar pool project, Ormat was not active in the solar energy market until its entry into the Solar PV market.  Oil sands Ormat's former parent company, Ormat Industries Ltd., developed an energy-efficient technology, OrCrude, for extracting crude oil from oil sands. The OrCrude process is claimed to be more efficient than other technologies as it includes gasification, which substantially reduces the requirement for natural gas, typically the largest input cost in an in-situ oil sands project. The technology is used in the Long Lake project, a former joint venture between Nexen and OPTI Canada. In 2010, Ormat Industries sold all its holdings (5.1%) in OPTI Canada. In 2011, OPTI Canada was acquired by CNOOC Luxembourg S.√† r.l, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CNOOC Limited. Spin offs Ormat has been involved in establishment and development of several companies, including: Orbotech develops and manufactures automated optical inspection (AOI) systems for bare and assembled printed circuit boards and flat panel displays. The company's systems, imaging and computer-aided manufacturing technologies enable electronic manufacturers to achieve the increased yields and throughput essential for electronics production. Orad Hi-Tec Systems Ltd. develops video and real-time image processing technologies for TV broadcasting, Internet, production studio and sports events.

As a member of the \\"post-80s\\" generation of artists in China, Wu has been involved in several group shows since 2003. Impressed by the bright colors and patterns, Wu takes the cotton print as a carrier of her language so as to express her thinking towards life through painting. In 2002, she started to draw Coca-Cola, Statue of Liberty, Blessed Mother and Holy Son. Taking a piece of cloth with traditional Chinese Characteristics, she wanted to create a pictorial and language conflict between the two parts mentioned. So she found and installed the typical western images on the cotton print, thus leading to a contrast between the local and the foreign.Suzhen Xie(Famous Curator) VS.

The invisible tradition could not be cast away while the western culture was brought in, leading the social development with modernism. To combine the traditional cotton print with western commercial images, she showed her embarrassment under such circumstance. In her creations afterwards, Wu started to care for life, existence and environment of herself and her surroundings. \\"Snack wrappings\\" or computer games were painted on cotton print to show her life and what she felt. Besides, her frustration and pressure while working as a teacher in a university in Beijing was also implied in her art works.

This included commodities such as rice, pepper, salt, exotic spices, tea and most importantly coffee. It was only at the turn of the century, around the year 1900, that the enterprise decided to develop a coffee roasting business under the Miko brand name as its main activity. Throughout the remaining part of the 19th century as well early part of the 20th Michielsen Koffie (as it was known) passed down from generation to generation until in 1937 a large plot of redundant farmland was acquired on the outskirts of Turnhout, a small Belgian town close to the Belgian/Dutch border. This was a significant turning point in the history of Michielsen Koffie and with it came the new shortened trading name of Miko. ‚ÄúMi‚Äù for Michielsen and ‚ÄúKo‚Äù for ‚ÄúKoffie! In fact Miko remains the trading name right up until today. The three brothers running the business during the 1930s (Jan, Frans and Johan) did not envisage what was to follow and as Europe descended into War difficult times followed. However with lots of hard work and creativity Miko managed to survive this difficult period in world history! One of the ideas which kept the business alive during the war years was the decision to start roasting ‚Äúacorns‚Äù just like coffee beans; it made Miko the creator of ‚ÄúAcorn Coffee.‚Äù This bitter, black derivative also known as ‚Äúsurrogate coffee‚Äù was drunk in large volumes throughout the war years. To be frank nothing else and better was available! The period after the war was great for coffee, (no surprise after drinking acorns) and the boom years which followed quickly accelerated Miko's presence on the European coffee stage. Miko was now at the fore of all new coffee innovation, which included; Being the first to pack coffee into waterproof inner sachets pioneering the development of ground and vacuum packed coffee Being the first to launch the one cup filter concept (World Exposition, 1958) In addition Miko added creative flair to their advertising by using retired world war zeppelins to promote their coffee brand across the many coastal regions of Northern Europe. The next significant landmark in the Miko history was in 1970 when the company reconsidered their position in the European coffee trade and decided to channel all future resource into the ‚Äúout of home‚Äù market rather than join the already saturated retail industry. A strategy that remains at the core of today's business plan. The product innovation, which followed, clearly separated Miko from the other major European coffee players. It led to the launch of the catering pot filter (a pre dosed 12 cup filter) and more recently the exciting new pouch pack concept. In 1975 and following the success of Miko concepts in the ‚Äúout of home market‚Äù a call centre was established in Brussels to deal with the growing number of direct coffee service customers. When launched this operation employed a handful of people. Today the same business employs over 100 skilled coffee service individuals dedicated at making Miko the number one name in Coffee Service. The seventies was therefore a crucial period in the history of Miko coffee. In the eighties diversification was the key word. A logical step in this process was to start assembling professional coffee machines in Turnhout. Miko therefore set up a separate but related business known as Mepaco, whose priority was to assemble coffee machines. This operation continues today, successfully supporting the coffee division of the Miko group. In fact Miko is one of a handful of coffee companies throughout the world, which can not only roast coffee but also manufactures coffee making equipment. The final milestone in the Miko history was its launch on the Brussels stock exchange in 1998. The objective being to inject the necessary finance to fulfil all future business objectives.

The glacier lies on the exposed north-facing slopes in the upper Blaueis cirque, nestling between the rock faces of the Blaueisspitze (2480 m), Hochkalter (2607 m) and Kleinkalter (2513 m), which ring the glacier in a horseshoe shape. Because of its relatively low elevation, the Blaueis has been particularly affected by glacial retreat which is common amongst Alpine glaciers. Since the mid-1980s, rocks in the middle of the Blaueis have become increasingly free of snow and the upper part of the glacier is now more or less completely separated from the lower field of what is now dead ice. The thickness of the ice as determined by ground-penetrating radar was only up to 13 feet in 2007, and the average thickness of the ice was less than four metres; giving a volume of around 0.4 million m¬≥.Archive of Bavarian Glaciers This means that the remaining ice mass is smaller than the mass lost in the last decade of the 20th century. The base for ascents of the glacier is the Blaueis Hut at 1,680 m high in the Blaueis cirque below the glacier. The hut may be reached from Ramsau or Hintersee in just over three hours walking. Above the glacier, which in its upper section is up to 55¬∞ steep, is a climbing path to the Blaueis gap (2,400 m), from which there is an easy climb of grade II (UIAA) to the Hochkalter summit. The best time of the year is usually the second half of June, when snow still facilitates the climb and snow bridges often allow a simple crossing of the gully (Randkluft) below the saddle. In late summer and autumn, the gully is wide and often difficult to cross. At that time of the year there were sometimes fatal falls in the past caused by black ice. A popular climbing tour is the so-called Blaueisumrahmung (Blaueis circuit). It runs without touching the glacier from the Blaueis Hut over the Sch√§rtenspitze, Blaueisspitze, Hochkalter, Kleinkalter and Rotpalfen back to the start. The main difficulty is conquering the Blaueis north ar√™te, which is at least a UIAA grade IV climb.

It also continues to set a high moral tone and the government takes advantage of this to pursue its objectives, particularly in the effort to create the Vietnamese \\"new society.\\" Family life, hence, reflects influences of traditional Vietnamese values, the French colonial past, and state interventions.  Kinship system  By tradition, the head of the Vietnamese family (Vietnamese: gia ƒë√¨nh or nh√†) is the husband, named gia tr∆∞·ªüng. Many families which have the same origin compose a \\"line of the blood\\", called ƒë·∫°i gia ƒë√¨nh or gia t·ªôc or h·ªç. The head of a ƒë·∫°i gia ƒë√¨nh is the man who is at the highest status in the ƒë·∫°i gia ƒë√¨nh, named t·ªôc tr∆∞·ªüng. According to the Vietnamese creation myth, all Vietnamese people descend from two progenitors L·∫°c Long Qu√¢n and √Çu C∆°. Nine generations (Vietnamese: th·∫ø h·ªá or ƒë·ªùi) are recognized in terms, including: K·ªµ (K·ªµ √¥ng/ K·ªµ b√†) : my great-grandparents' parents (my great-grandparents' father/mother) C·ª• (C·ª• √¥ng/ C·ª• b√†) : my great- grandparents (my great-grandfather/great grandmother) √îng b√† : my grandparents (my grandfather/grandmother) Cha M·∫π : my parents (father/mother) Ta/T√¥i : I Con (Con trai/Con g√°i) : my children (my son/daughter) Ch√°u (Ch√°u trai/Ch√°u g√°i) : my grandchildren (my grandson/granddaughter) Ch·∫Øt (Ch·∫Øt trai/ch·∫Øt g√°i): my great-grandchildren My great-grandson/great-granddaughter) Ch√∫t (or Ch√≠t)(Ch√∫t trai/Ch√∫t g√°i): my great-grandchildren's children (my great- grandchildren's son/daughter) Usually, there are three generations are in co- residence, called tam ƒë·∫°i ƒë·ªìng ƒë∆∞·ªùng. Horizontally, there are brothers/sisters that share our same parent, named anh ch·ªã em ru·ªôt and cousins who share the same grandparents, named anh ch·ªã em h·ªç. The adopted brothers/sisters are anh ch·ªã em nu√¥i. The half-brother/sisters who share the same father but different mothers are anh ch·ªã em d·ªã b√†o and the half-brothers/sisters who share the same mother but different fathers are anh ch·ªã em ƒë·ªìng m·∫´u d·ªã ph·ª•. The husband of the sisters are anh/em r·ªÉ and the wife of the brothers are ch·ªã/em d√¢u. The brothers/sisters of the husband are anh ch·ªã em ch·ªìng and the brothers/sisters of our wife are anh ch·ªã em v·ª£. Two men whose wives are sisters are anh em c·ªçc ch√®o and two women whose husbands are brothers are ch·ªã em d√¢u.  Parents  There are three types of fathers (Vietnamese: tam ph·ª•) and eight types of mothers (Vietnamese: b√°t m·∫´u). * Tam ph·ª• are: Th√¢n ph·ª•: our blood-father. Gi√° ph·ª• or cha d∆∞·ª£ng or cha gh·∫ª: our mother's present husband D∆∞·ª°ng ph·ª•: our adopted father. * B√°t m·∫´u are: ƒê√≠ch m·∫´u: our father's official first wife. K·∫ø m·∫´u: our father's wife who replace the position of k·∫ø m·∫´u in case that k·∫ø m·∫´u has died. D∆∞·ª°ng m·∫´u: our adopted mother, does not belong to our family.

Xu·∫•t m·∫´u: our blooded mother, who has divorced or separated from our blood-father. Nh≈© m·∫´u: our wetnurse (i.e. an unrelated woman who breastfed them) Children must follow their parents' instructions and accept their restrictions. This principle is named ƒë·∫°o hi·∫øu.  Marriage  See also Traditional Vietnamese wedding An engagement ceremony usually takes place half a year or so before the wedding. In the past, most marriages (Vietnamese: h√¥n nh√¢n) were arranged by the parents or extended family, and while children were sometimes consulted, it was nearly always the parents' final decision. It was not unusual for the bride and groom to meet for the first time at the day of their engagement. However, in the last few decades, Vietnamese women and men marry based on love rather than arranged marriages. This level of freedom is attributed to the influence of the French during Vietnam's colonization.  Name  A Vietnamese name consists of three components, h·ªç, t√™n ƒë·ªám, and t√™n g·ªçi. H·ªç is the name of the person's line of blood. T√™n ƒë·ªám is the person's middle name. T√™n is the person's given name.  Personal pronoun Vietnamese personal pronouns are formed according to the position of the speakers and listeners in their families.  House  Vietnamese nuclear families usually live together in the same house. Matured and married children cannot live independently without the permission of their parents. Therefore, in Vietnamese language, the word for house: nh√† also means family.  Role of the state  The Vietnamese government plays a strong role in the family life of its citizens. This follows the idea that the family is one of the most important factors when addressing threats such as what the state referred to as \\"social evils\\" (e.g. drug use, prostitution, and HIV/AIDS). A guideline released in 1995, for instance, prescribes that everyone maintains \\"clean, healthy, and faithful lifestyle.\\" The state also exerted its authority when the economic reform called ƒê·ªïi M·ªõi was adopted and it included a restrictive reproductive policy. The position was that, for sound, medical and material reasons, Vietnamese families will attain happiness (hanh phuc) if they follow family planning, among other state recommendations.

These types of compositions include: symphony, concerto, sonata, and standard chamber music combinations (string strio, quartet, quintet, sextet, etc.; piano trio, quartet, quintet, sextet, etc.), among others. A sub-title is a subsidiary name given to a work by the composer, and considered part of its formal title, such as: * The Age of Anxiety, the sub- title of Bernstein's Symphony No. 2 * Path√©tique, the sub-title of Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6 in B minor, Op. 74. A nickname is a name that is not part of the title given by the composer, but has come to be popularly associated with the work, such as: * Emperor, the nickname of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 in E-flat major, Op. 73 * Jupiter, the nickname of Mozart's Symphony No. 41 in C major, K. 551. A non-numeric title is a formal title that departs from the usual sequential numbering of works of the same type, such as: * Symphonie fantastique by Berlioz and * Warsaw Concerto by Addinsell. Background Many classical compositions belong to a numbered series of works of a similar type by the same composer. For example, Beethoven wrote 9 symphonies, 10 violin sonatas, 32 piano sonatas, 5 piano concertos, 16 string quartets, 7 piano trios and other works, all of which are numbered sequentially within their genres and generally referred to by their sequence numbers, keys and opus numbers. For example, the 6th of his violin sonatas is referred to as: Violin Sonata No. 6 in A major, Op. 30, No. 1. However, some of these works were also given descriptive sub-titles by Beethoven himself: for example, he sub-titled the 3rd Symphony \\"Eroica\\", and the 6th Symphony \\"Pastoral\\". Others were given nicknames by publishers or others: for example, the Piano Sonata No. 14 is called \\"Moonlight\\" and the Piano Trio No. 7 is known as the \\"Archduke\\". In other cases, a composer gives a work a title without any number, even though he may have written other works of that type with numbers. For example, Tchaikovsky wrote 6 numbered symphonies, but he also wrote the unnumbered Manfred Symphony between the 4th and 5th symphonies. A listing of all Tchaikovsky's symphonies would be incomplete without mention of the Manfred Symphony. Special cases Works such as Vaughan Williams's first three symphonies (A Sea Symphony, A London Symphony and A Pastoral Symphony) fit into more than one camp. These are true titles, as Vaughan Williams commenced the numbering of his symphonies only from his 4th Symphony. The first three symphonies were, however, retrospectively given numbers by cataloguers. Hence, A Sea Symphony, for example, is often referred to as his \\"Symphony No. 1\\", with the original title being relegated to a sub-title, although that was never Vaughan Williams's own intention or practice. Other named works excluded There are vast numbers of other named compositions that do _not_ qualify for this list. Symphonic poems, concert overtures, suites, variations, operas, ballets, most vocal and choral music, and miscellaneous other works are normally given titles that exclude numbers. Examples of such works would include: * Thus Spoke Zarathustra, symphonic poem by Richard Strauss * Tragic Overture by Brahms * Schelomo, Hebraic rhapsody by Bloch * The Planets, Suite by Holst * Sea Pictures, song cycle by Elgar * Messiah, oratorio by Handel * La boh√®me, opera by Puccini * Carnaval, a set of piano pieces by Schumann List of sub-titles, nicknames and non-numeric titles A * A: Joseph Haydn, Symphony No. 107 in B-flat major, Hob.

USA also covered the early rounds of The Masters Tournament from 1982 until 2007. The network also carried the Ryder Cup Matches in some form from 1989 until 2010, except for the 2008 event. Coverage overview USA was also, separately, the cable home of the Masters Tournament from 1982 to 2007. USA's sister network, Universal HD, broadcast The Masters in high-definition (one of the first golf tournaments to ever hold that distinction). The Masters Tournament The USA Network began first and second round Masters coverage in 1982, Ratings For Each Round of The Masters Since '82 (First/Second Rounds Since '99) which was also produced by the CBS production team. This was the first ever cable coverage for one of the golf majors. Initially, the USA Network provided Thursday and Friday coverage for 2 hours live each day along with a prime time replay. In 1995, USA expanded the Thursday/Friday coverage to 2.5 hours each day. In 2003 and 2004, both CBS and USA televised the Masters commercial-free. In 2005, USA increased the Thursday/Friday coverage to 3 hours. Other events covered by USA The Shark Shootout, which began in 1989 as the RMCC Invitational, was originally broadcast in the United States by the USA Network and CBS, with USA broadcasting the first round on a tape-delayed basis, and CBS handling the second round live. Not all the country saw the final round live, as CBS' commitment to the NFL only allowed part of the country to see the round as it takes place, with the rest of the U.S. seeing the event beginning at 4 p.m. Eastern Time. In 2007, the event was moved to December, and was broadcast live by both Golf Channel and NBC. *Bob Hope Chrysler Classic - From 2003‚Äì06, USA Network covered the early action. Prior to 2007, USA and ESPN/ABC consistently covered all four courses used for the event, with the primary camera crew covering PGA West, but live coverage still emanating from the other courses. However, when Golf Channel took over coverage, the network only assigned live coverage to PGA West (both the Palmer and Nicklaus courses). All other courses used did not receive live coverage at all, with an hourly highlights package sent in and played, but none of it live. This has been the approach consistently taken by Golf Channel in regards to tournaments with multiple courses, including the Pebble Beach National Pro- Am and the Walt Disney World Golf Classic. However, since NBC has taken over the production of PGA Tour events on Golf Channel, coverage of all courses on multi-course events has returned. *Buick Invitational *FBR Open *AT&T; Pebble Beach Nat'l Pro-Am *Nissan Open *Chrysler Classic of Tucson *Ford Championship at Doral *Honda Classic *Bay Hill Invitational presented by MasterCard *BellSouth Classic *Verizon Heritage *Shell Houston Open *Zurich Classic of New Orleans *Wachovia Championship *EDS Byron Nelson Championship *Bank of America Colonial *Senior PGA Championship *FedEx St. Jude Classic *Barclays Classic *Booz Allen Classic *Buick Championship *Cialis Western Open *Ford Senior Players Championship *John Deere Classic *B.C.

NBC/Universal, parent company of USA Network, traded away the network's Friday Ryder Cup coverage through 2012 to ESPN for the rights to sign Al Michaels. However, USA did renew its Masters contract for an additional year. USA would televise the 2007 Masters before being outbid by ESPN for future coverage. The 2007 Masters was also the final event for USA Sports, which was dissolved into parent NBC Sports after the tournament. All future sports telecasts on USA would use NBC's graphics and personalities. The Ryder Cup contract, which stipulated cable coverage air on USA, was still controlled by NBC even after it granted ESPN the rights to Friday cable coverage (normally the only day of the event covered on cable). However, in 2010, rain on Friday pushed the singles matches to Monday, necessitating that they air on cable. With NBC having granted only Friday rights to ESPN, the singles matches aired on USA, which would be the final golf telecast for the network. Four months later, NBC merged with Golf Channel, making Golf Channel NBC's primary cable outlet for golf.

The book was prepared for the press by Thomas Paynell, also a canon of Merton, and was printed by James Nicholson at Southwark. Its probable date is 1537. This first edition is more complete than a later one, which omits the tables for the calculation of dimensions. Later life The name Benese occurs as the holder of the following benefices and dignities, but whether this represents two or more different persons is uncertain. Evidence linking them is circumstantial. #Clerk in the diocese of Hereford, 1514 #Parson of Woodborough, Sarum diocese 1511 to 1515 #Precentor of Hereford, 11 Nov. 1538 to end of 1546 #Prebendary of Farrendon, Line., 20 April 1542 #Parson of Longlednam, Lincolnshire #Rector of Long Ditton, Surrey, 11 Feb. 1542 #Rector of All Hallows, Honey Lane, 11 Oct. 1540. The church of Long Ditton was in the patronage of Merton Priory, and that the next rector of All Hallows was Thomas Paynell, the editor of Benese's book, suggesting that these two benefices were held by the same person. The precentor of Hereford also died at the end of 1546, about the same time as the rector of Long Ditton. But the will of the rector of Long Ditton (Alen. 31, 47), dated 3 Nov. 1546, and proved 20 Oct. 1547, says nothing of the testator's holding other benefices. A brother, Edward, and a sister, Elizabeth, married to Ric. Skynner, are mentioned in the will.

On 10 July 2002, the flight was unable to land at Fuhlsb√ºttel Airport due to weather. Attempts were made to divert to other airports at Berlin and Eberswalde before the crew decided to land at Werneuchen. On landing, the aircraft struck an earth bank which ripped off all three undercarriage legs, and came to rest on its belly with an engine on fire. One of the sixteen passengers suffered minor injuries. The aircraft was written off. The investigation into the accident by the German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation (BFU) took over eight years to complete. It raised a number of issues, including poor crew resource management, insufficient weather information being passed to the crew of Flight 850 and faulty runway markings at Werneuchen Airfield, where the runway had been reduced in length from to , but the runway markings had not been altered to reflect this. Aircraft The aircraft involved was a Saab 2000, registered HB-IZY, and named Doldenhorn, after a mountain in Switzerland. The aircraft was msn 047 and had first flown on 30 April 1997. At the time of the accident, it had completed 12,303 hours of flight and made 12,069 landings. Accident All times are UTC (Zulu Time), local time was two hours ahead of UTC. Flight 850 was originally scheduled to be operated by an Embraer 145 aircraft. Due to the non-availability of the Embraer 145, a Saab 2000 was substituted, and the briefing for the flight was extended by 15 minutes. Actual departure was at 14:55 UTC, 10 minutes behind schedule. It carried four crew and 16 passengers. Weather reports indicated a line of thunderstorms, winds up to could be expected at Fuhlsb√ºttel and the designated alternatives of Hannover and Bremen. A number of SIGMETs were issued about an hour before the flight departed Basel, but the flight crew did not receive these. The SIGMETs indicated a front was developing with thunderstorms reaching FL380 in the Bremen area. The Terminal Aerodrome Forecast for Fuhlsb√ºttel Airport, Hamburg valid from 13:00 to 22:00 was: TAF EDDH 101200Z 101322 31010KT 9999 FEW025 TEMPO 1320 29020G40KT 3000 TSRA BKN013CB Tempo 1922 4000 RA BKN014.Terminal Aerodrome Forecast for Fuhlsb√ºttel Airport, issued on the 10th of the month at 12:00 Zulu Time, valid on the 10th of the month between 13:00 and 22:00 Zulu Time.

Temporarily between 19:00 and 22:00 Zulu Time visibility in rain, broken clouds at 1,400 ft. Runway 23 was the active runway at Fuhlsb√ºttel. On approach to land, the flight encountered severe turbulence due to a thunderstorm and the crew aborted the approach as the aircraft descended through . It was later established that a derecho had formed. Winds of were recorded, and seven people were killed in the Berlin area. The storm was described as the worst summer storm in 50 years in Berlin. The crew decided to hold while they assessed their alternatives. The designated alternative airport was Bremen Airport, some to the south-west. To reach Bremen would have meant flying through the frontal system. Another aircraft successfully landed on Runway 33 at Hamburg, reporting strong winds. The crew of Flight 850 declined to attempt a landing on Runway 23, and requested a diversion to Langenhagen Airport, Hannover. Air Traffic Control (ATC) did not suggest any other alternatives, nor were they requested by the crew. En route, the frontal system prevented the crew from turning towards Hannover. A decision was made to divert to Tegel Airport, Berlin. The Automatic Terminal Information Service at Tegel stated that the weather there was clear and no significant change was expected. Approaching Tegel's Runway 08L, the crew requested priority handling, stating that they had fuel for 40 minutes flight. On approach, severe turbulence was again encountered due to the frontal system having reached Berlin. The approach was abandoned and the crew requested an alternate airfield from ATC. Eberswalde Airfield was suggested and accepted by the crew, who stated \\"We'll take anything at this point\\". On hearing this remark, ATC treated the aircraft's situation as an emergency. En route to Eberswalde, thunderstorms were observed and alternates were sought from ATC. Hamburg ATC then offered Neubrandenburg Airport, which was rejected by the crew of Flight 850 on receiving the weather information. Werneuchen Airfield was then offered, which was away and offered a runway long. Werneuchen was accepted by the crew. ATC managed to contact the chairman of the flying club based at Werneuchen. He stated that the runway surface was long, but an earth bank stretched across the runway leaving available. Landing on Runway 08 meant that the first part of the runway fell before the earth bank. Almost an hour after aborting the approach to Fuhlsb√ºttel, Flight 850 began its approach to Werneuchen. The crew reported that they were visual with the runway and were advised by Werneuchen ATC that they needed to land on the eastern part of Runway 08. When Flight 850 turned onto its final approach, the captain remarked that the runway was \\"longer than Berne\\", and told the first officer to land wherever he wanted. Although the closed off part of the runway had been marked as such, the markings had weathered severely over the years, meaning that the original markings were easier to see than those that actually applied. Fading light and a lack of runway lighting contributed to the inability of the crew to see the earth bank. The first officer landed the aircraft at what appeared to be the runway threshold. It then came in contact with the earth bank which ripped off all three undercarriage legs and the aircraft slid to a halt on its belly. The fire alarm for the port engine sounded, and the crew performed fire drills on both engines. One female passenger injured her leg. The wrecked aircraft was initially stored but was later declared damaged beyond economic repair and was subsequently scrapped. Investigation The German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Investigation (BFU) opened an investigation into the accident, which was to take 3,005 days (over eight years) to complete. It found that a combination of factors caused the accident. Had the crew received the SIGMETs, the BFU considers it is likely that the crew would have realised that the thunderstorms were not isolated, but part of a system, and therefore made different decisions to those that they did. The METARs for both Tegel and Sch√∂nefeld airports showed CAVOK and NOSIG, the latter element was criticised by the BFU. At 17:50, this METAR was issued at Tegel Airport: EDDT 04001KT CAVOK 30/17 Q1002 A2959 0998 2947 NOSIG.METAR for Tegel Airport, wind from 040¬∞ at , Ceiling and Visibility OK, QNH 1002 HPa, current altimeter setting 29.59 in.Hg, falling to 998 HPa, 29.47 in.Hg, NO SIGnificant change expected. At the time, the cold front was south west of Tegel, and had moved in the previous hour. The BFU was of the opinion that NOSIG should not have been in the METAR, and that a SPECI would have been required. At 18:20, a new METAR was issued at Tegel: EDDT VRB01KT 9999 FEW040CB SCT120 BKN260 29/17 Q1002 A2959 0998 2947 TEMPO 27025G55KT 2000 +TSRA BKN009 BKN015CB COMMENTS: OCNL LTNG AND CB SW OF STN.METAR for Tegel Airport.

The decision to abort the approach to Fuhlsb√ºttel was supported by the BFU, but not the decision to divert to Hannover. The decision to divert to Tegel was supported by the BFU, based on the incorrect information given to the crew of CAVOK and NOSIG at Tegel. On approach to Werneuchen, ATC did not use correct terminology. It also found that the runway markings at Werneuchen did not conform to the required standard.

Units of the Air Service are listed as assigned to the order of battle for that date, which was that of the Armistice with Germany. The first air unit arrived in France in September 1917, while the final air unit reaching the front did so on November 9, 1918. Unit operations began in April 1918. At the armistice, 57,508 officers and men served in the Air Service of the AEF, 24,512 in the Zone of Advance (combat area), and 32,996 in the Services of Supply (rear areas). Of its 6,861 officers, 4,088 were on flying status and 219 were qualified observation balloon aviators. 1,724 of those on flying status and approximately 100 of the balloonists served in combat units., pp. 385-386. 574 other members of the Air Service were with the British Expeditionary Force and 8 with the French armies. The First Army Air Service was activated August 26, 1918, with Col. Benjamin Foulois named chief over Col. Billy Mitchell. The Second Army Air Service was activated on October 12 with Col. Frank P. Lahm as chief, and the Third Army Air Service was created immediately after the armistice to provide aviation support to the army of occupation, primarily from veteran units transferred from the First Army Air Service. The first two air combat groups formed in the AEF were the 1st Corps Observation Group, in April 1918, and the 1st Pursuit Group at Toul. Ultimately fourteen airplane and seven balloon groups were formed to support the operations of two field armies and five corps. The five pursuit and two bombardment groups were organized into two wings. The seven observation and seven balloon groups had one of each assigned to an army or corps air service. Two flexible \\"observation wings\\" were created to coordinate the reconnaissance activities of the five corps air services. The basic units of the air service were the squadron for powered aircraft and the company for balloons. 45 squadrons (38 of which conducted combat operations) of aircraft and 17 companies of balloons served at the front. The 20 pursuit and seven bombardment squadrons were authorized 25 aircraft (including spares) and 18 crews each by the Field Service Regulations, while the 18 observation squadrons were each authorized 24 planes and 18 crews. Balloon companies were equipped with one balloon and approximately six observers each.

The First Army Air Service dates to the first American Air Service personnel arriving in France. On 15 January 1918, Colonel William Mitchell was appointed Chief of the Air Service, I Corps, First Army. At this time, the I Corps was being formed for the purpose of administratively handling all of the American troops then on the Western Front. Headquarters was located at Neufch√¢teau, France. When the first American Aero Squadrons arrived at the front in April 1918, they were assigned to the quiet Toul Sector. At this time, the American Air Service on the front consisted of only a few Aero Squadrons of the 1st Pursuit Group.Series \\"C\\", Volume 1, Early history of Air Service commands at the Front.

It consisted of the French Aerial Division, which consisted of a large number of pursuit and day bombardment squadrons. In addition, there was one other French pursuit group and three American pursuit groups-one American day-bombardment group-the 1st Army observation, and one French Army artillery group for the adjustment of long-range artillery fire. Eight night-bombardment squadrons of the British Royal Air Force. were to cooperate with the First Army Air Service whenever the tactical situation made such action expedient.

Paragraph 170 appointed Colonel Frank P. Lahm as Chief of Air Service, Second Army, thus establishing a separate Air Service organization. Headquarters was established at Croix-de-Metz Aerodrome, Toul, France. As a result of the Armistice with Germany, American occupation forces would be sent to the German Rhineland. The Third Army Air Service, under the command of Brigadier General William Mitchell was organized on 14 November as the Air Service component of Third Army. First and Second Army Air Services were ordered to transfer some of their units at the front to Third Army as part of its organization, along with personnel from their Headquarters staffs along with the required equipment, ranging from office furniture to airplanes. The 5th Pursuit Group was transferred to Third Army on 19 November, along with the 41st, 138th and 638th Aero Squadrons.Series \\"D\\", Weekly Statistical Reports of Air Service Activities, October 1918-May 1919.

As a result, the Third Army Air Service was augmented with some of the few squadrons remaining in France. The Third Army Air Service's pursuit squadrons were consolidated at Coblenz. The 1st Aero Squadron and the remaining observation squadrons were consolidated at Weissenthurm and formed the III Corps Observation Group. The IV Corps Observation Group consisted of only the 85th Aero Squadron at Sinzing. The VII Corps Observation Group was at Trier.Series \\"P\\", Volumes 1 and 2, History of the 3d Army Air Service.

In July 1920, it was decided to add an Air Service organization to the forces of the AFG, and on 23 July a detachment of officers and men were deployed to Germany, under the command of Major Frank M. Andrews.Davis, James G. (1921), Review of the American Forces in Germany. Published in Coblenz, Germany, September 1921 They were not assigned to any specific Aero Squadron, but to the AFG directly. The Air Service personnel were established at Weissenthurm, south of Coblenz on the Rhine River. A new aerodrome was established, and some Bessonneau hangars were erected and quarters were established for personnel and offices. The contingent was equipped with 24 De Havilland DH.4 aircraft, powered by American Liberty engines.Barnes, Alexander F., Coblenz 1919: The Army‚Äôs First Sustainment Center of Excellence, Army Sustainment, The Professional Bulletin of United States Army Sustainment, PB 700-10-05, Volume 42, Issue 05 In March 1921, Army Engineers had erected facilities on the airfield and the Americans were moved to the airfield from the temporary facilities they occupied in the town during the winter. Occupation duties included all sorts and types of flying, such as test flights, photos of radio telegraph and radio telephone missions, joint flights with infantry, cavalry and artillery units during the winter and spring maneuvers, cross country flights and passenger carrying. A significant amount of aerial photography was taken for cartographic missions, and large mosaics of photos were created. The postwar occupation mission was not popular with the American people, nor with the Americans sent to Germany, nor with the Germans. In 1922, President Harding began withdrawing American forces from the Rhineland. All AFG aviation activities were shut down in April and all of the excess equipment was disposed of through sales. On 24 January 1923, the last American forces departed from Germany, leaving Coblenz to the French, formally ending the United States involvement in World War I.

Biography Portrait of his daughter Emma Jane, 1815 Hodges was a pupil of John Raphael Smith and had visited Amsterdam in 1788; after a two-year stay in Dublin, he moved with his family to The Hague in 1792. In 1797, he and his family moved to Amsterdam, where he lived with his teacher Johann Friedrich August Tischbein at the Prinsengracht N¬∞ 205. In Amsterdam, he worked as an artist, specialized in the mezzotint technique he had learned in England and the pastel technique he learned from Tischbein. There, he became a famous painter of portraits; he painted over 700 portraits of the rich and famous of that time. He was also an engraver, printer, art dealer and a member of the Amsterdam art club Felix Meritis. He is well known for the fact that he painted all the leaders of the Netherlands during the Napoleonic Period ‚Äì a turbulent time in Dutch history, since the Netherlands went through five different political systems: stadtholder Willem V of the Republic of the United Netherlands, Grand Pensionary Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck of the Batavian Republic, King Louis Bonaparte (King of Holland), Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte and king William I of the Netherlands. The only known portrait of Sebald Justinus Brugmans was made by him. A design for the honorary cross of the Order of the Union was rejected by Louis Bonaparte. In 1815 Hodges advised the Dutch government on the return of thousands of works of art, which were confiscated by the French in 1795 from several collections, including the Gallery of Prince William V (the first museum open to the public in the Netherlands), and the several collections of the previous stadtholders. Not all the stolen art was returned from Paris, and it is said that several pieces are still held in the Louvre up to this day. Most of the over 700 portraits by Hodges are made in the early 19th century, the earlier works in pastel, and later work in oil paint.450 works are registered in the RKD Several of these portraits can be found in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, in museums and castles and in royal and private collections. Charles Howard Hodges was teacher to his children Emma Jane Hodges and James Newman Hodges. James became a painter who worked in the Rijksmuseum when it was still located in the Trippenhuis in Amsterdam. Charles' pupils besides his children were Frederik Christiaan Bierweiler, William Fleming, Lambertus Johannes Hansen, Cornelis Kruseman, Joachim Jan Oortman, Petrus Antonius Ravelli, and Francesco Tozelli.

In 1451, more than 65 years after its initial attacks, the Ottoman Empire officially established the Bosansko Kraji≈°te, an interim borderland military administrative unit, an Ottoman frontier, in parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.Ibrahimagiƒá, 1998, p. 77 More than 50 years passed between the first Ottoman attack and the establishment of \\"Bosansko kraji≈°te\\" as an interim form of military and territorial organisation of Ottoman rule in Bosnia (1451)(22). [...] 22. ≈†abanoviƒá, Bosanski pa≈°aluk, str. 35. In 1463, the Kingdom fell to the Ottomans, and this territory came under its firm control. Herzegovina gradually fell to the Ottomans by 1482. It took another century for the western parts of today's Bosnia to succumb to Ottoman attacks, ending with the capture of Bihaƒá in 1592. Origins and etymology The entire territory that is today known as Bosnia and Herzegovina was not conquered by Ottoman Empire at once, in a single battle; rather, it took the Ottoman Empire several decades to conquer it. Military units of the Ottoman Empire made many raids into feudal principalities in the western Balkans at the end of the 14th century, some of them into territory of today's Bosnia and Herzegovina, long before the conquest of the Bosnian Kingdom. The first Ottoman raids led by Timurtash-Pasha happened in eastern parts of Bosnia in 1384. The Battle of Bileƒáa in 1388 was the first battle of the Ottoman army on the territory of today's Bosnia and Herzegovina. It soon won important victories against the regional feudal lords in the Battle of Marica (1371) and Battle of Kosovo (1389). In 1392, the Ottomans established the Skopsko Kraji≈°te following the capture of Skopje, the capital of the Serbian Empire between 1346-1371; the term ' () had originally served as an administrative unit of the Serbian Empire or Despotate to designate border regions where the emperor or despot had not established solid and firm control due to raids from hostile neighboring provinces. The militarized territories that would later receive the name Bosansko Kraji≈°te (lit. Bosnian Frontierland) were thus governed by the same Ottoman administration, based in Skopje. War with the Bosnian Kingdom After the death of King Tvrtko I in 1391, the Bosnian Kingdom went into decline. In the 1410s, local noblemen Hrvoje Vukƒçiƒá of the House of Hrvatiniƒá, Sandalj Hraniƒá of the House of Kosaƒça and Pavle Radenoviƒá of the House of Pavloviƒá controlled large swaths of territory once controlled by Tvrtko, and effectively controlled the Kingdom by aligning themselves with competing branches of the House of Kotromaniƒá. In 1413, a conflict escalated between Hrvoje and Sandalj while the latter was helping Stefan Lazareviƒá fight the Ottomans in Serbia; subsequently, Hrvoje allied himself with the Ottomans, who invaded Bosnia in May 1414, which prompted a subsequent invasion by the troops of the Kingdom of Hungary. In a major battle in August 1415 that took place either near Doboj or in the La≈°va Valley, the Ottomans won a major victory, upsetting the balance of power in the region. The first permanent presence of Ottoman armies in Bosnia was established in 1414, after the region near Donji Vakuf (known as Bosnian Skoplje in medieval times) was captured. In period between 1414 and 1418, the Ottoman Empire conquered Foƒça, Pljevlja, ƒåajniƒçe and Nevesinje. During the same year Vi≈°egrad and Sokol were captured too. In 1415, Sandalj Hraniƒá, who controlled today's eastern Herzegovina, became an Ottoman vassal. Isa-Beg Isakoviƒá organized in 1455 one of the first Ottoman censuses in the west Balkan territory. By the end of this period, in the 1460s, the territory of the Kingdom of Bosnia was significantly reduced, with the Ottoman Empire controlling the entirety of today's eastern Bosnia, as far north as ≈†amac, and Herceg Stjepan under control of all of today's Herzegovina as far north as Glamoƒç. Sanjaks The Ottoman conquest of the Kingdom of Bosnia ended in 1463 with the death of King Stjepan Toma≈°eviƒá. The Siege of Jajce ensued shortly thereafter, in which the Kingdom of Hungary retook the Jajce Fortress. That victory was hailed at Matthias Corvinus' court as a restoration of the Kingdom of Bosnia under Hungarian sovereignty at the time. The Hungarians formed the Banate of Jajce after that. The same year, Bosnian Kraji≈°te was transformed to Bosnian Sanjak and Isa-Beg Isakoviƒá was its first sanjakbey. After taking the Kingdom of Bosnia in 1463, Mahmud Pasha also invaded Herzegovina and besieged Blagaj, after which Herceg Stjepan conceded a truce that required ceding all of his lands north of Blagaj to the Empire. The Ottoman territory in Bosnia continued to be expanded into newly established sanjaks: the Sanjak of Herzegovina was formed in the 1470, subordinated to the beglerbey of Rumelia like the Bosnian sanjak. In 1480, the Sanjak of Zvornik was formed, but subordinated to the beglerbey of Budim. Even though the Bosnian Kingdom fell, there were several fortresses that resisted much longer - the last fortress in Herzegovina fell in 1481. The House of Kosaƒça maintained the Duchy of Saint Sava as an Ottoman vassal state until 1482. In 1481, after the death of Mehmed II, Matthias Corvinus invaded Bosnia again, reaching Vrhbosna (Sarajevo), but all of those gains were undone within a year. In the 1530s, the Kingdom of Hungary had remained in control of the forts on the south bank of the Sava, and Jajce. Jajce Fortress was finally taken by the Ottomans in 1527. The House of Berislaviƒá controlled the region of Usora in the north until it in turn succumbed in the 1530s. Parts of southwestern Bosnia were sectioned into the Sanjak of Klis formed in 1537, subordinated to the Eyalet of Rumelia. Aftermath The Eyalet of Bosnia was established in 1580.Ibrahimagiƒá, 1998, p. 77 And 117 years passed from the fall of Bosnia in 1463, when the first sanjak was established as the first independent form of military, administrative and political form of organisation of Ottoman rule in Bosnia, until the establishment of the Bosnian beglerbegluk or ayalet [province] as a separate province of the Ottoman Empire in 1580. It took until 1592 and the fall of Bihaƒá to reach westernmost frontiers of medieval Bosnian state, and the modern western border of Bosnia to be established. After that, the territory of modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina remained under largely undisturbed Ottoman rule until 1689 and the Great Turkish War.

Role in the Anglican realignment Nopece upholds the traditional Anglican stance on homosexuality and condemned the consecration in 2003 of Gene Robinson, the first non-celibate gay bishop of the Episcopal Church, as a defiant act to the Anglican Communion. In his official statement afterwards, he declared that \\"The consecration as bishop of Gene Robinson, a man living openly in a homosexual relationship with another man in blatant disregard for the teaching of Holy Scripture and the position of the Anglican Communion (expressed in Lambeth resolution 1;10 of 1998), is not an action to be celebrated, but a deep and grievous error to be mourned.\\" He also stated that \\"We want to emphasise that our protest is not against homosexually inclined persons, but rather against a section of Church leadership which, through this consecration, is attempting to change the fundamental teachings of the Christian faith.\\" He criticized Archbishop Njongonkulu Ndungane support for the consecration, stating that \\"The Archbishop of Cape Town has not spoken on behalf of the faithful of this Province, as he has not heard the mind of the Church fully through deliberations of its general councils and Synods on this issue.\\"Statement by Bishop Bethlehem Nopece Following Consecration of Gay Bishop, 9 November 2003, Christian News Nopece was the only South African bishop to attend the GAFCON meeting in Jerusalem in June 2008. In response to the Diocese of Cape Town resolution, passed on 22 August 2009, asking the Anglican Church of Southern Africa bishops to give pastoral guidelines for gay members of the church who lived in \\"covenanted partnerships\\", Nopece decided to launch the Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans in South Africa on 3 September 2009 at St. John's Church, Port Elizabeth. He hosted the event, which was attended by a retired Archbishop of Kenya, Benjamin Nzimbi, one of the GAFCON founding primates.

With 221 matches and 88 goals D√©zio Esteves belongs to the outstanding players in the history of Bangu with which he achieved 1951 the second place of the State Championship of Rio under the stewardship of the Uruguayan champion coach Ondino Viera. With coach Tim Bangu reached a third place in this competition in 1959.

Biography Early career Anstruther was the eldest son of Sir Robert Anstruther of Balcaskie, M.P., and Lady Janet Erskine, daughter of the Earl of Kellie, and was born in 1768. He was educated at Westminster School, but early showed a taste for a military life, and in 1788 his father purchased for him a commission as an ensign, and in 1792 the rank of lieutenant and captain in the 3rd Regiment of Foot ( The Scots Guards). He led the usual life of a young officer in the Guards, but at the same time paid great attention to his military duties. He served with his regiment in the campaigns of 1793 and 1794 in Flanders, and in 1796 was for a short time attached to the Austrian headquarters, but, seeing no further chance of active service in the Guards, he purchased, in March 1797, a majority, and in August of the same year a lieutenant-colonelcy in the 68th Regiment, with which he served in the West Indies, where he attracted the attention of Sir Ralph Abercromby. Campaigns in Holland and Egypt In August 1799, hearing that the guards were going on active service, he exchanged into his old regiment as captain and lieutenant- colonel, and served with it in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland. In the same year he married Miss Lucy Charlotte Hamilton, the daughter of Colonel Hamilton, of the Coldstream Guards, eldest son of Lord Anne Hamilton and a nephew of the Duke of Hamilton. The next year, though only a lieutenant- colonel, he was selected by Sir Ralph Abercromby to be quartermaster-general of his army in the Mediterranean, at the same time that another young Scotsman, John Hope, who was also to gain fame in Moore's retreat, was nominated adjutant-general. Sir Ralph placed the greatest confidence in Anstruther, and it was mainly on his report, after a visit to the Turkish headquarters, that the Turks would not be ready for a long time, if they could be of any use at all, that Sir Ralph left Marmorice Bay and determined to act alone. Through the whole Egyptian campaign he served with the greatest credit, and was made one of the first knights of the Crescent when the Sultan established that order. On his return he was promoted colonel, was made first deputy quartermaster-general in England, and then adjutant-general in Ireland, and spent some years of domestic happiness at home. But he failed in his attempt to obtain active employment, until, on the return of the Tories to power in 1807, he was appointed brigadier-general, and ordered to take command of a brigade, consisting of the 20th and 52nd Regiments, and four companies of the 95th or Rifle Regiment, which was about to sail to the assistance of Sir Arthur Wellesley in Portugal. Peninsular war He embarked at Ramsgate in August 1808, and, on reaching the mouth of the Douro in company with Brigadier-General Acland, found orders from General Wellesley to proceed at once down the coast to Maceira Bay. Wellesley himself had, after his success at Roli√ßa, marched along the coast, for he wished to receive reinforcements before he either attacked Lisbon or engaged Junot's whole army. At Paymayo and Maceira accordingly Anstruther and Acland met Wellesley and disembarked their brigades, though with much difficulty and loss from the heavy surf. When disembarked, Wellesley formed his whole army in a strong position at Vimeiro, and awaited the attack which Junot was meditating. At the battle of Vimeiro, the churchyard which formed the key of the English situation was occupied by the brigades of Fane and Anstruther, and on them fell the brunt of Junot's attack. The French were, however, repulsed with heavy loss, and Anstruther proved his ability as a brigadier. On the arrival of Moore, Burrard, and Dalrymple, the army was re-divided, and Anstruther had the other companies of the 95th given to him, and was put under the orders of Edward Paget, who was to command the reserve. On the advance into Spain, Paget led his brigades by way of Elvas and Alcantara, to join Moore at Salamanca. It was in the retreat from Salamanca, or rather from Toro, that Anstruther's most important military duties were performed. The reserve was ordered to form the rear division, and Anstruther's brigade actually closed the retreat. The conduct of the troops was now severely tried, but the reserve stood the test well. While the leading divisions were perpetually in disorder, the reserve, of which both officers and men had been trained by Sir John Moore himself at Shorncliffe, maintained perfect discipline, and in Anstruther's brigade served two of the regiments, the 52nd and 95th, which were to form the nucleus of the famous Light Division under Wellington. As far as Lugo, the French were never a day's march behind, every day saw sharp skirmishes, and there were at least two smart engagements at Cacabelos on 3 June and Constantino on 5 June, in which the reserve and cavalry were alone concerned. General Anstruther proved himself a model officer, and Moore declared that to the conduct of the reserve, and of Paget and Anstruther in particular, the safe arrival of the army at Corunna was due. But the exertions of this trying time were too much for General Anstruther, and on 14 January, the day but one after he had led his brigade into Corunna, and the day but one before the battle, he died from fatigue and exhaustion. He was buried at Corunna, and when Moore was himself dying, he expressed a wish to be buried beside his gallant friend and companion, so that the column erected by Marshal Soult over Moore's remains marks also the grave of Robert Anstruther. He presents a singular instance of military devotion; with wealth, domestic happiness, and a certain seat in parliament, he preferred to risk his life and lose it in the service of his country.

Early life and education Archer was the son of Henry Archer, Esq., of Coopersale, Theydon Garnon, Essex, by Anne, daughter of Simon Crouch, of London, alderman. He was educated at Queens' College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1619, and M.A. in 1622. Having entered Gray's Inn as a student in 1617, he was called to the bar in 1620. Career He appears to have risen very slowly in his profession, as his name is not mentioned by any of the reporters of the time of Charles I. Edward Foss states that 'in 1647 he was selected as counsel for the corporation of Grantham,' but cites no authority; and the corporation of Grantham does not appear as a party to any case reported in that year. In 1651 he was assigned by the court as one of the counsel for Christopher Love on his trial for high treason in plotting with the Scots to bring about the restoration of the monarchy; but exception was taken to Archer on the ground that he had not subscribed the engagement to be true to the commonwealth, as required by a resolution of the House of Commons passed on 11 October 1649, to be subscribed by public functionaries 'and by' all sergeants at law, counsellors, officers, ministers, and clerks, and all attorneys and solicitors.' As Archer had not subscribed, and at the trial declined to subscribe, this engagement, he was not allowed to plead. Whether he subsequently did so does not appear; but in 1656 he was returned to parliament, and his name does not appear in the list of the excluded members. On 27 November 1658 he was made a Serjeant, the appointment being confirmed by Charles II on 1 June 1660; but his elevation to the bench, which had occurred in the interim (15 May 1659), was thereby tacitly annulled. On 4 November 1663 he was made a justice of the common bench in succession to Sir Robert Hide (then raised to the chief justiceship of the same bench), and knighted. As a judge he travelled the western circuit with Sir J. Kelyng. His name occurs in the list of the judges who attended the meeting of the bench summoned in 1666 to confer upon the proper course to be taken in view of the impending trial of Lord Morley for murder by the House of Lords, a case still cited as an authority upon the distinction between murder and manslaughter. Archer is characterised by Roger North as one 'of whose abilities time hath kept no record unless in the sinister way,' as uncertain in his law and afraid of a long and intricate cause. He appears, however, to have held decided and sound opinions on the construction of his own patent; for when the king in the winter of 1661 attempted to remove him from his office he stood stoutly upon his right to hold it on the terms of the patent, 'quamdiu se bene gesserit,' and refused to surrender the patent without a writ of scire facias, the proper legal mode of procedure to annul a royal grant; but which was so little to the taste of the king that Archer continued, until his death, legally justice of the common bench, and in receipt of his salary as such, though relieved by royal prohibition from the performance of the duties of the office, which were discharged by Sir William Ellis. Personal life Archer married Mary, daughter of Sir George Savile, Bart., of Thornhill, Yorkshire, by whom he does not appear to have had any children. He later married Eleanor (Curzon), daughter to Sir John Curson, Baronet of Kedleston, Derbyshire, by whom he had one child, John, who died without issue, 7 November 1706, having by his will left the Coopersale estate in Essex to William Eyre of Gray's Inn, on condition that he married Eleanora Wrottesley (a niece of the testator), daughter to Sir Walter Wrottesley, 3rd Baronet, and assumed the name of Archer, which happened in due course. The Archers traced their descent from one Simon de Bois, who came to England with the Conqueror, of whom a namesake and lineal descendant changed his name to Archer at the bidding of Henry V on the occasion of a shooting match at Havering-atte-Bower, in which he displayed the same skill as had formerly done the king good service at Agincourt, the king at the same time granting him a pension of five marks yearly. There are some inaccuracies in Foss's account of Archer's parentage. Archer died in 1682, and was buried in Theydon Garnon churchyard, where a monument was raised to his memory.

Unknown origins Archer was court physician to King Charles II Of his origin nothing is certainly known; but he was probably an English Protestant born in Ireland, as he speaks of having been in practice in Dublin in 1660. Irish Catholics were not educated as physicians in the 17th century (see Statutes of Kilkenny and Irish Penal Laws.) He afterwards lived in London, and was styled 'Chymical Physitian in Ordinary to the King' (1671); afterwards, on his engraved portrait, he is called simply 'medicus in ordinario regi' (1684). He boasts that, on the favorable report of some of his patients, his majesty was pleased to command him 'to help some noble persons afflicted with a fistule.' He was never a member of, or in any way licensed by, the College of Physicians. In fact Archer, although a royal physician, was what would be called in these days an advertising quack. His book, 'Every Man his own Doctor,' purporting to be a manual of health, but really treating of various diseases, reputable and disreputable, especially the latter, was nothing but an advertisement. He promises marvelous cures by secret remedies, sold only by himself, and able even to insure immunity beforehand from the possible consequences of debauchery. It is written in a style at once prurient and hypocritical. The British Museum copy of this work has written on the fly- leaf, in a contemporary hand ‚Äî and probably a similar advertisement was written in every copy before it was sold ‚Äî the following notice: 'The author is to be spoke with at his chamber in a sadler's house over against the mewes gate next the Black Horse nigh Charing Cross; his bowers there are from eleven to five in the evening, at other times at his house in Knightsbridge.' Secretive Trader His only medicines were certain nostrums of his own preparation, 'to be had only from the author at his house in Winchester Street, near Gresham College,' and at prices which seem high. His books were also sold by himself. Archer's 'Secrets Disclosed, of Consumption, &c.;' is a book of the same stamp, and in part a repetition of the former. His 'Herbal' is worthless. The Odd Inventor Archer also boasts of three inventions‚Äî a vapour-bath, a new kind of oven and a chariot which enabled one horse to do the work of two. The only interest attaching to these discreditable works and their author is the singular fact that a man who might in the present day even be liable to prosecution, should in the reign of Charles II have enjoyed the status of the king's physician. The titles of his works, alluded to above, are: 1. 'Every Man his own Doctor, completed with an Herbal, &c.;' by John Archer, one of his Majesty's Physicians in Ordinary. 2nd edition.

Early life Moses was born in Washington, District of Columbia. He is the oldest son of advertising executive Richard Cantrell Moses, Sr. and Marian McCargo (1932‚Äì2004). Moses has three siblings; brothers Graham, Harry and Billy. He grew up in Pasadena, California where he showed an interest in wrestling, swimming, movies, and music. His mother enrolled him in various AAU swim clubs and bought him a guitar. She drove him to Hollywood and enrolled him in acting classes. Moses attended boarding school at the Chadwick School in Palos Verdes, California where he was an all C.I.F. swimmer. In high school, Moses joined with friends to form several bands. They played parties and weddings with some success. Moses had been studying martial arts since age thirteen, becoming a student of notable instructors including Bruce Lee, Ed Parker and Bob Ozman. He continued the training throughout his life, earning a black-belt in Isshin-Ryu Karate. He worked as an instructor for Bob Ozman at his Van Nuys studio. At Andover in Andover, Massachusetts, he was named to the N.I.S.C.A. Prep School All-America Swimming Team for three years in a row from 1969 to 1971 in events including Butterfly, Freestyle, 200-yard medley relay and 400-yard freestyle relay. Career Moses began his acting career in 1967, at age fifteen, in an Equity production of \\"The Fifth Season\\" at the Santa Monica Playhouse. In 1970, he appeared in an episode of Room 222, followed in 1971 with roles on Mission: Impossible and The F.B.I. He appeared in a production of Jean-Paul Sartre's \\"Dirty Hands (Les Mains Sales)\\" at the Gallery Theatre in Hollywood. He headlined at Ye Little Club, a popular venue in Beverly Hills. Roger Ailes spotted him on an episode of Owen Marshall. Ailes invited Moses to become a client. Moses moved to New York City. Ailes arranged an audition for Moses to perform for Budd Friedman, the owner of the well known New York night club The Improv. Moses‚Äô style clicked with Friedman and New York audiences. Moses became the only male singer to work the club regularly during that period along with the then unknown comedians Jay Leno, Richard Lewis, and Andy Kaufman. Moses worked a number of east coast night clubs, including Host's Farm in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and Michael's Pub in Manhattan, for several years, returning weekly to the Improv. He was hired to do a backer's audition for a prospective New York show that was mounted in Los Angeles. Budd Friedman had just opened his L.A. Improv. Moses was rehearsing the play by day and performing at the Improv at night. Moses was a veteran night club performer at this point. Standing ovations were not unusual for his twenty-minute sets. (Westways magazine did an article on this phenomenon.) A talent coordinator for the nationally syndicated Merv Griffin Show (Don Kane) was present one night. Two weeks later, Moses appeared on Merv's show. Merv, a successful singer himself for several decades, had Moses back 18 times in a nine-month period. In 1977, Moses played the title role in the prime-time action adventure drama Young Dan'l Boone on CBS. In 1978, Moses played the role of Bruce Scott in the feature film \\"Avalanche\\" which starred Rock Hudson and Mia Farrow. Also in 1978, 20th Century Fox record division released his LP album Face the Music. Moses is probably best known for playing Jefferson Smith Hutchins \\"(Hitman) Hutch\\" in the day-time soap opera General Hospital, from 1979 to 1980 on ABC. The story-line, carried by \\"Luke, Laura, and Hutch\\" made General Hospital one of the most popular shows on television. Time Magazine did an article on the subject. Moses had a hit in Germany in 1985 with the song \\"If I Could Just Fall in Love\\" released by Teldec Records of Hamburg, Germany as a 12\\" vinyl record. It was also made into a music video directed by the German filmmaker Utz Weber. In 1986, Moses played Niles Perry, the rock star love interest of Eve Harper, played by Linda Purl in the TV movie \\"Pleasures\\". His CD \\"Evil and Dangerous Men\\" was released in 2005 and received favorable reviews. The title song of the album was derived from the short film \\"Jack Takes a Vacation\\" that was co-produced, co-written and directed by Moses. He also played the title role. Scenes from the film were intercut and used in the music video for \\"Evil and Dangerous Men\\". Personal life Moses married Joni Morris in 1974. They had two sons, Richard, III and Tarrant, before they separated in 1982. In 1988, Moses married Colette Benhaim; they have four children together, all sons, Ronson, Adam, Dan and Naftali. Moses was raised an Episcopalian but in his forties he converted to Orthodox Judaism. In an interview with Internet journalist Luke Ford, Moses related that, after his sons, \\"Judaism became the singular most important thing to me.\\" He also stated: \\"I put my energies into (the study of Judaism) the same way a young man who wished to become a doctor would apply himself to his studies in medical school.\\" References External links * RickMoses.com *Rick Moses on Facebook Male actors from Los Angeles American male film actors American Orthodox Jews American music video directors American people of Welsh descent American people of Scottish descent Male actors from Pasadena, California American singer-songwriters 1952 births Living people Film directors from California Musicians from Pasadena, California Singers from Los Angeles Male actors from Washington, D.C.

Plot The story is told by a 1st-person narrator, a fifty-nine-year-old ex-naval lieutenant whose name is Edward, though other characters usually call him Skipper or Papa Cue Ball (due to his baldness). Though the tone of the novel strives to be comic and optimistic, the narrator's life is beset by a series of tragic events: his father (a mortician), his wife, and his daughter Cassandra commit suicide; his son-in-law Fernandez is killed after he has left Cassandra to live with his gay lover; Skipper is beaten up and perhaps raped during a mutiny on board of U.S.S. Starfish, the ship he commands in W.W.II; he is harassed by a small clan of shady fishermen on the \\"black island\\" in north-Atlantic where he settles after leaving the US Navy. The narrator eventually finds shelter in a tropical island with his black mess boy, Sonny, and his lover Catalina Kate, though it is not clear if the scenes on the island, where Skipper works as an artificial inseminator, are real or simply imagined. The novel is told in a non-linear fashion through a series of flashbacks. It is then at first difficult for the reader to understand the reasons of some weird episodes, such as the one which takes place in the second chapter, when Skipper, goaded by Cassandra, has the name of his son-in-law Fernandez tattooed on his chest in green ink. We subsequently discover that Fernandez has left Cassandra because their marriage was no more than a masquerade, devised to hide Skipper's incestuous relation to his daughter (which may also explain his wife Gertrude's suicide). Structure The chapters of the novel alternate moments in the present of the tropical island with flashbacks that show readers moments of the past in a jumbled fashion. * Naming Names is an introduction of the main characters of the novel. * Agony of the Sailor: thinking he will have \\"Cassandra\\" tattooed across his chest, Skipper agrees to undergo the painful procedure, only to discover Cassandra has instructed the tattooist to inscribe \\"Fernandez\\" instead. Sonny greets them when they leave for the East Coast. * Soldiers in the Dark: Skipper, Cassandra and Pixie (Fernandez and Cassandra's daughter) travel on a Greyhound coach from the West to the East Coast. The coach is hijacked in the desert by three soldiers gone AWOL. * The Artificial Inseminator: Skipper is on the tropical island with Sonny and Catalina Kate. * The Gentle Island: after having discovered that Fernandez has been killed, Skipper settles on the \\"black island\\" off the northeast coast of North America and meets Miranda, a widow whose purpose is unclear. * Cleopatra's Car: one cold night Skipper goes with Cassandra and a group of locals, Red and his sons Jomo and Bub, who have lecherous designs on Cassandra, to a dance in the high school gym. Skipper leaves the dance and is pelted by snowballs; then he finds out that Red, Jomo, Bub and Cassandra have left the party, so that he has to walk back home. On the way, Miranda tempts or teases him, and he flees. * Vile, in The Sunshine Crawling: Catalina Kate lies in the sand on her pregnant belly with an iguana clamped on her back; Skipper tries to chase the reptilian away but fails, and contents himself with waiting for the iguana to go away. * Wax in the Lilies: the marriage of Fernandez and Cassandra; Gertrude's funeral. * The Brutal Act: Tremlow's mutiny on the U.S.S. Starfish; Skipper, while on patrol duty, finds Fernandez dead (with his lover Harry, a sailor) in a seedy hotel in an East Coast city; Skipper's father commits suicide. * Land of Spices: Skipper, on the tropical island, inseminates a cow called Phyllis. * Drag Race on the Beach: a trip on Red's fishing boat on rough sea; Jomo takes Cassandra to the lighthouse; Bub distracts Skipper; Cassandra commits suicide; Skipper leaves the \\"black island\\". * The Golden Fleas: Kate gives birth to her and Skipper's child; there is a wake in the island's cemetery on All Saints' night.

As such, Kelly is historically a male-only name but has predominantly been used as a feminine given name since the 1960s, though with a significant minority usage as a masculine name, especially within Celtic families.http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=kelly+male+given+name+v+kelly+female+given+name During the peak of the name's popularity in the United States during the 1960s to 1970s, feminine usage was about four to five times as frequent as masculine usage. Etymology The surname Kelly has multiple origins. There is a Clan Kelly in Scotland, possibly derived from a toponym Kelloe. The Irish surname may be from either √ì Ceallaigh or √ì Cadhla, or yet again from a toponym. The surname was established in the United States by the early 19th century, and it began to be used as a masculine name in the later 19th century. Feminine usage first appeared in the 1940s and surpassed masculine usage around 1957 due to the popularity of the American actress Grace Kelly.http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=kelly+male+given+name+v+kelly+female+given+name Popularity According to the U.S. Social Security Administration, Kelly, as a name for a girl, was ranked #900 in 1950, then steadily gained popularity until 1977 (peaking at rank #10); Kelly, as a name for a boy, was consistently in the top 800 (but never the top 300) from 1881 to 1939, then steadily gained popularity until 1968 (peaking at rank #97). The feminine name reached two significant peaks, rank #12 in 1968, then declining to rank #23 in 1972, and again rising to rank #10 in 1977; both the feminine and the masculine name have been in steady decline since reaching their respective popularity peaks; the masculine name fell below rank #1000 in 2003; the feminine name lingers at rank #367 as of 2013. . In the United Kingdom, it made its way into the top 50 during the 1970s and by 1984 was the 15th most popular feminine first name. However, 10 years later it had declined to 53rd place and by 1999 had fallen out of the top 100.http://www.babynames.co.uk People with the name Feminine name *Kelly Ayotte (born 1968), American politician *Kelly J.

In the same season he played Appius Claudius in Virginius, Polixenes in the Winter's Tale, Gloucester in Jane Shore, Bassanio in the Merchant of Venice, and Claudio in Measure for Measure, in addition to other characters. He also took part in the melodramas of the Cataract of the Ganges and Kenilworth. He was the original representative of Opimius and Gesler in Sheridan Knowles' plays of Caius Gracchus (1823) and Willam Tell (1825). Archer visited the United States and was engaged in the management of several theatres there. Later in his life he became a member of the English company of actors performing in Paris with Harriet Smithson. At a still later period he led a company to Belgium and Germany, and presented certain of Shakespeare's plays at Brussels, Antwerp, Colog, Aix-la-Chapelle, Frankfort, and Hamburg. He was again a member of the Drury Lane company, under the management of Mr. Hammond, in 1839, and in 1845, appearing at Covent Garden Theatre, then under the management of M. Laurent, as the blind seer in the tragedy of Antigone. Writing Archer was also a playwright. He wrote several successful dramas and adaptations from the French, including the Black Doctor and the Little Devil. He also wrote one original play of historical interest, entitled Blood Royal, or the Crown Jewels. During the production of this play he commonly portrayed the hero, Colonel Blood.

(1636‚Äì1691), was the dean of Chester from 1682 until his death in 1691. Life Arderne belonged to the family of Arderne, which is one of great antiquity in Cheshire, and whose forty-five quarterings are sufficiently indicative of estate and consideration. The seat of the family was at Harden Hall, near Stockport, and at that mansion, now a ruin, James, son of Ralph Arderne of Harden, was baptised 12 October 1636. He entered Christ's College, Cambridge, 9 July 1636, but afterwards removed to St. John's, and took his B.A. in 1656, and afterwards his M.A. Two years later he went to Oxford University, and became M.A. in 1658. He was apparently afterwards resident in London; for he is stated to have been a member, in 1659, of a coterie that met nightly at the Turk's Head, New Palace Yard, Westminster, under the chairmanship of James Harrington, the author of 'Oceana'. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1668. The Restoration brought him within sight of preferment. In April 1666 he was curate of St. Botolph, Aldersgate, and held that post until 1682. Another of his preferments was Thornton-le-Moors. From the double inducement, we are told, of the public library and the society, he became a fellow-commoner of Brasenose College, Oxford, and in 1673 was admitted D.D. This degree he is also said to have had from Cambridge University. He was chaplain to Charles II, and his ministrations to that monarch procured him the rectory of Davenham in 1681 and the deanery of Chester In 1682. He is said to have had the promise of succession to the bishopric of Chester, but the events of the revolution prevented James II from giving him any further promotion. Arderne's devotion to the Stuarts is said to have brought him affronts in his own district so vexatious as to have shortened his life. He died in 1691, but the date of his death is variously given, as 18 August, 16 September, and 18 September. He was buried in the choir of his cathedral, with a monument on which, in accordance with his will, was inscribed: \\"Here lies the body of Dr. James Arderne, brother of Sir John Arderne, awhile dean of this church; who, though he bore a more than common affection to his private relations, yet gave the substance of his bequeathable estate to this cathedral, which gift, his will was, should be mentioned, that clergymen may consider whether it be not a sort of sacrilege to sweep away all from the church and charity into the possession of their lay kindred who are not needy\\". The particular intention of Arderne in this bequest was the foundation of a public library. The property was not then large, but was increased by the reversion to the younger branch of the Ardernes of the property of Mrs. Jane Done. George Ormerod, in printing the dean's will, observes that it is one \\"which the dean would certainly never have executed if he could have imagined that, from subsequent contingencies, it would have been the means of wresting from his family a very large share of one of the most ancient estates in the county, and have involved the representatives of two of his brothers in a series of law expenses, which compelled them to alienate a considerable portion of Mrs. Jane Done's bequest, the successive turns of presentation to the rectory of Tarporley\\". In the will he desires that the maps of Ortelius should be returned to Sir John Arderne, who had only lent the book for his lifetime. He mentions his collection of the fathers of the first three hundred years, and the common-place book which he had made from them of controversies. This he desired to be placed in the chapter-house for the use of the dean and prebendaries. A portrait of him is preserved in the deanery.

Baker), accessed 9 September 2013 They were hereditary wardens of Windsor Castle, from which they derived their name, and their close association with the monarchy temporarily lost them their lands on the defeat of Richard III in 1485. His grandfather, the first Lord Windsor was born Andrew Windsor and made Keeper of the wardrobe in 1506 - a position in the king's secret financial machinery which gave him control of a budget of thousands of pounds and great opportunities for profit.Penn, Thomas (2011): Winter King: the Dawn of Tudor England, Penguin Books, p. 169, He was an important part of the network of his cousin, the notorious Edmund Dudley, but early knowledge of the king's death allowed him to side-step Dudley's fall and he kept his position until his death in 1543. On his accession in 1509, the new King Henry VIII signalled his acceptance of Sir Andrew into the inner circles of government by making him Knight of the Bath and he was ennobled 20 years later. In his grandfather's dotage in 1542, during a visit by King Henry VIII, Lord Windsor was obliged to surrender one of the family manors, Stanwell between Hampton Court and Windsor to the crown, in return given a more modest historic farm of Hewell Grange, a manor of Tardebigge in north Worcestershire. The following year his grandfather died aged approximately 74. By contrast his father, the next Lord Windsor, could only survive 13 more years which enabled Edward to gain a peerage at age 26, in 1558. Adult life Monument to Lady Katherine de Vere, Tardebigge Church, Worcestershire Edward Windsor married Lady Katherine de Vere (1538‚Äì1600), the daughter of John de Vere, 16th Earl of Oxford and his first wife, Dorothy Neville. Katherine had a prominent younger half-brother and sister by her father's second marriage to Marjory Golding, Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, and Mary de Vere. On 2 October 1553, the day after the coronation of Queen Mary, he was appointed a Knight of the Carpet. He fought at the Battle of St Quentin (1557), an engagement of the Italian War of 1551‚Äì1559, as part of an English force commanded by Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford. In 1558, he succeeded to his father's title of Baron Windsor, which brought him a seat in the House of Lords during sessions of parliament. In 1563 he sold the remaining Middlesex family manor of Littleton (bought in 1528) to Francis Vaughan. In 1566, Queen Elizabeth visited Windsor at his seat of Bradenham, Buckinghamshire. A firm Roman Catholic, he lived many years on the continent of Europe.Notes and Queries (Oxford University Press, 1857), p. 270 Windsor was admitted to the bar as a member of the Middle Temple, the bench book of which records: Tomb in Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice He died in Venice, where he is buried in the Basilica of San Giovanni & San Paolo.

This is achieved through both continuous distance learning and residential events, which take place three times a year and include both subject-specific lectures and cross-disciplinary personal development sessions. There are nine subject sections: biochemistry, chemistry, computer science, economics, history, Lithuanian philology, mathematics, music, and physics and astronomy. Around 250 students are currently members of the Academy.  People   Administration  The Academy is run by a group of dedicated volunteers who take care of matters such as finance, organisation of the educational and personal development programme, information technology, international collaboration and sponsorship. The head of the Academy is the director, currently Leonas Narkeviƒçius.  Subject leaders, curators and teachers  NMA comprises nine subject divisions: biochemistry, chemistry, economics, physics and astronomy, Lithuanian philology, computer science, history, mathematics and music. Each is overseen by a subject leader who, together with curators, is responsible for provision of the distance-learning material and the selection of lecturers for the residential events.  Students  The Academy accepts students from grades 9-10, but particular subjects (maths, Lithuanian) may accept younger students (grades 7-8). They will stay with the Academy until the end of grade 12 as long as their marks are satisfactory.  Study programme   Distance learning  The students take part in a web-based continuous study programme where they regularly receive tasks graded by levels of difficulty. On average, a student receives a new assessment throughout the academic year. The results of the distance-learning programme are one of the criteria for selection to attend the residential events.  Residential sessions  The most diligent students are invited to participate in the residential sessions, of which there are three per year: in spring (in Vilnius or Kaunas), summer (in Nida) and winter (in Palanga). They consist of a range of events: subject lectures by invited specialists, personal development sessions involving art, dance, singing and sports, meetings with prominent academics, artists and public figures, intellectual games, film nights and so on. The aim is not only to provide extra academic tuition, but to promote self-expression and interpersonal communication. At least twice a year the NMA students and teachers arrange cultural events that are open to the public. In the summer, the philology students organise literary reading sessions. The closing evening of both winter and summer sessions usually features a concert by the music students for other participants, guests of the Academy and the local public.

Marginalized, at-risk groups such as members of the LGBTQ+ community, intravenous drug users, and sex workers are most vulnerable to facing HIV/AIDS discrimination. The consequences of societal stigma against PLHIV are quite severe, as HIV/AIDS discrimination actively hinders access to HIV/AIDS screening and care around the world. Moreover, these negative stigmas become used against members of the LGBTQ+ community in the form of stereotypes held by physicians. __HIV/AIDS discrimination takes many forms such as blood donation restrictions on at-risk populations, compulsory HIV testing without prior consent, violations of confidentiality within healthcare settings, and targeted violence against persons living with HIV. Although disability laws within many countries prohibit HIV/AIDS discrimination in housing, employment, and access to health/social services, HIV-positive individuals around the world still experience instances of stigma and abuse. Overall, pervasive HIV/AIDS discrimination leads to low turn-out for HIV counseling and testing, identity crises, isolation, loneliness, low self-esteem, and a lack of interest in containing the disease. Additionally, violent acts against HIV infected individuals or people who are perceived to be infected with HIV can severely shut down the advancement of treatment in response to the progression of the disease.  HIV-related stigma  Stigma is often enforced by discrimination, callous actions, and bigotry. HIV/AIDS stigma is divided into the following three categories: * Instrumental AIDS stigma‚Äîa reflection of the fear and apprehension that are likely to be associated with any deadly and transmissible illness. * Symbolic AIDS stigma‚Äîthe use of HIV/AIDS to express attitudes toward the social groups or lifestyles perceived to be associated with the disease. * Courtesy AIDS stigma‚Äîstigmatization of people connected to the issue of HIV/AIDS or HIV- positive people.[4] HIV-related stigma is very common worldwide. People who are infected with HIV often experience systemic discrimination and ostracism within their communities. In both high-income and low-income nations, persons living with HIV are routinely discriminated against at work, school, and healthcare facilities.Cameron, Sally; Jane Wilson, Julian Hows, Rodrigo Pascal, Jaime Todd-Gher, Liz Tremlett, Ann Stevens, and John Godwin. \\"People Living with HIV Stigma Index; Asia Pacific Regional Analysis 2011.\\"(1‚Äì99). Joint United Nations Program, 2011. In conjunction with internal distress, these construed beliefs make it more difficult for PLHIV to feel comfortable in obtaining the medical services they need. __ Misconceptions about HIV in the United States  Today, there continues to be significant misconceptions about HIV within the United States. Furthermore, misconceptions about the transmission of HIV promotes fear amongst many members of society, and this often translates into biased and discriminatory actions against PLHIV. A 2009 study conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that many Americans still lack basic knowledge about HIV. According to the survey, a third of Americans erroneously believe that HIV could be transmitted through sharing a drink or touching a toilet used by an HIV-positive individual. Furthermore, the study reported that 42 percent of Americans would be uncomfortable with having an HIV-positive roommate, 23 percent would be uncomfortable with an HIV-positive coworker, 50 percent would be uncomfortable with an HIV-positive person preparing their food, and 35 percent would be uncomfortable with their child having an HIV-positive teacher. Many of the respondents who were able to correctly answer questions about HIV transmission still reported similar biased views against HIV-positive individuals; in fact, 85 percent of these respondents reported that they would feel uncomfortable working with an HIV- positive coworker.  Misconceptions about transmission of HIV  The only way that HIV can be transmitted from one individual to the next is by sharing of certain bodily fluids such as semen, blood, and vaginal discharge which the virus uses as a medium to enter the bloodstream of the recipient; HIV is not transmissible via fluids such as saliva, sweat, tears, or urine as it is not in high enough concentrations to spread in these matters. In order for HIV to enter another person, either the semen, blood, or vaginal discharge must find an entry point by way of injection, unprotected sex, or during pregnancy as the mother can pass it along; one would only contract the virus when coming in direct contact with these fluids, for example, with an open cut on the skin that exposes blood. PLHIV do not always pass on the virus to someone else when engaging in sexual activities or sharing bodily fluids; PLHIV can have no transmission risk by taking medication which lowers the amount of HIV present in the bloodstream, rendering the individual as having an undetectable viral load. PrEP (Pre-exposure prophylaxis), on the other hand, is a drug that is used as a preventative measure against HIV for those who are at a higher risk of contracting the virus but does not cure someone who has HIV; furthermore, the medication should be taken regularly in order to have a higher protective chance against HIV and is not a one-time medication nor does it treat PLHIV. People cannot contract AIDS, rather they are infected with HIV which progresses into AIDS over time when left unchecked; if someone has HIV, it does not guarantee that they will develop AIDS. By frequently taking medication such as antiretroviral therapy (ART), the abundance of HIV in the bloodstream is reduced and prevents it from developing into AIDS. __ Misconceptions about at-risk populations  Many people incorrectly believe that HIV is exclusive to gay men who have sex, but, although the risks are higher for gay and bisexual males, anyone is susceptible to contracting the virus regardless of their sexual orientation, race, age, and so forth. Some forms of violence such as childhood trauma, rape, and sexual assault can lead people to engage in unsafe sexual practices which would increase their chances of contracting HIV. In some cases, young girls and women who experience these traumatic events become sex workers or engage in prostitution which further increases these risks as well as contributes to the development of AIDS with lack of treatment. These discriminatory views of HIV-positive patients also persist within the medical field. A 2006 study of health professionals in Los Angeles County found that 56 percent of nursing facilities, 47 percent of obstetricians, and 26 percent of plastic surgeons had unlawfully refused to treat an HIV-positive patient, citing concerns of HIV transmission. Overall, this societal stigma and discrimination has exacerbated distrust towards healthcare workers within the HIV-positive population. The health care community therefore has an ethical duty to dispel stereotypes and misconceptions about HIV.  Blood donation restrictions on at-risk populations  Between 1970 and 1980, more than 20,000 HIV infections were attributed to contaminated blood transfusions. The lack of sensitive blood screening methods for HIV detection prompted the enactment of lifetime bans on blood donations from men who have sex with men (MSM), sex workers, and intravenous drug users, as these population groups were viewed to be at high risk of contracting HIV. At the time, this policy was viewed by health professionals as an emergency measure to prevent the contamination of the general blood supply. Multilateral institutions such as the World Health Organization actively promoted the enactment of lifetime bans in efforts to mitigate transfusion-related HIV infections. This ban was adopted by the United States, as well as several European countries in the 1980s. The blood donation ban on MSM and transgender women, in particular, has provoked substantial criticism. Members of the LGBTQ+ community view these laws as discriminatory and homophobic. A significant criticism of the blood donation restrictions is that healthcare workers treat the LGBTQ+ community as a homogenous population that engages in similar sexual practices and behaviors. However, like any other population, MSM vary greatly in the number of sexual partners they have and in their engagement in high-risk sexual behaviors. Overall, the donation ban on MSM and transgender women has further exacerbated growing distrust of the medical system within the LGBTQ+ community, especially given the history of homophobia within the medical profession. As a result of these policies, LGBTQ+ individuals have felt substantial pressure to conceal their sexual orientation from medical providers and healthcare personnel. Blood banks today utilize advanced serological testing technologies with close to 100% sensitivity and specificity. Currently, the risk of HIV-contaminated blood infection is 1 per 8-to-12 million donations, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of modern HIV screening technologies. Despite these significant laboratory advances, the lifetime blood donation ban on MSM remains in several Western countries. Today, medical organizations such as the American Red Cross and World Health Organization are highly critical of these lifetime bans on men who have sex with men, as the epidemiology of HIV has changed drastically in the last 40 years. In 2015, a mere 27% of novel HIV infections originated from the MSM population. In response to this epidemiological data, public health experts, medical personnel, and blood-banking organizations have called upon country governments to reform these outdated MSM blood donation policies. Mounting public pressure has prompted countries such as the United States and United Kingdom to reform their MSM blood donation restrictions. In 2015, the United States substituted its lifetime ban for a 12-month deferral since last MSM sexual contact, although indefinite lifetime bans remain in place for sex workers and IV drug users. Despite these small steps in the right direction, the American Red Cross has recommended that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) further revise its policy by adopting a 3-month deferral period for MSM, as this is the current standard in countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom. Overall, it is estimated that completely lifting the MSM blood donation ban could increase the total blood supply in the United States by 2-4%, which could help save millions of lives. Given the blood supply shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic, blood donation restrictions have recently become the subject of further criticism.  Discriminatory practices in health-care settings  Discriminatory practices within the medical field have greatly impacted the health outcomes of HIV-positive individuals. In both low-income and high-income nations, there have been several reported cases of medical providers administering low-quality care or denying care altogether to patients with HIV. In a 2013 study conducted in Thailand, 40.9 percent of health workers reported worrying about touching the clothing and personal belongings of patients with HIV, despite possessing the knowledge that HIV does not spread through such items. In a 2008 study of 90 countries, one in four persons living with HIV reported experiencing some form of discrimination in health-care settings. Furthermore, one in five individuals with HIV reported having been denied medical care. Even more concerning is the impact HIV-related discrimination has had on HIV-positive women. According to the 2008 study, one in three women living with HIV have reported instances of discrimination related to their sexual and reproductive health within a health-care setting. Another common form of discrimination within healthcare settings is the disclosure of a patient's HIV status without the patient's explicit permission. Within many countries, an HIV-positive status can result in social exclusion, loss of social support, and decreased chances of getting married. Therefore, concerns about potential breaches of confidentiality by health workers pose significant barriers to care for HIV-positive individuals. In a comprehensive study of 31 countries, one in five persons living with HIV reported instances of a health provider disclosing their HIV-positive status without consent. These discriminatory practices within the medical field have resulted in the delayed initiation of HIV treatment among HIV-positive individuals. In New York City, men who have sex with men, transgender women, and persons of color living with HIV have all reported that stigma among medical providers was a major deterrent from entering or staying in HIV care. A 2011 community-based study found that the most widely reported barrier to care amongst HIV-positive individuals is fear of stigma within healthcare settings. HIV-positive individuals who have experienced significant HIV- related stigma are 2.4 times less likely to present for HIV care. Currently, as many as 20‚Äì40 percent of Americans who are HIV-positive do not begin a care regimen within the first six months of diagnosis. Overall, this perpetuation of HIV stigma has been detrimental to the health outcomes of HIV-positive individuals, as patients who begin treatment late in the progression of HIV have a 1.94 times greater risk of mortality in comparison to those who start treatment at the onset of diagnosis. Therefore, delayed HIV treatment due to fears of discrimination can have fatal consequences.  Violence against persons living with HIV  Discrimination that is violent or threatening violence stops a lot of individuals from getting tested for HIV, which does not aid in curing the virus. Violence is an important factor against the treatment of people afflicted with AIDS. When PLHIV, particularly women, develop an intimate relationship, they tend not to be able to disclose to their partners of the presence of HIV in their system for fear of violence against them; this fear prevents them from receiving financial support to seek out testing, treatment, and general support from medical professionals & family members. A study done on PLHIV in South Africa shows that out of a study population of 500, 16.1% of participants reported being physically assaulted, with 57.7% of those resulting from one's intimate partners such as husbands and wives. The available data show high rates of participants socially isolating themselves from both friends and family, in addition to avoiding the seeking of treatment at hospitals or clinics due to increasing internalized fears.  Psychological impact of HIV discrimination  Persons living with HIV have developed self-depreciating mindsets and coping skills to deal with the social repercussions of an HIV-positive diagnosis. A common concern of PLHIV is the belief that they will automatically develop AIDS and not be able to live a long, productive life as others around them. While there is no cure for HIV/AIDS, ART and other medication prevent the virus from worsening and spreading which allows for PLHIV to live longer and still establish a life or family with people. Albeit, not every PLHIV is knowledgeable about these resources which can lead them to adopt a depressive state of mind by associating their condition with early death. In some cases, ART can reduce feelings of anxiety in individuals while induce other symptoms that worsen the mental health of some PLHIV and should be taken as directed by a physician; likewise, taking ART with other prescriptions might exacerbate these mental health conditions. Negative social consequences such as stigmatization and discrimination have severe psychological implications on PLHIV: when a person chooses to disclose their status, it can lead to restricted options for marriage and even employment. This tends to worsen the mental health of these individuals and often results in a fear of disclosure. Research done in South Africa has found that the high levels of stigma experienced by HIV-positive individuals has a severe psychological impact. Internalized stigma and discrimination run rampant throughout the PLHIV community, as many PLHIV in South Africa blamed themselves for their current situation. The psychological support for PLHIV in certain countries around the world is quite scarce. A study examining the impact of stigma on PLHIV concluded that experiencing higher levels of HIV discrimination is correlated with a depressive state and even receiving psychiatric care the previous year. Depressive symptoms have also been correlated with elevated rates of suicidal ideation, anxiety and disease progression. Another recent study that predominantly focused on HIV-positive African American men concluded that stigma has a profound impact on reducing the quality of life of these individuals. Studies have also shown that individuals living in non- metropolitan areas of the United States also experience large amounts of emotional distress. 60% of participants enrolled in a randomized clinical trial reported moderate or severe levels of depressive symptomatology on the Beck Depression Inventory. This is due to these participants receiving much less social support, and also due to great levels of HIV-related stigma and rejection within families. Furthermore, relative to their urban counterparts, PLHIV in non-metropolitan areas experience more loneliness, a lack of sufficient healthcare and social services, and higher levels of discrimination which contribute to much greater levels of emotional distress.  HIV/AIDS health disparities in marginalized groups  The U.S. HIV epidemic has drastically evolved over the course of the last 30 years and has been rampantly widespread in socially marginalized and underrepresented communities. Statistics show that most HIV infections afflict sexual minorities and communities of color. For example, in 2009, African Americans accounted for 44% of all new HIV infections while making up only 14% of the U.S. population. Similarly, 78% of HIV infections in Georgia occur among African Americans, while African Americans comprise only 30% of the overall population. Hall et al. (2008) found distinct incidence rates of HIV infection among African Americans (83/100,000 population) and Latinos (29/100,000), specifically when compared to whites (11/100,000). The single group that is consistently at the greatest risk for HIV infection happens to form the intersection of sexual orientation and racial background; MSM (men who have sex with men) are the most HIV affected Americans, and African American MSM are at an HIV risk that is six times greater than that of white MSM. Aside from race and sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, education and employment are all equally important factors that studies link to HIV infection. The CDC reports that HIV rates are highest among groups who are at or below the poverty level; they also found that individuals who are unemployed and/or have less than a high school education are more prone to HIV infection. In order to help HIV infected persons receive care, the first vital step revolves around HIV testing and early diagnosis. Delayed testing is highly detrimental and leads to an increased risk of HIV transmission. Currently, there are many issues associated with HIV diagnosis and lack of available testing for minorities. A study of 16 US cities found that African Americans are more likely to be tested much later for HIV infection, which places this group at a stark disadvantage for gaining access to proper treatment. This is problematic because HIV is only half of the story: a prolonged HIV infection can quickly become an AIDS diagnosis, and this can be prevented with early and frequent testing. Approximately 35%-45% of those diagnosed with HIV are believed to also have AIDS at the time of testing. About half of the people diagnosed with HIV do not receive care in any given year, which poses a risk that they are endangering others while they are not given treatment. Various studies suggest that groups with lower socioeconomic status and lower education level are associated with poorer medication adherence. However, those with HIV who are more privileged and more educated have easy access to quality health insurance and the best medical care.

Because the highest peaks in Europe fall into this category, the summits of four- thousanders are popular in Europe with climbers and mountaineers as climbing goals. Although climbing these peaks does not require an expedition to be mounted (unlike the highest peaks in other continents), knowledge and experience of high altitude climbing is a pre-requisite for attempting these peaks.  Europe  ‚Üí See: List of Alpine four-thousanders Four-thousanders are the highest mountains and summits in Europe and are all found in the Alps. There is no agreement over where the boundary is between Europe and Asia which is why there is a dispute over which continent the over 5,000 metres high Caucasus range is in. In the Alps the highest four-thousander is Mont Blanc at 4,810 metres, the lowest, at exactly 4,000 metres is the eastern summit of Les Droites. The exact number of Alpine four-thousanders is unclear, because there are no commonly agreed criteria for mountains, summits and subpeaks. Officially, the International Mountaineering and Climbing Federation, UIAA, has declared 82 peaks as four-thousanders and 46 as four-thousander subpeaks, which are spread across three countries. In all 55 peaks lie entirely within one country, over 27 straddle a border but none is located at a tripoint. By the UIAA's definition, Switzerland has 48 four-thousanders, Italy has 35 and France 26.Die Viertausender der Alpen ‚Äì Offizielles UIAA-Verzeichnis. In: UIAA-Bulletin. UIAA, Nr. 145, March 1994. (pdf; 633 kB). The four-thousanders are found mainly in the Western Alps, in the ranges of the Bernese Alps (9), Dauphin√© Alps (2) Graian Alps (29) and Pennine Alps (41). The only four- thousander in the Eastern Alps is Piz Bernina (4,049 m) in the Bernina Group.  Asia  In Asia mountain ranges there are four-thousanders in various countries, like in Pakistan, Afghanistan, China, India, Nepal, Iran, etc.  Africa  In Africa mountain ranges there are four-thousanders in the High Atlas (Toubkal: 4,167 m), in the Ethiopian Highlands (Ras Daschan: 4,620 m), in the foothills of the Adamaoua Mountains (Mount Cameroon: 4,070 m), in the Virunga Volcanoes (Karisimbi: 4,507m) and in the shape of the 4,565 m high Mount Meru in Tanzania. In Africa there is a total of 38 four-thousanders.  North America  In the Rocky Mountains there is a large number of four- thousanders, especially in the state of Colorado (Mount Elbert: 4,402 m) and Wyoming (Gannett Peak: 4,210 m). In addition the Sierra Nevada rises well above 4,000 m; its highest peak is Mount Whitney at 4,420 m. On Hawaii the volcano of Mauna Kea lies 4,214 m above sea level and has an overall height of 9,705 m above the seabed. The US-American equivalent of the four-thousanders are the fourteeners, which include all mountains that are higher than 14,000 feet (4,267.2 m).  Antarctica  The highest mountain in Antarctica is Mount Vinson (4,892 m), which was thought to be a five thousander for a long time. In addition there are other peaks over 4,000 metres high, such as Mount Kirkpatrick (4,528 m) in the Trans-Antarctic Mountains.  Special four- thousanders  In Asia and South America four-thousanders play a secondary role because there the highest mountains average between seven and eight thousand metres high or around 6,500 metres high respectively.

T'nalak cloth are woven from abac√° fibers. The traditional female weavers are known as dream weavers, because the pattern of the t'nalak cloth are inspired by their dreams. Introduction T'nalak is a traditional cloth found in Mindanao island made by a group of people in Lake Sebu, South Cotabato called T'bolis, Tboli people. This traditional cloth is hand-woven made of Abaca fibers which traditionally has three primary colors, red, black and the original color of the Abaca leaves. The colorant of the materials are naturally dyed boiled in with bark, roots and leaves of plants. It is a heritage and believed that the intricate and creative patterns of the Tinalak was seen on their dreams and made it on to work. They can't create a design of the Tinalak if they haven't dreamed of it. They are sometimes called the \\"Dream Weavers\\". T'boli weavers in Lake Sebu, South Cotabato The T‚Äônalak fabric holds a special and prominent place in [T‚Äôboli] culture. It is ever present in significant turning points in a [Tboli] life, such as birth, marriage, and death. It is the medium which sanctifies these rites, enveloping them in the length of its fabric like a benediction. It has also often been referred to as ‚Äúwoven dreams‚Äù. It is exactly that, and more. In a culture which didn‚Äôt have a form of writing, the T‚Äônalak served as both Literature and Art. The [T‚Äôbolis] expressed everything they are in the T‚Äônalak: their dreams, beliefs, myths and even their religion. Making use of the various geometrical patterns and the trademark red, black and white colors, the [T‚Äôbolis] weave the natural and the supernatural in the abaca strands of the T‚Äônalak. Furthermore, the weaving process integrates the personal, the social and the cultural. After a weaver reaches a certain degree of expertise, she becomes a ‚Äúmaster weaver‚Äù ‚Äì someone who can interpret and take inspiration from dreams, hence the term ‚Äúdreamweavers‚Äù. By all accounts, this seems to be an intense personal experience for the weaver, and the moment she succeeds in doing this is the moment she becomes an artist. And then it is also social because the T‚Äônalak binds together all that the [T‚Äôboli]people believe in. The skill of the weaver gathers in the T‚Äônalak all the elements that make the [T‚Äôboli] social life. Finally, it is cultural in that it is the means through which other tribes identify the [T‚Äôbolis] since the T‚Äônalak is uniquely and distinctly [T‚Äôboli]. Tinalak are also their prized possession at marriage, even the covering for childbirth for ensuring safe delivery and for trading. Whenever they sell their work, they put a brass ring around it as for the spirits to allow them or to please. It is believed that cutting the cloth would deliver sickness.

Sterility has a wide range of causes. It may be an inherited trait, as in the mule; or it may be acquired from the environment, for example through physical injury or disease, or by exposure to radiation. Mechanisms of sterility Hybrid sterility can be caused by different closely related species breeding and producing offspring, these animals are usually sterile due to different numbers of chromosomes from the two parents, causing an imbalance in the resulting offspring making it viable but not fertile, this is the case with the mule. Sterility can also be caused by selective breeding, where a selected trait is closely linked to genes involved in sex determination or fertility, for example goats breed to be polled (hornless), this results in a high number of intersex individuals among the offspring, which are typically sterile. Sterility can also be caused by chromosomal differences within an individual, these individuals tend to be known as a genetic mosaics. Loss of part of a chromosome can also cause sterility due to nondisjunction. XX male syndrome is another cause of sterility, this is where the sexual determining factor on the Y chromosome (SRY) is transferred to the X chromosome due to an unequal crossing over, this gene indicated what gender the individual should be and causes the development of testes, causing the individual to be phenotypically male but genotypically female, the resulting individual is (information needed). Economic uses of sterility Economic uses of sterility include: * the production of certain kinds of seedless fruit, such as seedless tomato or watermelon (though sterility is not the only available route to fruit seedlessness); * terminator technology, methods for restricting the use of genetically modified plants by causing second generation seeds to be sterile; * biological control; for example, trap-neuter-return programs for cats; and the sterile insect technique, in which large numbers of sterile insects are released, which compete with fertile insects for food and mates, thus reducing the population size of subsequent generations, which can be used to fight diseases spread by insect vectors such as malaria in mosquitoes. *some animals which can produce sterile offspring because of mating with closely related species like mule, jenny, liger and tigon.

Plot Langurs in Jaipur Each episode starts with an introduction of the Galta Gang, led by alpha male Tarak and his friend Rani. The troop defend their temple home from neighboring langur monkeys and other troops of macaques. They subsist on food offered to them by worshippers who revere them as the personification of Hanuman, a central character of the Indian epic Ramayana, and a continuous supply of water in pools fed by underground springs. Zamir, the largest and most powerful male in the troop, is yet to be the leader and has ambitions to do so. In order to gain support from lower-ranking members, he needs to show he can feed his family, but his raids on kitchens, cars, and homes soon get him a reputation as the biggest monkey burglar in all of Jaipur. Zamir is eventually ousted from the troop, and spends months wandering the busy city streets on his own. Eventually, he joins another troop, but before he can put his plans in action, the alpha of his new gang is trapped by the city's monkey catcher along with many of his top lieutenants. Zamir suddenly finds himself in charge. When the annual monsoon rains fail to appear as scheduled, a drought threatens the desert city's food supply, and Jaipur's residents have no surplus resources for the Galta Gang. Tarak leaves their temple home unguarded as he leads his family into the city in search of feeding opportunities. The neighboring langur monkeys try to steal ownership of the ancient temple, but the Galta Gang returns and forces the langurs to flee. Zamir and his new troop launch a takeover bid for the temple but are defeated by the Galta Gang. He is eventually captured by the city's monkey catcher and relocated 70 miles away. Tarak dies from wounds he sustained during the battle with Zamir's troop. Rani, the queen of the troop, also disappears, turning up days later with her newest baby, Teejay. With their king gone and Zamir no longer a threat, Kamal, Tarak's second in command, assumes leadership of the Galta Gang. The second season begins several months after the death of Tarak. Kamal does not have the skills necessary to lead the troop, now with 80 members. Macaque troops usually undergo a process known as fission to reduce their numbers in which lower-class members break off to form their own group. Bipin, Yash and Tito, plus as many as 40 others, splinter away under the rule of a new leading pair, alpha male Devdin and queen Chaia. Zamir finds his way back to Jaipur searching for the Galta Gang and encounters the new splinter group. Meanwhile, the Galta Gang lose their temple to a troop of langur monkeys and are forced to find a new territory in the city. Kamal cannot live up to his role as leader and the troop becomes unstable. They encounter the monkey catcher, and Teejay goes missing. In search of his family, he returns to the Galta Temple to discover the langur monkeys have taken up residence. Hungry and alone, Teejay climbs a high tension power pylon and suffers an electric shock similar to the one Kavi experienced in the first season. He is taken to the same animal rescue charity hospital, Help in Suffering. Despite receiving emergency medical treatment, he dies. The rest of the Galta Gang continues to survive living in the streets of Jaipur but then encounter the splinter troop and flee in fear. Zamir eventually finds the Galta Gang, but instead of launching an attack, he leads the troop to find food. Eventually he even leads them back to the Galta Temple and regains their residence from the langur monkeys. Zamir assumes the role as alpha male of the Galta Gang. Galta Gang Tarak Tarak is the 10-year-old alpha male of the Galta Gang. With the support of his partner Rani, Tarak has led the troop for over three years. He has fathered the majority of the troop youngsters, including Esha. Rani Rani is the queen of the troop and mother to Esha and Teejay. She assumes leadership in the second season following Tarak's death and Kamal's ineffective leadership though later supports Zamir as the new alpha male. Zamir Zamir is a large 9-year-old male monkey who constantly challenges Tarak's leadership. He is ultimately exiled from the Galta Gang and wanders Jaipur until being accepted into Vasu's troop in which he ultimately assumes leadership and leads his troop in war with the Galta Gang. He seriously injures Tarak but is defeated and ultimately relocated by the monkey catcher to the forest. He returns to Jaipur and rejoins the Galt Gang to regain the Galta Temple from the langurs and become the new alpha male. Kamal Kamal is Tarak's second-in-command and assumes leadership of the Galta Gang after Tarak's disappearance following the skirmish with Zamir's troop. Under his leadership, the Galta Gang splits into two factions, and his faction flees the temple when challenged by the langur monkeys. He is ultimately relocated by the monkey catcher. Binita Binita is Rani's oldest daughter. She is referred to as 'Quirky Binita' and 'Eccentric Binita' because of her unusual preferences. Binita prefers odd activities like staring at her troop through a piece of plastic, gazing at her own image in a pool of water, or dressing up in fabrics, and doesn't seem to share her troop's drive for finding food. She's an overly enthusiastic babysitter. While female macaques frequently engage in \\"aunting,\\" Binita kidnaps her baby sister from her distracted mother. Rani reacts quickly, and Esha is returned unharmed. Esha Esha is Rani's second and youngest daughter. She is known for her inquisitiveness in the first season. Anoop Anoop is one of the young males and a friend of Bipin, Yash and Tito. He enjoys ice cream. Kavi Kavi is a friend of Bipin, Yash and Tito. He is electrocuted while fleeing and is nursed back to health by an animal charity organisation called \\"Help in Suffering.\\" When Kavi is released, he joins Zamir's troop but reunites with the Galta Gang during the battle at Galta Temple. Teejay Teejay is Tarak and Rani's youngest son. While escaping the langur monkeys, he is electrocuted and dies.  Splinter troop (season 2)  Bipin Bipin was one of the rowdy teenage males in the Galta Gang. He suffered from depression when his best pals, Yash and Tito, were captured along with several other Galta Gang troop members by the city's monkey catcher. Fortunately, they managed to make their way back to city and Bippin was relieved. In season two, Bipin and around forty other lower-ranking of the Galta Gang were ousted from Galta Temple by queen Rani and her upper-class members. The Splinter troop established a territory in the city, only to encounter the Galta Gang (ousted from the temple by the langurs) but saw them off. When Bipin, Yash and Tito reached sexual maturity, the splinter group exiled them. They became three bachelors roaming the city. They tried to join other gangs, but the alpha males of the groups did not want them. Eventually, Yash and Tito were each accepted into two separate groups; Bipin was left to wander alone. He met two rambunctious, trouble-making twin boys, Gangol and Ragin, who accepted Bipin; he hadn't been accepted by the group yet. Meanwhile, the monkey catcher thought he had plotted a great plan by tricking the group into entering an apartment by providing their favorite cookies and treats. His ultimate plan was to relocate the twins about 90 miles outside of the city, into a forest with other macaques. The monkey catcher's hope was to catch the thieving twins, but only one of them went in with several others in the group. The monkey catcher closed the door, thinking that catching one was better than none. Watching outside were Bipin and the other twin. They heard the screams and cries of the other monkeys and wanted to do something about it. After a quick look at the door, the twin unlocked it and Bipin pushed it open. Soon, all the monkeys in the group were free and the monkey catcher's plans were foiled. Bipin was then welcomed into the gang. But the monkey catcher wasn't done yet. He decided to stop trying to catch the twins and instead herd the gang up to the Galta Temple. The monkey catcher didn't take into account that Galta was already claimed by the original Galta Gang and for them to take the temple, they would have to fight. When the twins and their gang reached the temple, they were mesmerized by the paradise of pools and beautiful ground. But Bipin took one look at the Galta Temple and his former family and quickly changed sides. Unfortunately, the Galta Gang didn't have a king and queen at the time. So it looked as if the twins and their gang were going to win. Suddenly, Zamir reappeared. He had been exiled, but had returned to Galta and the twin's gang knew they didn't stand a chance. After the brawl, Zamir lay down in submission, leaving the king spot open for someone else for Elsa to choose, and she chose Gangol. Yash Yash was friends with Bipin and Tito. He was among those captured by the monkey catcher and relocated to the forest. He later reunited with the Galta Gang but was ousted by the upper class and joined the splinter group. Tito Tito was one of three rowdy teenage males and friends with Bipin and Yash. During a feeding foray, Yash, Tito and several other members of the Galta Gang were captured by the monkey catcher and relocated in the forest. The captured individuals eventually managed to find their way back to Jaipur and reunite with the Galta Gang. In season two, Tito and around forty other lower ranking Galta Gang members left the temple to form the splinter troop after being ousted by queen Rani and her upper- class family. Devdin After the lower ranking members of the Galta Gang were ousted from the temple by Rani, Devdin, a subordinate male, took leadership of his small splinter troop and became their new alpha male, with the support of his queen Chaia and their baby Dimple, and led his troop out of the temple and into the city searching for a new territory in take ownership of. During a run in with the bachelor males, Devdin led his troop out of the Pink City and into a desolate old castle building before deciding to lead his splinter troop back to the city and establishing a new territory, including fending off and the Galta Gang elite from their newfound patch of real-estate. Other featured macaques Fang Named after his scar at the left side of his mouth, Fang was the Galta Gang's most feared enemy. He defended his territory from other troops, including Zamir when he tried to mate with one of the females. Vasu Vasu was the original alpha male of the troop Zamir joined after he reappeared from exile. He was impressed by Zamir's food- finding skills and in doing so allowed him to join his troop. During a feeding foray at a grain market, Zamir set Vasu and a handful of his troop members up and got them caught by the city's monkey catcher and were relocated to a faraway forest outside the city of Jaipur. Vasu and his captured followers learn to adapt to their new environment after realising that they could never make it back to the city of Jaipur. Episodes Season 1 =Episode 1: Apartment Job= We are introduced to the Galta Gang, a 60-strong troop of wild but urbanised rhesus macaques who live in Galta Temple residing in the city of Jaipur, northwestern India. Tarak is the alpha male, at ten years old, and has been in charge of the troop for nearly three years. He and his troop live a life of luxury within the compound of the Galta Temple where they are fed a continuous variety of food by passing worshippers who pay their respects to lord Hanuman. the Hindu monkey God. With so much food and an abundance of water at the spring pool situated at the lower compound of the temple, the Galta Gang have little reason to leave home and go to the ever busy streets of Jaipur. However, the long-awaited monsoon rains are late this year and food is running out, which means that Tarak and his troop are being given less and less food as people have to save what they have for themselves. As the drought continues meaning less food for the troop, Tarak leads the gang out into the city streets in search of feeding opportunities. Rhesus macaques are highly adaptable and can thrive almost anywhere. For this reason, the Galta Gang have adapted to living in close proximity to humans and can navigate through the network of electrical wires around the city streets. The three most troublesome youngsters: Bipin, Yash and Tito, along with young Kavi, get up to their usual mischievous antics. Kavi tries to chew on an electrical cable and gets a small and brief electrical shock. After travelling the streets for a few hours, Rani, the Queen of the troop, decides to engage the troop in some grooming. Rani is the alpha female, at fifteen years old, and already has six offspring. Her youngest and latest baby, Esha, automatically inherits the throne and has the highest rank in comparison to not only her older sisters but also all the females in troop. While most of the troop members enjoying a grooming session, the troublesome teens Bipin, Yash, Tito and tag-a-long Kavi resort to a game of jumping into a water trough, despite the interruption of street dogs visiting for a drink. Eventually the troop come across a feeding opportunity; an open window of an apartment. The human owners were out of sight, giving the Galta Gang an opportunity to enter the house through the kitchen window and search for food. The whole troop ransacked the kitchen, searching for food items. While most of the gang have their minds on food, Binita, Rani's oldest daughter, decides to do her own survey through the objects, such as utensils and cables, including breaking open a medicine bottle. Eventually the home owners hear the commotion and the troop flee from sight, with some of the gang tagging along their items. With everyone sated, Tarak leads the troop back to the temple for the evening, but one member did not make it back home. During the flee from the apartment, Kavi made a mistake of taking to the electrical wires networking around the streets and unfortunately he suffered a massive electrical shock. He is still alive but severely injured and vulnerable. =Episode 2: Fang's Market= As the drought continues, the Galta Gang have to make forays into the city in search of feeding opportunities as supplies at their temple are running out. Alpha male Tarak leads his troop to the city's main food productions, but stealing may lead to casualties with the people referring to the city's monkey catcher as they grow less tolerant of thieving macaques stealing what little food is left. The troop need to keep a low profile as to not attract attention to themselves. Meanwhile, Kavi is in deep trouble after suffering a big electrical shock, but fortunately luck is on his side. A kind human picks up the monkey and takes him to the animal charity 'Help In Suffering', where he is given immediate medical treatment. The vets rehydrate Kavi with fluid and treat his infected wounds, giving him the best chance to pull through. Meanwhile, the rest of the Galta Gang continue their search for food and end up at the city's fruit market. Here, a fresh supply of fruits are easy pickings for the ravenous troop and the Galta Gang begin to stock up on the rich pickings, but the territory has already been claimed by another rhesus macaque troop. The owner of this prime patch is Fang, a large male macaque whose prominent scar gives him a distinguishing feature. Fang and his formidable troop are fiercely protective of their territory, because it is the most valued real-estate within Jaipur's pink city walls with such a supply of food. Fang's troop eventually catch site of the Galta Gang and a brief but decisive battle takes place, sending the Galta Gang to flee. At the animal charity 'Help In Suffering', Kavi gets nurtured and looked after by the animal carer Saresh Valmiki and starts to make small attributes of pulling through to recovery. The Galta Gang survives the clash with Fang and returns to the Temple but, if the drought continues, they risk going into the city again and facing Fang and his formidable gang at their food-supplying market. =Episode 3: The Monkey Catcher= The Galta Gang is finding that life at the top can be tough. Tarak's queen Rani, baby Esha and the rest of the troop are hungry. The drought is taking its toll, with less worshippers handing out food to the monkeys at the temple. With his troop becoming more restless, Tarak has a crisis on his hands: there is a rebel in his ranks. Zamir, nine- year-old subordinate male, is one of the highest ranking males in the troop and has his eye on the alpha male position. Another threat closer to home are the troop's envious neighbours, the langur monkeys. These agile monkeys thrive on the forest leaves which macaques find inedible. They are after the temple's fresh supply of water at the spring pool. Meanwhile, Tarak leads the troop into the city in search of feeding opportunities and, while most of the troop have their eyes on the busy streets, Bipin, Yash and Tito have their eyes on the birds. The trio follow a pair of birds, closely followed by Zamir. The teens don't manage to get anything out of harassing the birds and move on. Zamir spots a cart seller pushing his cart full of food items; when the cart seller leaves, Zamir moves in to help himself to the food, closely followed by the teens. Eventually, Tarak and the rest of the Galta Gang hear the alarm call notifying that food has been found. They waste no time feeding on the food items on the cart before the cart seller spots his stock being eaten by a bunch of thieving monkeys. Most of the troop manage to flee from sight but Zamir gets cornered and lashes out to scratch the cart seller. The injured cart seller calls the city's monkey catcher who is soon hot on the gang's trail. He sets up a trap near the temple and fills it with food items to tempt the monkeys to take the bait. At the animal charity 'Help In Suffering', Kavi has been under the care of animal carer Saresh Valmiki since being found lying in the city after suffering an electric shock. He is given fresh food and accommodation daily, unlike the Galta Gang who have to deal with food shortages. Kavi makes substantial progress but still has a long recovery to go. Meanwhile, back at the temple, the Galta Gang have more pressing concerns: the langurs take the chance and invade the temple, but alpha male Tarak leads the Galta Gang into the defence of their precious temple and send the langurs to flee, though in the chase the troop once again find themselves in the city streets. On their way back, the troop come across the monkey catcher's trap and, while most of the more experienced individuals keep at a safe distance despite the food inside the trap, curiosity gets the better of the teens; Yash, Tito and several of the gang get captured. Bipin managed to escape the capture. The captives get shifted into small cages and are driven away for relocation. The monkey catcher's real target, Zamir, manages to escape; it is because of his act of scratching the cart seller that an innocent band of troop members were captured and taken to a forest, miles away from the city of Jaipur. =Episode 4: Taxi Raid= The exiled macaques are released in a faraway forest, where they have to look for ways of survival and the road back to home. At the temple, the monkey catcher refuses to do his job since it's Tuesday, the day of lord Hanuman. Showing his respect, he surprisingly offers food to the troop, which most of the members, especially Bipin, refuse to accept. Many teen members are thirsty and set out the search of water. They finally quench their thirst from a public tap, the only way to heal their pain of hunger to an extent. Tarak, with the responsibility to feed the whole hungry gang, heads towards the city with the gang. A mile away from home, the gang finds a few unguarded taxis, but investigation results in nothing edible available. Sorrowful Tarak gives up the quest, yet Zamir has plans for him and isn't ready to follow the leader. Along with a group of his followers, Zamir gets to a high vantage point where he spots a white taxi left alone along with a window open by its owner. His mistake results in the gang eating away and stealing every eatable in the taxi. It is a humiliating low to Tarak's strength as the leader. The gang returns to the temple. After having a restless night, Bipin, separated from his pair of close friends, wakes up the earliest and begins to stare at the horizon to find out any signs of the safe return of his friends. At 'Help in Suffering', the scenario is very critical as the little Kavi, being heavily wounded by electrical burns, gets one of his wounds infected by parasites. The veterinary team tries its best to cure the macaque. =Episode 5: Skid Row= The exile members spot a house amidst the jungle, but there are no signs of any human activity and, more importantly, food. It is nothing more than an abandoned house. Meanwhile, at the temple, Zamir, while framing more plans to conquer the crown, sees a devotee putting away a coconut in the pond. He takes it and wants to eat it alone, breaking the rule where the primary feeding rights lie with the alpha male. As Tarak senses what is going on, he comes to get his part. On his arrival, Zamir loses his nerve and is left with no other option rather than to flee away. Later on, while Rani and Tarak are spending time together, Binita attempts to kidnap her younger sister, Esha. Thanks to Bipin coming to her rescue, Rani is alerted and leaves no chance for Binita. The troop is hungry with no breakfast. Tarak is left with no source of food within the temple premise and, once again, has to lead the gang towards the city. He would not repeat the mistake of going to the city's fruit market, guarded by his arch rival, Fang. Finding no good place to steal food, the macaques have to find insects in the sand or to steal the birds' food. With no food source, Rani cannot produce breast milk and at worst, may have to abandon Esha. Having lost any hope to see fresh available food, the gang suddenly hears a much familiar sound. It is the sound that Vijay Sharma, a strong devotee of lord Hanuman, makes. He occasionally brings lots of food for the troop. Every member eats, and young Anoop gets the taste of ice-cream for the first time. The only problem is Zamir, whose hopes are shattered as he now cannot challenge Tarak with a satisfied troop. Back at the jungle, the exiles finally find a busy road but are eventually stuck at an intersection, where only one way leads home. =Episode 6: Monsoon Showdown= The monsoons finally break in the city of Jaipur accompanied by a storm, which is not good for Zamir, who has got his eyes on the highest rank. The local people celebrate the festival of Teej, a festival celebrated to welcome the monsoon. Zamir cannot wait anymore. He creates a chaos at the temple, attacking many gang members, including Rani, and almost gets the upper hand over Tarak, until he is attacked by the ferocious and united females of the gang. Facing defeat, he is thrown out of the gang. The chaos results in many gang members left heavily wounded, and the death of a baby macaque. Meanwhile, the exile monkeys are already going along the road and, after demonstrating their brilliant sense of directions and a ten-mile long trek, they are finally back in the city. Going through the street mazes, they reach the temple and are welcomed with a bath. Bipin is finally reunited with Yash and Tito, and is back to doing mischief. After all the action, there is a gentle peace at the Galta temple. =Episode 8: Return of the Rebel= Zamir searches for a new troop to lead against his former comrades at the temple, while Kavi waits to see if his family will accept his return. =Episode 9: The Great Escape= While Tarak has had six months of peaceful leadership, his old rivals, the monkey catcher and Zamir, are back in action. Zamir is now a member of a city-based troop led by their leader named Vasu. With his food- finding abilities, Zamir leads a few members to a government office where Sher Singh is in charge. As soon as Sher Singh leaves the office unguarded, Zamir sends in minor members in search of food and later enters himself. Although they find no food, many confidential public tax-related government documents are thrown out open in the streets. This incident attracts the monkey catcher to the site, setting up cages near the office. The monkey catcher now has his own supporting team consisting of his family members. The team waits but sees no monkey to be trapped. Meanwhile, at 'Help In Suffering', Suresh Valmiki makes another attempt to reunite Kavi with the rest of the gang, having already fail in an earlier try. Kavi is left out in a cage where Bipin and many others try to investigate the familiar face. After some time, Kavi finally loses his fear and is set free by Suresh. By the time Suresh bids him farewell, he quickly runs away somewhere unseen between the streets. Some of the gang members try to chase him but he is too fast to be caught. It remains unknown why Kavi had to run away. In the other part of the city, the monkey catcher is desperate to catch the infamous Zamir, one of his oldest targets. The monkey catcher's search for him leads to the city's grain market, where Vasu, Zamir and rest of the troop are set with a big plan in their minds. On spotting the macaques, the monkey catching team is set in action and cages are set up high on the roofs of the market. One of the members of the team hides near a cage in an oil container. Zamir precisely knows the plans of the team and cleverly decides to stay away from the traps. However, Vasu and some of the powerful males of his troop are caught in a trap, leaving Zamir's troop without an alpha male. Vasu is taken far away from the city of Jaipur and left in exile in a forest. =Episode 10: Trading Places= Vasu and the other trapped macaques are released in a forest far away from Jaipur, where they meet many other macaques that have been similarly caught and released from Delhi. While in the city, Vasu's 50-member troop is left with newly recruited Zamir as the only powerful male being capable enough to be the leader. A new day starts and Zamir already has plans to take the position. But he must prove it. He has to find a source of food for his troop. He leads the troop towards the city's fruit market, being unaware it's the area of the formidable Fang. Yet early in the morning, neither Fang nor any of the fruit-sellers are seen in the market as the market hasn't opened yet. At the Galta temple, members of the Galta Gang have now stopped any further investigation about Kavi, and are instead roaming in the city, facing the monkey catcher and his team. Meanwhile, in the forest, Vasu and his fellows find a road and start going along its ends, in the hopes of returning to the city and reuniting with the separated troop. In the city, Zamir finds no food available to loot as he leads the troop to a gem store where they once again find nothing edible and only beautiful gems. At the same time the Galta Gang takes shelter in a busy Hanuman temple amidst the city, where the gang is free from all the dangers of the monkey catching team, as in a Hanuman temple, monkeys are respected and devotees would oppose their catching. The devotees present at the temple also offer fruits to the gang, although Binita is interested in stealing away sandals of devotees. Meanwhile, at the gem store, Zamir flees away with his troop after creating chaos, leaving Fang and his troop at the scene. Zamir now tries his luck in a hotel, and succeeds as he finds the food store of the hotel, where plenty of food items are stored. Zamir's troop members eat away everything present, and happily accept Zamir as their new leader. Zamir celebrates the victory with alcohol drinks. At 'Help In Suffering', the team on duty gets a call regarding an injured macaque, putting Suresh Valmiki in fear as he assumes it might be Kavi. The team rushes towards the site, finds a macaque and quickly returns to the base. At the base it is revealed that the macaque they bought was an injured female along with a newborn baby. The female was left alone and separated by her troop. Suresh is happy to see it's not Kavi. But Kavi is finally seen in the city, where he meets none other than Zamir. Being away from the Galta Gang for months, Kavi is unaware of the fact that Zamir is no more a part of the gang and has a troop of his own. Zamir seems happy to see Kavi, and happily recruits the young macaque in his newly acquired gang. =Episode 11: Rising Forces= Animal caretaker Suresh tries to nurse a mother monkey and her baby back to health, but it is proving difficult. Zamir plots an attack on Tarak and the temple troop, but the attack is foiled. =Episode 12: Heroes & Villains= Esha gets lost in the city. Zamir and his troop launch their attack on the temple, but Tarak and the loyal Kamal mount a strong defense. =Episode 13: A New Dawn= The gang gains several new faces. But in the wake of the great battle, Tarak is seriously injured, and the troop wonders who will replace him. Season 2 =Episode 1: Divided We Stand= As the troop expands and the economy plunges, scarce offerings at the temple leave the macaques competing with each other for sustenance. =Episode 2: Hard Times= The Galta Gang splits into two troops, with Bipin, Yash and Tito leading the splinter group into the city‚Äîand into the traps of the monkey catcher. =Episode 3: Searching For Sanctuary= Rani and the temple troop rely on handouts, while Bipin and the exiles search for a new base. As prospects dim, the suddenly find a ray of hope. =Episode 4: Urban Exile= While Jaipur overrun by langurs, the splinter group must try every trick in the book to locate food. In a faraway forest, Zamir reappears. =Episode 5: Street Life= The remaining Galta troopers leave the temple when offerings dry up, but a close encounter with the monkey catcher sends them scurrying back home. =Episode 6: Home Hunters= While the Galta Gang are off looking for food in town, the watching troop of langur monkeys take their chance and take over the Temple. When the gang return, they fight to reclaim their home, but they are out- numbered and when gang leader Kamal runs away; the troop have little choice but to leave. =Episode 7: Beggars Banquet= Homeless and on the streets, the Galta Gang hear Temple bells. Recognising this as the sound of food, they follow the sound and find a small park. The gang think they have found a new home, until another troop turns up. This is the bachelor gang, and they sidle up to the females. Kamal is paying undivided attention to his food and isn't noticing what's going on. When he does, the rest of the gang sense a fight is coming. But Kamal is scared to fight anyone and he turns and leaves. The rest of the gang follow. =Episode 8: Cops and Robbers= Locals call the police over the antics of the Galta Gang, which brings a policeman to the area, who specialises in advising residents how to protect their property from monkey thieves. When he leaves his radio unguarded behind him on a ledge, Binita spots it, sneaks up and steals it. The policeman gives chase and calls in the monkey-catching team, headed by the monkey catcher. Before the catchers arrive, the gang steal a turban and some pretty cloth, and play dress-up until Kamal spots the catchers and raises the alarm. The gang run in every direction, and once they have escaped, Rani realises that Teejay is not with them, but it is not safe to return to the ground to search for him. She can only wait and worry: with 4,000 macaques on the prowl in the city, young macaques need their mothers to keep them safe, especially one as playful and adventurous as Teejay, but night falls with no sign of him. Zamir returns to Jaipur after eight months in the bush, after having been removed by the monkey catcher. After initial confusion about his location, he finds his bearings and sees his old home in the distance. =Episode 9: Missing In Action= The Galta Gang elite are still homeless and Teejay is still missing, but Kamal finds them a potential new home with an abundance of food and no obvious threats. The grain depot has bags of food that the gang can eat, and the staff don't seem to be bothered by them at all. While Kamal is pleased with himself, Rani is still concerned: she knows that if something seems too good to be true it probably is. Suddenly a monster-sized langur comes to scare them away. This odd looking predator is a 42-year-old mime artist whose job it is to scare away monkey gangs, and he is very effective. Kamal is the first to bolt, leaving his unprotected gang to escape for themselves, which they do. Now on the streets again, Rani needs Kamal's protection more than ever before, but he is nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, without anyone to rein in his behaviour, Teejay is playing acrobatics on the city's maze of power lines. Eventually, remembering he is all alone, he sees his old home in the distance, the Temple. He hurries there, but instead of finding familiar faces, he finds a new gang there, the large pack of langurs. Surrounded, Teejay initially panics, but the young langurs want to play and groom, and the senior langurs don't mind at all. When Zamir turns up, there is a commotion as the langur pack prepare to defend their home, but Zamir recognises that he is outnumbered and leaves. Seeing Zamir reminds Teejay that he must find his family, so he too takes off. Unfortunately, his reckless climbing on wires finally takes its toll as he is electrocuted and falls into a dried out water trough, which cushions his fall but hides him from pilgrims who could help him. =Episode 10: Drug Raid= Kamal leads the gang to a market, but they come face to face with their former underlings, the splinter group that they chased off from the temple. The splinter group, led by Devdin and including Bipin, Yash and Tito, are well fed and strong. Rani knows that the tables have turned and, while the youngsters of each group initially play, Rani calls them off as this is no time to play. Kamal then flees, and the Galta Gang know that their chance of taking over this market has gone with him, so they flee also. Needing to redeem himself, Kamal finds an empty room at the local hospital, and though the gang can't open the child-proofed medicines, they still feast on several available medical products, including sweet cough syrup. Chased off by hospital staff, the gang are nonetheless happy with themselves, especially Kamal who is finally starting to feel like a leader. However, the hospital staff have called the monkey catcher and he and his team manage to cage Kamal, leaving Rani and her gang alone and vulnerable. Zamir had spotted his former gang and had hoped to try his luck for a third time to takeover the gang, but before he could approach them, he sees the monkey catcher and leaves before he too is a target for capture. Lost baby Teejay, suffering terrible injuries from a big shock from a power cable, is found by locals, one of whom takes the small monkey to the animal charity 'Help in Suffering'. He is in critical condition and may have suffered internal organ failure, so he is medicated and left in a recuperation cage overnight, with worker Suresh looking after him. =Episode 11: The Curse of the Jade Monkey= The monkeys are in trouble again, and it is effecting the whole gang. Hapless monkey-catcher Habu and his dimwitted hound Zuzu finally seem to have the Galta Gang outwitted and outmatched at an abandoned meat packing plant downtown. Zamir, still reeling from the realization that his father is still alive, leads the whole gang around a blind corner and into Habu's waiting trap. =Episode 12: An Unlikely Hero= Rani finally comes face to face with her arch enemy, Zamir. He scares off the bachelors and takes charge. The Galta Gang elite launch an attack on the splinter's troop market. But Zamir is distracted and abandons the assault.

Traditional historiography Almost no archaeological work was done at Windsor Castle until the 20th century. As a result, most studies of the castle depended upon architectural analysis and historical research. The most prominent book on the castle, Sir William St John Hope's 1913 volumes, had almost no archaeological evidence to draw on when analysing the castle's history. Modern investigations 1895 investigation An archaeological investigation into the site of the Great Hall in the Lower Ward of the castle occurred in 1895.Brindle and Kerr, p.4. 1970s investigation An archaeological investigation into St George's Chapel at the castle took place in the late 1970s. 1988-92 investigation In the late 1980s it was discovered that the motte beneath the Round Tower was in danger of collapse. In advance of strengthening works, a major archaeological investigation into the design and structure of the building and mound took place between 1988-92. 2006, Big Royal Dig Windsor Castle was one of three royal sites excavated over four days on behalf of Channel 4's archaeological television programme Time Team from 25 to 28 August 2006. It was undertaken by Oxford Archaeology. In the United Kingdom, Channel 4 devoted an evening television program to each day's findings, presented by Tony Robinson, and also followed the dig live on More4, together with a simulcast on the internet. Timed to help celebrate the 80th birthday of Queen Elizabeth II, along with many other events ongoing throughout 2006, this marked the 150th dig conducted by Time Team. For the first time, the Queen gave permission for trenches to be dug in the Garden of Buckingham Palace, as well as in Windsor Castle and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, Edinburgh. The Big Royal Dig is an example of the Queen opening up her homes for greater access to the public, as she did during her Golden Jubilee Weekend in 2002 and throughout 2006 for her birthday. The archaeologists had an unprecedented opportunity to probe the geophysics and history of three royal residences over a four-day period, with teams working concurrently in the three locations. Windsor Castle was the scene of two remarkable finds: *In the Upper Ward, the foundations of the Round Table building erected in 1344 by Edward III were discovered, and also, among other finds, a spectacular decorated mediaeval tile in situ. In Edward's day the Round Table building, 200 feet (60 m) in diameter, was used for feasting, festivals, and theatrical re-enactments of the Knights of the Round Table of Arthurian legend. *In the Lower Ward, the Great Hall of Henry III's palace was located and one of its walls, still standing, was found. This has assisted archaeologists in assessing where Windsor's first palace actually stood. These finds have added to knowledge of the location, history, and uses of the Round Table and the Great Hall. Bibliography *Brindle, Steven and Brian Kerr.

Medieval and Tudor periods Windsor Castle originally became a royal residence because of the protection it could afford to Henry I.South, p.35. Successive medieval and Tudor monarchs made use of the castle during revolts, plagues and other crises, including Henry VIII and Elizabeth I.Rowse, pp.52-3, p.61. Georgian and Victorian periods By the 1740s, security at Windsor Castle had diminished markedly and the site had become an early tourist attraction; wealthy visitors who could afford to pay the castle keeper could enter and stroll around the castle.Tite, p.110; Robinson, p.60. As the condition of the State Apartments continued to deteriorate, even the general public were able to regularly visit the property, with children and others playing in the castle yards.Robinson, p.59. George III gradually reversed this trend when he came to the throne in 1760.Robinson, p.57. This trend continued during the reign of Queen Victoria, when the Windsor Castle and Town Approaches Act was passed by Parliament, permitting the closing and re-routing of the old roads which previously ran through the park from Windsor to Datchet and Old Windsor.Tighe and Davis, p.655. These changes allowed the Royal Family to undertake the enclosure of a large area of parkland to form the private \\"Home Park\\" with no public roads passing through it, creating a much more private and secure royal palace than had previously been the case.Tighe and Davis, p.656. Modern day Although this has been less well publicised than Buckingham Palace, security at Windsor Castle has occasionally been breached, most seriously in 2003 when an intruder (the self-styled \\"comedy terrorist\\", Aaron Barschak) \\"gate-crashed\\" the 21st birthday party of Prince William, but most recently in March 2012, when an intoxicated man scaled a fence and got within yards of the Queen's private apartments before being arrested by armed protection officers. Police from the Thames Valley Police and from the Royalty and Diplomatic Protection Department of the London Metropolitan Police provide the main element of physical security. The Windsor Castle Guard of the Foot Guards of the Household Division, provided by a public duties battalion in London, or by the battalion at Victoria Barracks, Windsor, contributes to this. The Foot Guards battalion at Victoria Barracks, a quarter of a mile from the Castle, is supported by the armoured reconnaissance squadron of the Household Cavalry based at Combermere Barracks, Windsor, one mile (1.6 km) from the Castle. In times of emergency at the castle, several hundred soldiers, as well as the FV107 Scimitar Light Tanks of the Household Cavalry, would be able to respond quickly to protect the castle and its occupants. All visitors are asked to go through airport style security, with luggage being X-rayed and persons walking through a metal detector. On 1 June 2007, the castle and its grounds were designated as a protected site for the purposes of Section 128 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. The effect of the act was to make it a specific criminal offence for a person to trespass into the castle or its grounds. References Citations Bibliography *Robinson, John Martin.

He expresses not being bothered by people and listeners, who criticize how he does his music, saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs their opinion. I respect that. Ako [Me], I just do what I love to do‚Äù. Concept and packaging To increase the chance of getting the album noticed, the label used a novel packaging for the album, incorporating a pull-out calendar in the design.

He was keenly interested in mathematics and astronomy and was a founder member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, (elected Fellow on 17 November 1783) to whose Transactions he contributed a paper proving some theorems in geometry. He was Minister of the first charge (St Mary's) in the Parish of Dundee, and used his mathematical abilities and enquiring spirit to compile, in 1792, an exemplary Report on his Parish for the First Statistical Account of Scotland. In 1804 he published an explanation of Kepler's laws of planetary motion. He was very active in social improvements in his parish, organising (in conjunction with Robert Stewart, a surgeon) a subscription for Voluntary Dispensary, and Surgery, which eventually became Dundee Royal Infirmary. Life Small was born on 12 December 1732 in Carmyllie, Angus, the son of Rev. James Small (d.1771), the local minister, and his wife, Lillias Scott. As was normal with the clergy he was from a gentrified background. Robert received his education at Dundee Grammar School. He then studied Divinity at the University of St Andrews graduating BD around 1750. He was elected by the Town Council of Dundee to be preacher in the Cross Church and catechist and took up post on 2 May 1759. He was called to be minister of the first charge of the Parish of Dundee, St Mary's, where he was ordained on 20 May 1761. He was appointed chaplain to the Royal Highlanders (83rd Foot) in 1778. He was awarded an honorary doctorate (DD) by his alma mater in the same year. In 1783 he was a co-founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He was called before the General Assembly to reply to charges that, when ordaining Elders, on 9 September 1798, in his Parish he asked unconventional, surprise questions, and did not require them to subscribe to the Westminster Confession of Faith. He was admonished and warned to be more careful in future. On Thursday 29 May 1800, the Assembly voted to > enjoin Dr Small to be careful hereafter, to testify, by his whole conduct, > that respect for the Standards of this Church, and for the fences wisely > provided by our Ecclesiastical Constitution, against dangerous innovation, > which corresponds to the declaration stated in his defences, as repeatedly > made by him in the Kirk-session of Dundee, that he glorified in the > Confession of Faith. He was reputed to be an excellent classical scholar and an interesting preacher, well versed in natural philosophy and mathematics and was a patron of literature. His brother, William was by profession a physician but seems to was more active in scientific and industrial concerns. He emigrated for a time to Virginia, where he was Professor of Mathematics at the College of William & Mary and tutored Thomas Jefferson, but returned to Britain, carrying a letter of introduction from Benjamin Franklin to the industrialist Matthew Boulton. In turn, Dr Small introduced Boulton to James Watt. Robert Small was an integral part of the Scottish Enlightenment with worldwide connections to the broader Enlightenment. Both the Small brothers played a crucial part in the education of the economist and mathematician William Playfair . Robert, in particular, recommended Playfair to James Watt for the position of draughtsman and assistant. He died on 23 August 1808 . He is buried in the churchyard of St Andrews Cathedral. Family On 24 April 1764 Robert married Jean Yeaman of Blacklaw, daughter of a Patrick Yeaman of Blacklaw, a merchant and twice Provost of Dundee. His children were, Isabel, Lillias, James, Catherine and Agnes. His son, James, is described (in Fasti Ecclesiae) as \\"a manufacturer in Dundee, whose failure in business ruined his father\\".

The battle was fought in three phases, on 23, 25 and 28 April 1430 and ended in Hussite victory. In the summer of 1430, 10,000 Hussites from Moravia invaded Hungary under Velek Koudeln√≠k of B≈ôeznice. The Hussites in Pozsony County looted and set on fire 100 villages.

The Royalists army belatedly arrived; the plan of campaign was a concentrated charge against the Hussite war-wagons. Koudeln√≠k was killed in the battle, and Sigismund's army was forced to flee. In the battle, 6,000 Royalists, Serbian and Hungarian troops, and 8,000 Husites were killed. In 1431 the Hussite army again invaded Upper Hungary, but Mikl√≥s Rozgonyi defeated the Hussites in the battle of Ilava.

Biography He was born in Valencia in 1470. He was a grand-nephew of Pope Alexander VI, and nephew of Cardinal Juan de Borja Lanzol de Roman√≠, el mayor. His father was Pedro Jofre de Lloris, donzell (Caballero) of Valencia. His mother was Isabel de Borja y Navarro de Alpicat, sister of Juan de Borja Lanzol; she was also related to Pope Calixtus III. Francisco served successively as Chamberlain, Prosecretary and Treasurer to Cardinal Rodrigo de Borja, the future Pope Alexander VI, and later the Treasurer-General of the Apostolic Camera. All his later ecclesiastical titles and benefices appear to have been for his own personal gain; he never took holy orders. He was elected Bishop of Terni on 19 March 1498. He resigned the see just over a year later (17 April 1499) in order to get the see of Elne, left vacant by the death of Cesare Borgia. He was transferred to that see on 6 September 1499, occupying it until his death. In November 1499 he was created Provost of Hildesheim.

Pope Alexander VI elevated him as Cardinal deacon in the consistory of 31 May 1503; he was published on 2 June 1503, receiving the title Deacon of Santa Sabina pro illa vice 12 June 1503. He was promoted to Metropolitan Archbishop of Trani and named titular Latin Patriarch of Constantinople on 9 August 1503 (succeeding his uncle Juan de Borja Lanzol de Roman√≠, el mayor); he occupied the see until his death. Borja participated in the first papal conclave of 1503 which elected Pope Pius III, who died shortly thereafter; he also participated in the second conclave of 1503, which elected Pope Julius II.

Argentine went to Ipswich 'in a serving-man's coat,' and afterwards was successively usher and master of Ipswich School, the grammar school in that town. Here he also practised as a physician and read a lecture in divinity. He was created M.D. by the University of Cambridge in 1541. Protestant activism With the accession of Edward VI to the throne of England Argentine participated in the consequential enthusiasm for protestantism. He contributed to the history of printing in Ipswich by inviting Anthony Scoloker to come to the town and establish the first printing press their. Scoloker printed three of Argentine's books in 1548: *Certeyne Preceptes, gathered by Hulricus Zuinglius, declaring howe the ingenious youth ought to be instructed and brought unto Christ, Ipswich, 1548, 8vo; A translation from the Latin of Huldrych Zwingli's The Christian Education of Youth *A ryght notable Sermon made by Doctor Martyn Luther upon the twentieth chapter of Johan of absolution and the true use of the keyes, full of great comforte, Ipswich, 1548, 8vo; a translation, of a sermon, \\"Predigt am Sonntage nach Ostern\\" by Martin Luther dedicated to the courtier Thomas Wentworth *Sermons of the ryght famous and excellent clerke Master Bernardine Ochine, Ipswich, 1548, 8vo; a translation of six sermons by Bernardino Ochino ‚Äì who had recently found asylum in England. The six sermons are: # What thing is God? # How to know God by his creatures. # If Philosophy serves true Theology or divinity and in what manner. # How we ought to use the Holy Scriptures in attaining the knowledge of God. # Of the inconveniences that are happened and dayly happƒì by the abuse of the Holy Scriptures. # If to be good divines it behoved us to have the humaine sciences or not. Catholic activism Although Argentine's patron, Thomas Wentworth, 1st Baron Wentworth, had attained the post of Lord Chamberlain in 1550, he died in 1551 and was succeeded to the title by Thomas Wentworth, 2nd Baron Wentworth. The 2nd Baron originally persuaded the Ipswich elite to declare Lady Jane Grey Queen of England. However, he promptly defected to join the campaign Queen Mary to succeed Edward. Mary was rallying her supporters at Framlingham Castle, and soon had major local support and was welcomed to Ipswich as she made her way to London. Argentine was amongst many local people who followed 2nd Baron Wentworth. Indeed he became a prominent local Catholic activist. In 1555 he became an advocate for the learning of the Arabic language in England. He delivered a lecture at both Oxford and Cambridge universities arguing that the study of Arabic would help the development of medicine. A manuscript of his lecture, Ad Oxonienses et Cantabrigienses pro lingua Arabica beneficio principum restituenda has been preserved in the Bodleian Library. Having lost his wife, he had himself ordained and was conspicuous by his advocacy of Catholic principles, and by persecuting the reformers. He was appointed parish priest at both St Helen's and St Clement's, Ipswich, in 1556. At the same time he continued in his role as schoolmaster at Ipswich School. He was appointed parish priest at both St Helen's and St Clement's, Ipswich, in 1556. At the same time he continued in his role as schoolmaster at Ipswich School. In 1557 he gained two more benefices: St Mary's Whitton and St Michael's Brantham. The later he gained from the sponsorship of Robert Wingfield, an ardent local catholic who had he played host at his Ipswich home to Queen Mary during her journey to London. Argentine is mentioned in Foxe's Book of Martyrs in relation to the persecution of Agnes Wardall in July 1556. Reversion to protestantism Shortly before the death of Queen Mary in 1558 he moved to London, following the accession Elizabeth he retained his rectory by again becoming a protestant. In January 1563-4 he appears to have been living at Exeter, but the statement that he was a prebendary of Exeter and Wells is without foundation. He probably died in 1568, when his rectory at Ipswich became vacant.

This was first attempted by research conducted in 2002.Yi, E., Gilsoo, C., Youngjoo, N., & Casali, J. G. (2002). A Fabric Sound Evaluation System for Totally Auditory-Sensible Textiles. Textile research journal : publication of Textile Research Institute, Inc. and the Textile Foundation, 72, 638-644. Background The experience of wearing clothes is a necessity in life that people need in order to protect their bodies from conditions in the world around them. As part of this experience, the need to feel comfortable and at ease in one's clothes is required by some people, whether it is for health or personal reasons. The levels of comfort from wearing clothes can be determined under three of the five methods of perception. Vision is obviously important for style and appearance in most cultures, as is touch when determining the materials of clothing for specific target audiences, such as children or the elderly. Surprisingly, the sound of clothes is becoming an interesting topic of study for researchers and clothing manufacturers alike, as it has been previously implied that sounds fabrics can make from the daily wear of clothing may contribute to the sensory experience.Bishop, D. (1996). Fabrics: Sensory and Mechanical Properties. Textile Progress, 26, 1-57. In order to determine the levels of comfort that can be achieved from various fabrics, a system that can evaluate the sound levels omitted by these materials would have to be considered and applied. Evaluation In order to deliver the sound evaluation system that has been discussed in this research, the following sound parameters need to be obtained: * The level pressure of total sound (LPT) * Sound colour factors (‚àÜL and ‚àÜf) * Constants of autoregressive models that are based on the fast Fourier transform algorithm (FFT). These coefficients are ARC, ARF and ARE. * The loudness (z) and sharpness (z) parameters from psychoacoustic models Zwicker, E., & Fastle, H. (2007). Psychoacoustics: Facts and Models. Berlin: Springer Berlin Heidelberg. * Mechanical properties from the Kawabata Evaluation System (KES). To generate these properties, the fabric sounds need to be created in a consistent process. A device was constructed to assist in this effort, known as a measuring apparatus for fabric noise (MAFN). The MAFN creates the sound by rubbing two pieces of fabric together on a belt-pulley. The fabrics are attached to a moveable plate which is connected to two weights suspended on a wire rope. The weights counterbalance to create a pulling effect causing the fabrics to move, creating friction and audible noise levels. A microphone is positioned at the point where the two pieces of fabric make contact in order to capture the best possible sound. In order to record how the sound of fabrics affects human sensations, an evaluation of the sounds created is required from a number of different subjects. In the research phase, thirty university students were asked for their assessment in the form of a questionnaire. The different sounds made by seven different fabrics were to be judged on by seven different attributes, clearness, highness, loudness, pleasantness, roughness, sharpness and softness, in the format of free-modulus magnitude estimation (FMME). A FMME is a method of magnitude estimation. In this example, after listening to the different sounds, participants were asked to give a numerical value to the first sound they heard. Then, based on that value given, they were asked to give a value to the next value. Once all of the values have been given, an average of multiple participants‚Äô can be collated. The end result is the data being presented in a rational scale.Snow, M., & Williges, R. (1998). Empirical models based on free-modulus magnitude estimation of perceived presence in virtual environments. Human Factors, 40(3), 386-402. The psychological characteristics that are categorised in this process are softness, loudness, sharpness, clearness, roughness, highness and pleasantness. In order to establish a connection between these characteristics and the objective measurements that have been recorded from the FMME, stepwise block linear regression is employed as a modified regression model. This is achieved by following the steps that Kawabata proposed in the KESKawabata, S., & Niwa, M. (1989). Fabric Performance in Clothing Manufacture. The Journal of the Textile Institute, 80(1), 19-50. to establish prediction models for primary hand values. The value for each sensation is shown in a table of values in the report with the model applied being shown below: Y=C_0 + \\\\sum_{i=1}^k C_i \\\\frac{X_i-\\\\bar{X_i}}{\\\\theta^i} * Y = sound sensation * X_i = ith objective measurement * \\\\bar{X_i} = mean value of the ith objective measurement or its logarithm * \\\\theta^i = standard deviation of the ith objective measurement or its logarithm * C_0 = the constant * C_i = the coefficient Results The conclusion of the study illustrates that thicker fabrics, such as Melton, showed higher ‚àÜf than thinner ones. Thinner fabrics, such as tropical wool, which are resistant to shearing showed the lowest values for loudness and the highest for ‚àÜL. Most wool is perceived as loud but tropical wool, however, is perceived as clear and pleasant. Similar methods There have been similar lines of research to this method. One attempt studied in particular how the specific sound of fabric being rustled can be unpleasant. This method of evaluation was measured through Multidimensional Scaling analysis, or MSA.Sukigara, S., & Ishibashi, T. (2001). Subjective Evaluation of the Rustling Sound of Fabrics. Sen ºi Gakkai shi, 57, 264-269. Multiple linear regression was also adapted here, which shows that it is a method commonly applied in this field. This method was only applied to one emotion, unpleasantness, whereas the study from Yi, Gilsoo, Youngjoo and Casali in 2002 was able to determine the participant's response from a choice of seven different emotions. A similar studyCho, G., Casali, J. G., & Yi, E. (2001). Effect of fabric sound and touch on human subjective sensation.

It stands on the main High Street of the town and is recognisable by its clock tower. The building is medieval in origin, the earliest part dating from c.1200, and the architecture spans at least five architectural periods, mostly 14th and 15th centuries. The church was altered greatly during the Victorian era, most notably undergoing a restoration by William Butterfield. It is one of the largest churches in Hertfordshire. Because of its proximity to Berkhamsted Castle, St Peter's has had a long association with Royalty, with the reigning monarch acting as patron to Berkhamsted rectors for several centuries. Many members of the congregation also worked in important positions for the Royal household. The church has counted among its worshippers such notable figures as the poet William Cowper and John Incent, who went on to become Dean of St Paul's Cathedral 1540‚Äì1545. The church today has lost its direct royal ties and functions as the main parish church of the town of Berkhamsted. The feast of St Peter is celebrated annually with the Petertide fair. History The sign at the front of the church Richard II, the first Royal patron of Berkhamsted St Peter, from the portrait in Westminster Abbey It is not known exactly when the first church was built on the site of St Peter's, but it is not the oldest church in the area; the church of St Mary in Northchurch, about north-west of St Peter's, is estimated to be Saxon in origin and was mentioned in the Domesday Book (1086). The advowson of a church of Berkhamsted ‚Äì probably that of St Mary's ‚Äì along with the advowson of the chapel of the castle, was granted to the monastery of Grestein Abbey in Normandy sometime between 1087 and 1104 by William, Count of Mortain. It was about this time that the Parish of Great Berkhampstead was created. St Mary's church was originally known as Berkhampstead St Mary and it is thought that it was the original main church in the area until it was superseded by the larger St Peter's after the Norman Conquest, when the focus of political and ecclesiastical power moved south to the area around Berkhamsted Castle. By the 14th century, the town had acquired the name of le Northcherche or Northchurch to distinguish it from St Peter's. Foundation The date of foundation of a church in Berkhamsted town is uncertain; a chapel certainly existed within the walls of Berkhamsted Castle from the 11th century, rebuilt around 1250 by Richard of Cornwall.Birtchnell, p 21 The possibility exists of another town chapel dedicated to St James; this is supported by the fact that for many centuries, the Berkhamsted town fair was held on the feast day of St James rather than at Petertide, suggesting an ancient celebration of the patron saint.Birtchnell, p 29 It is thought that this chapel of St James stood on the present site of the town Post Office. The foundation date of St Peter's is also uncertain, but historians assume it to be around 1222, the year that Robert de Tuardo, the first known rector, was instituted by the Bishop of Lincoln, Hugh of Wells.Birtchnell, p 30 The Parish of Berkhampstead St Peter was originally part of the huge Diocese of Lincoln (Archdeaconry of Huntingdon), until it was transferred in 1843 to Rochester (Archdeaconry of St Albans) and then again in 1877 to the newly formed Diocese of St Albans.Cobb, p114 Medieval St Peter's A brass plaque can be seen inside the church today which lists all the rectors from the 13th century to the present day. The turnover of rectors was especially high in the 14th century, probably due to their lives being cut short by the bubonic plague; between 1369 and 1386, St Peter's had eight successive rectors, the shortest being Thomas Payne, whose tenure lasted only nine days. John de Waltham was rector of St Peter's from 1379 along with a large number of other parishes, as was common at the time. He left after 16 months in office, and was later ordained Bishop of Salisbury in 1388. Waltham enjoyed an especially close relationship with King Richard IIBirtchnell (p.34) notes that \\"scandalous talk of the king's affection for him\\" abounded, possibly comparing Richard's relationship with Waltham to that with Robert de Vere such that, after his death, Richard honoured him with a tomb in Westminster Abbey in the Chapel of Edward the Confessor, the only person not of royal blood to be buried in the royal chapel.Birtchnell, p 34 16th and early 17th centuries Dean Incent's House, depicting John Incent on the sign Brass memorials in the church commemorate Katherine and Robert Incent, two 16th-century parishioners. Robert was the secretary to Cicely, Duchess of York at Berkhamsted Castle. Their son, John Incent, was Dean of St Paul's Cathedral 1540‚Äì1545, and in 1541 he founded the Berkhamsted School. The Incent family house, which still stands on the High Street opposite the church, is today known as \\"Dean Incent's House\\". One rector noted for his long tenure was Rev. Thomas Newman, who was rector for over 40 years from 1598 to 1639. Newman served for a time as a Chief Burgess of Berkhamsted and mayor in 1631.p.28 in Powell, Sumner Chilton. (1963).

After 18 years living in Buckinghamshire, Napier had his own restoration as rector of Great Berkhamsted in 1670 and remained in office until 1681. During his absence, Napier continued to record the baptisms of his own children in the Berkhamsted parish register, signing himself as rector. Although no battles were fought in the area during the Civil War, Berkhamsted lay on the lines of communication between London and Aylesbury and Royalist forces sometimes passed through the parish and soldiers were billeted in local cottages. St Peter's Church was itself caught up in the conflict when, in 1648, it was requisitioned by General Fairfax as a Military prison to hold captured soldiers from the Siege of Colchester. Because the church was full of maimed, hungry soldiers, Fairfax ordered that the church windows be taken out. When the church was eventually returned to parish control, the vestry levied a special tax of twopence an acre on local landowners to pay for replacement windows.Birtchnell, p 101 Another long-standing rector was Napier's successor, Rev Robert Brabant, whose ministry also lasted over 40 years (1681 to 1722). He was also the vicar of Hemel Hempstead and chaplain to Queen Anne. After the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, John Sayer, a member St Peter's congregation was appointed chief cook to King Charles II. Sayer was a wealthy man and lived in Berkhamsted Place and benefactor of the town. He was known to Samuel Pepys, who wrote of him in his Diary. In 1661, Pepys wrote \\"...I went with Captain Morrice at his desire into the King's Privy Kitchen to Mr. Sayres, the Master Cook, and there we had a good slice of beef or two to our breakfast, and from thence he took us into the wine cellar where, by my troth, we were very merry, and I drank too much wine, and all along had great and particular kindness from Mr. Sayres, but I drank so much wine that I was not fit for business.\\" Upon his death in 1682, John Sayer left ¬£1000 in his will for the construction of a row of almshouses on Berkhamsted High Street, containing twelve rooms for the habitation of six poor widows. The endowment also provided for a weekly allowance of two shillings and a fuel allowance for each widow. The almshouses, which are still in existence today, were completed in 1684 and bear an inscription on the front, \\"A gift of John Sayer, 1684\\". Sayer's elaborate marble tomb stands in the Lady chapel of St Peter's.Hastie, p.56 William Cowper The poet William Cowper, son of the Berkhamsted Rector John Cowper (1722‚Äì1756) From 1722 to 1756, Rev John Cowper served as rector of St Peter's; he is noted because he was the father of the poet and hymnodist William Cowper, who was born in Berkhamsted in 1731 and baptised in the church. William Cowper went on to write a number of hymns which became popular in the Evangelical movement and were included in Anglican hymn books such as the English Hymnal. 19th century Charles de Guiffadi√®re, who was rector from 1798 to 1810 and also served as vicar of Stoke Newington, was a reader to Queen Caroline and a popular figure of fun who featured in the humorous journal The Diary of Fanny Burney as the character \\"Mr Turbulent\\". In the 19th century, the Rev John Wolstenholme Cobb documented much of Berkhamsted's past when he wrote his History and Antiquities of Berkhamsted during his time as curate of St Peter's (1853‚Äì55). He then went on to become rector of the parish from 1871 to 1883. St Peter's has also counted among its congregation members of the Dorrien-Smith family who are commemorated by various memorials around the church. Augustus John Smith became the first Lord Proprietor of the Scilly Islands in 1834, and was succeeded by Dorrien-Smiths; George Dorrien was Governor of the Bank of England 1818‚Äì1820; and several members of the Dorrien- Smith family saw active service in the Second Boer War of 1899‚Äì1902. Royal patronage From the installation of Robert de Tuardo, the rectors of the Church of St Peter, Great Berkhamsted were presented by the abbot of Grestein until 1381, when Peter de Burton was presented by King Richard II. This tradition of the reigning monarch acting as patron to each new rector continued more or less unbroken until the 18th century. The last reigning monarch to act in this role for Great Berkhamsted was Charles II in 1681, for the installation of Robert Brabant. At the installation of the next rector in 1722, John Cowper, the duty of patronage was taken on by George, Prince of Wales. From this time, rectors were presented by princes of Wales until Rev James Hutchinson (installed in 1851 with Prince Albert Edward as patron). After the local Duchy of Cornwall estates were sold to the Ashridge Estate in 1862, rectors of Great Berkhamsted were presented by Earls of Brownlow; Hutchinson's successor, Rev John Wolstenholme Cobb, was presented by Earl Brownlow in 1871. Architecture St Peter's in the snow, seen from the north-east, showing (left to right) the chancel, the Lady Chapel, the adjoining north transept and the roof of the north aisle The 13th-century nave with Butterfield's roof, looking towards the west window The church is in a cruciform layout, and measures from the west door to the east window and the width across the transepts is . The oldest part of the church is the chancel which is dated at c.1200, the foundation of the church,Birtchnell, pp 30‚Äì32 and it is in the Early English style common in that period. The transepts, erected during the reign of Edward II are from the Decorated Period.Cobb, p.53 Additions and alterations The architecture of St Peter's belongs to no single period, but extends over about 350 years. Many additions have made to the church over the centuries and subsequent Victorian restorations have changed the fabric of the church substantially. =Expansion 1230‚Äì1546= In the 13th century, construction progressed rapidly westwards, with the nave, transepts and crossing being added in the first few years after the construction of the chancel. In 1230, north and south aisles were added to the nave and the north transept was extended on the eastern side; this extension was later used partly as a vestry, and today serves as the Lady Chapel. On the south side of the Chancel, the chapel of St Catherine was added in 1320, and in 1350 the irregularly angled St John's Chantry was built onto the south aisle for worship by the boys and masters of Berkhamsted School. In 1450 a clerestory was added to the nave, raising its height, and a large timber pillar added to the middle of the St John Chantry. Expansion of the church culminated in 1545-6 when the tower was raised to its current height of , and the church reached its present size. =Decay= Over the years the fabric of the building decayed. On one occasion in the 1700s, the boys and masters had a narrow escape when, moments after they had left the chantry to go into the main body of the church, the main beam gave way and the ceiling collapsed. The event was recorded by one Nathaniel Salmon, who also reported that the disaster had uncovered a set of painted figures on the pillars, possibly medieval in origin, of the Eleven Apostles and Saint George and the Dragon. Salmon noted that they had \\"but lately come to light, having, by the zeal of the last generation, been whited over\\", in reference to the efforts of Puritan iconoclasts of the English Civil War during the previous century. =Wyattville's restoration= The structure of the church continued to evolve; doors were added and blocked up, fittings were installed and moved around and monuments resited and removed. In the 19th century there were major restorations of St Peter's church; the first in 1820, led by Jeffry Wyattville, architect of Ashridge House, was controversial and has been criticised for the destruction of many original features of the building. During the works, churchwardens were involved in removing ancient monuments from the church, and Wyattville covered the outer walls with stucco. The font was moved from the west end to the south porch, and the door was walled up, the Torrington tomb was moved from the nave into the transept, and many old inscriptions were obliterated. The peal of six bells was recast into eight, and a gallery which stood between the tower arches was removed and a new gallery erected at the west end.Cobb, p.56 =Butterfield's restoration= The south transept, raised to its original height and faced in flint by Butterfield In 1870‚Äì71 another restoration programme was carried out by William Butterfield, a Gothic Revival architect whose works included churches such as All Saints, Margaret Street in London as well as an array of church restorations. Butterfield's restoration of St Peter's Church is more positively assessed, although his work also involved the removal of some original features, including the obliteration of the paintings on the pillars. The most substantial structural changes involved raising both the roof and the floor of the chancel, raising the roof of the south transept to its original pitch, removing the vestry, incorporating the south porch into the south aisle and removing the door, re-flooring the nave, installing new oak benches and replacing Wyattville's gallery. Butterfield also installed clear windows in the clerestory, allowing more light to enter the nave. He extended the aisles by knocking down the dividing walls of two chambers at the west end; one of these chambers, in the south-west corner of the nave, was used to house the town fire engine. A door to the right of the great west door had \\"Engine House\\" painted above it on the outside; Butterfield blocked up this door. The flint from these alterations was kept in storage and was later used in the construction of Sunnyside Parish Church in 1909. On the exterior of the church, Butterfield removed Wyattville's crumbling plaster and re-faced the church walls with flint flushwork.Hastie, pp 100‚Äì102 =20th-century re- ordering= Between 1956 and 1960 St Peter's underwent further restoration in which the tower and nave were re-roofed. St Catherine's Chapel and the nave were refurbished and a large mural of the Ascension by Burrows which covered the wall over the tower arch was painted over. The church was also substantially re-ordered, and the high altar and sanctuary area brought forward under the tower crossing. The wooden 15th-century rood screen which separated the nave from the crossing was painted and gilded in a medieval style, and a set of twelve carved figures which had been added in the early 19th century were also painted and mounted higher up the screen. The screen was backed with oak and re-mounted on the back of the new sanctuary area to form a reredos behind the altar, also serving as a dividing wall with the old chancel area which was converted into a vestry area.Cobb, p.132 Nave The late Gothic Revival pulpit dates from 1910 and is decorated with figures of angels, carved by Harry Hems. In the north aisle stands the Parish Chest, a finely carved 17th century wooden chest which contained parish documents. By the corner of the north transept stands the marble tomb of Sir John Cornwallis, a member of the Council of King Edward VI. Sanctuary The gilded reredos The high altar, located under the tower crossing since 1960, is on a raised white marble floor. The gilded reredos, a reworking of the 15th- century rood screen presents the figures of twelve saints. To the left of the sanctuary is the long brass plaque listing the rectors of Great Berkhamsted from 1222 to the present day. Brass memorials on the walls commemorate Rev JW Cobb and his wife. St John's Chantry This chantry chapel was used for worship by the boys and masters of Berkhamsted School until the 19th century, when the school built its own chapel, and was physically separated from the nave by a dividing wall. The chantry is now used for the choir stalls and organ. The present organ was built by Peter Collins or Redbourne in 1986, and replaces an earlier instrument built by Walker. Some of the Walker pipework was incorporated into the modern instrument. The organ has two manuals, the brightly coloured casing is in English oak and decorations are in sycamore wood. The chantry contains monumental brasses commemorating Robert and Katherine Incent, the parents of John Incent. Another brass commemorates John Raven, squire to the Edward, the Black Prince at Berkhamsted Castle. Lady Chapel The Lady Chapel The 14th-century tomb of Henry of Berkhamsted The Lady chapel forms a bright, spacious part of the church dating from the 13th century. It is an extension of the north transept. The interior carving around the windows and arches features ball-flower motif of the Decorated Period. The present windows and the windows of the north transept are good examples of curvilinear tracery, typical of the first half of the 14th century, although the glass is from a later period. Traces of the original window arches are still visible. The Lady Chapel also contains some notable memorials, including the marble tomb of John Sayer, inscribed with the date 1682. Next to the old chancel (now the wooden steps into the vestry) lies a stone tomb which is thought to be that of Henry of Berkhamsted and his wife; the tomb has lost its inscription and the identity of the persons interred within has been in dispute for many years. The tomb has two stone supine effigies on top with hands together in prayer, Henry wearing medieval armour. Henry was Constable to the Black Prince at Berkhamsted Castle in the mid-14th century. St Catherine's Chapel St Catherine's Chapel, dedicated to Catherine of Alexandria, lies to the south of the old chancel adjoining the south transept. Dating from around 1320, it contains two recessed medieval tombs in the south wall, one of which contains a tomb slab decorated with a carved floriated cross. The 16th-century wall monuments commemorate Waterhouse family. The chapel was restored around 1900 and the alabaster reredos ‚Äì a copy of high altar screen in Winchester Cathedral ‚Äì and the stained glass windows date from this period. Chancel The old chancel is used today as a vestry for the choir and clergy. The area still contains fixtures from its days as the sanctuary before the church was re-ordered in 1960, including a large mosaic reredos by Alfred Hoare Powell with a painted crucifixion scene by Burrows. There also several memorials to past worshippers, including one to Ann Cowper, wife of the Rector John Cowper and mother of William Cowper; valedictory lines by the poet in tribute to his mother are engraved on the memorial, ending \\"These lines, though weak, are as herself sincere\\". Tower The clock tower was finished in 1546 and contains a peal of eight bells with a combined weight of . The bells were re-cast in 1837 from the bells dating from 1553 with additional metal by Mears and Stainbrook of Whitechapel. At the same time, a new clock was installed. Windows The windows in St Peter's include some lancets surviving from the 14th century, along with much notable stained glass from renowned Victorian glass makers Heaton and Butler, Clayton and Bell, Charles Eamer Kempe, Nathaniel Westlake and James Powell and Sons.Cobb, p.130 *West window: Perpendicular style tracery, thought to date from the reign of James I, although the glass was replaced after General Faifrax's intrusion during the Civil War. The present stained glass dates from 1866, designed by Heaton and Butler, for which they were awarded a bronze medal at the Paris Exhibition of 1867. *East Window: stained glass in memory of William Cowper, Clayton and Bell, 1872. *Chancel Windows: date from c.1420, featuring coats of arms of the See of Canterbury impaling Chichele, royal arms of France quartered with England. *St John's Chantry windows: arms of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York, 15th century; other windows are 1865‚Äì69 by Heaton and Butler. *St Catherine's Chapel: one of the windows is signed by TF Curtis of Curtis, Ward and Hughes; windows date from the 1900 restoration work on the chapel. *North transept windows: Dorrien Memorial, Powell, 1852. *South transept windows: Curtis Memorial (1872) and Mary window (1874), both Clayton and Bell. *North aisle windows: the windows in the north aisle were 14th- century in origin, and the tracery typifies the transitional style between the Decorated and Perpendicular styles.Cobb, p.53 They now contain Victorian stained glass, including the ubiquitous stained glass copy by Heaton & Butler of William Holman Hunt's painting The Light of the World which now hangs in St Paul's Cathedral, London. A three-light window by Westlake, installed in 1885 in memory of the Berkhamsted sheep dip manufacturer William Cooper, depicts Christ enthroned surrounded by saints and martyrs, including Edward the Confessor and Hugh of Lincoln accompanied by his pet swan.Norris, page 37 A window by Alexander Gibbs was installed in 1872 at the west end of the aisle in memory of Rev F. Bullock who drowned in that year; this was replaced in 2000 with a window by David Peace and Sally Scott marking the Christian Millennium and the bicentenary of William Cowper's death. The clear glass is etched with quotes from Cowper's poetry, images of Berkhamsted and scenes of nature. Churchyard and cemetery Three Close Lane Cemetery commemoration stone, 1842 The graveyard around St Peter's Church contains many old gravestones, most of which were laid flat in the late 19th century, and it now serves as a green. One remaining memorial is a large stone cross at the north- east corner of the church, the Smith-Dorrien Monument, which was erected in 1909 in memory of Mary Ann Smith-Dorrien, wife of Robert Algernon Smith- Dorrien of Haresfoot, a Colonel in the Hertfordshire Militia, and mother of Horace Smith-Dorrien. St Peter's churchyard was originally used for town burials, mostly on the north side of the church, but like many burial grounds in England at the time, it had become overcrowded by the mid-19th century. Some burials were made on the south side of the church, but the widening of the High Street limited the amount of space available. A new cemetery was opened in 1842 on a ground behind the Elizabethan manor, Egerton House (now the site of the Rex Cinema), by Charlotte Catherine Anne, Countess of Bridgewater and widow of John Egerton, 7th Earl of Bridgewater. The cemetery, situated between Three Close Lane and the old St Peter's rectory and known variously as Three Close Lane Cemetery or Rectory Lane Cemetery, was extended in 1921. There are several Commonwealth War Graves in the cemetery from both World War I and World War II, and among the notable burials is the grave of General Horace Smith-Dorrien, a veteran of the Second Boer War and World War I and former Governor of Gibraltar. In 2014 the Rectory Lane Cemetery Project was founded to transform the Cemetery, creating a new community space with an enhanced wildlife domain and restored heritage features. The volunteer group, linked to the Friends of St Peters, secured funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Big Lottery Fund for this scheme in 2017, enabling them to begin a 3-year project restore a neglected area and conserve local heritage for future generations. By the late 1940s the Rectory Lane Cemetery was filling up and a new civic cemetery was opened at nearby Kingshill. The Church today The Parish of St Peter, Great Berkhamsted continues today as an active Church of England parish church. The church holds regular services of Christian worship, and the church choir sings on Sundays during the Eucharist and in a monthly service of choral evensong. The church is also frequently used as a venue for classical music concerts performed by local music groups. The church publishes a monthly magazine, Your Berkhamsted (known until 2010 as The Berkhamsted Review), which has been in existence since 1874. St Peter's is affiliated with two Church of England schools in Berkhamsted, Victoria Infant School and the Thomas Coram School.

Life John Boys was the son of John Boys (b. 1590) of Hoad Court, Blean, Kent, and nephew of Edward Boys, 1599-1677. His mother was Mary, daughter of Martin Fotherby, bishop of Salisbury. He was born about 1614. His grandfather, Thomas Boys (d. 1625), brother of the dean, John Boys, inherited the estate of Hoad Court from his uncle, Sir John Boys, an eminent lawyer, who died without issue in 1612. On 24 Jan. 1659-1660 Boys presented to the mayor of Canterbury a declaration in favour of the assembly of a free parliament, drawn up by himself in behalf (as he asserted) \\"of the nobility, gentry, ministry, and commonalty of the county of Kent\\". But the declaration gave offence to the magistrates, and the author, as he explained in his Vindication of the Kentish Declaration, only escaped imprisonment by retiring to a hiding-place. Several of his friends were less successful. In February 1659-60 he went to London with his kinsman, Sir John Boys of Bonnington, and presented to Monk, at Whitehall, a letter of thanks, drawn up by himself 'according to the order and advice of the gentlemen of East Kent.' He also prepared a speech for delivery to Charles II on his landing at Dover on 25 May 1660; but \\"he was prevented therein by reason his majesty made no stay at all in that town,\\" and he therefore sent Charles a copy of it. Boys married Anne, daughter of Dr. William Kingsley, archdeacon of Canterbury, by whom he had three sons‚ÄîThomas, who died without issue; John, a colonel in the army, who died 4 Sept. 1710; and Sir William Boys, M.D., who is stated to have died in 1744. Boys himself died in 1660-1, and was buried in the chancel of the church of Hoad. Works Boys chiefly prided himself on his classical attainments. In 1661 he published two translations from Virgil's √Üneid. The first is entitled, √Üneas, his Descent into Hell: as it is inimitably described by the Prince of Poets in the Sixth of his √Üneis, London, 1661. The dedication is addressed to Sir Edward Hyde, and congratulates him on succeeding to the office of lord chancellor. His cousin Charles Fotherby, and his friend, Thomas Philipott, contribute commendatory verses. The translation in heroic verse is of very mediocre character, and is followed by 181 pages of annotations. At their close Boys mentions that he has just heard of the death of Henry, duke of Gloucester (13 Sept. 1660), and proceeds to pen an elegy suggested by Virgil's lament for Marcellus. The volume concludes with \\"certain pieces relating to the publick,\\" i.e. on the political matters referred to above, and with a congratulatory poem (dated Canterbury, 30 Sept. 1656) addressed to Boys' friend, William Somner, on the completion of his Dictionarium Saxonico-Latino-Anglicum. Boys' second book is called √Üneas, his Errours on his Voyage from Troy into Italy; an essay upon the Third Book of Virgil's \\"√Üneis.\\" It is dedicated to Lord Cornbury, Clarendon's son. A translation of the third book of the '√Üneid' in heroic verse occupies fifty-one pages, and is followed by \\"some few hasty reflections upon the precedent poem.\\" Boys' enthusiasm for Virgil is boundless, but his criticism is rather childish.

Built in 1898, America sank in Washington Harbor off the shore of Isle Royale in 1928, where the hull still remains. The wreck was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. History America (Official No. 107367) was a steel-hulled ship, built by the Detroit Dry Dock Company and launched on April 2, 1898. The ship was 184 feet long, 31 feet wide, and 11 feet in depth. She had a gross tonnage of 486 tons and a net of 283 tons. She was powered by a triple expansion steam engine and two Scotch boilers, manufactured by the Dry Dock Engine Works, delivering 700HP. Less than a month after her launch, America began a daily run, transporting both passengers and packages on Lake Michigan between Chicago and Michigan City, Indiana. The ship remained on this run until 1901; in 1902 she was purchased by the Booth Steamship Company and transferred to service in Lake Superior. There, the ship served as a communications link for the western portion of Lake Superior, running three voyages per week among Duluth, Minnesota, Isle Royale, and Thunder Bay, Ontario and numerous small communities in between. The ship carried supplies in and fish catch out, as well as moving both mail and passengers. America had a number of accidents; the first one barely two weeks after she arrived in Duluth, when the ship ran into an ice floe and stove in her bow. In 1904, she ran too close to the steamer Edwin F. Holmes, destroying five staterooms, and in 1909 she ran aground. In 1909, the Booth Steamship Company failed and a new company, the Booth Fisheries Company, took over operation of the failed company's assets, including America. In 1911, America was lengthened to 183 feet, increasing the gross and net tonnages to 937 tons and 593 tons respectively. The beam and depth remained the same. The rework added 12 more staterooms, bringing the total to 51, of which 43 were reserved for passengers. In 1914, management of the ship was taken over by the United States & Dominion Transportation Company, a subsidiary of Booth. Also in 1914, America again ran aground, taking considerable damage. On 7 June 1924, she struck a reef, capsized, and sank off Isle Royale, Michigan; all 47 people aboard survived, and she was refloated, repaired, and returned to service. In 1926, she collided with another steamer, and in 1927 rammed the dock and grounded while coming into port. Wreck Mooring at America America from above On June 6, 1928, America steamed out of Duluth on her normal route. She arrived in Isle Royale's Washington Harbor in the early morning hours of June 7 to drop off passengers, and left again before dawn. Once the ship had cleared the dock, the captain turned over the helm to the first mate. Five minutes later, America hit a submerged reef as she was leaving Washington Harbor. Although the captain returned to the helm and attempted to beach her, America ran aground on a second reef. All 16 passengers and 31 crew aboard were successfully transported to lifeboats. Within an hour, America slowly settled to the bottom in the north gap of Washington Harbor, leaving only her forward deck and wheelhouse above the waterline. Efforts were made to re-float the ship, but the bidding process was delayed, and a salvage company was not lined up until 1929. Over the winter of 1928-29, the wheelhouse was sheared off and the ship was shifted by the ice to sit lower in the water. By that time, it was thought that raising the wreck would not be financially feasible, and indeed, the salvage company was never able to raise the capital required to raise the wreck. A group of divers in the 1960s attempted to raise America and bring her to Duluth for service as a museum ship. However, this later attempt was also unsuccessful due to Lake Superior storms and, it was rumored, sabotage by a diver who wanted America to stay where she was. The wreck today America lies along a steep underwater cliff, with the wreckage sitting as deep as 85 feet to as shallow as only two feet to the surface, and can be easily seen by visitors arriving in Washington Harbor. The ship lies about 190 feet from Isle Royale. The hull is completely intact, as are the belowdeck cabins and the stern. The forward part of the superstructure is missing due to the elements and salvage operations. The effects of winter ice can be seen as far down as 30 feet below the surface, and alterations to the vessel from earlier salvage attempts are apparent. America is one of the most popular wrecks for diving in Isle Royale National Park, with over 210 dives in 2009 out of 1062 dives made to wrecks in the park. The pressure from the number of dives and the lake motion near the surface has caused the wreck to deteriorate. Nearly all portable objects have been stripped from the wreck by souvenir-hunting divers. The Isle Royale National Park has formed an informal partnership with the Great Lakes Shipwreck Preservation Society (GLSPS) to preserve and monitor America. In 1996, the GLSPS repaired one of the ship's walls, and they have reattached other pieces and otherwise worked to stabilize the ship. One of the Americas lifeboats was on display at the America dock in Snug Harbor in the Rock Harbor Channel on Isle Royal, but was washed into the lake in 2017.

Formation Following a childhood in Paris and the Auvergne, Antoine de Margerie lived with his parents in a number of diplomatic postings, in Madrid, Washington, Rome and Berlin. In 1953, he joined his grandfather Andr√© Lefebvre de La Boulaye, another diplomat, in Paris. At the Lyc√©e Saint-Louis-de- Gonzaque, he obtained his bacalaureat. Art is already part of his background because an uncle, Paul de Laboulaye (1902‚Äì1961) is a painter who encourages the adolescent Antoine in his interest. One of the artists whose paintings hang in the family apartments is Pierre Bonnard. Another family member, Paul- Antoine, known as Paul de la Boulaye (1849‚Äì1926), had also been a painter. Antoine de Margerie felt drawn to the vocation, causing his parents worry. In order to reassure them, de Margerie takes up medical studies, as well as pursuing a humanities degree and taking courses at the √âcole du Louvre and the Institut d'Art et d'Arch√©ologie at the Sorbonne. In 1964 he made the difficult decision to take up painting exclusively. In 1964 he married Anne Guillet, whom he met at the √âcole du Louvre, and they subsequently have two daughters, Constance and Isabelle. They lived in Paris until 1991, when he buys a house in Sandihac in the Gard and spends half the year there. He died in Paris in 2005. Geometric Abstraction Antoine de Margerie started painting in his childhood. At 12, he handled his brushwork with skill. Initially figurative, this figuration quickly becomes stylised with carefully delineated contours and bold colours. Increasingly exuberant, his manner became freer, almost joyful. In his thirties, de Margorie shifted to abstraction, an inspired geometry (as with Mondrian or Malevitch) replacing his youthful lyricism. The painted curve becomes progressively more absent from his design, to be replaced by the signal language of constructivism. Controlled and planned, the work is a cerebral exercise. The impulsive impetus all but disappears, to be replaced by a 'rigorous obstinacy' that nevertheless reveals a highly motivated artist. Work and its reception * According to Antoine de Margerie: 'Pastels, watercolours, paintings or engravings, the same applies: constructed elements, a limited range of motifs and not more than one per canvas! Like others I began figuratively, but in my landscapes it was the edge of fields and the horizon that attracted me. In still life, it was the table rather than what was on it and in interiors, doors, walls and cupboards. It's probably how I slipped into abstraction. One area of research in painting led to another, and so on.' * According to Jacques Bouzerand: ' The spirit dominates matter in de Margerie's painting. The brain masters impulses from the heart and the body. Reflecting on and analysing space precedes any gesture of the paintbrush, which remains discreet because it is but a servant of the painted. In the 'battle of line and colour' as theorised by Yves Klein, de Margerie has not gone just for colour, he has accepted rule by the line. * According to Anne Tronche, the artist's biographer: 'Everything concurs towards a slow but supple rhythm, as if by the use of abstraction. the treatment undergone by the painting is that of a living organism with its own logic. The artist imagines subtle monochromes, or perhaps breaks up a monochrome tendency with the disequilibrium created by a striking colour contrast. * According to Guy Lanoe, President of the Salon des R√©alit√©s Nouvelles from 1995 to 2004: 'Painter and engraver, de Margerie starts with a spatial geometry using long lines or curves. These delimit flat planes, where blacks and greys dominate, zones of silence where emotion seems absent. This is the result of a constant emptying out, revisited time and again, an anxious and unremitting questioning. But this rigour and precision does not result in those all too perfect prescriptions which freeze discourse. In the middle of muted tones, reds, blues and oranges make their appearance and thereby announce the blossoming of colour'. * According to Jacques Tournier, writer: 'I discover a conscious, carefully directed work which continues without fail to the last, luminous canvases. What strikes me most, if I flip rapidly through the book, is how the coloured line evolves (most evidently in the last pages) towards a luminous red, before slowly darkening to sombre, black canvases; then lightening again to transparent, almost secretive whites in all their splendour'. Salon des R√©alit√©s Nouvelles In 1972, de Margerie joined the committee of the Salon des R√©alit√©s Nouvelles. In the nineties he became a member of the administration, occupying the post of treasurer. Declining the post of president in succession to Jacques Busse, he retained his treasurer's position. Antoine de Margerie's work appeared in 25 solo exhibitions and many group shows such as the Venice Biennale, the Salon de Mai and the Salons Comparisons. His work is in public and private collections in France and internationally.

He became famous as the officer who kicked a football into No Man's Land at the start of the Battle of the Somme.  Early life  Wilfred Percy Nevill was born at Canonbury Park in London on 14 July 1894 to a coal merchant father. He was one of four brothers and three sisters, raised at homes in Westgate-on-Sea and Twickenham. He went to school at Dover College, where he was head prefect as well as captain of the cricket and hockey teams. He also played in the 1st XV for the rugby team and ran in the running team first team. After completing his studies at Dover he went up to Jesus College, Cambridge in 1913 to study the Classical Tripos. He demonstrated his sporting abilities at university, playing hockey for the college. An annual report from the period states that Nevill was ‚Äúonly one freshman worthy of his colours‚Äù. The Jesus College magazine, The Chanticlere, describes Nevill's style of play - Nevill had been at Cambridge University for a year when war was declared. In that year he had enjoyed trips by motorcycle, watched Wimbledon tennis champion A.F. Wilding in and exhibition match and witnessed Gustav Hamel flying over the city.  First World War  Prior to the war Nevill was a member of the Cambridge University Officer Training Corp and attended the 1914 summer training camp at Mytchett. He enlisted in November 1914 and was promoted to Captain and signed up to service with the regular army. Writing to his sister just prior to the Battle of the Somme, Nevill describes his experience of being under artillery bombardment:  Battle of the Somme  Nevill joined the East Yorkshire Regiment but transferred to the East Surrey Regiment and was the originator of the East Surrey‚Äôs famous ‚ÄúFootball Charge‚Äù on the first day of the Battle of the Somme, 1 July 1916. On the first day of the Battle of the Somme, the 8th Battalion Royal East Surrey Regiment left their trenches at Carnoy to attack German at Montauban positions 300 yards away. There were some reports that four balls were uses, one for each company of the 8th Battalion. However, historians conclude that the evidence available points to there only being two used. He and his fellow officers were concerned about how their men would behave when finally called on to go over the top. To provide his soldiers with a reassuringly familiar symbol, Nevill bought the footballs while on leave in London and took them back with him to France. A fellow officer, Second Lieutenant C.W. Alcock, wrote to Nevill's sister - Nevill died on the first day of the Battle of the Somme, just two weeks short of his 22nd birthday. He fell in front of the German barbed wire, shot as he was about to throw a hand grenade.\\"The Football Charge of 8th Bn The East Surreys at The Somme\\" www.queensroyalsurreys.org.uk. Retrieved 18 December 2010. Alcock in writing to Nevill's sister, said of her brother - Writing to Nevill's mother, Major A.P.B. Irwin paid this tribute - Nevill rests at Carnoy Military Cemetery (grave ref. E.28) under the care of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.  Press Coverage  \\"Touchstone\\" of The Daily Mail penned the following verse in tribute: :On through the hail of slaughter, :Where gallant comrades fall, :Where blood is poured like water, :They drive the trickling ball. :The fear of death before them, :Is but an empty name; :True to the land that bore them, :The SURREYS played the game. The Daily Telegraph of 12 July 1916 ran the headline, GALLANT EAST SURREYS. A CHARGE WITH FOOTBALLS and gave the following account -  The Footballs Today  One of the balls is currently displayed at the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment Museum at Dover Castle. The other is believed lost after a fire the Queen's Royal Surrey Regimental Museum at Clandon Park, Guildford in 2015.

European Policy  Strategic contributions on a European level Members and senior officers of EDEN have frequently been contributing to policy initiatives, important publications, comprehensive European actions during the past years. A selection of relevant achievements can be read below. The book \\"E-Learning in Europe ‚Äì Learning Europe: How new media contributed to the development of higher education?\\", published in 2005 in the series \\"Medien in der Wissenschaft\\" gives a survey about the past present and future of e-learning in twelve European countries. EDEN representatives have contributed with different chapters, including the concluding one about \\"European E-learning from Supranational Perspectives\\", by Claudio Dondi, Andras Szucs and Erwin Wagner. The developments in different European countries were discussed at the conference \\"New Educational Benefits of ICT in Higher Education\\", in Rotterdam in 2002. The national cases were included in the book \\"The Use of ICT in Higher Education ‚Äì A Mirror of Europe\\". EDEN contributed with a thought-provoking paper on the expectations, opportunities, achievements and realities regarding ICT, e-learning and ODL in Central and Eastern Europe. The 2004 Annual Conference in Budapest \\"New Challenges and Partnerships in an Enlarged European Union\\" put in focus the issue of efficient and beneficial European integration and the core question: how distance and e-learning can best play a role in capacity building and support modernisation. The topic of the Third EDEN Research Workshop in Oldenburg, in 2004, inspired the publication on \\"Learner Support in Open distance and Online Learning Environments\\", in the ASF Series on Distance Education, addressing the latest in theory, practice, research and evaluation in the field. The Second EDEN Research Workshop, organised in Hildesheim in 2002, was entitled \\"Research and Policy in Open and Distance Learning\\". The Workshop dealt with the relation of research and comprehensive aspects of Open and Distance Learning and e-learning, focusing on policy and strategy issues. An interesting collaboration with UNESCO Information Society Division resulted the project, entitled \\"Higher Education Open and Distance Learning Knowledge Base for Decision Makers\\". EDEN has also taken an active part in the Socrates Minerva ODL project \\"How to build up European ODL Networks\\", a comparative analysis of the different distance education networks in the European countries. In co-operation with EADTU, a well-received study was prepared, entitled \\"The Role of Advanced Information Technology in the Development of Distance Education Networks in Central and Eastern Europe\\". EDEN representatives were invited to co-ordinate two important policy studies: The Relationship between Distance and Mainstream Education, for the International Commission on Education for the Twenty-First Century (UNESCO), and a Policy Paper on Open and Distance Learning. Feasibility studies were realised by EDEN for Distance Education in the Czech and Slovak Republic, Hungary, Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and an important paper on the Development of a Regional Distance Education Network in Central and Eastern Europe, using TEMPUS and PHARE funds, and in co-operation with EADTU.

Mei utilises mostly dark tones, and although the main figure is hugely imposing to the viewer, the overall mood is sombre and melancholy.

In 1954, he was a co-founder of the Iconomaques group of abstract artists in Luxembourg.\\"Emile Kirscht\\", Luxemburger Lexikon, Editions Guy Binsfeld, Luxembourg 2006. Early life Born on 11 June 1913, he was the sixth of seven children in a working-class family in Rumelange in the south of Luxembourg. His father died when he was only four, forcing him to earn a living in a steel mill from an early age. During the Second World War, the Germans deported him after his refusal to join the Volksdeutsche Bewegung but they later brought him back to work in the Belval steel factory where he remained for the rest of his working life. Without any formal education, he started to paint as a child using a paintbox he had found in a dustbin. He developed his own abilities from the 1940s, soon to be influenced by the lyrical abstract imagery of the Paris School after he went to the 1947 exhibition of French art in Luxembourg City.\\"Emile Kirscht\\" , Mediart-lu.

Style Kirscht first exhibited at the Cercle artistique de Luxembourg in 1947 where he met Joseph-Emile Muller who, together with other Luxembourg painters, encouraged him to exhibit at the 1950 Salon de la Nouvelle Equipe in Esch-sur-Alzette and at the 1954 Salon des Iconomaques. By 1959, his abilities were fully recognized when he was awarded the Prix Grand-Duc Adolphe. Although Kirscht turned to abstract painting in the 1950s with works such as Composition and Automnal, it was not until the early 1960s when he substituted acrylics for oils that he truly mastered the style. One of his most notable works, Village (1959), makes use of geometrical forms to represent the internal lines and structures of the topic. The interaction of the different yet harmonious colours are the basis of the structures in his works. In each painting, there is an underlying colour, the proportion of white diminishing ever more as his approach matures.Guy Wagner, \\"Emile Kirscht: Le chemin de l'abstraction\\" .

It premiered at the Portland Stage Company in Portland, Maine in 2004 where it broke box office records and garnered critical acclaim. Cariani later adapted the play into a book of the same name. Scenes There are eleven short scenes: * Prologue - Pete & Ginette A couple explores the distance between them. * Her Heart - East & Glory Glory finds herself in East‚Äôs yard as she waits for the Northern Lights. * Sad and Glad - Jimmy & Sandrine Sandrine enters an awkward situation after running into an ex. * This Hurts - Steve & Marvalyn An unlikely friendship begins with an incident in the laundry room. * Getting It Back - Lendall & Gayle Gayle wants the love she gave Lendall back. * Interlogue - Pete Pete missed an opportunity. * They Fell - Randy & Chad Feelings change in this friendship. * Where It Went - Phil & Marci A married couple waits for the other shoe to drop. * Story of Hope - Daniel & Hope Daniel lost hope. * Seeing the Thing - Dave & Rhonda Dave helps Rhonda see the most important thing. * Epilogue - Pete & Ginette Pete and Ginette can be close again. Aside from a few references in dialogue to characters in other scenes, the stories do not intertwine. Reviews and awards Almost, Maine opened Off-Broadway at the Daryl Roth Theatre on 12 January 2006 and closed on 12 February 2006. Directed by Gabriel Barre, the cast included Todd Cerveris, Justin Hagan, Miriam Shor, and Finnerty Steeves. Though its Off Broadway run was brief, the play is featured in Smith and Kraus' New Playwrights: Best Plays of 2006 and has proved popular in professional and nonprofessional theatre companies worldwide. In 2017-2018, it was the most produced play in North American high schools, supplanting Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. The New York Times review of the play in 2006 was mixed: ‚ÄúA comedy comprising almost a dozen two-character vignettes exploring the sudden thunderclap of love and the scorched earth that sometimes follows, John Cariani‚Äôs play will evoke either awww-s or ick-s, depending on your affection for its whimsical approach to the joys and perils of romance.‚Äù The New York Times review of another production at TheatreWorks in Hartford in 2013 was positive: ‚ÄúJohn Cariani‚Äôs Almost, Maine is a series of nine amiably absurdist vignettes about love, with a touch of good-natured magic realism ... This is a beautifully structured play, with nifty surprise endings (most but not all of them happy) and passing references to characters from other vignettes, which slyly tell us more about them. Mr. Cariani describes the play‚Äôs subject as ‚Äòfalling in and out of love‚Äô. It is just as much about pain.‚Äù * Selected by the American National Theatre as one of the most outstanding regional theatre productions of the 2004-2005 season. * Featured in New Playwrights: Best Plays of 2006. * Most produced play in North American high schools 2009‚Äì2010 and 2011‚Äì2012. Controversy In October 2014, Maiden High School in North Carolina canceled a production of Almost, Maine after \\"some parents and area churches complained about the play‚Äôs inclusion of a same-sex couple\\" according to students. Principal Rob Bliss released a statement describing the play as having \\"sexually-explicit overtones and multiple sexual innuendos that are not aligned with our mission and educational objectives.\\" John Cariani contacted a local news outlet about the controversy and was quoted as saying \\"I believe the play is about love, not sexual love. The scene with the two young men has no reference to sex at all.\\" Cariani added: \\"I just think there is a solution other than canceling the production. I‚Äôve reached out to the teacher who applied for rights to the play, but I haven‚Äôt heard back. I don‚Äôt think the students should have to suffer. They had already purchased the play and started rehearsing for it.\\" With the involvement of a local teacher, Carmen Eckard, the group performed the play off-campus in mid January, after raising over $6,000 on Kickstarter. The play was directed by local actor and attorney William Morgan.

The King of Spain during the period of the Protector of the Indians was King Charles V. The King of Spain throughout this era gained the information of the treatments through Bartolom√© de las Casas. Bartolom√© de las Casas was one of the first Europeans to set foot into the new hemisphere and he later dedicated his life to the desire of ending harsh treatment of Indians. Origins The first steps towards the implementation of protection policies for indigenous peoples is believed to have commenced in 1516, when several Hieronymites friars were sent to the Spanish possessions in the Caribbean to evaluate the consequences that colonization was having upon the demographic decline of the native population which began when the Indians were forced into slavery. The Indians faced other effects such as forced conversion. The report made by Fray Bartolome de las Casas to Cardinal Cisneros is probably the first documented attempt of those efforts, when the bishops took upon themselves the task of exercising protective actions on the native population. Bartolom√© de las Casas, The Devastation of the Indies: A Brief Account, trans. Herma Briffault (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), 32-35, 40-41. Cisneros granted the title of Protector de Indios to Bartolom√© de las Casas, and he was given instructions to serve as an adviser regarding issues concerning the native population. Bartolom√© de las Casas was also asked to speak on their behalf during legal proceedings, reporting back to Spain. For over fifty years, while traveling to and from the New World and the court of Spain, Bartolom√© de las Casas used his books, letters, and preaching to reveal the harshness of the conquests. Other notable protectors included Juan de Zum√°rraga (appointed 1527) and Hernando de Luque (appointed 1529). Legislation Zum√°rraga proposed in 1529 to appoint a trusted group of secular officials from different religious orders to be elected as such protectors and intervene in Indian civil and criminal cases. However, the Crown would not yield to the regular clergy full sovereignty over the indigenous population and in 1530 decreed that all issues regarding the natives were to be handled by government officers elected by the local Audiencia. The lack of legislation and official recognition produced many difficulties when trying to define the roles of the protector of the Indians, that were mostly exercised by the bishops during the early period. It wasn't until the publication of the New Laws in 1542 that there was an official prohibition of the enslavement of the natives with added provisions for the gradual abolition of the encomienda system. The first provisions directly addressing the Protector de Indios as such are first known to appear in the Cedulario Indiano compiled by Encina Diego in 1596, and later in the Compilation of the Laws of the Indies, Volume II, Book VI, Title V. Other related provisions within the Laws refer to the treatment of the Indian subjects, their evangelization and the good care of their lives, with specific instructions to not oppress them in any way and to regard them as vassals of the Crown. It also required from the prosecutor of the local Audiencia to watch over the treatment given to the natives by colonial representatives with the obligation to punish any violation of the law and notify the Council of the Indies. On April 9, 1591 the Crown issued a Royal Decree and a letter to Luis de Velasco, viceroy of New Spain, that laid down the legal basis for the creation of a specific agency dedicated to the defense of the natives in the colonies. The office was to be headed by an attorney general and a consultant to the legal procedures involving natives. Aftermath Following the repeal of the Spanish Constitution of 1812 the Protector√≠a de indios was dismantled, and although it was temporarily restored following the Trienio Liberal, it disappeared completely from the American colonies after their independence, leaving the indigenous population subject to a completely different legal status.

It is a branch of marine biology and botany.  Marine Plant Classifications  There are five kingdoms that present-day classifications group organisms into: the Monera, Protist, Plantae, Fungi, and Animalia.  The Monera  Less than 2,000 species of bacteria occur in the marine environment out of the 100,000 species. Although this group of species is small, they play a tremendous role in energy transfer, mineral cycles, and organic turnover. The monera differs from the four other kingdoms as \\"members of the Monera have a prokaryotic cytology in which the cells lack membrane-bound organelles such as chloroplasts, mitochondria, nuclei, and complex flagella.\\" The bacteria can be divided into two major subkingdoms: Eubacteria and Archaebacteria. = Eubacteria: = \\"Eubacteria include the only bacteria that contain chlorophyll a and are placed in the divisions Cyanobacteria or blue-green algae and Prochlorophyta (Chloroxybacteria).\\"  Kingdom Protist  The Protist kingdom contains species that have been categorized due to the simplicity of their structure and being unicellular. These include protozoa, algae and slime molds. In marine ecosystems, macroalgae and microalgae make up a large portion of the photosynthetic organisms found. The algae can be then further categorized based off these characteristics: * Storage Products * Photosynthetic Pigments * Chloroplast Structure * Inclusions of the cell * Cell wall structure * Flagella structure * Cell division * Life history The algae in the Protist kingdom can be placed into three different categories of macroalgae/seaweeds-- Phaeophyta, Rhodophyta or Chlorophyta. The microalgae in these marine environments can be categorized into four varieties--Pyrrhophyta, Chrysophyta, Euglenophyta or Cryptophyta. Examples of the types of organisms found in the Protist Kingdom are Red, green and brown algae.

He played over 100 matches in the Football League for Southport. Early life and career at Whitehaven Jimmy Cowen was born in Distington, near Cumbria. He was in the Workington Under-18s and attracted Whitehaven Athletic, who eventually brought him to the club where he trained for 2 years before leaving. Not much is known about his Whitehaven career. He left to join Nelson. Career in East Lancashire Cowen made his debut in the 4‚Äì1 loss to Plymouth, scoring a consolation goal for Nelson. He scored a brace in the 2‚Äì1 win against Northampton Town but fractured his ankle. He couldn't help Nelson escape the drop. After his ankle was fully healed, he started the game against Aldershot and scored in the 2‚Äì2 draw. After that, he slowly slipped into the reserve team and was sold to Barnoldswick Town. He made his debut for Barnoldswick in a game against Workington, scoring two in a 5-0 drubbing. He became a first team regular and reached a point where people knew he would become a prolific player. He scored a hattrick against Carlisle City. Barnoldswick won 4‚Äì2. He scored another hattrick against Aldershot in a 2‚Äì3 win. Northampton Town showed an interest in him and the transfer was finally accepted. His last game was against Nelson his old club, where he got the winning and only goal. Northampton Town and move to Southport Northampton needed to get something out of Cowen but he was injured in a 1‚Äì0 loss to Charlton Athletic suffering a broken leg. He couldn't make his full debut and could only play on the last day where Northampton needed a win against Preston Athletic. Cowen got the assist for the winning goal for Northampton in a 1‚Äì0 win. Meanwhile, Southport scouts had sought an interest in Cowen when he was at Barnoldswick. He was moved for free to Southport, where he reached the pinnacle of his career.

It focuses on making sure that information is complete, available and therefore usable. Activities involved with managing digital continuity include information management, information risk assessment and managing technical environments, including file format conversion. Digital continuity management is particularly important to organisations that have a duty to maintain accountability, and to act transparently and legally, such as government and infrastructure companies. Digital continuity is also an important issue for organisations responsible for maintaining repositories of information in digital form over time, such as archives and libraries. Focus of digital continuity The focus of digital continuity differs from that of digital preservation and business continuity. While there is some overlap among these areas, they should be treated as related but separate issues. Business continuity focuses on making sure that critical business functions will be available to customers, suppliers, regulators, and other entities that must have access to those functions. Digital preservation focuses on long term strategies and requirements for storing digital information in an effort to stabilize the collection of digital records. Digital continuity is concerned with the ability to make digital information continuously usable for as long as required. What constitutes usable will be different depending on each organization's needs. For the purposes of digital continuity, The National Archives believes digital information is usable when one can: *find it when needed *open it as needed *work with it in the way needed *understand what it is and what it is about *trust that it is what it says it is.  Digital continuity projects  The National Archives in the United Kingdom began a digital continuity project for public use in 2007. The project is based on a four-stage process for managing digital information effectively in organisations: *Step 1: Plan for action: All employees in the organization need to be aware of the digital continuity project and have an understanding of what digital continuity means for the information they create. This step also includes assessing existing work practices in order to ensure that people working within the system have the potential to deliver continuity. *Step 2: Define your digital continuity requirements: Ensure that an effective records management system is in place so that it is understood what information needs to be kept and how it will be used over time, regardless of change. *Step 3: Assess and manage risks to digital continuity: This step involves a digital continuity risk assessment which highlights areas of concern. This may include identifying file formats in current use which are susceptible to obsolescence. Identifying risks will help mitigate potential problems. *Step 4: Maintain digital continuity: This step ensures that your organization will be able to continue to use the digital information it produces in the future through changes in technology. This involves embedding the concept of digital continuity into existing business processes. At Archives New Zealand, the digital continuity project is entitled the Digital Continuity Action Plan. The Archives New Zealand project is focused on ensuring digital information is available in the future, that the information remains authentic and reliable, and that the public has continuous access through a proactive approach to maintaining digital information. The Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC), which concerns itself with digital preservation issues including digital continuity, has published reports advocating the assessment of digital preservation needs in the UK, and has been consulted in the creation of the Digital Continuity Action Plan at Archives New Zealand. The National Archives is also a member of the DPC. Other digital continuity projects are underway at the Welsh Assembly Government in conjunction with the University of Wales, Newport., and the National Library of Australia.

It is presented by Steve Backshall, with Naomi Wilkinson as co-host on Live 'n Deadly, and Barney Harwood as co-host on Natural Born Hunters. The strand began with a single series known as Deadly 60, and has subsequently expanded into a number of spin-offs, re-edits and follow-up versions. Deadly 60 Each series shows Backshall and his camera crew travelling the world in an attempt to find another 60 of the \\"most deadly\\" animals in the world. In each episode, Backshall tracks several animals in its habitat, and giving details of what makes the animal notable, with particular emphasis on its impact on the wider ecosystem and the manner of its predatory behaviour; thus, why it is \\"deadly\\". Deadly 60 is distributed by BBC Worldwide to many other countries. Most prominently to the US on NatGeo Wild from August 2011. Live 'n Deadly Live 'n Deadly is a spin-off series to Deadly 60, with 10 live shows and 3 non-live Specials. This series is a live magazine program hosted by Steve Backshall and Naomi Wilkinson, which features a range of magazine content, features and games relating to animals and wildlife, and also uses its live broadcast to encourage interactivity with the viewing audience. The program was a touring series, with episodes filmed live on location from areas around the UK. The first series of Live 'n Deadly aired on BBC Two (simulcast with CBBC Channel) on Saturday mornings at 9:00 am in between September and December 2010. In addition to the live Saturday show, a public roadshow event was also held the following day in the general area that the program had visited that week (though never in exactly the same location). These roadshows were run by BBC Learning and featured a number of hands-on wildlife-related activities for children and families, and footage from the roadshow events was broadcast the following Saturday as part of the following live programme.

It aired for the first time in 2012. Deadly Pole to Pole In the series, which premiered in October, 2013, Steve Backshall travels pole to pole through the Americas while looking for dangerous animals. Backshall's Deadly Adventures A series where Steve Backshall goes on deadly adventures. Natural Born Hunters A series in which Bob Brisbane narrate various clips (mostly from Deadly 60) about predators and how they hunt. This series could be considered a combination of the 'Deadly' series and the series Deadly 60 Games Several Deadly 60 Flash games have also been produced for CBBC. Deadly Dash (released September 2010) was one of the most popular games on the channel that year. Deadly Planet & Deadly Scramble were subsequently released in September 2012 to coincide with series 2 of Live 'n' Deadly. Deadly Dinosaurs In 2018, it was announced that Backshall would be doing a new \\"Deadly\\" series, this time about Dinosaurs. The series started in June 2018 and had 10 Episodes, broadcast every Wednesday. Each dinosaur is shown as a computer generated figure (mostly using footage from Planet Dinosaur), supposedly the most realistic version yet. Each dinosaur is then given a deadly scale, based on Weapons, Size and Speed. Though the only thing to get 100% Deadly was the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs off in the 9th episode dubbed \\"Deadlier Than the Dinosaurs\\".

Influenced largely by electronic music, post-punk, and modern classical music, they refer to themselves \\"electronic balladeers\\". Formed in 2004, the band were initially signed by Los Angeles label Trakwerx in 2007, founded by Jackson Del Rey of Californian post-punk band Savage Republic and 17 Pygmies. Now on their own \\"CWNN Music\\" label, they are distributed worldwide through Darla Records, home of Harold Budd, and My Morning Jacket. They are published through Blow Up Songs, founded by Paul Tunkin of the well known britpop Blow Up (club night).  Career   2004-2012  Having contributed three instrumental tracks to 17 Pygmies' comeback album 13 Blackbirds, Cult With No Name made their full debut with the album Paper Wraps Rock in 2007. The album was met with broadly positive reviews, although the band regard it as their weakest, with the renowned music journalist Mick Mercer in particular championing the band, and making them his 'discovery of 2007'. The band's second album, Careful What You Wish For, was released a year later and included the instrumental track \\"You Know Me Better Than I Know Myself\\", which featured Tuxedomoon's Blaine L. Reininger on violin, and a piano-based cover of The Stranglers' classic \\"Golden Brown\\". The album was met with positive reviews, with supporters that include the filmmaker Don Letts. Former Suede frontman, Brett Anderson, also invited Cult With No Name to open for him at the launch of his solo album Slow Attack. The band's next project was to record a new score for the classic German expressionist silent film, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, which was released simultaneously as a DVD and digital download in 2009 and coincided with the 90th anniversary of the making of the film. The score was notable for the inclusion of songs alongside instrumental soundscapes. In late 2010, Cult With No Name released their fourth studio album, entitled Adrenalin, which expanded the band's sound to include elements of trip-hop and psychedelia. The album includes the disco-pastiche, \\"The All Dead Burlesque Show\\" and underground electronic hit \\"Breathing\\". The website dsoaudio.com hailed the album as a \\"serious contender for album of the year\\".  2012-present  Above as Below, Cult With No Name's fifth album, was released in January 2012. For the first time, it saw the band collaborate with a number of outside artists. Kelli Ali (ex-Sneaker Pimps) contributed extensively, including co-writing the song \\"Shake Hands with the Devil\\". Other contributors included Bruce Geduldig and Luc van Lieshout of Tuxedomoon, ex-Stranglers and Peter Gabriel guitarist John Ellis and Meg Maryatt of 17 Pygmies. The cover art and packaging for the album was designed by David Bowie and Damien Hirst collaborator Jonathan Barnbrook and manufactured using a letterpress. Mark Moore of S'Express described the album as possessing \\"such warmth, such style, such bliss\\". 2012 also saw CWNN contribute the opening track to a remix album from the German band S.Y.P.H., which features ex-Captain Beefheart guitarist Gary Lucas and Rambo Amadeus, amongst others. In early 2013, Kelli Ali released her fifth solo album Band of Angels, which saw the band co-write and perform on two songs including the track \\"Eternity\\". The band's sixth album, Another Landing, was released in April 2014 on the band's own CWNN Music label. The album again saw the band collaborate with Tuxedomoon members Blaine L. Reininger, Bruce Geduldig and Luc van Lieshout, Kelli Ali and John Ellis, as well as Japanese electronica artist Coppe', and features the track \\"Swept Away\\", which was subsequently remixed by Rusty Egan. 2014 also saw the band contribute a cover \\"Typist of Candy\\" by Nits, a significant influence on CWNN, for the album ISNT NITS. 2016 saw the band contribute to a cover of Tuxedomoon's 'Loneliness' to a Crammed Discs reissue of the band's classic 'Half-Mute' album, that also featured Foetus, Aksak Maboul, and Simon Fisher Turner. Working once more with Blaine L. Reininger, Luc Van Lieshout and Kelli Ali, they also covered S'Express's 'COMA' for their 'Enjoy This Trip' remix album, which also included tracks from Chris & Cosey, Tom Furse from The Horrors, Primal Scream, Billie Ray Martin and Reuben Wu from Ladytron. 'Heir of the Dog', the band's 8th album, was released in September 2017, featuring the usual guest appearances from Tuxedomoon and Kelli Ali. The album includes the song 'No News', which closes the film 'Blue Velvet Revisited' but was not included on the soundtrack. Roger Spy directed a memorable 'cut up' video for the song 'When I Was a Girl'. The album picked up very favourable reviews. A cover of The Residents's 'Boo Who?' appeared on the 2018 collaborative fan project 'I Am A Resident' through Cherry Red Records, and the band also contributed a cover of 'I Hate Heaven' to a tribute to the late Hardy Fox, which also featured The Residents, Renaldo and the Loaf, and Fred Frith. The band's 9th album 'Mediaburn' was released in October 2019 and was met with very positive reviews. More political than earlier albums, it includes a number of sardonic put-downs of contemporary society. The album is also notable for the track '(No Such Thing As) Silence' which was commissioned by the Olympus Corporation and composed using ambient sounds solely captured via an Olympus LS-P4 mobile audio recorder. Several reviews also paid special attention the album's packaging.  Blue Velvet Revisited  In early 2015, CWNN were commissioned by German filmmaker Peter Braatz to produce the soundtrack for Blue Velvet Revisited, a feature-length documentary film based around previously unreleased footage that Braatz had shot on the set of the David Lynch's classic film Blue Velvet, at the invitation of Lynch. The band invited Tuxedomoon to collaborate on the project, with John Foxx also contributing music. The resulting soundtrack was released in October 2015 and received significant international press and extremely positive reviews. The film premiered in October 2016 at the London Film Festival, with David Lynch selecting the film to be screened at his own Festival of Disruption in Los Angeles on the same weekend as the premiere. Since then, the film has been screened at a large number of festivals and cinemas worldwide. In May 2019, The Criterion Collection re-released Blue Velvet on DVD and Blu-Ray with Blue Velvet Revisited included as a main extra at Lynch's request. In 2020, the track \\"Lumberton\\" from the soundtrack of Blue Velvet Revisited, was licensed to be used in the HBO series The New Pope, starring Jude Law and John Malkovich.  Other work  In addition to their studio albums, the band have contributed music to two comedic stage productions at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, Moz and the Meal and Bored Stiff, and provide all the music for the popular true crime 'Murder Mile' podcast from the same writer, Michael Buchanan-Dunne. The band have frequently collaborated with minimal techno artist Doudou Malicious for his Multi- Vitamins label. Erik Stein has also acted in several short films made by electronic music pioneer John Foxx as well as the 2011 short film Sonus produced by Ridley Scott Associates and Gustav (2012), which was on display at Bletchley Park. In 2016, Erik Stein contributed lead vocals on two tracks for Blitz Club founder and DJ Rusty Egan's solo album 'Welcome to the Dancefloor', which additionally features Peter Hook (New Order), Midge Ure (Ultravox!) and Tony Hadley (Spandau Ballet). He also sings lead vocals on a subsequent Rusty Egan single 'I Thought I Could Never Love Again' with guests Chris Payne (musician) (ex-Gary Numan) and saxophonist Gary Barnacle. CWNN's music has been described as difficult to categorise. However, they been compared to Roxy Music, Tuxedomoon, the Pet Shop Boys, Colin Newman, Nits, David Sylvian, and Scott Walker, amongst others. As well as performing in the UK, the band has performed in the US and Europe. The band were nominated for the UK's Exposure Music Awards in 2011.

Numerous independent studies of the device found it to be no more effective than the placebo effect for enhancing athletic performance, and the manufacturer was forced by the ACCC to retract any previous claims in 2010. The product was originally promoted at trade shows in the beginning of 2006 utilizing applied kinesiology as its most effective sales tool. They then began selling the product in 2007 and had amassed countless celebrity endorsements many free and some paid they had become a trend among high school, collegiate and professional sports in 2008-2012 although bands are regularly sighted on athletes today, those 5 years were the biggest boom for Power Balance. Leading one journalist to say that \\"a growing number of professional sportsmen and their attendants are starting to sound like New Age crystal healers.\\"Power Balance bracelets: source of energy or just a gimmick?, Daily Telegraph, 15 October 2010 Another journalist gave Power Balance the CNBC Sports Product of the Year in 2010. Power Balance Headquarters which was located in Laguna Niguel, California at the time, denied that they made any medical or scientific claims about their products, but after an Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ruling, the Australian distributor of Power Balance was forced to recognize and retract any possible claims. The company had been the focus of significant criticism, particularly for false advertising. It has been described as \\"like the tooth fairy\\"\\"Wristy business\\", High Desert Daily Press, December 16, 2010 and a \\"very successful marketing scam\\".'Power' wristbands might be the biggest scam , The Age, June 20, 2010 Although Dylan Evans, a lecturer in behavioral science at Cork University's School of Medicine and author of Placebo stated \\"I was really impressed by the marketing. They have managed to get away without deceiving anyone in the sense of an overt lie. There are no claims on the packaging itself. They don't make any reference at all to any health outcomes. They leave that as an inference that most people will draw.\\" By the end of 2011 the company was reported to be on the edge of going out of business after allegedly having to settle a $57m lawsuit, in the course of which company executives acknowledged that their past claims to improve strength and balance were not backed by science. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy due to a multitude of lawsuits, but the brand has since been transferred to a new company, Power Balance Technologies and is still selling Power Balance bands and other items today. Efficacy IIG testing Power Balance in progress, Oct 28, 2010 In 2011, researchers from RMIT's School of Health Sciences reported the results of an independent, randomized and controlled trial with double blind design. They found no difference in balance between people using a holographic wristband and those wearing a placebo. On October 28, 2010 Olympic champion gymnast Dominique Dawes, working for Yahoo Weekend News and Independent Investigations Group (IIG), tested Power Balance bracelets for their claim that they improve balance, flexibility and strength. According to IIG investigator Dave Richards \\"There was one 'legitimate' Power Balance bracelet, and 3 'sham' bracelets that had the hologram removed from them. The experiment was double-blinded, all bracelets were wrapped with tape so no one present knew which bracelet was real and which were fakes. Neither the participants nor the people recording the scores knew which bracelet was 'real' until after all participants had completed their runs and their scores were recorded.\\" The results indicated that there was no benefit for those that had a real holographic bracelet compared to those who had a placebo. In December 2009, an informal double-blind test was performed on the Australian television program Today Tonight, led by Richard Saunders from the Australian Skeptics. The results showed strong evidence that any effect of the holograms is too small to measure against the placebo effect. A study at the University of Wisconsin tested the effects of Power Balance bracelets on a group of NCAA athletes. One set of the athletes received the Power Balance bracelet, while the other received a placebo bracelet. The athletes were subjected to tests of flexibility, balance, and strength, after which, the athletes switched bracelets and performed the tests again. The study found that the Power Balance bracelet had no effect, compared to the placebo, on the performance of the athletes. A group of students skeptical of the claims conducted a test which showed \\"no significant difference between the real wristband and the fake\\".Students test claims of hologram wristband, Orange County register, Dec. 14, 2010 Researchers commissioned by the BBC also found that the bands were placebos,Power Balance band is placebo, say expert, BBC News, 22 November 2010 A 2012 Skeptical Inquirer study showed that in a double-blind test of performance on an obstacle course, sixteen volunteers showed a difference in performance no greater than chance. Criticisms Former US president Bill Clinton was reported to wear a Power Balance Power Band. Many experts are of the opinion that the Power Balance bracelet is nothing more than a placebo. Victor Thompson, a sports psychologist based in London, is quoted saying: \\"I'm not aware of any research that supports the technology behind these bands\\". Greg Whyte, professor of applied sport and exercise science, Liverpool John Moores University observed that \\"For generations there have been devices that claim to mediate the body's flow of energy, from acupuncture to copper wristbands and, latterly, magnets ... In most instances, the 'proof' is based on anecdotal evidence.\\"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/power- suggestion-celebs-jump-band-1904677 The Center for Inquiry noted Power Balance's use of pseudoscientific applied kinesiology tests, which it described as \\"problematic and full of flaws\\". The illustrative videos on the company's website were considered vague and unclear, and the Center noted that \\"most people's flexibility seems to improve from their first stretch to their second stretch regardless of whether they are wearing the bracelet\\". In the Skeptical Inquirer in 2010, Harriet A. Hall wrote that she would believe anyone who claimed that a Power Balance product made them feel better, or that their performance was improved, but would not be convinced that \\"the improvement has anything to do with bioresonating frequencies in the holograms‚Äîor even with the cards themselves. It's like the tooth fairy. Tell me money appears under your pillow, and I will believe you. But that won't convince me that the tooth fairy did it.\\" Australian consumer advocate group CHOICE recognized Power Balance in their 2010 \\"Shonky Awards\\". The Shonky Awards are intended to \\"name and shame the shonkiest rip-offs and scams.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald concluded the Power Balance bracelets ‚Äúdid little else than empty purchasers‚Äô wallets‚Äù. In November 2012, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban criticized an endorsement deal between the NBA and Power Balance. When a similar product was pitched on the ABC reality series Shark Tank, which features Cuban as one of the \\"sharks\\", he dismissed the product, stating \\"No, I'm allergic to scams. Seriously, this is not new. It's been disproven. What you saw is the placebo effect. There's athletes that wear it. It's a joke. It's a scam. It's not real.\\" A study by Verdan et al. (2012) examined the effects of the Power Balance band on static balance, hamstring flexibility, and arm strength in adults. The study involved 10 male and 14 female subjects. A counterbalance, double-blind, placebo, controlled within-subject design was used. Each of the subjects participated in 3 treatment sessions, consisting of Power Balance, placebo band, and no band. This study found that there were no statistically significant differences in strength, flexibility, or balance with regard to the treatments used. Therefore, these results suggest that the Power Balance bands did not have an effect on strength, flexibility, or balance. This study is important in disproving the claims made by Power Balance since it controls for the placebo effect and indicates that any perceived benefit from using the Power Balance is due to the placebo effect. Legal issues In November 2010, the Australian distributors of \\"Power Balance\\" were ordered by the Therapeutic Goods Administration Complaints Resolution Panel to drop \\"false and misleading\\" claims that the wearers would experience \\"up to a 500% increase in strength, power and flexibility\\", and ordered the claims removed from the company's website and a retraction posted within two weeks.Slap on the wrist for power balance, Sydney Morning Herald, November 21, 2010 The Junta de Andalucia fined the Marbella-based subsidiary a sum of ‚Ç¨15,000 for false advertising; consumer organization Facua are appealing to the Health Department for an increased fine as they consider this insufficient.‚ÄòMiracle‚Äô bracelet company fined ‚Ç¨15k , Euro Weekly News, 26 November 2010 Also in November 2010 Power Balance filed suit against Microsoft for infringement of trade dress in respect of the Xbox Kinect, after the company announced a range of promotional wristbands.Microsoft Kinect launch could be scuppered by Power Balance law suit , Tech Eye, 2 November 2010Power Balance Sues Microsoft for Trade Dress Infringement, Washington University College of Law Intellectual Property Brief, 16 November 2010 In December 2010, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) obtained from Power Balance Australia Pty.

ACCC chairman Graeme Samuel stated \\"It's a crock frankly. And we're very disappointed that so many people have paid hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars to buy these Power Bands.\\" Power Balance Australia was required by the ACCC to run a series of advertisements in Australian media containing the following text and to unconditionally refund those they mislead:Power Balance come clean and offer refunds after admitting wristbands do not enhance performance, Daily Telegraph, 4 Jan, 2011 : \\"In our advertising we stated that Power Balance wristbands improved your strength, balance and flexibility.

In September 2010, the Dutch Advertising Code Commission (RCC) made the following decision in the case where FIR-TEX Ltd, the plaintiff, had put Surf Unlimited Trading BV, distributor of power-balance in the Netherlands, on trial with the following complaint: : \\"Advertiser claims on its website that the use of the Power Balance Bracelet improves balance, strength and agility. These allegations are not backed with any single (scientific) evidence. The plaintiff believes that this method of advertising is in conflict with the Dutch Advertising Code (NRC) as the link between wearing the bracelet and the health of the wearer has not been determined in any way.\\" The verdict of the commission was as follows: : The Commission considers the advertisement in opposition of the provisions of Article 7 NRC. It recommends advertiser not to advertise in such a way anymore. In January 2011, a suit was filed in the United States against the company for fraud, false advertising, unfair competition and unjust enrichment. Power Balance agreed in September 2011 to settle the class action lawsuit. The settlement terms entitled Power Balance purchasers to a full $30 refund plus $5 shipping. A hearing to finalize the agreement was canceled after Power Balance filed for Chapter 11 protection. In November 2011, Power Balance filed for bankruptcy after suffering a net loss of more than $9 million that year. In 2012 the company announced it was trading under new ownership as Power Balance Technologies Inc.

Emerging from an earlier piece he wrote for BBC Radio, the work is an anecdotal reminiscence of a Christmas from the viewpoint of a young boy, portraying a nostalgic and simpler time. It is one of Thomas's most popular works. As with his poetry, A Child's Christmas in Wales does not have a tight narrative structure but instead uses descriptive passages in a fictionalised autobiographical style, designed to create an emotive sense of the nostalgia Thomas is intending to evoke, remembering a Christmas from the viewpoint of the author as a young boy. Thomas searches for a nostalgic belief in Christmases past\\"It was snowing. It was always snowing at Christmas\\"furthering his idyllic memory of childhood by describing the snow as being better and more exciting than the snow experienced as an adult. The dissertation, with exaggerated characters for comedic effect, show how childhood memories are enlarged through youthful interpretation. Publishing history Thomas had recorded work for the BBC since 1937, when he read poetry on air and talked about being a poet.Ferris (1989), p. 154 His radio work provided a minor source of income; in the early 1940s he began writing radio scripts and in late 1942 he wrote a 15-minute talk that was broadcast by the Welsh BBC in February 1943 titled Reminiscences of Childhood.Ferris (1989), p. 213 This was followed by Quite Early one Morning in 1944, recorded in Wales and produced by Aneirin Talfan Davies. After being well received in Wales, Davies offered the recording of Quite Early one Morning to the BBC in London for national broadcast but the producers at the BBC were unimpressed by what was described as Thomas' \\"breathless poetic voice\\" and it was rejected. In 1945, the producer of the Welsh Children's Hour, Lorraine Davies, wrote to Thomas suggesting a talk entitled \\"Memories of Christmas\\". Thomas thought that this was \\"a perfectly good title to hang something on\\", and by the autumn he had finished work on a reading for the show. It was accepted by BBC in London, but Derek McCulloch (Uncle Mac), the presenter and producer of Children's Hour, was unhappy about allowing the \\"notoriously tricky\\" Thomas to read the piece live, which was the normal practice of the show. In a letter to Thomas, McCulloch wrote there were technical reasons that prevented their recording it live on that day. Thomas recorded the work in advance. Almost five years later, Thomas enlarged his 1945 BBC talk \\"Memories of Christmas\\", merging in sections of an essay written for Picture Post in 1947 titled \\"Conversation about Christmas\\".Ferris (1989) p. 271 In 1950, he sold the work to Harper's Bazaar for $300 who published it under the title \\"A Child's Memories of a Christmas in Wales\\".Ferris (1989) pp. 213‚Äì214 On his 1952 tour of America, Thomas was visited at the Chelsea Hotel by college graduates Barbara Holdridge and Marianne Roney, who believed that there were commercial possibilities in the United States for recordings of poetry.Ferris (1980) p. 300 After previously finding little interest from American backers in medieval music and Shakespeare recitals, the women had turned to the recording of contemporary authors reading their own works. Thomas agreed to making a 45-minute LP record and an initial fee of $500 for the first 1,000 records sold and a 10% royalty thereafter. Holdridge and Mantell were unable to find an interested publishing company. They were forced to pay Thomas the initial fee, and a contract for that purpose was drawn up between Thomas and Caedmon Records, the women's company.Ferris (1980) p. 301 On 22 February 1952, Thomas recorded five of his poems: \\"In the white giant's thigh\\", \\"Fern Hill\\", \\"Do not go gentle into that good night\\", \\"Ballad of the Long-legged Bait\\", and \\"Ceremony After a Fire Raid\\". When they asked him what he would use to fill up the LP's B-side, rather than more poetry, Thomas preferred a story. He could not remember its actual title and said that he wanted to read, as he phrased it, \\"A Child's Christmas in Wales\\". On the day of recording, Thomas arrived at the studio without a copy of his story. A copy of Harper's Bazaar from 1950 containing the text had to be found for his reading.https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=866406 Roney later stated that she believed Thomas may have been drunk during the recording. It sold modestly at first, going on to become one of his most loved works and launching Caedmon into being a successful company.Ferris (1989) p. 214 One year after making this recording, Thomas died in New York aged 39. In 1954, the story was first published in book format as part of the American pressing of \\"Quite early one morning\\" and published the following year under its own title, A Child's Christmas in Wales. Thomas' original 1952 recording of A Child's Christmas in Wales was a 2008 selection for the United States National Recording Registry, stating that it is \\"credited with launching the audiobook industry in the United States\\". Illustrations The prose readily lends itself to being illustrated, and the original 1959 pressing by Caedmon Records' New Directions contained five wood-block engravings by Fritz Eichenberg. In subsequent editions, the 1968 Dent pressing featured woodcuts by Ellen Raskin; the 1978 publication by Orion Children's was illustrated by Edward Ardizzone; followed by a 1985 version by Holiday House with images by Trina Schart Hyman. Adaptation A Child's Christmas in Wales has been adapted for the theatre, for film and television, and animation. * Welsh musician John Cale wrote and recorded a song, \\"Child's Christmas in Wales\\", on his album Paris 1919 (1973).

His art, diet, and lifestyle are heavily influenced by Eastern culture and thought, and for years, Kehl cut his hair in the Wu D'an kung fu style with an added twist of dreadlocks. These dreads were cut and burned in the latter part of 2010 in India where he was filming \\"The Zanskar Odyssey: High Alpine Bouldering in the Hidden Himalayas\\". On Cryptochild.com, Kehl's website, he writes, \\"Climbing always interested me because it is a great way to express yourself using your body, sometimes aggressive like a brutal fight and sometimes slow and seductive like a ritualistic dance. In that way I see climbing as a good artistic outlet.\\" In 2008, Kehl underwent ACL replacement surgery and was sidelined for the better half of a year. During this time, Kehl focused more heavily on his website, blog, and other artistic pursuits. Kehl is interested in graphic design, special effects, videography, animation, and collecting doll heads.
