Khalid bin Sinan Al-Absi is a judge and writer of Arab writers and their sages, and he was passionate about the religion of Abraham, calling for the renunciation of idols, wine and usury. Historical accounts narrate that he was one of a line of prophets sent to the Arab peoples, beginning with Ismā'īl and ending with Muhammad.  Ancestry  His ancestry is linked to the clan of Banu 'Abs, descendants of ʿAbs ibn Baghīd ibn Rayth ibn Ghaṭafān, to the tribe of Ghatafan: \\"Khalid bin Sinan bin Ghaith bin Maritah bin Makhzum bin Rabi'ah bin Aus bin Malik bin Ghalib bin Qutay'ah bin 'Abs bin Baghid bin Rayth bin Ghatafan\\" خالد بن سنان بن غيث بن مريطة بن مخزوم بن ربيعة بن عوذ بن مالك بن غالب بن قطيعة بن عبس بن بغيض بن ريث بن غطفان The Banu 'Abs are distant cousins of Muhammad, the final prophet of Islam, due to his direct descendant from the Arab ancestor Adnan, who were a group of Ishmaelite Arabs.  Biography  Khaled was born in Al-Yamama 50 years before the Year of the Elephant, and learned to read and write at an early age, and he started calling on his people to unite and renounce idols, discard alcohol, usury, and the facilitator, so he took up the judiciary in Bani Abs, as he was a prominent Arab writer before the year of the elephant, and he used to go to literary clubs and markets In Yamama and the Hijaz.  Sayings between some writers and historians  Some historians and narrators claimed that he was a prophet, and that the Prophet Muhammad said: “That is a prophet who was lost by his people.” however, it is a weak hadith - from a weak source. In Majma al-Zawa'id, the scholar Nur al-Din Al-Haythami said, this (prior) hadith is against the authentic hadith which also is reported by Abu Hurairah in Sahih al-Bukhari: \\"the Messenger of Allah (SWS) said: \\"I am most akin (closest) to 'Isa ibn Maryam (Jesus, son of Mary), among the whole of mankind, and all the Prophets are of different mothers but belong to one religion and no Prophet was raised between me and Jesus.\\" Ibn Kathir said, \\"And He is more like that he was good, righteous man for circumstances and dignities.\\"  Miscellaneous  He should not be confused with the companion of Muhammad of the same name, \\"Khalid ibn Sinan al-Awsi\\", who fought in the Battle of Badr. The name \\"Khaled\\" also appears in the supplication of Ummi Dawud by Ja'far al-Sadiq, the 6th Imam of Shia Islam, among a list of persons with whom the supplicant asks (God) to be blessed; most of whom appear in the Quran as prophets. It is believed that this is in reference to Khaled bin Sinan. See also * Prophets in Islam References * Khaled the prophet, Farhad Ghorban Dordinejad. A brief biography. * Regarding Khalid ibn Sinan.

On 22 March 1890, the order was cancelled as national order by the interim government of United States of Brazil. Since the deposition in 1889 of the last Brazilian monarch, Emperor Pedro II, the order continues as a house order being awarded by the Heads of the House of Orleans-Braganza, pretenders to the defunct throne of Brazil. The current Brazilian Imperial Family is split into two branches Petrópolis and Vassouras, and as a consequence the Grand Mastership of the Order is disputed between those two branches. History It was designed by Jean-Baptiste Debret, who, as discussed by historians, would have been inspired by the motifs of roses that adorned Amélie's dress when landing in Rio de Janeiro, or when marrying, or in a portrait of the same envoy from Europe to the then Emperor of Brazil. The order rewarded military and civilians, national and foreign, who distinguished themselves by their fidelity to the person of the Emperor and by services rendered to the State, and carried a number of degrees superior to the other Brazilian and Portuguese orders then existing. From 1829 to 1831 Emperor Pedro I granted only 189 insignia. His son and successor, Emperor Pedro II, during the second reign, got to grace 14,284 citizens. In addition to the two emperors, only the Duke of Caxias was order-great during his term. One of the first winners received the commendation for services rendered during an accident with the Brazilian imperial family: the small history of the court tells us that on 7 December 1829, newly married, Pedro I returned with the family of the Imperial Palace of São Cristóvão, in Quinta da Boa Vista. Like his favorite, he personally drove the carriage when, on Lavradio Street, the tow line was broken, and the horses became frightened, breaking the reins and driving the vehicle, dragged dangerously. The Emperor fractured the seventh rib of the posterior third and the sixth of the anterior third, had bruises on the forehead and dislocation in the fourth right, losing his senses. He had barely recovered them when he was picked up at the nearest house by the Marquis de Cantagalo, Joao Maria da Gama Freitas Berquó. According to the Bulletin on the Disaster of Her Imperial Majesty published in the Jornal do Commercio, Empress Amélie was the one who demanded the least care: \\"she did not have any sensible damage except the shock and the fright that such disaster should cause her.\\" The Emperor's eldest daughter, the future Queen Maria II of Portugal, \\"received great bruising on the right cheek, comprising part of the head on the same side.\\" Auguste de Beauharnais, Prince of Eichstätt, Duke of Leuchtenberg and of Santa Cruz, brother of the empress, \\"had a luxation in the ulna of the right side with fracture of the same one\\". Baroness Slorefeder, assistant of the Empress, \\"gave a very dangerous fall on the head.\\" Several servants of livery, when dominating the animals, were bruised. The doctors of the Imperial Chamber and others, the doctors Azeredo, Bontempo, the Baron of Inhomirim, Vicente Navarro de Andrade, João Fernandes Tavares, Manuel Bernardes, Manuel da Silveira Rodrigues de Sá, Baron of Saúde converged for the house of Cantagalo. Almost restored, Pedro I decorated Cantagalo on 1 January 1830 with the insignia of the dignitary of the Order, and Empress Amélie offered him her portrait, surrounded by bright jewels, and painted by Simplício Rodrigues de Sá. The members of the Honor Guard who accompanied the then Prince Regent on his trip to the Province of São Paulo 8 years before, witnesses of the \\"Grito do Ipiranga\\", landmark of the Independence of Brazil, were also awarded the Imperial Order of the Rose. After the banishment of the Brazilian Imperial Family, the order was maintained by its members in private, being its grand master the head of the Brazilian Imperial House.

Types=Sexually transmitted infections= Sexually transmitted disease that affect the vagina include: *Herpes genitalis. The herpes simplex virus (HSV) can infect the vulva, vagina, and cervix, and this may result in small, painful, recurring blisters and ulcers. It is also common for there to be an absence of any noticeable symptoms. *Gonorrhea *Chlamydia *Trichomoniasis *Human papillomavirus (HPV), which may cause genital warts. Because of STIs, health authorities and other health outlets recommend safe sex practices when engaging in sexual activity. =Other infectious diseases= * Candidal vulvovaginitis *Bacterial vaginosis (BV) associated with the Gardnerella, formerly called \\"nonspecific vaginitis\\" =Weekly overgrowth infection= Weekly overgrowth infection is a phenomenon that occurs after failure to remove the excess skin surrounding the clitoris, or pudendum enlargement. The growth can range from 1-6 inches. Growth may slow down or speed up depending on hormone levels, sexual activity, climate, and genetics. Growth typically begins at the start of puberty, and may slow or stop with menopause. Options to slow or remove growth to prevent infection include permanent removal surgery or hormone blockers. =Vaginismus= Vaginismus, which is not the same thing as vaginitis (an inflammation of the vagina), is an involuntary tightening of the vagina due to a conditioned reflex of the muscles in the area during vaginal penetration. It can affect any form of vaginal penetration, including sexual intercourse, insertion of tampons and menstrual cups, and the penetration involved in gynecological examinations. Various psychological and physical treatments are possible to help alleviate it. =Obstruction= A vaginal obstruction is often caused by an imperforate hymen or, less commonly, a transverse vaginal septum. A sign of vaginal obstruction is hydrocolpos, that is, accumulation of watery fluid within the vagina. It may extend to become hydrometrocolpos, that is, accumulation of watery fluid within the vagina as well as within the uterus.Farlex dictionary > hydrometrocolpos, citing: Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers. Copyright 2007 =Hypoplasia= Vaginal hypoplasia is the underdevelopment or incomplete development of the vagina. Vaginal hypoplasia can vary in severity from being smaller than normal to being completely absent. The absence of a vagina is a result of vaginal agenesis. Diagnostically, it may look similar to a vaginal obstruction. It is frequently associated with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küstner-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, in which the most common result is an absent uterus in conjunction with a deformed or missing vagina, despite the presence of normal ovaries and normal external genitalia. It is also associated with cervical agenesis, in which the uterus is present but the uterine cervix is absent. =Lumps= The presence of unusual lumps in the wall or base of the vagina is always abnormal. The most common of these is Bartholin's cyst. The cyst, which can feel like a pea, is formed by a blockage in glands which normally supply the opening of the vagina. This condition is easily treated with minor surgery or silver nitrate. Other less common causes of small lumps or vesicles are herpes simplex. They are usually multiple and very painful with a clear fluid leaving a crust. They may be associated with generalized swelling and are very tender. Lumps associated with cancer of the vaginal wall are very rare and the average age of onset is seventy years. The most common form is squamous cell carcinoma, then cancer of the glands or adenocarcinoma and finally, and even more rarely, vaginal melanoma. =Persistent genital arousal disorder= Persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD), which results in a spontaneous, persistent, and uncontrollable genital arousal, with or without orgasm, unrelated to any feelings of sexual desire. Because PGAD is relatively rare and, as its own concept apart from clitoral priapism (a rare, potentially painful medical condition in which, for an unusually extended period of time, the erect clitoris does not return to its relaxed state), has only been researched since 2001, there is little research into what may cure or remedy the disorder. In some recorded cases, PGAD was caused by, or caused, a pelvic arterial-venous malformation with arterial branches to the clitoris; surgical treatment was effective in these cases. =Other= *Vulvodynia *Vaginal prolapse may result in the case of weakened pelvic muscles, which is a common result of childbirth; in the case of this prolapse, the rectum, uterus, or bladder pushes on the vagina, and severe cases result in the vagina protruding out of the body. Kegel exercises have been used to strengthen the pelvic floor, and may help prevent or remedy vaginal prolapse. *Cervical cancer (may be prevented by Pap smear screening and HPV vaccines) *Vaginal cancer is very rare, but its symptoms include abnormal vaginal bleeding or vaginal discharge. *Air embolism is a potentially fatal condition where an air bubble travels throughout the bloodstream and can obstruct a vessel. It can result if air is blown into a pregnant woman's vagina during cunnilingus; this is because pregnant women have an increased vascularity of the vagina and uterus, and an air embolism can force air into the uterine veins. Symptoms=Discharge = Most vaginal discharges occur due to normal bodily functions, such as menstruation or sexual arousal (vaginal lubrication). Abnormal discharges, however, can indicate disease. Normal vaginal discharges include blood or menses (from the uterus), the most common, and clear fluid either as a result of sexual arousal or secretions from the cervix. Other non-infective causes include dermatitis. Non-sexually transmitted discharges occur from bacterial vaginosis, aerobic vaginitis and thrush or candidiasis. The final group of discharges include the sexually transmitted diseases gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis. The discharge from thrush is slightly pungent and white, that from trichomoniasis more foul and greenish, and that from foreign bodies resembling the discharge of gonorrhea, greyish or yellow and purulent (pus- like). =Sores= All sores involve a breakdown in the walls of the fine membrane of the vaginal wall. The most common of these are abrasions and small ulcers caused by trauma. While these can be inflicted during rape most are actually caused by excessive rubbing from clothing or improper insertion of a sanitary tampon. The typical ulcer or sore caused by syphilis is painless with raised edges. These are often undetected because they occur mostly inside the vagina. The sores of herpes which occur with vesicles are extremely tender and may cause such swelling that passing urine is difficult. In the developing world, a group of parasitic diseases also cause vaginal ulceration, such as leishmaniasis, but these are rarely encountered in the west. All of the aforementioned local vulvovaginal diseases are easily treated. Often, only shame prevents patients from presenting for treatment. =Inflammation= Vaginitis an inflammation of the vagina, such as caused by infection, hormone disturbance and irritation/allergy.

It has offered a broad range of entertainment including dramas, comedy and especially musicals since the 1990s. The theatre has been closed since March 2016, but is scheduled to reopen in August 2021, under parent company Trafalgar Entertainment, and will also house the school of performing arts \\"Stagecoach\\" and have a live-streaming hub. The reopening comes as a need for Sydney to accommodate a larger capacity venue, since the harbour city does not host as many larger venues as its counterpart Melbourne, which acquired the rights to the JK Rowling West End production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child History The name Theatre Royal had originally been used for a theatre upon which building work commenced in 1827 behind the Royal Hotel by Barnett Levey. This new playhouse was opened on 5 October 1833. It was closed in March 1838 and a few days later the Royal Victoria Theatre, a much larger building, was opened, with an entrance on Pitt Street, by Joseph Wyatt. Barnett Levey's Theatre Royal was burned to the ground in 1840 with the Victoria, which abutted on the rear, having a narrow escape from suffering the same fate. However, it was still destined to be consumed by fire – on 22 July 1880 it was totally destroyed.Sydney Harbour Bridge Official Souvenir Book Sydney, 1932, p.123-4. In 1875, the present Theatre Royal was founded, built for producer and manager Samuel Lazar in Castlereagh Street on the corner of Rowe Street, opposite the famous Australia Hotel. The theatre was leased by J C Williamson's from 1882 until 1978. The interior of this theatre was substantially remodelled in 1921 by architect Henry Eli White. In 1971–72 the theatre, along with the Hotel Australia, and much of the block on which it was situated, was demolished to construct the MLC Centre. Public agitation and action by construction unions once it was closed to save it resulted in the developer Lendlease incorporating a replacement 1,180-seat theatre into the design. Designed by Harry Seidler, along with the rest of the complex, the current Theatre Royal opened in 1976, with entry from King Street, between Pitt Street and Castlereagh Street. Designed in a plain modernist style. The theatre closed in March 2016 amid development of the MLC Centre and calls for a new larger Lyric Theatre to be built. In March 2019, the NSW Government announced it had taken on a 55-year lease of the theatre from the MLC Centre developers, with the intention to re-open the venue with a private operator. It was announced that the theatre will reopen in August 2021, after it was acquired by Trafalgar Entertainment, the company by British theatre impresario's Sir Howard Panter and Dame Rosemary Squire Productions The theatre is renowned for hosting a collective mix of entertainment from dramas, comedies and musicals, with notable localised production of such productions as The King and I, The Rocky Horror Picture Show and War Horse.

They are often termed big-eared bats or long-eared bats, as the length of their ears often greatly exceeds that of the head. This genus occurs in the New Guinean- Australian region.  Taxonomy  The first description of the genus was published in 1821 by William Elford Leach. The name Nyctophilus means night- loving and is derived from the combination of Ancient Greek nyktos and philos. The type species of the genus is Nyctophilus geoffroyi, the lesser long-eared bat. A monograph on the genus, published by Robert Fisher Tomes in 1858, cited two earlier descriptions, the species assumed by Tomes as the type for Nyctophilus geoffroyi, Leach, and incorporated the similar Vespertilio timoriensis Geoffroy as a new generic combination. Two new species were also named, Nyctophilus gouldi and Nyctophilus unicolor, both based on specimens supplied by John Gould. The availability of the name Nyctophilus timoriensis is uncertain and recognised or excluded in some treatments, following a revision and new taxa published in 2009. This followed the 2008 publication of unknown taxa noted as Nyctophilus sp., subspecies of T. timoriensis or new and separate species. An arrangement within the family Vespertilionidae, the common evening bats, separates the genus to the subfamilial taxon Vespertilioninae and the tribe Nyctophilini, allied to the monotypic genus of Pharotis imogene, a species also found in New Guinea. A taxon proposed in 1968, Lamingtona McKean & Calaby, is a synonym for the genus. An attempt to reclassify the group as Barbastellus Gray, 1829, which the author John Edward Gray later revised to include a type in 1831, is also synonymous with Nyctophilus Leach, 1821. The relationships between the species were first outlined in 1941, an arrangement that identified four interspecific groups. One of these alliances was the problematic timoriensis group, including the dubiously named N. timoriensis with N. major, N. sherrini and N. gouldi. Three other groups were named although with slight descriptions: bifax group (bifax and daedalus); geoffroyi group (with australis, pacificus, unicolor and pallescens); and microtis group (microtis, bicolor and walkeri). Description  A genus of the common and widely dispersed bat family Vespertilionidae, the common, evening bats. They are found in Australia, New Guinea and Indonesia, and lack extensive research into their diverse forms and habits. The species have a body arrangement that resembles the horseshoe bat family Rhinolophidae, but distinguished by ears that exceed the length of the head. The upper half of the ear is markedly ribbed at the inner surface. The muzzle of these species is short and tail features are typical of the family. The species have small appendages at the nostrils, similar to the larger ornamented structures of bats using nasally emitted constant frequency sound in echolocation. The often plain faced vespertilionid genera use frequency modulated echolocation, emitted orally, but this genus—and possibly the north american genus Antrozous—is confirmed to use sound via the nostril apparatus. The species may present twin births, unlike the single births of most microbat genera.  Diversity  Taxa within this genus, sometimes described as 'long-eared bats', are: *Greater long-eared bat, Nyctophilus timoriensis. A number of similar populations, tentatively distinguished or formally described, are referred to as the \\"Nyctophilus timoriensis complex\\", a group allied by similarity to this species and later typifications. Doubt regarding the type location, the epithet and author of Vespertilio timoriensis indicating the origin as Timor, was noted since early revisions of the genus. However, this nomenclaturally uncertain taxon is provisionally excluded at the Australian Faunal Directory, which instead recognises new taxa that emerged from comparative study of molecular and morphological research (Parnaby, 2009). * Northern species Nyctophilus arnhemensis Johnson, 1959. * Eastern sp.

A microbat found in semi-arid regions of Western Australia, from the Goldfields district to the Eyre Peninsula. The flight is a agile fluttering patrol, as with others of the complex, but is also noted as surveying from a perch and taking prey at the ground. They favour grasslands, such as spinifex, and wood or shrublands and mallee habitat. They reside in foliage, hollows, and under bark. They have been observed at the Nullarbor National Park in South Australia, and Western Australian nature reserves Nuytsland and Dundas. References *D.E. Wilson & D.M.

His activities were instrumental in determining fishery rights in the waters of Ulleungdo and the Liancourt Rocks, two islands in the Sea of Japan.  Background = Joseon, Korea = In the beginning of Joseon dynasty, a major policy to manage the two islands in East Sea, Ulleungdo (울릉도) and Dokdo (독도), was to repatriate the local residents back to the main land. The repatriation policy (쇄환 정책), in context of Joseon, was a policy to resettle islanders to main land for the sake of islander's safety and national security.[金晧東 (2005). 조선 초기 울릉도ㆍ독도에 대한 ‘空島政策’ 재검토. 민족문화논총, 32, 257-290] It had been implemented since the end of Goryeo dynasty when the islanders were frequently exposed to Japanese piracy. Since then, the repatriation policy continued to take effect during Joseon dynasty so as to effectively protect the islanders. Especially during the reign of King Taejong and King Sejong the Great, Ulleungdo and Dokdo islanders were removed from the islands multiple times. The islanders were repatriated twice under King Taejong’s reign (1403 and 1416) and three times during King Sejong the Great’s (1419, 1425 and 1438).네이버 지식백과 안용복 [安龍福] - 희생과 고난으로 독도를 지킨 조선의 백성 (인물한국사) It was the period when the islanders suffered again from the Japanese piracy (왜구, Wokou) and thus, no one lived in Ulleungdo and Dokdo from then on. Regardless of the repatriation policy, however, a lot of people visited Ulleungdo and Dokdo for fishing and gathering namul (나물, edible grass or leaves) during King Sukjong’s reign. Particularly, the country reached its peak of natural disaster during the period of King Sukjong, and thus famine and epidemic diseases were prevalent throughout Korean peninsula.[김호동. (2009). 조선 숙종조 영토분쟁의 배경과 대응에 관한 검토 검토 -안용복 활동의 새로운 검토를 위해-. 대구사학, 94(0), 57-92] In order to overcome such hardships from outbreak of famine and epidemics, people came to Ulleungdo and Dokdo, islands in East Sea that are rich in fishery resources, namul, and wild ginseng (산삼). According to An Yong-bok's statement in 1693, An Yong-bok visited Ulleungdo thanks to a group of fishermen who had already been to Ulleungdo for fishing.[장순순, S., & Jang. (2013). 17세기 후반 안용복의 피랍•도일사건과 의미. 이사부와 동해, 5, 161-196.] In particular, fishermen that lived on the shores of East Sea often visited Ulleungdo that is rich in abalone (전복) and seaweed (미역), as they were highly dependent on fishery for living rather than farming. Also, according to Yi Kyu-won’s ‘The Diary of Inspection on Ulleungdo (울릉도 감찰일기),’ he figured out that people often came to Ulleungdo for gathering namul and especially wild ginseng. In other words, in practice, people frequently visited the two islands in East Sea for fishing and gathering namul. = Japan = Japanese fishermen from Yonago of Tottori clan began fishing in Ulleungdo with approval from Tokugawa Shogunate and continued to secure its exclusive fishery rights. Although the license from the Shogunate was temporary, Japanese fishermen continued to use the short-term license and to fish in islands in East Sea.[장순순, S., & Jang. (2013). 17세기 후반 안용복의 피랍•도일사건과 의미. 이사부와 동해, 5, 167] In 1692, Japanese fishermen began to encounter groups of Korean fishermen while fishing, which led them to think that Koreans violated the exclusive fishery rights.  Capture and activities in Japan  The An Yong- bok incident occurred in the spring of 1693 when Korean fishermen from Busan and Ulsan clashed with other fisherman from Otani and Murakawa at Dokdo. An Yong-bok and Pak Eo-dun (박어둔) were captured and taken to the Yonago in the Tottri clan (modern-day Yonago city and Tottori Prefecture). The pair was detained at a house in Yonago for two months, while this case was investigated by the Tottori clan. The shogunate ordered his subjects to send them to the magistrate at Nagasaki, an area controlled by the Tsushima clan. An Yong-bok was held hostage by the lord of Tsushima clan (So Yoshitsugu) again. When An Yong-bok was repatriated to Korea, the Tokugawa Shogunate demanded the prohibition of Koreans going to Ulleung-do.[?馬藩政史料 （?元表書札方）?日記 元?六年六月三日?] \\"向後?不?候?二堅堅朝鮮表江被仰遣候?二御?元江被申越候?二と相模守申付候\\" This led to diplomatic friction between Japan and Korea. After An Yong-bok was repatriated to Korea, he testified that \\"the Kanpaku (Imperial regent) of the Tokugawa Shogunate made a note that confirmed Ulleungdo as Korean territory and he was in possession of the note until he was seized en route to Korea by the lord of Nagasaki, upon which the note was confiscated and he was held on the grounds of trespassing onto Japanese territory.\\" Korean scholars consider this testimony a fact.See Japanese government reconfirms Dokdo and Uleungdo as Korean territories at the end of 17th century on the Cyber Dokdo site. Japanese scholars, however, insist that this testimony is primarily Ahn's claim without supporting evidence because he did not go to Edo, the capitol of the Shogunate, and the Shogunate demanded Koreans be prohibited from going to Ulleung-do.See 鳥取藩政資料からみた竹島問題Shimane Prefectural Government, Accessed 24 July 2008See Ahn Yong-bok's statement This is an image of the Japanese 1695 documents recording Ahn Yong-bok's statement.

The Pine Creek Path was a major Native American trail in the U.S. State of Pennsylvania that ran north along Pine Creek from the West Branch Susquehanna River near Long Island (modern-day Jersey Shore) to the headwaters of the Genesee River (in modern-day Genesee Township, Pennsylvania). Course At the southern end of the trail there was a Native American village at the site of Jersey Shore and the Great Shamokin Path ran east–west here along the West Branch Susquehanna River. The Great Shamokin Path connected the Saponi village of Shamokin (modern Sunbury) on the Susquehanna River in the east, with the Great Island (modern Lock Haven) and villages further west (what are now the boroughs of Clearfield and Kittanning) and the Allegheny River. In the north another path continued north along the Genesee River and led to the Iroquois Nation in New York. The main Pine Creek Path followed Pine Creek north, switching banks until it reached the First Fork (modern Little Pine Creek at the village of Waterville). From there it stayed on the left bank the rest of its course along Pine Creek, passing through the Pine Creek Gorge to the Second Fork (Babb Creek at Blackwell) and on to the Third Fork (modern Marsh Creek) and the village of Ansonia. There it left the gorge and turned west, going past modern Galeton to West Pike, where it left the creek and headed north to the Genesee River. The exact course of the path between West Pike and the headwaters of the Genesee River are uncertain. In the south, an alternate branch (west of the main path) led north from the West Branch Susquehanna River along Chatham Run, past modern Woolrich to the main path near Waterville. Use The path was used by Iroquois warriors on their war raids to points south. One of the earliest accounts of the path is from Moses Van Campen, who was captured on Bald Eagle Creek in 1782, and taken north as a prisoner along the path. Some isolated bands of Native Americans remained in the Pine Creek Gorge until the War of 1812. When lumbering become a major industry along Pine Creek in the 19th century, the path was used by lumbermen. They would take rafts of lumber in the spring down Pine Creek from Ansonia to Jersey Shore, and then walk back north along the path. Attempts to convert the path into a wagon road early in the same century were unsuccessful - when John Peet tried it he said it took 18 days, crossed Pine Creek \\"eighty times going to and eighty times coming from\\", lost a wheel, broke two axles, and upset the wagon twice. In 1883, the Jersey Shore, Pine Creek and Buffalo Railway opened, following the course of the path from Jersey Shore to Ansonia. The railroad soon became the Pine Creek Railway, a part of the Fall Brook Coal Company. It was leased by the New York Central Railroad in 1899, and was consolidated into the New York Central Railroad in a 1914 corporate reorganization. The Pine Creek line was one of those taken over by Conrail in 1976, but the last train ran on the route on October 7, 1988. After the removal of the tracks, the right-of-way was converted to the Pine Creek Rail Trail, which was named one of \\"10 great places to take a bike tour\\" in the world in a 2001 USA Today article.

It was a preliminary operation undertaken on 25 June 1944 by XXX Corps of the British Second Army, to capture Rauray and the area around Noyers. The attack was to protect the right flank of VIII Corps as it began Operation Epsom, an offensive into the Odon Valley west of Caen, on 26 June. The 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division and the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division were to capture Juvigny-sur-Seulles, Vendes and Rauray, to prevent German counter-attacks against VIII Corps from the area of the Rauray Spur and then extend the attack towards Noyers and Aunay-sur-Odon. It was the first time in Normandy that the 49th (West Riding) Division operated as a division. The attack front was held by the right flank of the Panzer Lehr Division and the left flank of the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend, with the support of guns of the . The attack failed to achieve its objectives by the end of 25 June and the 49th (West Riding) Division continued the operation until 1 July, when the division defeated a counter-attack by of 2nd SS-Panzer Division and the 9th SS-Panzer Division , which lost and other armoured vehicles. The II SS Panzerkorps, had been intended for a counter-offensive west of Caen towards Bayeux but was so depleted by the losses of operations Martlet and Epsom and the danger of another British offensive near Caen, that it was reduced to static defence of the Odon valley. Background=Invasion of Normandy= The Norman town of Caen was the most important D-Day objective of I Corps of the British Second Army, which was to take Caen and form a front running from Caumont-l'Éventé in the west to the area south-east of Caen, to protect the eastern flank of the First US Army and form a jumping-off point for an advance southwards to capture Falaise. The 3rd Infantry Division landed on Sword Beach on 6 June but was stopped short of Caen by the 21st Panzer Division. Operation Perch, a pincer attack to encircle Caen, was begun by I Corps and XXX Corps the following day. I Corps attacked southwards out of the bridgehead on the east bank of the Orne and was halted by the 21st Panzer Division after advancing a short distance; the attack by XXX Corps was held up west of Caen, north of Tilly-sur-Seulles, by the Panzer Lehr Division. The 7th Armoured Division side-stepped westwards and attacked through a gap on the right flank opened by the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division and the 1st US Infantry Division, capturing the town of Villers-Bocage. German forces counter-attacked immediately and the Battle of Villers-Bocage ended in a costly stalemate. The vanguard of the 7th Armoured Division withdrew from the town and by 17 June, the Panzer Lehr Division had also been forced back and XXX Corps had taken Tilly-sur-Seulles. =Battle for Caen= Allied offensive operations were postponed when a severe storm hit the English Channel on 19 June, which delayed the Allied build-up for three days and left them three divisional disembarkations behind schedule. Operation Dreadnought, an attack from the Orne bridgehead by VIII Corps to outflank Caen from the east, was cancelled. The poor weather grounded most Allied aircraft until 23 June, allowing the Germans receive reinforcements relatively undisturbed and the equivalent of two German divisions, artillery and mortar units reached Normandy. Defensive positions were strengthened with minefields and about seventy 88 mm anti-tank guns were sited in hedgerows and woods on the approaches to Caen. On 23 June, the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division attacked Ste Honorine la Chardonnerette before dawn, captured the village and then repulsed a counter-attack, destroying thirteen German tanks. Further west, VIII Corps, which had recently arrived from England, was moved into line between XXX Corps and I Corps, to the west of Caen. Planning for an attack by VIII Corps on 26 June had begun and a preliminary attack by XXX Corps to capture high ground in the area west of VIII Corps was arranged for 25 June. Prelude=Plan= Operation Epsom, the VIII Corps attack due on 26 June, was vulnerable to a German counter-attack from the Rauray Spur, an area of high ground to the west, which overlooked the line of advance of 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division around the village of Cheux. On 25 June, XXX Corps was to conduct Operation Martlet, seizing the Noyers area to deprive the Germans of observation eastwards and the opportunity to counter-attack VIII Corps from the high ground. When the flank of VIII Corps had been secured, XXX Corps was to attack southwards towards Noyers and Aunay-sur-Odon. The 49th Division was to reach the first objective (\\"Barracuda\\") on the road between Juvigny and Fontenay, with three battalions and then advance south to the second objective (\\"Walrus\\") at Tessel Wood and the farm at St. Nicholas, with two fresh battalions. The division was then to advance to the final objective (\\"Albacore\\") at Rauray village and the Rauray Spur, to establish a line from Rauray to Vendes and Juvigny-sur-Seulles (Juvigny), to secure the right flank of the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division. The 49th Division planned to advance on a two-brigade front, with the 146th Infantry Brigade on the right and the 147th Infantry Brigade on the left, to its first phase objective at Fontenay and then to Rauray. The 8th Armoured Brigade and the 70th Infantry Brigade were held back in support; an extra field artillery regiment and a regiment of M10 tank destroyers were added to the divisional artillery and for the first day, five VIII Corps field artillery regiments and parts of two anti-aircraft brigades operating as ground artillery, were made available \\"on call\\". On the 50th Division front, a firm base was to be maintained, ready to follow up a German withdrawal. =German defences= Opposite XXX Corps, the German front was held by the Panzer Lehr Division and the left flank of the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend, which held a front from Epron north of Caen westwards to Fontenay. The divisions were supported by guns of the , from Saint-André-sur- Orne to Aunay-sur-Odon, which had instructions to engage Allied tanks at ranges greater than . South of the 49th Division, the German defences were held by the III Battalion, 26th SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment and tanks from the 12th SS Panzer Regiment from the 12th SS Panzer Division. Both regiments were dug in behind extensive minefields in well-camouflaged positions but had been in action since the invasion and were tired. By 24 June, the Hitler Youth had suffered casualties (about half of its infantry), had only Panzer IV tanks, and an unknown number of the ten tank destroyers in the division on 6 June. The Panzer Lehr Division had Panzer IVs, and a number of the forty and assault guns in the division on 1 June. Since the invasion the division had lost mostly from its infantry and was due to be relieved to refit, as soon as the 276th Division arrived from Belgium. Battle=25 June= At on the morning of 25 June, Operation Martlet commenced with a massed artillery bombardment, just ahead of the start line of the 49th Division. At the bombardment began to creep forward and the infantry advanced downhill through cornfields. A thick ground mist had developed, reducing visibility to in places. In the 146th Infantry Brigade area on the right flank, the 4th Lincolns and tanks of the 24th Lancers advanced and after an hour, their field radios became ineffective and the infantry struggled to keep direction, shouting to identify themselves as they advanced through mist, smoke and mortar bombs. A group of German half-tracks were destroyed by hand grenades and a German officer was shot while trying to signal with a bugle, as the battalion reached \\"Barracuda\\". As the sun rose, visibility increased to and a hot and sunny day began. On the left of 146th Brigade, the Hallamshire Battalion took compass bearings every few yards and reached \\"Barracuda\\" on the Fontenay–Tessel-Bretteville road, from where it came under fire from tanks of the 8th Company of II Battalion, 12th SS Panzer Regiment and two companies of III Battalion, 26th SS Panzergrenadier Regiment. The Hallamshires knocked out two German tanks with 6-pounder anti-tank guns and then advanced laterally in both directions along the road, westwards to le Pont de Juvigny (le Pont) and eastwards to Fontenay, through shell and mortar fire. At noon the Tyneside Scottish moved up to le Haut d'Audreu to consolidate the area and the 1/4th King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry advanced with the 24th Lancers through the 4th Lincolns, from the hamlet of Bas de Fontenay (Lower Fontenay), west of Fontenay village along the Juvigny road, to objective \\"Walrus\\" at Tessel Wood on the spur north of Vendes. The infantry advanced uphill and had made in four minutes behind a dense creeping bombardment, when a German Nebelwerfer bombardment began, slowing the advance and causing many casualties. The battalion eventually advanced to the edge of the wood. A counter-attack was repulsed and the 24th Lancers knocked out two German tanks. On the left flank, in the 147th Infantry Brigade area, the 11th Royal Scots Fusiliers advancing towards \\"Barracuda\\" on the northern fringe of Fontenay, disappeared into the mist and immediately had many casualties. Soldiers held on to each other to maintain direction and when the sun rose, snipers and machine-gunners in their path began to inflict more losses. The survivors reached Fontenay and began to fight through the village hand-to-hand; they then came under fire from Parc de Boislonde to the north-east and were unable to get beyond the road to Tilly. At the 1/7th Duke of Wellington's Regiment (1/7th Dukes) advanced through the remnants of the 11th RSF and continued the attack on the village. The III Battalion, 26th SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment, which had been reinforced by troops sent from Caen by the 21st Panzer Division and from Vendes by the Panzer Lehr Division, held on to the woods and the east end of the village. Hand-to-hand fighting went on in the village all night. By nightfall, the 49th Division had established a line roughly south-west from Fontenay, about short of Rauray and the high ground which had observation over the VIII Corps area. Cloud cover began to increase as plans were made for the Tyneside Scottish to attack Rauray at dawn. On the western flank of XXX Corps, the 50th Division had managed only to advance a short distance south of Tilly-sur-Seulles. German reserves behind the front opposite VIII Corps, had been moved west to reinforce the defenders attacked by XXX Corps, which was believed by the Germans to be the main axis of the British offensive. The weekly situation report by Army Group B for recorded that a gap wide and deep had been forced at the junction of the defences of the Panzer Lehr and 12th SS Panzer divisions. =26 June= The 70th Infantry and 8th Armoured brigades prepared to advance south of Fontenay at with Operation Epsom due to begin further west at On the left flank of the 49th Division, the 7th Dukes and the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry attacked towards \\"Walrus\\" at with the first objective being St. Nicholas farm, about away. The German garrison and hidden tanks repulsed the attack until when a second attempt after a twenty-minute artillery barrage, took the farm and ground beyond. The Yeomanry tanks then advanced to the crossroads north of Rauray and the 11th DLI arrived at to consolidate the position. A patrol lurked forward to the edge of the village for a night attack but found that despite a fighter-bomber attack with rockets during the day, the village was full of German infantry and the woods nearby were held by tanks. In the centre, the 1st Tyneside Scottish and the 4/7th Royal Dragoon Guards prepared to attack , with the right flank guarded by the 24th Lancers and the 12th (Motorised) Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps (12th KRRC) of the 8th Armoured Brigade, making an advance towards Tessel-Bretteville. The attack began with less artillery support, as much of the extra artillery made available on 25 June, reverted to the support of VIII Corps. German return fire from tanks and concealed machine-guns, forced the infantry under the cover of banks, which had been ranged by Nebelwerfers and were immediately bombarded. The rockets hit trees and hedges nearby and sent lethal wood splinters everywhere. Beyond stream, four dug-in tanks held up the attack, as well as a company of infantry in and infantry reinforcements from the 21st Panzer Division, dug in around Tessel Wood. The 12th KRRC crossed le Bordel Rau stream at midday but was pinned down beyond and six Dragoon Guard tanks were knocked out attacking the farm. At the infantry were withdrawn to le Haut d'Audrieu, except for a small party which reached the farm. The 12th KRRC, mounted mainly in M3 Half-tracks and Universal Carriers, attacked towards Tessel-Bretteville as the Shermans of the 24th Lancers moved past the east side of Tessel Wood. The British were engaged by the tanks at and others near Tessel-Bretteville. Two Panthers met the leading squadron of the Lancers, one tank each being hit and set on fire. The advance was limited by the bocage and sunken lanes but reached stream. The attackers then reached the west end of the village, before retiring to Tessel Wood under a smoke screen, due to the number of tank and other vehicle losses. During the night, two companies from II Battalion, 192nd Panzer Grenadier Regiment of the 21st Panzer Division, came up to bolster the defences of the Panzer Lehr Division near Vendes, which remained in German hands for the duration of the operation. The Panzer Lehr Division had briefly engaged elements of 146th Brigade but most of it remained concentrated against the 50th Division on the right flank of the 49th Division. =27 June= At Yeomanry tanks and a patrol from the 11th DLI began to probe into Rauray against the III Battalion, 26th SS Panzergrenadier Regiment. Flanking fire from tanks and knocked out several Yeomanry tanks and forced the rest to withdraw. A platoon of the DLI fought their way into the village centre but the rest of the battalion was bombarded by mortar fire, directed by a concealed observer. After an artillery bombardment at the DLI fixed bayonets and advanced in line abreast through machine-gun and sniper fire, which caused many casualties and led to a truce being arranged at noon, for both sides to recover wounded. The attack resumed at and by the village had been captured; several German snipers were found to have been camouflaged and tied to trees. To the west of Tessel-Bretteville, the Hallamshires attacked towards Vendes from Tessel Wood but made little progress and preparations were made to attack Brettevillette next day. =28 June= At a barrage by four field artillery regiments and the guns of an Army Group Royal Artillery (AGRA) began and on the left flank, the attack by the 10th DLI and the 4/7th Dragoon Guards resumed through the positions of the 11th DLI in Rauray, towards the high ground south of the village, where the fighting went on all day. At the 1st Tyneside Scottish in the centre, advanced through the bocage close to the creeping barrage, towards the objective of Brettevillette south-west of Rauray. The battalion reached the first objective \\"Jock\\" (Tessel-Bretteville) after forty minutes, where two companies consolidated and two pushed on towards the final objective \\"Jones\\" (Brettevillette) behind another creeping barrage. German machine-gun fire became intense and the rear of the battalion was bombarded by artillery and mortars but the advance continued and by the battalion had entered the village. After thirty minutes the British were counter-attacked by of the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich, which had arrived the day before from the area south of St. Lô and relieved the 12th SS Panzer Division west of Rauray. With a Panther company of the 2nd Panzer Division the began several hours of mutually costly counter-attacks as the Tyneside Scottish tried to consolidate their positions in the village. The battalion was withdrawn to Tessel-Bretteville by with an advanced company dug in north of Brettevillette. By recovering the village and holding Queudeville to the south, had kept open a route from Noyers-Bocage for a forthcoming counter-offensive by the II SS Panzer Corps against the VIII Corps salient to the east. =29–30 June= The weather on the morning of 29 June was bright and clear and Allied aircraft conducted many ground attack sorties and reconnaissance flights, which found that many German reinforcements were heading for the Odon area. The German counter-offensive by the , took place south of the 49th Division, either side of the Odon river between Queudeville and Évrecy, against the VIII Corps salient. XXX Corps provided artillery support to VIII Corps and prepared to defend the ground around Rauray. The 1st Tyneside Scottish found that any movement attracted massed mortar fire from and a tank periodically harassed the company dug in north of the village. The company was withdrawn to avoid an artillery barrage, preparatory to an attack on the village by the 11th DLI but as soon as the move was spotted, a bombardment began and caused many casualties. The battalion was relieved at on 30 June, by the 4th Battalion The Lincolnshire Regiment (4th Lincolns). and artillery fire fell on the 10th DLI and 4/7th Dragoon Guards south of Rauray during the day, where several tanks were lost while reconnoitring the forward slope. On 30 June, the two Durham battalions were relieved at Rauray by the Tyneside Scottish, which sent patrols forward in the evening. The Tyneside Scottish selected as a tank killing ground, an area east and south-east of in front of A and B companies, which had the only good field of observation and dug in four 6-pounder anti-tank guns by the evening. Patrols were sent forward but discovered little because of the poor view in the bocage. The 11th RSF held the right flank near Juvigny, in touch with the 50th Division to the west and the 1/4th KOYLI to the east, who were at the western edge of Tessel Wood. The Hallamshires held the south-west corner of the wood, a little to the north of Vendes and linked with the 4th Lincolns at Tessel-Bretteville. The 11th DLI were dug in near Rauray and linked with the Tyneside Scottish on the high ground at Across the divisional and corps boundary to the east, along the road to le Haut du Bosq, the 6th King's Own Scottish Borderers (6th KOSB) of the 15th (Scottish) Division were dug in on the south side of the road, an obvious avenue of attack against VIII Corps. Only the units near had a relatively unhampered view, the other battalions being hemmed in by banks, hedgerows and trees. The three 49th Division artillery regiments, tanks of the 24th Lancers, anti-tank guns of the 217th Anti-tank Regiment RA, two dummy 6-pounder anti- tank guns and the Vickers machine-guns of the 2nd Kensingtons, were made ready to support of the infantry. Wireless intelligence, gleaned from the , led to Bomber Command dropping of bombs during the evening on suspected German tank concentrations at Villers-Bocage which, along with a naval and artillery bombardment, obliterated the town in twelve minutes. =German counter-attack, 1 July= During the night of much activity and the sound of tracked vehicles was heard behind the German front by patrols. The 50th Division had continued its attacks south-west of Tilly-la-Campagne and captured Hottot-les-Bagues twice, before losing it to counter-attacks; Longraye had been captured to the west. In the morning the 56th Brigade, on the right flank of the 50th Division, took over the line north of Bois de Saint Germain and Crauville, then began vigorous patrolling against the 277th Infantry Division and the tanks of the 2nd Panzer Division, ready for an attack on the wood on 8 July. The Germans had planned a big night attack against the VIII Corps salient for on 1 July by and the 9th SS Panzer Division but the commander of the division, Woith, was wounded by artillery fire and failed to pass on the attack order in time. It was also found that the tanks of the 9th SS Panzer Regiment had retired after dark and the attack was postponed until At midnight a bombardment by mortars and artillery began on the British positions; patrols reported that tanks could be heard south of Brettevillette and soon after, the Tyneside Scottish were ordered to stand to, ready for sunrise at At , with the 19th and 20th SS Panzergrenadier regiments and the 9th SS Panzer Regiment from the 9th SS Panzer Division, began to advance through a smoke screen towards , south of le Haut du Bosq on the Cheux road. Groups of five tanks advanced accompanied by Panzergrenadiers, fired on the British infantry as the troops deployed and then moved forward. Other groups advanced on an arc from east to north-east, into the defences of the 6th KOSB and the 4th Lincolns from Rauray to Tessel-Bretteville. The 24th Lancers and the divisional artillery opened fire German tank-infantry groups as they emerged from the smoke screen at about German tactics reflected the vulnerability of tanks and infantry once they emerged from the bocage, against which the British replied with anti-tank fire from camouflaged positions, although to gain a field of fire the guns were dug in close to hedgerows, which disclosed the approximate position of the guns. German fire on the anti-tank positions increased in accuracy during the engagement and they were destroyed one-by-one. The German artillery alternated HE and smoke bombardments so that the tanks could emerge from the smoke-screen, engage suspected British positions and then move on supported by infantry. The British field artillery then forced the German tanks to retire and the infantry to get under cover, while the German artillery resumed the HE bombardment; each German thrust inflicted casualties on the British and went further forward. German snipers and parties of machine-gunners infiltrated the British outpost line around Rauray and the positions of the Tyneside Scottish. By the British outpost line had been overrun on both sides of the track. A line of 17-pounder anti-tank guns of 344 Antitank Battery RA near le Haut-du- Bosq, became the front line despite the restricted view. When A Company of the Tyneside Scottish was forced back into the 6th KOSB area, German tanks and Panzergrenadiers swung north, behind B Company, where they were engaged by tanks of the 24th Lancers. Six German tanks were knocked out and the advance was stopped; artillery was called for around Brettevillette. Much of the artillery support had responded to calls by artillery observers for Defensive Fire task and had fallen in the area in front of the Tyneside Scottish and the KOSB. During the afternoon, an artillery observer in the Belleval Château saw German tanks forming up in a triangular wood and called for The call was revised to a \\"Mike Target\\" (to be engaged by all of the field regiment), then revised to an \\"Uncle target\\" (bombardment by the of all three divisional field artillery regiments) and revised again to a \\"Victor Target\\", (a bombardment including all of the medium and heavy guns of VIII Corps). A similar call was made on the guns of XXX Corps and a huge bombardment fell on the German staging area. Later in the day British troops re-occupied the outpost line, supported by Churchill Crocodile flame-throwers, which flamed hedgerows and forced the German infantry into the open, many of whom ran back rather than attempt to surrender and were shot down. On the front of the 10th DLI, 11th DLI and the 4th Lincolns, German infantry encroached on defensive positions but were pushed out by counter-attacks, which were costly for both sides. C Squadron of the Sherwood Rangers lost two tanks in support of the 10th DLI and the 55th Anti-Tank Regiment RA, which was deployed behind the DLI battalions, knocked out six Panthers. Aftermath=Analysis= In 2003, Terry Copp wrote that the German counter-attack against the ground captured by XXX Corps was a costly failure and that the Germans holding the remaining positions on the Rauray Spur were reduced to passive defence. German armoured units had encountered the same problems of lack of observation and room for manoeuvre as the Allies. A shortage of infantry and the effect of Allied artillery fire made co-operation much more difficult and made direct command almost impossible. Operation Martlet had achieved its purpose in distracting and inflicting attrition on the German forces opposite. Ian Daglish wrote in 2007, that although XXX Corps had failed to reach its objective, German attention was diverted from the area of Operation Epsom and that tanks in the area had been sent westwards to counter-attack the gap forced by the 49th Division, leaving them out of position when the main attack by VIII Corps began. In a report on the battle of 1 July written the same day, Lieutenant-Colonel A. E. Warhurst called the German repulse a severe defeat, in which had been committed. Warhurst estimated that tanks had been knocked out, ten to the Tyneside Scottish, eleven to the 24th Lancers, six to the 217th Battery, 55th Anti-tank Regiment and five to a barrage from the medium artillery; five Shermans were lost by the 24th Lancers. Each of the mortars of the Tyneside Irish fired and the artillery inflicted many losses on the Germans, because the British were able to maintain excellent signal communications all day, while German radio operators had to be stationed at a distance from their headquarters, due to the speed with which British wireless listening posts plotted their positions and directed artillery fire onto them. In 2013, John Buckley wrote that the German defence against Martlet had been poorly co- ordinated and was costly against the firepower at the disposal of the British, a tactical phenomenon encountered by the Germans all through the Normandy campaign. Martlet had succeeded in diverting German forces from Operation Epsom but that the German success in holding Rauray Ridge was a British failure, which left the Germans in a commanding position, even when Rauray was captured. =Casualties= In June, the assembly of the 2nd SS Panzer Division in Normandy was incomplete; on 1 July, the division had an establishment of but only at the battlefront. and the 9th SS Panzer Division defended the Rauray Spur and participated in the counter-offensive against Operation Epsom. The lost (until 1 July inclusive) killed, and The 9th SS Panzer Division had until 1 July (inclusive) and the number of operational fell from 41 to 9 in June and rose to ten on 2 July, the number Panthers fell from 27 to 19 between the number of fell from 38 to 22 in June and to 19 on 2 July. The left flank units and reinforcements from the 12th SS Panzer Division were engaged against XXX Corps and from 24 June to 11 July, the division lost in the three days to 1 July inclusive. From 24 June to 2 July, the number of operational tanks fell from 58 to 32 Panzer IV, 44 to 24 Panthers and an unknown number of . The Panzer Lehr Division was slowly relieved by the 276th Infantry Division from 26 June to 5 July and suffered in June. From 24 to 26 June the number of operational fell from 33 to 27, Panthers from 30 to 26; the number of operational and is unknown. By 1 July, availability had recovered to and . The 21st Panzer Division lost from 24 to 30 June and another by 6 July. From 21 June to 1 July, the number of operational fell from 76 to 61, although it is not known which losses occurred in action against XXX Corps during Operation Martlet. The number of operational Tiger tanks available to the 101st fell from 15 to 11 between 16 June and 1 July and from 11 to none by 4 July. The 49th (West Riding) Division casualties were Scottish, and in the 4th Lincolns. =Subsequent operations= The 49th Division held the line around Rauray for almost a month, except for a diversionary attack around Juvigny during the Second Battle of the Odon. On 30 July, the division was transferred from XXX Corps to I Corps and took post in the bridgehead east of the River Orne, from where it advanced to the Seine. The 12th SS-Panzer Division , severely depleted by the Epsom battles, continued fighting against further British offensives at Carpiquet airfield (Operation Windsor), Caen (Operation Charnwood) and Operation Goodwood. It settled in a position south-east of Caen in mid-July, from where it was gradually forced back by the later Anglo- Canadian offensives. The 9th SS-Panzer Division remained in the Odon Valley, holding Hill 112 against the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division during Operation Jupiter. It too was eventually pushed back into the Falaise Pocket.

The Dollis Hill Synagogue is a former Orthodox Jewish house of worship in Dollis Hill, London, England. The congregation first came together in the early part of the 20th century, following an increase of Jewish immigration from the European continent to London. The congregation first met in a private house, then began to rent meeting halls in order to accommodate an increase in worshippers. The original synagogue was created in 1933 for £1,400, but the congregation quickly outgrew it and in February 1937 construction began on a larger building.“Synagogues of Europe: Architecture, History, Meaning” by Carol Herselle Krinsky, Google Books Designed by Sir Owen Williams, who served as both architect and engineer on the project, the completed two-storey concrete structure was designed to accommodate 324 men at ground level and 316 women at gallery level. The synagogue's design featured two unusual window patterns that were meant to suggest Jewish religious symbolism: a hexagon, which Williams meant to suggest the Star of David, and an inverted arch, which was inspired by the outline of a seven-candle menorah. Although the building was consecrated in 1938 as a district member of the United Synagogue, the congregation expressed displeasure with the finished structure and Williams returned a portion of his design fee in view of this dissatisfaction.“Dollis Hill Synagogue,” Engineering Timelines In January 1947, Dollis Hill Synagogue was one of several London synagogues that were vandalised following news of the whipping of kidnapped British troops by Jewish terrorists in the British Mandate of Palestine. Religious books were destroyed by an incensed crowd and graffiti bearing the message \\"You whip, we burn\\" was scrawled on the wall.“Britain Says Funds of U.S. Abet Terror,” New York Times, January 6, 1947 (fee required for access) In June 1993, Dollis Hill Synagogue was one of seven British congregations named by United Synagogue as having had “chronic deficits.” By this period, the congregation’s numbers had dropped to 300 families, with half of the congregation over the age of 70. In February 1995, the building was sold to the organizers of the Avigdor Hirsch Torah Temimah Primary School.American Jewish Year Book 1996, page 248 The synagogue's congregation moved its religious services to a smaller adjacent building. The services subsequently reverted to the use of what had since become the school hall in the original synagogue building. By 2011, and following many years of continuing declining membership, the congregation numbered approximately 130 members, mostly aged over 70, and in many cases no longer living close to the synagogue; and the congregation, which had for some time ceased holding religious services other than on Saturday mornings (the Sabbath) and holy days, found itself unable to muster a regular minyan (quorum) for services. In July 2011 the decision was taken to formally disband the congregation.Jewish Chronicle, London, 15 July 2011 p. C2 The building is now part of the Torah Temimah Primary School.

Founded in 1849 by German Jews, its 1856 synagogue building was the smallest in the United States. The congregation was originally Orthodox, but rapidly moved to \\"Classical Reform\\". In the 1930s and 1940s an influx of more traditional Eastern European Jews prompted a change from Classical Reform to Traditional Reform. The congregation was always small, and went through long periods where it had no rabbi. During other periods, particularly from 1939 to 1954, rabbis' tenures were very short, often a year or less. , Allan L. Smith, has served as the congregation's rabbi for over 40 years. Their current Rabbi is Elliott Kleinman. The synagogue building was the second oldest in the United States still occupied by its original congregation. History The congregation was founded by Jews of German background. In the spring of 1849 the first Jewish family settled in Honesdale, and by the fall the congregation had been organized. By 1854 the congregation also had a Hebrew school. Originally Orthodox, the congregation moved rapidly to \\"Classical Reform\\". The congregation's first spiritual leader was a Rabbi Kutner. Between 1880 and 1890 many Jewish families left Honesdale. The congregation was able to maintain a full-time local rabbi until 1891, but could not afford one after that. Rabbis (typically student rabbis from the Reform Hebrew Union College or Jewish Institute of Religion) would officiate only at High Holiday and some festival services. Other services were held on Friday nights, and were lay-led. At the turn of the century and in the early 20th century, Honesdale had two synagogues, Beth Israel and Sherith Israel. Nevertheless, the Jewish community remained small; by 1918 there were only 29 Jews in Honesdale, Beth Israel was the only synagogue, and it had no rabbi. In the 1930s and 1940s an influx of more traditional Jews of Eastern European backgrounds prompted a slow change to more traditional practices (though still Reform). By 1942, the Jewish population of Honesdale had reached around 75. The bulk of the costs associated with running the synagogue were underwritten by Honesdale's Katz Underwear Company, with additional funds raised by the Temple Sisterhood. From the late 1930s to the early 1950s the congregation was served by a series of short-tenured rabbis, typically serving one year or less. These included Joseph Friedman (1939), Baruch Braunstein (1940–1942), Hebrew Weiner (1943–1944), Rafield Helman (1945), Jay Robert Brinkman (1946), Morris Friedman (1947), Jerome Spivak (1948), Bernard Bamburger (1949), Samuel Volkman (1949), Abraham Granison (1949), Bernard Perlmutter (1950), Harold Spevak (1951), Bernard Zlotovitz (1952), Kenneth Rivkin (1953), Jerome Davidson (1954), and Julius Kravitz (1958). Beth Israel had no rabbi in the 1960s, and in the 1970s was served by Harvey Rosenfeld (1970–1971), Lewis Bogage (1972–1978), and Leonard Troop (1978). Bogage shared the duties with Allan L. Smith. Since 1979, Smith has served as rabbi on his own. The congregation celebrated its 125th anniversary in 1974, with rabbi and historian Jacob Rader Marcus as speaker. Rabbi Smith retired in 2015. Rabbi Elliott Kleinman has served the congregation from that time to the present. Building Beth Israel's Colonial meeting house-style building, dedicated in 1856, was for many years the smallest synagogue in the United States, and possibly the world. Constructed of white clapboard, it had a gold Star of David at the tip of its spire. The building held 50 to 85 people. The land for the synagogue building was donated by a non-Jew, who also donated money towards its construction. The synagogue was built by the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company to attract Jewish merchants. The company installed pews with kneelers underneath them, not realizing that Jews do not normally kneel in prayer. The congregation left them in, \\"partly as a gesture of recognition that they were installed in good faith\\". It is one of the oldest synagogues in the United States; only Congregation Kahal Kadosh Beth Elohim has been in the same building longer. In 1933 \\"gothic type\\" stained glass windows were added to the building. These were lost during a flood one Friday night in 1942, when the Lackawaxen River overflowed its banks. An annex was added in 1962, which, at the time caused great controversy among the members. The building underwent a restoration in 1985. The sanctuary is decorated with \\"a magnificent chandelier and Tiffany globe sconces\\". , it was the second oldest synagogue building in the United States still occupied by its original congregation. Recent events Rabbi and head of the Union for Reform Judaism Alexander Schindler was speaker at the 150th anniversary in 1999. Beth Israel's current membership is \\"a combination of long time local residents, as well as those who have relocated to Northeastern Pennsylvania from nearby metropolitan areas such as New York, New Jersey, and Philadelphia. Members come from Wayne, Pike, Monroe, Lackawanna, and Susquehanna\\" counties. Unlike most Jewish congregations, Beth Israel does not require attendees to pay for High Holy Day tickets. , the rabbi was Allan L. Smith. He had served the congregation since 1972, and for much of that time also served as the Director of the Youth Division of the Union for Reform Judaism. Rabbi Smith retired in 2015. Rabbi Elliott Kleinman has served from that time to the present.

Stuckey voluntarily left the Patriots at the beginning of the 1999 season to adopt his brother, who had gotten into serious criminal difficulty in Alabama. In his online autobiography, he also indicated that his \\"heart wasn't in the game\\". Financial concerns compelled Stuckey to re-enter professional football, and he signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who allocated him to the Amsterdam Admirals of NFL Europe. After his season with Amsterdam, Stuckey was placed on injured reserve by Tampa Bay due to an injury sustained with the Admirals. After his recovery, Stuckey signed with the Los Angeles Xtreme of the XFL, where he played on their 2001 world-championship team. Later he played for the Indiana Firebirds of the Arena Football League before injuries forced him to give up football for good.

He was the chief executive officer of International Harvester in the 1970s, and was the family's final member to lead the company that they had founded.  Early life and education  Born February 23, 1917 in Chicago, Illinois, to the distinguished McCormick family, McCormick was a great- grandnephew of Cyrus McCormick, whose 19th century development of the horse- drawn reaper was the start of a large agricultural machinery business. His father, Chauncey McCormick (1884–1954), was a cousin of Chicago Tribune publisher Robert R. McCormick, and his mother, Marion Deering, was a daughter of Charles Deering. Charles' father William Deering had founded the Deering Harvester Company, which merged with the McCormicks' harvester business in 1902 to form the basis for International Harvester. Chauncey and Marion Deering wed in 1914. Brooks McCormick attended the Groton School in Massachusetts. He graduated from Yale University in 1940 with a degree in English.  Work at International Harvester  McCormick joined International Harvester out of Yale, working for the company from 1940 until retiring in 1980. He was groomed for executive positions his entire career, and he became president and chief operating officer in 1968. He was promoted to be chief executive officer from 1971 until January 1978. During his tenure, McCormick tried to stem financial losses at International Harvester by selling the company's Wisconsin Steel subsidiary and exiting the money-losing pickup truck manufacturing business. McCormick stepped down as the chairman of International Harvester's executive committee on October 31, 1980, ending almost 150 years of his family's active management in the company. He had no interest in nepotism, and saw little reason to be sad about the passing of the McCormicks' role in the company. \\"There's no room in this world for emotionalism or sentimentality,\\" he told the Chicago Tribune at the time of his retirement.  Equestrian activities  In the 1920s, McCormick's father Chauncey purchased a massive horse farm in what is now unincorporated Warrenville, Illinois. The property eventually was expanded to more than and became known as St. James Farm. McCormick took possession of the property after his father's death in September 1954 and significantly expanded it, holding an annual steeplechase event on the property to raise money for charity. McCormick said that his goal behind the steeplechase event was \\"to revive public interest in a major equestrian sport missing in this area for half a century.\\" In 2000, McCormick sold the farm for $43 million to the Forest Preserve District of DuPage County, with the stipulation that it would take possession of the farm upon McCormick's death. A condition of a bequest related to the sale was the demolition of several structures on the property, including McCormick's own mansion, which had been designed by noted architect Jarvis Hunt. It is now known as St. James Farm Forest Preserve.  Philanthropy  A noted philanthropist and art collector, McCormick bequeathed 11 works of art to the Art Institute of Chicago upon his death in 2006, including paintings by Édouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Winslow Homer, Paul Cézanne, and John Singer Sargent. McCormick had been president of the Art Institute's board from 1944 until 1954. McCormick also willed his collection of rare bird books and paintings to the International Crane Foundation, which reaped more than $2.7 million from their sale after his death.Auction house trip was experience - GazetteXtra  Family  McCormick's wife, former Illinois state legislator Hope Baldwin McCormick, died in 1993.

It was designed to attack modern fortifications, but its short range and ineffective ammunition led to the development of the more deservedly famous 30.5 cm Mörser M 11 and M 16. History Based on a Krupp 1888–1890 design, Skoda developed a new heavy mortar on a middle pivot mounting for testing in 1896. However, the authorities realised that advancing technology required a newer design using a barrel in a cradle mounted on a hydraulic recoil system. While introduced in November 1900, it wasn't quite ready and went through a number of minor improvements. One major problem was weak recoil springs that would allow the barrel to slip out of its cradle while elevated. Leather and horsehair stoppers could be wedged in the cradle as a short-term fix. But the permanent fix had to wait until the M 98/7 version that extended the jacket surrounding the barrel to the muzzle and redesigned the cradle was produced after 1907.Ortner pg 252 It was notable as the first weapon with a modern recoil system to see service with the Austro- Hungarian artillery as well as the first design to require motor traction. It was broken down into four loads for this purpose. Its carriage was mounted on a static firing platform that was jacked up and down onto its prepared bedding. It could only be loaded at 0° elevation.

History The procession for Teofilo Braga passing the site of the synagogue on Rua Alexandre Herculano The entrance to the Shaare Tikva Synagogue along Rua Alexandre Herculano There have been Jews in Lisbon at least since the Middle Ages, but the community suffered a major blow in 1497, when an edict by King Manuel I ordered Jews either to convert to Christianity or to leave the country. All synagogues of Lisbon were confiscated by the King and given to Christian religious orders. For the Jews that converted to Catholicism, called New Christians (cristãos novos), the establishment of the Portuguese Inquisition in 1536 meant a permanent danger of being persecuted. The situation for Judaism in Portugal changed at the beginning of the 19th century, when the Portuguese Inquisition was abolished and Sephardi Jews from Morocco and Gibraltar, mostly merchants, started to migrate to Lisbon and other parts of Portugal. During the whole 19th century, the small Lisbon Jewish community had no formal synagogue and had to celebrate their religious rites in private houses. The tentative construction of a Jewish synagogue occurred in the 19th century, but there were difficulties, namely those associated with its official recognition by Portuguese monarchists. An official request to construct the synagogue occurred on 4 March 1897, which was sent to London and Lourenço Marques on 12 October. A commission was established to study its construction, nominated by the Jewish community in Lisbon, represented by Leão Amezalak, Abrahão Anahory, Mark Seruya, Jacob Levy Azancot, Saul Cagi and Jaime Pinto. On 23 August 1901, the license was signed to buy the land along Rua Alexandre Herculano. In 1902, though, the lands were donated to the Israeli Committee in Lisbon, and a plan was elaborated by Miguel Ventura Terra (1866-1919), recommended by a commission headed by Joaquim Bensaúde. The plan allowed an operating space that could allow 400 men and 200 women to celebrate their religious worship. On 25 May the cornerstone was laid for the construction of the building by Abraham E. Levy. The synagogue was inaugurated on 18 May 1904, after work by builders Pereira de Campos: it was the first synagogue to be built in Portugal, since the late 15th century. On the same year, a painting was executed by Veloso Salgado. In 1940 a commission was established to collect funds for the repair of the roof, which was reconstituted again in 1948. A plan was elaborated by architect Carlos Ramos for the repair of the synagogue. In May 1949, the synagogue was reopened, during a solemn ceremony with the presence of the Chief Rabbi of Paris, Jacob Kaplan. In December 1995, the building was proposed for heritage classification. A solemn ceremony marking the 100 years of its construction was celebrated in December 2004. Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio and Israel's Sephardi Chief Rabbi Shlomo Amar were among the speakers. Architecture Interior of the Shaarei Tikva synagogue, from the ground floor, where men pray. Women pray in the upper galleries The synagogue is located in an urban landscape, concealed within the block behind a fence and wall, recessed in an oblique building from the streets. The main facade of the synagogue faces an inner courtyard, since Portuguese law in the 19th century forbade non-Catholic religious temples from facing the street. Ventura Terra conceived a temple in a style mixing Neo-Byzantine and Neo- Romanesque, consistent with the Synagogue architecture in the Moorish Revival. The synagogue is a rectangular, symmetrical building oriented west to east oriented towards Jerusalem, with an ample interior spaces, a posterior support spaces and an exterior towards an elevated area. The principal facade of the synagogue has its foundations, corners and decorative capstones in stone, with rectangular windows framed in geometric lattices. The three registers are divided between second and third floor a by a frieze, that divide rectangular windows from three rounded windows in the pediment. The main doorway includes a Gothic-like portico and doorway flanked by pilasters, used by male members of the congregation, while on the left lateral facade includes another access female members. The posterior facade has three windows in arc, with two rectangular windows on either side. The entranceway is composed of a vestibule, support hall, with access to basement (location of the washrooms and mikve) and access to the upper floors and gallery. The annex (to the right of the principal facade) connects to the second gallery, an apartment and integrates (to the west) with the washrooms. The interior includes three elements. At the middle of the temple, is a central wing, that extends over the three floors, and by lateral wings divided by pillars and galleries.

Hooker, an eight- time All-American, left the University of Texas as one of the most decorated student-athletes in the program's history. Hooker, a corporate communications major, made her mark as one of the top athletes in collegiate track and field during the 2005 outdoor season, when she helped Texas to its fourth NCAA outdoor title. Hooker became UT's third NCAA 100-meter champion and its first since 1991, when she claimed the event in 11.14 seconds.

It is the site where the San Diego Presidio and the San Diego Mission, the first European settlements in what is now the Western United States, were founded in 1769. In 1773 the mission moved a few miles upriver while the fort remained on Presidio Hill. The presidio had been established to protect against Indian attacks or foreign invasions. As the need for such protection disappeared, people preferred to live in Old Town at the foot of the hill, and the fort was gradually abandoned. It was in ruins by 1835. In 1907 George Marston, a wealthy department store owner and civic leader, bought Presidio Hill with the aim of preserving the historic site. Unable to attract city funding, Marston built a private park (planned by architect John Nolan) including the Serra Museum (designed by architect William Templeton Johnson) in 1925. Marston donated the park to the city in 1929.Journal of San Diego History, Summer 1969 The park encompasses about and has views of the city, the San Diego River valley, and the Pacific Ocean. The grounds are open for picnics and play. The facilities can be used for weddings and other special events. The spot in the park where Junípero Serra planted a palm tree when he first arrived in 1769 was declared a California Historical Landmark. Otherwise, no historical structures remain in Presidio Park today. The site is occasionally used for archaeological excavations. A fenced-off area encloses the foundations of the chapel, walls, and other historical sites. Junípero Serra Museum The Junípero Serra Museum is operated by the San Diego Historical Society and features displays about the city's founding.Serra Museum website Built in 1925, the Serra Museum, with its Mission architecture, is sometimes erroneously called the Presidio. The Junípero Serra Museum exhibits archeological finds, historic objects, and reference materials related to Spanish colonization and the early history of California and provides educational programs about the Spanish, Mexican and indigenous heritage of the San Diego region. The Serra Museum was the original home of the San Diego Historical Society, founded in 1929 by philanthropist George Marston. The organization, renamed the San Diego History Center, relocated to Balboa Park in 1982.

Founded by Joe Motes and Ruthanne Devlin in 1986, Vulkon produced its first convention in 1987 (making Vulkon and its predecessor Trekon one of the oldest and longest-running conventions in the state of Florida). Vulkon Entertainment organized five to ten conventions each year in many cities across America, as well as science fiction-themed cruises. The conventions were often Star Trek-centric, but usually included actors from other science fiction television series. Overview Vulkon conventions programming included cosplay, dances, panels, workshops, game shows, banquets, karaoke, video games, artist alley, a dealers room, and once (the Halloween 2008 show) even hosted an actual wedding done in traditional Klingon fashion. Vulkon historically attracted 1,000-3,000 visitors from all over the United States. However, in the face of the American economic recession of 2008 and 2009 the number of visitors started to dwindle, and the choice was made to cancel the first two shows of 2009, which had been scheduled for March of that year. The Vulkon franchise was officially put on hiatus shortly thereafter.  History  Co-founder Joe Motes had produced prior conventions under different names as far back as October 31, 1976, at the Howard Johnson's, in Golden Glades, Florida, featuring a costume party/contest, bloopers, dealers, etc.A flyer from that event advertised \\"next convention this location, November 28, 1976\\". In June 1984. Joe Motes organized \\"Trekon\\". In 1986, Motes teamed up with Ruthanne Devlin in Miami to form Vulkon Entertainment. The first official Vulkon was held in Orlando in October 1987. Between 1987 and 2007, Vulkon produced 12 Star Trek / Buffy the Vampire Slayer cruises, sailing with 8-15 stars on each cruise under the names \\"Trekruise\\", \\"Seatrek\\" and \\"Slayercruise\\". From 1996 to 2000, Vulkon Entertainment teamed up with actor William Campbell to promote five \\"Fantasticons\\". raising over $400,000 for the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital. Each of these conventions drew hundreds of stars and thousands of fans. In 1999, Devlin sold her half of the company to Motes and retired to Seattle, Washington. In 1999, Fernando Martinez became partners with Motes until 2005. Ruthanne Devlin died on February 10, 2015. In 2007, the Vulkon company and name were sold to Gary and Terri Tripp of Weston, Florida. When Joe Motes retired, he was the second longest-running promoter in America next to Creation Entertainment promoters Gary Berman and Adam Malin.

When they reached Monterey, however, they were not sure it was the right place and decided to continue north. The party reached San Pedro Creek on October 31 and camped there for four nights, while scouts led by José Francisco Ortega climbed Sweeney Ridge, where they could see over the ridge toward the east, and so became the first Europeans to see San Francisco Bay on November 1. The scouts returned on November 3, and led the entire party up to the ridge on November 4. Franciscan missionary Juan Crespi noted in his diary, \\"from the summit of a peak we beheld the great estuary or arm of the sea.\\" After seeing the immense bay to the east, and having learned from the scouts that further progress to the north would be blocked by the Golden Gate, the party turned southeast and descended toward the bay.

On his way into the court room he was served with legal documents and a summons before proceedings even started. He was examined in detail over various financial transactions, including family travel payments and transactions surrounding the purchase of his Mosman Park mansion and claimed that he was forced to buy the property by his close friend and occasional antagonist Warren Anderson. In earlier evidence he claimed that Anderson forced him to pay A$4 million into Anderson's family company, Owston Nominees, then received a loan from Owston Nominees the following day to the value of A$5.8 million to allow the purchase of the property. Johnston was accompanied later in the day by his wife Sandra and two daughters. Sandra Johnston had fled to Bali after the seizure of Johnston's passports, concerned at her own potential liability due to her position as a company director between 2005 and 2008. She stayed in the Nusa Dua Asmara cliffside villa built by Gordon Hill when he was a director of Firepower and purchased with Firepower funds. While at the villa she was allegedly intimidated by tattooed men and mystery packages.

The report added that other dealers were expected to be targeted, including the private companies of property tycoon Warren Anderson and Sydney lawyer Les Stein, both of whom were heavily involved in Firepower. IMF managing director Hugh McLernon said \\"We will probably look at recovering about $40 million but I would be thinking that we would be battling to do much more than that.\\" On 17 September 2010, IMF lodged a second WA Supreme Court writ on behalf of 242 Firepower investors seeking more than A$5 million from Les and Miriam Stein and their family company Sattvic; up to A$26 million from Fremantle lawyers Matthew Morgan and Stefan Alteruthemeyer and their company Maclma; and about A$8 million from the National Australia Bank. A press report cited IMF's investment manager Paul Rainford as planning a third action against a Singapore company with the goal of recovering a total of A$60 million through the three lawsuits.

Pharmacology Reports on the \\"classical\\" pharmacology of pempidine have been published. The Spinks group, at ICI, compared pempidine, its N-ethyl analogue, and mecamylamine in considerable detail, with additional data related to several structurally simpler compounds. Toxicology LD50 for the HCl salt of pempidine in mice: 74 mg/kg (i.v.); 125 mg/kg (i.p.); 413 mg/kg (p.o.). Chemistry Pempidine is an aliphatic, sterically hindered, cyclic, tertiary amine, which is a weak base: in its protonated form it has a pKa of 11.25. Pempidine is a liquid with a boiling point of 187–188 °C and a density of 0.858 g/cm3. Two early syntheses of this compound are those of Leonard and Hauck, and Hall. These are very similar in principle: Leonard and Hauck reacted phorone with ammonia, to produce 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidone,The \\"trivial\\" name of this compound is triacetonamine. which was then reduced by means of the Wolff–Kishner reduction to 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine; this secondary amine was then N-methylated using methyl iodide and potassium carbonate.The boiling point of 147 °C given by these authors for their N,2,2,6,6-pentamethylpiperidine (pempidine) is significantly below the range of ~182–188 °C reported by other chemists. Hall's method involved reacting acetone with ammonia in the presence of calcium chloride to give 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidone, which was then reduced under Wolff-Kishner conditions, followed by N-methylation of the resulting 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine with methyl p-toluenesulfonate.

Formally, :\\\\frac{\\\\partial U/\\\\partial x_i}{p_i}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial U/\\\\partial x_j}{p_j}~\\\\forall\\\\left(i,j\\\\right) where * U is utility * x_i is quantity of the i-th good or service * p_i is the price of the i-th good or service  Informal derivation  Imagine that an agent has spent money on various sorts of goods or services. If the last unit of currency spent on goods or services of one sort bought a quantity with less marginal utility than that which would have been associated with the quantity of another sort that could have been bought with the money, then the agent would have been better off instead buying more of that other good or service. Assuming that goods and services are continuously divisible, the only way that it is possible that the marginal expenditure on one good or service should not yield more utility than the marginal expenditure on the other (or vice versa) is if the marginal expenditures yield equal utility.  Formal derivation  Assume that utility, goods, and services have the requisite properties so that \\\\partial U/\\\\partial x_i is well defined for each good or service. An agent then optimizes :U\\\\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\\\\dots,x_n\\\\right) subject to a budget constraint :W\\\\geq\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\left(p_i\\\\cdot x_i \\\\right) where * W is the total available sum of money Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, one constructs the function :\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\\\\dots,x_n ,\\\\lambda\\\\right)=U\\\\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\\\\dots,x_n\\\\right)+\\\\lambda\\\\cdot\\\\left[W-\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\left(p_i\\\\cdot x_i \\\\right)\\\\right] and finds the first-order conditions for optimization as :\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial\\\\lambda}=0 (which simply implies that all of W will be spent) and :\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial x_i}=0~~\\\\forall i so that :\\\\frac{\\\\partial U}{\\\\partial x_i}-\\\\lambda\\\\cdot p_i =0~~\\\\forall i which is algebraically equivalent to :\\\\frac{\\\\partial U/\\\\partial x_i}{p_i}=\\\\lambda~~\\\\forall i Since every such ratio is equal to \\\\lambda, the ratios are all equal one to another: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial U/\\\\partial x_i}{p_i}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial U/\\\\partial x_j}{p_j}~\\\\forall\\\\left(i,j\\\\right) (Note that, as with any maximization using first-order conditions, the equations will hold only if the utility function satisfies specific concavity requirements and does not have maxima on the edges of the set over which one is maximizing.)

Personal life=Background= Wahab was born on 14 November 1956 as the eldest of four children. In 1978 she married Wahab Siddiqui, a journalist and, later, a television anchorman in political talk shows. For the next fourteen years, she was a housewife and had four children. She acted in Haseena Moin's drama serial Kohar as the cousin of the hero played by the model, Junaid Butt. The drama aired in 1991 and 1992 and was directed by M Zaheer Khan. She would consider it as her \\"favorite mistake\\". In February 1993, her husband died of a massive heart attack and her life took a new turn. She married cardiologist Athar Hussein in 1998. On 24 May 2012, she was admitted to hospital in Karachi and died on 17 June 2012.  Political career Wahab worked for the Pakistan Industrial and Commercial Leasing as a Marketing Manager between 1993 and 1996. She was nominated as Member Advisory Council of Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) in October 1994. Initially she was given charge of the Municipal Ward 59. She was also nominated as Chairman of the Information Committee of KMC. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto nominated her to become the Information Secretary of the women's wing of the PPP in Sindh, a position she held until early 2002. After the dissolution of the PPP government in November 1996, general elections were held in February 1997 in which she was nominated to contest the elections on NA-193, as a PPP candidate. The PPP lost the elections and was confined to the opposition benches in the subsequent National Assembly. With cases established against the PPP leadership, a multi- pronged strategy was initiated by the party to defend its leadership. It included contesting cases in the courts and apprising international institutions about the conduct of these cases. In 1998, Benazir Bhutto nominated Wahab to become the Central Coordinator of the Human Rights Cell with responsibility for corresponding with human rights organisations abroad. During the incarceration period of Benazir Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari, she wrote on various pressure tactics of the National Accountability Bureau and various government agencies against the couple as well as party leaders and workers. She was also an active proponent for the repealing of the Hudood Ordinance as well as the Blasphemy Law. When the 2002 Pakistani general election were called in October, she was nominated as a candidate for the reserved seats for women in the National Assembly. She took oath as a legislator and was also made part of the Standing Committee on Privatization and the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs. She was also a senior member of the Finance Committee of the National Assembly that looked after the Assembly's budget. In 2003, she attended the National Defence College course for civil leaders. She was one of the initiators of the relationship with the National Democratic Institute (NDI) and was invited to attend the \\"Win With Women – Global Initiative\\" of the Institute in December 2003. In June 2004, she was invited by the NDI to attend the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston where Senator John Kerry was nominated as the Democratic Party's candidate for president in 2004. Fauzia also represented her party on a study tour of the German Parliamentary System in 2004. With the 2005 Local Government elections taking place in August, she gained responsibility for working out an adjustment with the Jamat-e-Islami in the District East of Karachi. In September 2005, she was nominated to contest the elections of Nazim of the City District Government Karachi. However, her candidature was withdrawn in favour Naimatullah Khan. During the National Assembly of 2002 and 2007, she was an active member of the opposition involved in a number of questions, calling attention notices, adjournment motions, resolutions and motions. She was also a mover of a number of bills including a bill on the environment and a ban on polythene bags. She was nominated again for a second term by the PPP and returned to the National Assembly. She took oath as a Treasury bench member on 6 March 2008. After Information Minister Sherry Rehman resigned from her government position, the party position she held was taken away and Fauzia Wahab was appointed the Information Secretary of the PPP. By virtue of being the Information Secretary, Fauzia Wahab became an ex officio member of the Central Executive Committee of the Party. In her second term as MNA, she was elected as Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly on Finance and Revenue. This committee was the second most active parliamentary committee after the Public Accounts Committee in the number of meetings held.  Benazir Bhutto's assassination PPP Chairperson Benazir Bhutto returned to Pakistan after eight years of self-exile on 18 October 2007. A crowd of nearly 3 million people had assembled outside Karachi's Jinnah International Airport. The convoy carrying Bhutto was attacked at midnight by a suicide bomber. More than 180 citizens and party workers were killed and more than 500 were injured. Wahab was also on the truck carrying Bhutto and was injured in the explosion. On 27 December 2007, Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in a gun and suicide bomb attack. Fauzia Wahab was one of the first leaders to reach the Bilawal House in Karachi and arranged for transportation of leaders and workers from Karachi to Garhi Khuda Bux for the funeral. She also received condolences from MQM Chief Altaf Hussain and various leaders on her assassination. Raymond Davis controversy Wahab created a minor media controversy with her comments on Raymond Davis, a US citizen convicted of killing two men. Her comments on the outgoing Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, who allegedly resigned for his support of the judicial process for the Raymond Davis case in refusing to accept US pressure to grant him diplomatic status, landed her in further trouble with the PPP leadership and the media.  Death  Wahab was admitted to a local hospital for an elective gall bladder surgery on 24 May 2012. Her condition due to post operative complications worsened and she was moved to the ICU and had two subsequent surgeries. She died on Sunday, 17 June 2012. The Pakistan Peoples Party announced ten days of mourning for her death. Most Pakistani politicians expressed grief, including President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani. Her funeral prayer occurred after Zuhr prayers at Sultan Masjid, in the Defence area of Karachi, and was attended by Chief Minister Syed Qaim Ali Shah, Advisor to the Prime Minister on Interior Affairs, Rehman Malik, and other provincial and federal ministers.  Honors and awards  Her sudden death was a shock to majority of the political class and media of Pakistan. A session of the National Assembly on 6 July 2012 was dedicated to her memory in which members belonging to all parties in the parliament paid glowing tributes to her. The session was adjourned after praying for her departed soul. Prominent among those who spoke included Prime Minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, Makhdoom Amin Fahim, Aftab Sherpao, Bushra Gohar, Khwaja Saad Rafique, Hamid Saeed Kazmi and Abdul Qadir Patel. Abdul Qadir Patel requested the Speaker to form a parliamentary committee to ascertain facts if any negligence of doctors caused her death. He said that she lost her life due to a minor and ordinary operation conducted in an expensive private hospital. On 14 August 2012, the president of Pakistan honoured her with a posthumous Hilal-e-Imtiaz award for her services to democracy and parliament. Senior Journalist, Mujahid Barelvi has compiled a book eulogising Fauzia Wahab titled as \\"Muskurahat Zinda Rehti Hay\\" or \\"A Smile Never Dies\\". The book was launched at the Karachi Press Club on 10 November 2012 which was widely attended by a large number of political leaders belonging to PPP, MQM, Jamat-e-Islami, PML-N and PTI as well party workers, friends and well wishers.

Biography Nahum Shahaf earned a Master of Physics degree from Bar-Ilan University in 1977. Throughout most the 1980s, he worked on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which Israeli journalist Amnon Lord described as placing Shahaf \\"among the leading developers\\" of the technology. According to his curriculum vitae, Shahaf worked primarily on UAV optical tracking systems, before shifting his focus to missile systems and inventing over the next decade. In 1997, he received an Israeli Ministry of Science award for creativity for his work on compressed digital video transmission. Al-Durrah investigation Muhammad al-Durrah was a 12-year-old Palestinian boy, reported to have been shot and killed by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) gunfire on September 30, 2000. Shahaf, noticing what he considered an anomaly in the video footage of the shooting, contacted Major General Yom Tov Samia, head of the Israel's Southern Command. Shahaf proposed that he and Joseph Doriel, an engineer Shahaf had previously collaborated with on conspiracy theories surrounding the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, should investigate the incident. Samia agreed, and on October 23, 2000, Shahaf helped arrange a re-enactment at an IDF shooting range, in front of a CBS 60 Minutes camera crew. In late November 2000, the investigators concluded, based on the angles and rate of fire, that Israeli troops had probably not shot the boy. Israeli newspapers Haaretz and the Jerusalem Post claimed that Shahaf had no ballistics experience and Haaretz described the investigation as \\"dubious.\\" His previous involvement in raising doubts about the identity of Rabin's killer became the subject of controversy. Shahaf, however, spent months painstakingly collecting footage from reluctant cameramen and splicing the pieces together in rough temporal order to create an unbroken film of the day. Shahaf believes that al-Durrah was not killed by the IDF and may still be alive. In December 2007, following Haaretz's report on his work, which op-ed writer Gideon Levy described as an \\"eccentric obsession,\\" Shahaf filed a defamation lawsuit against the newspaper charging that Haaretz's coverage had caused investors to back out of financing one of his inventions. He filed for 400 million shekels (US $103 million) in damages.

Yotvingia or Sudovia (Sudovian: Sūdawa, , , , Eastern Slavic: Яцьвезь (Ятвязь, Етвязь), Ятвягия)) was a region where the Baltic tribe known as Yotvingians lived. It was located in the area of Sudovia and Dainava; south west from the upper Nemunas, between Marijampolė, Merkinė (Lithuania), Slonim, Kobryn (Belarus), Białystok, and Ełk (Poland). Today this area corresponds mostly to the Podlaskie Voivodeship of Poland, part of Lithuania and a part of Hrodna Province and Brest Province of Belarus. History The Treaty of 944 between Kievan prince Igor and the Byzantine Empire has the names of many Rus' ambassadors - one of which was Jatviag Gunarev. It is also the first written documentation of the term Jatviag, or Yatviag. The southern part of the Yotvingian lands, Sudovia and Galindia, were subdued by Kievan Rus' army, led by Vladimir I of Kiev in 983. Netimeras, a ruler of the Yotvingians, was converted to Christianity by Bruno of Querfurt in 1009. When his father died in 1170, Roman the Great was bequeathed the Principality of Vladimir-in-Volhynia. He subdued the Yatvingians, and harnessed the captives instead of oxen to drag the plows on his estates. From the 13th century, Yotvingians began raiding adjacent areas of Masovia, Lublin and Volhynia, after Konrad I of Masovia and Daniel of Halych had invaded them. In 1264, the Duke of Krakow, Boleslaw V the Chaste organized an expedition against Yotvingia. On 23 June 1264 the two armies met near Brańsk. The Battle of Brańsk lasted two days pitting the forces of Yotvingia, led by Komata (Kumata) against the well equipped Krakovian army. The Yotvingian forces were routed in a bloody battle and Komata was killed. In the 1280s the Northern Yotvingians were partly conquered and dispersed by the Teutonic Knights; some Yotvingians then took refuge in the Duchy of Lithuania. On 27 September 1422, the Treaty of Melno ended the Gollub War. The Treaty divided Yotvingia between the Teutonic Knights, the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

No. 180643) is a controversial 9-6 ruling of the Supreme Court of the Philippines which affirmed the invocation of executive privilege by petitioner Romulo Neri, member of the Cabinet of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, regarding questions asked during a Congressional inquiry on the controversial multimillion-dollar National Broadband Network (NBN) Project. The Supreme Court finally affirmed this ruling on September 4 and 23, 2008 by denying the defendant Senate Committees' first and second Motions for Reconsideration.  The facts and the Court's ruling  Petitioner Romulo Neri, then Director General of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), was invited by the respondent Senate Committees to attend their joint investigation on the alleged anomalies in the National Broadband Network (NBN) Project. This project was contracted by the Philippine Government with the Chinese firm Zhong Xing Telecommunications Equipment (ZTE), which involved the amount of US$329,481,290. When he testified before the Senate Committees, he disclosed that then Commission on Elections Chairman Benjamin Abalos, brokering for ZTE, offered him P200 million in exchange for his approval of the NBN Project. He further narrated that he informed President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo about the bribery attempt and that she instructed him not to accept the bribe. However, when probed further on what they discussed about the NBN Project, petitioner refused to answer, invoking \\"executive privilege.\\" In particular, he refused to answer the questions on 1.) whether or not the President followed up the NBN Project, 2.) whether or not she directed him to prioritize it, and 3.) whether or not she directed him to approve it. Later on, respondent Committees issued a Subpoena Ad Testificandum to petitioner, requiring him to appear and testify on 20 November 2007. However, Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita sent a letter dated 15 November to the Committees requesting them to dispense with Neri's testimony on the ground of executive privilege. Ermita invoked the privilege on the ground that \\"the information sought to be disclosed might impair our diplomatic as well as economic relations with the People’s Republic of China,\\" and given the confidential nature in which these information were conveyed to the President, Neri \\"cannot provide the Committee any further details of these conversations, without disclosing the very thing the privilege is designed to protect.\\" Thus, on 20 November, Neri did not appear before the respondent Committees. On 22 November, respondents issued a Show Cause Letter to Neri requiring him to show cause why he should not be cited for contempt for his failure to attend the scheduled hearing on 20 November. On 29 November, Neri replied to the Show Cause Letter and explained that he did not intend to snub the Senate hearing, and requested that if there be new matters that were not yet taken up during his first appearance, he be informed in advance so he can prepare himself. He added that his non-appearance was upon the order of the President, and that his conversation with her dealt with delicate and sensitive national security and diplomatic matters relating to the impact of the bribery scandal involving high government officials and the possible loss of confidence of foreign investors and lenders in the Philippines. Respondents found the explanation unsatisfactory, and later on issued an Order citing Neri in contempt and consequently ordering his arrest and detention at the Office of the Senate Sergeant-At-Arms until he appears and gives his testimony. =Filing of the petition= Neri filed this present petition asking the Court to nullify both the Show Cause Letter and the Contempt Order for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and stressed that his refusal to answer the three questions was anchored on a valid claim to executive privilege in accordance with the ruling in the landmark case of Senate v. Ermita (G.R. No. 169777, 20 April 2006). For its part, the Senate Committees argued that they did not exceed their authority in issuing the assailed orders because there is no valid justification for Neri's claim to executive privilege. In addition, they claimed that the refusal of petitioner to answer the three questions violates the people’s right to public information, and that the executive is using the concept of executive privilege as a means to conceal the criminal act of bribery in the highest levels of government. =The main issue and the Court's ruling= The main substantial issue sought to be resolved in the case was whether the three questions that petitioner Neri refused to answer were covered by executive privilege, making the arrest order issued by the respondent Senate Committees void. The divided Supreme Court (voting 9-6) was convinced that the three questions are covered by presidential communications privilege, and that this privilege has been validly claimed by the executive department, enough to shield petitioner Neri from any arrest order the Senate may issue against him for not answering such questions.  Validity of claim to executive privilege  Citing the case of United States v. Nixon (418 U.S. 683), the Court laid out the three elements needed to be complied with in order for the claim to executive privilege to be valid. These are: 1.) the protected communication must relate to a quintessential and non-delegable presidential power; 2.) it must be authored, solicited, and received by a close advisor of the President or the President himself. The judicial test is that an advisor must be in \\"operational proximity\\" with the President; and, 3.) it may be overcome by a showing of adequate need, such that the information sought \\"likely contains important evidence,\\" and by the unavailability of the information elsewhere by an appropriate investigating authority. Anent the first element, executive privilege may be validly claimed by the executive department only in cases where the power subject of the legislative inquiry is expressly granted by the Constitution to the President. Such powers include the commander-in-chief, appointing, pardoning, and diplomatic powers. In light of the doctrine of separation of powers, the said powers of the President enjoy a greater degree of confidentiality than other presidential powers. In the present case, Executive Secretary Ermita claimed executive privilege on the argument that the communications elicited by the three questions \\"fall under conversation and correspondence between the President and public officials\\" necessary in \\"her executive and policy decision-making process,\\" and that \\"the information sought to be disclosed might impair our diplomatic as well as economic relations with the People’s Republic of China.\\" It is clear then that the basis of the claim is a matter related to the quintessential and non-delegable presidential power of diplomacy or foreign relations. As to the second element, the communications were received by a close advisor of the President. Under the \\"operational proximity\\" test, petitioner Neri can be considered a close advisor, being a member of the President's Cabinet. And as to the third element, there is no adequate showing of a compelling need that would justify the limitation of the privilege and of the unavailability of the information elsewhere by an appropriate investigating authority. Presidential communications are presumptively privileged and that the presumption can be overcome only by mere showing of public need by the branch seeking access to such conversations. In the present case, respondent Committees failed to show a compelling or critical need for the answers to the three questions in the enactment of any law under Sec. 21, Art. VI. Instead, the questions veer more towards the exercise of the legislative oversight function under Sec. 22, Art. VI. As ruled in Senate v. Ermita, \\"the oversight function of Congress may be facilitated by compulsory process only to the extent that it is performed in pursuit of legislation.\\"  Compulsory process and Congress' oversight function  In determining whether Congress correctly ordered Neri's arrest for his refusal to answer the three questions, a distinction must be first laid down between Sections 21 and 22, Article VI of the Philippine Constitution. Sec. 21 relates to the power to conduct inquiries in aid of legislation. Its aim is to elicit information that may be used for the enactment of laws. On the other hand, Sec. 22 pertains to the power to conduct a question hour, the objective of which is to obtain information in pursuit of Congress' oversight function over the executive department. Compulsory process is available in Congress' exercise of its powers under Sec. 21. In Sec. 22, it is NOT. Senate v. Ermita is clear: \\"When Congress merely seeks to be informed on how department heads are implementing the statutes which it has issued, its right to such information is not as imperative as that of the President to whom, as Chief Executive, such department heads must give a report of their performance as a matter of duty. In such instances, Section 22, in keeping with the separation of powers, states that Congress may only request their appearance. Nonetheless, when the inquiry in which Congress requires their appearance is ‘in aid of legislation’ under Section 21, the appearance is mandatory.\\"  Use of executive privilege in concealing a crime  Respondent Committees argue that a claim of executive privilege does not guard against a possible disclosure of a crime or wrongdoing. The Court does not contest this. It has been settled that the specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial outweighs the President’s generalized interest in confidentiality. However, the present case DOES NOT INVOLVE A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING where the information sought from Neri would help in meeting the demands of fair administration of criminal justice. Instead, the present controversy arose from a legislative inquiry. There is a clear difference between Congress' legislative tasks and the responsibility of a criminal court. While fact- finding by a legislative committee is undeniably a part of its task, legislative judgments normally depend more on the predicted consequences of proposed legislative actions and their political acceptability, than on precise reconstruction of past events; Congress frequently legislates on the basis of conflicting information provided in its hearings. In contrast, the responsibility of the criminal court turns entirely on its ability to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that certain named individuals did or did not commit specific crimes.  Executive privilege and the people's right to information  Petitioner Neri appeared before the respondent Committees and answered all of their questions except the three where he claimed executive privilege. Nevertheless, his refusal to answer based on the claim of executive privilege does not violate the people's right to information on matters of public concern simply because Sec. 7, Art. III of the Constitution itself provides that this right is \\"subject to such limitations as may be provided by law.\\" As correctly pleaded by Neri, he is precluded from divulging the answers to the three questions by Sec. 7 of R.A. 6713, Article 229 of the Revised Penal Code, Sec. 3(k) of R.A. 3019, and Section 24(e), Rule 130 of the Rules of Court. These are in addition to the larger concept of executive privilege, which recognizes the public interest in the confidentiality of certain information.  Right of Congress to information and the right to public information  In addition, respondent Committees have a wrong understanding of the people's right to public information. The right of Congress or any of its Committees to obtain information in aid of legislation cannot be equated with the people’s right to public information. As laid down in Senate v. Ermita, \\"the demand of a citizen for the production of documents pursuant to his right to information does not have the same obligatory force as a subpoena duces tecum issued by Congress. Neither does the right to information grant a citizen the power to exact testimony from government officials. These powers belong only to Congress, not to an individual citizen.\\" Even if Congress is composed of representatives elected by the people, it does not follow, except in a highly qualified sense, that in every exercise of its power of inquiry, the people are exercising their right to information. The members of respondent Committees should not invoke as justification in their exercise of power a right properly belonging to the people in general. This is because when they discharge their power, they do so as public officials and members of Congress.  Abuse of discretion in ordering Neri's arrest  In fine, the Court gave five reasons for ruling that respondents exceeded their authority in issuing the assailed orders: 1.) There being a legitimate claim of executive privilege, the issuance of the contempt Order is void. 2.) Respondents did not comply with the requirement laid down in Senate v. Ermita that the invitations should contain the \\"possible needed statute which prompted the need for the inquiry,\\" along with \\"the usual indication of the subject of inquiry and the questions relative to and in furtherance thereof,\\" as required in Sec. 21 and 22, Art. VI of the Constitution. 3.) Only a minority of the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee was present during the deliberation for the issuance of the contempt Order. This is in violation of Sec. 18 of the Rules of Procedure Governing Inquiries in Aid of Legislation, which provides that \\"the Committee, by a vote of majority of all its members, may punish for contempt any witness before it who disobeys any order of the Committee or refuses to be sworn or to testify or to answer proper questions by the Committee or any of its members.\\" 4.) Respondents violated Sec. 21, Art. VI of the Philippine Constitution, requiring that the inquiry be in accordance with the \\"duly published rules of procedure.\\" This requires the Senate of every Congress to publish its rules of procedure governing inquiries in aid of legislation because every Senate is distinct from the one before it or after it. Since Senatorial elections are held every three years for one-half of the Senate’s membership, the composition of the Senate also changes by the end of each term. Each Senate may thus enact a different set of rules as it may deem fit. Not having published its Rules of Procedure, the subject hearings in aid of legislation conducted by the 14th Senate are therefore procedurally infirm. 5.) The issuance of the contempt Order is arbitrary and precipitate. The respondent Committees did not first pass upon the claim of executive privilege and inform petitioner of their ruling. Instead, they dismissed his explanation as \\"unsatisfactory\\" and simultaneously issued the Order citing him in contempt and ordering his immediate arrest and detention, even if he has expressed his desire to appear before them to answer other questions except those covered by executive privilege.  Doctrines laid down  1.) Compulsory process in legislative proceedings can only be exercised by Congress in inquiries in aid of legislation under Sec. 21 Art. VI, and not in the exercise of its oversight function under Sec. 22 Art. VI. 2.) Executive privilege cannot be used to conceal a crime or a possible wrongdoing. Thus, the specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial outweighs the President’s generalized interest in confidentiality. However, there is a difference between a criminal investigation and a legislative inquiry, and the presumption in favor of confidentiality precedes the right to demand information if the information is elicited in legislative inquiries and not in criminal investigations. 3.) The right of Congress or any of its Committees to obtain information in aid of legislation cannot be equated with the people’s right to public information. The demand of a citizen for the production of documents pursuant to his right to information does not have the same obligatory force as a subpoena duces tecum issued by Congress. In the exercise of its power, Congress cannot invoke a right properly belonging to the people in general. This is because when they discharge their power, they do so as public officials and members of Congress.  See also  *NBN–ZTE deal corruption scandal  External links  *Full text of Neri v.

Based on a story by David Butler, the film is about a construction worker who takes charge of the daughter of a friend killed in an accident. Filming took place in Hollywood between February and April 1940. This was another independent production for Crosby outside his Paramount contract and he took a financial interest in it. The film had its New York premiere at the Rivoli Theater on May 5, 1940. Plot Buzz Blackwell, Fred Johnson and Axel Swenson are construction workers in San Francisco who are helping to build the Golden Gate Bridge. They are good friends and Buzz and Axel even help Fred in raising his daughter Patricia. When Fred tragically dies in an accident, Patricia is forced to go live with her relatives in New York City whom she has never met. Buzz and Axel decide to travel with her. They soon arrive at the home of her uncle Jarvis Johnson, a snobby rich man with supercilious wife. Jarvis has received a letter from Buzz but wants no part in raising Patricia. When they show up, Jarvis pretends to be someone else and sends them to the other \\"J. Johnson\\", Joe, another uncle. Joe and Marian are poor ex-vaudevillans but welcome the girl with open arms. Buzz wants to give Joe the money Fred left for Patricia, but finds out a drunken Axel used that money to buy a Swedish restaurant. Buzz is determined to help and turns the restaurant into a nightclub, using a loan from Jarvis, which he obtained through false pretenses. Jarvis returns to claim his money back, but the club is a success and he is repaid.

White House) is a historic building located at 10292 Donner Pass Road, in Truckee, Nevada County, northern California. The mansion was built in 1873/1874 by W. H. Kruger, who was then a partner in the Truckee Lumber Company. It was originally designed as a single family residence, in the Queen Anne Eastlake Victorian style. It served as a hotel in the early 20th century. The restored building currently houses a restaurant and specialty store, in the Brickelltown neighborhood west of downtown Truckee.1850-1874, 1875–1899, 1900-1924 were periods of significance for the historic building. In 1982 it was registered with the California Office of Historic Preservation, and added to the National Register of Historic Places. History=Kruger family= The mansion was built by William Henry Kruger for his wife and eventual six children. It is reported that Mr. Kruger 'imported' fourteen Austrian craftsmen for the project. Henry Kruger was born in Germany April 9, 1830, and came to America in 1852. While engaged in mining, mercantile pursuits and the sawmill business, he lived in Grass Valley, Dutch Flat, and finally Truckee, where he became half-owner of the very large and successful Truckee Lumber Company with E. J. Brickell (the namesake of that part of town). His partnership with Mr. Brickell involved one of the most efficient and progressive mills in the area, in addition to a supply house offering the latest and best materials available for construction, decorating and furnishing for the most discriminating customers. Henry Kruger died June 27, 1891, leaving his fortune, which by then had grown to an estimated million 1891 dollars, to his wife and children. Mary Adella Richardson Kruger lived until the age of 93, dying November 3, 1940. Nearly all of Kruger's surviving grand, great-grand and great-great-grandchildren are living in California today. =White family= Charles Bernard White, a Bank of America executive and prominent Truckee citizen, purchased the home in November 1904 for his wife Belle and infant son C. B. White, Junior. Belle White, in her youth, was a Sacramento Beauty Queen, and also a noted concert pianist, offering instruction in their home for many decades. The Truckee old- timers still speak of the massive piano and other exquisite furnishings that adorned the 'White House.' He was later deeply involved in the Lincoln Highway through Truckee Project. Barney White Jr. later attended the University of California, Berkeley, becoming a well-regarded Sacramento civil engineer, and was a long-time leader of the Sacramento Banjo-Players' Association. It was during the early 1900s that the White family opened their home to help alleviate the local lodging shortage: from 1912 to the late twenties, the 'White House Hotel' catered to the first automobile traffic over Donner Pass Summit, which included many notable early Lake Tahoe residents and preservationists; for instance D. L. Bliss, his and numerous signatures of other wealthy and famous can be found in the original White House Hotel Register, beginning July 1912. After the late 1920s, the home returned to use as a single family residence. It eventually suffered a period of vacancy and deterioration through the mid 20th century. =Krakowsky Restoration= Under the direction of Zena Krakowsky, a long-time Truckee resident and progressive businessperson, the mansion underwent an extensive and painstakingly precise seven-year rehabilitation, with attention being paid to every detail, including closely matching the Axminster carpet, wallpaper to reflect the originals, and custom-mixed paints to tie the interior architecture together. All parts were refurbished, including molding, fretwork and stained-glass windows.This information was contributed by Zena Krakowsky, who owned/researched/rehabilitated/operated businesses in the Kruger-White House from 1973 to 1995. (\\"To verify information, please call 831-247-7733.\\") During the project, the building was transparently upgraded to commercial code in preparation for Ms. Krakowsky's opening the building to the public in 1980 as an antique shop and fine-dining establishment. In 1982, based on the quality of rehabilitation and preservation, the Kruger-White House received the honor of being the first property in the area to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places. On 17 June 1982, it was registered with the California Office of Historic Preservation, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places (#82002220). She operated businesses in the Kruger-White House from 1973 to 1995. After the home was rehabilitated, the original 'White House Hotel Sign,' the hotel register (July 1912—forward), and other historic items discovered in the basement during rehabilitation were donated to the Truckee- Donner Historical Society.1850—1874, 1875—1899, 1900—1924 were periods of significant historic events for the building. BIGELOW/THAYER -- SAVING THE BUILDING FROM DECAY In 2015 Tanya Thayer and Aaron Bigelow purchased the CB White House. The White House was in extremely poor condition, and rotting literally in to the ground, as was the historic adjacent building the old Carriage House. After decades and decades of little to no maintenance and extreme neglect the buildings had begun to rot and collapse. With extensive experience in historic building repair, refurbishment and restoration of pre-1900 built structures, Aaron Bigelow of Bigelow Construction began the pain-staking and challenging task of saving this piece of Truckee History. The goal was to restore as much as could be restored to the original. Utilizing old photographs and with the help of the Truckee Historic Society Bigelow/Thayer began this daunting task. In the Town of Truckee the building is zoned and categorized as one of if not the most important historic structure in the Town. It is the oldest still standing original location mansion/home, and one of the least modified structures from original in the Town of Truckee. The Town of Truckee is now an incorporated area with a Town Council and a Historic Preservation Advisory Committee ( HPAC ) that offers advise and opinions on proposed changes and restoration methods. This began in 1993 the Town Incorporation and the advent of the HPAC board. Prior to this most buildings of historical value had no protections and many were snatched up by developers and heavily modified if not completely demolished to build something in its place with no regard to preservation and no agency to stop them. The White House narrowly survived this fate and now sits with protections. However, those protections as well intentioned as they may be, come with variations of opinions and advisory boards that do not always agree with the ultimate goal and efforts in preservation methods. So the task began, and administratively had many hurdles and challenges. After a few years of planning, meetings, negotiating and diligence, the project was given the green light to go! And thus the major renovation and restoration began. Every attention to detail was carefully planned to remove, restore and replace architecture features to exact as is / as was conditions. With the benefit of modern construction materials and practices a better built better engineered building was achieved - while still keeping with the original architecture moldings and trim details to hide its inner skeleton of modern construction materials. Regardless of the investment no expense was spared in making sure the historic home was refurbished the right way and the way in which it will last for another 140 years. The Bigelow/Thayer goal was not to invest and walk away with monetary gains - rather to purchase and steward the historic structure for generations to come to enjoy this very rare and very quickly disappearing piece of old Truckee History. One cannot walk by without stopping and looking at the White House for a moment or two - and think back to the time when she was a young home and a center piece of a booming lumber, ice, and railroad town. Imagining the era with hard working men and women in this Alpine frontier. Horse and buggy was the mode of travel, and the telegraph was the era's only way to hear of the outside worlds events. How many things in history the Historic structure has lived through. Many generations of events and change. To stand and think of this is truly humbling and a bit romantic. The Bigelow/Thayer team are very pleased to be blessed with the opportunity to step up and make this small investment in to a vital part of Truckee's and California's historical preservation. We hope that anyone who has a chance to stop by and see this amazing part of living history will take a moment and walk around the property and buildings and imagine with us a time long gone but not forgotten.

Benedek, an Israeli mathematician. The goal of Hidato is to fill the grid with consecutive numbers that connect horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The name Hidato is a registered trademark of Doo-Bee Toys and Games LTD, a company co-founded by Benebek himself. Some publishers use different names for this puzzle such as Number Snake, Snakepit (both of which play on the game's similarity in concept to the video game Snake), Jadium or Numbrix. About the puzzle In Hidato, a grid of cells is given. It is usually square-shaped, like Sudoku or Kakuro, but it can also include hexagons or any shape that forms a tessellation. It can have inner holes (like a disc), but it has to be made of only one piece. The goal is to fill the grid with a series of consecutive numbers adjacent to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. In every Hidato puzzle the smallest and the highest numbers are given on the grid. There are also other given numbers on the grid (with values between the smallest and the highest) to help direct the player how to start the solution and to ensure that Hidato has a single solution. Note: the above condition on the smallest or highest numbers are sometimes relaxed: only their values can be given, without their positions on the grid (of course, the difference between these values must be equal to the number of cells in the grid minus one). This may lead to harder puzzles. Every well-formed Hidato puzzle is supposed to have a unique solution. Moreover, a Hidato puzzle intended for human solvers should have a solution that can be found by (more or less) simple logic. However, there exist very hard Hidato puzzles, even of small size. Distribution Hidato puzzles are published in newspapers such as the Daily Mail After Hidato publication,Numbrix puzzles, created by Marilyn vos Savant and appearing in most editions of the weekly magazine Parade, are similar to Hidato except that diagonal moves are not allowed and that all puzzles are square in shape (vos Savant has only used 7×7 and 9×9 grids). Jadium puzzles (formerly Snakepit puzzles), created by Jeff Marchant, are a more difficult version of Numbrix with fewer given numbers and have appeared on the Parade web site regularly since 2014, along with a daily online version of Numbrix. Solving techniques As in many logic puzzles, the basic resolution technique consists of analyzing the possibilities for each number of being present in each cell. When a cell can contain only one number (Naked Single) or when a number has only one possible place (Hidden Single), it can be asserted as belonging to the solution. One key to the solution is, it does not have to be built in ascending (or descending) order; it can be built piecewise, with pieces starting from different givens. As in the Sudoku case, the resolution of harder Hidato or Numbrix puzzles requires the use of more complex techniques - in particular of various types of chain patterns.

The band has released one EP and five studio albums. History=Formation and Rep Your Hood (2007–2008)= Deez Nuts is a band that started after the disbanding of Australian metalcore band I Killed the Prom Queen, of which JJ Peters was the drummer. After being heavily influenced by the hip hop and hardcore punk styles of music, Peters decided to start Deez Nuts. After he wrote a few songs he entered the studio to record the 2007 Deez Nuts (band) demo performing all instruments and vocals. On the 2007 Deez Nuts demo, all instruments and vocals were performed by JJ Peters, the band's founder. Acquiring live members, Peters and the band played a few shows around Melbourne, and after such a positive response, Peters entered the studio again to finish recording Deez Nuts' first public release, an EP titled, Rep Your Hood which was also recorded with Peters performing everything. Shortly after the release, Deez Nuts embarked on their first tour of Australia during October 2007, the infamous Drunk and Disorderly Tour, with friends The Amity Affliction and the Daylight Curse. =Stay True (2008–2010)= After a short break, the band then set out on an Australian Boys of Summer Tour in January 2008 with Silverstein, alongside Set Your Goals, the Amity Affliction and Capeside. The tour was a huge success for the band, who were growing bigger within the Australian Hardcore Community. Shortly after the Boys of Summer Tour, Peters began writing the next release for the band. Peters placed Deez Nuts (band) on hold for the months of May and June 2008, to focus on his commitment to the I Killed the Prom Queen farewell tour. I Killed the Prom Queen's Say Goodbye Tour took place in May and June 2008, with most shows selling out almost immediately. The supporting acts for the tour were Bring Me the Horizon, the Red Shore, the Ghost Inside and a local act from each city played at. After the tour, Peters continued writing for the debut album of Deez Nuts. The Deez Nuts debut album was recorded by Roman Koester of the Red Shore at Complex Studios in August 2008. After the recording process, Deez Nuts embarked on a tour of Australia in September 2008, joined by I Killed the Prom Queen alumni Michael Crafter's new band Confession. Then in October, Deez Nuts was invited to tour Europe with English deathcore act Bring Me the Horizon along with friends the Red Shore and Ignominious Incarceration. During this tour of Europe, Deez Nuts' first album, Stay True, was released on 4 October 2008, in Australia by Stomp Entertainment. Once returning from Europe, Deez Nuts began planning a National Australian tour in support of Stay True'. The Stay True Tour took place from January to February 2009, supported by hip hop artist Louie Knuxx. After a string of Australian shows, Deez Nuts returned to Europe to tour with English hardcore band Your Demise. During this tour, Deez Nuts organised a few headline shows in England, which received positive reviews and crowd reaction. The band immediately headed to the U.S. for a tour with American hardcore act Ligeia. Upon arrival in the country, the band was denied entry as a result of misinformation with their paperwork, and were sent back to Australia. During the time in between tours Peters spent back in Australia, he formed a hip hop/rap group called Grips & Tonic with New Zealand rapper Louie Knuxx. The group released a full-length album, Want Some, Get Some, which was released in June 2008. In June and July 2008, Deez Nuts toured Australia again on the second Drunk and Disorderly Tour with The Amity Affliction, this time playing much larger venues than the last tour, mainly because both bands had gained a larger fanbase because of recent album releases. At the after parties for the tour, Peters' new group Grips & Tonic played a string of shows, which received positive reviews. In September 2008, Deez Nuts headlined the Australian Sike Your Mind tour, playing alongside Miles Away, Antagonist A.D., and in Trenches and Blkout. In October 2008, Deez Nuts returned to Europe with Swedish band Raised Fist, and returned to the Australian live scene in December on the Schools Out for Summer Tour with American band The Ghost Inside, Australian bands Mark My Words and Mourning Tide, and Peters' Grips & Tonic project. =This One's for You and Bout It! (2010–present)= Deez Nuts released their second studio album, This One's for You, on 21 May 2010 (in Australia). It was recorded by Roman Koester of the Red Shore at Complex Studios in April 2010, and frontman Peters stated that it only took him two weeks to write. The album features appearances by several guest vocalists, including Oli Sykes of Bring Me the Horizon on the song \\"If You Don't Know Now You Know\\". This One's for You was followed by Deez Nuts' third album, Bout It!, which was released in March 2013. Bout It! features guest appearances from a number of musicians and was produced by Shane Frisby (The Ghost Inside). It consists of 16 tracks, including the singles \\"Band of Brothers\\" and \\"Shot After Shot\\". In the Fall of 2011, Deez Nuts went to the United States to open up for Bring Me the Horizon. Parkway Drive, Architects, On Broken Wings and of Legends all played on the tour. In March 2014, bassist Jon Green decided to leave Deez Nuts to focus on his personal life. He was replaced by Sean Kennedy, who is one of the original members of the band as well as a long time member of I Killed the Prom Queen alongside JJ Peters. Deez Nuts next album, \\"Word is Bond\\" was released in 2015. Deez Nuts returned to the United States in the Fall of 2015, supporting Stray from the Path and Comeback Kid on The Subliminal Criminals Tour. Being as an Ocean and Major League also joined up on the lineup. In 2017, Deez Nuts released their next album called Binge & Purgatory. Deez Nuts returned to the United States in the Summer of 2018, playing on the entire Vans Warped Tour.

Jesolo or Iesolo (; ) is a seaside resort town and comune in the Metropolitan City of Venice, Italy of 26,776 inhabitants. With around six million visitors per year, Jesolo is one of the largest beach resorts in the country, and ranks 7th overall as a tourist destination, and fourth (behind Rimini, Cavallino-Treporti, San Michele al Tagliamento/Bibione) most popular Italian seaside resort. With 204,711.4 visits per thousand inhabitants, it is also one of the 50 Italian towns with the greatest tourist pressure. Its 15 kilometre long beaches and proximity to central Europe make it a favourite destination of many German, Austrian, Dutch and French visitors. Geography The town lies north of Venice, between Eraclea and Cavallino-Treporti. Jesolo gives its name to a lagoon of on the Adriatic Sea between the rivers Sile and Piave. The urbanized area lies on an island of sorts, delimited by the rivers Piave (on the east) and Sile (on the west), and an artificial canal called Cavetta, which starts from the center of Jesolo and goes towards Cortellazzo. The Jesolo area stretches along the Venetian coast on a flat landscape overlooking the Adriatic Sea and edged by Jesolo’s own lagoon (22 km), and by the rivers Sile and Po. This latter is edged by the opposite Laguna del Mort. The valley of Dragojesolo together with that of Grassabò,is the largest in the northern lagoon of Venice. The coastal strip is low and sandy, consisting of an uninterrupted beach about 12 kilometres long and varying in thickness between 30 and 100 metres. History In Roman times the lagoon extended over the area now occupied by the town. There were several islands in the lagoon, the biggest of which was known as , the place of horses. It is thought that Jesolo represents a corruption of this name.  Origin of the Name  The ancient name of Jesolo was Equilium (from the Latin equos or from Venetian ekvo) which means \\"town of horses.\\" The name refers to the breeding of horses, for which the ancient Venetians were famous. The current name of Jesolo probably comes from a series of transcription errors of the oldest name (Equilo, Esulo, Lesulo, Jexulo, Jexollo, Jesolum, Giesolo). From the 16th century until 1930, Jesolo was called Cavazzuccherina. This name came from the canal of the same name (in Venetian Cava), opened on 20 April and built by Alvise Zucharin (Zuccherina) The official spelling used by the municipality is Jesolo but in the same time, the spelling Iesolo is also erroneously used. Economy The city's economy is mostly based on tourism. Jesolo is a seaside resort with abundant holiday facilities and its beach called Lido di Jesolo. At the height of its touristic life, Jesolo was hosting 6 million tourists per year. Currently these have dropped to around 4.5 million tourists per year due to the competition from new resort towns.

Crain (March 15, 1914 - December 13, 1984) served as mayor of Compton, California during a period of enormous transition. Biography Chester Russell Crain was a native of Des Moines, Iowa. He was the third of at least nine children born to Carl R. and Lillie (Smith) Crain. In the 1920s, the family moved to California and settled in the Signal Hill area. He was employed as track and field coach and a professor of English at Compton Community College. In 1953, Crain was elected to the Compton City Council, representing the 2nd District. He became the city's mayor after the resignation of Congressman-elect Del Clawson in 1963. He served as mayor of Compton, California during a tumultuous period in the city's history. Unlike some of his predecessors that were uncomfortable with the town's growing black population, Crain attempted to build bridges and make Compton a model of integration. However, just a few months after his re-election in 1965, the Watts Riots broke out in the adjacent community in Los Angeles. He was an outspoken critic of Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty and accused him of neglecting the predominantly African American community. He was once quoted as saying, \\"Has he ever been to Watts?\\" In the wake of the riots many of the remaining whites left Compton and moved to new suburbs in nearby Los Angeles County communities such as Lakewood or to Orange County, a few miles south of Compton. During his tenure, Compton's city council became majority African American. In 1969, he did not seek re-election and watched as City Councilman Douglas F. Dollarhide became the city's first black chief executive. By that time, the population of Compton was roughly 65% black. After leaving office, Crain moved to the northern part of the state. He died in the Fresno, California area at the age of 70. He was living in Tulare County at the time of his death.

While looking like international sports cars the vehicles themselves are smaller and lighter. Engines are liquid-cooled, four stroke, naturally aspirated engines. They can be sourced from motorcycles with a limit of 1100 cubic centimetres, or from cars with a limit of 1630 cubic centimetres. Cockpit dimensions must have space for two seats. The category superseded the previous small sports car category, Clubman Sports 1300 (which was limited to 1300cc car engined vehicles) in 2003. The increasing popularity internationally of motorcycle powered small sports cars like those built by Radical and others brought on the change, which also sought to modernise the category. The requirement for a two seat cockpit has seen several, mostly American sports cars, like those built by West Race Cars excluded from Supersports. Supersports raced competitively at state level in New South Wales, racing with state level Australian Formula 2 cars, as well as cars appearing in most eastern states. Up until 2010 the most prominent title for the class was the Supersports Interstate Challenge, a title first awarded to the Sports 1300 class in 1979. The most recent title was won by Stephen Morcombe driving a Chiron. In 2010 a new national series began for Supersports and invited cars (to allow single-seat sports cars such as West designs) was created called the Sports Racer Series. The series however collapsed after only two rounds. The series is being revived for 2011, but will clash directly with the one-make Radical Australia Cup, the former New South Wales series expanding to a national series for the first time.

The show premiered on July 17, 2008. It was produced by Adam Sandler's production company Happy Madison Productions and Sony Pictures Television. Show format Faithful to the classic format, each show presented a contest between amateur performers of often dubious talent, with a panel of three celebrity judges. If any judge considered an act to be particularly bad, he or she could strike a large gong, thus forcing the performer to stop and eliminating that contestant from the competition. If the act survived without being gonged, the performers were given a score by each of the three judges on a scale of 0 to 500 (instead of 0 to 10), for a maximum possible score of 1,500. The contestant who achieved the highest combined score won the grand prize of $600 and a \\"Gong Show Championship Belt\\" trophy. The last act of each show (which was interrupted by a siren and the doors closing) was usually performed by David Juskow. The scores and prizes were brought out by Prize Girls Heidi Van Horne and Amy Harwick.

Directed by French filmmaker Georges Franju, the film stars Channing Pollock as Judex/Vallieres, Édith Scob as Jacqueline and Francine Bergé as Diana. Plot The plot revolves the banker Favraux, receiving a threatening note from Judex demanding that he pay back people he has swindled. He is later drugged by Judex and locked away. Meanwhile, the former governess, Diana, kidnaps Jacqueline to try to get the banker's money. Cast * Channing Pollock as Judex/Vallieres * Édith Scob as Jacqueline * Francine Bergé as Diana * Théo Sarapo as Morales * Sylva Koscina as Daisy * René Génin as Pierre Kerjean * Benjamin Boda as Réglisse the Boy * Jacques Jouanneau as Cocantin * Michel Vitold as the Banker Favraux Production=Development= The production of Judex happened by chance. French writer Francis Lacassin was writing an article on French film, and while doing research he was approached by a production manager with an idea for a film, when he suggested to do a film on Judex. The story came to Jacques Champreux who's the grandson of the original creator of Judex, Louis Feuillade. Jacques Champreux has been a fan of director Georges Franju and asked him to make the film, who accepted despite having a larger desire to remake Fantômas. Georges Franju was not very interested in the character or original story of Judex, stating that \\"Judex is the only film of Louis Feuillade that isn't good Louis Feuillade,\\" but he wanted to recreate the film in the style of early French cinema that he remembered from his childhood.Ince 2005, p. 58. Jacques Champreux's idea for the film was to combine Georges Franju's film style with the elements of the story in the original Judex and started writing the screenplay with that in mind. Jacques Champreux and Georges Franju had the film open with a costume ball where everyone is wearing animal masks. This scene is influenced by French cartoonist J.J. Grandville, who depicted people with the heads of animals and birds. =Casting= Channing Pollock, who was a famous conjurer in cabaret circles, was cast as Judex. Pollock had been in several films beforehand and the backing producers wanted to make him into a Rudolph Valentino-type star. Georges Franju and Jacques Champreux made his character into more of a magical character rather than a \\"dispenser of justice\\". Many actresses were thought of for the role of Diana Monti, originally played by Musidora in the Feuillade's Judex. Franju and Champreaux wanted someone who would \\"still look good even in the dark\\" and originally desired to have Brigitte Bardot as Diana Monti which excited their producers. After seeing Les Abysses at the Cannes Film Festival, they chose Francine Bergé who also played the role of Michele in the film. Franju cast Édith Scob as Jacqueline who he had worked with on his previous films, including Eyes Without a Face and Thérèse Desqueyroux. Release and reception Judex was released on December 4, 1963, in France. The general reception for the French critics of Judex was fairly positive, with most critics applauded the homage to the original silent film serial while noting the problems that arose when with the over- conscientious approach to style and atmosphere.Ince 2005, p. 57. A critic from L'Express wrote that the film was \\"pure entertainment, pure charm, a total success\\".Ince 2005, p. 56. while another from Les Nouvelles littéraires called the film's pacing \\"lazy\\" and the film direction \\"nonchalant, not to say laborious\\". Claude Mauriac of Le Figaro littéraire wrote that the film did not let the audience relate to the action as it was too caught up attracting them to the \\"plastic beauty\\" of the film. The film opened up to generally positive review in the United States as well. Variety wrote a positive review stating that the film was \\"...a successful homage to the French film serials of the early, silent days...[the film] does not send up this form of pic but rather captures its essential simplicity, adventurousness and innocence.\\" Time also wrote a positive review stating \\"Judex has too much low-key charm and seriousness to be wildly funny, but Director Franju seems content to woo a minority taste.\\" The New York Times wrote a negative review, stating that Judex \\"suffers from several afflictions, one of which is ambiguity. It is hard to tell whether Georges Franju, who made it, wants us to laugh at it or take it seriously.\\" Modern reception has been generally positive. Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote that Judex was \\"one of the better features of [Franju's] middle period\\". Time Out wrote that the film is \\"superbly elegant\\" and an \\"enjoyable tribute to the adventure fantasies of Louis Feuillade\\".

Wodehouse-novelist *William Zinsser- writer, editor, literary critic, teacher While Horizon remained bi-monthly up to July 1962, volume IV, there was an anomalous volume V that had eight issues. After November 1963, there were only four issues a year, and the magazine changed its issue dates to the current season rather than a month. This is shown in Linda Prestwidge's master table of contents for hard cover Horizon issues in the reference link below. From Winter 1964, volume VI, to January 1977, volume XIX, Horizon produced four issues a year which are still prized by collectors and actively traded on the Internet. Horizon Magazine master table of contents. See: . The May 1977 issue contained an insert from the publisher, Rhett Austell, informing the subscribers that Horizon would become a monthly magazine in soft cover.Horizon, volume XIX, number 3, American Heritage Publishing Co., New York, 1977. The reason was plainly financial. Horizon was not able to attract enough subscribers to maintain the luxury magazine devoted to the arts and history that had been envisioned by Thorndike and Parton. Austell referred in this insert to \\"a time of inflationary prices\\" and announced that Otto Fuerbringer, a former editor at Time magazine, had been hired as editor of Horizon. There was an editorial in this issue describing the changes in the quality of the printing, binding, and content imposed by the shorter time between issues. The July 1977 issue, volume XIX, number 4, had another insert from the publisher confirming that this would be the last hard-cover issue. The response from the subscribers to the lower quality of printing and binding and a new emphasis on current events was overwhelmingly negative, resulting in the sale of Horizon to Boone, Inc. a year later. American Heritage also published books under the Horizon name, such as 1961's Horizon Book of the Renaissance, edited by Richard M. Ketchum and written by Plumb, with contributors including Trevor Roper, Kenneth Clark, Iris Origo and Jacob Bronowski. (). Boone years In December 1978, publication of Horizon moved from New York City, New York, to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and the magazine changed to a softcover format, published monthly. The new owner was Boone Inc., with editor and publisher Gray D. Boone. Contributors included Robert Joffrey, Alan Rich, Lanford Wilson, Ray Bradbury and Brendan Gill. Publication ceased eleven years later, with volume 32, number 2, March/April 1989.

It is conducted by Anna University on behalf of the Government of Tamil Nadu. It was scrapped in 2006 and replaced by Unified Single Window Counselling, solely based on +2 board marks. Content The Entrance examination contains 3 papers: Mathematics, Physical Science (Physics and Chemistry) and Biology. Each paper carries 50 marks and it follows Multiple Choice Question pattern. The performance in the TNPCEE is combined with the performance in the Class 12 Board Examination to arrive at a \\"cut-off\\" which is used to determine the rank of the students. TNPCEE carries 100 marks and Class 12 Board Examination carries 200 marks (marks obtained in Class 12 Board Examination of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry normalized to 100 marks, 50 marks and 50 marks respectively). History TNPCEE was first conducted in 1989 by Anna University. Before that an interview was conducted but this was found to be inadequate. Anna University has the impeccable record of conducting the test without any question or answers keys being leaked. Controversies For some years there have been controversies surrounding TNPCEE. *The first one was the wrong questions asked in the question paper which occurred two years in a row. *The next one is the discarding of the TNPCEE marks for the admission for the academic year of 2005 by the Tamil Nadu Government. This was later reversed by the court and TNPCEE marks were taken into consideration. *The Tamil Nadu Government deciding to scrap the TNPCEE from the academic year 2006–07 and base admissions into professional courses solely based on the Class 12 examinations. This was reversed by the Madras High Court and the Tamil Nadu Government has appealed in the Supreme Court and its judgment is awaited. The ostensible reason is to create a level playing field for the rural students. The Government claims that urban students have an edge in the Entrance Examination. Almost all the major political parties, the most vociferous being the Pattali Makkal Katchi party, are against TNPCEE. The Class 12 Board Examination is insufficient when it comes to ranking the students. Many students obtain the same marks and to break the tie it was suggested that date of birth be used. If the date of birth were also to match lots would be used (In 2005–06 when the TN Government discarded TNPCEE marks this happened). This would certainly cause heart-burn among the students. TNPCEE is conducted to reduce the probability of many students obtaining same marks. In the year 2005, an attempt was made by the erstwhile Tamil Nadu government to revoke TNPCEE pattern of engineering admissions. Tamil Nadu government, based on the reservation policies, defended that the admission be made solely on the 12’Th standard marks. This brought a lot critics attention who warned that would abysmally lower the engineering education since Plus 2 examinations tests mostly of a student's memory retention whereas TNPCEE tests the student's problem solving capabilities. High court of Chennai quashed this idea of admission. Hence the TNPCEE admission system is back in vogue.  TNPCEE 2006  After all the controversy about scrapping the TNPCEE, the Tamil Nadu government finally decided to hold it on 18 and 19 May 2006. Initially, all the self-financing and government aided colleges in Tamil Nadu were to admit students considering the cut-off with the TNPCEE marks. Then, by a ruling called the Inaamdar Commission, around 180 self-financing colleges decided to break away from the TNPCEE clique and formed the TNSF (Tamil Nadu Self Financing) Consortium. This consortium then conducted an exam called the CET on 15 and 16 July. First, this consortium was to fill up 100% of its seats based on a cut-off combining the board marks and the CET marks. But now, by a court ruling, all minority colleges have surrendered 50% of their seats and non-minority colleges have surrendered 70% of their seats to the TNPCEE pool. This means that the CET marks will be used to fill only 50% in minority and 30% in non-minority colleges. Counselling for general category candidates started on 21 July 2006. The vacancy positions at the end of each day are shown on the Anna University Website. There is, however, no information brochure available online. The State Government has been following the rule of 69% reservation for SC/ST/OBC etc. This year, a high court ruling has stated that this reservation should not exceed 50%. Due to this, the excess 19% seats have been allocated in the open category under the title FOC - Fifty percent Open Category. This has led to increased number of seats from self- financing and government colleges for the open category. Also, there will be no second round of counselling for TNPCEE. Seats that have been taken and discarded will not be available to other deserving students but will be wasted for a year and then offered to diploma holders who are eligible for lateral entry. =Counselling process= The candidates are divided into time-slots according to their state rank and are required to report at the counselling venue at their allotted slot. Here, they can collect their counselling passes after paying the counselling fee. The students then go to the \\"Briefing Hall\\" where there are two big screens showing the seats that are currently available in all colleges under the TNPCEE. Here, the original certificates are verified and the candidates are called for the actually counselling in order of their state rank. Once in the counselling room, there are around 40 terminals at which students can make their choice. Each terminal has a person who assists the student in the counselling. When a student is allotted a terminal, the student is supposed to enter their top three choices. Before doing this, the student can check up on seat status of various colleges. Once this is done, a screen appears which shows choices and also how many people above you are yet to click their choices. You will be able to freeze a choice only when students above you in rank have frozen theirs. As the number of students above you keeps decreasing, if there is a sure chance of your getting your preferred college and branch, that particular choice becomes green indicating that your seat there is assured.

She wrote eighty three novels, all aimed at young women, most of which were published in the series Bibliothèque rose and Bibliothèque bleue. Her writings were initially published under the pseudonym Anna Edianez, Edianez being an anagram of Zénaïde and Anna being derived from one of her own given names, Anne. She also wrote under the names Anna Edianez de Saint-B. and Anna Edianez de L. Biography Zénaïde Fleuriot was born in Saint-Brieuc, Brittany to a devoutly Catholic and Royalist family, faithful to the Bourbons. Her parents had sixteen children of which only five survived. Her father, Jean-Marie, having lost his mother as a child, was brought up by his uncle, a priest, who was shot by the Revolutionaries in Brest in 1794 for refusing to sign the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. At the age of fourteen he had fought in the Battle of Austerlitz (1802). Repatriated in 1806, he turned to the study of law, becoming an advocate in Saint-Brieuc. During the July Monarchy he lost his fortune and his job after attacking the régime in the aftermath of the 1830 Revolution. Zenaïde Fleuriot was deeply influenced by the political and religious milieu of her family environment. Between 1849 and 1860, she worked as governess to the children of the Guillotou family in Kerever, staying in Saint-Brieuc during the winter and in Château-Billy, Ploufragan, during the summer. During this period she produced a significant number of novels, which gave her financial independence. In 1867, suffering from depression, she contemplated abandoning literature. Her deep Christianity led her to dream of living a sequestered religious life. In Rome, she met Princess Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, another Catholic writer, who became her confidante. Wittgenstein convinced her to continue with her literary career. She resumed literary work. In 1871 she founded and later led a vocational school intended to promote youth employment. In the spring of 1872, Fleuriot visited her deceased brother’s children and their mother at the seaside town of Locmariaquer. She fell in love with this little port, acquiring a large estate in 1873 with a magnificent view over the Gulf of Morbihan. She built a house which she named \\"Kermoareb\\" (meaning \\"My Aunt’s House\\" in the Breton language). It was here that she wrote one of her best- known novels, Petit chef de famille. The tomb of Zénaïde Fleuriot in LocmariaquerAfter her death in Paris, her body was transported by train from Gare Montparnasse back to Brittany to be buried in the cemetery of Locmariaquer as she had requested. The coffin was carried to the grave by eight local sailors. The grave is in the form of a menhir referring to the famous neolithic site directly behind the graveyard. Literary career Fleuriot published a number of essays under the name Anna Edianez, but very soon her early novels were published under the name Zénaïde Fleuriot. After her early publications she worked for the Journal des demoiselles et la Mode illustrée. Her novel Aigles et colombes (Eagles and Doves) was rewarded by the Académie française with a 1500 Franc prize. She was a constant contributor to \\"Le Journal de la jeunesse\\" and \\"La Bibliothèque rose\\", whose aim was to provide young people with unobjectionable reading. Her novels are written in a simple, easy style. Her background gave her a deep respect for traditional Christian and family values, which infused her work. This helped to make her work very popular among the Catholic middle class. From 1874 to 1879, she edited the journal la Semaine des familles.

She performed in both series of Gladiators under the name Inferno, sporting red hair and a fiery, flirtatious personality. Despite not appearing on the American version, BBC America aired Gladiators in the United States. As a cadet, she also later appeared on Sky1's Battle of The Forces which pitted the British Army, Royal Navy and RAF against each other. Some of the most popular gladiators characters, including Gladiator Inferno, were imortalised as action figures for fans to purchase and are now collectables.  Professional wrestling career = Independent circuit promotions (2005–present) = Along with her other exploits Palmer also was a fan of wrestling, particularly the original incarnation of D-Generation X. In 2005, she began to appear for the Frontier Wrestling Alliance (FWA) mainly as a valet for Doug Williams. This led to her having a try out match with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) alongside Katarina Waters who went on to become Katie Lea Burchill. Although she was not signed, she was later offered a scholarship to train at Ultimate Pro Wrestling. During her time on the circuit, Palmer filmed a reality television show based on pro wrestling as one of the three lead stars. After much training, she was booked for her debut match against Jetta at Pro- Wrestling: EVE's first show on 8 May 2010 in Sudbury, Suffolk. Before her match with Jetta she suffered an injury in her hand but wrestled the match anyway, with a storyline written in that Jetta attacked her and goaded her into a match while she was explaining the injury to the crowd. The referee stopped the contest and awarded it to Jetta out of concern for Palmer's health. Palmer joined the British wrestling company UKW, where on season 1 episode 22 she became the UKW Women's Champion. Here, she was introduced to the crowd as \\"Inferno Jemma Palmer\\" and was accompanied to the ring by her sister Faye. You can watch the show on My Channel on Sky TV and watch Palmer's matches on YouTube. = World Wrestling Entertainment / WWE = On 29 June 2009 it was announced that Palmer had signed a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment. and on 1 March 2010 it was announced that Palmer was going to be A WWE Diva.  Business interests  In October 2011, Palmer invested in a company called www.buffnakedbutlers.co.uk, which provides semi-naked butlers for events in Wales and England. She also part owns cocktail and events company www.TipsyParties.co.uk In November 2017 Jemma launched tech company www.InfinitusUnlimited.com a business consultancy providing business automation and workflow streamlining.

The PJBHL already included the Fort St. John Huskies, Dawson Creek Canucks, and Grande Prairie North Stars. Previously, Fort St. John won the Cyclone Taylor Cup as British Columbia Jr. B Champions in 1969 as a member of the Peace Jr. B League. With the expansion, the PJBHL became the Peace-Cariboo Junior Hockey League. The first championship of the new PCJHL was won by Prince George, but Quesnel won the league and the Cyclone Taylor Cup as BC Champions in 1977, 1978, and 1979 and the Grande Prairie North Stars won the Russ Barnes Trophy and Alberta champions in 1976. In 1980 the PCJHL became a Junior \\"A\\" League, one season after the British Columbia Junior Hockey League-Pacific Coast Junior Hockey League merger. The league's most successful team, by far, was the Prince George Spruce Kings. Every season, their playoff champion earned the right to play for the Mowat Cup, the British Columbia Junior \\"A\\" Title. The PCJHL/RMJHL was eligible for the Royal Bank Cup, the Junior \\"A\\" National Title. In 1991, the Peace Cariboo league doubled in size when it took in a portion of the Jr. B Kootenay International Junior Hockey League and renamed itself the Rocky Mountain league. The original teams to the North would form the Peace-Cariboo Division, while the newer teams to the South would form the Kootenay Division. In 1995, the Trail Smoke Eaters walked away from the league and joined the British Columbia Hockey League. In 1996, the entire Peace-Cariboo Division left the Kootenay Division behind when the Prince George Spruce Kings and Quesnel Millionaires jumped to the BCHL, the Grande Prairie Chiefs jumped to the Alberta Junior Hockey League, the Williams Lake Mustangs went defunct, and the Fort St. John Huskies jumped to Hockey Alberta's North West Junior Hockey League. To fill the void left when the Peace-Cariboo Division folded in 1996, the Castlegar Rebels joined the fold. In 1998, however, the Rebels would return to the KIJHL and the Cranbrook Colts would fold to make way for the Western Hockey League's Kootenay Ice.http://esportsdesk.com/leagues/custom_page.cfm?leagueID=14327&clientID;=4369&link;=Mills&pageid;=6032 Left with 4 teams, the 4 teams of the RMJHL (Creston Valley Thunder, Kimberley Dynamiters, Nelson Leafs, and Fernie Ghostriders) played an interlocking schedule with the America West Hockey League of USA Hockey. On February 12, 1999, the commissioner of the RMJHL, Bronco Horvath, presented a letter to the management of the British Columbia Hockey League proposing the four remaining teams join the BCHL as a \\"Kootenay Division\\". The proposal was universally rejected by the BCHL. After the 1998-99 season, Creston took a one-year hiatus which forced the RMJHL to fold. Nelson jumped to the KIJHL. Kimberley and Fernie outright joined the AWHL for the 1999-00 season and Kimberley left for the KIJHL in 2001, while Fernie moved to the North American Hockey League in 2003 before joining the KIJHL in 2004. Creston returned to hockey after one year off in 2000 with the KIJHL. =The Mowat Cup= The Mowat Cup is the championship trophy of Junior A hockey in British Columbia. For 19 years, starting in 1981, the champion of the RMJHL was forced to square off against the champion of the British Columbia Hockey League for the right to face the Alberta Junior Hockey League champion in the Doyle Cup. In the end, the BCHL had a virtually spotless record against the RMJHL, winning all 19 Mowat Cups and compiling a record 48 wins and 1 loss in that time frame. In fact, until the 1999 Mowat Cup (the final year of the RMJHL's existence), no BCHL champion had ever lost a playoff game against a RMJHL champion. In the 1999 Mowat Cup, the Kimberley Dynamiters were able to snap the losing streak against the BCHL's Vernon Vipers before losing the series.

His brief term was marred by the vigilance movement, Chinese immigration issues, collecting back taxes from the city's most prominent citizens of the day, and uncooperative elected officials.

Shortly after, he taught philosophy at Issenheim in Alsace, then exegesis at the Catholic University of Leuven, theology at Cologne, philosophy at Bonn and Aachen, and theology at Maria-Laach.

Wilmers also attended the First Vatican Council in 1870 as theologian of Bishop Leo Meurin, Vicar Apostolic of Bombay. After a brief residence at Bonn and Munster, he went to Ordrupshoj near Copenhagen where he wrote against the attacks on the Catholic Church by the Protestant preacher Martensen. This work was translated into Danish by the prefect Apostolic Hermann Grüder and published under the latter's name with the title: \\"Det protestaniske og katholiske Trosprincip\\" (Copenhagen, 1875).

Pilasters, topped with plasterwork urns, terminate the elevation and the frontage currently features two signs reading 'Dancing' and 'Tonight'. =Interior= The ballroom comprises an eclectic mix of neo-classical, Deco and oriental motifs set within an exotic and luxuriant decorative scheme mainly dating from the 1950s. The main auditorium ceiling survives from the earlier cinema. From the off-street entrance steps a small foyer is reached featuring a raked floor and Deco-style marquetry panelling. The main motif is a geometric composition of intersecting curves in a shape with broad segmental top, tapering centre and curved base. The design is accentuated through the use of dark wood inlay and a diamond shape in the centre is picked out in glass or mirror. Although 1920s in inspiration, it is characteristic of the 1950s fashion for reviving the Deco aesthetic that had been unwillingly abandoned with the onset of WWII. The foyer leads directly into the ballroom, a large auditorium with a shallow barrel-vaulted ceiling, complete with raised viewing dais, stage, proscenium, fixed banquettes and a sprung maple dance floor. The decorative scheme is kitsch and flamboyant, the effect created through red velour padded walls with gilt picture-frame style panels and decorated pilasters, scallop-shaped lights, a red velour pelmet, French chandeliers and Chinese lanterns. Either side of the ballroom are two bars, running the length of the hall, one dating 1958 and the other of 1960. The right hand bar of 1958 features booths and tables with leather upholstery arranged similar to a railway-carriage. The bar at the end of the room has a tiled front of Arabesque interlaced patterns. Lighting is provided by exotic saucer-shaped lamps decorated with a mixture of Georgian and oriental patterns. The panelling motif established in the foyer is continued on various doors, to the ladies powder room and the gentleman's cloakroom for example, and there is also signage throughout the building some of which, to the 'Buffet' for example, appears to be contemporary with the late 1950s refurbishment. There is a second function room, dating from the late twentieth century, with a neo-classical decorative scheme with gilded Corinthian capitals, a modillion cornice and Adam-esque garlands along the beams which support a ceiling adorned with photographs of Old Master paintings; this room is not of special interest. Venue usage It has found favour with pop video producers and style shootsThe Rivoli Ballroon: Foxtrots and Fancy Flock – Tina Turner's \\"Private Dancer\\" video was shot there and rock band Oasis, pop group S Club 7, singers Charlotte Church and Martine McCutcheon, fashion model Kate Moss are some glitterati to make use of the venue for shoots. It is probably most famously remembered for its use in the 1983 Elton John video for the song \\"I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues\\". Live music plays a part at the Rivoli regularly. Indie rock band The White Stripes played a gig there on 12 June 2007. Florence + the Machine played a live show there on 7 July 2009, which appears on the DVD packaged with the special edition box set of Lungs, and returned there on 8 November 2012 for a Radio 2 Live In Concert broadcast. On 30 April 2014, Damon Albarn performed with his touring band The Heavy Seas, with a guest appearance by Kano. It is, however, more usual to find jive, rock and roll and swing bands making use of the ballroom. Television host Justin Lee Collins also filmed his chat-show series Good Times there in March 2010. On 27 October 2010, Kings Of Leon performed a set for BBC Radio 1. The music video released for Lana Del Rey's promotional single, \\"Burning Desire\\", was filmed at the Rivoli Ballroom by Ridley Scott in 2013. The Rivoli Ballroom has been a location for some films. In 2014, the ballroom was used for a flashback sequence shot in the 1940s for the superhero film Avengers: Age of Ultron. Some scenes of the 2016 film The Infiltrator were shot here.https://secretldn.com/rivoli-ballroom-vintage-london/ In March 2015, Noel Gallagher played a 'secret gig' for Absolute Radio, promoting his second solo album Chasing Yesterday.http://absoluteradio.co.uk/schedule/the-q-radio- show-151/episodes/38592/. In August 2017, Martine McCutcheon filmed her music video for 'Any Sign Of Life' from her latest album, 'Lost and Found'. The Rivoli Ballroom is used for dance scene in the season 3 finale of Killing Eve. Parts of music video for \\"A Love like That\\", lead single of Katie Melua's \\"Album No. 8\\", were filmed in Rivoli Ballroom. Listed building On 21 December 2007, the building was granted Grade II-listed status by English Heritage in response to press concern about a possible sale, which might have led to its closure and demolition.Listed Status for Rivoli The venue was listed for the following reasons: *Special architectural interest: for the highly unusual interior of 1958, the total effect of which is luxuriant, exotic and deeply theatrical. *Special historic interest: as an eloquent and unusual witness to the era of American jive and swing bands, lindy hop, jitterbug and rock 'n' roll, alongside the continued popularity of traditional strict tempo ballroom. *A rare surviving example of a once common conversion of an early 20th-century cinema to a ballroom. In conclusion it was noted: \\"The Rivoli Ballroom is a highly unusual building which is of special architectural interest for its flamboyant interior and special historic interest for its rarity as a surviving 1950s dance hall in a former cinema.\\" Transport connections The ballroom is at 350 Brockley Road, which is opposite Crofton Park railway station and on several bus routes.

It is particularly notable for its pink colour. A long and thin shore divides the Southern Ocean from the lake.  Description  Lake Hillier is about in length by about in width. The lake is surrounded by a rim of sand and a dense woodland of paperbark and eucalyptus trees with a narrow strip of sand dunes covered by vegetation separating its northern edge from the northern coast of Middle Island. The most notable feature of the lake is its pink, vibrant colour. The vibrant colour is permanent, and does not alter when the water is taken in a container. The pink colour is considered to be due to the presence of the organism Dunaliella salina. The Extreme Microbiome Project, part of the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities (ABRF), Metagenomics Research Group (MGRG), has performed a metagenomic analysis on the lake to find Dunaliella as well as Salinibacter ruber, Dechloromonas aromatica, and a few species of the Archaea. Air is the best mode of transportation for viewing the lake. At one point in its history the lake was used to collect salt.  History = European discovery and use = Lake Hillier was visited by the Matthew Flinders' expedition on 15 January 1802. Flinders' journal entries are considered to be the first written records of the lake. Flinders observed the pink lake after ascending the island's highest peak (now called Flinders Peak), describing the lake as follows: > In the north-eastern part was a small lake of a rose colour, the water of > which, as I was informed by Mr. Thistle who visited it, was so saturated > with salt that sufficient quantities were crystallised near the shores to > load a ship. The specimen he brought on board was of a good quality, and > required no other process than drying to be fit for use. Flinders visited Middle Island again in May 1803; he intended \\"to stop a day or two in Goose-Island Bay, for the purposes of procuring geese for our sick people, seal oil for our lamps, and a few casks of salt from the lake on Middle Island\\". It is reported that Flinders subsequently named the lake after William Hillier, a crew member of Investigator who died of dysentery on 20 May 1803 prior to the expedition's departure from Middle Island. In 1889, Edward Andrews investigated the commercial possibilities of producing salt from Lake Hillier, and briefly moved onto the island with both of his sons. They left after working the salt deposits for about one year. The lake was subject to salt mining during the late 19th century. The salt mining enterprise is reported as failing for a number of reasons including \\"the toxicity of the salt collected for consumption\\".  Forms of life  Lake Hillier Shoreline The only living organisms in Lake Hillier are microorganisms including Dunaliella salina, red algae which cause the salt content in the lake to create a red dye which helps produce the color, as well as red halophilic bacteria, bacterioruberin, present in the salt crusts. Despite the unusual hue, the lake exhibits no known adverse effects upon humans. From above, the lake appears a solid bubble gum pink, but from the shoreline it appears more of a clear pink hue. The shoreline is also covered in salt crust deposits. In 2016 scientists from the Extreme Microbiome Project conducted extensive microbiome and metagenomic DNA sequencing and detected Haloquadratum, Haloferax, Salinibacter, Halobacterium, Halogeometricum, and several other halophilic organisms. Culturing from the water revealed a low concentration of Psychroflexus as well.  Safety and accessibility  Despite the high salt content levels (comparable to those of the Dead Sea), Lake Hillier is safe to swim in. However it is not advisable nor allowed without previous approval by the Western Australia Dept of Environment Conservation However, there are very few ways to reach Lake Hillier. Aeroplane scenic flights are the most common method, with six flights a day departing Esperance Airport, flying over Lake Hillier via the nearby Cape Le Grand National Park. Cruises are also an option for passengers wanting to visit the isolated lake, and surrounding forest area.  Protected area status  As recently as 2012, Lake Hillier has been located within the boundaries of the Recherche Archipelago Nature Reserve. Since 2002, the lake itself has been considered to be a wetland of \\"subregional significance\\".

The character had no origin story, and existed only as a giant, floating, disembodied eye, wreathed in a halo of golden light. This powerful being was obsessed with the concept of justice, and existed to encourage average people to do what they could to attain it for themselves. If the obstacles proved too great, the Eye would assist its mortal charges by working miracles. Time and space meant nothing to the Eye and it existed as a physical embodiment of man's inner conscience. The Eye appeared in the pages of Centaur's Keen Detective Funnies for 16 issues (cover-dated December 1939 – September 1940), in a feature entitled \\"The Eye Sees\\". The feature began with the book's 16th issue, and continued until the title folded after its 24th issue (September, 1940). Following its run in Keen Detective, Centaur promoted the Eye to its own book, Detective Eye, which ran for two issues (Nov.-Dec. 1940) before folding as well. A copycat feature called \\"The Hand\\" appeared in Harvey Comics' Speed Comics issues #12-13 (March-May 1941), with a huge disembodied hand tapping people on the shoulder and admonishing them for their wrongdoing. Characteristics The Eye had the ability to fly, appear and disappear, melt solid steel and bring invisible forces to bear, but had to work with human agents to fight crime. The Eye was a magical being \\"to whom time and distance are nothing — who bares man's thoughts and pierces his conscience!\\" Don Markstein writes: The Eye was assisted by human Jack Barrister, who helps the Eye pursue criminals and bring them to justice.\\" =Golden Age appearances= The Eye had eleven Golden Age appearances.

Biography  Omar Bradley grew up in Compton, California. As an adult, he stayed in the neighborhood and taught high school before entering politics. In 1991, Bradley defeated Pedro Pallan to become City Councilman for the 1st District of Compton. Despite winning the race decisively with 2,904 votes over Pallan's 1,577, Bradley adopted a very conciliatory tone, when he said, \\"My first priority is to extend the olive branch to the Latino community, find out what they lack in city services and find out how to meet them.\\" Just two years later in the spring of 1993, Bradley faced off against Councilwoman Patricia A. Moore for the city's top job. In a bitterly fought runoff campaign, Bradley received just 349 votes over Moore to replace the outgoing Mayor Walter R. Tucker III. Immediately upon taking office, Bradley stirred controversy. During his campaign he had garnered the support of many Latino voters with the promise that if he were elected mayor, he would appoint a Latino to replace him on the council. It was generally assumed that he would appoint his former opponent Pallan, who was the first Latino in Compton to qualify for a run-off election. On the night of the presumed appointment, Bradley joined two other council members to appoint political newcomer Ronald Green, an African American instead. That fall, comments he made regarding the violence in rap videos angered members of the Jewish community. When gangster rapper Eazy-E was seeking permission to film a music video in Compton, Bradley scolded him during a council meeting by saying that he was being exploited by a \\"specific ethnic group\\" that was \\"having a bar mitzvah at the same time.\\" On October 13, 1993 he held a press conference with Eazy-E to announce his approval of the music video and to apologize for his previous remarks. In 2001, Bradley narrowly lost his bid for re-election to a third term to political novice Eric J. Perrodin. Controversies After leaving office, Bradley was investigated and convicted of misappropriating public funds during his tenure as City Mayor. Bradley was convicted of using a city-issued credit card to pay for golf rounds, hotel rooms, clothing and in-room movies, among other things. He was convicted of taking cash advances for city business expenses and then charging those items to his city credit cards and pocketing the money. Bradley charged over $3,800 in personal expenses on his City credit card, double- billed the City over $3,700 and in addition failed to return travel advances for two conferences that the jury could infer he failed to attend. The district attorneys office alleged that Bradley misspent closer to $19,000. City Manager John D. Johnson II and council member Amen Rahh were convicted on similar charges of misappropriating public funds and were sentenced to prison. On May 14, 2004 Bradley was sentenced to three years in state prison on felony corruption charges. Bradley served his time in a halfway house, from which he was allowed to leave five days a week to work in a job-training program for the developmentally disabled in Carson, California. Bradley was released in August 2005 because he had served jail time while awaiting trial. Bradley's corruption conviction was overturned by an appeals court in August 2012. 2013 Campaign for Mayor of Compton Omar Bradley ran again for mayor of Compton, Ca in 2013. He came in a close second in the primary nominating election on April 16, 2013. Bradley came in with 26.5% with Aja Brown receiving 27.8% of the vote. The incumbent mayor, Eric J. Perrodin, ended up in third place with only 24.5% of the vote. Brown defeated Bradley in the June 4 runoff by a 64% to 36% margin.

That same season, Boise State was ranked as high as second in the nation, went to the Sweet 16 in the NCAA Tournament and finished fifth. He moved full-time to U.S. national team coaching duties when he first left Boise State in 1998, coaching primarily at the junior level. In winter of 2002-03, he led the National boys 14's team to a World Junior Cup Championship, beating teams from Spain and Argentina to take the title. He has coached several junior players to finish in the top five in the world rankings. Before coaching for U.S.A. Tennis on a full-time basis, Patton had coached with junior national teams for several years. =Back to Boise= Patton returned for a second Boise State tour in March 2003 and marked that comeback with a bang that led to a trophy – the 2003 Western Athletic Conference Championship. Patton took over a team that was 5-5 and led the Broncos to a 13-3 run and three consecutive upsets (over Tulsa, Rice and SMU) to win the WAC Championship and then a first-round NCAA Tournament upset over Arizona before being stopped in the round of 32 by California. The Broncos celebrated the season with a final ranking of 34th, one region honoree (senior Marcus Berntson), and two All-WAC honorees (Berntson and junior Guillaume Bouvier). In his 28 years of collegiate coaching, Coach Patton has led his teams to 17 Conference Titles. In his second season back at Boise State (2003–2004), Coach Patton lead the Broncos to a 24-8 record, and third place finish in the WAC, and a National ranking that hovered between 30 and 45th in the nation. The final ranking was 45th. Boise State was ranked #1 in the Mountain Region and qualified as the regional representative in the National Team Indoor Championships. Senior Guillaume Bouvier earned a Singles All American Honor by reaching the round of 16 at the NCAA Championships. This past season (2004–2005), the Broncos under Coach Patton's leadership won the WAC Conference for the second time in the past three years, earned a berth to the NCAA National Team Championships where they defeated North Carolina before losing to Texas A&M.; The final national ranking for the Broncos was 31st in the nation with a 31-8 record. Freshman Luke Shields was named an All American in singles and doubles. Partner Thomas Schoeck earned All American Honors in doubles. They finished the season ranked 8th in the nation. Luke was named Freshman of the Year by the Mountain Region (Region VII). Team Captain, Beck Roghaar was honored with the Regional Arthur Ashe Sportsmanship/Leadership Award. * 2003 BSU Men's Head Coach (Mid Season) - As of the 2003 season, he has won seven league titles in three different conferences in eight seasons. * Coached Boy's 14's National Team to World Championships in Prostejvo, Czech Republic (first time that USA has won this international team event) August, 2002 * USA National Tennis Coach (USTA High Performance Tennis) * Boise State Men's Tennis Coach 1993-1998 (record 135-48) Led Boise State to top 20 National Rankings during these six years and as high as #2 in Division I Won Big Sky and Big West conference Titles (5 out of 6 seasons) * World TeamTennis Coach (1990-1993 > Newport Beach Dukes), (1994-1997 > Idaho Sneakers) Reached Championships of World Team Tennis in Three Seasons. * USA Pan American Coach in 1991 (Games held in Havana, Cuba) USA won 3 gold medals and one silver out of four events played. * UC Irvine Men's Tennis Coach 1980-1992 (record 288-150) Led UC Irvine to top 20 National Ranking in 10 out of 13 Seasons and as high #2 in Division I Won Big West Conference Title 9 out of 13 Seasons Named Big West Conference Coach of the Year - 1981, 1983, 1985, 1987, 1988 (Five Awards) * USA Junior National Coach 1984-1987 (Junior Davis Cup) * Overall Collegiate Coaching Record (1977–1998) 486-241 Including UC Santa Barbara (1977–1978) and Cal State Bakersfield (1979) =World TeamTennis= Patton is currently the head coach of the WTT St. Louis Aces.

It opened in 1961. The mall was demolished in 2007 to make way for a new $150 million mixed-use development called \\"Constellation.\\" History The Heart of Huntsville Mall was the first enclosed shopping mall in Huntsville when it opened in 1961. The single-story complex was built just outside downtown at the intersection of Clinton Avenue and Memorial Parkway. Its major tenant was a Sears at the southern end of the mall. Heart of Huntsville hosted many community events over the years including several Scout Expos and craft fairs. The long-running Delta Zeta Arts and Crafts Show began in 1967 with roughly 100 booths at Heart of Huntsville Mall. The mall prospered for decades until the opening of Madison Square Mall in west Huntsville in 1984. Sears moved to Madison Square and, over time, other tenants would close as well. The Woolworth's closed in 1992. As major chain stores closed, local businesses moved in to take advantage of lower rents. In the late 1990s the center was renamed \\"Market Square.\\" The two anchor tenants were Burlington Coat Factory and Gold's Gym with various smaller tenants including a club called \\"721,\\" an exercise equipment shop, and Ivey's Restaurant. In the early 2000s the owner of the mall, Scott McLain, began plans to redevelop the center. He had recently completed a redevelopment of \\"The Mall\\", just north of Heart of Huntsville, into a power center with tenants such as Home Depot and Costco. By mid-2007, all but one of the tenants, a tanning salon, had moved out of the mall to make way for a $150 million mixed-use development called \\"Constellation.\\" Future By September 2007, all of the former Heart of Huntsville Mall was razed to make way for Constellation, a mixed-use development that is projected to include retail, restaurants, two five-story, 160-room hotels (a Residence Inn by Marriott and a SpringHill Suites), of office space, and a seven-story condo/apartment tower with up to 80 residential units. The complex will also include a multi-deck parking garage. The developer had initially suggested that restaurants on the site might include a Hard Rock Cafe or Cheesecake Factory but in November 2007 he announced that these concepts were unsuitable for the market and other concepts were being researched. In January 2008, Huntsville City Council president Glenn Watson suggested that the site might also be a good home for a new City Hall. Site construction on the project began in the Spring of 2008, with completion expected in 2010. McLain told The Huntsville Times that the name Constellation is \\"a nod to Huntsville's space heritage, while also reflecting that it offers a 'collection' of venues, just as a constellation is a collection of stars.\\" Construction on the SpringHill Suites began in August 2008 with a Courtyard by Marriott projected as \\"soon to follow\\". , only the SpringHill Suites has been constructed and is open for business. The site includes a tree planted in 1961, the year the original mall opened, and the developer plans to continue to include this tree in the \\"Constellation\\" development. McLain is working to have the project Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified.

He was known as a \\"man of words\\" for his poetic use of the Hebrew language in his lyrics. His influences included Hebrew poets such as ibn Gabirol, Natan Alterman, S. Y. Agnon and Hayim Nahman Bialik, and American singer-songwriters such as Bob Dylan. Ariel's fame and recognition is largely posthumous. Biography A '70s-era Meir Ariel performance Ariel was born on the Fast of Esther in 1942 and grew up in Kibbutz Mishmarot. Since childhood he was a friend of Shalom Hanoch, who also lived there and who went on to become one of Israel's most popular rock artists. Ariel served in the Paratroopers Brigade of the IDF and participated as part of that brigade in the Battle for Jerusalem at the beginning of the Six-Day War. This inspired him to write the song \\"Yerushalayim Shel Barzel\\" (\\"Jerusalem of Iron\\"). The song was based on Naomi Shemer's hit song \\"Jerusalem of Gold\\", and borrowed its melody (in turn borrowed from the Basque folk song \\"Pello Joxepe\\"). It was his reaction to what he saw as the hyper-patriotism of the Israeli public and media of that time. The \\"Yerushalayim Shel Barzel\\" mini-album cover showed Ariel in his military uniform thus giving him the nickname \\"the singing paratrooper\\".מאיר אריאל - שירה עובדת After living in the United States for some time, Ariel returned to Israel and decided to create folk rock-inspired music. He fought in the Yom Kippur War in the Suez Canal and returned to Mishmarót after the war. Between 1978 and 1988, he released his first three LPs. The first album's title, Shirey Chag Umoed Venofel, is a play on words of the term \\"Shirèy Chag uMoèd\\" which means \\"holiday songs\\". The album's title could also mean, in Hebrew, \\"songs for circling, tripping, and falling\\". In 1987, Ariel, his wife Tirtza, and their three children moved to Tel Aviv. Between 1990 and 1997, he released one more LP, one collection album, one live album and three more LPs, the last one being Bernard veLouise [Bernard and Louise]. Ariel died on July 18, 1999 from the Mediterranean spotted (or \\"Boutonneuse\\") fever which is caused by the rickettsia parasite and transmitted by a tick bite. He was buried in Mishmarot's cemetery. Several tribute albums performed by various Israeli artists performing his songs were released posthumously, among them several live memorial performances, and a track-by-track re-recording of his 1995 album Rishumey Pecham [charcoal sketches]. An album of Ariel's own unreleased recordings was released as well, titled \\"Mode Ani\\", which can be translated as \\"I am thankful\\" (based on the Jewish morning prayer). Among the many artists for whom Meir Ariel wrote are Shalom Hanoch, Arik Einstein, Rita, Sharon Haziz and David Broza. In 2009, the Israeli postal service issued a stamp in his honor. Ariel is one of the central characters in Yossi Klein Halevi's 2013 Like Dreamers: The Story of the Israeli Paratroopers Who Reunited Jerusalem and Divided a Nation (and Halevi's book is the closest to an English-language biography of Ariel to appear).

Watkins travelled across Herefordshire as an 'out- rider' representing the family businesses and so got to know the area intimately.

Photo: Tony French Watkins was also a respected photographer. He made some cameras himself and manufactured an exposure meter called the Watkins Bee Meter due to its small size and efficiency. An example is in the Museum Resource & Learning Centre in Hereford. Another accompanied Robert Falcon Scott to the South Pole. Watkins was an active member of the Photographic Convention of the United Kingdom and served as its President when the Convention was held in Hereford in 1907. In 1910 he was awarded the Progress Medal of the Royal Photographic Society (RPS). Instituted in 1878, this medal recognizes any invention, research, publication or other contribution which has resulted in an important advance in the scientific or technological development of photography or imaging in the widest sense. It also carries with it Honorary Fellowship of the society.https://web.archive.org/web/20120822030453/http://www.rps.org/annual- awards/Progress-Medal Over 3,000 photographs, taken from Alfred's original glass negative plates are held by Hereford Library. In photography, Watkins began with a primitive pinhole camera made from a cigar box. He devised an \\"exposure meter\\" after exploring the mathematical relations of light, lens size and exposure period. He published findings in the April 1890 edition of the British Journal of Photography and patented his exposure meter. The Watkins Meter Company was active for over forty years and exported all over the world. The device contributed much to photography's emergence as a mass- market art form. His Watkins Manual of Exposure and Development (1900), ran to eleven editions. On 30 June 1921, Watkins visited Blackwardine in Herefordshire when he had the idea that there was a system of straight lines crossing the landscape dating from Neolithic times. He presented his ideas at a meeting of the Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club of Hereford in September 1921, and published his first books Early British Trackways in 1922 and The Old Straight Track in 1925. Thereafter he spent a major part of his life developing his theory. He published a further book on leys and participated in the Old Straight Track Club from 1927 to 1935. (Its papers are also in the Hereford City Museum.) Watkins was a member of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, an authority on beekeeping and a fellow of the Royal Photographic Society. He was also involved in the preservation of Pembridge, Herefordshire Market Hall. Legacy A blue plaque marking Watkins' home at Hereford, Herefordshire Archaeologists in general do not accept Watkins' ideas on leys. At first they regarded the ancient Britons as too primitive to have devised such an arrangement, but this is no longer the argument used against the existence of leys. More crucially, there are so many ancient features that finding some in approximate alignment is highly likely. Watkins was sensitive to such arguments and argued for caution. He also drew up a list according to which landscape features could be given values between ¼ and 1 point, five points or more being required as evidence of a ley. Watkins' work resurfaced in popularised form from the 1960s following the publication of John Michell's book The View over Atlantis in 1969. Michell merged Watkins' ideas with mystical concepts not present in Watkins' own work.

Biography Popp was born into a family of German-Dutch background, in Fontenay-le-Comte, Vendée. He started his career as a church organist, filling the place of the abbot who had been called up to serve in World War II in 1939. Popp studied music at the Saint Joseph Institute. In the 1950s he worked for the French radio station RTF, composing music for the Club d'Essai and, from 1953 to 1960, La Bride sur le cou. He orchestrated a number of Juliette Gréco albums in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In the 1960s, he co-wrote, with Pierre Cour, three songs for the Eurovision Song Contest: \\"Tom Pillibi\\", which won the competition for France when it was sung by 18-year-old newcomer Jacqueline Boyer in 1960, \\"Le chant de Mallory\\", the 1964 French entry, performed by another newcomer, Rachel, and \\"L'amour est bleu\\" (Love is Blue) which came fourth for Luxembourg in 1967, but which later became a number-one hit instrumental in the US for Paul Mauriat. Popp is the composer of Piccolo, Saxo et Compagnie, to a text by , a musical tale for children intended as a guide to the instruments of the orchestra and the rudiments of harmony. In 1957, Popp released Delirium in Hi- Fi (originally titled Elsa Popping et sa musique sidérante), a collaboration with Pierre Fatosme, an experiment in the recording techniques of the time. Popp is the author of the pop song \\"\\" sung by Marie Laforêt. Its melody gained fame in the former Soviet Union as the background music to the Vremya television news programme's weather forecast since the early 1970s. Popp made one-of-a-kind space-age instrumental recordings during the 1950s and by the early 1960s had built quite a good reputation in the music recording industry and was in demand as an arranger. He made orchestrations for Rive Gauche legend Juliette Gréco that were jazzy, urbane, vibrant, quirky, even cartoonish at times. The arrival of rock and roll in France and, consequentially, yé-yé music, dramatically changed the expectations of French audiences and record buyers, especially the younger ones, who were more interested in singers like Johnny Hallyday than Jacques Brel, although chansonniers such as Brel ultimately remained just as popular as they had been in the 1950s. Popp had to adapt to these new trends. He worked almost exclusively with female singers during this period, preferably the Lolita types, such as Chantal Goya, but also with Françoise Hardy. \\"Love is Blue\\", a song Vicky Leandros performed at the Eurovision Song Contest 1967 on behalf of Luxembourg, also recorded by Claudine Longet, became internationally popular. In these recordings, Popp does not sacrifice the sophistication of his 1950s orchestrations, but rather than animate the songs, he seems to set the tone, the mood, painting a colorful picture. Sometimes there are silky, smooth strings; often there is harpsichord and oboe and flute; elsewhere adventurous brassy fanfares; occasionally an ethereal soprano chorus; always some magical musical final touch, like the faint, quavering harmonica in \\"Manchester et Liverpool\\". Marie Laforêt's voice fit perfectly in André Popp's 1960s soundscapes and he created more of them for her than for her contemporaries. Popp died at his apartment in the Paris suburb of Puteaux on 10 May 2014, the very day that his last interview, with Benoît Duteurtre, was broadcast on France Musique.

Willoughby In England & Wales, it is a tort of strict liability.Kuwait Airways Corp. v. Iraq Airways Co. (No. 4,5,6) Its equivalents in criminal law include larceny or theft and criminal conversion. In those jurisdictions that recognise it, criminal conversion is a lesser crime than theft/larceny. Examples of conversion include: 1) Alpha cuts down and hauls away trees on land s/he knows is owned by Beta, without permission or privilege to do so; and 2) Gamma takes furniture belonging to Delta and puts it into storage, without Delta's consent (and especially if Delta does not know where Gamma put it). A common act of conversion in medieval times involved bolts of cloth that were bailed for safekeeping, which the bailee or a third party took and made clothes for their own use or for sale. Many questions concerning joint ownership in enterprises such as a partnership belong in equity, and do not rise to the level of a conversion. Traditionally, a conversion occurs when some chattel is lost, then found by another who appropriates it to his own use without legal authority to do so. It has also applied in cases where chattels were bailed for safekeeping, then misused or misappropriated by the bailee or a third party. Conversion, as a purely civil wrong, is distinguishable from both theft and unjust enrichment. Theft is obviously an act inconsistent with another's rights, and theft will also be conversion. But not all conversions are thefts because conversion requires no element of dishonesty. Conversion is also different from unjust enrichment. If one claims an unjust enrichment, the person who has another's property may always raise a change of position defense, to say they have unwittingly used up the assets they were transferred. For conversion, there always must be an element of voluntarily dealing with another's property, inconsistently with their rights. Elements of conversion The elements of conversion are: 1) Intent to convert the tangible or intangible property of another to one's own possession and use, 2) The property in question is subsequently converted.Hartford Financial Corp. v. Burns, 96 Cal. App.3d 591, 158 Cal. Rptr. 169, 27 U.C.C.R.S. 831Brown v. Meyer, Gebhart v. D. A. Davidson & Co., 18 Am. Jur.2d Conversion § 2 In another formulation, it has been stated that one claiming conversion must show a tortious conversion of the chattel, a right to property in it, and a right to immediate possession which is absolute, unconditional, and not dependent upon the performance of some act.Jenson v. Chicago & W. I. R. Co., 94 Ill. App.3d 915, 50 Ill Dec. 470, History of conversion Buildings, silos and machinery attached to them can be converted if they are removed from the land. Conversion has been described as a fascinating tort,Prosser and Keeton, p. 88 albeit one which has largely eluded the attention of legal writers. The literature frequently laps over into that of trover.See Note, 1935, 21 Cornell Law Quarterly 112 Other sources define conversion as a distinct act of dominion wrongfully exerted over another's personal property in denial of or inconsistent with his title or rights therein, or in derogation, exclusion, or defiance of such title or rights, without the owner's consent and without lawful justification.Quaker Oats Co. v. McKibben, Shartzer v. Ulmer, 85 Ariz. 179, De Vries v. Brumback, 53 Cal.2d 643, 2 Cal. Rptr. 764, , 51 A.L.R 146273 A.L.R. 792; 4 A.L.R.3d 1450; 18 Am. Jur. 2d § 1 A conversion occurs when a person does such acts in reference to the personal property of another as amount, in view of the law, to his appropriating the property for himself.Richstein v. Roesch, 71 S.D. 451, , 169 ALR 98 The action probably developed because there was no equivalent form of action in English law to the Roman law rei vindicatio. This was an action in protection of one's property, whereby a claimant could simply allege in court \\"that's mine!\\". Early cases of conversion are to be found in 1479, where reference to an even earlier action on the case is made when the defendant \\"converted\\" the goods by changing their character, making clothes out of gold cloth.Year Book 18 Edw. IV, f. 23. pl.5 1479 Otherwise, conversion had its origin in the common law action in trover, as a branch of action on the case. The earliest cases are most likely lost. These probably involved cases when the finder of lost goods did not return them to the rightful owner, but used them himself or disposed of them to someone else. It became necessary to invent a new writ which covered the gap between action in trespass which lay for the wrongful taking of a chattel, and detinue which lay for its wrongful detention. The claim in conversion had become standardized by 1554 in the case of Lord Mounteagle v Countess of Worcester , . The plaintiff was in possession of certain goods, he casually lost them, the defendant found the goods and did not return them, but instead \\"converted them to his own use.\\"Prosser and Keeton, p. 89 There is a distinction between trover and conversion. Trover resolved the old procedural problem of wager of law which had developed as a form of licensed perjury, which made detinue unattractive to an honest plaintiff suing a dishonest defendant. Wager at law allowed testimony from many witnesses, who might have nothing to do with the actual litigation. In this sense, it was not much different from champerty and maintenance. Because trover sidestepped these old problems, there was an effort to expand it into many different forms. The legal device to accomplish this at first was to treat the allegation of losing the goods and then finding them as a fiction. This method was seen in several cases in the 17th century.Gumbleton v Grafton , Kinaston v Moore , Ratliff v Davies , Isaack v Clark , As a technical factor, the defendant was not permitted to deny losing and finding, so the only issues to be litigated were those of the plaintiff's right to possession and the conversion as an existent fact. With losing and finding no longer essential, trover became the standard remedy for any form of interference with a chattel. It entirely replaced detinue, which fell into complete disuse. It replaced trespass to chattels to such an extent that the former was rarely seen. In 1756, Lord Mansfield stated in Cooper v Chitty ; : Similar results are seen in other cases from the time.John Williams, Note to Saunders's Reports, Wilbraham v. Snow , The two actions were regarded as alternative remedies for the same wrong. Often, the plaintiff had a choice of action, although there were differences between the choices. Trover must involve a wrongful detention of goods which had not been wrongfully taken, while trespass would not.Put and Hardy v Rawsterne , The theory of trespass was that the plaintiff remained the owner of the chattel, with his possession only interrupted or interfered with, so that when it was tendered back to the plaintiff, he must accept it. The damages must be limited to the loss of use, which could be considerably less than its total value. Trover, which involved lost goods or those placed in a bailment, necessitated full replacement damages. Once the damages were paid, the ownership of the chattel passed to the defendant in trover. The modern law of conversion crystallised after the case of Fouldes v Willoughby , . Two horses owned by the plaintiff were placed on a river ferry. The horses were put back on the shore by the defendant ferryman. The plaintiff/owner of the horses remained on the ferry and subsequently lost the horses. It was held that this was a trespass, but not a conversion, since there was no interference with the plaintiff's \\"general right of domination\\" over the horses. Property subject to conversion In order for a conversion to occur, it used to need to be lost then found by some other person than the owner. In the process, it was possible that the property could be converted.Ayers v. French 1874, 41 Conn. 142 Chattels converted have included a dog,Graham v. Smith, 1897, 100 Ga. 434, moneyState v. Omaha National Bank, 1899, 59 Neb. 483, and tax receipts.Vaughn v. Wright, 1913, 139 Ga. 736, Land could not be the subject of an action in trover, since it could not be lost, then found and converted. The same was true for sand and gravel, timber, crops and fixtures, so long as they were considered as a part of the land. No action in trover could be had. Once there was severance from the land, these became personal property, and trover could be entertained because of removal from the land.Cage Bros. v. Whiteman, 1942, 139 Tex. 522, Palumbo v. Harry M. Quinn, Inc. 1944, 323 Ill. App. 404, Luhmann v. Shaefer, Mo. App. 1940, Pettigew v. W. & H. Development Co., Fla. App. 1960, Giuliano Construction Co. v.

Grogan Builders Supply Co. Tex. Civ. App. 1983, =Tangible and intangible property= The conception that an action for conversion lies only for tangible property capable of being identified and taken into actual possession is based on a fiction by which the action of trover was founded, namely, that the defendant had found the property of another, which was lost. This conception has become, in the progress of the law, something without meaning which has been discarded by most courts.Payne v. Elliot, 54 Cal. 339, 44 A.L.R.2d 92718 Am. Jur.2d Conversion § 7 Therefore, it has been generally accepted that an action for conversion lies for every species of personal property which is the subject of private ownership, whether animate or inanimate.Hooten v.

Cohen, , when the domain name sex.com was wrongfully transferred to a con man, a claim for conversion was held to be available against the domain name registrar.

Allan held intangible property cannot be the subject of a claim for conversion. =Written instruments= Stock certificates, bonds and commercial paper can be the subject of an action in conversion A judgment that is in the nature of a debt of record, but has neither goods nor a chattel attached is not subject to a conversion, because the judgment creditor has no property in it.Platt v.

Fassett, 21 Vt. 53944 A.L.R.2d 927 § 15 Unpublished and published manuscripts, whether copyrighted or not can be the subject of a conversion, as can paintings, pictures, photos, letters, business books, pamphlets, newspapers and the like.MacGregor v.

Jur. 2d Conversion § 14 =Real estate and property affixed thereto= The general rule is that an action for conversion lies only with respect to personal property, and cannot apply to real estate.Rowe v. Burrup, 95 Id. 747, Eadus v. Hunter, 268 Mich. 233,  \\"movables\\"  The distinction between \\"movables\\" (not associated in any way with real estate as such nor necessary to its enjoyment) and \\"immovables\\" (such as buildings and often including spare parts or even potentially but not usually mobile tools or devices or systems) arises from the principle of lex situs, by which the governing law for immovables is that where the land is located, regardless of where a will is probated or contract made or executed. There are distinctions made between monetary claim on land and land itself, often with different limitations. However, these distinctions determine jurisdiction, rather than define how to resolve the conversion or possession issue. The fact that personal property is annexed to realty after its conversion usually does not prevent the maintenance of an action for the conversion, although opinion on this subject remains mixed (in part due to conflits of laws between movables and immovables on the same lot). Actions for conversion of a building, machinery attached to a building or a grain elevator have been allowed.Dawson & Young v. Powell, 72 Ky. 663Russell v. Richards, 11 Me. 371Hardie v. Peterson, 86 Mont. 150, Bynum v. Gay, 161 Ala. 140, , 4 A.L.R.2d 790 Severance of property from real estate can be converted.Peiser v.

Moore, N.H. 533, There is no simple general rule dividing personal vs. real property. Land itself cannot be converted or \\"stolen\\" by possession. Rather, common law recognizes and rewards adverse possession as a form of undocumented ownership of neglected land (which becomes documented when it is challenged or registered by deed or survey or otherwise), suits for trespass or ejection from land against which deeded rights are grounds or defense.

Cerri, 96 Nev. 352, Fraudulent intent is not an element of conversion.Baker v. Rangos, 229 Pa. Super. 333, The defendant is answerable for the conversion, no matter how good his intentions were, or how careful he has been, or how apparently well-founded was his belief that his tortious act was right.54 A.L.R. 132842 A.L.R. 128Baer v. Slater, 261 Mass. 153, The existence of probable cause does not preclude liability.34 A.L.R. 721 A person may be liable for conversion even though he was reasonably mistaken in thinking the facts to be such as would give him a legal right to the goods.Row v. Home Sav. Bank, 306 Mass. 522, 131 A.L.R. 160 There are cases in which the defendant does not clearly appropriate the property to his own use, and in which the question whether there is a conversion therefore depends on the intent of the defendant either express or implied.Cheminshaw v. Meehan 236 App.Div. 185, 258 N.Y.S. 225Lund v. Keeper, 203 Wis. 458, Towns v. Pratt, 33 N.H. 345New York Life Ins. Co. v. Bank of Commerce & Trust Co. 172 Tenn. 226, 115 A.L.R. 643Rogers v. Huie, 2 Cal. 57118 Am. Jur. 2d Conversion § 3 =In general= Trees cannot be converted, but lumber, severed from the land can be. Conversion, being a wrongful act, cannot spring from the exercise of a legal right. Such acts include the right of execution on a legal judgment or contesting rights under a contract.Owens v. Zippy Mart of South Carolina, Inc. 268 S.C. 383, Commercial Credit Equipment Corp. v. People's Loan Service, Inc., The general rule is that there is no conversion until some act is done which is a denial or violation of the plaintiff's dominion over or rights in the property. To constitute a conversion of a chattel, there must be an unauthorized assumption of the right to possession or ownership. The act must have the essence of a tort.4 A.L.R. 119295 A.L.R. 608Jensen v. Chicago & W. I. R. Co., 94 Ill.App.3d 915, 50 Ill.Dec 470, =Depriving owner of possession= The exercise of ownership over property may take a number of forms. All that is required is that the defendant exercise control over the chattel in a manner inconsistent with the plaintiff's right of possession. The gist of a conversion is not the acquisition of the property by the wrongdoer, but the wrongful deprivation of another's property which the owner is entitled to possess.18 Am. Jur. 2d Conversion §§ 28-32 =Receipt of property= A person who accepts the possession of personal property from one not authorized to transfer it may be regarded as a converter.Warner v. Martin, 52 U.S. 209, 13 L. Ed. 667 The Restatement (Second) of Torts is in accord with this concept, stating that one who receives possession of a chattel from another with the intent to acquire for himself or a third person a proprietary interest in the chattel which the other has not the power to transfer is subject to liability for conversion to a third person then entitled to the immediate possession of the chattel.Restatement (Second) of Torts § 229 =Disposal of property= An action for conversion may be predicated upon an improper disposal, removal, transportation, delivery, or transfer of possession of property to one not authorized by the owner to receive the property.Bell v. Carter The Restatement (Second) of Torts states that, with some exceptions, one who makes an unauthorized delivery of a chattel to a person not entitled to its immediate possession is subject to liability for conversion to another who is so entitled.Restatement (Second) of Torts § 235(1) A bailee, agent, or servant who re-delivers to his bailor, principal, or master is not liable for conversion unless the person entitled to immediate possession had made an adverse claim upon him.Restatement (Second) of Torts § 235(2) A bailee, agent or servant who delivers the chattel to a third person pursuant to the instructions of his bailor, principal or master is not liable for conversion unless he has knowledge or reason to know that his bailor, principal, or master is not authorized so to dispose of it.Restatement (Second) of Torts § 235 =Detention or refusal to surrender possession= A sea container and its contents, lost, found and not returned to its rightful owner can be both a conversion and a crime. A common conversion is a refusal to surrender possession of the chattel to one who is entitled to it. Normally, this is judged to be a sufficiently serious interference with the plaintiff's right of control.Prosser and Keeton, p. 98 If the detention is small or not deemed to be serious, it will not be considered a conversion. A garage which delays delivery of an automobile for 30 minutes does not commit a conversion.Matice v. Brinkman, 1889, 74 Mich. 705, 42 N. W. 172Peck v. Patterson, 1956, 119 Vt. 280, 125 A 2d 813 The same is true of a stock certificate.Daggett v. Davis, 1884, 53 Mich. 35, Placing furniture or other goods in storage to prevent damage or theft is also not a conversion, per se, if proper notice of its location is given to the owner.Poor v. Oakman, 1870, 104 Mass. 309Edinburg v. Allen Squire Co., 1938, 299 Mass. 206, Zaslow v. Kroenert, 29 Cal. 2d. 451, If the delay is long, or intentional, it is a conversion. Holding an automobile for a month is a conversion.Thomas v. Westbrook, 1944, 206 Ark. 841, Kirby v. Porter, 1923, 144 Md. 261, Jones v. Stone, 1917, 78 N. H. 504, Henderson v. Beggs, Tex. Civ. App. 1918, Goods placed in storage or in bailment destroyed by fire are considered to have been converted.Donnell v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. 1912, 109 Me. 500, In 1704, it was stated in Baldwin v Cole: =Wrongful use, loss or injury= The use of or intermeddling (a term usually applicable to estate law) with the property of another has often been held to constitute a conversion, whether the act is done by one who had no authority to use the property, or by one who has authority to use the property but uses it in an unauthorized way. Any unjustified exercise of dominion over property by one who is not the owner nor entitled to possession which interferes with the right of possession of another who is lawfully entitled thereto constitutes a conversion. According to the Restatement (Second) of Torts, one who uses a chattel in a manner which is a serious violation of the right of another to control its use is subject to liability to the other for conversion.Restatement (Second) of Torts § 22717 A.L.R.2d 128920 A.L.R. 37451 A.L.R. 1462 A conversion may be predicated upon destruction of personal property.73 A.L.R. 792Greer v. Carl Johnson Motor Co., 269 Ala. 617, An action for conversion may lie for killing an animalAmerican Surety Co. of New York v. Baker, 172 F.2d 689 (4th Cir. 1949) (where plaintiff had knowledge that hogs allegedly converted had been killed and the products of the hogs sold, it was not necessary for plaintiff to make a futile demand for the hogs in order to establish a conversion). or rendering a musical instrument useless.1 A.L.R. 1648 Persons entitled to bring action An agent entrusted by a principal with the possession of goods is generally recognized as having a sufficient interest in the goods to enable him to maintain an action against a third person for a conversion. Some jurisdictions hold that the agent must have more than a mere right of possession. A similar result has been reached where the servant left the property in the possession of the defendant, who subsequently converted it. Where a sheriff attached chattels and delivered them for safekeeping to a person, the person was merely the sheriff's servant, and having no interest in the chattels, could not maintain an action for their conversion.Ludden v. Leavitt, 9 Mass. 104Gunzburger v. Rosenthal, 226 Pa. 300, Tuthill v. Wheeler, 6 Barb.(N.Y.) 362 Causes of action for conversion are generally assignable, so that the action may be instituted by the assignee. An officer in possession of property may ignore a conversion of the same by a wrongdoer and proceed to sell the property on execution, the purchaser then being permitted to sue the wrongdoer for the conversion of the property.Jewett v. Patridge, 12 Me. 243 A transferee of personal property, or interest therein, who acquires the right of possession by or through the transfer, may maintain an action for a conversion committed after the transfer, though he has not yet received actual possession of the goods.44 A.L.R. 435 A creditor, having no interest, generally may not be a plaintiff in an action to retrieve a debtor's converted property.Quaker Oats Co. v. McKibben, An owner of land may bring an action in conversion, but he must be in material possession of the land and of the property severed from the land at the time of the conversion.White v. Yawkey, 108 Ala. 270, Persons subject to action Furniture and clothing placed into storage without a notice to the owner, and subsequently destroyed in a warehouse fire has been ruled to be a conversion.McCurdy v. Walblom Furniture & Carpet Co. 84 Minn. 326, The owner of a partial interest in property may be liable for converting the same, where he wrongfully takes it out of the possession of another, or does some other act amounting to a conversion.18 Am. Jur.2d Conversion §§ 67, 81 The following are the typical defendants in an action in conversion: * Fraudulent takers and their transferees * Owner as possessor of land * Persons aiding and/or abetting in conversion * Public officers * An agent, even if he acts in good faith and in accordance with his instructions, if the principal is guilty of conversion * The principal when his agent's act of converting the property is committed within the scope of the agency * The owner of the property if he diminishes its value or sells or destroys it to the damage of a lienholder Conditions precedent to recovery In order to maintain an action for conversion, the plaintiff must have an interest in the thing converted. He must recover on the strength of his own title, without regard to the weakness of that of his adversary. It is necessary that the plaintiff be the owner of the property claimed to be converted, or that he be in possession or entitled to possession at the time of the alleged conversion. Absolute and unqualified title is sufficient, but it is not necessary. A mere right of possession is generally regarded as an interest sufficient to maintain an action.18 Am. Jur.2d Conversion §§ 75-73 A.L.R.2d 218 § 6 =Interest in property= An action for conversion may be maintained by persons having the immediate right of possession of the article converted.McKee v. Gratz, 260 U.S. 127, 67 L. Ed. 167, 43 S. Ct. In order for a plaintiff to recover in a suit for conversion, it is necessary that the plaintiff establish a right to the property and what is converted.Groves v. Hanks, An immediate right to possession at the time of conversion is usually all that is required in the way of title or possession to enable the plaintiff to maintain an action.Kennett v. Peters, 54 Kan. 119, The possession of personal property carries with it the presumption of title, and enables the possessor to maintain an action for conversion against any person except the rightful owner.Carey v. Cyr 150 Me. 405, As against a stranger with no possession rights, mere possession alone is good enough, and in such a case, the plaintiff need prove no more than possession. Generally, a peaceable possession of land, even though wrongful, is a sufficient interest on which to base an action for conversion against a trespasser upon the land who severs property from the soil as part of the trespass, although neither party has title to the land or the property severed therefrom.Omaha & Grant Smelting & Refining Co. v. Tabor, 13 Colo. 41, Hoffman v. Harrington, 44 Mich. 183, =Tender of debt due defendant= Where a tender of a debt due the defendant is necessary to entitle the plaintiff to the immediate possession of the property, such tender is necessary to entitle him to maintain the action for conversion. This is because an action for conversion cannot be maintained unless the plaintiff, at the time of the alleged conversion, was entitled to the immediate possession of the specific property that is the subject of the conversion.Cumnock v. Institution for Sav., 142 Mass. 342, Truscott v. Garner, 92 Ga. App. 95, A tender is not required where it is no longer within the power of the defendant to perform his part of the agreement out of which the debt arose.Alcolea v. Smith, 150 La. 482, 24 A.L.R. 815 =Demand= Some jurisdictions require a demand and refusal to be necessary to constitute a conversion and to maintain a subsequent action for conversion. The usual rule is that demand and refusal are never necessary, except to furnish evidence of the conversion. Without these, when the circumstances (circumstantial evidence) are sufficient to prove the conversion, demand and refusal are superfluous.61 A.L.R. 61597 A.L.R.2d 990 In those jurisdictions requiring a demand and refusal, there is no specific form the demand must take.Molski v. Bendza, 116 Conn. 710, In cases where stolen property ends up in the hands of a third party, demand may be necessary to put the third party on notice that the property has been stolen.Gurney v. Kenny, 2 ED Smith 132 Defenses In a conversion suit, it is no defense to claim that the defendant was not negligent or that the defendant acquired the plaintiff's property through the plaintiff's unilateral mistake, or that the defendant acted in complete innocence and perfect good faith.Ligon v. E. F. Hutton & Co., The following are traditional defenses to an action in conversion: * Abandonment. Abandonment of the property before it was taken by the defendant is a complete defense.Rodgers v. Crum, 168 Kan. 668, * Authority of law. A conversion cannot occur if it is done by authority of law, a court order or valid process.Restatement (Second) of Torts § 265 * Consent or approbation. Consent by the plaintiff can be either express or implied.Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 252-253, 255-256 * Delay in bringing action. Statutes of limitations are defined by legislative jurisdiction. Some cases are based on \\"reasonable knowledge\\". Paintings purchased from a third person became the subject of an action in conversion, even though the incident had occurred 30 years prior. The action accrued based on when the plaintiff reasonably knew or should have known the identity of the possessor of the converted paintings.O'Keeffe v. Snyder, 83 N.J. 478, See also the doctrine of laches. * Fraud of the plaintiff. Conveying property to a third person for purposes of evading creditors is a complete defense to a subsequent action in conversion.37 Am. Jur.2d Fraudulent Conveyances § 148 * Interest of defendant. If the defendant has ownership or partial ownership to the property, it cannot be converted. Cases revolve around the specific facts concerning ownership.100 A.L.R. 1370 * Value of property. A provisional defense can be made if the property converted has no value. Nevertheless, it is well established that it is not necessary for property to have a commercial value in order to maintain an action in conversion. This argument can be used to mitigate damages. * Writings. A bill or debt obligation can be converted. However, if it has been paid or otherwise satisfied, then it has neither value nor existence in the eyes of the court.44 A.L.R.2d 927 § 4[b], [c] * Nonexistence or lack of identity of property. Something that was not in existence at the time of the alleged conversion cannot be converted.40 A.L.R. 377 * Privilege. Finders of lost property may be entitled to use or ownership if the real owner cannot be identified. This is an overlap into the rules of trover.132 A.L.R. 61344 A.L.R.2d 927 § 7[a] * Unlawful and illegal acts. Unlawful contracts, illegal ownership and illegal activities on the part of the plaintiff can be a defense to an action in conversion. A counterfeit coin cannot be converted, nor can a note issued in an illegal manner. * Waiver, ratification and estoppel. An action in conversion can be dismissed if the right to treat the action has been waived by the plaintiff.41 A.L.R.2d 657 * By receipt of proceeds of a sale. Accepting the proceeds of a sale of the converted property is a defense against further action.2 A.L.R.2d 218 § 5 * By accepting return of goods. Once the owner accepts the converted property back, he or she is generally precluded from any further action.3 A.L.R.2d 218 Damages=In general= The remedy for conversion is usually in the form of damages equal to the fair market value of the chattel at the time of conversion.79 A.L.R.2d 66821 A.L.R.2d 380 § 4 The converter can offer to return possession of the chattel to the complainant, but the complainant is not obligated to accept. If the complainant wants the chattel returned without any additional monetary damages, they can claim a related tort, detinue. One may use force in order to recover a chattel only if the wrongdoer is either in the process of taking the chattel or the owner of the chattel is in \\"hot pursuit\\" of the chattel. This is because a victim of conversion should use the legal remedies available as opposed to \\"self-help\\" or violence. Deadly force may never be used in the recovery of chattels. The exact measure of compensation due to a plaintiff whose goods have been wrongfully converted may be merely nominal if the wrong is technical and the defendant can return the goods; it may be limited to the actual damage where the goods can be returned, but the wrong is substantial; but in ordinary cases it is the full value to the owner of the goods of which he has been deprived. =Special damages= When the conversion occurs, the injured party should receive full compensation for actual losses. Special damages may be recovered in an action for conversion for any injury proximately resulting from the conversion. The Restatement (Second) of Torts indicates these damages can consist of:Restatement (Second) of Torts § 927(2) * the additional value of a chattel due to additions or improvements made by the converter not in good faith. * the amount of any further pecuniary loss of which the deprivation has been a legal cause. * interest from the time at which the value was fixed. * compensation for the loss of use not otherwise compensated. It is a generally recognized rule that interest lost from the conversion is recoverable. Loss of rental value can be considered as interest.36 A.L.R.2d 337 §§ 23[1], 26[a] =Mitigation= The defendant is allowed to show the existence of facts which would make it unjust to allow the plaintiff to recover full value. Ordinarily, the defendant is not allowed to deduct maintenance and upkeep expenses which would normally accrue taking care of the converted property. Return of the property with acceptance by the owner can dismiss the action, or be used as a mitigating fact. However, the mere offering of the converted property does not necessarily dismiss all damages which may have occurred based on the original tort. Action under legal process can be a complete defense and can mitigate damages.18 Am. Jur.2d Conversions §§ 124-133 =Measure for converting particular kinds of property= Damages for conversion of grains, corn and cotton are based on market value, plus any accrual or interest gained. There are certain cases which require special calculation of damages. * Commodities. Stock certificates or bonds which have increased in value after conversion. Recovery is permitted for the increased value. This rule can be applied to other kinds of property, such as cotton and corn.40 A.L.R. 1279 * Business enterprise. The proper measure of damages for a business enterprise is the value at the time of the conversion.In re Estate of Corbin, , (Fla.3d DCA. 1980) * Commercial paper. Damages are generally the value at the time of conversion plus accrued interest.85 A.L.R.2d 1349 § 2 [a], [d] * Insurance policies. Similar to other choses of action. Damage is based on value at the time of conversion, less the value of premiums to be paid after the conversion, and value based on life expectancy.Barney v. Dudley, 42 Kan. 212, * Corporate stock. Damages based on market value, lost dividends and accrual or loss of value, considering lost chance to sell stock at a profit.31 A.L.R.3d 1286 * Property severed from real estate. Damages measured based on market value and interest.21 A.L.R.2d 371, § 5 * Property of no market value or held for personal use. Items such as personal mementos, writings, personal diaries, plans, portraits, photographs, memoirs and the like, which have no intrinsic market value pose a difficulty. Usually the court will try to develop a method to arrive at a reasonable value for such an item. Results vary based on the facts of the case.22 Am Jur.2d Damages §§ 149, 150 Practice and procedure in the United States=In general= The first question in an action for conversion is that of venue and jurisdiction. Mere questions of ownership within partnerships and some contract law do not arise to the level required for an action in conversion. These are matters best settled in a suit in equity with a determination of equity on the case.St. Louis & S. F. R. Co. v. Georgia, F. & A. R. Co., 213 Ala. 108, 77 Am. Jur.2d Venue § 19 A true conversion is strictly a legal case.Mitchell v. Georgia & A. R. Co., 111 Ga. 760, In general, relief through an action in conversion can proceed, even if other potential remedies have not been exhausted. However, once the action in conversion is commenced, the plaintiff may be precluded from seeking concurrent remedies.25 Am. Jur.2d Election of Remedies § 10 Other concurrent remedies typically are: * Action to recover possession which may include trover, detinue and replevin, which are now statutorily defined and vary between jurisdictions. * Assumpsit * Criminal proceedings Joinder of parties can usually be allowed. Successive converters need not be named in an action in conversion.18 Am. Jur.2d Conversion §§ 143-9 =Pleading by plaintiff= The facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for conversion must be set forth in the complaint or declaration, so as to show that the plaintiff has a right to maintain an action. The typical pleading should include:18 Am. Jur.2d Conversion §§ 150-7 * Jurisdictional facts. * Identification of the defendant. * Diversity of citizenship and amount in controversy (required for entry into federal court). * Proof of title or right of possession of the property. * Description of the property. * Value of the property. * Facts constituting the alleged conversion by the defendant. * Demand and refusal for a return of the property from the defendant. *Damages sustained by the plaintiff. =Answer of defendant= In general, the defendant should answer the charge of conversion by asserting:18 Am. Jur.2d Conversion §§ 158-6261 Am. Jur.2d Pleading § 139 * Matters intending to prove the establishment of the defendant's affirmative defenses. * Plaintiff's consent to the defendant's taking (if it exists, can be proved or inferred by circumstantial evidence). * Defendant's rights to the property are superior to those of the plaintiff. * Plaintiff had waived the right to the property or to a subsequent cause of action. * Plaintiff was estopped from asserting any right to the property as against the defendant. * The property was abandoned. * Alleging mistake, or other mitigating circumstance - assertion that the plaintiff has not tried to facilitate defendant's attempts to resolve the issue or mitigate damages. =Evidence= In an action for conversion, as with all tort cases, witness testimony is important to establish the facts. Rules of evidence are no different in an action for conversion than any other tort case. The burden is on the plaintiff to establish the case. The following areas are generally necessary to be established:18 Am. Jur.2d Conversion §§ 163-77 * Plaintiff's interest in the property. * Identity of the property. * Value of the property. * Identification of the defendant. * The defendant exercised dominion over the property. * The defendant's exercise of dominion was intentionally committed. These are established through testimony and documentary evidence. =Verdict and judgment= An action in conversion is for the monetary value of the property and not the property itself. A judgment which requires either monetary damages or return of the property is not, per se, erroneous. A verdict demanding only the return of property is reversible error. It is within the discretion of the trier of fact to determine actual value, which may be different from that of market value, testimony or documentary evidence. A judgment is for the title and ownership of the property at the time of the conversion, and does not necessarily effect subsequent transactions which may have occurred.98 A.L.R. 6893 A.L.R.2d 21418 Am. Jur.2d Conversion §§ 178-80 Conversion and crime Conversion is an interference with another's ownership of property. It is a general intent tort, not a specific intent tort. That means that the intent to take or otherwise deal with the property is enough to support the claim, and it doesn't matter whether the defendant knew that the act would constitute interference with the property of another. Therefore, the defendant's innocent reasons for the act cannot be used as an excuse. It does not matter if the defendant made a mistake. The standard remedy for conversion is a judgment for damages in an amount equal to the fair market value of the property. Punitive damages are also possible, because conversion is an intentional tort. The standard remedy in a detinue action is an order that the property be returned. The standard remedy in an action for trespass to chattels is a judgment for an amount equal to the value of loss of use of the property. Damages from a trespass claim are based on the harm caused to the plaintiff, rather than the value of the chattel. Many actions can constitute both conversion and trespass. In these cases, a plaintiff must eventually choose which claim to press based on what damages they seek to recover. It is the difference between forcing a rental fee and a total sale upon a defendant. In some cases the exercise of the dominion may amount to an act of trespass or to a crime, e.g. where the taking amounts to larceny, or fraudulent appropriation by a bailee or agent entrusted with the property of another (Larceny Acts of 1861 and 1901). Fraudulent conversion by any person to his own use (or that of persons other than the owner) of property entrusted to him is a crime in the case of custodians of property, factors, trustees under express trusts in writing (Larceny Act 1861, ss. 77-85; Larceny Act 1901).

It passes through the numerous popular tourist areas including Surfers Paradise and Broadbeach, a commercial centre at Southport, residential areas, shopping centres and the Gold Coast (Coolangatta) Airport. It is characterised by a variety of urban landscapes, ranging from: * high-density high rises between Southport and Broadbeach * low rise apartments in Palm Beach and Bilinga * low-rise residential areas at Miami, Tugun and Labrador * shopping at Southport and Broadbeach * entertainment precincts at Broadbeach and Surfers Paradise * historic motels at Mermaid Beach * light industry at Arundel * native bushland at Coombabah Lake wetlands, Burleigh Head National Park and Currumbin Hill * parklands, sport and recreation at the Southport Broadwater Parklands and many smaller reserves * coastal views at Currumbin Creek The highest point of the highway is 42 metres at Currumbin Hill. History Pacific Highway in Surfers Paradise in 1952. Gold Coast Highway has been around since at least 1966, based on a page from a 1966 street directory. The section between Tweed Heads and Currumbin used to be part of the Pacific Highway, including the New South Wales section (renamed in May 2009), which was bypassed due to opening of Tugun Bypass the previous year. The Tugun Bypass is part of the Pacific Motorway, a motorway which runs parallel to the Gold Coast Highway. Road conditions Northbound towards Beach Road, Surfers Paradise The highway is divided along the entire length, mostly with four lanes. There are some six lane segments (often as bus lanes). It is also predominately well lit at night, with a few exceptions such as Currumbin and Burleigh Heads. Median fencing to prevent pedestrians crossing has also been introduced in areas such as Mermaid Beach. The highway at Surfers Paradise is subject to congestion during events, notably during the Gold Coast 600 held each October when part of the highway becomes part of the Surfers Paradise Street Circuit at Paradise Waters. The highway width is reduced to two lanes (one carriageway) and the speed limit reduced to 40 km/h. Projects and improvements 1\\\\. Labrador: Between Government Road and North Street, along a section mostly called Frank Street. The Highway was upgraded from a single carriageway to a divided 4 lane highway. A new bridge with a 4 lane crossing has been completed across Loders Creek in 2007. The road upgrade resulted in a thoroughfare similar to that in Surfers Paradise, with a narrow median and narrow road reserve due to limited space and to minimise property resumptions. One of the two lanes in each direction was initially designated a transit lane (buses and vehicles with 2 or more occupants), but this designation was removed in 2013. Bridge over Tallebudgera Creek 2\\\\. Broadbeach to Miami: Bus lanes will be added along the route as well as changes to bus stops, u-turns, traffic lights, signs, lighting and the median strip. The first phase (Alexandra Avenue to Hilda Street) was finished in mid September 2008. The second phase (Hilda Street to Chairlift Avenue) was largely completed in July 2009. 3\\\\. Tugun: The most notorious bottle-neck was at Tugun, where the Gold Coast Highway joins the Pacific Highway north of Coolangatta has been eliminated with the opening of the Tugun Bypass in June 2008. Some minor changes and improvements near Stewart Road in Tugun have coincided with the completion of the bypass to deal with the changed traffic flow. Public transport Gold Coast Highway looking south near Birt Ave with Sun City building on the left. Image taken in 2007, before the upgrade. This section of the highway is now 2 lanes each way. =Bus= Bus services throughout the area are operated by Surfside Buslines. Route 700 operates along the highway between Broadbeach South and Tweed Heads. On Sunday to Thursday nights it continues north of Broadbeach South to the Gold Coast University Hospital. It is the only 24-hour bus route in Australia. It is complemented by limited stops route 777 from Broadbeach South to Gold Coast Airport.Route 700 timetable TransLink 21 July 2014Route 777 timetable TransLink 21 July 2014 Bus Lanes are in place along some sections of the highway, particularly Broadbeach to Mermaid Beach and Miami. =Light Rail= The G:link light rail line opened in July 2014 between Gold Coast University Hospital and Broadbeach South. It has its own reservation to the west of the Gold Coast Highway from Southport to Surfers Paradise, from where it diverges onto Surfers Paradise Boulevard. It then rejoins the Gold Coast Highway at the south end of Surfers Paradise proceeding via a reservation in the median strip to Broadbeach North before crossing again to the western side to terminate at Broadbeach South. The northern extension to Helensvale opened in December 2017. =Railway= Helensvale railway station is located near the northern end of the highway. It is on the Gold Coast railway line with services operating frequently along the electrified line between Brisbane and Varsity Lakes. =Air= Gold Coast Airport is located at the southern end of the highway. It has frequent flights to Sydney and Melbourne as well as international services to New Zealand, Japan and South-East Asia. Major intersections The road is in the Gold Coast local government area, with the exception of the last 1 km, which is in the New South Wales LGA of Tweed Shire. Trivia * Musician David Grohl was famously arrested in a northern Surfers Paradise section of the Gold Coast Highway after electing to drunkenly ride back to his band's Marriott hotel on a rented moped scooter following the Foo Fighters' performance at the Big Day Out in January 2000.

It occupies an area of 25.32 square kilometres (6,330 acres). It is a natural environment-class Provincial Park created to help preserve oak savannah and the beach dune ecology. It has 1,275 sites of which 404 have electrical hookups. These include the Yurt camping area and the group camping sites. The initial package of land for the park was purchased from the Canada Company in 1957. In 1966, the park saw a 433-acre addition, adding 200 campsites to the park's existing 1,075 to accommodate the growth of the park patronage, which had reached peaks of 1,500 campers per day, causing many to be packed into overflow areas. Visitors to Pinery Provincial Park may access free wireless internet at the Visitor Centre provided by the Friends of Pinery Park . Facilities=Park office= The park office is located on Ontario Highway 21 south of Grand Bend. The park is open all year round. Senior staff, including the superintendent, can be reached at the park office between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. during summer months. The office is open from 8:00 a.m. until 9:00 p.m. There is a sub-office for the Riverside Campground that is open during peak arrival times. =Campgrounds= The forest in the park Riverside Riverside campground is located beside the Old Ausable Channel. It is the largest of the Pinery campgrounds. This campground is open all year round. There are a large number of electrical and pull through sites for RVs and motorhomes. Permits are obtained at the park gatehouse. Firewood is available for purchase at the gatehouse and from the Hosts at posted hours. Burley This area is open from May to September. It is the farthest from the main gate. It contains the smaller, more secluded sites within a short walk to the beach. These are camping sites that do not have electricity or pull-through site capabilities. Dunes This area is open from May to October. The sites are within easy walking distance to the beach, the outdoor amphitheatre and visitor centre. Dunes campground provides a mixture of electrical and tenting sites. Group campgrounds There are three group camping areas. The ten sites each accommodate up to 35 people. Water taps and vault toilets are on site. The sites are located near the beaches but are not adjacent to the comfort stations. Yurts Twelve yurts are located in Area 1 of the Riverside campground. These yurts are wheelchair accessible. Each \\"Yurt\\" includes bunks for sleeping 6 people, table and chairs, electric lighting and a heater. Also included are a propane gas barbecue and picnic shelter. These special sites are in high demand in all seasons. Ecology Dunes Beach in the Pinery along Lake Huron The park features the largest area of Oak Savanna in Ontario. To preserve this habitat, a population control program for White-tailed Deer has been implemented. During the early 1960s, because the value of the native savanna was not recognised, large numbers of Red and White pine trees were planted in the park, displacing the native vegetation. That is also how the park got its name. The Old Ausable Channel is a wide, slow-moving river which flows through the park. It was separated from the main Ausable River when two channels were excavated at Port Franks and Grand Bend at the end of the 19th century. Juniper trees growing in the dunes are constantly shifting with the sands. Fallen junipers are eventually re- buried, with main branches becoming new trees, so that distant trees are genetically identical, and sometimes still connected below ground. The oak trees are also critical to this habitat. Oaks are one of the few trees that will share the water it draws from deep underground with the surface plants that surround it, a critical element in this dry sandy ecosystem. Many of the plant species in the park depend on fire to reproduce. In recent years controlled burning has been attempted to try and restore some of the original flora and fauna. To ensure that the water at public beaches is safe for swimming, the Community Health Services Department regularly conducts sampling for beach water quality. Ontario beaches are posted with warnings of possible health risks when elevated E. coli levels are detected. Storm water runoff, combined with sewer overflows, sewage treatment plant by-passes, agricultural runoff, faulty septic systems, and large populations of waterfowl which colonize a beach or the surrounding area all contribute to water pollution which can result in beach postings.

In Buddhism, it refers to the five aggregates of clinging (Pañcupādānakkhandhā), the five material and mental factors that take part in the rise of craving and clinging. They are also explained as the five factors that constitute and explain a sentient being’s person and personality, but this is a later interpretation in response to sarvastivadin essentialism. The five aggregates or heaps are: form (or material image, impression) (rupa), sensations (or feelings, received from form) (vedana), perceptions (samjna), mental activity or formations (sankhara), and consciousness (vijnana).Skandha Encyclopædia Britannica (2013) In the Theravada tradition, suffering arises when one identifies with or clings to the aggregates. This suffering is extinguished by relinquishing attachments to aggregates. The Mahayana tradition asserts that the nature of all aggregates is intrinsically empty of independent existence. An approximate concept in Western philosophy is David Hume's Bundle theory, but it also differs significantly from it in detail and intention. Etymology Skandha (स्कन्ध) is a Sanskrit word that means \\"multitude, quantity, aggregate\\", generally in the context of body, trunk, stem, empirically observed gross object or anything of bulk verifiable with senses. The term appears in the Vedic literature. The Pali equivalent word Khandha (sometimes spelled Kkhanda) appears extensively in the Pali canon where, state Rhys Davids and William Stede, it means \\"bulk of the body, aggregate, heap, material collected into bulk\\" in one context, \\"all that is comprised under, groupings\\" in some contexts, and particularly as \\"the elements or substrata of sensory existence, sensorial aggregates which condition the appearance of life in any form\\". Paul Williams et al. translate skandha as \\"heap, aggregate\\", stating it refers to the explanation of the psychophysical makeup of any being. Johannes Bronkhorst renders skandha as \\"aggregates.\\" Damien Keown and Charles Prebish state that skandha is phung po in Tibetan, and the terms mean \\"collections or aggregates or bundles.\\" Description The Buddha teaches in the Pali Canon the five aggregates as follows: #\\"form\\" or \\"matter\\" (Skt., Pāli रूप rūpa; Tib. gzugs): matter, body or \\"material form\\" of a being or any existence. Buddhist texts state rupa of any person, sentient being and object to be composed of four basic elements or forces: earth (solidity), water (cohesion), fire (heat) and wind (motion). #\\"sensation\\" or \\"feeling\\" (Skt., Pāli वेदना vedanā; Tib. tshor-ba): sensory experience of an object. It is either pleasant, unpleasant or neutral. #\\"perception\\" (Skt. संज्ञा saṃjñā, Pāli सञ्ञा saññā, Tib. 'du-shes): sensory and mental process that registers, recognizes and labels (for instance, the shape of a tree, color green, emotion of fear). #\\"mental formations\\" (Skt. संस्कार saṃskāra, Pāli सङ्खार , Tib. 'du-byed): \\"constructing activities\\", \\"conditioned things\\", \\"volition\\", \\"karmic activities\\"; all types of mental imprints and conditioning triggered by an object. Includes any process that makes a person initiate action or act. #\\"consciousness\\" (Skt. विज्ञान vijñāna, Pāli विञ्ञाण , Tib. rnam-par-shes-pa): \\"discrimination\\" or \\"discernment\\". Awareness of an object and discrimination of its components and aspects, and is of six types, states Peter Harvey. The Buddhist literature discusses this skandha as, ## In the Nikayas/Āgamas: cognizance,See, for instance, SN 22.79, \\"Being Devoured\\" (Bodhi, 2000b, p. 915). that which discerns.Peter Harvey, The Selfless Mind. Curzon Press 1995, page 143-146 ## In the Abhidhamma: a series of rapidly changing interconnected discrete acts of cognizance. ## In some Mahayana sources: the base that supports all experience. Interpretation=Aggregates of personality= The five aggregates are often interpreted in the later tradition as an explanation of the constituents of person and personality, and \\"the list of aggregates became extremely important for the later development of the teaching.\\" According to this interpretation, in each skandha – body, sensations, perceptions, mental formations and consciousness – there is emptiness and no substance. According to Damien Keown and Charles Prebish, skandha in the context of canonical Buddhism asserts that \\"the notion of a self is unnecessarily superimposed upon five skandha\\" of a phenomenon or a living being. The skandha doctrine, state Matthew MacKenzie, is a form of anti-realism about everyday reality including persons, and presents an alternative to \\"substantialist views of the self\\". It is a Buddhist reductionism of everything perceived, each person and personality as an \\"aggregate, heap\\" of composite entities without essence. According to Harvey, the five skandhas give rise to a sense of personality, but are dukkha, impermanent, and without an enduring self or essence. Each aggregate is an object of grasping (clinging), at the root of self-identification as \\"I, me, myself\\". According to Harvey, realizing the real nature of skandhas, both in terms of impermanence and non-self, is necessary for nirvana. This 'emptiness from personality' can be found in descriptions of the enlightened, perfected state of Arhat and Tathagata, where there is no longer any identification with the five skandhas. This 'no essence' view has been a source of sustained questions, major disagreements and commentaries since ancient times, by non- Buddhist Indian religions, as well as within Buddhist traditions.; , Quote: We have seen how Buddhist thought criticizes the concept of an unchanging self as incoherent; however, both ancient and modern critics have argued that to do away with the self in the manner of Buddhist thought in fact creates insurmountable philosophical and moral problems. (...) We have seen how Buddhist thought breaks down an individual into five classes of physical and mental events known as skandhas or aggregates\\". The use of the skandhas concept to explain the self is unique to Buddhism among major Indian religions, and must be seen in the contexts of polemics about the Sarvastivada teachings that \\"phenomena\\" or its constituents are real. It contrasts with the premise of Hinduism and Jainism that a living being has an eternal soul or metaphysical self. David Kalupahana further explains that the individual is considered unreal but the skandha are considered real in some early Buddhist texts, but the skandha too are considered unreal and nonsubstantial in numerous other Buddhist Nikaya and Āgama texts. =Aggregates of experience and grasping= According to Thanissaro, the Buddha never tried to define what a \\"person\\" is, though scholars tend to approach the skandhas as a description of the constituents of the person. He adds that almost any Buddhist meditation teacher explains it that way, as even Buddhist commentaries from about 1st century CE onwards have done. In Thanissaro's view, this is incorrect, and he suggests that skandha should be viewed as activities, which cause suffering, but whose unwholesome workings can be interrupted.Thanissaro Bhikkhu (2010), The Five Aggregates. A Study Guide Rupert Gethin also notes that the five skandhas are not merely \\"the Buddhist analysis of man,\\" but \\"five aspects of an individual being's experience of the world [...] encompassing both grasping and all that is grasped.\\" Boisvert states that \\"many scholars have referred to the five aggregates in their works on Buddhism, [but] none have thoroughly explained their respective functions.\\" According to Boisvert, the five aggregates and dependent origination are closely related, explaining the process which binds us to samsara. Boisvert notes that the pancha- upadanakkhanda does not incorporate all human experience. Vedana may transform into either niramisa or nekkhamma-sita vedana, vedana which is not harmfull, or into amisa or gehasita vedana, a \\"type of sensation [which] may act as an agent bringing about the future arising of craving and aversion.\\" This is determined by sanna. According to Boisvert, \\"not all sanna belong to the sanna-skandha.\\" The wholesome sanna recognise the three marks of existence (dukkha, anatta, anicca), and do not belong to the sanna-skandha. Unwholesome sanna is not \\"conducive to insight,\\" and without proper sanna, the \\"person is likely to generate craving, clinging and becoming.\\" As with sanna, \\"not all sankhara belong to the sankharaskandha\\", since not all sankhara produce future effects. According to Johannes Bronkhorst, the notion that the five aggregates are not self has to be viewed in light of debates about \\"liberating knowledge,\\" the knowledge of Atman which was deemed liberating by the Vedic traditions. Bronkhorst notes that \\"knowledge of the self plays no useful role on the Buddha’s path to liberation.\\" What is important is not to grasp at the forms, sounds, odors, flavors, objects, and mental properties which are perceived with the six sense organs (these include mind as the sixth sense organ). The insight that the aggregates are not self aids in letting go of this grasping. Miri Albahari also objects to the usual understanding of the skandhas as denoting the absence of any \\"self.\\" Albahari has argued that the khandhas do not necessarily constitute the entirety of the human experience, and that the Hindu concept of Ātman (eternal soul) is not explicitly negated by Pāli Canon. According to Albani, \\"anattā is best understood as a practical strategy rather than as a metaphysical doctrine.\\" To Albahari, Nibbāna is an ever-present part of human nature, which is gradually \\"uncovered\\" by the cessation of ignorance. In Theravada Abhidhamma The Early Buddhist schools developed detailed analyses and overviews of the teachings found in the sutras, called Abhidharma. Each school developed its own Abhidharma. The best- known nowadays is the Theravāda Abhidhamma, but the Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma was historically very influential, and has been preserved partly in the Chinese Āgama. =Six sense bases= The internal and external sense bases together form the \\"six sense bases.\\" In this description, found in texts such as Salayatana samyutta, the coming together of an object and a sense-organ results in the arising of the corresponding consciousness. According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, the Theravada tradition teaches that the six sense bases accommodate \\"all the factors of existence\\", it is \\"the all\\", and \\"apart from which nothing at all exists,\\" and \\"are empty of a self and of what belongs to the self\\". The suttas themselves don't describe this as an alternative of the skandhas; it is in the Abhidhamma, striving to \\"a single all-inclusive system\\" that the five aggregates and the six sense bases are explicitly connected: * The first five external sense bases (visible form, sound, smell, taste and touch), and the first five internal sense bases (eye, ear, nose, tongue and body) are part of the form aggregate; * The mental sense-object (i.e. mental objects) overlap the first four aggregates (form, feeling, perception and formation); * The mental sense organ (mind) is comparable to the aggregate of consciousness. Bodhi states the six sense bases is a \\"vertical\\" view of human experiences while the aggregates is a \\"horizontal\\" (temporal) view.Bodhi, 2000b, pp. 1122-23 The Theravada Buddhist meditation practice on sense bases is aimed at both removing distorted cognitions such as those influenced by cravings, conceits and opinions, as well as \\"uprooting all conceivings in all its guises\\".Bodhi (2000b), pp. 1125-26 =Eighteen Dhātus and Four Paramatthas= The eighteen dhātus – Six External Bases, Six Internal Bases, and Six Consciousnesses – function through the five aggregates. These dhātus can be arranged into six triads, each triad composed of a sense object, a sense organ, and sense consciousness. The Abhidhamma and post-canonical Pali texts create a meta-scheme for the Sutta Pitaka's conceptions of aggregates, sense bases and dhattus (elements).Bodhi (2000a), p. 6. This meta-scheme is known as the four paramatthas or ultimate realities, three conditioned, one unconditioned: * Material phenomena (rūpa, form) * Mind or Consciousness (Citta) * Mental factors (Cetasikas: the nama-factors sensation, perception and formation) * Nibbāna =Twelve Nidanas= The Twelve Nidanas is a linear list of twelve elements from the Buddhist teachings which arise depending on the preceding link. While this list may be interpreted as describing the processes which give rise to rebirth, in essence it describes the arising of dukkha as a psychological process, without the involvement of an atman. Scholars regard it to be a later synthesis of several older lists. The first four links may be a mockery of the Vedic-Brahmanic cosmogony, as described in the Hymn of Creation of Veda X, 129 and the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. These were integrated with a branched list which describe the conditioning of mental processes, akin to the five skandhas. Eventually, this branched list developed into the standard twelvefold chain as a linear list. According to Boisvert, \\"the function of each of the aggregates, in their respective order, can be directly correlated with the theory of dependent origination - especially with the eight middle links.\\" Four of the five aggregates are explicitly mentioned in the following sequence, yet in a different order than the list of aggregates, which concludes with ': * mental formations (saṅkhāra • saṃskāra) condition consciousness (') * which conditions name-and-form (nāma-rūpa) * which conditions the precursors (', phassa • sparśa) to sensations (vedanā) * which in turn condition craving (') and clinging (upādāna) * which ultimately lead to the \\"entire mass of suffering\\" (kevalassa dukkhakkhandha). The interplay between the five-aggregate model of immediate causation and the twelve-nidana model of requisite conditioning is evident, for instance underlining the seminal role that mental formations have in both the origination and cessation of suffering. =Satipatthana= Mindfulness is thought to be applied to four upassanā (domains or bases), \\"constantly watching sensory experience in order to prevent the arising of cravings which would power future experience into rebirths,\\" which also overlap with the skandhas. The four domains are: * mindfulness of the body (kaya);(Pāli: kāya- sati, kāyagatā-sati; Skt. kāya-smṛti)Salient sections of the Pāli canon on kāya-sati (kāya-gatā-sati): http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/g_m/kaaya_gata_sati.htm * mindfulness of feelings or sensations (vedanā);(Pāli vedanā-sati; Skt. vedanā-smṛti) * mindfulness of mind or consciousness (citta);(Pāli citta-sati; Skt. citta- smṛti) and * mindfulness of dhammās.(Pāli dhammā-sati; Skt. dharma-smṛti) According to Grzegorz Polak, the four upassanā have been misunderstood by the developing Buddhist tradition, including Theravada, to refer to four different foundations. According to Polak, the four upassanā do not refer to four different foundations of which one should be aware, but are an alternate description of the jhanas, describing how the samskharas are tranquilized: * the six sense-bases which one needs to be aware of (kāyānupassanā); * contemplation on vedanās, which arise with the contact between the senses and their objects (vedanānupassanā); * the altered states of mind to which this practice leads (cittānupassanā); * the development from the five hindrances to the seven factors of enlightenment (dhammānupassanā). In the Mahayana tradition The Mahayana developed out of the traditional schools, introducing new texts and putting other emphases in the teachings, especially sunyata and the Bodhisattva-ideal. =India= The Prajnaparamita-teachings developed from the first century BCE onward. It emphasises the \\"emptiness\\" of everything that exists. This means that there are no eternally existing \\"essences\\", since everything is dependently originated. The skandhas too are dependently originated, and lack any substantial existence. According to Red Pine, the Prajnaparamita texts are a historical reaction to some early Buddhist Abhidhammas. Specifically, it is a response to Sarvastivada teachings that \\"phenomena\\" or its constituents are real. The prajnaparamita notion of \\"emptiness\\" is also consistent with the Theravada Abhidhamma. This is formulated in the Heart Sutra. The Sanskrit version of the \\"Prajnaparamita Hridaya Sutra\\" (\\"Heart Sutra\\"), which may have been composed in China from Sanskrit texts, and later back-translated into Sanskrit, states that the five skandhas are empty of self-existence,Red Pine (2004), p.2. and famously states \\"form is emptiness, emptiness is form The same is true with feelings, perceptions, mental formations and consciousness.\\"Nhat Hanh (1988), p.1. Again, also see Red Pine (2004), p. 2, and Suzuki (1960), p. 26. The Madhyamaka-school elaborates on the notion of the middle way. Its basic text is the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā, written by Nagarjuna, who refuted the Sarvastivada conception of reality, which reifies dhammas.Kalupahana 1975, page 78 The simultaneous non-reification of the self and reification of the skandhas has been viewed by some Buddhist thinkers as highly problematic.Jinpa 2002 , page 112. The Yogacara-school further analysed the workings of the mind, elaborated on the concept of nama-rupa and the five skandhas, and developed the notion of the Eight Consciousnesses. =China= Sunyata, in Chinese texts, is \\"wu\\", nothingness. In these texts, the relation between absolute and relative was a central topic in understanding the Buddhist teachings. The aggregates convey the relative (or conventional) experience of the world by an individual, although Absolute truth is realized through them. Commenting on the Heart Sutra, D.T. Suzuki notes: The Tathāgatagarbha Sutras, treating the idea of the Buddha-nature, developed in India but played a prominent role in China. The tathagatagarbha-sutras, on occasion, speak of the ineffable skandhas of the Buddha (beyond the nature of worldly skandhas and beyond worldly understanding). In the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra the Buddha tells of how the Buddha's skandhas are in fact eternal and unchanging. The Buddha's skandhas are said to be incomprehensible to unawakened vision. =Tibet= The Vajrayana tradition further develops the aggregates in terms of mahamudra epistemology and tantric reifications. Referring to mahamudra teachings, Chogyam Trungpa Trungpa, 2001, pp. 10–12; and, Trungpa, 2002, pp. 124, 133–134 identifies the form aggregate as the \\"solidification\\" of ignorance (Pali, avijjā; Skt., avidyā), allowing one to have the illusion of \\"possessing\\" ever dynamic and spacious wisdom (Pali, vijjā; Skt. vidyā), and thus being the basis for the creation of a dualistic relationship between \\"self\\" and \\"other.\\" According to Trungpa Rinpoche,Trungpa Rinpoche 1976, pp. 20–22 the five skandhas are \\"a set of Buddhist concepts which describe experience as a five-step process\\" and that \\"the whole development of the five skandhas...is an attempt on our part to shield ourselves from the truth of our insubstantiality,\\" while \\"the practice of meditation is to see the transparency of this shield.\\" Trungpa Rinpoche 1976, p. 23 Trungpa Rinpoche writes (2001, p. 38): See also *Anatta *Atman (Buddhism) *Nagarjuna *Pratitya-samutpada *Samsara *Sankhāra *Schools of Buddhism *Shunyata *Tathagatagarbha doctrine *Ti-lakkhana *Kosha NotesReferencesSources=Primary literature= ;Sutta Pitaka Ñāṇamoli, Bhikkhu (trans.) & Bodhi, Bhikkhu (ed.)

Economy rice stalls typically consist of a case containing anywhere from 10-15 troughs of cooked food, including meat, vegetables, eggs and tofu dishes. Customers select any combination of these dishes, which are served accompanied by a portion of steamed white rice. In Singapore, it is more common to find the food on open troughs kept warm by hot water and an electric heater below. Better quality economy rice stalls have warmers beneath the troughs of food which ensure that food is served hot. Origins Economy rice is thought of as a predominantly Chinese food - it is roughly analogous to the Malay or Indonesian concept of nasi padang or nasi campur (mixed rice). It is what most Chinese Singaporeans and Malaysians think of when they refer to 'home-cooked food' as it is similar to what would be eaten at home, with rice forming the basis of their meal and accompanied by various cooked dishes.http://www.penangfaces.chanlilian.net/chinese-economy-rice/ Thus, there is no specific origin for the dish; instead it blends dishes and ingredients from the region they're cooked in. Economy rice stalls thus evolved as a way for the general public to obtain a quick, and most importantly, cheap meal option outside of home. An economy rice meal is usually one of the cheapest options available for a meal at a hawker centre (hence its name), especially if one is judicious in choosing the less expensive dishes (generally vegetables and tofu). Common dishes Common dishes offered at an economy rice stall can include sweet and sour pork, braised tofu, braised cabbage, steamed egg custard, stir-fried Chinese vegetables, fried eggs, and an assortment of deep-fried items. True to its Chinese origins, most of the dishes on offer tend to have their roots in Chinese cuisine. Other names Economy rice is known by several other names, and in general conversation it is rare for anyone to refer to it as such, even though many stalls tend to proclaim \\"Economy rice\\" on their signboards. Other names for economy rice include Tsap Fan () in Cantonese or Tsap Tsai Png () in Hokkien and colloquially, \\"Point Point Rice\\", named for the method of ordering one's meal which involves simply asking for a plate of rice and then pointing at the various dishes desired. It is unclear how the latter term originated.

Moreover, Gavin Dunbar, a 16th-century Archbishop of Glasgow, wrote in his Epistolare that Nechtan's see was moved from Mortlach to Aberdeen in the year 1125, partially contradicting the account of Boece.

A metropolis () is a large city or conurbation which is a significant economic, political, and cultural center for a country or region, and an important hub for regional or international connections, commerce, and communications. The term is Ancient Greek () and means the \\"mother city\\" of a colony (in the ancient sense), that is, the city which sent out settlers. This was later generalized to a city regarded as a center of a specified activity, or any large, important city in a nation. A big city belonging to a larger urban agglomeration, but which is not the core of that agglomeration, is not generally considered a metropolis but a part of it. The plural of the word is metropolises, although the Latin plural is metropoles, from the Greek metropoleis (). For urban centers outside metropolitan areas that generate a similar attraction on a smaller scale for their region, the concept of the regiopolis (\\"regio\\" for short) was introduced by urban and regional planning researchers in Germany in 2006.Prof. Dr. Iris Reuther (FG Stadt- und Regionalplanung, Universität Kassel): Presentation \\"Regiopole Rostock\\". December 11, 2008. Retrieved June 13, 2009 (pdf).  History  The Colosseum at night in Rome, Italy In the ancient world, a metropolis was the city or state of origin of a colony.  Etymology and modern usage  Metropolis (μητρόπολις) is a Greek word, coming from μήτηρ, mḗtēr meaning \\"mother\\" and πόλις, pólis meaning \\"city\\" or \\"town\\", which is how the Greek colonies of antiquity referred to their original cities, with whom they retained cultic and political-cultural connections. The word was used in post-classical Latin for the chief city of a province, the seat of the government and, in particular, ecclesiastically for the seat or see of a metropolitan bishop to whom suffragan bishops were responsible.Louis Boisgibault, Fahad Al Kabbani (2020): Energy Transition in Metropolises, Rural Areas and Deserts. Wiley - ISTE. (Energy series) . This usage equates the province with the diocese or episcopal see.\\"metropolis, n.\\" OED Online, Oxford University Press, June 2017, www.oed.com/view/Entry/117704.

Global city  The concept of a global city (or world city) is of a city that has a direct and tangible effect on global affairs through socioeconomic means. The term has become increasingly familiar, because of the rise of globalization (i.e., global finance, communications, and travel). An attempt to define and categorize world cities by financial criteria was made by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC), based primarily at Loughborough University in England. The study ranked cities based on their provision of \\"advanced producer services\\" such as accountancy, advertising, finance and law. The inventory identifies three levels of world cities and several sub-ranks (see GaWC study). A metropolis is not necessarily a global city—or, being one, it might not be among the top-ranking—due to its standards of living, development, and infrastructure. A metropolis that is also a global city is a global metropolis.  Africa  Cairo Skyline Casablanca city Metropolis = Egypt = Cairo and Alexandria are considered Egypt's biggest metropolises. = Morocco = In Morocco there are five metropolitan areas:Casablanca, Rabat, Tangier, Fes and Marrakech are considered Morocco's biggest metropolises. Of these, Casablanca is the largest. = Nigeria = Lagos is the most populous metropolis in Nigeria as well as in Africa. = South Africa = In South Africa, a metropolitan municipality or \\"Category A municipality\\" is a municipality which executes all the functions of local government for a conurbation. This is by contrast to areas which are primarily rural, where the local government is divided into district municipalities (comparable to a \\"county\\" in the US) and local municipalities. There are eight metropolitan municipalities in South Africa.  Asia =Afghanistan= The capital city, Kabul, has grown to become the country's sole metropolis, and is the only city with more than one million people.http://www.businessinsider.com/kabul- present-day-2014-3?IR=T = Bangladesh = Dhaka is Bangladesh's largest city In the People's Republic of Bangladesh, there are eleven metropolitan areas: Dhaka North, Dhaka South, Gazipur, Chittagong, Rajshahi, Khulna, Sylhet, Barisal, and Rangpur.

Special police departments are allotted for the metropolitan cities, and there are city corporations for which mayors are elected for five-year regimes. Most of these cities have population density of 35,000/square mile or more. Dhaka is the wealthiest city out of all of them and is considered a Megacity because its population surpassed 10 million. = China = China is known for its large number of metropoles, with recognised \\"tiers\\" that classify mainland metropoles. Nationally, the largest metropoles include Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong, the first four being the \\"First-Tier Cities\\" (一线城市). Second-tier cities are numerous and consist of regional centres, such as Nanjing, Chongqing, Chengdu, Shenyang, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Changsha, Xi'an, Jinan, Qingdao, etc. Many of China's metropoles constitute a city cluster, such as the Yangtze River Delta Megalopolis and Pearl River Delta Megalopolis. = India = Mumbai, Maharashtra is India's largest city Bangalore, Karnataka is India's fifth-most populous metropolis The Census Commission defines a megacity as, \\"the cities having a population of more than 10 million and above\\" and said that in the 2011 Indian census, there were three megacities: \\"Greater Mumbai UA (18.4 million), Delhi UA (16.3 million) and Kolkata UA (14.1 million)\\". = Indonesia = Jakarta, the largest and busiest city in Indonesia In Indonesia, the metropolitan cities are in Jabodetabek (Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, Bekasi), the biggest metropolitan area in Southeast Asia and the fifth metropolitan area in the world (2007).

Structured like a prefecture instead of a normal city, there is only one to in Japan, namely Tokyo. , Japan has 12 other cities with populations greater than one million. The same Kanji character in Chinese, or in generic Japanese (traditional or non-specific), translates variously—city, municipality, special municipality—all qualify. =Kazakhstan= In Kazakhstan, Almaty is the largest city whilst the capital Nur-Sultan is the second largest, Shymkent is the third largest city, all three having populations of over one million each. = Lebanon = Beirut, Sidon, and Tripoli are three of the main metropolitan areas along the Lebanese coast.

These are the most populous metropolitan areas in the country. In decreasing order of the population of 2015 census, they are Seoul, Busan, Incheon, Daegu, Daejeon, Gwangju and Ulsan. According to the census of 2015, cities of Changwon and Suwon also qualify for being elevated to the level of metropolitan cities (having population over 1 million), but any future plans to promote them into metropolitan city are unlikely to be accepted because of political concerns about the structure of administrative divisions. There are also some county-level cities with increasing population near 1 million, namely Goyang, Yongin, and Seongnam, but they are also unlikely to be promoted into metropolitan city because they are all satellite cities of Seoul. = Sri Lanka = The City of Colombo is the largest city in Sri Lanka. The Colombo Metropolitan Area is Sri Lanka's most urbanized region with a population of over 5 million people. = Turkey = Levent, Istanbul, Turkey In Turkey the metropolitan cities are described as \\"büyükşehir\\".

The largest German city by administrative borders is Berlin, while Rhine-Ruhr is the largest metropolitan area (with more than 10 million people). The importance of a city is measured with three groups of indicators, also called metropolitan functions: The decision making and control function, the innovation and competition function, and the gateway function. These functions are seen as key domains for metropolitan regions in developing their performance. In spatial planning, a metropolis is usually observed within its regional context, thus the focus is mainly set on the metropolitan regions. These regions can be mono central or multi central. Eleven metropolitan regions have been defined due to these indicators: Berlin- Brandenburg, Bremen-Oldenburg, Dresden-Halle-Leipzig, Frankfurt-Rhine-Main, Hamburg, Hannover-Braunschweig-Göttingen-Wolfsburg, Munich, Nuremberg, Rhine- Neckar, Rhine-Ruhr (with Cologne/Bonn), and Stuttgart. = Hungary = Budapest has a population of 1 750 000, more than eight times the population of the second largest city, Debrecen. = Italy = As of January 1, 2015, there are 14 \\"metropolitan cities\\" in Italy.

The term is retained by the London police force, the Metropolitan Police Service (the \\"Met\\"). The chief officer of the Metropolitan Police is formally known as the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. Since 1974 six conurbations (outside London) have been known as metropolitan counties, each divided into metropolitan districts. Other conurbations in the United Kingdom are also sometimes considered to be metropolitan areas, most notably the West Midlands (centred on the city of Birmingham), West Yorkshire (centred on the city of Leeds), Merseyside (centred on the city of Liverpool), Greater Manchester and Greater Glasgow which make up the most densely populated areas in the British Isles outside London.  North America  Toronto is Canada's largest city. Mexico City is Mexico's capital and largest city New York City is the largest city in the U.S. = Canada = Canada's six largest metropoles are Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Ottawa, Calgary, and Edmonton.

Mexico City represents all three factors as it is the country's capital and financial center with 27 million people. Other metropolises are Monterrey and Guadalajara, both metropolitan areas with a population over 6,000,000 inhabitants. = United States = In the United States, an incorporated area or group of areas having a population more than 50,000 is required to have a metropolitan planning organization in order to facilitate major infrastructure projects and to ensure financial solvency. Thus, a population of 50,000 or greater has been used as a de facto standard to define a metropolis in the United States. A similar definition is used by the United States Census Bureau. The bureau defines a Metropolitan Statistical Area as \\"at least one urbanized area of 50,000 or more inhabitants.\\" The six largest metropolitan areas in the USA are New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, and Washington, D.C., with New York City being the largest.  Oceania = Australia = Sydney is Australia's largest city and metropolis The Government of Australia defines a metropolitan area as any statistical division or district with a population of more than 100,000.

Others metropolises in Brazil with more than one million inhabitants include: Belém, Belo Horizonte, Brasília, Campinas, Curitiba, Fortaleza, Goiânia, Maceió, Manaus, Porto Alegre, Recife, Salvador and São Luís. = Chile = The primary metropolis in Chile is its capital: the city of Santiago, with a population of 7 million, living across its metropolitan area. Santiago is the main political, financial, industrial, commercial, and cultural hub of Chile. The other two metropolises in the country are the conurbations of Valparaíso and Concepción with a population of nearly 1 million each. = Colombia = In Colombia, Bogotá is the main metropolis with over 13 million inhabitants residing in its Metropolitan Area, which includes boroughs like Soacha, Mosquera, Cota, and Chía. The second metropolis in Colombia is Medellín, which includes such boroughs as Envigado, Itagüi, La Estrella, and Sabaneta. This metropolitan area is known for having the first and only Metro in Colombia, the Medellín Metro. Bogotá has the Transmilenio, a Rapid Transit Metro-bus system. = Peru = The Lima metropolitan area is Peru's capital and largest city with over 10 million inhabitants, more than one third of the total national population.  Metropolis as a mainland area  In France, Portugal, Spain, and the Netherlands, the word metropolis (métropole (Fr.) / metrópole (Port.) / metrópoli (Spa.) / metropool (Dutch)) designates the mainland part of a country situated on or close to the European mainland; in the case of France, this means France without its overseas departments. For Portugal and Spain during the Spanish Empire and Portuguese Empire period, the term was used to designate Portugal or Spain minus its colonies (the Ultramar). In France métropole can also be used to refer to a large urban agglomeration; for example, \\"La Métropole de Lyon\\" (the Lyon Metropolis).

Initially meant to be published by MGM Interactive in late 1998, they dropped the title and gave it to Sony Computer Entertainment America. It was released in 1999 for the PlayStation. Plot The game's plot takes place in sometime before 2098 A.D., all of Earth's armed forces were disintegrated into one large corporation, SenTrax. SenTrax vowed to create a robot army to fight humanity's wars, so mankind itself would not have to. However, they needed the peoples' vote to set this plan into motion, and thus developed the titular \\"Tiny Tank\\" - a small yellow tank with an occasionally unfriendly attitude. The creation of this cute killing machine made SenTrax's popularity skyrocket, and won them the vote. As thanks, the corporation set up an exhibition showing their yellow mascot fighting off the entire SenTrax army on July 4, 2098, broadcast live over the Internet. However, when the rehearsal began, one of the SenTrax robots had been accidentally fitted with live ammunition and destroyed Tiny with one shot. As a result, Tiny's \\"positronic brain\\" (his artificial intelligence system) shattered, and its shards gave \\"life\\" to the entire robot army. The robot that had fired the shot, now self-aware and calling himself Mutank, took control of the rampant robots and began to eliminate humanity so that machines could thrive. Humanity was forced to evacuate into underground asteroid shelters as the mechanical army conquered the surface. But then on July 4, 2198 A.D., which was 100 years later, Tiny Tank was finally restored by automated SenTrax Fix-It Crabs, which were minuscule robots made to repair damaged machinery. Also as a result, a female artificial intelligence on board an orbital satellite reawakened Tiny, sent him to fight Mutank's robot army and save mankind once again, and gave him his mission briefing for his spying assignments to thwart the criminal conspiracy Mutank and his hitmen have started. Gameplay Tiny Tank is a relatively straightforward action platformer. The player controls Tiny as he traverses many levels, eliminating SenTrax forces as he goes. There are two bars at the top of the screen that show Tiny's health and the amount of nanometal acquired. Nanometal is essential for the on-board Fix-It Crabs to repair Tiny. If the nanometal meter runs out, health cannot be regenerated. There is also a map on the upper right hand corner identifying the surroundings, enemies, and mission objectives. Tiny can pick up fallen parts from destroyed enemies: *Positronic Brains (P-Brains) - A robot's artificial intelligence system. Can be used to improve and upgrade equipped weapons. *Weapons - Fallen weapons can be attached to Tiny's four weapon hardpoints. *Debris (Nanometal) - Essential for the on- board Fix-It Crabs to repair Tiny. There are also other upgrades that are placed around the levels themselves that can be acquired: *Invulnerability - Temporary invulnerability. *Nanometal - Essential for the on-board Fix-It Crabs to repair Tiny, but these possess much more material than enemy debris does. Appears as a gray rectangular container. Tiny also has deployable \\"Teeny Weeny Tanks\\", even smaller versions of himself that can be manually controlled or set to hunt enemies, gather upgrades, or protect Tiny. Reception Many magazines gave early positive reviews while the game was still in development before Sony stepped in. Next Generation, for example, said that the game \\"succeeds in what it sets out to accomplish, both [in] its humor and its gameplay.\\" After release, however, reviews were mixed.

It is a dark vinaceous or purple-colored edible mushroom, and grows with coniferous trees in late summer and autumn. It is found in Europe and North America. Taxonomy First described by mycologist Christian Hendrik Persoon in his 1801 work Synopsis methodica fungorum as Agaricus caeruleus, its specific epithet is the Latin caeruleus meaning \\"blue\\". It was transferred to the genus Russula in 1838 by the Swedish father of mycology Elias Magnus Fries. The 1927 name Russula amara by Kučera is a synonym. Description The cap is in diameter. It is dark purplish-brown, with a dark, sometimes almost black centre. At first it is convex, or even nearly bell-shaped, but later flattens. It nearly always retains a broad pointed boss (umbo) in the cap centre which is a profile that is almost unique within the genus. The cap skin peels to two-thirds, and it later has a furrowed margin. The firm, white stipe is high, wide and narrowly club-shaped. The gills are adnexed to almost free, and are pale ochre, giving a spore print of the same colour. They are quite closely spaced initially. The flesh is white and tastes mild, but the cap skin is bitter on the tongue. =Similar species= Russula atropurpurea (Krombh.) Britzelm is infrequent with conifers, preferring deciduous woods, and forests. Its cap is never umbonate, but usually depressed. Russula viscida Kudrna has no umbo either, and is very rare. The cuticle of the cap hardly peels at all. Distribution and habitat Russula caerulea appears in late summer and autumn. It is widespread in the northern temperate zones, Europe, Asia, and North America. It is probably mycorrhizal with pine trees (Pinus), on sandy soils. Edibility This mushroom is edible, but has a bitter cap skin after chewing.

The media type is identified by the manufacturer and media ID, which is often unrelated to the brand of the media due to rebadging. Write strategies are essential for compatibility with various types of blank media, and are typically stored in the drive's firmware. If a drive lacks a write strategy for a media type, it will only be able to write using minimum speed. Drive manufacturers typically include new or improved write strategies as part of a firmware upgrade, in order to extend or improve compatibility with blank media. In cases where official support for a drive has been discontinued or is deemed unsatisfactory, users have come up with ways to patch the write strategies by modding the drive's firmware. Learning Many DVD-writers have a learning feature (branded with names like \\"smart-burn\\") that allows the drive to collect empirical data from its actual usage. The drive stores data from previous burns in its EEPROM, allowing it to adapt the default write strategies to account for individual drive variations, such as calibration, which may be affected by environment and age. A newer feature contained in some DVD writers allows a drive to invent write strategies for unknown media types, ostensibly reducing its dependence on firmware to provide explicit compatibility. However, because the drive initially knows nothing of the media type, early burns are frequently of poor quality, and the media's optimal strategy may never be found. Thus, in practice, this form of learning is generally a last resort, and firmware support is preferable. An attempt to address this weakness is online learning, which allows the drives to share learned data. Branded technologies that incorporate this form of learning have been given names like \\"solid burn\\" and \\"hypertuning\\". In either case, if the history data is reset, or if the data is skewed by a series of irregular burns, the speed and/or quality of a typical burn may not be optimal until the history is repopulated with proper result data again.

The punished group may often have no direct association with the other individuals or groups, or direct control over their actions. In times of war and armed conflict, collective punishment has resulted in atrocities, and is a violation of the laws of war and the Geneva Conventions. Historically, occupying powers have used collective punishment to retaliate against and deter attacks on their forces by resistance movements (such as destroying entire towns and villages which were believed to have harboured or aided such resistance movements). History=2nd century BC= During the Qin Dynasty of China (221–207 BC), emperor Qin Shi Huang upheld his rule by enforcing strict laws, with the most serious of crimes, such as treason, punishable by what is known as nine familial exterminations – this involved the execution of the perpetrator's entire families as well as the perpetrators themselves, where the members are categorized into nine groups. The process of familial extermination was carried on by subsequent Chinese dynasties for serious crimes, with a significant number of recorded sentences during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644), until the punishment was officially repealed by the government of the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912) in 1905. =9th–15th centuries= In the Tithing, groups of ten men swearing the Frankpledge, the compulsory sharing of responsibility and punishment, was in use at least since the time of Alfred the Great in the 9th century. The Statute of Winchester of 1285 provided that \\"the whole hundred … shall be answerable\\" for any theft or robbery. =16th century= During the Ming dynasty of China, 16 palace women attempted to assassinate the Jiajing Emperor. All were sentenced to death by slow slicing. Ten members of the women's families were also beheaded, while a further 20 were enslaved and gifted to ministers. =18th century= The Intolerable Acts were seen as a collective punishment of Massachusetts for the Boston Tea Party. =19th century= The principle of collective punishment was laid out by Union General William Tecumseh Sherman in his Special Field Order 120, November 9, 1864, which laid out the rules for his \\"March to the sea\\" in the American Civil War: > V. To army corps commanders alone is entrusted the power to destroy mills, > houses, cotton-gins, etc..., and for them this general principle is laid > down: In districts and neighborhoods where the army is unmolested, no > destruction of such property should be permitted; but should guerrillas or > bushwhackers molest our march, or should the inhabitants burn bridges, > obstruct roads, or otherwise manifest local hostility, then army commanders > should order and enforce a devastation more or less relentless according to > the measure of such hostility.Sherman, William T., Memoirs of General W.T. > Sherman, 2nd ed., D. Appleton & Co., 1913 (1889), Chapter XXI. Reprinted by > the Library of America, 1990, . British forces in the Boer Wars and the Germans in the Franco-Prussian War justified such actions as being in accord with the laws of war then in force.\\"The laws of war as to conquered territory\\" by William Miller Collier, New York Times, November 29, 1914, p. SM6 =20th century=United States In 1906, 167 black U.S. soldiers stationed in Brownsville, Texas, were dishonorably discharged on orders of President Theodore Roosevelt in response to the shooting of two white citizens in the middle of the night of August 13, 1906. One man was killed and the other, a police lieutenant, was injured and it was never discovered who the shooter(s) were, though they were presumed to have been members of the nearby Fort Brown. The soldiers of Companies Bravo, Charlie, and Delta of the 25th Infantry Regiment, many of whom served in the Philippines and Cuba during America's war with Spain, were punished for the crime collectively and were denied army pensions.\\"The Brownsville Raid\\" by John D. Weaver World War I During the First World War, the German invasion of Belgium was marked by numerous acts of collective punishment, in response to real or perceived acts of resistance. Some 6,000 civilians were killed, and 25,000 homes burned during this period.Lipkes J. (2007) Rehearsals: The German Army in Belgium, August 1914, Leuven University Press Russian Revolution During the 1917 uprising against Nicholas II during World War I, many of Nicholas' distant relatives in Russia were killed by revolutionaries during that year's uprising. In July 1918, less than a year after the October revolution that overthrew Alexander Kerensky's Russian Provisional Government and early in the Russian Civil War that began shortly afterwards, Nicholas II and his immediate family and remaining servants were shot by their captors. World War II=By Germany= roundup hostages, as revenge for the assassination of 5 German policemen and 1 SS member by Armia Krajowa resistance fighters in Nazi-occupied Poland. Warsaw, October 2, 1943 During the Nazi occupation of Poland, the Germans applied collective responsibility: any kind of help given to a person of Jewish faith or origin was punishable by death, and that not only for the rescuers themselves but also for their families. This was widely publicized by the Germans. During the occupation, for every German killed by a Pole, 100–400 Poles were shot in retribution. Communities were held collectively responsible for the purported Polish counter-attacks against the invading German troops. Mass executions of roundup (pol: łapanka) hostages were conducted every single day during the Wehrmacht advance across Poland in September 1939 and thereafter. Poland lost over 5 million citizens during the occupation by Nazi Germany, mostly civilians.Piotrowski, Tadeusz (2005). \\"Poland WWII Casualties\\". Table 1 (Project InPosterum). Retrieved July 22, 2013. \\"Poland's WWII population losses (in millions). Description. Jewish: 3.1. Ethnic Poles: 2.0. Other minorities: 0.5. Total: 5.6 million.\\" Germany also applied collective punishment elsewhere. In the summer of 1941, Wehrmacht troops executed several hundred people in Kondomari, Alikianos, Kandanos and elsewhere in retaliation for the participation of Cretan civilians in the Battle of Crete. During its occupation by the Axis from 1941 to 1944, Greece suffered a remarkably high death toll due to reprisals against the support and involvement of the population in the Resistance. Large-scale massacres were carried out in places such as Domeniko, Kommeno, Viannos, Lyngiades, Kali Sykia, Drakeia, Kalavryta, Mesovouno, Damasta, Distomo, Kedros, Chortiatis and many others. Entire villages (e.g. Anogeia, Vorizia, Magarikari, Kamares, Lochria), were also pillaged and burnt. In Yugoslavia (now Serbia), Nazi troops killed 434 men in three villages near Kragujevac on October 19, 1941 as punishment for previous actions of the Serbian resistance movement. In the next two days, the Nazis also killed more than 13,000 people in Kraljevo, Kragujevac, and Sumarice, including 300 students from Kragujevac First High School. In 1942, the Germans destroyed the village of Lidice, Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic) killing 340 inhabitants as collective punishment or reprisal for that year's assassination of Reinhard Heydrich by nearby commandos (the village Ležáky was also destroyed in retribution). In the French village of Oradour-sur-Glane 642 of its inhabitants – men, women, and children – were slaughtered by the German Waffen-SS in 1944, as were 335 Italians in that same year's Ardeatine massacre in caves outside Rome. In the Dutch village of Putten*Official Website and the Italian villages of Sant'Anna di Stazzema and Marzabotto, as well as in the Soviet village of KortelisyWorld War II in Ukraine : Kortelisy (Ukraine), Lidice (Czechoslovakia) & Oradour- sur-Glane (France): Razed Villages. (in what is now Ukraine), large-scale reprisal killings were carried out by the Germans. The Massacre of Borovë occurred on July 9, 1943, in the village of Borovë, in southeastern Albania. German forces killed 107 civilians as a reprisal for a partisan attack on a German convoy the days before. In Lithuania, on June 3, 1944, after attack of Soviet partisans on a group of Germans in a nearby forest, a punishment squadron burned alive 119 people (including 49 children under age of 16) – almost all inhabitants of village of Pirčiupiai. =Against Germany= The expulsion of German speaking population groups after World War II by the Soviet Union, Poland and Czechoslovakia represent one of the greatest examples of collective punishment in terms of the number of victims.

Nicosia, Jonathan Huener \\"Business and industry in Nazi Germany\\", p.130,131 Not until late in the war did the US public assign collective responsibility to the German people.

Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention specifically forbids collective punishment. USSR Joseph Stalin's mass deportations of many nationalities of the USSR to remote regions (including the Chechens, Crimean Tatars, Volga Germans and many others) exemplifies officially orchestrated collective punishment. Stalin used the partial removal of potentially trouble- making ethnic groups as a technique consistently during his career: Poles (1939–1941 and 1944–45), Romanians (1941 and 1944–1953), Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians (1941 and 1945–1949), Volga Germans (1941), Chechens, and Ingushes (1944). Shortly before, during and immediately after World War II, Stalin conducted a series of deportations on a huge scale which profoundly affected the ethnic map of the Soviet Union. Between 1941 and 1949 the Soviet authorities deported an estimated nearly 3.3 million people to Siberia and to the Central Asian republics. By some estimates up to 43% of the resettled population died of diseases and malnutrition. The deportations started with Poles from Belarus, Ukraine and European Russia (see Poles in the former Soviet Union) 1932–1936. Koreans in the Russian Far East were deported in 1937 (see Deportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union). After the Soviet invasion of Poland (17 September 1939) following the corresponding German invasion (1 September 1939) that marked the start of World War II in Europe, the Soviet Union annexed eastern parts (the so-called \\"Kresy\\") of the Second Polish Republic. During 1939–1941 the Soviet regime deported 1.45 million people inhabitants of this area, of whom 63% were Poles and 7% were Jews.Poland's Holocaust, Tadeusz Piotrowski, 1998 , p. 14 Similar events followed in the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania following their incorporation into the Soviet union in 1940.Soviet Mass Deportations from Latvia More than 200,000 people are estimated to have been deported from the Baltic in 1940–1953. 10% of the entire adult Baltic population was deported or sent to labor camps.The Baltic States (See June deportation, Operation Priboi, Soviet deportations from Estonia.) Volga GermansDeportation and seven (overwhelmingly Turkic or non-Slavic) nationalities of the Crimea and the northern Caucasus were deported: the Crimean Tatars,Deportation of Crimean Tatars by Stalin Kalmyks, Chechens, Ingush, Balkars, Karachays, and Meskhetian Turks. All Crimean Tatars were deported en masse in a form of collective punishment. One can regard pogroms may be considered examples of unofficial collective punishment which resemble rioting. About 14 million Germans (Heimatvertriebene) were moved out of territories formerly part of the East of Germany; up to three million of them died. Azerbaijan Black January was a massacre of civilians committed by the Red Army in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic in 1990. The Human Rights Watch report entitled \\"Black January in Azerbaijan\\" states: \\"Indeed, the violence used by the Soviet Army on the night of January 19–20 was so out of proportion to the resistance offered by Azerbaijanis as to constitute an exercise in collective punishment.\\" =21st century=North Korea In North Korea, political prisoners are sent to the Kwan-li-so concentration camps along with their relatives without any fair trial. North Korean citizens convicted of more serious political crimes are sentenced to life imprisonment, and the summary two generations of their family (children and grandchildren) will be born in the camps as part of the \\"3 generations of punishment\\" policy instigated by state founder Kim Il-Sung in 1948.Kaechon internment camp North Korea's political penal labor colonies, transliterated kwalliso or kwan-li-so, constitute one of three forms of political imprisonment in the country, the other two being what Hawk (2012) translates as \\"short-term detention/forced- labor centers\\", literally \\"place(s) of gathering\\" and \\"long-term prison labor camps\\", literally \\"place(s) of reeducation\\" for misdemeanor and felony offences respectively. In total, there are an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 political prisoners housed within the North Korean imprisonment system. In contrast to these other systems, the condemned are sent there without any form of judicial process as are their immediate three generations of family members as kin punishment. North Korea's kwalliso consist of a series of sprawling encampments measuring kilometers long and kilometers wide. The number of these encampments has varied over time. They are located mainly in the valleys between high mountains, mostly in the northern provinces of North Korea. There are between 5,000 and 50,000 prisoners per kwalliso, totaling perhaps some 150,000 to 200,000 prisoners throughout North Korea. The kwalliso are usually surrounded at their outer perimeters by barbed-wire fences punctuated with guard towers and patrolled by heavily armed guards. The encampments include self-contained closed \\"village\\" compounds for single persons, usually the alleged wrongdoers, and other closed, fenced-in \\"villages\\" for the extended families of the wrongdoers. Israel The current blockade of Gaza has been criticized by the International Committee of the Red Cross, in a United Nations report, and by various other organisations as collective punishment aimed at the Palestinians. In Alamarin v. IDF Commander in Gaza Strip the Israeli High Court of Justice held that the homes of Palestinians who have committed violent acts may be demolished under the Defence (Emergency) Regulations, even if the residence has other inhabitants who are unconnected to the crime.. India The 1984 anti-Sikh riots or the 1984 Sikh Massacre was a riot directed against Sikhs in India, by anti-Sikh mobs, in response to the assassination of Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards. This caused more than 3000 deaths. The CBI is of the opinion that the acts of violence were well organized with support from the officials in the Delhi police and central government at the time, headed by Indira Gandhi's son, Rajiv Gandhi. Rajiv, a Congress party member who was sworn in as the Prime Minister after his mother's death, when asked about the riots said \\"When a big tree falls, the earth shakes\\". In 2011, Human Rights Watch reported the Government of India had \\"yet to prosecute those responsible for the mass killings\\". The 2011 WikiLeaks cable leaks revealed that the United States was convinced regarding the complicity of the Indian government led by the Indian National Congress in the riots, and termed it as \\"opportunism\\" and \\"hatred\\" of the Congress government against Sikhs. Also in 2011, a new set of mass graves were discovered in Haryana, and Human Rights Watch reported that \\"Widespread anti-Sikh attacks in Haryana were part of broader revenge attacks\\" in India. Pakistan On May 20, 2008, the Pakistan Army conducted collective punishment against a village called Spinkai, located in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan. The operation was called 'zalzala', which is Arabic for earthquake. At first, the Pakistan Army swept through with helicopter gunships, artillery and tanks. After four days of heavy fighting, 25 militants and six soldiers died. The rest of the militants retreated up the valley. After the capture of the village the army discovered bomb factories, detonation-ready suicide jackets and schools for teenage suicide bombers. The Pakistan Army immediately decided to punish the village for harboring the Taliban and allowing the militants to operate in and from the village to conduct further terror attacks in Pakistan. Bulldozers and explosives experts turned Spinkai's bazaar into a mile-long pile of rubble. Petrol stations, shops, and even parts of the hospital were leveled or blown up. The villagers were forbidden from returning to their homes. Pakistani commanders, who were speaking to the media, insisted they had been merciful in their application of \\"collective punishment\\" – a practice invented by the British who demarcated the tribal areas over a century ago. South Africa South Africa still retains the Apartheid-era law of common purpose, by which those who make up part of a group can be punished for the crimes of other group members, even if they were not themselves actively involved. In August 2012 this came to public attention when 270 miners were threatened with prosecution for participating in a demonstration. During the demonstration at the Marikana mine, 34 miners were shot by police. Many of the miners were armed. When prosecutors said they would pursue charges against other miners who were part of the protest, there was a public outcry. Syria Throughout most of Syria's ongoing civil war, collective punishment has been a recurring method used by the Syrian government to quell opposition cities and suburbs throughout the country, whereby entire cities are besieged, shelled, and destroyed if that city is deemed as pro-opposition. Upon retaking the capital Damascus after the 2012 Battle of Damascus, the Syrian government began a campaign of collective punishment against Sunni suburbs in-and-around the capital which had supported Free Syrian Army presence in their neighborhoods. accessdate=2012-09-26 In opposition-controlled cities and districts in Aleppo Province and Aleppo city, reports indicate that the Syrian government is attacking civilians at bread bakeries with artillery rounds and rockets, with the reports indicating that the bakeries were shelled indiscriminately.https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/30/us-syria-crisis- rights-idUSBRE87T0HE20120rian Human Rights Watch said these are war crimes, as the only military targets wherever the few rebels manning the bakeries, and that dozens of civilians were killed. In Idlib province in the northwest of the country, entire cities were shelled and bombed for sheltering opposition activists and rebels, with the victims mostly civilians, along with heavy financial losses. Theories Rather than attempt to discover some \\"contra- causal free will\\", modern philosophers will usually use notions of intention to establish individual moral responsibility. This Kantian approach may not be the only way to assess responsibility, especially considering groups may need a unique approach to individuals.http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/collective- responsibility/#5 Collective Responsibility. At Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. First published Mon August 8, 2005; substantive revision Mon June 14, 2010 For instance, there is the issue that consistent (not hypocritical) individuals may nevertheless experience a discursive dilemma when they try to act as a group. Philosopher Kenneth Shockley suggests we focus on group faults and the punishments that would bring change. Punishments, for a group, might include: full or partial disbanding, weakening bonds between members, or de- institutionalizing some of the group's norms. Neta Crawford says groups can be expected to change, but also apologize and make amends. That might mean groups must forfeit important parts of themselves. In this case, groups are being held responsible for organizing or incentivizing harmful behaviors. Shockley calls this the group's \\"coordinating control\\" over members. He says group responsibility can mitigate individual responsibility. See also * Achan * Achor * Alamarin v.

Background  Dvořák's fourteen string quartets cover the bulk of his composing career, from 1862 (No. 1) to 1895 (No. 14). The first string quartet was not his first chamber composition: he had written the String Quintet in A minor (Op. 1) in Summer 1861. In 1887 Dvořák decided to rework the long forgotten quartet. He removed a good deal of what he considered the unnecessary \\"filler\\" in the original version. The composition was dedicated to the director of Prague Conservatory, , who was Dvořák's teacher of music theory at the Prague Organ School. No actual performance has been documented before 1888, when the revised version of the work was played at a concert of the (Arts Discussion Group) in the Rudolfinum in Prague. The players were members of the orchestra of the National Theatre, Karel Ondříček, Jan Pelikán, Petr Mareš and Alois Neruda.  Structure  The work is composed in four movements: The approximate duration is 48 minutes. The strongest pointer to Dvořák's future mastership is in the three-part trio section of the third movement, which is the forerunner of the many future furiants.

He won four caps for Wales between 1905 and 1906 and most notably was a member of the winning Welsh team against the original All Blacks. International career 1905 Wales squad, Williams, back row, second from left Of all the Welsh players who made up the 1905 \\"Champions of the World\\" team, Williams is the most enigmatic. Over his career he achieved by far the lowest number of international caps out of the 1905 team and played the majority of his career outside Wales. It was said that Williams was a good kicker of the ball and \\"could pick up like a half, pass like a centre and run like a wing\\". During his club career with London Welsh he captained the club during the 1907/08 season. Williams began playing rugby while in school at Christ College, Brecon. After moving to London, he joined Welsh exile club London Welsh, also turning out for English side Richmond. Williams made his international debut against Ireland on 11 March 1905 while playing for London Welsh. He was chosen for the 1905 All Blacks game and he proved an excellent choice working well with Harding and Hodges to back up Dai Jones in the pack and line out.Smith (1980), pg 162. Williams short international career ended in the disastrous 1906 South African game, where dissent surrounding the pack resulted in a Welsh team without cohesion. The selectors decided a 'clean sweep' was required and very few of that team, including Williams, played for Wales again.Smith (1980), pg 188. In 1908 Williams was chosen to join Harding's Anglo-Welsh team who toured Australia and New Zealand. =International matches played= WalesSmith (1980), pg 473. * Ireland 1905 * New Zealand 1905 * Scotland 1906 * South Africa 1906 =British Isles= * New Zealand 1908 Later career and death In 1910, Williams was sent to Northern Nigeria, by the Colonial Office to work in the capacity of a commissioner. It was recorded in The Sportsman that shortly after assuming his post, Williams was shot by a local. The paper went on to state that Williams had recovered from the bullet wound, and that the shooting had been an accident. Williams died the next year, at the age of 28, after contracting blackwater fever in Nigeria while on Colonial Service.

Monsteroso (Amazing Adventures) Monsteroso is a giant monster in Marvel Comics. It first appeared in Amazing Adventures #5 (Oct 1961), and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. =Fictional character history= Monsteroso first appeared as an unnamed young passenger on an alien spacecraft passing near Earth. He accidentally launched himself in the vessel's lifeboat towards Earth, which crashed in Africa. Monsteroso was knocked unconscious in the impact.Amazing Adventures vol. 1 #5 (Oct 1961) The unconscious, almost comatose Monsteroso was discovered by a man named Phil, a circus owner from the United States. Thinking the creature dead, Phil had its body brought to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. It is Phil who first names the creature \\"Monsteroso\\". After healing, Monsteroso revives in the museum. The young alien, confused by its surroundings began rampaging through the city. The police attempted to stop him with conventional force (i.e. bullets and tear gas), unsuccessfully. Meanwhile, Phil realizes that Monsteroso's nature was childlike, not evil, and he convinced an Army scientist to sedate, rather than kill, the creature. After scaling the United Nations building, it is successfully sedated, and falls into the East River. Immediately afterwards, an enormous spacecraft lands, and two enormous aliens disembark, Monsteroso's parents. They retrieve their child and prepare to depart, saying: \\"It is fortunate that he is unharmed! Fortunate for you!\\" The story of Monsteroso's origin was reprinted in Marvel Comics' Monsters on the Prowl #28 (June, 1974). Monsteroso (Tales to Astonish) Monsteroso is another (apparently) giant monster in Marvel Comics. It first appeared in Tales to Astonish #18 (Apr 1961), and was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. =Fictional character history= This Monsteroso was hatched in solitude from an egg on a planet apparently devoid of intelligent life otherwise. Soon after his birth, Monsteroso began to uncontrollably grow in size, larger and larger, with no apparent upper limit. Eventually, Monsteroso dwarfed even massive geological features like mountains. Being so large, Monsteroso hailed himself as conqueror and ruler of all he surveyed, until a flood came in which Monsteroso drowned. The \\"flood\\" was subsequently revealed to be a scientist washing out a glass slide, utterly unaware of the microscopic ecosystem that had lived within it.Tales to Astonish vol. 1 #18 (Apr 1961) In later mentions in the Marvel Universe, this Monsteroso was said to be an inhabitant of the Microverse.Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #7, s. v. \\"Microverse\\" The first appearance of this Monsteroso was reprinted in Fantasy Masterpieces #9 (June 1967).

The concerts present new and original work from all musical periods, ranging from medieval tropes and Vietnamese work songs through recent European and American music to newly commissioned Australian compositions. Each Astra program is planned as an event that engages the audience with the stimulus of contrasting materials, extending from the sound of voices to combinations with instruments, electro-acoustics, text and theatre.See http://www.astramusic.org.au Astra also publishes CD recordings of the work of the Astra Choir and associated artists. It also has a continuing project to publish scores of the works of the influential Australian composer, performer and educator Keith Humble.  History  Astra was formed in 1951 as an orchestra of women musicians under the direction of Madame Asta Flack, a violinist and conductor who had migrated to Australia from Lithuania.Campbell, Peter. 'And there came all manner of choirs: Melbourne's burgeoning choral scene since 1950' [online]. Context: Journal of Music Research; Issue 25; Autumn 2003; [41]-54. Availability: . In 1958, George Logie-Smith became Musical Director, extending the orchestra to include men and a larger wind section and founding the Astra Choir. Over a period of 20 years, he developed links with Australian composers as well as giving performance of choral and chamber orchestral repertoire rarely heard at that time (for example the Bach Passions, Stravinsky's Les Noces, and works by Bartok, Britten, Penderecki et al.) Since John McCaughey became Musical Director in 1978, the Astra Choir has provided the principal focus of concerts, joined by many of Australia's leading contemporary instrumental performers as guests. Robert Smallwood was Director of Astra in the period 1983-4, and other guest directors (Joan Pollock, Graeme Leak, Kenneth Gaburo, Sue Healey, Anne Thompson, William Henderson and Allan Walker) have extended the Choir's work into the domains of film, dance and improvisation. Since 1978, Astra has performed over 1280 individual works by about 430 composers (170 of them Australian) in almost 70 different venues throughout Melbourne and regional Victoria.See  Funding  Astra is funded by the Australia Council for the Arts, Arts Victoria, the William Angliss Trust, Diana Gibson and a number of private benefactors.  Awards  Astra's contribution to musical and performing life in Australia has been recognised by numerous awards and commissions including: * Sidney Myer Performing Arts Award 1987 * Australian Music Centre's 1998 National Award for the Best Australian Composition (for Lawrence Whiffin's 'Murchitt - a Daydream'), * Australian Music Centre's 2000 National and Victorian Awards for Outstanding Contribution to Australian Music to Astra's Director, John McCaughey  References  Australian choirs Music organisations based in Australia Sheet music publishing companies Music publishing companies of Australia Musical groups established in 1951 1951 establishments in Australia ","title":"Astra Chamber Music Society"},{"id":"18564364","title":"Bruno Toledo"},{"id":"18564379","text":"Fearless is Cowboy Mouth's eleventh release and eighth studio album, released September 23, 2008.

Yaphet Kotto, Eartha Kitt, Scatman Crothers and Carl Weathers co-starred. It is an adaptation of the 1970-74 eponymous syndicated newspaper comic strip, scripted by Jim Lawrence and illustrated by Jorge Longarón. This was Grier's final film with American International Pictures. The tagline on the film's poster is \\"Wham! Bam! Here comes Pam!\\" Plot Friday Foster (Grier) is an ex-magazine model turned magazine photographer who refuses to heed her boss's admonitions against becoming involved in the stories to which she is assigned. After witnessing an assassination attempt on the nation's wealthiest African American, Blake Tarr (Thalmus Rasulala), and then seeing her best friend Cloris Boston (Miles) murdered, Friday finds herself targeted for death. She teams up with private detective Colt Hawkins (Kotto) to investigate, and soon the two are hot on the trail of a plot to eliminate the country's African- American political leadership.

Black unity and self- determination preached the unification of all blacks, regardless of class, gender and nation, under a common struggle and oppressor in order to create their own nationhood. Friday Foster touches on the national and local levels of Black unity and self-determination through family, community and commerce.  The black family, the next generation and the black community  Uplifting the black family was an important part of black unity and self- determination. The black family, especially black women, was expected to play an important role in shaping the next generation. Although the viewer never see who Friday's parents are, her younger brother, Cleave, whom she cares for, is a presence in the film. Cleave represents the next generation in this film. He is intelligent, young, brave, and quick-witted, as can be seen from his interactions with the neighborhood pimp, Fancy, but also innocent. Friday's mission to find and have the hitmen arrested is also a mission to protect her younger brother (the next generation). This mission becomes clear in the scene where the hitman tries to kill Friday in her apartment. Her younger brother, not knowing anything about the present danger directs the hitman to their apartment. In doing this, the film induces fear, not only for Friday's life, but her bother's also. As we are to assume that Friday is his only family, if she were to die, her brother would become an orphan and might fall victim to the common traps of black life: poverty, drugs, gangs, etc. Grier herself talks about the disintegration of black family in an interview with Ebony. > People are not going to church anymore. There's more corruption, more kids > dropping out, more young girls from the ages for 13 to 16 who are becoming > pregnant. Families have disintegrated. Our parents aren't as strict today. > They're not showing that hard, firm love like they used to. I feel we have > just lost respect for one another as human beings. Protecting the next generation from the criminal life would give them the opportunity to be better educated than the last and be leaders in the community and promote Black unity. Education was an important part of Black Power. It was believed that \\"treating black children as creative, educable beings (rather than aberrant or dysfunctional ones), these revamped institutions would emphasize racial and cultural difference in a positive way --by nurturing a youngster's sense of self and instilling respect for collective responsibility and action.\\" By doing this, every generation would come and help build their community in the same way that they were helped. The film introduces viewers to comedic versions of two common characters within the Black community—the Black cop and the pimp. Although comedic, these characters are essential to the themes of Black Power that reverberate throughout the film. As expressed by Stokely Carmichael, \\"... black Americans have two problems: they are poor and they are black. All other problems arise form this two-sided reality: lack of education, the so-called apathy of black men.\\" These characters are a part of a disillusioned older generation caught in the claws of systemic oppression, poverty and being Black. The cop is portrayed as lazy, when in reality he is probably overworked and disillusioned by his job. Throughout the film, he is constantly asking for a beer and refuses to investigate the murder of Cloris any further despite the insistence from Friday and Colt based on evidence. The cop is a representation of what happens when Black people work for a government that does not support them and understand that justice will never land on their side. On the other hand, Fancy, the pimp, is a representation of what could happen to Black men when they are not protected and properly educated, because of poverty. Both of these men represent possibilities for Cleve's future if Friday cannot protect him.  Black commerce  In the film, there are a lot of Black business owners and Black bosses, for example, Friday's boss at Glance Magazine. Although it is unclear as to whether or not he owns the magazine, it is clear that he has a lot of power and influence in the city. He is able to get Friday out of jail after she steals the hearse and even the white antagonist acknowledges the power of Glance Magazine backing Friday in her plans to stop Black Widow. The film also shows a Black female business owner, Madam Rena, the fashion designer who has connections to some of the richest men in D.C. Beyond the already established businesses, the movie also promotes the idea of educating the young in commerce. The first time the movie shows Cleve, he is counting money in a closet filled with presents. Further into the movie, it is shown that he is getting this money by selling the gifts that Fancy brings for Friday. When asked whether or not he is hustling now, he responds, \\"Nope, strictly Black capitalism.\\"Friday Foster. Dir. Arthur Marks. Perf. Pam Grier. 1975. Online Rental. Generating wealth within the Black community and teaching the young about the systems of economics would give the community the opportunity to rebuild and create a better nation.  Black politics and the threat of white supremacy  In the midst of solving the murder of two of her friends as well as the attempted murder of Black billionaire, Blake Tarr, Friday uncovers a political movement that plans to unify all of the black politicians. As the movie shows, this would be the first time the Black politicians all worked together to tear down \\"walls of prejudice and discrimination.\\" The unity of Black politicians would mean a stronger Black presence in government and Black power. Going back to Stokely Carmichael, \\"Politically, black power means what it has always meant to SNCC: the coming- together of black people to elect representatives and to force those representatives to speak to their needs.\\" This is harmful to the system that is already in place and does not work for the enrichment of the Black community. A stronger Black presence in government would also mean that the government would have to acknowledge and work to fix Black problems. In order to do this, it would have to restructure the system. However, the omnipresent threat of White supremacy is always a problem. In the movie, this threat is working to destroy Black Power by killing all of the Black leaders a part of the movement for Black political unity. \\"Suppose you wanted to destroy Black Power. What better way then to get all the leaders together and wipe them out.\\" This shows the length that white supremacists would go to stop equality. This isn't a far stretch considering that many leaders of the Civil Rights Movement were either assassinated or attacked to stop the movement. The most disturbing part however, is that the person coordinating the attack for the white man is a black man, Charles Folley. This confuses Friday, who doesn't understand how someone Black could work against their own community. But, as the senator points out, \\"Some n****** will do anything for a dollar.\\" This demonstrates the need for Black unity and commerce as a means of getting out of poverty and the white man's money. Gender issues Grier said,\\"I took the parts no other Hollywood starlet would touch because they didn't want to be demeaned or mess up their nails. It was a risk but I didn't know any better and somehow I came out on top\\" in response to a question about the heavy sexual visuals in her films. She also made the point of saying that she took those roles, because they were the only ones available to Black actresses at the time. However, as she gained more autonomy she was able to control how her character was portrayed in films. This film has less nudity than Grier's more popular films Foxy Brown and Coffy, but it also says a lot about the treatment of women during this period. In Friday Foster, the protagonist is a brave, intelligent woman who refuses to sit on the sidelines while the men take all the action. However, the empowered protagonist is still affected by sexism. = Sexism and Black feminism = In her interview with Ebony magazine, Grier says, \\"Half the black men do not respect women. They do not respect their little sisters; they're still using profanity in front of them.\\" This type of sexism is prevalent in Friday Foster. Although educated, Friday still has to use her body in order to get the results and information that she wants from the male characters. For example, when going to take pictures of Blake Tarr, she flirts heavily with airport security in order to pass him. Although he knows what she is there for, he still entertains her attempts before he lets her in. This shows how women were forced to obtain power through men during the time. Many Black women during this time were expected to raise families or, if they wanted to be actively a part of the Black Power movement, answer phones and support the men. Most famous women that were a part of the Black Panther Party were famous by their association to Black men.Gore, Dayo F., Jeanne Theoharis, and Komozi Woodard, eds. Want to Start a Revolution?: Radical Women in the Black Freedom Struggle. NYU Press, 2009. This is shown in the movie when Ford Malotte tells her \\"Go home, get laid, have a baby\\" and says to Colt, her male companion, \\"Tell your liberated little woman ...\\" By doing this, he is dismissing her using her gender role and telling the man to control her. Unfortunately, that isn't the only bout of sexism that she or the other women in the film encounter. When Cloris's death is said to happen, because of a drug scandal, Friday tries to tell the police differently and he dismisses her by repeatedly asking her about the drugs. However, the fact that the protagonist of the film is a woman who perseveres despite being belittled by the men surrounding her shows how the movie also reflects feminist issues. Grier told Jet magazine, \\"I want to show them I'm not just another body for the camera but a serious actress.\\" Similarly, Friday is attempting to show the men that she is a real journalist. She also reflects on the intersectionality of her identities as a Black woman. In the film, when Blake Tarr asks about her she says, \\"First, I'm a woman.\\" See also * List of American films of 1975  References External links 1975 films 1970s action thriller films African-American drama films American action thriller films American films American International Pictures films American neo-noir films Blaxploitation films English-language films Films about photojournalists Films about race and ethnicity Films based on American comics Films based on comic strips Films directed by Arthur Marks Films set in Los Angeles Live-action films based on comics ","title":"Friday Foster (film)"},{"id":"18564382","title":"Wilbroad Axweso"},{"id":"18564404","text":"Muvattupuzha was a Lok Sabha constituency in Kerala.

History The original building was designed and constructed by architect Americo Maini in 1908. It was founded in 1885 and originally located on 85 Gabriel Pereira Street. It shared the premises with Escuela No. 18 – Noruega (School No. 18 Norway). In 1904 the government bought the parcel of land located on what was then Avenida de los Pocitos (Avenue of the Pocitos) and is now called Avenida Brasil (Brazil Avenue). On November 15, 1927 the school was named Brazil. From 1949 until 2002 the school shared the premises with Escuela No. 71 Baron de Rio Branco (School No. 71). Since 1993 it had been considered a building of local interest and in 2002 was declared a National Heritage Site by resolution 1.448/002 of the Ministry of Education and Culture. The design and in particular its tiled roof, main entrance and its railings are an outstanding example of modernist architecture, which is quite common in Pocitos. The main entrance of the old building is on Avenida Brasil 2963, while the school occupies most of the block between streets Avenida Brasil, 26 de Marzo and José Martí. Behind the left wing of the original building has been annexed a building originally designed with 3 levels, of which only 2 levels were constructed. The annex was designed to expand the leasable capacity of this institution. With the same purpose, architect Marcelo de Vita projected classrooms for temporary use in 1969. At the same time and by the same architect, the gym was designed, which was built after the construction of the annexed building along with two accesses from Jose Marti street.

Salvadoran immigration to Australia was caused principally by economic and political turmoil in El Salvador.  History  The largest flow occurred when refugees left El Salvador during the Salvadoran Civil War in the 1980s. The first wave were former political prisoners whose immigration was facilitated by the Special Humanitarian Program in 1983. After this first group, which consisted of 75 people, another 10,000 Salvadorans arrived in Australia by 1986. Subsequent groups came—not directly from El Salvador—but from lesser-developed countries like Mexico and Costa Rica that housed Salvadoran refugees. Most Salvadoran-born Australians came prior to 2001; little followed after the civil war. The majority of Salvadorians that live in Australia are of white and mestizo ancestry. The majority of Salvadorans in Australia reside in Melbourne, From El Salvador to Australia (32%), followed by Brisbane, (21%), and Sydney, (18%).ABS Census - ethnicity Census data records showed 25% of Salvadoran Australians work in managerial or professional roles. A further 23% work in production, transport and trades; 20% are labourers. Many migrants from El Salvador are skilled workers, but their lack of fluent English forced them into unskilled jobs. Over 92% speak Spanish at home, and the majority are Catholic. Evangelical born-again Christians of Salvadoran descent exist in increasing numbers.History of immigration from El Salvador A 2006 estimation placed the Salvadorian population as high as 18,755.El Salvador en el Mundo (Spanish) Ethnicity Many of the immigrants are of mixed European and Native American (mestizo) ancestry. Salvadorans typically have European , Native American and West African ancestry. Most of them are mestizo or white. Indigenous Salvadorans make up only one percent of the population and are mostly of Pipil and Lenca ancestries; some are Mayan. Many of the biracial, mixed and White Caucasian Salvadorans (and other Central Americans) descend from Spain, Italy, Portugal, Germany, France, Ireland, Poland, and other European countries. Many Jews emigrated to El Salvador during World War Two as refugees with the help of José Castellanos Contreras.

A subsidiary of Dell, their flagship product, the Ocarina Appliance/Reader, released in April 2008, uses patented data compression techniques incorporating such methods as record linkage and context-based lossless data compression. The product includes the hardware-appliance-based compressor, the Ocarina Optimizer (Models 2400, 3400, 4600) and a real-time decompressor, the software-based Ocarina Reader. History Ocarina was founded by * Murli Thirumale, formerly a vice-president and general manager at Citrix Systems; * Carter George, formerly a vice-president and co-founder of PolyServe (acquired by HP); and * Goutham Rao, formerly Chief Technical Officer and Chief Architect for Advanced Solutions Group of Citrix Systems. Its solution works by identifying redundancy at a global file system level, and applying specific algorithms for different data formats, such as algorithms specific to images, text, executables, seismic data, and other \\"unstructured data\\". Ocarina's Optimizers work with existing storage systems through standard network protocols such as NFS, or are directly integrated with partner vendors storage systems. On July 19, 2010, Dell announced it plans to acquire Ocarina Networks. The transaction was completed on July 31, 2010.Dell Signs Agreement to Acquire Ocarina Networks and its Storage Optimization Technology Dell Website 2010-07-19 Retrieved 2010-07-29 In late 2010, the original Ocarina Optimizer product family was removed from the market, enabling the Ocarina team to focus on the integration of dedupe and compression into Dell storage products. The most notable examples were the DR-family of deduplication appliances, launched in 2012, and integration of dedupe into Dell's Fluid File System. Technology The company's ECOsystem (Extract, Correlate, Optimize) provided data reduction technology, providing both deduplication and content- aware data compression in a reliable, scalable, policy-based package. ECOsystem consists of 3 primary components, an optimizer, a reader, and a management and reporting framework. These components were delivered in software or appliance form depending on customer, application, and underlying storage solution. The standard ECOsystem workflow was a post-process. Files were first stored to disk in native form. Policies are used to specify which files were to be optimized (based on age, location, or file type), and what compression settings to use. Policies were commonly used to avoid optimization of files that are actively being modified. ECOsystem could also be configured to migrate optimized data to a secondary tier of lower-cost storage for disk- based archival applications. =Compression and deduplication algorithms= ECOsystem was content aware, with selection of compression solution based on the type of data being processed. This went beyond file-extension filtering. ECOsystem recursively decomposed compound files, until elemental text, media, or binary components are identified. At the heart of the optimizer software is a context-weighted neural net that will apply the most effective compression solution based on the nature of the elemental file component identified, and will efficiently remember optimal settings based on similar files processed. ECOsystem in most cases is highly effective at achieving results on novel or proprietary file-types, as well as pre-compressed media such as JPEG images and MPEG4 video. Ocarina successfully processed data in over 600 file formats to-date. =ECOmax and NFO workflows= Two forms of Ocarina's post-processing workflow were available: * ECOmax and * Native Format Optimization (NFO). ECOmax utilized all available compression methods to shrink data, including on-disk structures that maximized utilization of physical blocks. The ECOmax workflow required the use of the ECOreader, which is run-anywhere software that efficiently decodes data for transparent read-back. ECOmax could be applied to any file or data types including specialized files used by various vertical industries. The NFO workflow is designed specifically for web-based media companies. In NFO, media files (for example JPEGs) were stored in their native state, which eliminates the need for decoding, and allows customers to capture data-reduction benefits throughout the workflow, including web distribution (bandwidth savings and better end-user experience), and movement into archival systems. NFO provided \\"visually identical\\" compression that tailors image parameters to the sensitivities of the Human Visual System Model, and the intended use of the image, without creating any perceivable quality degradation. Note that many of the features and capabilities of the Ocarina ECOsystem were not included in later Dell products. Funding * In 2007, Ocarina Networks secured $12M in series 'A' funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Highland Capital Partners, * In 2009, Ocarina secured an additional $20M from the same investors and JAFCO Ventures.

When \\\\eta>1 the curve approaches the horizontal axis asymptotically with no lower bound. In economics, the isoelastic function for utility, also known as the isoelastic utility function, or power utility function is used to express utility in terms of consumption or some other economic variable that a decision-maker is concerned with. The isoelastic utility function is a special case of hyperbolic absolute risk aversion and at the same time is the only class of utility functions with constant relative risk aversion, which is why it is also called the CRRA utility function. It is : u(c) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{c^{1-\\\\eta}-1}{1-\\\\eta} & \\\\eta \\\\ge 0, \\\\eta eq 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ln(c) & \\\\eta = 1 \\\\end{cases} where c is consumption, u(c) the associated utility, and \\\\eta is a constant that is positive for risk averse agents. Since additive constant terms in objective functions do not affect optimal decisions, the term –1 in the numerator can be, and usually is, omitted (except when establishing the limiting case of \\\\ln(c) as below). When the context involves risk, the utility function is viewed as a von Neumann–Morgenstern utility function, and the parameter \\\\eta is the degree of relative risk aversion. The isoelastic utility function is a special case of the hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) utility functions, and is used in analyses that either include or do not include underlying risk.  Empirical parametrization  There is substantial debate in the economics and finance literature with respect to the empirical value of \\\\eta. While relatively high values of \\\\eta (as high as 50 in some models) are necessary to explain the behavior of asset prices, some controlled experiments have documented behavior that is more consistent with values of \\\\eta as low as one.  Risk aversion features  This and only this utility function has the feature of constant relative risk aversion. Mathematically this means that -c \\\\cdot u(c)/u'(c) is a constant, specifically In theoretical models this often has the implication that decision-making is unaffected by scale. For instance, in the standard model of one risk-free asset and one risky asset, under constant relative risk aversion the fraction of wealth optimally placed in the risky asset is independent of the level of initial wealth. Reprinted in:  Special cases  * \\\\eta=0: this corresponds to risk neutrality, because utility is linear in c. * \\\\eta=1: by virtue of l'Hôpital's rule, the limit of u(c) is \\\\ln c as \\\\eta goes to 1: ::\\\\lim_{\\\\eta\\\\rightarrow1}\\\\frac{c^{1-\\\\eta}-1}{1-\\\\eta}=\\\\ln(c) :which justifies the convention of using the limiting value u(c) = ln c when \\\\eta=1. * \\\\eta → \\\\infty: this is the case of infinite risk aversion.

A brief history of Malladi Satyalingam Naicker  Malladi Satyalingam Naicker belongs to the Agnikulakshatriya Community. He was born at Coringa, a small village near Kakinada about 1843. Coringa had at one time commanded an over-seas trade and was a prosperous place. Satyalingam's ancestors were in foreign trade and rich. This prosperous foreign business came to an end during Satyalingam's father's tenure. His ships were wrecked at sea, and the family was reduced to poverty. Karri Narayana Swamy, his maternal uncle, who owned some ships and was doing foreign business took him and his widowed mother under his care. Instead of learning lessons, Satyalingam spent his time playing with other truants in the village. Satyalingam came to know that one of his uncle's ships were being fitted to set sail to Mullein (Moulmein) in Burma. He requested his uncle to let him be a mate in the ship. The sympathetic uncle entrusted him to the care of the captain (Nakhoda) and thus Satyalingam's life changed from India to Burma. When the ship had reached the port at Moulmein, a major port in Burma at that time, the boy Satyalingam gave them a slip one night and disappeared from the ship. The captain and his men searched for the boy for a month, but in vain. The helpless widow, the boy's mother, died of a broken heart. Satyalingam's integrity in business dealings soon won for him the respect and confidence of European business magnates in Rangoon. He undertook the business of supplying labour to the mill on a contract basis. In two years, he amassed more than one lakh rupees. He used to lend up to Rs. 50,000 to the mill itself. He purchased two steam launches and employed a number of clerks to assist him in his business. Satyalingam, the good–for-nothing lad of Coringa became the master of Lakhs and returned to Coringa, married at the instance of his relatives and went back to Rangoon again. But some years later his wife died. He adopted a son known as Sri Subrahmanyam Naicker. Satyalingam Naicker died in Rangoon on 29 January 1915 when he was about 75 years old.

Migration history The earliest Korean migrants to Chile were soldiers of the North Korean army captured by United Nations forces, who declined repatriation after the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and came to Chile under the auspices of the Red Cross. They were resettled in the city of Temuco. Immigration from South Korea to Chile would not begin until 1970, when five families came to work in the floriculture sector. Three more families came by way of Bolivia in 1975, and another ten in 1976. By 1978, the year of the founding of the Asociación Coreana de Chile, there were between twenty and thirty Korean families residing in Chile. In 1978, twenty Korean families founded a school, the Colegio Coreano, with the assistances of the Presbyterian Church to offer weekend courses in Korean language, culture, and history to Korean children in Chile. Most of the families immigrating in those days actually had Argentina as their final destination, and intended to reside in Chile only as long as it took them to obtain an Argentine visa, but as Argentina required prospective immigrants to have at least US$30,000 in capital, many found themselves unable to qualify; they instead settled in Chile, where the requirement was merely one-sixth that amount. Many settled in the Barrio Patronato, a traditionally immigrant-dominated neighbourhood then filled largely with Arabs. They started out in the textile manufacturing sector, but along with Chile's shift away from an import substitution-oriented economic model, they turned to opening shops and importing clothing and other products from their homeland instead. Between 1997 and 2005, the Korean population of Chile grew by one-quarter, from 1,470 to 1,858 individuals, surpassing in size the community of Koreans in Peru. Afterwards, the population continued to grow, to 2,510 by 2011. South Korean governments showed a total of 48 ethnic Koreans with Chilean nationality, 2,366 with permanent residency, seven international students, and 119 with other types of visas. Inter-ethnic relations Koreans in Chile are respected by Chileans of other backgrounds for their work ethic, but are perceived as a very closed community, especially with regards to interracial marriage. The Korean shops of Patronato are well known for their low prices and diverse products but some Chileans and competitors feel some envy towards the commercial success of Koreans in their country. At the same time, however, Chileans have respect for the rapid economic development undertaken by South Korea. On the other hand, Koreans in Chile often perceive Chileans as superficial in their friendships, lazy, irresponsible, and somewhat racist. Religion Among the Korean community in Chile, Protestantism is the majority religion; Patronato has two Presbyterian churches and one Roman Catholic one. Many Korean migrants to Chile were not Christians at the time of their arrival, but became churchgoers in order to take part in the specifically Korean social life offered by the churches, which offered them comfort and reminders of home after the stressful experience of migration to a foreign country.

The name literally means \\"wolf\\". Vuk Karadžić, 19th-century Serbian philologist and ethnographer, explained the traditional, apotropaic use of the name: a woman who had lost several babies in succession, would name her newborn son Vuk, because it was believed that the witches, who \\"ate\\" the babies, were afraid to attack the wolves. In the Serbian epic poetry, the wolf is a symbol of fearlessness. Vuk was the 17th most popular name for boys in Serbia in the period 2003–2005.\\"Najpopularnija imena u Srbiji\\" (in Serbian). ogrlicezabebe.com There are many given names derived from the noun vuk. The following are male names recorded among the Serbs by the 19th century: Vukaj, Vuko, Vukoje, Vukovoj, Vukovoje, Vukal, Vukalj, Vukajlo, Vukola, Vukel, Vukelja, Vukula, Vukan, Vukolin, Vukota, Vukić, Vukadin, Vukac, Vukas, Vuksan, Vukač, Vukašin, Vukša, Vukdrag, Vukman, Vukoman, Vukmir, Vukomir, Vukmilj, Vukoslav, Vukosav, Dobrovuk, Vučo, Vučko, Vučela, Vučan, Vučen, Vučin, Vučihna, Vučina, Vučeta, Vučić, Vučkulin, Vujo, Vujan, Vujat, Vujadin, Vujin, Vujeta, Vujčeta, Vujčin, Vujić, Vujko, Vujak, Vujica, Vujača, Vujaš, Vule, Vulina, Vulić, Vulic, and Vuleš. There are also female names derived from vuk: Vuka, Vukana, Vujana, Vukava, Vučica, Vukadinka, Vujadinka, Vukmira, Vukomirka, Vukomanka, and Vukosava.\\"Именослов српских имена\\" (in Serbian). Serbian Orthodox Parish of Lucerne, Switzerland All the derivatives from vuk were regarded as apotropaic names. In the period 2003–2005, Vukašin was the 30th and Vukan the 82nd most popular name for boys in Serbia. The name Vuk is recorded in Serbian sources dating before 1400 in the form of Vlk (Old Cyrillic: ), with a syllabic l. Through a sound change in Serbian that took place after 1400, the syllabic l turned into the vowel u. In this way Vlk became Vuk, and by the same process the initial Vuk- and Vuč- in the derivatives developed from Vlk- and Vlč-; e.g., Vukašin from Vlkašin. The names Vujo and Vule are the bases for the derivatives starting with Vuj- and Vul-. They are formed from vuk on the same pattern as the pet names Brajo and Brale are formed from brat \\"brother\\". The given name Vlk and its derivatives, Vlkoň, Vlček, and Vlčata for males, and Vlkava and Vlčenka for females, were recorded among the Czechs, while Wilkan was recorded among the Poles.

Migration history The first migrants from South Korea to Guatemala did not arrive in the country until 1985, more than two decades after South Korean mass migration to Latin America began. As recently as 1997, only 2,051 Koreans resided in the country, but by 2005, that number had almost quintupled to 9,944, surpassing the older community of Koreans in Paraguay and giving Guatemala the fourth-largest Korean population in the region, behind Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico. From 2005 to 2009, the number of Koreans in the country remained roughly stable at 9,921 persons. However, in the following two years the number of South Korean nationals in the country grew by 30%, reaching 12,918 persons. Among them 3,101 were permanent residents, 52 were international students, and 9,765 had other kinds of visas. The population exhibits gender imbalance, with 7,409 women (57%) compared to 5,509 men (43%), a sex ratio of 134 to 100. Almost all live in Guatemala City, with only 38 recorded as living in Antigua or other cities. Business and employment The earliest migrants were involved in the textiles industry, setting up factories to produce garments for export to the United States market. From 1988 to 1991, fifty South Korean-owned maquilas opened in Guatemala. The value of their exports, at $150 million per year, comprised half of all Guatemalan apparel exports. As of 2001, there were thirty-three Korean restaurants in the capital; other Korean residents operate karaoke bars, mini-supermarkets, book cafes, and clothing stores. In some cases, wives and children remain in Guatemala doing business while their husbands return to Korea. Products from South Korean-owned businesses are reported to make up 10% of Guatemala's total exports. Community relations Guatemalans perceive the Korean community as fairly insular and isolated. South Korean media portray the Korean community in Guatemala as living in constant fear of their lives due to endemic violence in the country, a portrayal which the Guatemalan embassy in Seoul strongly disputes. According to the Korean embassy, twenty-four Koreans have become the victims of violent crime in Guatemala between 2003 and 2008. In March 2009, a pair of South Korean businessmen Sang Park and Bang Mal-sum were murdered in a suburb of the capital. Because they are involved in international business and thus believed to be rich, South Koreans are perceived by the general population as attractive targets for kidnapping, especially in comparison to Americans. In total in 13 months up to February 2010 there were eight cases of murders of South Koreans, along with numerous kidnappings. In February 2010, two South Koreans who ran an illegal casino were arrested for the abduction and murder of Suong Kim, another South Korean who had won money in the casino. Organisations There is an Association of Koreans in Guatemala (Asociación de Coreanos en Guatemala), headed by Lim Byung-yeol. The association has organised a variety of activities, including a sports day at Parque la Democracia in May 2011. That year, the association also began conducting a statistical survey of the community. There is also a Korean School of Guatemala (Colegio Coreano de Guatemala, ), which had 29 teachers and 170 students . Octavio Kang, a graduate of the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, publishes a newspaper aimed at the community; about three-tenths of its articles are about Guatemala and the Korean community there, with the rest concerning happenings in South Korea. However, it has only 350 subscribers.

Singh was enlisted in the British Indian Army in 1941 and served in the Second World War, fighting against the Japanese in Burma. He later took part in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 as a member of the Indian Army. For an action on 6 February 1948 at Tain Dhar, to the north of Naushahra, Naik Singh was awarded the Param Vir Chakra. Singh commanded a nine-man forward section post. Though heavily outnumbered by advancing Pakistani forces, Singh led his men in defending against three attempts to overtake the post. He was wounded during the second assault. Armed with a Sten gun, he single-handedly charged the third assault with such determination as to cause the attackers to withdraw. In doing so, he was killed. A sports stadium in Shahjahanpur and a crude oil tanker were named after Singh.  Early life  Singh was born on 21 November 1916 in Khajuri village of Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh in a Rathore Rajput family. He was the son of Birbal Singh Rathore, a farmer, and Jamuna Kanwar. He was the third of eight children, with six brothers and a sister. Though Singh studied up to fourth year standard in a local school in his village, he could not continue his education further due to his family's economic situation. He spent most of his childhood helping out his family with agricultural work around the farm. For recreation, he wrestled and eventually became the wrestling champion of his village. For his character and well- being, he was nicknamed \\"Hanuman Bhagat Bal Brahmachari\\". This was after Hanuman, a Hindu god who was unmarried for life. Singh never married. Military career Naik Jadunath Singh Memorial at Taindhar Top near Naushera J&K; During the Second World War, Singh enlisted in the 7th Rajput Regiment of the British Indian Army, on 21 November 1941 at Fatehgarh Regimental Centre. On completing his training, Singh was posted to the regiment's 1st Battalion. During late 1942, the battalion was deployed to the Arakan Province during the Burma campaign, where they fought against the Japanese. The battalion was part of the 47th Indian Infantry Brigade, assigned to the 14th Indian Infantry Division. It fought actions around the Mayu Range in late 1942 and early 1943, advancing up the Mayu Peninsula towards Donbaik as part of an operation to recapture Akyab Island. Although the Rajputs were held up around the cluster of villages called Kondan in December 1942, the advance slowly continued towards Donbaik. It was there, where the brigade's attack ground to a halt and they were subsequently relieved by the 55th Indian Infantry Brigade in early February 1943. In early April, the Japanese counterattacked. The 47th Brigade became cut off around Indan and eventually split off into small groups to fight their way back to Allied lines. The surviving members of the brigade returned to India. In 1945, Singh's battalion was assigned to the 2nd Indian Infantry Brigade and took over the defence of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The islands had been partially occupied by the Japanese forces, which surrendered on 7 October 1945. After returning to India, Singh was promoted to the rank of Naik (corporal). After the partition, the 7th Rajput Regiment was assigned to the Indian Army. Singh remained with the newly raised Indian regiment, continuing to serve in its 1st Battalion. =War of 1947= In October 1947, following an offensive by the Pakistani raiders in Jammu and Kashmir, the Defence Committee of the Indian Cabinet directed the Army Headquarters to undertake a military response. The Army planned several operations to drive out the raiders as directed. In one such operation, the 50th Para Brigade, to which the Rajput Regiment was attached, was ordered to secure Naushahra and establish a base at Jhangar in mid-November. Bad weather prevented this action and on 24 December, Jhangar, a strategically advantageous position in the Naushahra Sector, was captured by the Pakistanis which gave them control over the communication lines between Mirpur and Poonch (town) and provided a starting point from which attacks could be made on Naushahra. The following month, the Indian Army undertook several operations in the north-west of Naushahra to stop further advances by the Pakistani forces. Brigadier Mohammad Usman, the commanding officer of the 50th Para Brigade, had made necessary arrangements to counter the expected attack. Soldiers were deployed in small groups on possible enemy approaches. Tain Dhar, lying to the north of Naushahra, was one such approach for which Singh's battalion was responsible. On the morning of 6 February 1948, at 6:40 am IST, Pakistani forces opened fire on pickets from the battalion patrolling along Tain Dhar ridge. Gunfire was exchanged between both sides. The foggy early morning darkness helped the attacking Pakistanis creep up to the pickets. Soon, men in the posts on the Tain Dhar ridge observed a large number of Pakistani soldiers moving towards them. Singh was in command of the nine personnel manning the forward post of the second picket at Tain Dhar. Singh and his section were able to ward off three successive attempts by Pakistani forces to capture their position. By the end of third wave, of the 27 men at the post, 24 were dead or severely wounded. Singh being a section commander at the post, displayed \\"exemplary\\" leadership, and kept motivating his men till he succumbed to his wounds. This proved a very critical moment for the battle at Naushahra. In the meantime, Brigadier Usman sent a company of the 3rd (Para) Battalion, Rajput Regiment, to reinforce Tain Dhar. Without Singh engaging the Pakistani troops for a considerable period, re-capture of these posts would have been impossible.  Param Vir Chakra Singh was posthumously awarded the India's highest military decoration, the Param Vir Chakra for his actions on 6 February 1948. The official citation is as follows: Legacy National War Memorial, New Delhi The Shipping Corporation of India (SCI), an Indian Government enterprise under the Ministry of Shipping, named fifteen of her crude oil tankers in honour of the Param Vir Chakra recipients. The crude oil tanker named MT Naik Jadunath Singh, PVC was delivered to SCI on 21 September 1984. The tanker was phased out after 25 years of service. A sports stadium in Shahjahanpur, the town near the village where Singh was born, was named as \\"Paramveer Chakra Lance Nayak Jadunath Singh Sports Stadium\\" in his honour.

It is home to the 86th Infantry Brigade Combat Team. The school is located in Vermont's Green Mountains. Purpose The school teaches a number of courses to train soldiers of the army (including Active Duty, the Army Reserve, Army National Guard, and ROTC cadets) in military operations in mountainous areas. Graduates of the Basic Military Mountaineer Course (BMMC) receive the special qualification identifier (SQI) of \\"E,\\" Military Mountaineer. The school runs 'summer' sessions focusing on rock climbing and high-angle tactical combat, and 'winter' courses that also include winter travel, camping, and survival skills. The basic and advanced courses of instruction trains individual soldiers, not units. These soldiers then return to their units to provide at least some training and experience in mountain warfare throughout the U.S. Army. Unit training, both at the AMWS and at the requesting unit's location, can also be provided. Overview The school was established in April 1983 to train members of the 3rd Battalion, 172nd Infantry Regiment (Mountain) then consisting of company-sized units from several New England states. Enrollment was opened over the years to include members of all branches of the armed services, Federal law enforcement and foreign armies. The curriculum design broadens the soldier's knowledge and unit’s capabilities. The curriculum is designed to enable the soldier to operate in mountains and cold and to enable him to assist in planning operations. The school uses a small group participatory learning process. The school conducts three primary courses of instruction (Basic Military Mountaineer, Advanced Military Mountaineer (Summer) and Advanced Military Mountaineer (Winter). Each level is to prepare soldiers to operate in mountains year-round and in cold, snowy, and/or icy environments. The Army Mountain Warfare School is the only institution that awards the Skill Qualification Identifier (SQI) \\"E,\\" Military Mountaineer (Note: This identifier is also awarded to graduates of the Northern Warfare Training Center's BMMC—conducted by U.S. Army Alaska in Black Rapids, Alaska—and the Special Forces Advanced Mountain Operations School—conducted by the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School in Estes Park, Colorado.). The school is the executive agent for military mountaineering for the United States Army Infantry School. The school is responsible for the content of Field Manual 3–97.61, Military Mountaineering. The school is the only non- European permanent member of the International Association of Military Mountain Schools (IAMMS). The curriculum is broken down into a two-week course, with three general type of mountain-specific skills taught in each: individual, small unit, and medical. The Basic Military Mountaineer Course is a prerequisite to attend the Advanced Military Mountaineer Course. The training focus is on providing the force structure with soldiers capable of assisting their units in mountainous environments. Courses for the Basic and Advanced Mountaineering Courses run monthly from May through October and January through March. It is very common for Army ROTC cadets to attend AMWS as a specialty school during ROTC. Cadets take the course during the summer as they are in school, and training during the school season. Other ROTC summer schools include: Airborne School, Air Assault School, Combat Diver Qualification Course, Drill Cadet Leadership Training, and Northern Warfare. This school is not to be confused with the Mountain phase of Ranger School. Courses Basic Military Mountaineer Course: Combined both the summer and winter courses of instruction into one combined course that will cover components of each phase depending on the time of year. The purpose of the BMMC is to train soldiers in the skills required to conduct mountain combat operations during any climatic conditions and to award the SQI \\"E\\" upon graduation. The following are general subject areas taught during this course of instruction: mountain navigation skills, individual mountain skills, small unit mountain skills, mountain medical skills, and summer specific practical exercises.Army Mountain Warfare School (AMWS), Basic Military Mountaineer Courses (BMMC), U.S. Army Fort Benning and The Maneuver Center of Excellence official website, last updated 25 May 2018, last accessed 17 March 2019 Advanced Military Mountaineer Course (Summer): The purpose of the Advanced Military Mountaineer Course (Summer) is to train soldiers in the knowledge/skills required to lead small units/teams over technically difficult, hazardous or exposed (class 4 and 5) mountainous terrain during summer months. Emphasis is placed on developing the level 2 assault climber tasks described in Chapter 2 of Army Field Manual 3-97.6, Mountain Operations (2000 Revision).Army Tactics Techniques Procedures (ATTP) 3-21.50, Infantry Small-Unit Mountain Operations, Department of the Army, dated February 2011, last accessed 18 March 2019 Advanced Military Mountaineer Course (Winter): The purpose of the Advanced Military Mountaineer Course (Winter) is to train soldiers in the skills required to lead small units over technically difficult, hazardous or exposed (class 4 and 5) mountainous terrain during cold weather climatic conditions. Rough Terrain Evacuation Course: The purpose of the Rough Terrain Evacuation Course is to train soldiers the skills to care for and safely evacuate an injured soldier over difficult terrain under austere conditions. The course combines classroom and field time with evacuation practical exercises. Many portions of the course are physically demanding as soldiers apply their newly learned skills in various medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) scenarios. Mountain Planners Course: The purpose of the Mountain Planners Course is to train mountain leaders the basic skills required to plan, support, and execute operations in mountainous terrain under various climatic conditions. Students are subjected to effects of altitude/cold/terrain on: personnel, equipment, movement, patrolling, reconnaissance, fire control, casualty evacuation (CASEVAC), offensive/defensive operations, required/available equipment and its use, resupply considerations, and water procurement. Practical exercises cover CASEVAC, patrolling, patrol base operations, rappelling, rope management, and route planning. Mountain Rifleman Course: The purpose of the Mountain Rifleman Course is to train snipers and squad designated marksman a combination of mountain specific skills and angle marksmanship fundamentals. The goal is improving mobility and lethality in mountainous terrain. Soldiers are provided with extensive shooting opportunities at both flat and angle ranges. Soldiers are taught basic mountain mobility and navigation skills. The skills are then combined in practical exercises that test a student's ability to plan and execute missions in mountainous terrain. The tasks taught are: mountain travel techniques, cold weather clothing, environmental injuries, soldier load management, characteristics of mountain terrain, basic mountaineering equipment, long range marksmanship in mountainous terrain, map reading in mountainous terrain, terrain exploitation, and land navigation.

It begins at the Middlesex Filter Beds Weir, below Lea Bridge, and is situated in the (modern) London Borough of Hackney. When built it contained two pound locks and a half-lock, but was rebuilt to handle larger barges in the 1850s, and now only Old Ford Lock, which is actually a duplicated pair, remains. History The River Lea (or Lee) has a long history of use for navigation, with records indicating that the Abbot of Waltham was authorised to make improvements in 1190, and evidence for tidal gates at Bow from the reign of King Edward I, when Henry de Bedyk, the prior at Halliwell Priory and owner of the nearby tide mills, erected a structure some time before 1307. River levels were managed by flash locks or sluices, and as the volumes of traffic using the river increased, there was friction between the bargees and the millers, since use of a flash lock affected the head of water available at the adjacent mill. In 1765, the commissioners responsible for the river asked the engineer John Smeaton to survey the river and make recommendations for its improvement. Smeaton produced his report in September 1766, in which he recommended that the flash locks should be replaced by pound locks with two sets of gates, and that a number of new cuts should be built, including what became known as the Hackney Cut from Lea Bridge to Old Ford. The commissioners advertised in the London Gazette and other newspapers that they wanted to borrow £35,000 to finance the improvements, to which there was a huge response. Some £161,500 was offered, and subscribers had to be picked by a ballot. Work on the whole scheme progressed quickly, and the contract for the Hackney Cut was awarded to Jeremiah Ilsley on 18 January 1768. He was probably acting as a public works contractor, since he also had contracts for the Waltham Cut and part of the Limehouse Cut, and so must have been managing a large labour force. He was to be paid 3 old pence (3d, 1.25p) per yard for the Hackney Cut, considerably less than the rate for the Limehouse Cut, which was 7d, and was given four months in which to complete the excavations. Contracts for the construction of the locks were separate to the excavation, and the work on the two locks of the Hackney Cut was given to Henry Holland, a bricklayer from Piccadilly, on 23 April 1768. Despite tight schedules, the work seems to have been completed on time, and the Hackney Cut opened for traffic on 7 August 1769. At the northern end of the cut, the river flowed to the east, through a weir now known as Middlesex Filter Beds Weir. Beside it was Hackney Waterworks Lock, the third pound lock to be built on the Navigation in 1762. It was tidal, as the course of the Old River Lee was affected by tides from the Thames up to this point. The new cut was protected by Lea Bridge Half Lock, a single set of gates just below the junction. Homerton Lock, which was also known as Hackney Brick Cistern Lock, was about one-third of the way along the cut, while Old Ford Lock was located just above where the cut rejoined the old course of the river. The lock was semi-tidal, as the level on this section of the river was maintained by Bow tidal gates, but spring tides often flowed over the top of the gates and the locks which supplemented them after 1850, continuing to do so until the installation of extra flood walls and higher flood gates in 2000. =Development= An Act of Parliament obtained in 1850 paved the way for a major upgrade of the navigation. Among other things, it removed the restriction on the maximum load that could be carried by barges. This had been set at 40 tons in 1805, but with the clause removed, the navigation between the Thames and Tottenham was gradually rebuilt to take 100-ton barges. Lea Bridge Lock remained in operation until 1853, when it was demolished. It was replaced by Pond Lane Lock, which was built in 1865 at Cow Bridge, about halfway between Lea Bridge and Homerton Lock. Seven years later, the navigation was rebuilt so that it was level from Tottenham to Old Ford, and the lock was then redundant, but was retained to help protect the navigation below it in times of flood. It was removed in 1931, when it was superseded by a new structure with vertical guillotine gates, located a little further upstream. These became redundant with the construction of the Thames Barrier, and the gates were removed in 1987.Pond Lane flood gates Retrieved 14 July 2008 Homerton lock was removed in the 1860s, following dredging of the river down to Old Ford. Old Ford Lock was rebuilt as a pair of locks on a different alignment in 1856, and the junction with the old course of the River Lee was reworked to remove an awkward bend. They were known as the small lock and the large lock, one being wide and the other being wide. Both were rebuilt with a width of in 1935, but retained their names, the small lock being shallower than the large lock. Further rebuilding had to take place during the Second World War after they were hit by a bomb on 19 October 1940, which also destroyed the lock houses. New lock houses were built in 1946, and were sold in the 1990s, after which they were used as the location for the television programme \\"The Big Breakfast\\". From 1829, water was abstracted at Lea Bridge, from the natural watercourse, by the East London Waterworks Company, to avoid the increasing pollution of the Navigation. The waterworks was located to the south of Old Ford Locks, and the company built a canal in 1830 which ran along the east bank of the Hackney Cut to transfer water from Lea Bridge for processing. William Hoof, who had gained a reputation as a specialist tunnelling contractor, after working on Strood Tunnel for the Thames and Medway Canal and Harecastle Tunnel on the Trent and Mersey Canal, worked on the waterworks project from 1829 until 1834. In 1824, George Duckett, the son of Sir George Duckett, 1st Baronet who had owned the Stort Navigation, obtained an Act of Parliament to link the Hackney Cut to the Regents Canal, which he hoped would result in much of the trade which passed onto the Thames from the Lee Navigation being re-routed to Regents Canal Dock. The Hertford Union Canal, which was long, included three locks, and joined the cut a short distance above Old Ford Locks, opened in 1830 but failed to attract much traffic, due to the level of tolls. Route The Hackney Cut is long from Lea Bridge road bridge to Old Ford Locks. Excess water from the Navigation passes over the weir into the former natural channel of the River Lea that passes in a large meander to the east of the modern water course, forming the boundary with the London Borough of Waltham Forest. The old course used to rejoin the Navigation below Old Ford Lock, but this route was modified by the construction of Carpenter's Road Lock on the Bow Back Rivers in 1930. Prescott Channel was built at the same time to provide a bypass around the tide mill at Three Mills, allowing the water to reach Bow Creek and the River Thames. A lock was built in the Prescott Channel in 2009.

A soldier trained in winter is also a good summer fighter; trained only in summer he is helpless in the winter!\\"Northern Warfare Training Center official site NWTC trains units and leaders in cold weather and mountain operations in order to increase warfighting capabilities. *Maintain instructor proficiency in cold weather and mountain operations. *Conduct collaborative development of Joint Forces cold weather and mountain doctrine. *Conduct mountain and cold regions search and rescue/recovery operations. NWTC History *Operations in cold and mountainous regions are not new to the U.S. Army. Ever since the Revolutionary War, when the ill- equipped and poorly trained Army of General Washington suffered in the cold at Valley Forge, some phase of almost every conflict in which the United States has been engaged in, has been fought in mountains or cold, or both. However, specialized training of units for cold weather and mountain warfare was not seriously undertaken until the approach of World War II. *Training for extended operations in cold and mountainous areas was initiated in November 1941 with the activation of the 87th Mountain Infantry and the Mountain and Winter Warfare Board at Fort Lewis, Washington. Training and testing were conducted by these organizations at Mount Rainier, Washington throughout the winter of 1941 - 1942. These units were later to become the nucleus for the first cold weather and mountain training center to be established by the U.S. Army. *While the 87th Mountain Infantry Regiment was undergoing training at Mount Rainier, plans were being made and a site was being selected for a division-sized center for cold weather and mountain warfare training. In 1942, the Mountain Training Center, with members of the 87th Mountain Infantry as a cadre, opened at Camp Hale. This was the first U.S. Army training center designed specifically for cold weather and mountain training. *Training of the 10th Mountain Division for its future role of fighting in the mountains of Italy was the prime accomplishment of the Mountain Training Center during World War II. However, this was not the only training conducted by the Center. In addition to training many smaller units at Camp Hale, training detachments were sent to such locations as Camp McCoy, Wisconsin; Pine Camp, New York; and Elkins, West Virginia and Adak Island, Alaska to assist in the training of units in the unique requirements of mountain and cold weather operations. *At the end of World War II, the mission of the Mountain Training Center at Camp Hale was moved to Camp Carson, Colorado. Camp Carson was the only U.S. Army Center for this type of training until 1948, when the decision was made to organize a school for arctic operations at Big Delta, Alaska later named Fort Greely. *In November 1948, the Army Arctic School was established at Big Delta with the primary mission of providing instruction in summer and winter operations under arctic and sub-arctic conditions. This training included arctic survival, mountaineering, skiing, and solutions to tactical, technical and logistical problems in cold regions. In July 1949, the Army Arctic School was redesignated the Army Arctic Indoctrination School, with no change in the mission. *For approximately eight years, training in mountain and cold weather operations were conducted simultaneously at Camp Carson, Colorado and Fort Greely, Alaska. However, in 1957, the total responsibility for cold weather and mountain training was transferred to Alaska. The Arctic Indoctrination School was redesignated the U.S. Army Cold Weather and Mountain School and was given the mission of developing cold weather and mountain warfare doctrine, tactics and techniques, and training individuals in these subjects *Throughout the years as the Arctic School, Arctic Indoctrination School, and Cold Weather and Mountain School, training was conducted on an individual basis. Students from reserve component and active Army units throughout the continental United States were graduated as instructors in cold weather and mountain operations. However, early in 1963, the Department of the Army concluded that the training in cold weather and mountain operations would be of more beneficial to units than individual training. Therefore, in April 1963, the U.S. Army Cold Weather and Mountain School was redesignated the U.S. Army Northern Warfare Training Center and given the mission of training individuals as well as units in the conduct of warfare in cold and mountainous regions. *Today, The Northern Warfare Training Center is responsible for maintaining the U.S. Army's state of the art in cold weather and mountain warfare. The Center provides training in these subjects to both active and reserve components and assists in the development of tactics and techniques for such operations.

Though the lineup has changed frequently, two of the founding members of the band, Jano Svoboda and Dušan Labuda have remained in the formation. The music of Kalijuge is quite difficult to classify. Working inside the bounds of the progressive metal music, Kalijuge takes motives and ideas that look similar to older bands like Kansas, Yes and Pink Floyd and adds from other styles like funk or even thrash sounds.  History = First Formation (1995) = The origin of the name of the band comes from Kali Yuga which is the fourth and last age of the Hindu mythology. It is supposed to mean \\"modern times\\" and we are in this age. = Old formation and new message (2002) = After a number of changes in the band, in 2002 it released its first EP called \\"New Message\\", recorded with the formation known as the \\"old formation\\" or \\"classical formation\\": Jano \\"Freedom\\" Svoboda, Dusan Labuda, Palo Chodelka, Lubos Tomascik, Jano Huljak. Truba, the former guitarist made the back vocals for the album. After performing all around Slovakia, the band gained a considerable national success, specially inside the musical rock underground where a formation like this was completely unknown in the country. The EP had three songs and became quite popular among the musicians related to the progressive or symphonic metal.Reference to the classical band in Encyclopaedia MetallumKalijuge! reference in Spirit of Metal During the next years, the band would continue giving concerts regularly with that classical formation. = Band break up and renewal (2004-2007) = Some of the musicians, for different reasons, left the band until the point that only 2 members from the original formation were remaining, Jano Svoboda and Dusan Labuda. Truba was already out of the band at the release of New Message. Palo Chodelka left the band too and continued working on his own solo project, Liquid Boogie Roll and some others projects. After that, the keyboard player Lubos Tomascik also left to start his personal project, which would be known later as the band Amphibios, and electronic-drum'n'bass band. A time after that Jano Huljak, the drummer would leave the band to finally join with the already formed band Amphibios. Some time after that differences between Svoboda and Labuda would end with the end of that era for Kalijuge!. Meanwhile, the singer of the band had been working with bands like Arzen and HT. Labuda started to play in another formation with Lukaš Rusnak and, after fixing his differences with Freedom, would restart in the band bringing Rusnak with him. After the rejoining of the band and the final farewell of Huljak, a new drummer, Martin Kralik, joined them. From Martin contacts they found a very skilled keyboardist, classical music piano player, Barbora Lipkova. She had finished in the top positions in some European contests of piano performance and would record some new themes with them that would never be totally finished. Very skilled technically and musically, the new keyboardist did not put the band among her top priorities which included some other formations. The band couldn't perform any concerts during 2007 because Lipkova was not in the country at that time, due to working reasons. = Last renewal and return (2008) = Around the first days of March 2008, Svoboda started talking with a new keyboard player after realizing that Lipkova would not have time enough to play with them. This new keyboard player was Rafael Márquez, a Spaniard who had been living in Slovakia for more than 2 years and had played in other formations. Marquez accepted to try playing with them and after this encounter started to work with the band about the end of April 2008. In the month of June 2008, after 2 months of training together with the full new formation, Kalijuge! returned to the scene with a concert in Žilina, the band's hometown.Critic in Headbang slovak website(in slovak) The band continued working during the summer on 2008 on the release of the album and some concerts.

Although the men's basketball rivalry had died down after the 1990s, it has been back in limelight in 2013 as both schools again met in the UAAP basketball championship series. The rivalry had also been apparent in women's volleyball where the two teams are frequent finalists in the UAAP Volleyball Championship and the Shakey's V-League. Prior to La Salle joining the UAAP the two schools met in the championship of the 1948–49 season of the National Seniors Open, a yearly tournament of top collegiate and commercial teams in the country. La Salle defeated UST in overtime to win the title. The rivalry returned on consecutive UAAP Finals series in men's basketball. La Salle was defeated three consecutive years in the Finals from 1994 through 1996 capping UST's 4 year title run. UST was finally dethroned by La Salle during the 1997 semifinals. In 1998 La Salle again eliminated UST in the semifinals to begin their own four-year championship run. La Salle bounced back defeating UST in overtime for the 1999 UAAP basketball title. The Game 1 finals victory was their last against La Salle until 2007 when UST won in overtime during regular season; La Salle went on to win the 2007 UAAP title. At this point, UST's basketball program regressed, but they won in 2006 when La Salle was suspended after admitting they had unknowingly fielded two ineligible players. La Salle would then win all games until 2011. La Salle again defeated UST in overtime during the UAAP Season 76 basketball championship in 2013. The rivalry carried over to women's volleyball in the UAAP and Shakey's V-League, where UST and La Salle met thrice in the Finals, with UST winning the first and La Salle winning the latter two. The Lady Spikers and the Tigresses met three times in the championship of the Shakey's V-League tournament with UST winning the first and La Salle winning the latter two. The Tigresses have won 5 championships while the Lady Spikers have 3 under their belt. In the UAAP, the DLSU Lady Spikers and the UST Tigresses met in the Finals for two consecutive seasons – Season 72 (won by UST) and Season 73 (won by La Salle), although UST has seen fluctuation in season-long performances in women's volleyball amidst the rise of contemporary contenders such as Ateneo, FEU and National University. Both schools, however, met in the semifinals in Season 79 (won by La Salle) and Season 81 (won by UST), the latter of which ended La Salle's decade-long streak of finals appearances by 2019 (running from 2009 to 2018), the most in the Final Four era of the UAAP.  Men's basketball  Both teams are guaranteed to face each other at the elimination round (regular season) twice, while they can meet for a maximum of three times in the playoffs. The games were played consistently from 1986 until 2006 when La Salle was suspended for fielding two ineligible players.

While some writers make a distinction between a qabalah and a gematria, in current usage the term qabalah may refer to either type of system. Most of the systems developed since the death of Aleister Crowley (1875-1947) have been created with the intent of gaining a better understanding of the mysteries elaborated in his inspired works, especially those in Liber AL vel Legis, the Book of the Law. Qabalah vs. gematria According to Jake Stratton-Kent, a qabalah is specifically related to three factors: a language, a holy text or texts, and mathematical laws at work in these two. Emery More speculates that the Latin alphabet together with the Arabic numerals are the standardized scripting of the Aeon of Horus, potentially revealing new truths and natural orders hitherto unknown, and that they should therefore effectively replace the keys of past systems. Gematria, on the other hand, is a system in which letters are equated to number values. The letters comprising the word or name of person or object are then summed together. The number of this sum is termed the key of that particular word. Words sharing the same key are said to share properties. The letters are often tabulated along with their numerical equivalents. An example of the simplest serial gematria for English letters would be the following: A=1 B=2 C=3 D=4 E=5 F=6 G=7 H=8 I=9 J=10 K=11 L=12 M=13 N=14 O=15 P=16 Q=17 R=18 S=19 T=20 U=21 V=22 W=23 X=24 Y=25 Z=26 Systems of English qabalah=Willis F. Whitehead= The first reference to an English Qabalah found in the literature was made by Willis F. Whitehead in 1899 in his book, The Mystic Thesaurus, in which he describes a system he called \\"English Cabala.\\" Original from Harvard University collection digitized November 17, 2005, online at =Aleister Crowley= In 1904, Aleister Crowley wrote out the text of the foundational document of his world-view, known as Liber AL vel Legis, The Book of the Law. In this text was the injunction found at verse 2:55; \\"Thou shalt obtain the order & value of the English Alphabet, thou shalt find new symbols to attribute them unto\\" which was understood by Crowley as referring to an English Qabalah yet to be developed or revealed. In one of the Holy Books of Thelema written by Aleister Crowley in 1907, called Liber Trigrammaton, sub figura XXVII -- Being the Book of the Mutations of the Tao with the Yin and the Yang, are 27 three-line diagrams known as 'trigrams', which are composed of a solid line for the Yang, a broken line for the Yin, and a point for the Tao. By attributing 26 Roman script letters to the trigrams of this work, Crowley felt that he had fulfilled the injunction to \\"obtain the order & value of the English Alphabet\\", as noted in his 'Old Comment' to The Book of the Law. Crowley did not go on to develop a full qabalah from this work. =James Lees' English Qaballa (EQ)= The first report of the system known as English Qaballa (EQ) was published in 1979 by Ray Sherwin in an editorial in the final issue of his journal, The New Equinox. In his editorial, Sherwin reported that the \\"order & value of the English Alphabet\\" Chapter III, Verse 47. had been discovered by an English magician, James Lees, in November 1976. Lees subsequently assumed the role of publisher of The New Equinox and, starting in 1981, published additional material about the EQ system over the course of five issues of the journal, extending into 1982. The first software designed to perform textual analysis of Liber AL and the other Holy Books of Thelema was written in 1984-5 by Trevor Langford. Langford subsequently worked with Jake Stratton-Kent on The Equinox: British Journal of Thelema, in which further original material on EQ was summarized by Stratton-Kent in the March 1988 issue. The \\"order & value\\" of the letters in EQ was derived from the grid superimposed on the page of manuscript of Liber AL on which this verse (Ch. III, v. 47) appears (sheet 16 of Chapter III). Also appearing on this page are a diagonal line and a circled cross. The Book of the Law states that the book should only be printed with Crowley's hand-written version included, suggesting that there are mysteries in the \\"chance shape of the letters and their position to one another\\" of Crowley's handwriting. Whichever top-left to bottom-right diagonal is read the magickal order of the letters is obtained. As there are ten squares per column, this method is equivalent to taking every eleventh letter of the alphabet as the order and then assigning them sequential values: A=1 L=2 W=3 H=4 S=5 D=6 O=7 Z=8 K=9 V=10 G=11 R=12 C=13 N=14 Y=15 J=16 U=17 F=18 Q=19 B=20 M=21 X=22 I=23 T=24 E=25 P=26 In the original handwritten text, the string of letters and numbers in the 76th verse of the second chapter is divided into two lines, the first ending with \\"Y\\" and the second beginning with \\"X\\". Stratton-Kent thought that in the manuscript the 'X' at the beginning of line two looked like a multiplication symbol, so he added each line's values together and multiplied them; 17x11=187, the numerical value of the phrase \\"English alphabet\\", which he felt confirmed the correctness of the system. Little, if any, further material on English Qaballa was published until the appearance of Jake Stratton-Kent's book, The Serpent Tongue: Liber 187, in 2011. This was followed in 2016 by The Magickal Language of the Book of the Law: An English Qaballa Primer by Cath Thompson, who had inherited the original writings of James Lees and the order, of which she was a member, that had originated the EQ. An account of the discovery, exploration, and continuing research and development of the system up to 2010, by James Lees and members of his group in England, is detailed in her 2018 book, All This and a Book. ALW cipher / New Aeon English Qabalah (NAEQ) Well subsequent to the original discovery and publication of the English Qaballa (EQ), several self-published authors appropriated and rebranded the system. In 1994, Allen H. Greenfield referred to the system as the \\"ALW cipher\\" in his self-published book, Secret Cipher of the UFOnauts (Illuminet Press, 1994; Lulu.com, 2006). In 2003, Gerald Del Campo also presented the same system, referring to it as a \\"New Aeon English Qabalah\\" or \\"NAEQ\\" in his book, New Aeon English Qabalah Revealed. In 2004, John L. Crow also referred to the system using the same nomenclature in a book published under the same imprint, The New Aeon English Qabalah Dictionary. =Linda Falorio's Liber CXV: The English Qabalah= Kenneth Grant, in his 1992 book Hecate's Fountain, discusses Linda Falorio's at the time unpublished work, Liber CXV: The English Qabalah, stating that it was written in Pittsburgh in 1979. Falorio has since published Liber CXV on her website, EnglishQabalah.com. Her site appears to claim unregistered trademarks on \\"The English Qabalah\\", \\"EQ\\", and \\"E.Q.\\" =William Eisen's The English Cabalah= A system related to the Spiritualist Agasha Temple of Wisdom was described by William Eisen in his two volume The English Cabalah (1980–82). =William Gray's Concepts of Qabalah= William G. Gray proposes another system in his 1984 book, Concepts of Qabalah, more recently republished as Qabalistic Concepts. This system includes correspondence attributions of the English letters to the positions on the Tree of Life. =R. Leo Gillis' Trigrammaton Qabalah (TQ)= Another system of English Qabalah was proposed by R. Leo Gillis around 1988, published on his website, Trigrammaton.com, starting in 1998, and subsequently released as an eBook. Known as Trigrammaton Qabalah, or TQ, this system is based on one of the Holy Books of Thelema written by Aleister Crowley in 1907, called Liber Trigrammaton, sub figura XXVII -- Being the Book of the Mutations of the Tao with the Yin and the Yang. Liber Trigrammaton (aka Liber XXVII) was called by Crowley \\"the ultimate foundation of the highest theoretical qabalah\\". In Liber XXVII are 27 three- line diagrams known as 'trigrams', which are composed of a solid line representing yang, a broken line representing the yin, and a point representing Tao. Crowley later attributed the 26 letters of the English alphabet to these trigrams, in an attempt to fulfill an injunction found in his earlier work Liber AL vel Legis, The Book of the Law, verse 2:55 which states: \\"Thou shalt obtain the order & value of the English Alphabet, thou shalt find new symbols to attribute them unto.\\" By attributing the English alphabet to the trigrams in his later work, Crowley considered this verse to be fulfilled, as noted in his 'Old Comment' to The Book of the Law. TQ is an extension of Crowley's work with Liber Trigrammaton. By considering the numerical value of the 27 trigrams as expressions in ternary (base 3), and then transferring those values to the letters attributed by Crowley to the trigrams, a system of English gematria is created. Further use is made of the trigrams to create a true qabalah in the sense of the definition provided by Jake Stratton-Kent above. Correspondences are created with some of the major forms of divination such as the I Ching, Tarot and runes, as well as Greek and Hebrew alphabets, the Tree of Life, Western and Vedic astrology, magic squares, and the Platonic solids. A primary feature of this qabalah is a new understanding of the Cube of Space and its 26 components of edges, faces, and vertices, which equal the number of letters in the English alphabet. Trigrammaton Qabalah gematria values are as follows: A=5 B=20 C=2 D=23 E=13 F=12 G=11 H=3 I=0 J=7 K=17 L=1 M=21 N=24 O=10 P=4 Q=16 R=14 S=15 T=9 U=25 V=22 W=8 X=6 Y=18 Z=19 =E. Joel Love's Cipher X= In 1994, E. Joel Love, a student of the ALW cipher (who was both a colleague of Greenfield and Coutu), and a member of the Hermetic Alchemical Order of the QBLH, proposed another English cipher that he would call 'Cipher X'. Love possessed a high mathematical aptitude and formal training in Cryptography in the U.S Coast Guard. A lifelong Thelemite, Love considered the ALW cipher to be incomplete to the task of answering many of the cosmological and deep structure questions proposed by Gillis' system. Both Gillis and Stratton-Kent met with Joel Love in 2004 and were mutually surprised to find that both Love's and Gillis' work contained many striking parallels. Love considered the ALW cipher to be representative of an authentic epistle, and interpreted verses in Liber XXVII to hint at a process of inversion. By taking the obvious base three trigrams system of Liber XXVII, and by comparing them to the cipher key of ALW, these inversions resulted in 'Cipher X' which, technically speaking, is the base three inversion of the ALW Cipher. Love always maintained that Cipher X was a complement to ALW, and himself being an advanced user of LEXICON, was a vocal proponent of comparing the results of many ciphers, a study he called 'cross cipher correlation'. Love would go on to compile over 20 years of notes and research. Love had several students, the first of which was longtime friend and colleague H. Thomas Chaudoin. Chaudoin maintains that he was present during the years that the bulk of this research was 'transmitted' to Love. Chaudoin would go on to found the NOT (New Order of Thelema), using many of Love's innovations as a foundation. Love was also a colleague and acquaintance of the late Robert Anton Wilson and a close friend of the late Kerry Wendell Thornley, co-founder of Discordianism. Love passed in June 2015. Base 3 inversion of the ALW cipher values results in the following values: A=9 L=18 W=3 H=12 S=21 D=6 O=15 Z=24 K=1 V=10 G=19 R=4 C=13 N=22 Y=7 J=16 U=25 F=2 Q=11 B=20 M=5 X=14 I=23 T=8 E=17 P=26 =Frater Perseverando's Liber A vel Follis= On January 23, 1995, Frater Perseverando (Shane Clayton) wrote Liber A vel Follis: The Book of the Holy Fool, which he describes as having been from Auset. He called the system described in this short document as \\"cipher 1=A=0\\" and noted that in this system, the phrase \\"the English Cabala\\" sums to 111. He also assigned the letters of the English alphabet to the Tarot major and minor arcanas, elements, planets, and signs. =David Cherubim's English Qabalah: The Key of it All= In 1996, David Cherubim published English Qabalah: The Key of it All under the auspices of The Order of the Thelemic Golden Dawn. =The English Qabalah of AREXZ 1496= While the date of origin of this system is unknown, it was first made public circa 2001 on the website of Ecclesia Gnostica Universalis (EGnU.org). The keynote of this system is \\"The order of the English alphabet is the order of the English alphabet,\\" and it uses a ranked gematria similar to the numeration of the Hebrew and Greek alphabets. Systems of English gematria The first appearance of a system of gematria using the natural order of the English alphabet was developed in 1532 by Michael Stifel, who also proposed a system called the trigonal alphabet, using successive triangular numbers.Dudley, Underwood. Numerology, Or, What Pythagoras Wrought. Cambridge University Press, 1997. Another early system of English gematria was used by poet John Skelton.Walker, Julia. M. Medusa's Mirrors: Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, and the metamorphosis of the female self, pp. 33-42 University of Delaware Press, 1998. An analogue of the Greek system of isopsephy using the Latin alphabet appeared in 1583. Other variations appeared in 1683 (simply referred to as the 1683 alphabet, this system was used by Leo Tolstoy in War and Peace to identify Napoleon with the number of the Beast) and 1707 (Alphabetum Cabbalisticum Vulgare). These and other variations are detailed in Underwood Dudley's Numerology, Or, What Pythagoras Wrought. In 1952, John P.L. Hughes published The Hidden Numerical Significance of the English Language, or, Suggestive Gematria, based on his lecture delivered at Holden Research Circle on July 4, 1952. For further information on this edition and subsequent reprints, see More recently, Michael Bertiaux described a system called Angelic Gematria in his The Voudon Gnostic Workbook (1989),Bertiaux, Michael.

Located in the Korazim Plateau, around three kilometres northeast of Rosh Pinna, it falls under the jurisdiction of Upper Galilee Regional Council. In it had a population of . History The land on which Mahanayim stands was purchased in 1892 by the Ahavat Zion (Love of Zion) Hovevei Zion organization, with the aim of establishing a moshava in the area. In 1898 a number of families from Galicia settled in the area, naming it Mahanayim after the biblical city in Gilead, where Jacob stayed before he met again with his brother Esau and saw angels, therefore calling it Mahanayim (camps) of God (Genesis 32:2). However, it was not a success, largely due to the settlers' lack of familiarity with the region, a shortage of money, and a lack of professionalism, resulting in the community disintegrating. The Jewish Colonization Association ran a trial of growing tobacco in the area, but it too was a failure, and the village was abandoned in 1912. In 1916 a kvutza of Poale Zion members arrived in the area, establishing the first working settlement in the Upper Galilee. According to the 1922 census of Palestine by the British Mandate authorities, Mahanayim had a population of 30 Jews. In the same year it became a moshav, but was abandoned in 1928. The village was established for a third time in 1939 by members of kibbutz \\"Yodfat\\" from Safed. Starting in 1979, the community's metalworks was used by Meir Dagan (later head of the Mossad) as a site to secretly assemble bombs to be used by proxies in the civil war in nearby Lebanon.

Five were consuls and one was dictator. Gaius Julius Iulus (consul 489 BC) Gaius Julius L. f. Iulus, consul in 489 BC with Publius Pinarius Mamercinus Rufus. During their year of office the Volscians under Coriolanus commenced war against Rome.Dionysius of Halicarnassus 8.1 Livy omits the consuls of this year altogether. Gaius Julius Iulus (consul 482 BC) Gaius Julius C. f. L. n. Iulus, the son of Gaius, who had been consul in 489 BC, was himself consul in 482 BC. His colleague was Quintus Fabius Vibulanus, who had previously been consul in 485. Iulus was elected to the office in consequence of an agreement between the two parties in the state, who, after the most violent opposition in the consular comitia, had at length consented that Iulus should be chosen as the popular and Fabius as the aristocratic candidate. Such is the account of Dionysius, but Livy merely says that the discord in the state was as violent this year as previously. The consuls marched against the Veientes, but as the enemy did not appear in the field, they returned to Rome, after laying waste the Veientine territory.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, 8.90, 91; Livy, 2.43 In 451 BC, Iulus was a member of the first decemvirate, and it is recorded as an instance of the moderation of the first college of decemvirs, that, though there was no appeal from their sentence, Iulus brought before the comitia centuriata an accusation against Publius Sestius, a man of patrician rank, in whose house the corpse of a murdered man had been found, when he might have himself passed sentence upon the criminal.Livy, 3.33; Cicero, de Rep. ii. 36; Dionysius of Halicarnassus, 10.56; Diodorus Siculus, 12.23) Iulus is again mentioned in 449 BC, as one of three men of consular rank, who were sent by senate as emissaries to the plebeians, when the latter had risen against the second college of decemvirs, and were encamped upon the Aventine Hill.Livy, 3.50; Ascon. in Cic. Cornel. p. 77, ed. Baiter.) Gaius Julius Iulus (consul 447 BC) Gaius Julius C. f. C. n. Iulus, son of the consul of 482 BC, was consul in 447, with Marcus Geganius Macerinus, and again in 435 BC, with Lucius Verginius Tricostus. In the latter year Rome was visited with such grievous pestilence, that not only were the Romans unable to march out of their own territory to devastate the enemy's, but they offered no opposition to the Fidenates and Veientes, who advanced almost up to the Colline gate. While Iulus manned the walls, his colleague consulted the senate and eventually named a dictator.Livy, 3.65, 4.21; Diodorus Siculus 12.29,49. According to Licinius Macer, Iulus was elected consul for the third time in the following year, with his colleague of the preceding. Other accounts mentioned other persons serving as consuls, and still others record consular tribunes this year.Livy, 4.23 Gaius Julius Iulus (consular tribune 408 BC) Gaius Julius L. f. Vop. n. Iulus, grandson of the consul of 482 BC, was one of three consular tribunes in 408, and held the same office again in 405 BC, this time with five colleagues. In the former year, Iulus and his colleague Publius Cornelius Cossus vehemently opposed the nomination of a dictator; and in the latter year Iulus and his colleagues took part in the commencement of the siege of Veii.Livy, 4.56, 61; Diodorus Siculus, 13.104; 14.17. Iulus was censor in 393 BC, but died during his year of office.Livy, 5.31, 9.34; Plutarch, \\"The Life of Camillus\\", 14. Gaius Julius Iulus (dictator 352 BC) Gaius Julius Iulus was nominated dictator in 352 BC, under pretense of an apprehended war with the Etruscans, but in reality to carry the election of two patricians in the consular comitia, in violation of the Licinian law.Livy, 7.21.

Founded in 1624 by order of the Spanish King Philip IV, and with the support of Pope Innocent XII, the university was intended to provide an education in Law and Theology to the families and descendants of the wealthy gentry of South America. At the turn of the 19th century, Chuquisaca and its university came to constitute a center of revolutionary zeal in Bolivia. The university intellectually sustained the well-cultivated Francophile elite whose ideals led to the Bolivian War of Independence and ultimately to the independence of all the Spanish colonies.

The paradoxical nature of a municipal area officially being a subset of one district despite being larger in area than the district itself is mostly attributed to government reluctance to streamline the administration, and the fact that Kolkata's gradual urban sprawl is not only a result of economic development and demographic growth due to incoming migrants from other states. It is also a product of millions of Hindu refugees settling in fits and starts across the city, during multiple bouts of violence in the region, and especially in 1947 and 1971. Listed in ascending order of area, the broad administrative definitions of the city are : =Kolkata District= Headed by the District Collector for Kolkata district, it primarily includes the historic core and downtown parts of the city. It functions as an administrative unit for revenue, national and central policymaking and census enumeration purposes. =Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC)= Kolkata Municipal Corporation ward level map as of 2011 Census. Three additional wards have been added since then, taking the total to 144. The relatively larger area of the city's main administrative body, the KMC, is the one most widely understood to be what constitutes (\\"Kolkata or Kolkata City\\"). Its 144 municipal wards span the entirety of the city's core area under the Kolkata District, as well as areas under the administration of South 24 Parganas district such as (Behala, Kudghat, Jadavpur, Garia), among others. The KMC oversees and manages the civic infrastructure of the city's 15 boroughs, which together encompass 144 wards. Each ward elects a councillor to the KMC. Each borough has a committee of councillors, each of whom is elected to represent a ward. By means of the borough committees, the corporation undertakes urban planning and maintains roads, government-aided schools, hospitals, and municipal markets. As Kolkata's apex body, the corporation discharges its functions through the mayor-in-council, which comprises a mayor, a deputy mayor, and ten other elected members of the KMC. The functions of the KMC include water supply, drainage and sewerage, sanitation, solid waste management, street lighting, and building regulation. Kolkata Municipal Corporation =Kolkata Police= Kolkata Police jurisdiction map showing 79 police stations Since 2 September 2011, the area under the jurisdiction of Kolkata Police has remained co-terminus with the KMC area. =Greater Kolkata= A non-legal term with no fixed boundaries, it is used colloquially by citizens and enjoys wide recognition in conversations, advertisements and addresses, being firmly embedded in the city's social fabric. Historically, it has always broadly composed of the KMC area and other urban localities situated just adjacent to it. To the north, some of these localities are, from west to east: Panihati, Kamarhati, Baranagar, Madhyamgram], Dum Dum, North Dum Dum, South Dum Dum, Baguiati,Saltlake and Rajarhat. To the south, these are from west to east: Budge Budge, Maheshtala and Sonarpur. Many of these have municipality status. =Kolkata Metropolitan Area= Kolkata, Howrah Municipal Corporations along with all other municipalities that make up the Kolkata metropolitan area, the third-largest urban agglomeration in India According to the 2011 Census of India, the much larger Kolkata Metropolitan Area is the third-largest urban agglomeration in India. It is spread across the districts of North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas, Nadia, Hooghly and Howrah, with nearly 2 crore residents. The Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA), another ancillary civic body, is responsible for the statutory planning and development of this mega urban area. The KMA includes a large suburban hinterland around the urban centres of Kolkata. The city also has an apolitical titular post, that of the Sheriff of Kolkata. The Sheriff presides over various city-related functions and conferences. State government Historical State Secretariat Writers' Building Calcutta High Court As the capital of the state and the seat of the Government of West Bengal, Kolkata houses not only the various offices of local government listed above, but also, for the state level, the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, the Secretariat (Writers' Building) and the Calcutta High Court. Kolkata also has lower courts; the Small Causes Court for civil matters, and the Sessions Court for criminal cases. Assembly and parliamentary constituencies West Bengal Legislative Assembly Bidhan Sabha The parliamentary constituencies and assembly constituencies in West Bengal, as defined by Election Commission of India, underwent delimitation in 2008 according to the report of the Delimitation Commission. Kolkata district is divided into 16 assembly constituencies (and partially 1 more also) — Kashipur-Belgachhia, Maniktala, Shyampukur, Jorasanko, Beleghata, Entally, Chowringhee, Kolkata Port, Metiaburuz (partially), Bhabanipur, Ballygunge, Rashbehari, Kasba, Behala Purba, Behala Paschim, Tollyganj and Jadavpur. There are two parliamentary constituencies — Kolkata North and Kolkata South — that have the name \\"Kolkata\\" associated with them. Chowringhee, Entally, Beliaghata, Jorasanko, Shyampukur, Maniktala and Kashipur-Belgachhia assembly constituencies form Kolkata Uttar (Lok Sabha constituency). Kolkata Port, Bhabanipur, Ballygunge, Rashbehari, Kasba, Behala Purba and Behala Paschim assembly constituencies form Kolkata Dakshin (Lok Sabha constituency). Jadavpur and Tollyganj assembly constituencies are within Jadavpur parliamentary constituency. Few wards (Ward no 136 to 141) of Kolkata Municipal Corporation (Kolkata district) area constitute part of Metiaburuz (Vidhan Sabha constituency). Metiaburuz assembly constituency also has wards from Maheshtala Municipality of South 24 Parganas District. Metiaburuz assembly constituency lies within Diamond Harbour parliamentary constituency.

It covers eight of the 34 cantos in Dante Alighieri's Inferno, part of his 14th century epic poem Divine Comedy. Peter Greenaway and Tom Phillips won the Prix Italia for A TV Dante, their ambitious project to produce a video version of Dante's Inferno. Greenaway was first inspired by artist Tom Phillips’ illustrated translation of the work and they collaborated on this, the first eight Cantos of the work, using all the state-of-the-art technological resources available to the electronic media at the time. The eight Cantos of the film are not conventionally dramatised, rather they are illuminated with layered and juxtaposed imagery and a soundtrack which comments, counterpoints and clarifies. There are visual footnotes delivered by relevant expert authorities, and these often perform the function of narration as well as illustration. The result is a video journey through Dante's underworld. A TV Dante was continued in 1991 through a further six of the Cantos, 9 through 14, by Chilean director Raoul Ruiz.

It is a typical Kerala rural settlement with the nature's green covering, ringing rivulets, small hills and slopes, agricultural fields, inhabited by rustic population. It is a Kara in Vellavoor revenue village in Changanacherry taluk, Kottayam district. Transportation The nearest railway stations are Kottayam (32 km) and Changanacherry (28 km), and the nearest Airport is Cochin Airport (Nedumbassery) about 81 km away. Etymology The name Kadayanickadu is composed of three syllables, namely 'Kada,' 'Ani' and 'Kadu.' 'Kada' means the end or the last portion. 'Ani' means Mother Goddess Devi. 'Kadu' is jungle as also abode of Devi. Thus 'Anikadu' means a 'Kadu (or Kavu)' where Devi is installed. There is an ancient Devi temple here. The place Kadayanickadu lies in the middle-end of two Anikadus in the neighborhood - Anikadu north and Anicadu south with very famous Devi temples. 'Kada,' the middle-end of both the Anikadus became ‘Kadayanikadu,’ the abode of Mother Goddess. The whole Anikadu area would have been once a single unit. It is also possible that the name is derived from ‘Ayini’ tree (also known as 'Anjili' - Artocarpus hirsutus), which was abundantly found and widely used in the construction of ancient houses in this area. Another possibility is that the name coined from the word 'Katyayani,' (also Kathyayini), another name for goddess Durga in Sanskrit. Two ancient Devi temples of Kadayanickadu reinforce this conjecture. = History and Culture = There is no legendary evidence even to know when human habitation commenced here. It has got a hoary past. There are certain house/locality names like Vizhapadikal, Paruvackadu, Karimpanil, Kallikal, Murudenpalakal, the correct import of the words is not deducible in current Malayalam. These words would have been used in very old days. This throws light on the fact that human habitation started here hundreds of years back. Roof tiles of Thayyil Tharavadu manufactured by P. Albuquerque & Sons Mangalore in the year 1868 Another set of roof tiles of Thayyil Tharavadu manufactured by J. H. Morgan & Sons Mangalore Thekkukoor Kingdom According to known history, it was once part of Thekkumkoor kingdom, and was under the control of two Local Lords (Madampies), namely Ranni Kartha and Agasthanathu Nair, responsible for the maintenance of law and order as also tax collection. In AD 1749 King Marthanda Varma captured Thekkumkoor and annexed it to Venad. All the previous Local Lords were removed from the posts and the king brought his own loyal people for the administration. The entire land from the precincts of Nedumkunnam to Chirakkadavu, extending for about 20 km was put under the progeny of a woman who was brought in marriage from Chelampaneth family of Ayroor to Madhavakottu family in Kangazha. This family was later divided into three branches or Tharavadus. Kangazha area came under the control of Eranattu or Erattu and Kadayanickadu under Thayyil Tharavadu. Thayyil Tharavadu It is believed that a prominent Karnavar of that time, Thayyil Samprathipillai, who was also the palace head clerk, rebuilt the Thayyil Tharavadu buildings about 250 years ago. It is a wooden building structure measuring 40 X 25 feet covered with fireproof brick and lime mortar on the top. There is a vast underground cell (Nilavara) and inner cells constructed in such away as to store paddy produced in the vast stretch of land owned by the family at that time. Closely placed wooden ceiling beams of its roof and the tiles of M/s. P. Albuquerque & Sons, Mangalore manufactured in the year 1868 are evidencing the fact that the house was formerly thatched, but has later been tiled. Nair families The north eastern a part of Kadayanikadu is owned and inhabited by other Nair families from very old times. They are Kannankavunkal, Kulathinkal, Mukkanolil, Vellachira and Pulinthara. Their ancestors were agriculturists who did the cultivation themselves. They had their own temple, and Sarpa Kavu which exists even today.  Ezhava Caste  Another prominent sect is Ezhavas. They live in the north western corner areas. The legendary belief is that they are the progeny of a Namboothiri woman from elsewhere who married an Ezhava and settled here. The previously mentioned famous Devi temple is owned by them. It is believed that the idol installed there was the one used by the Namboothiri women for her personal worship. The Ezhavas of Kadayanickadu are of higher standards, rather Orthodox and are landowners. The main families are Vakananil, Konattu, Koyippuram and Puthanpurackal. The other backward classes and castes like Ulaya, Pulayars, Paravans etc. are also living here as sons of the soil for centuries. Their ancestors would have been agricultural labors. Christian Community A few Christian families also live here from very old times. The earliest appears to be Ambalattumkal. In those days there was a belief that once a certain Hindu community (oil mongers) makes coconut oil, one Christian person has to touch that oil for purification. It is believed that Ambalattumkal family was brought and settled here for the purpose of \\"oil purification by touch.\\" The other Christian families are Sarpathummuri, Mathilakam, Poothiot & Thottiyil. Malayil family came from Vazhoor and settled here. Several Christians from Kozhencherry came and settled in Thottathumkuzhyil area. These families are still known as Kozhencherry family. Abraham Mathai, Thondutharayil was the first one to settle down in Kadayanickadu from Kozhencherry. Most of the Christians are engaged in commercial and farming activities. Hindus, Christians and Muslims lived cordially and peacefully in Kadayanickadu for several years. Community Life In Kadayanikadu complete interaction mutual respects, co operation exists between all the castes, creed & faiths. There are major temples, two for Devi and for Sastha.

The character first appears in Hack/Slash: Euthanized (April 2004), and was created by writer and occasional penciller Tim Seeley. Seeley has repeatedly stated that Cassie is designed to be a horror victim who has overcome her fears and decided to take revenge on horror villains, who are known in the comic as \\"slashers\\". However, despite her hardened exterior, Seeley has tried to show that \\"beneath [the surface Cassie] is still [a] lost, scared innocent girl\\".Tim Seeley Hacks and Slashes His Way Through Comicdom , Silver Bullet Comics, November 7, 2006 In 2005, Stefani Bishop portrayed Cassie in a stage adaptation of Hack/Slash called Hack/Slash: Stagefright.Hack/Slash: Stage Fright Chicago Style Grand Guignol, Comic Book Resources, October 23, 2005 A film adaptation of Hack/Slash was in development by Rogue Pictures.HACK/SLASH collection and movie news , Fangoria, December 18, 2007 Publication history Cassie and her partner, Vlad, first appeared in the Hack/Slash one- shot (later renamed Hack/Slash: Euthanized) in 2004. This included a brief backstory called The Strange Story of Cassie Hack. Between 2005 and 2007 a series of further one-shots were released including a mini-series: Hack/Slash: Land of Lost Toys. In 2007, Hack/Slash became an ongoing series. Hack/Slash has included crossovers with other franchises with Cassie and Vlad encountering Evil Ernie, Chucky, a horde of treehuggers and Herbert West from the cult-classic Re-Animator film series. Fictional character biography=Early life= Cassandra \\"Cassie\\" Hack, daughter of Dr. Jack and Delilah Hack, grew up in western Wisconsin. Her father left soon after she was born, leaving Cassie with her overbearing, eccentric mother who worked as a cook at a nearby high school. A timid wallflower, plain-looking and unattractive, young Cassie was verbally and physically abused by her classmates. Never having a friend, Cassie was ostracized because she wasn't pretty and was poor and ill-dressed. This prompted her unbalanced mother, the \\"Lunch Lady\\", to kill every child at Cassie's school that had somehow hurt or insulted Cassie and serve them as the school food. Cassie, witnessing her mother's last killing spree, promptly called the police. She managed to save the life of her mother's last victim, but was forced to witness her mother's death when she committed suicide. Cassie was placed in a foster home and attended a new school. She detested her fanatically religious foster parents, but endured, desiring to be accepted by someone. She began training in various martial arts and fighting techniques. In the meantime, she tried to find her father, utilizing the internet and whatever resources she could find. Two years later, children began disappearing once more, signalling the return of her mother, reborn as a vengeful \\"slasher\\" trying to continue its murderous spree. Feeling responsible for the deaths, Cassie confronted her mother once again and shot her. Driven by guilt and lacking any connection to anyone or anyplace, Cassie left her foster family and went on the road. =Solo adventures= Cassie became determined to seek out slashers and stop their rampages wherever she could. She also hoped that she might find a clue to the whereabouts of her father, but for a long time, found nothing. On one of her adventures, Cassie came to Chicago, where she hunted a killer known as \\"the Meatman\\", who was responsible for the deaths of several teenagers. She eventually encountered the Meatman, but discovered that he was not responsible for the murders. Cassie befriended the Meatman, a misshapen man named Vlad, and together they hunted down the actual murderer, a local minister/assassin with Mafia connections. The two began travelling together in a van bought with Cassie's inheritance, with Vlad acting as her bodyguard and muscle. =Cassie and Vlad, slasher slayers= Some time later, the pair investigate a series of murders around a veterinary clinic in Eminence, Indiana. They rescue a vet, Lisa, from a slasher who was accidentally killed by Lisa's boyfriend. Later, they investigate a murder at a beach resort hosting a \\"girls gone naughty\\" event. While investigating the situation, Cassie becomes extremely drunk (when a boy drugged her ice tea with pure vodka) and having lost her inhibitions, flirts with a stranger and kisses a random girl. Despite being less than sober, she continues her investigation and encounters a crazed Catholic schoolgirl, Laura Lochs, who controls an undead preacher named Father Wrath. After a prolonged fight, Vlad kills Father Wrath and Cassie sets Laura on fire and leaves her for dead. Soon after, Cassie and Vlad, encounter a pair of slashers murdering writers and illustrators at a Philadelphia comic convention. When Evil Ernie awakens in the Hack/Slash universe he begins a killing spree, murdering six women near a strip club in New Jersey. Cassie and Vlad investigate and track Ernie to a saw mill where he falls in love with Cassie, believing the two of them to be \\"two sides of the same coin\\". After escaping from Ernie, Cassie is distressed by the fact that she now has to kill the \\"one person who loves her\\". Vlad asserts that he loves her, but Cassie snaps and claims that he only thinks that because she's the only one who can stand being around him. Shocked by what she's said, she apologizes to Vlad and the pair resume their hunt for Ernie. Upon finding Ernie, he attempts to kidnap Cassie but accidentally banishes himself to Hell. A tip from Lisa, who has been staying in contact, leads Cassie and Vlad to investigating the circumstances behind nine children dying in their sleep. Their contact, Jason, concludes that the person responsible is Ashley, a Freddy Krueger-esque slasher who can kill people in their dreams. After Jason is also killed, Cassie gets Lisa to knock her out with sleeping gas, so she can confront Ashley in his realm. Despite Ashley's best efforts, he is unable to kill Cassie and she soon turns her own past on him and Ashley is dispatched by Cassie's own worst nightmare: her mother. Afterward, Jason's ex-flatmate, Chris, begins a relationship with Lisa. Later, while setting a trap for a slasher calling herself \\"the Acid Angel\\", Cassie and Vlad discover that a company led by ex-Miss America, Emily Cristy, is capturing slashers in order to perform experiments upon them. Cassie discovers that the company is producing a regenerative drug that turns people into slashers. After the slashers escape, Emily ends up taking the drug to save her life, but has her skin burned off in an explosion, creating a new slasher: Ms. America. Soon afterward, Cassie teams-up with a possessed doll, Chucky, in order to confront Laura Lochs who has returned and stolen Vlad's body using a voodoo amulet. After a series of battles, they defeat Laura once again and Vlad regains control of his body. However, despite Cassie's trying to stop him, Chucky escapes. Cassie is later captured by a slasher who used to be a psychologist who analyzes and tortures her. After losing two toes and remembering various events from her childhood, Cassie self-diagnoses herself as \\"really fucked up\\" and pushes him out of the window. However, later in the bathroom, Cassie's hard exterior falters and she cries. Several days later, after receiving a call from Chris, Cassie and Vlad travel to Tampa Bay to investigate a string of disappearances coinciding with the tour schedule of a band called Acid Washed. Upon getting there, they meet a stripper called Georgia who offers to take them to the next concert. At the show, the band transport all the virgin girls, including Cassie and Georgia, to another realm to be sacrificed. While caged, Cassie talks to a local dog named Pooch, who tells her that the singer, Six Sixx, has made a deal with a demon. Afterwards, Cassie and Georgia flirt and talk about Cassie's undecided sexuality and the possibilities of escaping by \\"making each other impure\\" by having sex. However, Vlad arrives to rescue them and together they return to Earth and defeat Six. Some time later, Cassie is forced to sell her mother's wedding ring in order to pay for better accommodation while Vlad recovers from a respiratory infection. Afterward, they travel to Stone County and encounter a new Father Wrath, who turns out to be nephew of the original. =Search for Dr. Jack Hack= Cassie and Vlad's next adventure leads to a college in Massachusetts where a series of corpses have been discovered. Cassie and Vlad's relationship is somewhat rocky due to the amount of time Cassie has been spending on the phone with Georgia. After Vlad is attacked, Cassie begins questioning the local students and discovers that a number of them are lesbians who are involved in a cult surrounding the mythology of Elizabeth Bathory. After accidentally kissing one of the students (and thinking of Georgia at the time), Cassie interrogates her to find out more information about the cult. However, before the student can lead her to the cult's base of operations, Cassie encounters a government team working for her father. Cassie, Vlad and the government team are led to the cult's underground base where they are attacked by Ms. America, who has been stealing the blood and skin of students in an attempt to regain her original beauty. After a long battle, Vlad impales Ms. America. Afterwards, Cassie and Vlad reconcile, though Cassie is uncertain of her feelings towards Georgia. Following the clues given by the government team, Cassie and Vlad search a cabin in Montana in the hopes of finding information about Cassie's father. What they find is a series of journals detailing how a group of feral children were turned into \\"revenants\\" (i.e., slashers) using a drug. The children then attack and Cassie is forced to shoot them, much to Vlad's objections. Afterwards, Cassie and Vlad hunt down a one-eyed vigilante, Nathan, who Cassie believes is a slasher. However, he is actually a man seeking vengeance for the murder of his wife. After Nathan exacts his revenge (he's fatally wounded in the process) Cassie, still confused by her feelings for Georgia, asks him how he knew that he was in love. Afterwards, Cassie takes a break from searching for her father to investigate a series of killings in Hitchfield, Georgia and encounter a horde of treehuggers and their puppet master, Eddie. Not long after, Georgia contacts Cassie when several of the cast of a Wizard of Oz remake turn up dead. However, despite being told to wait, Georgia investigates on her own and is almost killed by a psychopathic Tin Man. She is soon rescued by an angry Cassie who begs Georgia \\"not to die on [her, because] there's too much death in [her] life already\\". Cassie's search for her father soon comes to an end when she encounters Dr Herbert West, who has been working with Dr Jack Hack in researching slashers. West succeeds in reviving Delilah Hack; however she reverts to her Lunch Lady persona and kills her husband. Disappointed with the results, West kills the Lunch Lady with an overdose of his serum. He then gives Cassie the opportunity to reanimate her father, but she refuses. Losing both her parents once again leaves Cassie deeply depressed, prompting the worried Vlad into calling Georgia and asking her to talk to Cassie. Cassie confides in Georgia that she can't go on killing slashers and wants to live a normal life, thoughts which alienate Vlad. While going to the Mississippi police to tell them all she knows about slashers, Cassie is arrested due to her suspected involvement in homicides throughout the country, the authorities having been led to believe Cassie may be responsible for the murders due to tips from psychic Muffy Joworski (who is being manipulated by the returned Ashley Guthrie, which Cassie and Vlad piece together). While being transported to a detention center Cassie is broken out by the Society of the Black Lamp, who attempt to ritualistically murder her as punishment for destroying slashers. At the last minute Cassie is saved by the vigilante Samhain, who kills the Black Lamp members. Skills and abilities While Cassie has no formal combat training beyond childhood martial arts lessons, Cassie is a skilled close quarters fighter. Her weapon of choice is usually something light and swingable, such as her trademarked baseball bat. She is also adept at using a handgun and has killed many slashers with one. Cassie also has an eye for improvised weaponry and has been known to use all kinds of inanimate objects as makeshift weapons.

It replaced Tagbilaran Airport to support Bohol's increased passenger traffic due to tourism. The airport is dubbed as the first eco-airport in the Philippines and the country’s green gateway. The airport is officially classified as an international airport by the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines. The airport serves as the gateway to Tagbilaran and the rest of mainland Bohol for domestic air travellers. It also is less than an hour's flight from Mactan-Cebu International Airport, which is a gateway to the Central Philippines for international tourists. The project originally approved during of Aquino Administration. Change in Project Scope during Duterte Administration. The airport was inaugurated on November 27, 2018 by President Rodrigo Duterte. History On September 4, 2003, the NEDA Board of the Philippines approved a resolution giving the green light for the construction of the airport. The proposed airport was to be funded through Official Development Assistance (ODA) instead of the Public-Private Partnership (PPP), an infrastructure-building programme of the government of the Philippines wherein the private sector may participate in any of the schemes authorized by its build-operate-transfer law. On March 27, 2013, the Japan International Cooperation Agency signed an agreement with the Republic of the Philippines to build the Bohol–Panglao International Airport at 10.78 billion yen under the project name New Bohol Airport Construction and Sustainable Environment Protection Project. The signing signaled the roll out for the construction of a new airport in the province of Bohol at an island adjacent to Tagbilaran Airport. Despite the location of the airport, which is just outside of Tagbilaran, it adapted the IATA code: TAG from the old airport, which was located in the heart of Tagbilaran. In its initial plan, the project was expected to finish in 2016, but the opening was delayed to November 2018. Construction Initially, the airport's cost was pegged at ₱4.8 billion pesos to build but was later increased. On June 9, 2014, six Japanese firms submitted bids for construction of the proposed airport at a cost of ₱7.14 billion to be funded from official development assistance (ODA) loan from the Japan International Cooperation Agency. On December 15, 2014, the Department of Transportation and Communications started its search for bidders to bid out for the operations and maintenance (and future extension) of the airport under a concession model. The Department of Transport initially planned to award a concession for the operating and maintenance of the airport in combination with two other regional airports. However, in February 2017 the DOTr published an announcement that the project would be tendered as a stand- alone concession, targeting the selection of a contractor in early 2018. Following a change of policy, the concession model was eventually abandoned. Structures and Facilities Aerial view of Bohol-Panglao Airport =Runway= The airport has a asphalt runway that runs in a 03/21 direction. Taxiways E3 and E4 serve as access to the apron from the runway. =Apron= The concrete apron features a total of four (4) parking bays for wide-body aircraft as large as the Airbus A330 or a maximum of seven (7) parking bays for narrow-body aircraft.

Aimed for hearing impaired children, the show was broadcast on ITV (later ITV1) and ITV2 (although it was later re-ran on CITV) between 8 January 1993 to 21 September 2001.  Cuthbert Lilly (1993–2001)  Played by Richard Waites and aided with the catchphrase \\"He's Dead Silly\\". He had brown spiky hair and mostly wore a light pink lily coloured suit with a yellow shirt and a red and white polka dot bow-tie. Cuthbert is one of two characters (the other being The Handymen) to have appeared in every episode from Series 1 to Series 10. His comic sound effect bubbles always appeared pink or lilac coloured from Series 2 onwards, in Series 1, they appeared in a variety of different colours. Cuthbert's scenes follow the general trend of a slapstick comedy, where Cuthbert generally fails to perform simple tasks with disastrous consequences. The sketches often featured the recurring characters of \\"Mr Snooty\\", Cuthbert's antagonist, and the \\"Old Lady\\" who frequently attacks Cuthbert with an umbrella. His trademark characteristic is putting his thumbs up. Two running gags throughout his sketches show Cuthbert reaching out and taking the comic book frame from the edges of the screen before throwing it away, tripping over it or walking over it and Cuthbert repeatedly getting his hand crunched by anyone he tries to shake hands with. Sometimes, if Cuthbert caused trouble, another person like an angry old lady or a policeman would chase after him. Before they did, he would stick his thumbs up to the camera, and then he would run off. Cuthbert is also a friend of Smart Arty and made a few cameos in his sketches mostly helping him solve a problem such as opening a pot of paint or looking after a baby. In Series 1, Cuthbert was introduced with the camera travelling to visit his respective square, which showed a picture of Cuthbert with his thumbs up in the setting that the sketch would take place in. In Series 2 to 9, the square featured a ripped cartoon which he burst through which was reversed to give the effect of him mending the picture and coming into the sketch and in Series 10, frames containing the characters floated around the screen; the respective character's segment would continue when the roulette stopped at them. Cuthbert's panel was always at the Top Row on the left side. The following music was used in his sketches - Toytown, Clowns, Vintage Hollywood, Pony Trotting And Animal Capers, they are all production music. He was at the Top row on the left side.  Smart Arty (1993–1998)  Smart Arty is a caricatured French painter who featured in Series 1 to Series 7 and was played by Neil Buchanan. Smart's trademark is to blow the unseen audience kisses at the beginning and end of every segment. His comic sound effect bubbles always appeared dark pink. All of Smart Arty sketches began with him painting the same picture of himself. In Series 1, the sketches featured Smart creating large pictures out of rather unusual objects. From Series 2 onwards, the sketches involved drawings created with a magic pen which brought his many drawings to life This was performed in the style of Maurice Minor sketches in Kenny Everett's shows and the cartoon Penny Crayon. his sketches were accompanied by the music of Boccherini's Menuet and Trio, from his String Quartet in E. He is also a friend of Cuthbert Lily and made a few cameos in his sketches mostly helping him solve problems such as photography and painting. In recognition of ZZZAP one of the Art Attack 'Big Art Attacks' featured on the show was a giant picture of Smart Arty. Smart Arty would always do the same thing at the start of each sketch. He would always wave at the camera and would do 2 hops to the wall. Smart Arty's first ever sketch on the program was in Series 1, Episode 1, when he made a black sellotape picture of Laurel and Hardy. His last ever sketch was in Series 7, Episode 16. The sketch showed him planting some seeds in his garden. He was at the Bottom Row on the right side.  The Handymen (1993–2001)  The Handymen are two gloved hands; one yellow and one blue and were played by Sarah Pickthall. The Handymen are one of two segments of the show (the other being Cuthbert Lilly) to have appeared in every episode from Series 1 to Series 10. The Handymen didn't have any comic sound effect bubbles. The sketches are performed in a theatre with an audience composed entirely of hands. The Handymen appear on stage, either making an object or performing a magic trick. Whenever the Handymen used an object to perform something, there would be a cardboard sign attached to it, stating what the object was. The Handymen had the same music in all of their sketches from Series 1 to Series 7, but in Series 8 to 10 the featured music varied each episode. but every now and than the original theme was played. The Handymen were at the Top Row on the right side.  Tricky Dicky's Mission Impossible (1993)  Tricky Dicky was played by Richard Waites and was featured in Series 1. He was always seen wearing a black hat, a mask, a grey trench coat and black plimsolls. He would sometimes wear wellies in the event of a muddy task. His trademark was a very high and slightly creepy giggle. His eyes only appeared at the beginning of his sketches. His comic sound effect bubbles appeared in different colors such as black, white, blue and green. His sketches involved him writing a challenge on his typewriter, that would then have to be performed by a selection of children. The challenges initially sounded simple (for example, having to pour custard on a pudding), but they featured a twist that made it more difficult (i.e. the custard might be in a wheelbarrow and the pudding at the end of an obstacle course) The children would often give a black and white speech bubble of \\"Oh No!\\" and Tricky Dicky would hold up a speech bubble sign saying \\"Oh Yes!\\". Depending on whether the children failed or succeeded in completing the task, at the end of the sketch Tricky would hold up a sign reading - \\"Mission Impossible\\" or \\"Mission Possible\\" respectively. The character of Tricky Dicky was dropped after Series 1, as the character was deemed too scary for younger viewers. He was in the centre in the middle below the clown square.  Daisy Dares You (1994–2001)  Daisy Dare was featured in Series 2 to 10 and was the replacement for Tricky Dicky and was played by Deborah McCallum for Series 2 to 8 and Claire Macaulay for Series 9 and 10. Daisy was always seen wearing yellow and black checks, and was supposedly a young, freckled, cheeky schoolgirl in dungarees. Her hair was always tied into her trademark style of two bunches, secured with yellow bows. Her comic sound effect bubbles always appeared canary yellow. Much like the Tricky Dicky sketches featured in the first series, Daisy would set difficult challenges for a small group of children who were selected from local schools or drama organisations. If the children succeeded in performing the challenge, Daisy would start to cry or throw a tantrum, but if they all failed, Daisy would laugh and celebrate her victory. From Series 8 onwards, Daisy had to do the challenge herself if the kids succeeded. She would get covered in mouldy food or would fall into the swimming pool. If she fell in, the kids laughed and said hurrah. In the last episode of Series 2 to Series 10, Daisy would set children a task where they would get themselves in trouble (usually by throwing food or gunge balloons at a policeman, some old ladies, or angry members of the public) but the plan would usually backfire and get Daisy into trouble. Daisy would also whistle to give the children a signal to perform. She is in the centre of the middle row, below the clown/dot to dot square. Daisy was one of the show's most popular characters and also one of the longest-running. In Series 2 to 7, she was voiced by Neil Buchanan (who was also Smart Arty). In Series 8 onwards, she was voiced by Sophie Aldred (who was also Minnie The Mini Magician).  Minnie The Mini Magician (1999–2001)  Minnie Magic was played by Sophie Aldred and was featured in Series 8 to 10 and was the replacement for Smart Arty. Her comic sound effect bubbles always appeared orange. Minnie was a magician in training who wore an L-plate around her neck to show this. Her magic performances usually go wrong or backfire on her, and whenever they did, she would sigh her catchphrase of \\"Oh well!\\" before tapping her learner sign. Sometimes she succeeds and twiddles her glasses, saying her other catchphrase \\"Magic!\\" She is at the Bottom Row on the Right Side.

see The Most Incredible Thing (album) “The Most Incredible Thing\\" () is a literary fairy tale by Danish poet and author Hans Christian Andersen (1805-1875). The story is about a contest to find the most incredible thing and the wondrous consequences when the winner is chosen. The tale was first published in an English translation by Horace Scudder, an American correspondent of Andersen's, in the United States in September 1870 before being published in the original Danish in Denmark in October 1870. \\"The Most Incredible Thing\\" was the first of Andersen's tales to be published in Denmark during World War II. Andersen considered the tale one of his best. Plot summary Illustration from the first US publication, in The Riverside Magazine for Young People, September 1870 When the tale begins, a contest has been proclaimed in which half the kingdom and the hand of the princess in marriage will be the rewards of he who can produce the most incredible thing. A poor young man creates a magnificent clock with different lifelike figures — Moses, Adam and Eve, the Four Seasons, the Five Senses, and others — which appear at the stroke of the hour. All agree the clock is the most incredible thing and its creator is named the winner. Suddenly, another man smashes the clock and all then agree that this act is even more incredible than the creation of the beautiful clock. The destroyer is to wed the princess, but at the wedding, the figures of the clock magically reappear, defeat him, and then vanish. All agree that this is the most incredible thing, and the princess and the young creator of the clock marry. =The figures= Each hour on the clock is represented by a figure from the Bible, mythology, folklore or common knowledge.The Most Incredible Thing (1870)http://hca.gilead.org.il/inkling/most_incredible.html *One o'clock: Moses, writing the first of the ten commandments *Two o'clock: Adam and Eve *Three o'clock: The Three Wise Men *Four o'clock: The Four Seasons, represented by a cuckoo bird (spring), a grasshopper (summer), an empty stork's nest (autumn), and an old crow (winter) *Five o'clock: The Five Senses, represented by a spectacle maker (sight), a coppersmith (hearing), a flower girl (smell), a cook (taste), and an undertaker (touch) *Six o'clock: A gambler, who always rolled sixes *Seven o'clock: The seven days of the week, or the seven deadly sins *Eight o'clock: A choir of eight singing monks *Nine o'clock: The Muses of Greek mythology *Ten o'clock: Moses returns with the rest of the Ten Commandments *Eleven o'clock: Eleven children played and sang \\"Two and two and seven, the clock has struck eleven\\" *Twelve o'clock: A night watchman announces the birth of Christ Sources The tale has no counterpart in traditional folk and fairy lore but is entirely original with Andersen. Its inspiration is ascribed to Andersen's distress over the Franco-Prussian War and the wars between Denmark and Prussia in the 1860s. Andersen had been warmly received in Germany and the poet loved German high culture but he was completely shocked by the nation's descent into militarism. He was heartbroken with the realization that it would be necessary for him to sever ties with his German friends. Publication history Andersen in 1867 The tale was first published as “The Most Extraordinary Thing” in an English translation by Horace Scudder in the United States in The Riverside Magazine for Young People in September 1870. The Danish original appeared in Denmark in the journal Nyt Dansk Maanedsskrift a month later in October 1870. The tale was reprinted in Denmark on 30 March 1872 and again on 20 December 1874 in collections of Andersen's tales. Andersen enjoyed performing before an audience and promoted many of his tales by reading them aloud at social gatherings. In the 1840s, the composer Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy was present at such a reading in Germany and reported he was so elated and excited by the performance that he couldn't wait to thank Andersen but \\"jubilantly flew\\" at the poet exclaiming: \\"But you are a marvelous reader; no one reads fairy tales like you!\\" Many years later in the 1870s, the English author and critic Edmund Gosse had a similar perception and noted, \\"As soon as he spoke, yes, if he merely smiled, he genius was evident ... And as he read, everything I was looking at--the dazzling sails, the sea, the coast of Sweden, the bright sky--was set ablaze as the sun went down. It was as if nature itself were blushing with delight at the sound of Hans Christian Andersen's voice.\\" Andersen managed to read aloud \\"The Most Incredible Thing\\" at least seven times within a matter of days. The readings began before a circle of admirers at the home of the Koch family on the day the tale was finished. Over the next several days, he visited the homes of several others including the Hartmanns, the Collins, the Thieles, and the Melchiors. Andersen used such readings to gauge the success of his compositions: the louder and longer the audience's applause, the fewer corrections he would make to the tale and the sooner the manuscript reached the publisher's office. Commentaries For fairy tale and folk lore researcher Maria Tatar, the tale summarizes Andersen's views on the \\"essence of art\\" with the clock representing both temporality and transcendence. It keeps time but it is also a work of art that cannot be destroyed. She notes that the clock houses both \\"the biblical and the mythical, the seasons and the senses, the visual and the acoustical, the carnal and the spiritual\\" and thus brings together everything Andersen wanted in art. The wondrous clock \\"mingles the secular with the sacred and the pagan with the Christian\\". The beauty of the clock and its figurines defy and transcend destruction and continue to live in a way that humans cannot. Cultural impact \\"The Most Incredible Thing\\" was the first Andersen story published during the Nazi occupation of Denmark during World War II. The introduction to the July 1940 edition suggested Andersen had written the tale in profound anxiety and doubt over the future that \\"was superseded with an even more profound faith.\\" In 1942, the tale was published in a volume of stories organized by scholars who would later become leaders of the Danish Resistance Movement. In the tale's final illustration to the 1942 edition, the night watchman is a bearded rabbi who strikes down the brawny semi-naked Aryan destroyer of the clock while a crowd of Danes in contemporary 1940s dress stands by and watches. Stage Adaptations=Pet Shop Boys Ballet= In 2011 British pop act Pet Shop Boys wrote the music for a ballet based on the story that opened in March 2011 at Sadler's Wells in London.http://www.petshopboys.co.uk/news/2601 The story was adapted by Matthew Dunster and featured choreography by Javier de Frutos. It starred former Royal Ballet principal Ivan Putrov and animated film created by Tal Rosner.

The swimming pool is visible close to the ocean's edge at top right. Second Beach and the head of Forbury Hill The Frances Hodgkins Retirement Village and the spire of Dunedin's LDS Church meetinghouse are visible against the cliffs of the former quarry that lies to the west of Forbury Road. Valpy Street is named for the suburb's founding father, W.H. Valpy. His homestead was located close to the brown and white house on the slopes of Forbury Hill in the background of this picture. Tudor architectural style St Clair is a leafy residential suburb of Dunedin, New Zealand. It is located on the Pacific Ocean coast five kilometres from the city centre on the southwesternmost part of the coastal plain which makes up the southern part of the urban area, and also climbs the slopes of Forbury Hill immediately to the west of this plain. St Clair's 2001 population was 4,179. Geography St Clair's main geographical features are St Clair Beach and the promontory of Forbury Hill which rises above the plain. The summit of the hill lies within the grounds of St Clair Golf Course, in the west of the suburb. Forbury Hill's flanks include a large cliff face one kilometre inland from the beach and a rocky headland which juts into the Pacific Ocean. The small outcrop of White Island lies to the immediate south of St Clair beach. The inland cliff, which runs parallel with and to the west of Forbury Road, was the site of a quarry in the early days of the city. The city's largest retirement village and its only meetinghouse for the LDS Church both lie in the shadow of this cliff. A small stream runs from the flank of Forbury Hill, passing into a culvert before reaching the sea at the western end of St Clair Beach. Bedford Street, a main thoroughfare from the flat part of the suburb to its hillier parts, follows the steep valley of this stream for much of its short length. The suburb is surrounded by the suburbs of Corstorphine, Kew, Forbury, and St Kilda. Its main roads are Forbury Road, Bedford Street, Bay View Road, Ravenswood Road, and Allandale Road, with a small shopping area close to the junction of Allandale and Forbury Roads. Victoria Road, which begins at the edge of the suburb, also links it with St. Kilda. An esplanade runs along the coast from the southern end of Forbury Road (where it joins Bedford Street and Victoria Road), and is the site of several restaurants and cafes. =St Clair Beach and Second Beach= St Clair Beach is the suburb's most well-known feature. It is the western end of the long beach (Ocean Beach) which stretches along the city's southern shore, and is a popular surfing venue, regularly hosting national and South Island surfing championships. The beach at St Clair is backed by sea wall, behind which is an esplanade consisting of pedestrian walkway and a one-way street. The eastern end of the esplanade leads onto a pathway across the dunes which run along the back of the beach a far as St Kilda. The beach and the dunes are often the victims of erosion if weather patterns see series of storms hit the city from the south. Such erosion between 2002 and 2007 saw emergency measures taken to add sand to the dunes in 2007 and 2008. Further erosion in 2013–2015 encroached on the dunes to the extent that a public footpath inland from the top of the dunes was permanently closed. The erosion is a long-term ongoing concern, as evidenced by attempts at beach protecting begun in 1904 which saw the addition of sturdy wooden piles and sandbreaks to the beach. The last surviving sets of wooden posts from these efforts are a landmark of St Clair Beach, often seen as being the dividing line between St Clair and Middle Beaches. Heavy storms during the winter of 2015 left these posts in a poor condition, and it is likely they will not survive many more years. Remedial work has to be frequently undertaken to shore up the dunes, and there is considerable local concern about the long-term viability of the residential area behind them. The presence of an old landfill immediately behind the dunes exacerbates the potential environmental problems from the erosion.\\"Dunedin's environmental time bomb: Between the sea and the landfill,\\" Otago Daily Times, 27 September 2019. Retrieved 1 May 2020. At their western end, the beach and esplanade culminate in a small promontory, immediately beneath which sits St Clair hot saltwater pool, a lido-style pool nestled within a natural rock outcrop. A 1000 metre-long walking track leads from behind the pool to cliffs at the head of Forbury Hill, along a ridge behind Second Beach. Second Beach is rocky rather than sandy, and is flanked by a natural amphitheatre of cliffs. These cliffs include hexagonal basalt columns, one of three such outcrops in Dunedin (the others being at Blackhead, further to the west, and at the Organ Pipes formation on Mount Cargill. The walking track is well- tended, and traverses an area which is now largely wild but was the site of quarrying operations in the early days of Dunedin. Only the overgrown remnants of concrete and stone walls remain of this today as indications of this history. A distinctive feature of the area is a natural blowhole in the foot of Forbury Head, located close to the southwestern end of the walking track. From this point, there is a panoramic view along Dunedin's southern coast and along the Pacific coast of Otago Peninsula as far as Lion's Head Rock at the entrance to Sandfly Bay, to the east. Modern St Clair St Clair Beach is a popular summer destination for Dunedinites. It is one of the South Island's more popular surfing venues and is also home to the St Clair Surf Life Saving Club. At the western end of the beach, under the shadow of Forbury Hill, lies the St Clair Hot Salt Water Pool, an open-air public swimming pool nestled within rocks a handful of metres from the sea. The beach is also the site of the city's annual \\"midwinter plunge\\", which sees residents brave the chilly waters every year at the winter solstice. The beach's sea wall, esplanade and oceanway were rebuilt and renovated in 2004. In recent years the esplanade area has become a hub of culture with many cafes, restaurants and bars. One of the city's wealthier suburbs, many fine houses are situated in the upper part of St Clair on the slopes of Forbury Hill. This part of the suburb is often referred to as St Clair Park, possibly a reference to the St Clair golf course - one of the city's main courses - which straddles the top of the hill. Near to this are the ruins of Cargill's Castle, a former stately home built for early settler Edward Cargill in 1877.Herd, J. & Griffiths, G.J. (1980). Discovering Dunedin. Dunedin: John McIndoe. . The twin single-sex secondary schools of King's and Queen's lie close to the point where St Clair, St Kilda and Forbury meet. As a residential suburb, industrial activity in 21st-century St Clair is negligible. Forbury The smaller, less well-defined suburb of Forbury () lies immediately to the north of St Clair, between it and Caversham. Forbury lies largely in the shadow of the cliff face that is located one kilometre inland from St Clair Beach, and stretches to the east of this cliff across the plain towards South Dunedin. Apart from Caversham and St Clair, Forbury is bounded by St Kilda in the south, Kew in the west, and South Dunedin in the east. The name Forbury is somewhat confusing, as it is used for several local features, not all of them within the suburb. Notable among these is Forbury Park Raceway, one of the city's main horse-racing venues, which actually lies in St Kilda. Forbury Corner, an important road junction, lies in Caversham, though not far from the northern boundary of Forbury. Prominent features of Forbury include Tonga Park, a sports ground used by Caversham Football Club, and the twin single-sex secondary schools, King's and Queen's. Forbury Road is the suburb's main arterial route, aligned roughly north-south and linking Caversham at Forbury Corner with St Clair at the Esplanade. The suburb's other main roads include Bay View Road, Macandrew Road, Surrey Street, and Easther Crescent. History There is known to have been Māori settlement in the area close to what is now St Clair Esplanade in pre-European times, with artefacts having been discovered close to the western end of the Esplanade and also occasionally uncovered in the dunes which lie to the east. It is believed that there was also a burial site close to Cargill's Castle.Newton, B. A. (2003). Our St Clair - A resident's history. Dunedin: Kenmore. A major pre-European track led along the length of the dunes and from there over Forbury Hill to connect with the land to the south.Goodall, M. and Griffiths, G. (1980) Maori Dunedin. Dunedin: Otago Heritage Books. The name Whakaherekau was used by Māori for the coastal strip encompassing parts of what are now St Kilda and St Clair. This has been translated as meaning either \\"To make a conciliatory present\\" or \\"A prepared snare which caught nothing\\". Early European settlement in the area was led by William Henry Valpy (1793–1852). Valpy and his family arrived in New Zealand in 1849, setting up a farm property centred on what are now Valpy Street and Norfolk Street. The property was named \\"The Forbury\\" after Forbury Gardens, a public gardens in Reading, Berkshire. Valpy was born in Reading, where his father Richard Valpy had been a schoolmaster. Valpy was reputedly the wealthiest man in New Zealand. Chinese settlers were notable among early residents in the St Clair area, and largely through their effort the swampy land inland from the beach was drained, and converted into market gardens. Much of the young city's vegetable production was centred on Chinese allotments in an area close to what is now Macandrew Road, Forbury. Habitation remained sparse until the early twentieth century, but rapid growth immediately prior to World War I saw the population expand. The suburb was largely populated by the city's more wealthy residents, with impressive houses by Francis Petre built close to the beach in Cliffs Road, two of which survive.Dungey, Kim (31 December 2009) Petre designed Tudor-style home. Otago Daily Times p. 41. Noted early residents included the Petres, the Cargills, the Sideys (including Sir Thomas Sidey), and the McIndoes. The McIndoe family included the founder of one of the city's main printing firms, John McIndoe, and Sir Archibald McIndoe, a pioneer in the field of plastic surgery. There was also major industry in the early days of the suburb, with both horticulture and quarrying being of importance. The latter supplied many of the materials for C & W Shiel's brickworks, one of the early city's most important industries. The brickworks lay on the eastern side of Forbury Road with a quarry to the west (the quarry is now the site of the LDS Church meetinghouse and the Francis Hodgkins Retirement village); the brickworks were fed via a conveyor over a structure which bridged Forbury Road.Newton 2003, p. 64. St Clair Beach has been a popular attraction for Dunedinites since the early days of the city. In 1912 a grandiose two-storeyed pavilion was erected on the esplanade, which was a popular if short-lived structure, burning to the ground in 1915. The site of the pavilion was later used for a band rotunda, though it too has long gone. The cliffs above Second Beach were the site of a gun battery – part of a coastal defence system – from the 1880s until the end of World War I. Nothing now remains of the battery, the site of which was later subdivided for residential use. In May 2013, the suburb's esplanade began collapsing, with numerous sinkholes appearing in the walkway. Walls meant to block off the sea, built in 2004 to replace those built in the 1880s and 1914, were leaking. The Esplanade was repaired, but erosion of the dunes immediately to the east continues, threatening the long-term viability of coastal properties in the vicinity.

It is sited at the western edge of the city's central plain at the mouth of the steep Caversham Valley, which rises to the saddle of Lookout Point. Major road and rail routes south lie nearby; the South Island Main Trunk railway runs through the suburb, and a bypass skirts its main retail area, connecting Dunedin's one-way street system with the Dunedin Southern Motorway. The suburb is linked by several bus routes to its neighbouring suburbs and central Dunedin. The suburb was founded by wealthy pioneer William Henry Valpy, and its name reflects his family connections with the town of Reading, in the English county of Berkshire. Caversham grew rapidly during the Central Otago Gold Rush of the 1860s because of its location on routes south to the Otago hinterland. By the end of the 19th century, Caversham was heavily industrialised, and its population included many skilled or semi-skilled tradespeople. This, combined with the community's strong Protestant roots, led to the area's generally left-leaning political stance. Caversham's early history has been the subject of the Caversham Project, a major historical and archaeological study by the University of Otago. Caversham was a separate borough until 1904, when it was amalgamated with Dunedin city. It is currently administered as part of the city's South Dunedin ward. At a national level, it is part of the Dunedin South electorate. Caversham is now predominantly residential, with some industrial premises in the east (notably the Hillside Railway Workshops) and a retail district centred on South Road and Hillside Road. Residents are generally of low socio-economic status. Caversham's notable buildings include the heritage listed Lisburn House and several prominent church buildings. Another landmark is the suburb's war memorial, which is the main gate of Caversham School, one of the suburb's two primary schools. Caversham also contains a special-needs school. The nearest secondary schools operate in St Clair, to the south. Caversham has strong sporting connections, and is the location of Carisbrook, until recently one of Dunedin's main sports venues. The suburb is home to the Southern Rugby Football Club, and gives its name to Caversham Football Club. Several notable sportspeople have associations with Caversham, among them Test cricketer Clarrie Grimmett and father and son rugby union administrators \\"Old Vic\\" and \\"Young Vic\\" Cavanagh. Other notable people with Caversham connections include politician Thomas Kay Sidey, architect Edmund Anscombe, and surveyor John Turnbull Thomson. Geography Caversham lies at the mouth and in the lower reaches of a valley in the west of Dunedin's main urban area, southwest of the city centre, and north of the Pacific coast at St Clair. To the south lies Calton Hill, a spur of Forbury Hill, on which the suburbs of Calton Hill, Corstorphine and Kew are located.\\"Caversham Map and Directions\\". Yellow Maps New Zealand. Retrieved on 2009-04-06. Note: This map incorrectly refers to Calton Hill as \\"Carlton Hill\\". The suburbs of Balaclava and Maryhill lie to the north, close to the western end of the ridge that runs along the northern edge of central Dunedin. These hills were all once part of the rim of the Dunedin volcano, the long-extinct crater of which now forms Otago Harbour.Bishop, p. 13 Other suburbs nearby include Forbury, South Dunedin, Kensington, and Lookout Point. Caversham Valley has long been the major route out of the central city to the south.Rutherford, p. 6 The suburb is located close to the start of the Dunedin Southern Motorway (part of State Highway 1), the main road access to central Dunedin from the south, and close to the South Island Main Trunk railway. The creation of the Dunedin Southern Motorway redirected traffic away from South Road, the main thoroughfare through Caversham. The railway provides the suburb's most important industry, through the Hillside Railway Workshops, which are located in the southeast of the suburb and in the adjoining suburb of South Dunedin. Despite this, there are no longer any public railway stations or halts in Caversham, the last station having closed in 1962.Rutherford, p. 37 The hill slopes to the north of Caversham are less densely populated, and still retain some tree cover. This, along with the steepness of the land, forms a natural barrier between Caversham and the suburb of Maryhill. Only a few winding roads traverse this barrier, most notably Glen Road, at the eastern end of Caversham. At this end, the suburb draws close to the foot of the hills, and a natural valley, known locally as \\"The Glen\\", provides easier road access to the hill ridge.Olssen, p. 21 To the northeast of the Glen, a hill spur including a cliff separates Caversham from the central part of the city. Though the name is rarely used, this spur is called Montecillo Ridge, named for the mansion of early settler W.H. Reynolds. It is occasionally referred to as \\"Hillside\\", after the house of the city's founding father Captain William Cargill which was located here.Herd, p. 40 This ridge overlooks \\"The Flat\\", as the plain stretching across to the Pacific coast was (and is still) locally known. South Road winds around the spur, connecting with the southern end of Princes Street. One of the city's older and more historic cemeteries, Dunedin Southern Cemetery, lies on the inner city side of this spur.Herd, pp. 112-113 =Lookout Point= From Lookout Point, Caversham Valley Road descends rapidly. This image shows the view east across South Dunedin to Otago Harbour, with Otago Peninsula in the background. At the top of Caversham Valley are a ridge and the saddle of Lookout Point.Sorrell, p. 302 Lookout Point commands views to the southwest past the outer suburbs of Burnside and Green Island to Saddle Hill, as well as providing a view to the east across the southern part of the central city to Otago Harbour and the Otago Peninsula. The most prominent building in Lookout Point is the local fire station, which also serves both Caversham and Green Island.Rutherford, p. 30 This 1956 structure is located immediately to the north of the saddle and is a prominent landmark upon entering or leaving Dunedin. Not far from the fire station to the north-east is Dunedin's tallest tree, a eucalyptus measuring an estimated 100 metres. The Dunedin Southern Motorway officially begins at the Lookout Point saddle, between Calton Hill and Maryhill, and sweeps down over broken hill country past Green Island to Mosgiel and the Taieri Plains.New Zealand Automobile Association. Greater Dunedin and Invercargill Street Directory, 1998 edition. Map 16. Lookout Point is also the home of the former Caversham Industrial School, located to the northeast of the fire station on Mornington Road. Established in 1869, the school was later a boys' home, and is now an adult training centre. Lookout Point's main streets include South Road, Caversham Valley Road, Riselaw Road, and Mornington Road. The Māori name for Lookout Point is Ko Raka-a-runga-te- raki. It was the burial site of chief Rangi-Ihia, a late 18th-century Kati Mamoe chief who was largely responsible for joining the Kai Tahu and Kati Mamoe iwi. He was buried here so that \\"his spirit might see thence his old haunts to the southward.\\"Canon J. W. Stack (1898), quoted in Goodall, p. 18 A forest reserve is located on the upper slopes of Caversham Valley below Lookout Point.

History Caversham Presbyterian Church Caversham was named for Caversham, Berkshire, a suburb of Reading, by William Henry Valpy, a wealthy early settler who farmed the areas around the lower slopes of Forbury Hill; his initial farm, \\"The Forbury\\", was located in what is now St Clair, close to a street which now bears his name. A member of Valpy's family was born in the English Caversham.Reed, p.72. Some sources (e.g., Erik Olssen op.cit. p. 19) say that Valpy's wife was born in Caversham, Berkshire; Reed says that it was his mother who was born there. In the early days of Dunedin, it was impossible for a dray to reach the Caversham Valley in wet weather unless it went by a circuitous route around the hills. Valpy solved this problem by hiring men at his own expense to build a crude road from the southern end of Princes Street to his farm at Forbury. This formed the basis for later roads into the suburb.Rutherford, p. 5. The road curved around the edge of the hills at the Glen to avoid a large swamp, the site of which is currently occupied by Carisbrook sports ground. St. Peter's Anglican Church, Hillside Road Settlement in the area was slow, though Caversham Valley was a preferred route south out of the city. The Central Otago Gold Rush of 1861 led to rapid changes when thousands of people began using the road on their way to and from the gold fields. The suburb began to expand rapidly at about this time, and the first public house, the Edinburgh Castle Hotel, was erected in 1861. By the end of the decade, Caversham had its own school, post office, drill hall (from the Southern District Rifles), and Anglican and Presbyterian churches. A third church, for the Baptist denomination, followed in 1872.Rutherford, pp. 11-13 Several charitable organisations have had properties in Caversham, including the Otago Benevolent Institution home for invalids, and an IHC New Zealand centre at Kew Park.

Caversham rail tunnel was designed for twin tracks but is now only used by one. Early industries in the area included C & W Sheil's brickworks, which had quarries in Forbury, St Clair and Caversham, and Caversham Gasworks, which operated from 1882 until 1909. The last buildings of the gasworks were a local landmark, and were not removed until the construction of the Caversham bypass in the 1970s and 1980s.Sorrell, p. 284 Other noted industries in early Caversham included breweries, a tannery, and a match factory.Olssen, p. 20 Construction of the South Island Main Trunk railway south of Dunedin that began in 1871 led to the construction of a tunnel beneath Lookout Point, connecting Caversham with Green Island.Fox, Rebecca (2008-08-11). \\"Caversham Tunnel Promoted for Access\\".

This led to some degree of antagonism by the councils of the city and Caversham borough in the early days of settlement; Dunedin had been settled by the Presbyterian church, whereas Caversham's population was largely Anglican, Methodist, and Baptist. There is little evidence of this distinction in modern Caversham, other than the origins of local street names, several of which reflect the names of English counties and early English settlers.Olssen, pp. 21-23Brosnahan, p. 7. Caversham began largely as a lower-middle to working-class suburb. Many of the early residents were skilled or semi-skilled tradespeople. In its early days, Caversham was known as \\"The carpenters' borough\\", as a high proportion of the skilled workers within the borough were employed in the building trade.Brosnahan, p. 25 The socioeconomic mix of the borough, combined with the Protestant religious make-up of Caversham, led to strong traditions of egalitarian and social humanitarian politics in the borough.Olssen, pp. 155-187 and passim The left-leaning politics of the area is still reflected to some extent in local political views. The Dunedin South electorate, of which Caversham is a part, tends to return New Zealand Labour Party Members of Parliament and support this and other left-of-centre parties.In the 22 general elections between 1946 and 2008, the Dunedin South electorate and its predecessor, the St. Kilda electorate, have returned Labour candidates on all but two occasions.

Economy Hillside Road, looking east from Forbury Corner In its early years, Caversham was heavily industrialised, but also contained a large number of residential properties. The population included a large number of skilled tradespeople and craftspeople, and both large and small industries abounded. Local industries at the beginning of the twentieth century included a brickworks, a gasworks, breweries, a smithy, milliners, several bakeries, a tannery, a bootmakers, and Rutherford's Wax Vesta match factory at Forbury Corner. In 1900, the South Road-David Street-Forbury Corner area was home to over 50 businesses.Olssen, pp. 20-26 Today, the suburb is mainly residential, though it has areas of retail and light industrial businesses. The main retail area is on South Road between the start of the rise up Caversham Valley and David Street, extending into David Street and the western end of Hillside Road (Forbury Corner, sometimes referred to as Kew Corner). A few shops are also located on South Road to the east, near Carisbrook. Hillside Road becomes increasingly light industrial as it approaches South Dunedin, with automotive engineers, car sales yards, joineries, a rope factory, and a funeral parlour. One of Dunedin's largest industrial sites, the Hillside Railway Workshops, dominates the eastern end of Hillside Road, close to which lie other, smaller, industrial sites. Beyond this is the shopping precinct of South Dunedin. Caversham has four public houses – considerably fewer than in its formative years.Rutherford, pp. 6-10 These are the Carisbrook Hotel, close to the sports ground for which it is named, Mitchell's Tavern in the South Road retail area, the Waterloo Hotel at Forbury Corner, and the Fitzroy Hotel on Hillside Road near Bathgate Park.

The latter of these lies at the Glen at the eastern end of Caversham, providing a link between South Road and the hill suburbs of Maryhill, Balaclava, and Mornington. A Caversham bypass was constructed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and was officially opened in 1987. It now carries State Highway 1 away from the retail heart of the suburb, connecting at its northern end with the city's one-way street system. With the construction of the bypass, Caversham Valley Road was truncated close to its junction with South Road, and the upper stretch of the road continued as part of State Highway 1, connecting the bypass with Dunedin Southern Motorway. Until the construction of the bypass, South Road and Caversham Valley Road formed the main route out of Dunedin to the south. State Highway 1 followed South Road through the main retail area, then followed Caversham Valley Road to Lookout Point.McLintock, A.H., (ed.) (1960) A Descriptive Atlas of New Zealand. Wellington: R.

The suburb is separate from the contiguous urban area of Dunedin. The suburb is residential, and contains a significant number of smaller homes. The area is a popular residence for students from the University of Otago, and is also popular with alternative lifestylers. The suburb consists mainly of two roughly parallel roads, the Dunedin-Port Chalmers highway (State Highway 88), which runs close to the harbour, and St Leonards Drive, the former main route to Port Chalmers, which winds around the lower slopes of the hills on which St Leonards sits. The Port Chalmers Branch railway line runs parallel with the highway next to the harbour's edge. In 2012, the Dunedin Harbour Cycleway was extended to reach St Leonards. The suburbs of St Leonards, Maia, Burkes, and Ravensbourne, are often collectively referred to as West Harbour.

City Rise is an inner suburb of the New Zealand city of Dunedin. One of the city's older suburbs, it is, as its name suggests, centred on the slopes which lie close to the city centre, particularly those closest to the city's original heart of The Exchange (for this reason, places are said to be on the City Rise rather than in City Rise). Extensive views across the central city can be gained from much of City Rise. The name City Rise is generally applied to the area immediately to the west of Princes Street, especially to the approximately triangular area of one square kilometre bounded by Princes Street and the city's Town Belt, with Maitland Street and Stuart Street lying at the edge of the area. Some parts of the lower slopes at one time carried the name Fernhill, a term still occasionally encountered to refer to this area. Other notable streets on the City Rise include High Street, Rattray Street, Stafford Street, Arthur Street, Canongate, and Serpentine Avenue. The name City Rise is sometime used to cover a wider area extending further to the north along the inner edge of the Town Belt from Stuart Street and Moana Pool as far as the stately house Olveston and to the top of Pitt Street. City Rise contains many of the city's earliest grand residences, notably along High Street and streets close to it. Many of these buildings were built on money which flowed into the infant city at the time of the Central Otago Gold Rush of 1861-2. Notable houses include Threave (designed by Robert Lawson), Moata, and Colquhouns, among many others. The suburb is bounded by the central city to the east and northeast, by Kensington to the south, and Mornington to the west. The small suburb of Belleknowes lies immediately to the north, beyond which is Roslyn. The suburb is mainly residential, though it also has strong links with the city's education. Otago Boys' High School lies close to Stuart Street in the north of City Rise, and the original site of Otago Polytechnic (or, as it was at the time, King Edward Technical College) is also on the city rise side of Stuart Street. Otago Girls' High School is located closer to the city centre at the edge of City Rise. Arthur Street School is also located in the suburb, close to Otago Boys' High School. Next to Arthur Street School's grounds is a monument on what was the site of Dunedin's first cemetery, Arthur Street Cemetery. There is very little industry centred on City Rise, the most notable exception being Speight's Brewery, which is located at the foot of the rise close to the exchange. Immediately above this is St. Joseph's Cathedral, the city's Roman Catholic cathedral. Notable historical industrial connections with the suburb include Choie (Charles) Sew Hoy's importing company and the Kempthorne Prosser chemical manufacturing company, both of which had their main offices on Stafford Street. From the 1880s until the 1950s, City Rise was served by Dunedin's cable tramway, with lines running up from the Exchange to the hill suburbs of Mornington and Roslyn via Stuart Street and Rattray Street. The tramway was notable for being only the second of its type in the world (after the San Francisco cable car system). Belleknowes Belleknowes is a smaller suburb, nestled within the Town Belt close to the points where City Rise, Mornington, and Roslyn meet. Its most notable feature is Belleknowes Golf Course, the closest golf course to the centre of Dunedin. Also of note within the suburb are several parks such as Jubilee Park and Robin Hood Park, the latter of which is home to the Beverly-Begg Observatory.

Established in the 1950s as a commuter settlement, it is located to the southwest of Dunedin city centre, and lies within the city's limits. Waldronville was developed by Bill Waldron, when he purchased the McCraws farm in the early 1950s, initially for 200 houses. In the mid-1970s, two other streets were added to the southwest of the settlement. In the mid-1990s, Friendship Drive and Wavy Knowes developments were added to the northeast. The township of Brighton lies to the southeast of Waldronville; the tiny settlement of Westwood lies halfway between Brighton and Waldronville. Waldronville is located close to the Kaikorai Lagoon, an expanse of water at the mouth of the Kaikorai Stream protected from the ocean by a sandbar which stretches inland almost as far as the Dunedin suburb of Green Island, to the north. The lagoon is part of a research project aimed at establishing a national estuarine monitoring protocol.Hamel, A. (2008) Dunedin Tracks and Trails.

Life After studying at several gymnasia, Siegmund-Schultze studied philosophy and theology in Breslau and Magdeburg. In 1908 he became the secretary of the Church Committee for friendly relations between Great Britain and Germany (Kirchlichen Komitees zur Pflege freundschaftlicher Beziehungen zwischen Großbritannien und Deutschland) and later secretary to the World Christian Student League for social work and foreign mission (Christlichen Studentenweltbundes für Sozialarbeit und Ausländermission). In 1911 he and his wife founded the \\"Soziale Arbeitergemeinschaft Berlin-Ost\\" (SAG) - its offices were shut down after the Nazi seizure of power. At the World Churches Conference in Konstanz from 1 to 3 August 1914, just before the outbreak of war, he was secretary and co-founder of the \\"Weltbundes für Freundschaftsarbeit der Kirchen\\" and formed a pact with his fellow-delegate English Quaker Henry Hodgkin (meeting on the platform of the railway station at Cologne, they pledged to each other that, \\"We are one in Christ and can never be at war\\") that led to the formation of the Fellowship of Reconciliation and the International Fellowship of Reconciliation. During the First World War he organised Gefangenenseelsorge for British and German prisoners of war. Through his contacts with the Quakers and with the \\"Versöhnungsbund\\" (reconciliation alliance), he and Elisabeth Rotten organised Quaker meals for schoolchildren in Berlin. In 1915 he met the Dutch pacifist Kees Boeke in Berlin. October 1918 the founder of ecumenism, archbishop Nathan Söderblom, invited him to give a guest lecture on \\"The social renewal of Christianity and the unity of the Church\\"at Uppsala University. In 1925 Siegmund-Schultze received the professorship in \\"Jugendkunde und Jugendwohlfahrt\\" (and later in \\"Sozialpädagogik und Sozialethik\\")at the University of Berlin. In spring 1933 he joined the foundation of an international aid-committee for German-Jewish refugees. The Nazis arrested him (on 93 charges of \\"racial help\\") and expelled from Germany under Gestapobegleitung 1933 with his wife and four children. They went to live in Switzerland and he was active there in student chaplaincy and as a guest lecturer until 1946. In 1947 he was made professor of \\"Sozialpädagogik und Sozialethik\\" at the Westfälischen Wilhelms-Universitat at Münster. In 1948 he founded the \\"Jugend-Wohlfahrtsschule Dortmund\\", and was its head until 1954.

Ocean Grove, also known as Tomahawk and Toma haka in Te Reo Maori, is a suburb in the southeast of the New Zealand city of Dunedin. A semi-rural residential suburb on the Pacific coast at the southwestern end of the Otago Peninsula, Ocean Grove is located southeast of Dunedin city centre. The suburb is isolated from much of the city by the bluff of Lawyer's Head, which rises immediately to the west of the suburb and the Andersons Bay Cemetery, and as such has the feel of a separate community. The suburb lies close to the banks of the Tomahawk Lagoon, a twin- lobed lagoon noted for its bird life. The inner lobe is a wildlife reserve.Herd, J. and Griffiths, G.J. (1980) Discovering Dunedin. Dunedin: John McIndoe. . Tomahawk Lagoon is separated from the sea at low tide by Tomahawk Beach, which runs east from the Lagoon's mouth for about . A smaller beach, Smaills Beach, lies further to the east, beyond which is the outcrop of Maori Head, from the lagoon's mouth. A rocky reef and the small Bird island lie close to the headland. The suburb was known as Tomahawk until the 1930s,Hamel, A. (2007) Dunedin tracks and trails. Dunedin: Silver Peaks Press. . The name \\"Tomahawk\\", documented in the Otago Witness from 1852, is unlikely to be a reference to the weapon. It is more likely an anglicized form of the Māori words toma haka, often interpreted as \\"dance by a gravesite\\". Toma means a place of bones, or shrine for bones; haka is here taken to mean the Māori dance of challenge, but may rather be the Southern Māori form of the word hanga, to build or create. The suburb became part of Dunedin City in 1968. The suburb has one main road, Tomahawk Road, which runs roughly parallel with the coast and links with the suburbs of Andersons Bay and Tainui in the west. In the east, it becomes the rural Centre Road, which climbs to the ridge at the centre of the Otago peninsula before joining with Highcliff Road, the ridge road which runs between Shiel Hill and Portobello. Ocean Grove's most notable structures are the remains of two World War II gun emplacements. These stand close to the Jack Fox Lookout, which is at the top of the promontory which separates Tomahawk Beach from Smaills Beach. A notable two-storey house, Glen Cairn, the original Smaill family homestead, is located at Smaills Beach. It is now used as the headquarters of the Tautuku Fishing Club.

It is located to the southwest of Port Chalmers in a wide valley on the shore of Mussel Bay, to the northeast of Dunedin city centre. The suburb, on the western shore of Otago Harbour, lies between the two rocky headlands of Port Chalmers in the east and Roseneath in the west. The South Island Main Trunk rail line and State Highway 88 run along the shore of the bay. The name of the suburb is indicative of the occupation of many of its early settlers; the Sawyers Bay area provided much of the timber used in the early construction industry around both Dunedin and Port Chalmers area. Little remains of Sawyers Bay's early industries; it is now largely a residential suburb. Sawyers Bay's residential area is situated around one long street which runs inland from the bay itself. This street is called Station Road at its coastal end, and Hall Road further inland. At the coastal end, it connects with State Highway 88, the highway which runs along the west coast of Otago Harbour from Port Chalmers to Dunedin via Saint Leonards and Ravensbourne. Inland from here, roads branch off the main road – the most important of these is Stevenson Avenue, which connects with a back road to Port Chalmers (Borlases Road) in the east, and with Upper Junction Road in the west. Upper Junction Road, the winding old road to Port Chalmers from the Dunedin suburb of North East Valley, rises to join with the old Mount Cargill road, which was itself the former main road north out of Dunedin, linking the city's main urban area at Normanby with Waitati.

By the 1890s, most of the subdivisions of Opoho Township were occupied and Maybank was growing. Grandview was developed during the 1920s.Blair, E.W., and Kerse, E. (1988) On the slopes of Signal Hill. Dunedin:Otago Heritage Books. , pp.19-20, 39-42 Other township names occasionally encountered include St James' Park, a small area including Grey Street and James Streets on the lower slopes between Opoho and North East Valley. The suburb of Opoho has numerous prominent landmarks, most prominently the Dunedin Botanic Garden and Centennial Monument (see Signal Hill, New Zealand). Other landmarks of note include the Northern Cemetery, which occupies a low spur of Signal Hill on Lovelock Avenue, next to the Botanic Gardens and above Logan Park. One of Dunedin's earliest cemeteries (begun in 1872), many of Dunedin's notable early citizens are buried here, among them William Larnach and Thomas Bracken. Larnach's Gothic mausoleum is the most prominent structure in the cemetery, which commands impressive views across central Dunedin. Also of note are two university halls of residence which lie close to the southern end of Opoho. Knox College is a prominent towered red brick building on the lower slopes. Established as a theological hall in 1907, Knox is still a centre of the University of Otago's religious studies courses. Below this hall, close to the Gardens Corner, lies the smaller Salmond College, built in 1971. Also of note within the suburb is the Dunedin branch of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which has its headquarters in the suburb, and Tannock Glen, a public gardens which is notable for its rhododendrons. Sports clubs based in the suburb include the Alhambra Union Rugby Club, based at Opoho Park near the junction of Opoho Road and Lovelock Avenue. Numerous walking tracks cross the Botanic Gardens, Signal Hill, and the slopes between. These include a track across the summit of Signal Hill to link up with Cleghorn Street above the northern end of North East Valley, and tracks connecting the Centennial Memorial with Logan Park and the harbourside suburb of Ravensbourne.Hamel, A. (2008) Dunedin tracks and trails. Dunedin: Silver Peaks Press. , pp. 2.10-2.13 Noted Opoho residents have included artist Arthur Merric Boyd, athlete Jack Lovelock, celebrity chef Alison Holst, opera singer Patricia Payne and former All Black Kees Meeuws.

Maori Hill is a residential suburb of the New Zealand city of Dunedin. It is located at the northern end of the ridge which runs in a crescent around the central city's western edge, to the northwest of the city centre, immediately above and within the Town Belt. It is connected to Dunedin North, which lies to the east, via Drivers Road, the suburbs of Roslyn and Kaikorai to the southwest via Highgate, and the suburb of Wakari to the northwest via Balmacewen Road. Maori Hill's 2001 population was 1,956. In the northeast of the suburb lies the recreational ground of Prospect Park, and this part of Maori Hill is also often known by this name. From Prospect Park, views across the lower Leith Valley can be obtained, as the park sits close to the edge of cliffs which rise above the broad canyon at Woodhaugh. A steep walking track, the Bullock Track, links the two suburbs. Maori Hill is regarded as one of the city's wealthier and more exclusive suburbs, and contains many fine houses, especially in the maze of winding streets which run through the bush-clad slopes of the Town Belt. These houses include the historic manor Olveston, which has been owned by the city and open to the public since the 1960s. Unlike neighbouring hill suburbs like Roslyn, Maori Hill was not served by a cable car, possibly underlying its greater degree of exclusivity. Notable features of Maori Hill include the Balmacewen Golf Course, home of the Otago Golf Club, in the suburb's northwest. This is one of New Zealand's oldest and finest courses. A state integrated Presbyterian boys' secondary school, John McGlashan College, is located close to the golf course. To the southeast of the course lies a recreation ground, Bishopscourt, and nearby is Balmacewen Intermediate School. As with Prospect Park, this area is often referred to as a separate suburb, Balmacewen. To the northwest of the golf course is an area of scenic reserve which surrounds the Ross Creek Reservoir in Glenleith. Several popular walking tracks lead down to the reservoir from Cannington Road, which marks the northern edge of Maori Hill. Other schools in Maori Hill include Maori Hill School, a state primary school. On the Roslyn/Kaikorai/Maori Hill border is Columba College, a state integrated Presbyterian girls secondary school, with a coeducational Junior (primary) school. Maori Hill contains the city's largest private hospitals. Formerly known as the Mater Misericordiae, it is now the Mercy Hospital, and contains as part of its complex the Marinoto Clinic. This is located on Newington Avenue, one of several streets which wind down into the Town Belt from Highgate. The hospital is built around Marinoto, the former home of the Sargood family and now one of the hospital's major buildings.

The suburb is named after Calton Hill in Edinburgh, Scotland, and some of its street names carry similar etymological roots. It covers an area of approximately and has 627 households comprising 1583 residents. The suburb was established in the 1900s, as part of the second wave of suburban development in Dunedin. The parent suburb is Caversham, one of Dunedin's (and New Zealand's) oldest suburbs, established two generations prior as part of the first wave of settlement of the area. During the first wave of settlement before Calton Hill was established, it is unclear what modern day Calton Hill was called; possibilities include Caversham Hills or, more informally, John Sidey's farm. Calton Hill is the geographical area bounded by the Dunedin Southern Motorway to the north and the Caversham Valley Forest Reserve beyond; farmland in the south and west that borders Concord and the Burnside industrial area; and an arbitrary eastern border of Corstorphine Road, Sidey Street, Cole Street and South Road (where it terminates near the Dunedin Southern Motorway). The South Island Main Trunk railway and the motorway (part of State Highway 1) further distinguish its northern border. For many of those on the northern and eastern slopes, Calton Hill has views to Mt Cargill (Kapukataumahaka) and Flagstaff (Te Whanaupaki) in the north and the Pacific Ocean in the south-east. To the east, Calton Hill looks over the central plains of Dunedin city with Signal Hill (Te Pahuri o te Rangipohika), the Otago Harbour and Otago Peninsula in the distance. For those on the western slopes, the Kaikorai Valley and Green Island are in immediate view with Saddle Hill and the Taieri Plains beyond.  Geography  The heart of Dunedin City is a central plain surrounded by hills, the remnants of a long- extinct volcano. Calton Hill lies around 6 km to the southwest of the city centre (The Octagon); line of sight with Calton Hill from the Octagon is obscured by a large hill spur heading east from the main ridge line that forms the western edge of central Dunedin. Looking up and to the west from the southern end of Dunedin's central plain, Calton Hill is the most northern prominence. Calton Hill has a crowning northerly ridge with two high points, bookended by the upper section of Corstorphine Valley in the south and Lookout Point saddle in the north. Two north-northeast running spurs and slopes drop down from this ridge into the upper reaches of the Caversham Valley. Between these two spurs lies a north-facing bowl,. To the southwest, the hill's slopes meet farmland bordering Burnside and Concord. The majority of the suburb is between 60 and 130 m above sea level. = Surrounding areas = Calton Hill shares its immediate borders with suburbs of Corstorphine, Concord and Burnside (separated by farmland), and Caversham and Maryhill (separated by partially forested, partially populated south facing hill slopes of the Caversham Valley). Calton Hill also shares borders with the small suburb of Lookout Point to the north. The 3.4-hectare (8.4-acre) Caversham Forest Reserve is located as part of this area. Purchased by the Dunedin City Council in 1994 with the assistance of the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society, it is home to various native bird and invertebrate species, including one species of velvet worm believed to be endemic to the Dunedin area. Residential areas in New Zealand are often not clearly defined, and suburban boundaries often overlap and change depending on subjective understandings. It is unclear whether residents within the geographical area of Calton Hill identify with Calton Hill as the community they belong to, or Lookout Point, Caversham, or Corstophine.  History  Prior to the arrival of humans to New Zealand, the area of Calton Hill was likely clothed in a dense and highly diverse mixed podocarp/broadleaf forest. Soil consisted largely of windblown loess over a weathered bedrock of sandstone covered by the Dunedin Volcanic Complex metamorphic processes. = Pre-colonial history = Approximately 800 years ago, Māori arrived on these islands. During the pre-colonial period mana whenua (territorial rights) over the Calton Hill area were held by three indigenous iwi (tribes), though there is no known archaeological evidence that shows direct residential occupation of Calton Hill itself. By the 19th century, two of these three iwi (Kāti Māmoe and Waitaha) had largely been subsumed by the largest, Kāi Tahu. The Calton Hill/Caversham Valley area was likely used as a thoroughfare south alongside coastal transportation provided by waka hourua (double hulled sailing canoes). Various areas may have been sites for nohoanga (temporary food gathering camps), gathering potable water, mahinga kai (food gathering area) for aruhe (bracken root) and ti kouka (Cabbage Tree), and for collecting other useful materials and resources. There are only two surviving place names of the area to suggest it was an important area to the Māori. The bordering saddle of Lookout Point was named Koranga-a- runga-te-raki after Kāti Māmoe late 18th century chief Te Raki Ihia, who was largely responsible for joining the Kāi Tahu and Kãti Māmoe iwi together. He was buried here so that \\"his spirit might see hence his old haunts to the southward.\\" The ridge-line which runs from St Clair Beach to the Lookout Point saddle is known as Whakaherekau (possibly meaning \\"to make a conciliatory present\\"). This latter name may have been used by tangata whenua to name the entire area. = European colonisation = At the time of the Treaty of Waitangi being negotiated and signed in January and February 1840, Calton Hill was probably by then a mosaic of tussock grassland and bracken shrubland with pockets of podocarp and broadleaf forest in steep gullies. Botanical records indicate the Calton Hill area that once was covered in dense podocarp, broadleaf forest had been displaced by human-lit fires. In the years prior to this it is unlikely the area would have been used by the small number of Europeans who inhabited the country. From 1844 to 1863 Ngāi Tahu sold their lands to the Crown in a series of nine purchases. Calton Hill was 200 acres of a total of 400,000 acres (160,000 ha) that made up the Otago Purchase, completed on 31 July 1844. The Crown reimbursed just £2,400 to local chiefs. In 1848, the first colonist ships arrived in the Dunedin area. In 1855 John Sidey purchased a large area of land stretching from the Caversham Hills (modern day Corstophine, Calton Hill) to Mount Grand/ Kaikorai Hill 4km away above Kaikorai Valley. With the exception of steep, inaccessible gully areas, most other area would have been cleared, sown with exotic grass species, and fenced for cattle farming. A small number trees may have been harvested for building products and firewood. During this time, there was a non-shingled road that skirted the northern edge of Calton Hill and up the Caversham Valley and over the Lookout Point saddle. In 1861, gold was discovered in Central Otago. Whilst hundreds of kilometres away, the northern edge of modern-day Calton Hill was a short stretch of the primary goldrush highway. Thousands of people began trekking past with their swags following the Caversham Valley as the only road south to the diggings of the Central Otago Gold Rush. John Sidey would supply the miners with meat from his farm and other carted supplies. Now, the area has two railway lines that have been tunnelled through the sandstone beneath. One is no longer open for transport; the other remains part of the main south trunk line. The first tunnel was established in December 1873. The second completed in 1910, the tunnels provided a transport link to and from the city and other urban areas of Dunedin until the 1960s. The Caversham railway station, only 10 to 15 minutes walk from any part of Calton Hill, was the nearest station. In addition to the railway line, between 1880 and 1940, residents could also use the Dunedin cable tramway system. The nearest station was also at Caversham. =The twentieth century= The first published mention of the existence of Calton Hill is from 1907. The farmland was surveyed for the establishment of roads, related infrastructure and residential sections. The \\"Township of Calton Hill\\" was formally gazetted by the City of Dunedin 19 November 1907 with advertisements appearing in newspapers for \\"choice sections, view and sun, low prices\\". Bare land remained for much of the sections until the first houses were built immediately prior to World War I, with remaining farmland tendered for grazing. A concentrated phase of building occurred during the 1950s and 1960s, completed through the Government's state housing scheme established 15–20 years previous. Mass public transport was being replaced by mass private transport; garages were retrofitted on older houses to store cars and the suburb's population increased. Riselaw Road School was established in 1953 along with a community hall, play centre, and other facilities for children and families on the adjacent Riselaw Road site.  Demographics  As at the 2013 NZ census, there were 1583 residents living in the suburb of Calton Hill, with 627 households located on the area's 16 streets, roads and avenues. The median age was 30.5 years of age and the median income was $23,800 per annum. A high proportion of Calton Hill residents are of low socio-economic status compared to those of other suburbs of Dunedin, with a significant proportion of the 627 households being in the Riselaw Road state-owned housing areas built during the 1950s and 1960s. Originally Riselaw Road School was a hub for the community. Now, the local primary school has been amalgamated and renamed as Carisbrook School Heights Site. It has two classes on its roll. In 2020 it is now Southern Health School. Adjacent to the school is the Riselaw Road Playcentre. Other community facilities include two public bus services, Calton Hill Community Hall, the Dunedin Public Library Book bus (which visits the suburb once a week), two children's playground areas, sports fields alongside the school, and other public infrastructure typical of a New Zealand suburb (street lights, curb and channel drainage etc.). Potential public recreation areas lie to the north with a forest reserve, and to the south with under utilised sports grounds and bordering farmland. The nearest secondary schools are Queen's High School and King's High School located in Forbury, 2–3 km to the south on the boundary between South Dunedin and St Kilda. The closest commercial/retail area is in South Road, Caversham. Residents are serviced by two retail food businesses on opposite ends of Riselaw Road. There are a few home-based businesses, but the area is primarily residential.  Governance  Calton Hill falls within Dunedin City and as such is under the governance of Dunedin City Council and the Otago Regional Council. The area is not represented by any of Dunedin's six community boards, but is solely part of the greater area of the City of Dunedin. Health issues are under the management of the Southern District Health Board. Indigenous governance of Calton Hill falls within the takiwa of the Otakou Runaka, one of the 18 hapu of the Kai Tahu iwi. Since 2009, Tahu Potiki has been the appointed representative for the Otakou Runaka. Nationally, Calton Hill falls within the Dunedin South electorate. As of 2014, the MP for Dunedin South is Clare Curran (Labour). Calton Hill is also part of Te Tai Tonga electorate, one of the country's seven Māori seats. As of 2014, the MP for Te Tai Tonga is Rino Tirikatene. References Suburbs of Dunedin ","title":"Calton Hill, New Zealand"},{"id":"18566084","text":"F.

He distinguished himself and became one of the main commanders during the popular uprising against the Italians in Montenegro in July 1941, but later collaborated with the Italians in actions against the Communist-led Yugoslav Partisans. In 1943, his troops carried out several massacres against the Muslim population of Bosnia, Herzegovina and the Sandžak, and participated in the anti-Partisan Case White offensive alongside Italian forces. Đurišić was captured by the Germans in May 1943, escaped and was recaptured. After the capitulation of Italy, the Germans released Đurišić and he began collaborating with them and the Serbian puppet government. In 1944, he created the Montenegrin Volunteer Corps with assistance from the Germans, the leader of the Serbian puppet government, Milan Nedić, and the leader of the fascist Yugoslav National Movement, Dimitrije Ljotić. In late 1944, the German commander in Montenegro decorated him with the Iron Cross 2nd Class. Đurišić was killed following the Battle of Lijevče Field, after being captured by elements of the Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia near Banja Luka in an apparent trap set by them and Montenegrin separatist Sekula Drljević. Some of Đurišić's troops were killed either in this battle or in later attacks by the Partisans as they then continued their withdrawal west. Others attempted to withdraw to Austria; they were forced to surrender to the Partisans and were killed in the Kočevski Rog area of southern Slovenia in May and June 1945. Đurišić was a very able Chetnik leader; his fighting skills were respected by his allies and opponents alike.  Early life  Pavle Đurišić was born on 9 July 1909 in Podgorica, Principality of Montenegro, where he was raised until the death of his father Ilija. His mother was Ivana ( Radović, from the Brnović clan. According to some sources he was born in 1907. Đurišić was educated up to lower secondary school. Following his father's death, he moved to Berane, where he lived with his uncle Petar Radović, a judge and former Chetnik who had been a member of the band of Vuk Popović during the Macedonian Struggle. Đurišić attended a teacher training college in Berane for almost two years. In 1927, Đurišić entered the 55th class of the Military Academy; he was commissioned as an infantry potporučnik (second lieutenant) in the Royal Yugoslav Army (, VKJ) in 1930. He began his service in Sarajevo with the 10th Infantry Regiment Takovska and attended infantry officers' school. Đurišić remained in Sarajevo until 1934 when, upon his own request, he was transferred to Berane where he served first as a platoon commander and later as a commander of the 1st Company of the 48th Infantry Regiment. Đurišić had a daughter named Ljiljana, who was born in 1937 but died in 1943. On 7 April 1939, after the Italian invasion of Albania, Đurišić's company was sent to Plav near the Albanian border to gather intelligence. He established contact with individuals in the Italian protectorate of Albania and obtained intelligence, but the information he obtained was not very useful for the defence of Yugoslavia and he returned to Berane with his company. Contacts Đurišić made during this period would become important a few years later. Đurišić's son Ilija was born in 1940.  World War II = Axis invasion and Italian occupation of Montenegro = In April 1941, Germany, Italy and Hungary invaded and occupied Yugoslavia. Montenegro was captured by the Germans, who soon withdrew, leaving the Italians to occupy it. The Montenegrins quickly developed grievances against the Italians related to the expulsion of Montenegrins from Kosovo and Vojvodina, the influx of refugees from other parts of Yugoslavia, and those fleeing Ustaše terror in the regions along the borders with Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Montenegrins also had grievances against the Italian annexation of important food producing territory in Kosovo and a salt producing facility at Ulcinj to Albania, and the economic damage inflicted on many Montenegrins by the temporary removal of Yugoslav banknotes of 500 dinars and above from circulation. By the time of the invasion, Đurišić had been promoted to the rank of kapetan prve klase (captain first class).  Uprising in Montenegro  In mid-July 1941, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (, KPJ) in Italian-occupied Montenegro initiated a general uprising against the Italians. The uprising was triggered by the proclamation of a restored Kingdom of Montenegro headed by an Italian regent and led by the Montenegrin separatist Sekula Drljević and his supporters, known as \\"Greens\\" (zelenaši). The insurgents also included large numbers of Montenegrin Serb nationalists known as \\"Whites\\" (bjelaši), who \\"stood for close ties to Serbia\\". About 400 former VKJ officers, many of whom were willing to work with the communists, also took part. Some of the officers had recently been released from prisoner-of-war camps by the Germans and Italians, having been captured during the invasion. The VKJ officers assumed command, while the KPJ organised the revolt and provided political commissars. When the uprising commenced, Đurišić joined the committee that had been organised to lead military operations in the Berane district. In the early phase of the uprising the rebels seized control of small towns and villages. Đurišić fought alongside communist insurgents, and led a successful attack on Berane. During the heaviest fighting he distinguished himself, and emerged as one of the main commanders of the uprising. After nearly two days of house-to-house fighting to capture Berane, he was involved in negotiating the surrender of the surviving Italian troops. Following the Italian surrender, he objected to the instructions he received from the communists regarding the handling of Italian prisoners. During the uprising, Đurišić also led fighting against Drljević's forces. Following the Italians' removal from the Lim valley, Đurišić urged rebels to march on Rožaje and Kosovska Mitrovica and attack the Muslims and Albanians there, whom he considered \\"anational\\". The leaders of the uprising made it clear they considered such an action unacceptable. The other main commanders of the uprising included the former VKJ officers Colonel Bajo Stanišić and Major Đorđije Lašić. Within six weeks, a force of 67,000 Italian troops, assisted by Muslim and Albanian irregulars from border areas who provided flank security, regained control of all towns and communication routes in Montenegro. General Alessandro Pirzio Biroli, the Italian military governor of Montenegro, issued orders to crush the revolt but directed his forces to avoid \\"acts of revenge and useless cruelty\\". Nevertheless, dozens of villages were burned, hundreds were killed, and between 10,000 and 20,000 inhabitants were interned during the suppression of the revolt. For a while, the Muslim and Albanian irregulars were permitted to pillage and torch villages. As soon as the Italians launched their offensive, politicians in Berane abandoned their support for the uprising and began criticising it. Former VKJ officers deserted their units and Đurišić left the military committee organising the uprising in the Berane district. The politicians and officers formed their own committees and approached the Italians to express their loyalty and denounce the communists. A division developed between the uprising's communist leadership and the nationalists who were participating. The nationalists recognised the uprising had been crushed and wanted to stop fighting, while the communists were determined to continue the struggle. In late 1941, the nationalists contacted the Italians and offered to help them fight the communists, who had since been renamed Partisans. The nationalistsincluding Đurišić, who was popular in his own Vasojević clan of northern Montenegrosubsequently withdrew into the hinterland. They sought to avoid provoking the Italians and protect the mountain villages if they were attacked. In northern Montenegro, there was a marked distinction between the communists and nationalists. The nationalists had closer ties with Serbia and exhibited a \\"frontier\\" mentality towards Muslims. The communists wished to continue the uprising by turning against their class enemies. Ustaše manipulation of the Muslims in the Sandžak and the expulsion of Serbs from areas annexed by Albania made Đurišić and his Chetniks impatient to attack Muslims and Albanians. They subsequently turned on the Muslims and Albanians in the region. The uprising continued with reduced intensity until December 1941. In 1941, Đurišić was awarded the Order of Karađorđe's Star by the Yugoslav government-in-exile on the recommendation of Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović.  Mihailović's instructions  In October 1941, Mihailović appointed Đurišić as his commander for all regular and reserve troops in central and eastern Montenegro and parts of the Sandžak. In early November, the nationalist leaders in Montenegro quickly became aware of the split between the Chetniks and Partisans in Serbia; later that month they sent Đurišić to visit Mihailović. During this visit, Đurišić received verbal orders from Mihailović and was appointed as the commander of all Chetnik detachments in the Sandžak. Lašić was appointed commander of all Chetnik forces in Old Montenegro. Đurišić's appointment was also included as part of instructions dated 20 December 1941 that were received from Mihailović. The instructions included the following objectives: These instructions stated that the objectives of the Partisans meant that there could be no cooperation between them and the Chetniks. They also appointed Đurišić as a Chetnik vojvoda. Some historians have challenged the authenticity of these instructions; they say the document was a forgery made by Đurišić after he failed to reach Mihailović. Other historians either do not mention any controversy about the provenance of the instructions, mention evidence supporting their authenticity, or explicitly state they consider them to be authentic.  Collaboration with the Italians against the Partisans in Montenegro  Pirzio Biroli, Italian governor of Montenegro In January 1942, Đurišić met with representatives of Generale di brigata (Brigadier) Silvio Bonini, the commander of the Italian 19th Infantry Division Venezia. Đurišić's brother Vaso was responsible for liaising with the Italian division and was stationed at their headquarters in Berane. At this meeting, Đurišić was granted freedom of action against the Partisans in the division's area of responsibility; an agreement between Đurišić and the Italian representatives was signed by Vaso on Đurišić's behalf. That March, Đurišić again met with the staff of the division. In the same month, he assembled a group of former VKJ officers, politicians and other non-communists, and passed on Mihailović's instructions. Mihailović codenamed Đurišić's headquarters \\"Mountain Staff No. 15\\"; Đurišić selected the village of Zaostro for its location. In January, a Chetnik force led by Lašić conducted successful operations against the Partisans in the Andrijevica district, but Lašić suffered a severe head wound during the fighting. Lašić's wounding meant Đurišić soon became the most prominent and important Chetnik commander in Montenegro. By 5 January, Đurišić assumed command over the Berane district and established seven Chetnik detachments in the area. Soon after, a district political committee with responsibility for organising propaganda and finding recruits was formed. Đurišić soon gained control of all anti-communist militia groups in the Berane district, totalling 500 men, and two smaller groups from Kolašin and Bijelo Polje totalling 120 men. On 13 January, after a week of preparation, he launched attacks on two Partisan battalions operating in the Berane district. After four days of fighting, Đurišić succeeded in almost completely clearing the district of Partisans with the help of Italian troops and Muslim militias. By 24 January, Đurišić's forces captured the remaining Partisan-held village in the district, killing 15 Partisans and executing 27 who had been captured. This effectively eliminated the remaining Partisan presence in Berane. By March, Đurišić had demonstrated to the Italians that he was uncompromising towards the Partisans and his detachments were expanding beyond the division's area of responsibility. An agreement was negotiated between Đurišić and General Biroli, the military governor and commander of Italian troops in Montenegro. This agreement, signed by Đurišić, also related to the area of operations of the 19th Infantry Division Venezia. The Italians agreed to supply Đurišić and his troops with arms, food, and wages. The agreement obliged Đurišić to: * lead the fight against the communists and their supporters; * maintain contact with the Italian military authorities, so that his actions were carried out in accordance with Italian instructions. North of Lijeva Rijeka, Đurišić agreed to clear his actions with Bonini, and south of Lijeva Rijeka he was to coordinate with Biroli; * maintain order and guarantee the safety of roads in his area of operations; * never attack Italian troops and limit his activities to fighting against the communists; * return all arms provided by the Italians, except for those needed to maintain order, after the destruction of the communists. Despite his possession of Mihailović's instructions, Đurišić initially had minimal influence on the non-communist elements of the Montenegrin resistance and was unable to develop an effective strategy against the Italians or Partisans in the months after his return to Montenegro. In early 1942, his Chetnik detachment became more active against local Muslims, especially in eastern Montenegro and the Sandžak. The Partisans occupied Kolašin in January and February 1942, and turned against all real and potential opposition; they killed about 300 people and threw their corpses into pits they called the \\"dogs' cemetery\\". Because of this and other examples of communist terror, some Montenegrins turned against the Partisans. On 23 February, Đurišić captured Kolašin and held it as a Chetnik bastion until May 1943. Chetnik terror against political opponents intensified following Đurišić's capture of Kolašin on 23 February. Captured Partisans and sympathisers were typically killed on the spot, including 17 wounded Partisans captured in the village of Lipovo. Show trials were staged in March and April for some of the town's prominent citizens, whom the Chetniks considered opponents, and many known or suspected communists were sentenced to death and executed. Đurišić established a Chetnik prison in Kolašin, in which 2,000 people were incarcerated and tortured. At least 74 prisoners were shot at Breza near Kolašin. In late April 1943, 313 inmates of Kolašin Chetnik prison were handed to Italians; 27 of these were executed during an Italian mass execution of 180 hostages on 25 June 1943. In May 1942, Đurišić attacked and defeated the last significant Partisan detachment in Montenegro. In June 1942, Đurišić collaborated with the Ustaše in Foča in south-eastern Bosnia. After being forced out of Serbia by the Germans, Mihailović arrived in Montenegro as the Italians and Chetniks were fighting the Partisans. Mihailović was accompanied by his staff and a British Special Operations Executive (SOE) liaison officer. He eventually established his base in the village of Gornje Lipovo, a few miles from Đurišić's headquarters at Kolašin. Mihailović and his staff had few troops and relied on Đurišić for protection. Soon after Mihailović arrived in Montenegro, Đurišić told Mihailović's SOE liaison officer that he was available to act independently and in defiance of Mihailović. Đurišić and the other Chetnik commanders in Montenegro nominally recognised Mihailović as their supreme commander but they rarely obeyed him. On 24 July 1942, Blažo Đukanović, senior commander of all Chetnik forces in Montenegro, signed a comprehensive agreement with Biroli which officially organised and recognised three Chetnik \\"flying detachments\\" as Italian auxiliary troops for use against the Partisans. These detachments were supplied, armed, and paid by the Italians; they included 4,500 Chetniks, 1,500 of whom were under the command of Đurišić. The Chetniks became an important part of the Italian occupation regime in Montenegro. The existing \\"Montenegrin Chetnik committee\\", which was led by the Brigadier General Đukanović and to which Đurišić was aligned, was recognised by the Italians as the \\"Nationalist Committee of Montenegro\\", whose only political aims were to combat the communists and others opposed to the Italian occupation, and \\"maintain law and order\\". Arrangements were to be made by mutual understanding for pay, rations, weaponry, and aid to the families of Chetniks. During the rest of 1942, Italian operations in conjunction with their Chetnik auxiliaries forced the remaining Partisans out of Montenegro, after which the Italians used the Chetnik auxiliaries to police the countryside. For most of this time, Đurišić operated fairly independently in northern Montenegro; he was described as \\"a law unto himself\\". In December 1942, Chetniks from Montenegro and the Sandžak met at a conference in the village of Šahovići near Bijelo Polje. The conference was dominated by Đurišić; its resolutions expressed extremism and intolerance, and its agenda focused on restoring the pre-war status quo in Yugoslavia implemented in its initial stages by a Chetnik dictatorship. It also laid claim to parts of the territory of Yugoslavia's neighbours. At this conference, Mihailović was represented by Major Zaharije Ostojić, his chief of staff, who had previously been encouraged by Mihailović to wage a campaign of terror against the Muslim population living along the borders of Montenegro and the Sandžak. One outcome of the conference was the decision to destroy the Muslim villages in the Čajniče district of Bosnia. = Case White and cleansing actions = Đurišić's report of 13 February 1943 informing Mihailović of the massacres of Muslims in the counties of Čajniče and Foča in southeastern Bosnia and in the county of Pljevlja in the Sandžak. In December 1942, concerned about the possibility of Allied forces landing in the Balkans, the Germans began planning an anti-Partisan offensive in Bosnia and Herzegovina codenamed \\"Case White\\". The size of the planned offensive required the involvement of both the Croatian Home Guard and the Italians. Late in the planning, the Italians began to prepare and equip Chetnik detachments, including that of Đurišić, for involvement in the operation. In early January 1943, the Chetnik Supreme Command ordered Montenegrin Chetnik units to carry out \\"cleansing actions\\" against Muslims in Bijelo Polje county in north- eastern Montenegro. On 10 January 1943, Đurišić reported that Chetniks under his command had burned down 33 Muslim villages, killed 400 Muslim fightersmembers of the Muslim self-protection militia also supported by the Italiansand had also killed about 1,000 Muslim women and children. As Italian auxiliaries, Đurišić's detachment was so dependent on the Italians for arms and transport that it had not left Montenegro until 18 January 1943, two days before the first phase of Case White was to begin. On 3 January 1943, Ostojić issued orders to \\"cleanse\\" the Čajniče district of Ustaše–Muslim organisations. According to the historian Radoje Pajović, Ostojić produced a detailed plan that avoided specifying what was to be done with the district's Muslim population. Instead, these instructions were to be given orally to the responsible commanders. Delays in the movement of Chetnik forces into Bosnia to participate in Case White alongside the Italians enabled the Chetnik Supreme Command to expand the planned \\"cleansing\\" operation to include the Pljevlja district in the Sandžak and the Foča district of Bosnia. A combined Chetnik force of 6,000 divided into four detachments and commanded by Vojislav Lukačević, Andrija Vesković, Zdravko Kasalović and Bajo Nikić was assembled. Mihailović ordered all four detachments to be placed under the overall command of Đurišić. In early February 1943, during their advance north-west into Herzegovina in preparation for their involvement in Case White, the combined Chetnik force killed large numbers of Muslims in the area of Pljevlja, Foča and Čajniče. In a report to Mihailović dated 13 February 1943, Đurišić wrote that his Chetniks had killed about 1,200 Muslim combatants and about 8,000 women, children and the elderly, and destroyed all property except livestock, grain and hay, which they seized.Goran Marković; (2014) Četnici i antifašizam (Chetniks and anti-fascism, in Serbian) p. 182; Hereticus Časopis za preispitivanje proslosti Vol. XII, No. l-2; Đurišić reported that: About 500 Muslims, mostly women, children and the elderly, were killed in Goražde in March, and several women were raped. An estimated 10,000 people were killed in the anti-Muslim operations commanded by Đurišić between January and February 1943. The casualty rate would have been higher if many Muslims had not already fled the areamost to Sarajevowhen the February action began. Chetnik casualties during the operations were reported as 36 killed and 58 wounded. The orders for the \\"cleansing\\" operation stated that the Chetniks should kill all Muslim fighters, communists and Ustaše, but that they should not kill women and children. According to Pajović, these instructions were included to ensure there was no written evidence for the killing of non-combatants. On 8 February, one Chetnik commander made a notation on his copy of written orders issued by Đurišić that the detachments had received additional orders to kill all Muslims they encountered. On 10 February, the commander of the Pljevlja Chetnik Brigade told one of his battalion commanders that he was to kill everyone in accordance with the orders of their highest commanders. According to Tomasevich, despite Chetnik claims that this and previous \\"cleansing actions\\" were countermeasures against aggressive Muslim activities, all circumstances point to it being Đurišić's partial achievement of Mihailović's previous directive to clear the Sandžak of Muslims. By the end of February 1943, Đurišić's Chetniks were resisting Partisan attempts to move east from the Neretva river. After the Battle of Neretva, during which the Partisans forced a crossing of the river against faltering Chetnik opposition, Đurišić's detachment of about 2,000 fighters fell back to Kalinovik, where they were almost defeated by the Partisan 2nd Proletarian Division in late March. Falling back further towards the Drina river, Đurišić had assembled about 4,500 Bosnian and Montenegrin Chetniks around Foča by April but was in desperate need of supplies. Shortly after this, the Italians withdrew most of their troops from Foča and abandoned most of the Sandžak. For the rest of April 1943, Đurišić fought a holding action against the Partisans along the Drina river with his 3,000 remaining fighters. =Capture= The Germans followed up Case White with a further offensive, codenamed \\"Case Black\\", whose objectives were the \\"disarming of all Chetniks and the destruction of all Partisans in Montenegro and Sandžak\\", to secure important bauxite, lead, and chromium mines. According to Tomasevich, the main reasons for the offensive were the threat of an Allied landing in the Balkans and the need to eliminate resistance groups that could assist the Allies. In early May 1943, the Germans entered the Sandžak and eastern Montenegro area. Đurišić withdrew to Kolašin with about 500 fighters and joined forces with Serbian Chetniks commanded by Dragutin Keserović. On 10 May 1943, Oberstleutnant (Lieutenant Colonel) Heinz, commander of the 4th Regiment of the Brandenburg Division, met Đurišić at Kolašin with the intent of engaging him to help the Germans against the Partisans. Đurišić said he was willing to do this, and once the Partisans were defeated he said he would be ready to fight alongside the Germans on the Russian Front. During the meeting, Đurišić told Heinz that Mihailović had left Kolašin at the end of 1942 and that he refused to accept Mihailović's current policy. Đurišić said Mihailović had been distracted by propaganda and was over-rated, and described him as \\"an unsteady visionary wandering through the land\\". Đurišić also said Josip Broz Tito and his Partisans were the only serious enemy. On 11 May 1943, Heinz submitted a proposal to General der Infanterie (Lieutenant General) Rudolf Lüters, the German Commanding General in Croatia, regarding the Chetniks who had been \\"legalised\\" by the Italians. He suggested the Germans also \\"legalise\\" Đurišić's Chetniks and use them to disarm \\"non-legalised\\" Chetniks groups. Heinz also proposed that after the Partisans had been destroyed, the Germans \\"legalise\\" only weak detachments of Đurišić's Chetniks. Subsequent events indicate Heinz's approach to Đurišić may not have been authorised by his superiors and that his suggestions were not acted upon. On 14 May 1943, a forward detachment of the German 1st Mountain Division entered Kolašin and seized Đurišić by deceiving the Italian troops who were guarding his headquarters. Đurišić and the Chetniks did not resist their capture and there were no casualties. The Italians vigorously protested Đurišić's capture but the Germans overruled them. With the capture of Đurišić's Chetniks and another Chetnik group west of Kolašin a few days later, Case Black became an almost entirely anti-Partisan operation. Đurišić was driven away in a vehicle carrying Red Cross markings; he was then flown from Berane to a prisoner-of-war camp at Stryi in the Lviv region of Galicia which formed part of the German occupation area of the General Government. He escaped three months later and was recaptured by the authorities of the Serbian puppet government in October 1943 while attempting to cross the Danube near Pančevo in southern Banat. He was handed over to the Germans and held in the Gestapo prison in Belgrade. = Release and return to Montenegro = In September 1943, the Italians capitulated and the Germans occupied Montenegro, establishing an area command ( 1040) under Generalmajor (Brigadier) Wilhem Keiper. Soon after, the German Special Envoy in Belgrade, Hermann Neubacher, along with the leader of the puppet government in the German-occupied territory of Serbia, Milan Nedić, and the German Military Commander in south- east Europe, General Hans Felber, arranged for Đurišić to be released. Neubacher had developed a plan to establish a union between Serbia and Montenegro, which he called a \\"Greater Serbian federation\\". He submitted it to Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop in October 1943. Đurišić was an important part of this plan. He was well regarded by the Chetniks and pro- Chetnik populace in Montenegro, and Stanišić and Đukanović had been killed on October 18, after Partisans launched offensive on their headquarters based in Ostrog monastery. Neubacher, Nedić and Felber believed Đurišić could be used to fight the Partisans in Montenegro and help form closer relations between Serbia and Montenegro. Although Neubacher's plan did not gain Hitler's approval, Đurišić received supplies including arms and ammunition from the Germans and in November 1943 he returned to Montenegro to fight against the Partisans. At this time he established closer ties with Dimitrije Ljotić, whose Serbian Volunteer Corps (SDK) provided him with weapons, food, typewriters, and other supplies. He also worked with Nedić, who promoted him to the rank of lieutenant colonel, and appointed him assistant to the commander of the SDK. According to Pajović, Đurišić was promoted in early to mid-1944 by the Yugoslav government-in-exile on the advice of Mihailović. =Collaboration with the Germans against the Partisans in Montenegro=Winter and spring of 1944 In February 1944, Nedić sent the 2nd Battalion of the 5th Regiment of the SDK to Montenegro to supplement Đurišić's forces. In the first half of 1944, the Germans in Montenegro and the Sandžak organised offensives against the Partisans, largely relying on forces under the command of Lašić and Đurišić. Because of the weakness of their own forces, the Germans contributed by commanding and supplying the troops involved, and providing smaller mobile armoured units with heavy weapons. The Chetnik leaders provided most of the troops. In February and March, the Germans and numerous Chetnik units undertook a series of operations codenamed Bora, Baumblüte and Vorfrühling around Podgorica. When the Partisan 2nd Proletarian and 5th Krajina divisions advanced into Serbia in March 1944, Partisan forces in northern Montenegro and the Sandžak were reduced to the 37th Sandžak Division. To exploit this weakness, Đurišić proposed to the Germans that they launch an offensive operation. Operation Frühlingserwachen was planned for the northern parts of Montenegro and the Sandžak; its primary objective was the capture of Kolašin through concentric attacks launched from Pljevlja, Prijepolje and Pešter. This would permit them to link up with forces advancing from Podgorica in the south and to drive a wedge through the middle of the Partisan lines. Operation Frühlingserwachen involved an Axis force of about 5,000 men comprising some of Đurišić's forces, the SS Polizei-Selbstschutz- Regiment Sandschak, the 2nd Battalion of the 5th Regiment of the SDK, and two reinforced German motorised companies. The operation began on 9 April; on 12 April they reached Bijelo Polje. Đurišić's forces seized Berane on 17 April, but the 37th Sandžak Division halted the advancing forces on the line of the Tara River at Mojkovac. On 24 April, after nine days of attacks and counter- attacks, the 37th Sandžak Division, reinforced by the 7th Montenegro Youth Brigade \\"Budo Tomović\\" of the 3rd Shock Division, regained the initiative. They retook Bijelo Polje on 30 April, and Berane on 5 May. This reversal consolidated the poor German–Chetnik position in Montenegro; their forces in the south were completely isolated from those in the north. Chetnik forces and their allies suffered heavy casualties; the 2nd Battalion of the 5th Regiment of the SDK was reduced from 893 men to 350. Summer 1944 In mid-May 1944, Đurišić visited Belgrade and asked Nedić, Neubacher, and Generalfeldmarschall (Field Marshal) Maximilian von Weichs, German Commander- in-Chief Southeast, to urgently send arms and other supplies to his unit, which was authorised to a strength of 5,000 men. Đurišićwith help from the Germans, Nedić, and Ljotićthen established the Montenegrin Volunteer Corps (, CDK), which was formally part of the SDK. The CDK consisted of some of Đurišić's former soldiers who had been released from German captivity, but most were Chetniks who had remained in Montenegro and were gathered under the umbrella term \\"national forces\\". By this time, although he still formally owed allegiance to Yugoslavia through Mihailović, he also owed some allegiance to the Germans and to Nedić, who had released, promoted, and supported him. The German 2nd Panzer Army organised Đurišić's troops into three regiments numbered 6th, 7th, and 8th, following the five regiments of the SDK. The CDK was subordinated to the headquarters of 2nd Panzer Army. Đurišić was appointed commander; his corps headquarters were in Prijepolje. The 6th Regiment, based in Prijepolje, was commanded by Captain Vuksan Cimbaljević and included Chetniks from the districts of Andrijevica and Berane. The 7th Regiment, headquartered in Pljevlja, was commanded by Captain Radoman Rajlić and consisted of Sandžak Chetniks. The 8th Regiment, based in Podgorica, was commanded by Captain Miloš Pavićević and consisted of Chetniks from Podgorica, Danilovgrad, and Nikšić. Each regiment was planned to consist of two \\"corps\\" of 800 men each. The CDK comprised between 7,000 and 8,000 men. Leutnant Heusz, a former German liaison officer for Lukačević, was assigned to watch Đurišić. On 30 May 1944, Heusz sent a detailed briefing to Đurišić instructing him to ensure that joint operations were progressing smoothly. In mid-June, with German consent, Đurišić moved to the Podgorica area with a group of associates to personally direct the formation of the 8th Regiment of the CDK. He reorganised the Chetnik forces under his command, dividing them into two territorial structures (one under a command staff for Montenegro and Boka Kotorska and the other under a command staff for Stari Ras). Collaboration between Đurišić's forces and the Germans continued into late 1944. On 13 July 1944, Radio Belgrade praised Đurišić \\"for his services to the Axis cause\\". The 8th Regiment of the CDK was nearly destroyed in August by the 7th Montenegro Youth Brigade \\"Budo Tomović\\" during Operation Rübezahl. The CDK suffered heavy losses in fighting, and the Germans ordered its re-formation on 21 September 1944. Đurišić and his forces conducted reprisals against the population in Pljevlja, Prijepolje, Priboj, and Nova Varoš. The Chetniks also raided villages to intimidate and eradicate Partisan sympathisers, notably at Bjelopavlići, where 48 communists were executed. Đurišić remained in Montenegro until the end of Operation Rübezahl in late August 1944, after which he returned to the Sandžak. Following Operation Rübezahl, the presence of Partisan and German forces in northern Montenegro and the Sandžak was reduced and the focus of operations shifted to Serbia. Remaining Partisan units quickly re-established domination over temporarily lost territories and the German 181st Infantry Division ordered its three battalions that remained isolated in the Pljevlja area to break through Partisan-held territory and reunite with the rest of the division at Mateševo. This plan, codenamed Nordsturm, relied on the substantial participation of Đurišić's units. It fitted well with Đurišić's general orientation to move towards the coast, where an Allied landing was expected. Nordsturm began on 31 August. Đurišić and the Germans made progress at first, capturing Kolašin and Berane, but the towns were quickly retaken by the Partisans, who went on the counterattack and proceeded to capture a string of towns in northern and western Montenegro and eastern Herzegovina. Đurišić maintained contact with Lukačević, who at that time had begun to attack the Germans in Herzegovina with his own forces. Đurišić considered the possibility of joining Lukačević in fighting the Germans in anticipation of an Allied landing. However, because Lukačević was quickly defeated and no Allied landing occurred, Đurišić remained tied to the Germans. German intelligence closely tracked Đurišić's communications and movements, and German commands continued to make use of his forces. The Germans counted Đurišić's Chetniks as part of Army Group E in a survey of available forces dated 16 November 1944. In the survey, German forces in Montenegro at that time were estimated at 47,000 soldiers, including Đurišić's 10,000 Chetniks.United States National Archives, Record Group 242, Microfilm series T311, Roll 184, frames 000386–7, Army Group E High Command, A Survey of the Numerical Strength of the Subordinated Units on 16 November 1944 On 21 October 1944, the Partisans took the Grahovo garrison after a five-day battle. On 6 November, the Partisans surrounded Cetinje, which was defended by the Germans, remaining Italian fascist Blackshirts, and about 600 Chetniks. On 8 November, the Germans and Chetniks in Cetinje were reinforced with a formation of 800–1,000 Chetniks led by Đurišić, which eventually succeeded in breaking through the Partisan blockade. On 11 October 1944, at the suggestion of von Weichs, Wilhelm Keiper, the German Plenipotentiary General in Montenegro, awarded Đurišić the Iron Cross (2nd Class) in the name of the Führer and the German High Command for fighting against the Partisans. = Withdrawal from Montenegro and death = breakout from Montenegro: Green: Germans Black: Đurišić's Chetniks Red: Partisans On 14 November, the German XXI Mountain Corps launched an assault from Podgorica towards Nikšić to clear a corridor through which the German forces in Montenegro could withdraw towards the Reich. This task was entrusted to the 363rd Grenadier Regiment of the 181st Infantry Division reinforced with artillery. It was supported by two combined German battle groups and the Italian 86th National Republican Guard (GNR) Battalionformerly the 86th Blackshirts (CCNN) Battalion. Around 1,200 of Đurišić's Chetniks were deployed on the flanks of the attack. The main Partisan formation facing this assault was the 6th Montenegrin Brigade, which was supported by the artillery group of the 2nd Shock Corps and the 211th (East Lancashire) Battery of the British 111th Field Artillery Regiment, Royal Artillery, which had been landed at Dubrovnik in late October to support the Partisans with their 25-pounder guns. Twelve days of fierce fighting resulted in significant casualties, and the Germans made no progress, losing Boka in the meantime. On 25 November, the Germans decided to abandon this line of attack and attack Kolašin. Chetniks under Đurišić's command continued to fight alongside the Germans. After reaching Kolašin, Đurišić's force separated from the Germans and headed towards Bosnia, marching to the west of the Germans and bypassing Pljevlja. During the breakout and subsequent withdrawal, both the Germans and Chetniks were subjected to frequent attacks by the Allies. According to German documents, Đurišić's forces forcibly recruited men, beat women and looted villages during their withdrawal from Montenegro. Đurišić's forces proceeded to north-eastern Bosnia to join Mihailović. Đurišić had wanted to withdraw through Albania to Greece but Mihailović told him to prepare for an Allied landing, the return of the king, and the establishment of a national government. After Đurišić joined Mihailović in north-eastern Bosnia, he was critical of Mihailović's leadership and argued strongly for all remaining Chetnik troops to move to Slovenia. Mihailović was not persuaded; Đurišić decided to move to Slovenia independently of Mihailović and arranged for Ljotić's forces, which were already there, to meet him near Bihać in western Bosnia to assist his movement. When he left Mihailović, he was joined by Chetnik ideologue Dragiša Vasić and the detachments commanded by Ostojić and Petar Baćović, and around 10,000 refugees. This force was formed into the Chetnik 8th Montenegrin Army consisting of the 1st, 5th, 8th and 9th (Herzegovina) divisions. To reach Bihać, Đurišić made a safe-conduct agreement with elements of the Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) and with the Montenegrin separatist Drljević. The details of the agreement are not known, but it is thought he and his troops intended to cross the Sava river into Slavonia where they would join Drljević as the Montenegrin National Army, of which Đurišić was the operational commander. Đurišić apparently tried to outsmart them and sent only his sick and wounded troops across the river, keeping his fit troops south of the river. He began moving his command westwards; harassed by the NDH troops and Partisans, Đurišić's forces reached the Vrbas river north of Banja Luka in late May. Between 30 May and 8 April, the combined Chetnik force was defeated by a strong NDH force armed with German-supplied tanks, in the Battle of Lijevče Field. This was probably the largest combat action between NDH forces and the Chetniks in the previous two years. After this defeat and the defection of one of his sub-units to Drljević, Đurišić was forced to negotiate directly with the leaders of the NDH forces about the further movement of his Chetniks towards Slovenia. This appears to have been a trap; he was attacked and captured by the NDH on his way to the meeting. Events after his capture are unclear, but Đurišić, Vasić, Ostojić, and Baćović were subsequently killed along with others, including some Serbian Orthodox priests. According to Pajović, the Ustaše executed Đurišić in late April 1945 at the Jasenovac concentration camp. The website of the Jasenovac Memorial Site says Đurišić was killed at the camp by the Ustaše in 1945. The location of Đurišić's grave, if any, is unknown. Both the NDH forces and Drljević had reasons for ensnaring Đurišić. The NDH forces were motivated by Đurišić's terror attacks against the Muslim population in Sandžak and south-eastern Bosnia. Drljević opposed Đurišić's support of a union of Serbia and Montenegro, which was counter to Drljević's separatism. = Aftermath = Some of Đurišić's troops escaped and travelled west. Some were killed by Partisan forces, who were to the south of their intended withdrawal route west to Slovenia. The majority, left without a leader, were integrated into Drljević's Montenegrin National Army and withdrew towards the Austrian border. Portions of both groups were later captured in Slovenia by the Partisans. About 1,000 of Đurišić's Chetniks crossed into Austria but were forced to return to Yugoslavia, where some were killed by the Partisans near the Yugoslav–Austrian border. Most were taken to southern Slovenia, where they were killed and their bodies thrown into deep abysses in the Kočevski Rog area. According to Tomasevich, the killing of the Montenegrin Chetniks by the Partisans at Kočevski Rog was an \\"act of mass terror and brutal political surgery\\" similar to that carried out by the Chetniks earlier in the war. It was partly an act of revenge for the mass terror carried out by the Chetniks against the Partisans and pro-Partisan segments of the population and partly to stop the Chetniks from continuing an armed struggle against the communists, perhaps with Western assistance. Less than a quarter of the force that began with Đurišić in Montenegro, and other Chetniks who joined him during the journey north and west, survived. A few weeks later, Drljević, who had fled to Austria, was discovered by followers of Đurišić and killed. Đurišić was one of the most able Yugoslav Chetnik leaders; his fighting skills were respected by his allies and opponents. Commemoration controversy alt=a concrete plinth with a bust on top of it The Serbian diaspora in the United States set up a monument dedicated to Đurišić at the Serbian cemetery in Libertyville, Illinois. The management and players of the football club Red Star Belgrade visited it on 23 May 2010. In May 2002, plans for a \\"Montenegrin Ravna Gora\\" memorial complex to be located near Berane were prepared. The complex was to be dedicated to Đurišić, who spent some of his youth in Berane and established his wartime headquarters there. In June 2003, the Montenegrin Minister of Culture Vesna Kilibarda banned the construction of the monument, saying the Ministry of Culture had not received an application to erect it. The Association of War Veterans of the National Liberation Army (SUBNOR) objected to the construction of the monument, saying Đurišić was a war criminal who was responsible for the deaths of many colleagues of the veterans association and 7,000 Muslims. The Muslim Association of Montenegro condemned the construction and stated, \\"this is an attempt to rehabilitate him and it is a great insult to the children of the innocent victims and the Muslim people in Montenegro\\". On 4 July 2002, the Montenegrin government forbade the unveiling of the monument, stating that it \\"caused public concern, encouraged division among the citizens of Montenegro, and incited national and religious hatred and intolerance\\". A press release from the committee in charge of the monument's construction said the actions taken by the government were \\"absolutely illegal and inappropriate\\". On 7 July, the police removed the stand that had been prepared for the monument. In 2011, the Montenegrin Serb political party New Serb Democracy (NOVA) renewed efforts to build a monument; they stated that Đurišić and other royal Yugoslav officers were \\"leaders of the 13 July uprising\\" and they \\"continued their struggle to liberate the country under the leadership of King Peter and the Government of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia\\".

It is located on the steep southeastern slopes of Signal Hill above the Otago Harbour. It lies on the harbour's northern shore, east-northeast of the city centre. Ravensbourne's 2001 population was 1,269. Rail and road links between central Dunedin and Port Chalmers run through Ravensbourne on the narrow strip of land between the hill slopes and harbour. A cycleway also links the suburb with the main part of the city, which lies to the west on the far side of a bluff partly occupied by the Logan Point Quarry. One of the older harbourside suburbs, it has a distinct identity from the rest of the city's inner suburbs. The suburb is mainly residential, but is dominated by two large industrial plants, the Logan Point Quarry and the Ravensdown Fertiliser factory, which is located at the harbour's edge at the southern end of the suburb. Ravensdown contains 25,062 shareholders and has over 90 stores New Zealand wide. Ravensdown has many partnerships including spreading companies such as Spreading Sandfords, Spreading Northland, Spreading FBT Ravensbourne contains a significant number of smaller homes, quite a number of which are occupied as flats by students from the University of Otago and Otago Polytechnic, which lie to the west. The suburb consists mainly of the Dunedin-Port Chalmers highway, State Highway 88, and numerous narrow winding roads which climb the hill to its northwest. Above the suburb is Burns Park Scenic Reserve, which occupies much of the upper slopes of Signal Hill. The suburb, along with the nearby suburbs of Maia, Burkes, and Saint Leonards, are often collectively referred to as West Harbour. Under this name, the area was a separate borough for many years from 1877 until amalgamation with the city of Dunedin in 1963. The suburb takes its name from the property of the first mayor of West Harbour, Thomas De Lacy, who was mayor from 1877 to 1878. The name was due to the profusion of weka in the area of De Lacy's property, whose cockiness reminded De Lacy of the ravens in his native Scotland. The Maori name for the area is Kaitaki Tamariki, though this is rarely used today. The smaller settlements of Maia and Burkes lie on the coast of the harbour immediately to the northeast of Ravensbourne. Maia, basically a suburb of Ravensbourne, lies to the northeast. Its name and the pronunciation of it mean that it is often mistaken for a Maori name, though it was actually named for the Greek mythological daughter of Atlas, one of the Pleiades. Burkes lies to the northeast of Maia, and consists of one long narrow road running roughly parallel with and above the highway. The most notable feature of Burkes is that the South Island Main Trunk railway crosses a series of causeways spanning some of the small bays which run along the harbour's edge. North of Burkes is the larger settlement of Saint Leonards, which was named by early settler David Carey for the English town of St Leonards-on-Sea, on the Sussex coast, which had been the birthplace of his wife. p. 372 p. 309 Ravensbourne and Maia are shown in this view from Shiel Hill on the southern side of Otago Harbour. One of the railway causeways at Burkes is visible at the far right. The television transmitter on the top of Mount Cargill is visible behind Signal Hill in the background.

VFL career  Hobbs was recruited from Daylesford and joined Footscray as a rover. Hobbs is best remembered for a spectacular mark which he took in the 1961 Preliminary Final where Footscray upset Melbourne to end their streak of seven successive Grand Final appearances. His team lost the 1961 Grand Final comfortably to Hawthorn but he played in back to back Night Series Premierships in 1963 and 1964. Hobbs often rested in the forward pocket and was handy near goals. In an era where Footscray lacked big goal-kickers, Hobbs contributed one and a half goals a game. He kicked a career best eight goals in a game against South Melbourne at Western Oval early into his second season. His season tally of 16 goals in 1963 was enough to share Footscray's goal kicking award and his 24 goals in 1965 won it outright. An injury sustained at training in the 1966 pre-season in which he tore his anterior and interior ligaments as well as cartilage in his right knee, ended his VFL career. Hobbs was 23 when his VFL career was ended through the serious injury  Post VFL career  In 1966, Hobbs played 4 games for VFA team, Yarraville. This was curtailed with ongoing problems with the injured knee. In 1968, Hobbs Captain-Coached, Seddon, in the Footscray Districts League. In 1971, Hobbs coached Footscray Under 19's to 5th spot on the ladder, then supplying the Footscray Seniors with many young stars. In 1972, Hobbs missed out on the Footscray Seniors coaching job, only being beaten by last minute applicant, who was Bob Rose, the champion Collingwood player and coach. Also Hobbs then was appointed in 1972, Captain-Coach of Melton Football Club, on top of the ladder all year and unbeaten. Melton beat Darley by 10 goals in the second semi-final, only to have a tragic loss that night, of their star player, best and fairest winner, Cahill, who was killed in a car accident. Playing Darley again in the Grand Final, Melton were hot favourites for the win, after being unbeaten all year, a win was on track until player Fanning, push Hobbs into the iron fence and broke his jaw. His brother, Bonga, who was on the bench, right where the incident happened, jumped up and knocked out 6'6 Fanning. With the loss of Cahill, and the severe injury to Hobbs, their playing coach, Melton played the man and not the ball and ultimately lost the Grand Final. In 1973, Hobbs played for Brunswick in a losing Grand Final. In 1974, Hobbs Captain-Coached Unbeaten Newport to the Flag. In 1976, Hobbs was chairman of selectors for Footscray Football Club. In 1977, Hobbs and his brother Dave, kicked 10 goals between them in the Grand Final to win by 8 goals over hot favourites, Benalla All Blacks in a violent Grand Final in the Benalla District League giving Longwood their first premiership in 24 years. The Following year, 1978, Hobbs and his brother were assistant coaches at West Newport to Charlie Menzies, the Coach, who Merv had coached at Footscray Under 19's in 1971. On a very windy day for the second semi final, West Newport were beaten by Brooklyn by 2 points, but responded in the Grand Final, by winning at a margin of 39 points, Hobbs and his brother kicked 6 goals between them giving West Newport their first premiership in 9 years. In 1979 & 1980, Hobbs coached Williamstown in the VFA Second Division, playing in the finals in both years, supplying a 15 year old, Ian Fairley to North Melbourne in the VFL. Hobbs went on to being President of Williamstown Football Club for many years.

The term is based on the similar money laundering.  Hiding responsibility for a policy or decision  One common method for policy laundering is the use of international treaties which are formulated in secrecy. Afterwards it is not possible to find out who advocated for which part of the treaty. Each person can claim that it was not them who demanded a certain paragraph but that they had to agree to the overall \\"compromise\\". Examples that could be considered as \\"policy laundering\\" are WIPOYu, Peter K., The Political Economy of Data Protection, Chicago-Kent Law Review, Vol. 83, 2008 or the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA).  Hiding the real objective of a policy  One manifestation of policy laundering is claiming a different underlying objective for a policy than is actually the case. The usual reason for politicians following this approach is that the real objective is unpopular with the public. The usual process is to conflate the issue being addressed with an unrelated matter of great public concern. The intervention pursued is presented as addressing an issue of great public concern rather than the underlying objective.  Circumventing the regular approval process  Yet another manifestation of policy laundering is to implement legal policy which a subset of legislators desire but would normally not be able to obtain approval through regular means. An example of policy laundering where law was enacted and enforced despite both state and federal courts declaring the law unconstitutional is the Missouri v. Holland case. At that time, Congress attempted to protect migratory birds by statutory law.An Act Making Appropriations for the Department of Agriculture for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1914, Act of March 4, 1913, 38 Stat. 828, c. 145, at page 847. However, both state and federal courts declared that law unconstitutional.United States v. Shauver, 214 Fed. 154 (E.D. Ark. 1914), United States v. McCullagh, 221 Fed. 288 (D.Kan. 1915), State v. Sawyer, 94 A. 886 (Maine 1915), and State v. McCullagh, 153 P. 557 (Kan. 557). Not to be denied, authorized parties subsequently negotiated and ratified a treaty with Canada to achieve the same purpose.Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds of August 16, 1916, T.S. No. 628, 39 Stat. 1702. Once the treaty was in place, Congress then passed the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 to enforce the treaty.Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Act of July 3, 1918, c. 128, 40 Stat. 755. Codified at 18 U.S.C.§703. In Missouri v. Holland, the United States Supreme Court upheld that the new law was constitutional in order to support the treaty. It has been suggestedThe Policy Laundering ProjectACLU's Stop Policy Laundering ProjectBarry Steinhardt (ACLU) \\"The Problem of Policy Laundering\\" that policy laundering has become common political practice in areas related to terrorism and the erosion of civil liberties. In the air- travel industry, an example of policy laundering might be the requirement for passengers to show photographic identification. This was presented as addressing security concerns, but from the airline's perspective the measure had the important effect of ending unauthorised resale by passengers of unused tickets.

Life  As daughter to the Swiss couple Moritz and Luise Rotten, she attended the \\"höhere Mädchenschule Luisenschule\\" during 1888-1898, later studying at the Victorialyzeum Berlin from 1904. In September 1906 she took the Reifeprüfung at the Kaiserin Augusta-Gymnasium Charlottenburg. She graduated in her studies in philosophy and German language and literature in Heidelberg, Berlin, Marburg and Montpellier. In Marburg she met with Hermann Lietz and Gustav Wyneken, which was vital to the future development of her thinking. In 1913 she published her PhD thesis under the title \\"Goethes Urphänomen und die platonische Idee\\" (Goethe's \\"Urphänomen\\" and the Platonic ideal) in Marburg. In 1913 she began lecturing at the University of Cambridge on German literature. In 1914 she returned to Berlin and worked in the \\"Auskunfts- und Hilfsstelle für Deutsche im Ausland und Ausländer in Deutschland\\" with professor Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze. In the same year she co-founded the \\"Bund Neues Vaterland\\", later the \\"German League for Human Rights\\". In 1915 she travelled as a representative to the 1st International Women's Congress in The Hague and worked for the foundation of the \\"Internationalen Frauenliga für Frieden und Freiheit\\" (International Women's League for Peace and Freedom\\"). In 1922, together with Beatrice Ensor and Adolphe Ferrière she founded the New Education Fellowship becoming its vice-chair for German-speaking countries and editor, of its German language journal which eventually came to be called Das Werdende Zeitalter.Brehony, K.

From 1922 she was associated with the school farm, Schulfarm Insel Scharfenberg, begun by Wilhelm Blume in Berlin and was a frequent visitor to the Odenwaldschule founded in 1910 by the educational reformer Paul Geheeb. In 1925, Rotten and Adolphe Ferrière became the first Deputy Directors of the International Bureau of Education (IBE), where they provided support to Director Pierre Bovet. She was also a friend of the anarchist, Gustav Landauer, who was Minister of Culture in the short-lived Munich Soviet (or “Council Republic”) of 1919 before being murdered after it was violently suppressed. From 1926 until 1932, Rotten shared the editorship of the journal Das Werdende Zeitalter with Karl Wilker, an exponent of social pedagogy who transformed the Lindenhof in Berlin. The title of this journal was inspired by that given to a collection of essays by Landauer, which his friend, the philosopher Martin Buber, published in 1921. In 1930, Rotten co- founded a school at Hellerau just outside Dresden, where a garden city was established shortly after 1900 as part of a reform movement advocating modern housing.Brehony, K. J.

Morrill County, Nebraska is named after him.Morrill, Charles Henry. The Morrills and Reminiscences. Lincoln: University Publishing Co., 1918. Biography He was born in Concord, New Hampshire, the only child of Ephraim and Mahala (Lampery) Morrill. His mother died when he was twelve, and he spent the remainder of his childhood living with his aunt Susan Gay and attending a nearby school, the New London Academy. In the summer of 1862 he enlisted at New London as a musician in Company I, 11th New Hampshire Volunteer Regiment. Three weeks later he married Harriet Zinnia Currier before leaving with his unit. He was present at many important battles, including the Battle of Fredericksburg and the Siege of Vicksburg and mustered out on June 4, 1865. He states in his autobiography that after the war, he \\"took Horace Greeley's advice\\" (Go West, young man) and in 1866 went west in a covered wagon to establish a homestead near Marion, Ohio. Due to poor weather and being an inexperienced farmer, his crops failed for several years in a row. He was so poor he was unable to afford coffee. However, the weather and his fortunes turned around, and by 1870 he was producing both decent crop and a valuable herd of cattle. In the spring of 1873, he moved his family of five and one hundred head of cattle to Stromsburg, Nebraska. There, he ran a farm and helped run a small store \\"with 6,000 Pawnee Indians less than 25 miles away.\\" Business and politics When his sons were old enough to help with the farm, Morrill started spending less time farming. In 1880, Morrill became private secretary to Governor Albinus Nance. After Nance completed his term as Governor, they went into business together, forming the Bank of Stromsburg, Nebraska. He was afterwards President of the Lincoln (Nebraska) Land Company and also President of the South Platte Land Company, the Lancaster Land Company, and the Boston Investment Company. Morrill eventually began helping the Burlington Railroad explore the midwest territories to report on conditions and determine the best routes for the railroads. He made a considerable amount of money buying land where the railroad line would eventually come, and selling it once the railroad line was built. He went on many exploration parties through largely Indian-controlled territory and acquired a large collection of American Indian artifacts through trading. One of his guides was Colonel W. F. Cody, Buffalo Bill, who helped him explore the Yosemite Valley in Wyoming on behalf of the railroad. For many years afterward, Morrill was invited on a yearly hunting expedition that Cody organized for his friends. His exploration work helped Morrill to establish the location for what became Scottsbluff, Nebraska. Shortly thereafter, he laid out a tract of land for a town at the western edge of the state and named it after himself, thereby creating the town of Morrill, Nebraska. In the year 1908, the Nebraska State Legislature divided Cheyenne County, and the part north of the division line was named Morrill County, Nebraska, in recognition of Charles Henry Morrill's contribution to the development of this part of the state. Connection with University of Nebraska Charles Henry Morrill became a member of the Board of Regents of University of Nebraska in 1890, and was President of the Board between 1893-1903. Between 1890 and 1903, enrollment at the University grew from 300 to 3000. While a regent, he was a strong benefactor, donating Morrill Hall. He also contributed funds for paleontological research under Dr. Erwin Hinckly Barbour, establishing the Morrill Geological Yearly Expeditions. The Expeditions populated the University Museum with a wide array of dinosaur and mammoth bones, and their finds were published in the volumes of the Nebraska Geological Survey. A new type of early American Indian arrowhead was discovered by the Expeditions and named a Morrill Point. Mr. Morrill collected thousands of American Indian specimens in the course of his dealings with the local tribes, and these were donated to the University Museum.

It is primarily known as the site of one of the key engagements in the Siege of Plevna during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878. Geography Located 9 kilometres east of Pleven at an average 208 metres above sea level and lying in the hilly basin of the Vit River, Grivitsa has a population of 1,778 as of December 2009. Bulgarian National Statistical Institute - Bulgarian Settlements 1000-5000 inhabitants - December 2009 The railway line connecting Sofia to Varna and Rousse runs through the village, as well as the main road from Pleven to Rousse, Nikopol and Pordim. The highest point of the Central Danubian Plain, the 304-metre-high Sredni vrah (, \\"Middle Peak\\") is just to the east of the village. The soil is rich in clay but suitable for agriculture. The area is also rich in limestone and quarries for its extraction have been built in several places. History Romanian troops storming the Grivitsa redoubt during the Romanian War of Independence of 1877–1878 The village's location has shifted several times, with the earliest known settlement being in the Ezero area to the south of modern Grivitsa, identified with the time after the Ottoman conquest of Bulgaria (14th-15th century). The plague forced the locals to move to the present location. The legend surrounding the image's name asserts that the area between Trastenik and Slavyanovo, including Grivitsa, was the feud (vakıf) of an Ottoman noble known as Trastenik Pasha, who was an avid dove- and bee-keeper. He is thought to have built a dove-cot and an apiary in the Rogultsi area near today's Grivitsa, and bred wood pigeons (known as гривяк, grivyak in Bulgarian). Gradually, the locals came to be known as grivatsi and the village as Grivitsa. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, Grivitsa was the location of an important Ottoman position featuring several redoubts and acting as part of the defensive fortifications of Pleven. The Battle of Grivitsa was part of the prolonged Siege of Plevna which resulted in the death of many Russian and particularly Romanian soldiers: the losses of the Romanian units in this battle were the largest for the entire war. Grivitsa has a school built in 1916, as well as a park arranged in 1956 and a museum opened in 1967, both commemorating the events of 1877. A Romanian mausoleum with an ossuary was built in 1892–1897 using funds collected by the Romanian people and opened in 1902.The mausoleum In honour of the battle, several communes and neighbourhoods in Romania, as well as the Romanian NMS Grivița, bear the name Grivița, a Romanian rendition of the village's name.

History In 1837, William G. and Polly Craig acquired property west of Georgetown in Scott County, Kentucky from William Suggett, Polly's father. Craig was a Baptist minister and faculty member at Georgetown College. He constructed a Greek Revival mansion on the land in 1850 and called it Oakland. According to local legend, as recounted by Ann Bolton in A History of Scott County as Told by Selected Buildings (1989), Craig called on his cousin to act as contractor for construction of the mansion. Newton Craig, superintendent of the Kentucky State Penitentiary, had the house built by convict labor. The superintendent earned $21,826 and the state $37,899 in the transaction. H.C. Allen, known for developing the first American Aberdeen Angus cattle herd, purchased the property and renamed it Allenhurst.

He later expanded his business and became an important contractor in Detroit, helping to build several commercial blocks and residences, including the Globe Tobacco Building. He also served on the Water Board and was appointed to a commission that selected an architect for the Michigan state capitol. Chapoton's son, Alexander Jr., joined the family business and eventually inherited a greater fortune than his father had. Chapoton built this house in the late 1870s as rental property. However, Chapoton himself lived in the home until his death in 1893. House The house is a three-story brick building with its foundation placed at the edge of the sidewalk. The stone-faced basement raises the first floor several feet off the ground. The facade is asymmetrical, with a three-bay first floor upper floors of differing height. The brick and stone hoods over the windows vary from floor to floor. It is believed that the first and second stories were once separated by cast iron panels which were removed during renovation. The interior floor plan is unusual, having space for Victorian Living hall. The interior still retains the original trim, staircase and parlor fireplace.

Hill, John Gallagher, American Institute of Architects Detroit Chapter, AIA Detroit: The American Institute of Architects Guide to Detroit Architecture, 2002, Wayne State University Press, , p.36 In the years following the house's construction, the area around it was cleared for commercial development. The development was especially prevalent in the 1960s and 1970s; as a result, only a few row houses remain. The Alexander Chapoton House is one of the last examples of Queen Anne style row houses in the city. The house was used as a rooming house for several decades. In the 1980s, it was purchased and renovated. Currently, the first floor is art gallery, studios are located in the basement and offices are on the upper floors.

In Japanese mythology, Amenominakanushi is described as a \\"god who came into being alone\\" (hitorigami), the first of the zōka sanshin (\\"three kami of creation\\"), and one of the five kotoamatsukami (\\"distinguished heavenly gods\\").  Origin  Amenominakanushi had been considered a concept developed under the influence of Chinese thought, but now most scholars believe otherwise.匝瑤 葵「宇宙を構成する古事記の別天神―出雲大社の天空神」 『アジア遊学』No.121, pp.94-101, 勉誠出版, 2009年 With the flourishing of kokugaku the concept was studied by scholars. The theologian Hirata Atsutane identified Amenominakanushi as the spirit of the North Star, master of the seven stars of the Big Dipper. The god was emphasized by the Daikyōin in the Meiji period, and worshipped by some Shinto sects.  Kami concept  The god manifests in a duality, a male and a female function, respectively Takamimusubi and Kamimusubi.Kitagawa, 1987. p. 29 In other mythical accounts the originating kami is called Umashiashikabihikoji (\\"God of the Ashi [Reed]\\") or Kuninotokotachi (the \\"God Founder of the Nation\\"), the latter used in the Nihon Shoki.Kitagawa, 1987. pp. 28-29 Some sources identify these deities as the three Kamis called (three creator-Kami\\", a conceptualization that also reflect the so-called Kami of the threefold whirl (Amatsu uzu-uzushiyatsunagi) in Yamakage Shinto.

It extends the classic method of principal component analysis (PCA) for the reduction of dimensionality of data by introducing sparsity structures to the input variables. A particular disadvantage of ordinary PCA is that the principal components are usually linear combinations of all input variables. Sparse PCA overcomes this disadvantage by finding linear combinations that contain just a few input variables. Contemporary datasets often have the number of input variables (p) comparable with or even much larger than the number of samples (n). It has been shown that if p/n does not converge to zero, the classical PCA is not consistent. But sparse PCA can retain consistency even if p\\\\gg n.  Mathematical formulation  Consider a data matrix, X, where each of the p columns represent an input variable, and each of the n rows represents an independent sample from data population. One assumes each column of X has mean zero, otherwise one can subtract column-wise mean from each element of X. Let \\\\Sigma=\\\\frac{1}{n-1} X^\\\\top X be the empirical covariance matrix of X, which has dimension p \\\\times p. Given an integer k with 1\\\\le k \\\\le p, the sparse PCA problem can be formulated as maximizing the variance along a direction represented by vector v \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^p while constraining its cardinality: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\max \\\\quad & v^{T} \\\\Sigma v\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{subject to} \\\\quad & \\\\left\\\\Vert v\\\\right\\\\Vert _{2}=1\\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\left\\\\Vert v \\\\right\\\\Vert_{0}\\\\leq k. \\\\end{align} The first constraint specifies that v is a unit vector. In the second constraint, \\\\left\\\\Vert v \\\\right\\\\Vert_{0} represents the L0 norm of v, which is defined as the number of its non-zero components. So the second constraint specifies that the number of non-zero components in v is less than or equal to k, which is typically an integer that is much smaller than dimension p. The optimal value of is known as the k-sparse largest eigenvalue. If one takes k=p, the problem reduces to the ordinary PCA, and the optimal value becomes the largest eigenvalue of covariance matrix Σ. After finding the optimal solution v, one deflates Σ to obtain a new matrix : \\\\Sigma_1 = \\\\Sigma - (v^T \\\\Sigma v)v v^T, and iterate this process to obtain further principal components. However, unlike PCA, sparse PCA cannot guarantee that different principal components are orthogonal. In order to achieve orthogonality, additional constraints must be enforced. The following equivalent definition is in matrix form. Let V be a p×p symmetric matrix, one can rewrite the sparse PCA problem as : \\\\begin{align} \\\\max \\\\quad & Tr(\\\\Sigma V)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{subject to}\\\\quad & Tr(V)=1\\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\Vert V \\\\Vert_{0}\\\\leq k^{2}\\\\\\\\\\\\ & Rank(V)=1, V\\\\succeq 0. \\\\end{align} Tr is the matrix trace, and \\\\Vert V \\\\Vert_{0} represents the non-zero elements in matrix V. The last line specifies that V has matrix rank one and is positive semidefinite. The last line means that one has V=vv^T, so is equivalent to . Moreover, the rank constraint in this formulation is actually redundant, and therefore sparse PCA can be cast as the following mixed-integer semidefinite program : : \\\\begin{align} \\\\max \\\\quad & Tr(\\\\Sigma V)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{subject to}\\\\quad & Tr(V)=1\\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\vert V_{i,i}\\\\vert \\\\leq z_i, \\\\forall i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{1, ..., p\\\\\\\\}, \\\\vert V_{i,j}\\\\vert \\\\leq \\\\frac{1}{2} z_i, \\\\forall i,j \\\\in \\\\\\\\{1, ..., p\\\\\\\\}: i eq j,\\\\\\\\\\\\ & V\\\\succeq 0, z \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0, 1\\\\\\\\}^p, \\\\sum_i z_i \\\\leq k \\\\end{align} Because of the cardinality constraint, the maximization problem is hard to solve exactly, especially when dimension p is high. In fact, the sparse PCA problem in is NP-hard in the strong sense.  Algorithms for Sparse PCA  Several alternative approaches (of ) have been proposed, including * a regression framework, * a convex relaxation/semidefinite programming framework, * a generalized power method framework * an alternating maximization framework * forward-backward greedy search and exact methods using branch-and-bound techniques, * a certifiably optimal branch-and-bound approach * Bayesian formulation framework. * A certifiably optimal mixed- integer semidefinite branch-and-cut approach The methodological and theoretical developments of Sparse PCA as well as its applications in scientific studies are recently reviewed in a survey paper. = Regression approach via lasso (elastic net)  Semidefinite Programming Relaxation = It has been proposed that sparse PCA can be approximated by semidefinite programming (SDP). If one drops the rank constraint and relaxes the cardinality constraint by a 1-norm convex constraint, one gets a semidefinite programming relaxation, which can be solved efficiently in polynomial time: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\max \\\\quad & Tr(\\\\Sigma V)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{subject to}\\\\quad & Tr(V)=1\\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\mathbf{1}^T V\\\\mathbf{1} \\\\leq k\\\\\\\\\\\\ & V\\\\succeq 0. \\\\end{align} In the second constraint, \\\\mathbf{1} is a p×1 vector of ones, and V is the matrix whose elements are the absolute values of the elements of V. The optimal solution V to the relaxed problem is not guaranteed to have rank one. In that case, V can be truncated to retain only the dominant eigenvector. While the semidefinite program does not scale beyond n=300 covariates, it has been shown that a second-order cone relaxation of the semidefinite relaxation is almost as tight and successfully solves problems with n=1000s of covariates  Applications = Financial Data Analysis = Suppose ordinary PCA is applied to a dataset where each input variable represents a different asset, it may generate principal components that are weighted combination of all the assets. In contrast, sparse PCA would produce principal components that are weighted combination of only a few input assets, so one can easily interpret its meaning. Furthermore, if one uses a trading strategy based on these principal components, fewer assets imply less transaction costs. = Biology = Consider a dataset where each input variable corresponds to a specific gene. Sparse PCA can produce a principal component that involves only a few genes, so researchers can focus on these specific genes for further analysis. = High-dimensional Hypothesis Testing = Contemporary datasets often have the number of input variables (p) comparable with or even much larger than the number of samples (n). It has been shown that if p/n does not converge to zero, the classical PCA is not consistent. In other words, if we let k=p in , then the optimal value does not converge to the largest eigenvalue of data population when the sample size n\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty, and the optimal solution does not converge to the direction of maximum variance. But sparse PCA can retain consistency even if p\\\\gg n. The k-sparse largest eigenvalue (the optimal value of ) can be used to discriminate an isometric model, where every direction has the same variance, from a spiked covariance model in high- dimensional setting. Consider a hypothesis test where the null hypothesis specifies that data X are generated from a multivariate normal distribution with mean 0 and covariance equal to an identity matrix, and the alternative hypothesis specifies that data X is generated from a spiked model with signal strength \\\\theta: : H_0: X \\\\sim N(0, I_p), \\\\quad H_1: X \\\\sim N(0, I_p + \\\\theta v v^T), where v \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^p has only k non-zero coordinates. The largest k-sparse eigenvalue can discriminate the two hypothesis if and only if \\\\theta > \\\\Theta(\\\\sqrt{k \\\\log(p)/n}). Since computing k-sparse eigenvalue is NP-hard, one can approximate it by the optimal value of semidefinite programming relaxation (). If that case, we can discriminate the two hypotheses if \\\\theta > \\\\Theta(\\\\sqrt{k^2 \\\\log(p)/n}). The additional \\\\sqrt{k} term cannot be improved by any other polynomical time algorithm if the planted clique conjecture holds.

Kudavasal is a small town located in the Thiruvarur district, in between two distributaries of Cauvery river, Kudamurutti and Chola Choodamani. Lord Srinivasa appears with his consorts Sridevi and Bhoomadevi. Kudavasal temple's speciality is that it has the only north-facing sanctum of Lord Srinivasa in the World. The temple Srinivasa Perumal Temple at Kudavasal is more than 400 years old. Kudavasal used to be a home for many Vedic Pandits and Scholars, who offered their daily prayers to \\"Lord Srinivasa\\" and conducted all kinds of Utsavams in a grand manner including \\"Brahmothsavam\\" for ages. This holy Temple witnessed several spiritual events including the most venerated \\"Soma Yagam\\" performed by great scholars like Shri. U. Ve. Agnihotram Ramanuja Tatachariar and Shri. U. Ve. Siddhanna Sundaram Thathachariar. The temple follows the traditional Vadakalai sect of Iyengars. The temple was established by Maharajah Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara empire between the years 1509 to 1529 CE. It is believed that Lord Srinivasa appeared in the Maharaja's dream as an old man with the news that there is an idol buried at a certain location and has to face north to serve as younger brother of Tirumalai Venkateswara. The Maharaja personally used a golden plough at the location the very next day and the idol was miraculously dug out just like in his dream. The Maharaja bequeathed vast amount of lands to the temple. A scholarly Brahmin community was established near the temple for its upkeep. However, with the exodus of the community shifting their place of residence to cities, and with efflux of time, the Temple did not receive adequate attention and proper maintenance. Further, the income from the properties that the Temple enjoyed started dwindling. The last Samprokshanam to the Temple was performed in 1996 by the Board of Trustees with the help of Kudavasal Srinivasa Perumal Seva Samithi. During this renovation, the Temple Quarters was also rebuilt and a new ‘Transit House’ with basic amenities was constructed for the convenience of the sevarthis from outstations. Unfortunately, the beautiful Uthsava Murthis were stolen and with great efforts by the Board of Trustees, they were recovered subsequently. Thereafter, the Board of Trustees as well as the Kudavasal Srinivasa Perumal Seva Samithi took several steps to improve the security arrangements in the Temple. Thanks to these measures and perseverance, the Idols could be brought back to their original abode recently. Now, there is a proposal to conduct Samprokshanam afresh for the temple in view of last Samprokshanam was held in the year 1996. Efforts started with the Balalayam performed on 8 and 9 July 2008.

Gistel worked at the Museum of Natural History in Regensburg. He also wrote under pseudonomys Garduus, \\"G. Tilesius\\" (an anagram) and wrote on a range of topics. His contributions to entomology include descriptions of species with many new names proposed by him that are now mostly relegated to synonymy. Gistel's father Franz Xaver Gistl (1783–1815) worked at the a royal riding school, and died in 1813 and was raised only by his mother Maria Anna Gistl (née Hahn) (born 1772) and his older sister Katharina Leonora (born 1808). Based on school records, it is believed that his original name was Lorenz Gistl. He was educated in schools in Rempart and Schönfeld before joining the royal gymnasium in Munich in 1822. His degrees in medicine and philosophy appear to be fake. He was the author of works on entomology such as Die jetzt lebenden Entomologen, Kerffreunde und kerfsammler Europa’s und der übrigen Continente (1836) and Achthundert und zwanzig neue oder unbeschriebene wirbellose Thiere (1857). He was also the author of species descriptions of reptiles, amphibians, and molluscs. Gistel was ignored by most of his contemporary entomologists. Gistel has been accused of plagiarism and has been variously described as vain, boastful, superficial, a cheat, liar, and a \\"tragi-comic figure\\" by Embrik Strand and Walther Horn. His isolation may have prompted him to establish his own journal Faunus (1832–1835) where he published most of his species descriptions and was the member of a one-person society called the Münchener Verein für Naturkunde which gave out honorary diplomas in a bid to gain favours from selected entomologists. Such honorary diplomas were offered to Lorenz Oken (an erstwhile mentor of Gistel) and Maximilian Perty with pseudonymous signatures. Gregor Mendel was said to have failed an exam to become a teacher at a gymnasium because he made a mistake on the orders of mammals since he had referred to Naturgeschichte des Thierreichs, written by Gistel.

From 1845 to 1850, he served as director of the Russian American Company and the governor of Russian America. He is especially noted for having surveyed and mapped the still little-known coast of Alaska. His Atlas of the Northwest Coasts of America: from Bering Strait to Cape Corrientes and the Aleutian Islands was published in 1852 and contained 39 engraved maps. Career In 1821, Mikhail Tebenkov graduated from the Naval Cadet Corps School. For the next three years, he served on different ships in the Baltic Sea. In 1824, Tebenkov was put in charge of logging for shipbuilding purposes near Narva. In January 1825, he joined the Russian American Company, which led colonizing and trade efforts in North America. He would later command the company-owned brigantines Golovnin, Ryurik, Chichagov, and a sloop named Urup in 1826–1834. Tebenkov surveyed Norton Sound on behalf of the Imperial Russian Hydrographic Service in 1831 and was the first European to sight the bay that now bears his name. He surveyed Tebenkof Bay in 1833 before returning to St. Petersburg. In 1835 Tebenkov sailed from Cronstadt back to Alaska via Cape Horn as commander of the Russian American Company's ship Elena. He arrived in Sitka in April 1836. Between 1845 and 1850, Tebenkov served as the director of the Russian American Company and the governor of Russian America.

He was the founder and leader of many organizations and institutions which helped improved the political, educational, housing, health and economic conditions of Sea Island residents.  Life and career  Esau Jenkins in 1960 on John's Island, South Carolina Jenkins grew up during the times of segregation, when educational opportunities were not readily available to him. However, he knew the importance of education and was determined that his children and those of others would not be denied. In the 1940s, Esau and his wife Janie used their money from farming and selling produce to purchase several buses. These buses were used to transport their own children and others on the Sea Islands to school in Charleston and thus further their education. In 1951, he was instrumental in the establishment of Haut Gap High School on John's Island, so all children on the island would have the educational opportunity to better themselves. Today, Haut Gap is an advance studies magnet middle school. Jenkins’ buses also transported workers to jobs in the Charleston area. During the bus rides, Jenkins and his wife would teach their adult passengers the information needed to pass the literacy exam, so they could become registered voters. Jenkins realized the need for a systemic approach to adult education. At the invitation of Septima Clark, he traveled to Highlander Folk Center to meet with Myles Horton to discuss the need for adult education and citizen classes on the Sea Islands. The first citizenship school was established on John's Island at the Progressive Club (listed in 2007 on the National Register of Historic Places ). The Progressive Club was a co-op started in 1948 by Jenkins and other families on John's Island. Notable individuals participated in workshops including Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and many others. The co-op housed a community grocery store, gas station, recreation area, sleeping rooms, classroom space and allowed residents to trade goods and services to help each other in times of need. The school was so effective that it served as the model for other citizenship schools established throughout the South to teach adult education, basic literacy and political education classes and workshops, resulting in thousands of citizens becoming registered voters. Jenkins founded the Citizens Committee of Charleston in 1959 and the C.O. Federal Credit Union in 1966. This credit union helped to further the economic advancement of the community. Residents were able to secure low-interest loans to purchase homes, businesses, vehicles and even send their children to college. Jenkins was also one of the founders of Rural Mission, Inc. This initiative provided services for migrant and seasonal farm workers on the Sea Islands. In or about 1970, Rural Mission, Inc. received $96,000.00 through the Office of Economic Opportunity with the assistance of Senator Ernest F. Hollings to start a health clinic at Bethlehem United Methodist Church to serve the five sea islands of Charleston County: Johns Island, James Island, Wadmalaw Island, Edisto Island, and Yonges Island. In February 1972, the health clinic became a separate incorporated entity and was known as Sea Island Comprehensive Health Care Corporation, a comprehensive health care center for the Sea Island residents. Jenkins and his wife owned and operated a fruit and vegetable stand, a fleet of buses, a motel and restaurant in Charleston, SC and also on Atlantic Beach, SC. Mr. Jenkins was known for his iconic 1966 Volkswagen deluxe station wagon that he used for his work in the community and throughout the South. Printed on the back panels of the vehicle was Jenkins' motto: “Love is Progress, Hate is Expensive.” In 2014, the Jenkins family donated the back panels of the of the vehicle to the new Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture to become a part of one of the permanent exhibits entitled “Defining Freedom, Defending Freedom: The Era of Segregation”. The Smithsonian, the Jenkins family, and the Preservation Society of Charleston hosted the bus artifacts send off to the Smithsonian on June 1, 2014. This event was included in the Piccolo Spoleto Festival and several hundred attended. All local Charleston news outlets covered the story via interviews and articles about the event. The Historic Vehicle Association and the College of Charleston's Historic Preservation and Community Planning BA Program were instrumental in preserving the Volkswagen bus, and in September 2019, the bus was the 26th vehicle added to the National Historic Vehicle Register. Jenkins died on October 30, 1972. He has received many posthumous awards, including having a bridge, street, and health clinic named in his memory.

Kronblom hates his mother-in-law. When she comes to visit, he plays pranks on her so she will leave. History In 1927, Elov Persson sent in his draft for a new comic strip to the publisher Åhlén & Åkerlunds. Persson, who had previously worked on the comic strip Kaspersson in the magazine Smålänningen, wanted to be able to support himself on his comic strips. He hoped that his bald character with a long nose (later named Kronblom) would be appreciated by Åhlén & Åkerlunds, and the first Kronblom strip was published in the weekly magazine Allt för Alla on July 17, 1927 https://www.lambiek.net/artists/p/persson_elov.htm in Sweden. The strip became an instant success, and in 1932 it moved to the Swedish magazine Året Runt. In 1987, it moved to another Swedish magazine, Allers, where it is still published. The strip can also be found in the Swedish comic book 91:an, which is published biweekly. A Christmas album of Kronblom has been published in Sweden every year since 1930, that contains all Kronblom comic strips published that same year in Allers and 91:an. Elov's son, Gunnar Persson took over the comic strip in 1968 when his father died.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/p/persson_gunnar.htm In 2006, Gunnar's son, Jonas Persson, started drawing the comic strip together with his father. A weekly Kronblom comics magazine was created in 1997, but was canceled after four issues due to poor sales.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/p/persson_elov.htm Kronblom has been the mascot of the Swedish association football team Örebro SK since 1987.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/p/persson_elov.htm  Kronblom in other media  Two live action films based on the strip have been made in Sweden. The first, entitled ', was released in 1947.

Edmunds purchased confectionery from a local shop and laced them with strychnine before returning them to be sold to unsuspecting members of the public. Her actions resulted in several people becoming seriously ill, and at least one death. Arrested and put on trial, Edmunds was initially sentenced to death. However, this was later commuted to life imprisonment. She spent the rest of her life in at the Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum, dying there in 1907. Poisoning spree Christiana Edmunds was born in Margate, Kent, and was the eldest child of William Edmunds, an architect who designed the local Holy Trinity Church and Margate Lighthouse. Her mother was Ann Christiana Burn, the sister of John Southerden Burn and daughter of a Royal Marines captain. Edmunds had a privileged upbringing and was privately educated, but was diagnosed with hysteria in her early twenties. It was while she was living with her widowed mother in Brighton, in the late 1860s, that Edmunds became involved with the local doctor, Charles Beard. The nature of their relationship remains a source of controversy but, in September 1870, Edmunds poisoned Dr Beard's wife by giving her a poisoned chocolate cream. However, Mrs Beard recovered from the resulting violent illness. Dr Beard said later that he suspected Edmunds had poisoned his wife at that time, but did not act on his suspicion, due to a lack of proof and a concern over the taint of scandal.Kaye Jones, 'The Case of the Chocolate Cream Killer: The Poisonous Passion of Christiana Edmunds, (Barnsley, Pen & Sword, 2016). In 1871, Edmunds began obtaining chocolate creams from the local confectioner, John Maynard. She took them home, laced them with strychnine, and returned them to the vendor. Maynard then sold them to the public, not knowing that they had been poisoned. Initially, Edmunds obtained the strychnine from a local chemist, Isaac Garrett, on the pretence that she needed it to poison stray cats. In an attempt to cover her tracks, she began paying young boys to purchase them for her. By this time, several people in Brighton had become ill after eating the chocolates, but no one had connected the illnesses with what the victims had eaten. However, in June 1871, 4-year-old Sidney Albert Barker, on holiday with his family, died as a result of eating chocolates from Maynard's shop. The Brighton coroner, David Black, ruled the death accidental. It was later confirmed that this was the only death caused by Edmunds. Edmunds increased her poisoning campaign, and began sending parcels of chocolates to prominent persons, including Mrs Beard, who again became violently ill. By this time, the police had connected the poisonings with the chocolates. Edmunds sent parcels to herself, claiming that she, too, was a victim of the poisoner, in the hope that this would deflect suspicion from her and on to Maynard. At this point, Dr Beard informed the police of his suspicions, which resulted in Edmunds being arrested and charged with the attempted murder of Mrs Beard and the murder of Sidney Barker. After committal hearings, it was decided to move the case from Lewes to the Old Bailey. During Edmunds's trial, which began in January 1872, her mother testified that both sides of their family had a history of mental illness. Dr Beard claimed that he and Edmunds never had a sexual relationship, but that instead it was merely a series of letters sent by her to him, and mild flirtations. Edmunds was sentenced to death, but this was commuted to life imprisonment due to her mental state. She spent the rest of her life in Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum, dying there in 1907. In popular culture The 1939, novel The Black Spectacles by John Dickson Carr is based on the Edmunds case. The Great Chocolate Murders, by John Fletcher, is a drama based on the events of the case, first broadcast by the BBC on Saturday 4 March 2006. It features Sîan Thomas, Chris Donnelly, Jennifer Hill, Dorien Thomas and Brendan Charleson, and was directed by Kate McAll. The case formed the basis of a puppet show, The Sorrowful Tale of Sleeping Sydney, by Daisy Jordan, which she performed at the Theatre Royal, Brighton in August 2017 (and again in October of that year, as part of the theatre's Out of Hours season.

It is known as the Battle of Split Allegiances among the Camerons. This is explained either by the fact that they deserted when faced with the prospect of supporting their feudal lord against their king, or that different factions in the clan lined up on both sides. Background Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany took effective control of the north of Scotland towards the end of the reign of his father Robert II, and his power increased during the reign (1390–1406) of his ineffective elder brother Robert III. He then became regent whilst James I was held captive in England. After Albany's death in 1420, the Scots paid a ransom to release James. James returned in 1424 determined to bring his kingdom to heel; one of his first acts was to execute most of Albany's heirs. Albany's grandson James Mór rebelled, attacking Dumbarton and killing the King's uncle John Stewart of Dundonald, but was driven into exile in Ireland and died in 1429. Throughout the 15th century the Lords of the Isles attempted to increase their influence over the mainland of Scotland at the expense of the Scottish kings in Edinburgh. In particular, the second Lord, Donald claimed the Earldom of Ross through his marriage to Mariota (Margaret), Countess of Ross. He tried to seize this vast territory by force in 1411, but this fizzled out at the Battle of Harlaw near Inverurie. Margaret's niece Euphemia inherited the title in 1402 but was persuaded in 1415 to resign it in favour of Albany's son John Stewart, Earl of Buchan. Margaret ignored the transfer and claimed that she had inherited the title on Euphemia's death in 1424, whilst Buchan's death the same year gave his first cousin King James a \\"highly dubious claim\\" to the title. However, in 1424 James confirmed Margaret as Countess of Ross. republished in 2004 by Kessinger Publishing () with a foreword by Thomas Innes In 1429 Margaret died and her son Alexander, 3rd Lord of the Isles claimed the title by inheritance from his mother. James called a Parliament at Inverness Castle in late August 1428,Some sources (based on the Scotichronicon?) say 1427, but they may be confused with the Perth Parliament of 1427, the RPS would appear definitive on this point. at which Alexander, Margaret and 'nearly all the notable men of the north' were arrested. One theory is that James wanted to replace Alexander with his uncle John Mór as Lord of the Isles, but he was forced to release Alexander either as a result of John's death in 1429 – cited by Barrell (2000), who notes that the traditional timeline has John Mor dead by 1427. or as a precondition set by John before he would negotiate. Some sources say Alexander was imprisoned for a few weeks, others say for a year; three other chiefs were executed. Campaign This leads to the suggestion that John's son Donald Balloch stirred up rebellion in 1429 to avenge his father's death. However Alexander will have wanted to make a show of force in Ross following his wife's death, and his imprisonment in Inverness gave him a particular reason to take revenge on that town. His great-nephew's Raid on Ross in 1491 provides a possible template – capture the garrison at Inverness, then head north to ravage the lands of royalist sympathisers in Ross. Tradition has it that Alexander led an army of \\"upwards of 10,000 men\\". While this may well be an exaggeration by the chroniclers, the events at the Inverness Parliament appear to have forged an unusual coalition between clans such as the Camerons and the Chattan Confederation (Clan Mackintosh), who had been feuding for over a century. However, the islanders failed to secure help from England, which would have made the revolt much more serious for James. James I It seems that Alexander marched up the Great Glen to Inverness, where he burnt the city and besieged the castle, but failed to capture it. Without the logistics to support such a great army for long in the field, he seems to have started heading back for home in the west. The King gathered an army and set off in pursuit. Battle The Royalists appear to have caught the clansmen by surprise on a moor or \\"marshy ground\\" somewhere in Lochaber, the district around Fort William at the western end of the Great Glen. The exact location is not known, and there is also some uncertainty about the date of the battle. Traditionally it was on 23 June 1429, the \\"vigil\\" (i.e. day before) of the feast day of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist but some modern sources say 26 June. Faced by the Royalist forces, the Camerons under Donald Dubh defected from their feudal overlord to the Crown. Another theory is that the MacMartin Camerons went over to the King but not the Camerons of Lochiel, hence the Camerons know this battle as the \\"Battle of Split Allegiances\\". The Mackintoshes also switched sides. History does not record whether these changes of mind required inducements from James. However, soon afterwards the King gave the Mackintoshes lands in Lochaber belonging to Alexander's uncle, Alexander of Lochalsh. After this loss of manpower, Alexander was either defeated in battle or fled without a fight. Aftermath Tantallon Castle, home to Alexander's second captivity. Alexander escaped to the islands and his first attempt to sue for peace was refused. So he went secretly to Edinburgh and dressed only in his shirt and drawers, he handed over his sword to James in the royal church of Holyrood Abbey on 28 August (or in early 1430). The Queen was impressed by his humility and pleaded for his life so Alexander was imprisoned again, this time in Tantallon Castle. He was released in November 1431, after the collapse of Donald Balloch's rebellion in that year. After the death of the Earl of Mar in 1435, James accepted Alexander's position in Ross and allowed him control of Inverness. One theory holds that the battle of Lochaber was a defining moment in the early history of the Clan Cameron, at that time it was more a confederation than a homogenous clan and the MacMartins' defection reflected this. In this view of history, the MacMartins were punished for their treachery by the Camerons of Lochiel, such that the MacMartin chiefs were driven into exile and the Lochiel faction took control of the clan. Donald Dubh appears to have supported James in his defeat at the Battle of Inverlochy in 1431 and the Cameron lands were ravaged afterwards. When Alexander was released, he took further vengeance on the clan he viewed as traitors, driving Donald Dubh into exile and giving the Cameron lands in Lochiel to John Garve Maclean of Coll.

This cave is near Kazerun in the Chogan valley, which was the site of polo (Persian čōgān چُوگان), in the Sasanian period. In the cave, on the fourth of five terraces, stands the statue of Shapur I, the second ruler of the Sasanid Empire. The statue was carved from one stalagmite. The height of statue is 7 metres and its shoulders are 2 m wide, and its arms are 3 m long. About 1400 years ago, after the Arab invasion of Iran and collapse of the Sasanian Empire, the statue was pulled down and a part of one of its legs was broken. About 70 years ago, again, parts of his arms were also broken in an earthquake. The statue had been lying on the ground for about 14 centuries until 1957 when Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran, had a group of Iranian military to raise it again on its feet and repair the broken foot with iron and cement. The project of raising the statue, building the roads from Bishapur to the area and paths in the mountain, stairs and iron fences on the route to the cave took six months in 1957. The length of cave entrance is about 16 metres, with a height of less than 8 m. Behind the statue, in the depth of the cave, are three ancient water-basins. At both sides of the statue, the rock-walls of the cave were prepared for reliefs by leveling, but the reliefs were never made. It is said that in addition to the Shapur I statue the tomb of Shapur I is also located somewhere in this cave. Another legend holds that Shapur, being defeated in a battle, ran into this cave and became lost and his body/remains have never been recovered. There are two inscriptions in the cave, one translates Shapur's own inscription on the Naqsh-e Rajab. The other is about the restoration of the statue by the army.

History  According to history, Farsunds Avis was born thanks to a misprint.About Farsunds Avis (in Norwegian) The now defunct radical newspaper Lister (1873–1934) reported from a meeting in Farsund held by the Conservative Party of Norway. Officials from the Church were also present, and the newspaper undeliberately named them «presteskrap» instead of «presteskap». The single r changed the meaning completely in Norwegian, from «clergy» to «clergy rubbish». The people of the upper class in Farsund were fed up and founded their own newspaper on 15 June 1889. Consul P. Sundt was the founding father and Farsunds Avis's first chairman. In the 1970s, Farsunds Avis started offset printing and became a daily newspaper. The newspaper went from broadsheet to compact format 9 March 2002, and in May 2014 it changed name from Farsunds Avis to Lister, to clearly mark that it covers the whole region, and not just the Farsund area. The paper edition was also reduced from six to four days per week. Lister is a conservative, but politically independent newspaper.

The venue of an upcoming Hamfest India is decided by the General Body of the last Hamfest India. The event is an excellent occasion for Hams and SWLs to meet each other and to keep updated on latest developments. It usually has technical sessions, presentations, exhibitions, demonstrations, sales of radio equipment and a flea market. The event also propose to create more awareness on Ham Radio. ‘Hamfest India' is precisely the largest gathering of Indian HAMs in one place. How it all began The idea of a generally accepted yearly convention was conceived in the South and both the earliest of its kind were organised in Kerala. The story unfolds with the formation of 'All Kerala Amateur Radio Clubs' Coordination Committee' which was decided in a meeting of Amateur Radio operators from Kerala. The meeting was held at Kottayam on 15 July 1991. This was convened jointly by OM Dr Jayakumar VU2JKR, OM Sharma VU2LV and OM Natan VU2KGN. It was intended to discuss various issues regarding promotion of Amateur Radio in Kerala. The meeting appointed a three members ‘Kerala Amateur Radio Clubs Coordination Committee’, in which OM Joseph Mattappally VU2JIM, OM V A Joseph VU2JLX and OM K V Jose VU2JKV were members. The strategy, the Committee members adopted was working for the promotion of Ham Radio in all its dimensions, addressing all practical difficulties Hams face, thus bringing all active Hams under one umbrella. That was the motivation behind the launching of Ham Information Net (Hinet), which the committee initiated on Sunday 11 August 1991. The Net frequency was 7065 KHz. and the timing was 8 AM to 8.30 AM on all Sundays. Joseph VU2JLX and Jim VU2JIM controlled the Net. This AM net slowly grew into a reliable source of Amateur Radio related information from across the South and a place to discuss latest home brewing strategies. Gradually, Radio Round Tables on preselected technical topics mostly managed by OM Ravi VU2RDN became the Highlight of Hinets. The idea of organizing a Hamfest, wherein HAMs and SWLs would come individually, irrespective of their club or society and collectively work with the spirit of the hobby was the result of Hinet activities. Before long, the Co-ordination Committee found that on-the-air interactions are not enough. So a get together was planned. Field days, at that time, were mostly limited to eyeballs, a few antenna/propagation experiments, some activity demos, food and chats. The idea was to share shack management techniques like PCB making, soldering, coil/transformer winding, modules assembling, mounting ICs, SWR matching, antenna designing, BFO tuning, operational etiquettes and much more…. After prolonged open discussions, Kerala Amateur Radio Clubs Coordination Committee, decided to make this a two days event and OM Joseph Mattappally VU2JIM was appointed to be the General Convener of it. Hamfest ‘91 (Kuttikkanam) The Hinet family could easily confirm the dates and location – 28 and 29 December 1991 at Government Guest House, Kuttikkanam. Kuttikkanam is a tourist hotspot aside a misty mountain plantation township in Idukki district, situated at an elevation of 3,500 feet above the sea level on Kollam–Theni National Highway, near Thekkady. Discussions went on for a befitting name for this event. A lot of proposals like ‘Home brewers’ Meet’ and ‘Hams’ Festival’ came up for deliberation. As the event closed in, the name became ‘Hamfest’ and finally ‘Hamfest 91’. Because of the initial overall limitations (esp. in camp capacity) and this being a typical fresh experiment, the committee accommodated only just 38 early registrants in the camp. One of the decisions of the organizers was that the merits of this event should not be attributed to any single person or group; Hamfest ’91 wasn’t a one man/group show either. It was this general attitude that made Hamfest different. Still, Hams like Joseph VU2JLX, Ravi VU2RDN, Gopi VU2EGM and Mukund VU2DRL deserve special mention for their powerful involvement and support. Not only those who attended the Fest but many who could not attend the same also deserve to be appreciated for the encouragement the organizers received. Precisely, Hamfest was the result of the burning thirst of South Indian Amateur Radio enthusiasts to unite and grow. It was this revived spirit of unity that actually served as the energy behind the success of Hamfest ‘91 and the force that paved the way to its transition into Hamfest India later. The first Hamfest began with a welcome session in Pius 10th Higher Secondary School, Kuttikkanam at 11 AM on 28 December 1991. It was late OM Madhava Menon VU2MAH from Kollam, the oldest Ham present there, who presided over the welcome session. After the introductory session in the School hall, all moved to the Government Guest House. The whole team, as planned before, split into various groups, some demonstrating home brewing techniques, some exhibiting working models and some holding question-answer sessions. All the 38 participants who represented the South Indian States of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, joined together to share and learn new home brewing technologies. It was an unforgettable experience! During the closing session, none could hold their appreciation for the event. It was simple, elegant and well organized, where Hams came and joined on their own standing and collectively worked in the true spirit of the hobby. The registrants were free to remit the amount of their choice towards expenses thanks to Mukund VU2DRL, Suresh VU2SUO and Mathew VU2MMA, Directors of Ham Radio Guild, who cleared all the remaining financial dues of Hamfest ‘91. Everybody wanted this event to continue every year, in the same spirit of togetherness. In the final get together, Om Gopi VU2EGM was unanimously appointed Gen. Convener for the second in this series - Hamfest 1992. The idea of HF ‘91 General Body was to keep it as an annual South Indian event. As the new Gen. Convener officially took charge, Kerala Amateur Radio Clubs’ Coordination Committee was dissolved. Early Hamfests Hamfest ‘92 went on fine at Aluva (near Kochi). The Aluva event still remains as the first model Hamfest. During Hamfest ‘92 days itself, both the upcoming Tamil Nadu and Karnataka Hamfests were sketched. As promised, Tamil Nadu came forward with OM Prem VU2RPC for Hamfest 1993 and Karnataka with OM Madhukar VU2MUD for Hamfest 1994. The Salem Hamfest 1993 also was an unforgettable event managed by OM Premchand VU2RPC. Tamil Nadu celebrated it as a unique state festival! By the time it reached Mysore in 1994 the echo had spread all over the nation and OM Madhukar VU2MUD, the General Convener of the same, had to face new challenges like accommodating more people and ideas. Hamfest became an All Indian Movement when the Mysore Hamfest General Body decided the upcoming Hamfest to be in Mumbai and appointed OM Adolf B Shephard VU2AF as General Convener for the same. The new name ‘Hamfest India’ was decided by the Hamfest ‘93 General Body. Hamfest India 1995 held in Mumbai was rich with representatives from WPC and ITU. It was organized in the real ambience of a royal hobby. Motivated by the spirit of earlier Hamfests, Kolkata took on Hamfest India 1996, with OM Avinash Misra VU2EM at the helm. It also was a magnificent and an imposing event. From Kolkata the event again came back to Kochi with OM Suresh VU2SUO as Gen. Convener. It still continues its royal journey passing the Official Gavel from one place to another, touching more corners of the nation, with only just one break in 2005.

Architectonic jewellery is a subset of Constructivist studio jewellery that makes use of architectural forms and ideas in the much smaller-scale format of jewellery. Some of the defining elements of architectonic jewellery are linearity, inclusion of geometric elements, undisguised structural elements, and use of varying depth to convey a sense of design in three dimensions rather than only two. Certain architectonic pieces include moving parts, which enables \\"extending or reconfiguring\\" the pieces by the wearer. Architectonic jewellery often incorporates materials more typically used in engineering such as stainless steel and niobium, reinforcing the association with architecture.  Development  The concept of architectonic jewellery began to emerge around the 1960s. At the time, the majority of jewellery was produced by luxury brand names such as Cartier, Bulgari, and Tiffany; these pieces were intended to serve as status symbols or investments rather than as artistic expressions. They tended to use mostly traditional precious metals and gemstones, and shied away from modern styling. Individual artisan jewellers working from smaller studios began to move away from the traditional, formal styles produced by these luxury brands. Encouraged by clientele with self-made wealth, and less formal, more modern tastes, these jewellers began to deliberately break from the stylistic limitations of old. Artisans began to create pieces based on organic textures or found objects. In this environment of innovation, some jewellers took a renewed interest in abstraction and geometry. With strong reference to the Bauhaus movement of the 1920s, these artisans created works that explored the relationship of function to form. Many, though not all, of the jewellers working in this style had architectural interests or training. The Israeli jeweller Deganit Stern Schoken, for example, was trained as an architect.  Design elements  Green jasper set in silver ring demonstrating visible structural elements. Architectonic jewellery is primarily concerned with exploring architectural principles such as scale and proportion in relation to the human body. Classical proportions such as the golden ratio may be employed, because these proportions look aesthetically pleasing when scaled up or down to be appropriate for architecture as well as for jewellery. Architectonic pieces often include linear or geometric elements, which can be scaled up or down to explore or demonstrate proportion. = Form = Visible structural elements such as settings and attachments are also an important part of the architectonic style. For example, in the silver ring with green jasper pictured, the setting holding the stone is attached to the main body of the ring in a way that visually emphasizes the attachment, rather than attempting to conceal it. This mimics certain architectural techniques where structural elements such as ceiling beams are left exposed. Brooch by Margaret De Patta showing transparent element. Many architectonic pieces include flexible or moving elements, the better to reflect the physicality of the larger objects they are drawing inspiration from. Schocken described her pieces as \\"linear machines,\\" further explaining that \\"movement plays an important part...[it] gives the brooch a life of its own even when not being worn...but when being held.\\" In 1989, Gralnick released a series of necklaces that incorporated spools, pulleys, and cranks, highlighting the physics and mechanics of movement. The architect Eva Eisler created a series of jewellery pieces in the 1990s which used only tension to hold the parts together. Liv Blåvarp contrasted hard and soft elements by stringing sculpted wood on flexible threads, permitting movement despite the hard surface of the wood. Architectonic pieces may also use varied depths to create a sense of the object as three-dimensional. For example, pieces created by Margaret de Patta, such as the brooch pictured, often include transparent elements that serve as \\"windows\\" to opaque structures lying beneath. = Materials = As a subset of modernist jewellery, architectonic jewellery frequently makes use of materials and textures not traditionally employed in crafting jewellery. Stainless steel and niobium are reminiscent of industrial design. Designer Lisa Gralnick made use of black acrylic sheets to create pieces that suggested missiles or submarines. Other artists have incorporated rubber, wood, concrete, plastics, and various non-precious metals to simulate architectural forms. When more traditional materials such as gold or silver are used, they are often worked in ways that produce non-traditional textures. For example, English jeweler Gerda Flockinger would melt down the surfaces of her pieces to create unusual textures typically not seen in traditional jewellery. A 1999 article in Modern Silver magazine described how Patricia Tormey \\"slammed molten gold between layers of textured charcoal and dropped it into a tray of lentils.\\" Michael Becker was known to file or score the surfaces of his brooches to emphasize his architectural references. German-Irish jeweller Rudolf Heltzel extensively polished the surfaces of his jewellery as a visual reference to industrial engineering. Overall, the objective is to produce innovative and abstract textures that reminded the viewer of industrial processes and architecture.
