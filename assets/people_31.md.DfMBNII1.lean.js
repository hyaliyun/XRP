He was a Liberal Party member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Maryborough from 1909 to 1915 and a Commonwealth Liberal Party and then Nationalist Party member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1915 until his death. Early life and business career Corser was born at Upton Cressett, near Birmingham in England, and was educated in Worcester. He migrated to Brisbane, Queensland with his family in 1864 and worked for three years on the Maryborough Sugar Company's plantation. He then worked as a clerk for the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, variously stationed in Maryborough, Brisbane and Gayndah, rising to become acting manager of the Gayndah branch at the age of 21. In 1872, he opened his own wholesale merchant business, Corser and Co. Ltd., which became a \\"large commercial establishment\\" at Maryborough selling wine, spirits and general merchandise, and continued to be managed by one of his sons after he entered politics. Corser was a co- founder and president of the Maryborough Chamber of Commerce, a long-serving member and nine-year chairman of the Burrum Divisional Board, president of the Maryborough Harbour Board, president of the Western Railway Association, one of the original shareholders of the Maryborough Co-operative Dairy Association Ltd., and was a member and president of the Maryborough Grammar School board and local hospitals' committee. As a prominent local figure prior to his entry into politics, he championed the construction of the Nanango railway line, Gayndah railway line and the failed Port of Urangan project. He was a supporter of both Federation and the White Australia Policy and was a strong protectionist. Political career In 1909, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland as the member for the multi-member seat of Maryborough, and when it became a single-member seat in 1912 was re-elected by only 10 votes. A by-election was ordered, which he was eventually declared to have won by 2 votes; a further challenge did not proceed for procedural reasons. He was defeated at the 1915 state election. His son, Bernard Corser, sat in the Legislative Assembly along with him as the member for Burnett. In 1915, as the candidate of the conservative Commonwealth Liberal Party, he transferred to federal Parliament by winning the 1915 Wide Bay by-election caused by the resignation of Labor Prime Minister Andrew Fisher. In 1917, together with the rest of his party, he became a Nationalist. He was re-elected with increasingly large majorities over time, and polled the largest majority of his career at his final election. Corser died unexpectedly in his sleep at his family's Maryborough home, \\"Eskdale\\", in 1928 while still a serving MP. His funeral was held in St Mary's Church and he was buried in Maryborough Cemetery. His son, Bernard Corser, won the by-election for his seat; Bernard had previously served alongside his father in the Queensland Legislative Assembly.Cemeteries Online ‚Äî Fraser Coast Region Council Grave Location Search.

Created by writer Dave Wood and artist Sheldon Moldoff, he first appeared in Batman #121 (February 1959) as the ice-based criminal Mr. Zero, but he was soon renamed \\"Mr. Freeze\\". Years later, his origin story was revamped to match the one conceived by writer Paul Dini for Batman: The Animated Series. Dr. Victor Fries was a cryogenics expert in Gotham City who was caught in a laboratory mishap while attempting to cure his terminally ill wife, Nora; the accident drastically lowered his body temperature to sub-zero levels, forcing him to wear a cryogenic suit in order to survive. Freeze‚Äôs main goal remains finding a cure for his wife‚Äôs illness, though his methods often bring him into conflict with Batman. This depiction of Mr. Freeze has since endured as one of the superhero Batman's most recurring enemies and belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up his central rogues gallery. The character has been portrayed in live-action by George Sanders, Otto Preminger, and Eli Wallach in the Batman television series; by Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 1997 film Batman & Robin; and by Nathan Darrow on the Fox crime series Gotham. He has also been voiced by Michael Ansara in the DC animated universe, by Clancy Brown in The Batman, and by Maurice LaMarche in the Batman: Arkham video game franchise. IGN's list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time List ranked Mr. Freeze as #67. Character overview Originally called Mr. Zero, he was renamed and popularized by the 1960s Batman television series, in which he was played by three different actors. Nearly 30 years later, a television adaptation of Batman revitalized him once again. Batman: The Animated Series retold Mr. Freeze's origin in \\"Heart of Ice\\", an episode by writer Paul Dini. The episode introduced his terminally ill, cryogenically frozen wife Nora, which explained his obsession with ice and need to build a criminal empire to raise research funds. This more complex, tragic character was enthusiastically accepted by fans, and has become the standard portrayal for the character in most forms of media, including the comic book series itself, which previously had the character casually killed off by the Joker. Freeze was resurrected in the comic after the episode aired. The episode was seen as groundbreaking for a Saturday morning cartoon and helped set the tone for the rest of the series. This backstory was also made canon in the comics and has been the character's official origin in almost every incarnation of Batman until September 2011, when The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. Elements of this origin story were incorporated into the 1997 film Batman & Robin, in which he was portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Fictional character biography The character's first appearance as \\"Mr. Zero\\" in Batman #121 (Feb. 1959); art by Curt Swan From the time of his first appearance in 1959, Mr. Freeze was portrayed as one of many \\"joke\\" villains (see also Killer Moth) cast as stock enemies of Batman. He was originally called Mr. Zero in the comics, but the producers of the 1960s Batman television series renamed him Mr. Freeze and portrayed Batman addressing him as \\"Dr. Art Schivel\\", and the name quickly carried over to the comic books. The actors who portrayed Mr. Freeze were George Sanders, Otto Preminger, and Eli Wallach. In the Pre-Crisis continuity, it is explained that Mr. Freeze is a rogue scientist whose design for an \\"ice gun\\" backfires when he inadvertently spills cryogenic chemicals on himself, resulting in him needing sub-zero temperatures to survive. =Modern Age= Freeze was revamped using a history similar to the one created by Paul Dini for Batman: The Animated Series. Dr. Victor Fries, Ph.D. (surname pronounced \\"freeze\\") was a brilliant cryogenicist. As a child, he was fascinated with cryonic preservation, so he begins freezing animals. His parents are horrified by his \\"hobby\\" and send him to a strict boarding school, where he is miserable and feels detached from humanity. In college, he meets a woman named Nora, whom he ultimately marries. Nora contracts a fatal illness 1¬Ω years after Bruce Wayne becomes Batman, so Fries begins developing a freeze ray for GothCorp in order to preserve her in suspended animation until a cure can be found. Fries' boss Ferris Boyle decides to tell the mob about the gun, leading Batman to create a team of specialists to help him do his job better. As Fries puts Nora in suspended animation, Boyle interrupts and tampers with the experiment, resulting in an explosion that kills Nora. Fries survives, but the chemicals in the freeze ray lower his body temperature to the point that he must wear a cryogenic suit in order to survive. He swears revenge on those responsible for the death of his wife (whom he talks to often), and becomes Mr. Freeze, the first superpowered villain whom Batman faces in this continuity. Eventually, Batman's operatives find Freeze, who shoots one of them with his freeze gun, but Batman eventually apprehends him. Initially locked in Arkham Asylum, Freeze was eventually transferred to the Gotham State Penitentiary, from where he escaped and attempted to steal technology from S.T.A.R. Labs until he was stopped and returned to prison by Batman.Detective Comic #595 Freeze's crimes tend to involve freezing everyone and everything that he encounters so he never forges alliances with the other criminals in Gotham, preferring to work alone. On rare occasions, he has worked with another member of Batman's rogues gallery, usually as an enforcer for Gotham's mob bosses, such as the Penguin during his reign Detective comics #804‚Äì806 or Black Mask during the return of Jason Todd.Batman #635Batman #836 In one of his notable team-ups, Freeze constructs a cryogenic machine for Hush so that Hush might take revenge on Batman, Freeze's equipment allowing Hush to preserve Catwoman's surgically removed heart to use as a means of threatening her life.Detective Comics #850 After Batman's death, most of the Arkham inmates were freed by a new Black Mask. Freeze was among them and he started working on a project called Ice-X Protocol when the GCPD tried to capture him. He stunned them with his gun and captured Gordon, taking him to his secret lair. Gordon managed to break free and defeat Freeze by causing an explosion that weakened Freeze. After his capture, Freeze was taken to Iron Heights prison.Battle for the Cowl: Commissioner Gordon #1 During his time with the Secret Society of Super Villains, he fashions a sub-zero machine for Nyssa al Ghul in exchange for the use of her Lazarus Pit. He attempts to restore Nora to life without waiting for the adjusting needed in the pool chemicals; she returns to life as the twisted Lazara and escapes. She blames her husband for her plight, and she estranges herself from him.Batgirl #69‚Äì70 =The New 52= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, during the Night of the Owls crossover, the Court of Owls sends assassins known as Talons to kill 40 of the most important citizens of Gotham, including Mr. Freeze. The Red Hood, Starfire and Arsenal choose to save him, and subsequently remand him into Batgirl's custody. Batman Annual (vol. 2) #1 introduces a new origin for Mr. Freeze. Here, Victor Fries' fascination with cryonics began when he was a boy and his mother fell through the ice of a frozen lake. The ice was able to keep her preserved long enough for help to arrive, thus sparking his lifelong obsession with the cold. It is later revealed that the accident left Fries' mother in constant pain, and Fries ended her suffering by pushing her into the same frozen lake. In this new origin, Nora was never Fries' wife. Her name was Nora Fields, a woman born in 1934. When Nora was 23, she was diagnosed with incurable heart disease, so her family placed her in cryogenic stasis hoping that a cure would be found in the future. Fries, having written his doctoral thesis on Nora, took on a position as a cryogenic researcher and technician at Wayne Enterprises, the facility that housed Nora's body. Eventually, he fell in love with Nora and became dedicated to finding a reliable method for slowly thawing cryogenic subjects. However, Bruce Wayne ordered the project to be shut down, as he began to feel uncomfortable with Fries' obsession with Nora. Furious, Fries hurled a chair at Wayne, who dodged the attack; the chair smashed into an array of cryonic chemical tanks, the contents of which sprayed onto Fries and transformed him into Mr. Freeze. The Court of Owls uses Freeze's cryogenic-thaw formula to revive their Talons, and then they try to kill him. Freeze survives but is captured by the Red Hood and sent to Arkham Asylum. He escapes shortly afterward and rearms himself with the Penguin's help. Freeze decides to kill Bruce Wayne and takes Nora, whom he believes to be his wife so that they can leave Gotham City behind forever. Infiltrating Wayne Enterprises, Freeze has a brief fight with Nightwing and Robin, but he subdues them. Then, Freeze goes to the penthouse, where he finds Batman and the frozen Nora. Batman defeats Mr. Freeze by injecting his suit with the thawing formula, which he had intended to use to revive Nora from suspended animation. During the Forever Evil storyline, Mr. Freeze appears as a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains at the time when the Crime Syndicate arrived from their world. The Scarecrow later visits Mr. Freeze to let him know of the war going on at Blackgate Penitentiary. The Man-Bats are able to bring the remaining Talons to Mr. Freeze after Man-Bat and Scarecrow steal them from Blackgate. Mr. Freeze and Clayface later encounter the Rogues when they land in their territory. Mr. Freeze tells Mirror Master II he is not interested in capitalizing on the bounty on their heads, only to use Weather Wizard to create optimal conditions for him to freeze Gotham. As the Rogues are fighting the two, Black Mask (alongside his False Face society) arrives to capture the Rogues to receive the bounty. =DC Rebirth= In the Watchmen sequel Doomsday Clock, Mr. Freeze is among the villains that attend the underground meeting held by Riddler that talks about the Superman Theory. When Comedian crashes the meeting, Mr. Freeze's helmet is punctured by a bullet shot by an unseen combatant.Doomsday Clock #6 (July 2018). DC Comics. In the \\"Ends of the Earth\\" story arc of All-Star Batman, Freeze has awoken many people that have been held in cryogenic stasis‚Äîusing them as an army to steal resources for his research to cure his wife Nora, himself, and all of these people‚Äîand plans to release deadly bacteria held in one of the world's oldest ice cores to make a new world, but Batman has injected himself with a cold- resistant virus that becomes airborne when his skin is exposed and is able to kill the spores.All-Star Batman #7 (2017). DC Comics. Several years later due to the events in \\"Year of the Villain,\\" Lex Luthor gives Mr. Freeze a vial that would cure and furthermore revive his frozen wife. Mr. Freeze had to kidnap several women who matched his late wife's characteristics, in both mental and physical states, going as far as modifying their DNA to hers in order to experiment with the vial before reviving his wife. In the end, it worked and his wife came back to life cured. She soon took up the name Mrs. Freeze. Powers and abilities Like most Batman villains, Mr. Freeze plans his crimes about a specific theme; in his case, ice, snow and cold. He freezes areas around him using special weapons and equipment, most notably a handheld \\"freeze gun,\\" and his refrigeration power suit grants him superhuman strength and durability, making him a powerful villain in Batman's rogues' gallery. In the Underworld Unleashed storyline, the demon Neron grants Mr. Freeze the ability to generate subzero temperatures, no longer needing his freeze gun or refrigeration power suit. However, after his encounter with Green Lantern, Donna Troy, and Purgatory in Central Park, he reverted to his original subzero biology. He then gained a new subzero armor and weaponry. Other versions=Smallville= Mr. Freeze appears in the comic book adaptation of Smallville, partnered with the Prankster of Intergang. He agrees to work for Intergang in order to fund Nora's treatment. Freeze is betrayed by Prankster, however, and is defeated by Batman and Green Arrow. =Robot Mr. Freeze= In Blackhawk, Mr. Freeze appears as a robot that is controlled by Doctor Thurman. =Justice League Adventures= Based in the DC Animated Universe, Mr. Freeze is part of a group of ice-themed villains called the \\"Cold Warriors\\" that tried to overthrow a small African nation. The Cold Warriors appear in Justice League Adventures #12 (December 2002).Justice League Adventures #12 (December 2002) =DC Super Friends= Based in the DC Super Friends universe, Mr. Freeze is part of a group of ice-themed villains called the \\"Ice Pack\\" that encased a city in ice and snow. The Ice Pack appears in DC Super Friends #16 (August 2009).DC Super Friends #16 (August 2009) =Flashpoint= In the alternate timeline of Flashpoint, Mr. Freeze attacks the S.T.A.R. Labs in Central City to find a cure for his wife Nora. However, Citizen Cold attacks and uses his cold gun to freeze Mr. Freeze's body. Mr. Freeze tries to escape on robotic legs, but Citizen Cold freezes him to death and tells him that Nora is dead.Flashpoint: Citizen Cold #1 (June 2011) This version of Mr. Freeze is a friend of Fallout's and pursues revenge against Citizen Cold for murdering him.Flashpoint: Citizen Cold #2 (July 2011) It is later revealed that radiation produced by Fallout is the cure Mr. Freeze was searching for.Flashpoint: Citizen Cold #3 (August 2011) =Swamp Thing= During the Rotworld storyline where Swamp Thing traveled to an alternate Earth afflicted by a mutating plague, Mr. Freeze was mentioned to be an inmate in Arkham, not making attempts to escape out of Batman's false claims of implanting him with explosives. =Injustice: Gods Among Us= In the Injustice: Gods Among Us reality, despite his cell still being kept cold for him, Freeze did not stay locked inside Arkham after clashing with Batman. Instead, he remained surprisingly low-key during Superman's Regime, remaining in hiding for five years before being captured by Killer Croc. Detained in a prison in the sewers of Gotham, Freeze was soon rescued by Harley Quinn and her Joker Clan.Injustice: Ground Zero #4 =Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles= In the crossover comic, Mr. Freeze was mutated into a humanoid mutant polar bear by Shredder. =Batman: White Knight= Victor Fries appears in the 2017 series Batman: White Knight. In this series, Victor Fries has retired from his criminal lifestyle to focus on curing his wife's disease. It is later revealed that, due to his unique, cryogenically-dependent physiology, Fries's aging had been slowed considerably, and that his father was a member of the Nazi SS during the Second World War, but acted as a double agent, allowing America to stay one step ahead of Germany on the scientific front. As a result of this, a massive freeze cannon was constructed beneath a lighthouse off the coast of Gotham City. The superweapon is discovered by Neo-Joker (the second Harley Quinn who felt that by taking pills to retain his sanity, Jack Napier was destroying the most beautiful part of himself) and is used to freeze most, if not all, of Gotham. Freeze is able to reverse the effects with the aid of Batgirl. It is also revealed that Fries had been contacted by Batman in an attempt to secure the villain's aid to save the life of Alfred Pennyworth, but unfortunately, their efforts were in vain. Reception The character of Mr. Freeze has been analyzed as a stereotypical depiction of a villainous European in fiction.Georg Drennig, \\"Otherness and the European as Villain and Antihero in American Comics,\\" in Comics as a Nexus of Cultures, eds. Mark Berninger, Jochen Ecke, and Gideon Haberkorn (Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland & Company, 2010) 131-132. In other media=Television=Live- action * Mr. Freeze appeared in the 1960s Batman television series, portrayed by George Sanders in the first two-part appearance, Otto Preminger in the second two-part appearance, and Eli Wallach in the third two-part appearance. Sanders and Wallach used German accents for the role while Preminger used his own Austrian accent. While the George Sanders version wore the classic refrigerated suit, the Otto Preminger and Eli Wallach versions wore a \\"Freeze Collar\\" around their neck that went with Mr. Freeze's cooling suit. Before Mr. Freeze was on the series, he was always called Mr. Zero. In this version, he continues to be campy like the comic books and is given an alias of \\"Dr. Art Schivel\\". In his first appearance \\"Instant Freeze\\", it is revealed that it was Batman who spilled the cryogenic chemicals on Schivel during an attempted arrest. Freeze ends up stealing diamonds from the Gotham City Diamond Exchange. When Batman and Robin try to stop him, he freezes them with his freeze gun. In the next episode \\"Rats Like Cheese\\", Mr. Freeze kidnaps Paul Diamante of the Gotham City Eagles and offers to return his hostage in exchange for Batman. Batman and Robin save Diamante and apprehend Freeze. During this appearance, Mr. Freeze's hideout has \\"warm lights\\" so that his henchmen can interact with him. In the episode \\"Green Ice\\", Mr. Freeze escapes from prison and captures Miss Iceland from the finals of the Miss Galaxy Pageant. In the next episode \\"Deep Freeze\\", Mr. Freeze has led all of Gotham City to believe that Batman has given in to his bribes. Batman and Robin managed to find Freeze's hideout, rescue Miss Iceland, and defeat Freeze before he can freeze all of Gotham. Batman arranges for Warden Crichton to have a special refrigerated cell made for Mr. Freeze. In the episode \\"Ice Spy\\", Mr. Freeze kidnaps Icelandic scientist Professor Isaacson in order to obtain an \\"Instant Ice\\" formula. In the episode \\"The Duo Defy\\", Mr. Freeze finally obtains the \\"Instant Ice\\" formula and ends up building a large freeze ray. He is thwarted by Batman and Robin again. As he is taken away by the police, Freeze tells the police officers not to touch the Freeze Collar's dials. * Mr. Freeze appears in Gotham, portrayed by Nathan Darrow. In this version, his surname is pronounced \\"\\". As in the comics, he is a scientist who researches cryogenic technology to find a cure for his wife Nora's terminal illness. To this end, he freezes Gotham's citizens with a cryogenic gun and uses them as test subjects. Horrified at what Victor has become, Nora indirectly kills herself during one of the experiments (replacing a perfected coolant with a failed, lethal formula). Devastated, Fries attempts suicide by turning the coolants from his gun on himself. He survives, however, and is rendered unable to survive outside of sub-zero temperatures. Hugo Strange has him declared dead and takes him to Arkham Asylum's Indian Hill Laboratory, where he uses him as an \\"assistant\\" in experiments with cryogenically frozen bodies. Strange also dispatches him to kill Karen Jennings, one of his former test subjects. In the season finale, \\"Wrath of the Villains: Transference\\", Strange orders Fries to kill Selina Kyle, but Bridgit Pike, another of Strange's genetically altered minions, interferes. She and Fries do battle, he with his freeze ray and she with her flamethrower; they accidentally incapacitate Strange when he gets in the crossfire. In the episode \\"Heroes Rise: The Primal Riddle\\", crime bosses Oswald Cobblepot and Ivy Pepper find Fries in an Arctic location. They persuade him to help Cobblepot in his revenge on a fellow criminal Edward Nygma by returning his special suit to him that they took from Wayne Enterprises and promising to cure his condition. In the episode \\"Heroes Rise: Destiny Calling\\", Fries assists mobster Fish Mooney with obtaining an antidote to a virus engineered by Jervis Tetch, and fighting ninja sent by the League of Shadows. After Mooney's death, Fries, Pike, and Strange are arrested by the police, but Cobblepot arranges their release. In the episode \\"Heroes Rise: Heavydirtysoul\\", Cobblepot has Fries use his freeze gun on Nygma in order to turn him into a frozen \\"centerpiece\\" for the Iceberg Lounge. In the episode, \\"A Dark Knight: The Demon's Head\\", after Nygma is freed from his icy prison, Cobblepot summons Freeze to put him back on the ice, but when he realizes that he is no longer the Riddler or Ed Nygma anymore, Cobblepot decides to spare him. In the episode, \\"A Dark Knight: The Sinking Ship, The Grand Applause\\", Fries is recruited to join Jerome Valeska's \\"Legion of Horribles\\", along with Tetch, Scarecrow, Pike, Cobblepot, and Solomon Grundy. In \\"A Dark Knight: Mandatory Brunch Meeting\\", he attends the Legion of Horribles' mandatory brunch meeting, where Jerome assigns him to find a big laboratory. In \\"A Dark Knight: That's Entertainment\\", Fries and Tetch bring back a hostage for Scarecrow to test his new laughing toxin. In the season finale, \\"A Dark Knight: No Man's Land\\", after Jeremiah Valeska blows up all bridges that lead out of the city, Gotham is labeled as a \\"no man's land\\", with villains, including Fries, claiming territory across the city. In Season 5, it's mentioned that Mr. Freeze's gang is at war with Firefly's gang where they each occupy Burnley. * Victor Fries is mentioned by Dr. Thomas Snow as one of his scientist contacts in The Flash episode \\"The Icicle Cometh\\" of the show's fifth season. The freeze gun later appears in the \\"Elseworlds\\" crossover, used by his wife Nora. Animation * Mr. Freeze appeared in The Batman/Superman Hour, voiced by Ted Knight. The Filmation series has Mr. Freeze make extensive use of his self-made technology such as making certain parts of his hideout \\"warm corridors\\" to accommodate his underlings. This version of Freeze was shown as having a specific dependence on ice; being exposed to any temperature hotter than ‚àí50 degrees Fahrenheit would kill him. * Mr. Freeze was originally supposed to be featured in the Challenge of the Super Friends season of Super Friends as a member of the Legion of Doom. However, due to Filmation's The New Adventures of Batman production at that time, Mr. Freeze was restricted to appear in the second show. He was eventually replaced with Captain Cold. * Mr. Freeze appears in The New Adventures of Batman episode \\"The Deep Freeze\\", voiced by Lennie Weinrib. Unlike his appearance in the show's opening credits, Mr. Freeze is shown without the helmet that goes with his freeze suit. He and his henchman Professor Frost plot to steal the N-1000 (a superfast submarine) to pull off the \\"Crime of the Century\\". When Batman and Robin raid his hideout, Mr. Freeze manages to freeze both of them and takes Robin with him as he escapes. When Freeze and Professor Frost steal the N-1000, they steer it to the North Pole. When Batman, Robin and Bat-Mite face Mr. Freeze and Professor Frost at the North Pole, Batman and Robin fire a beam that reverses the polarity of Freeze's freeze gun so that it warms up. They then apprehend Freeze and Professor Frost where they are both placed into prison. * Mr. Freeze appears in several series for the DC Animated Universe, voiced by Michael Ansara. ** The character first appears in Batman: The Animated Series with a design created by Hellboy creator Mike Mignola as per request of series creator Bruce Timm. Dr. Victor Fries was a scientist working for GothCorp who embezzled funds to cryogenically freeze his terminally ill wife Nora until a cure could be found for her condition. When GothCorp's corrupt CEO Ferris Boyle interfered, Fries was accidentally exposed to beakers of cryogenic chemicals, mutating him into a metahuman unable to live outside of sub-zero conditions and forcing him to wear a cryogenic suit to survive. Introduced in the Emmy Award-winning episode \\"Heart of Ice\\" (for Outstanding Writing in an Animated Program), Mr. Freeze attempts to exact vengeance against Boyle for the accident, leading to his first confrontation with Batman. After Batman discovers the truth about Freeze's tragic past, he leaves both Freeze and Boyle to be taken into police custody; Batman presents evidence of Boyle's crimes involving Nora to the press and Freeze is imprisoned in a special Arkham Asylum cell kept at sub-zero temperatures. Mr. Freeze later appears in \\"Deep Freeze\\". After being kidnapped by a giant robot and brought to the off- shore city of Oceana, he meets billionaire amusement park designer Grant Walker, who seeks to become immortal like Freeze and create a frozen world for selected residents. Freeze agrees to help when Walker promises to cure Nora, but Batman and Robin arrive and manage to convince Freeze that if he were to help Walker, Nora would resent him. Freeze eventually turns on Walker and overloads Oceana's power core to destroy the city, and stays behind with Nora and Walker. The ending reveals that they all survive, trapped in icebergs. ** Mr. Freeze appears in the direct-to-animated film Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero. After Nora's cryogenic chamber is shattered, Freeze kidnaps Barbara Gordon to harvest her organs to cure Nora. Freeze makes a deal with greedy former colleague Gregory Belson to help cure his wife in exchange for gold. Batman and Robin thwart his plan and Freeze is then presumed killed in the explosion of his lair on an abandoned oil rig. Wayne Enterprises then finances a surgery that saves Nora's life. Freeze is last seen at the North Pole, crying tears of joy as he learns of Nora's recovery. ** Mr. Freeze returns in The New Batman Adventures, sporting a new, sleeker design. As his mutation slowly degrades his body, Victor Fries kidnapped two scientists (voiced by Jeff Bennett and Lauren Tom) to try and stop the process, only succeeding in saving his head which is supported by four robotic legs built separately from his suit. When a cured Nora Fries married her own doctor and left Gotham permanently, the trauma destroys whatever is left of Fries' humanity. Mister Freeze vows to inflict on others the loss he has suffered in the episode \\"Cold Comfort\\" by taking away the things they value most, much to the confusion of Robin and Batgirl. When Freeze is confronted at his hideout by Batman and Batgirl, he reveals his true condition to them as well as his goal of destroying Gotham City ‚Äî all the Dark Knight holds dear ‚Äî by dropping a 'reverse fusion bomb' that will freeze the city. Freeze boards a helicopter to drop the bomb. However, he is followed by Batman and they engage in a duel in which Batman uses a grappling gun to hook Freeze to the bomb and drop it into the river, where an explosion creates a huge iceberg. Although Freeze is presumed dead, his head is seen to be missing as the episode ends. ** In Batman Beyond, several of Mister Freeze's freeze guns have been procured by the elderly Bruce Wayne and are displayed in the Batcave. The new Batman (Terry McGinnis) uses one to freeze Inque in the episode \\"Black Out\\", however, Inque destroys this one in the episode \\"Disappearing Inque\\". Another one is seen in the Batcave's background during subsequent episodes. The tragic man personally appears in the episode \\"Meltdown\\". His disembodied head is revealed to have survived for decades thanks to cryogenic technology. Wayne-Powers' CEO Derek Powers and Dr. Stephanie Lake (voiced by Linda Hamilton) use him as a test subject for a process that could cure Powers' own mutation. Transferring his mind into a clone built from his own baseline DNA, Victor Fries sees this as a second chance. Fries initially tries to right some of the wrongs he has committed by creating a charitable organization with all his legitimate earnings from before he was imprisoned, which impresses Terry. However, Victor's new body soon begins to revert to his original body's same sub-zero biology. Although Lake and Powers betray him when he returns to Wayne-Powers for help, Fries escapes. After recovering an advanced suit of sub-zero armor that fires ice blasts directly out of gauntlets equipped onto his hands, Mister Freeze seeks revenge by freezing Lake and Powers and attempting to blow up Wayne-Powers' complex to commit suicide. In the middle of his plan, Freeze battles Batman and then fights with Blight. Freeze redeems himself by saving the new Dark Knight from Blight. Batman attempts to rescue Freeze from the collapsing building, however, Freeze refuses help and presumably dies in the explosion. Mr. Freeze as he appears in The Batman. * Mr. Freeze appears in The Batman, voiced by Clancy Brown. Debuting in the episode \\"The Big Chill\\", this version of Victor Fries is a diamond thief who was accidentally electrocuted in a cryogenic laboratory chamber, transforming him into a cryokinetic metahuman capable of blasting ice with his bare hands and generating extreme cold around him; he forced a scientist to create a cryogenic suit to contain his condition. Photos of Fries' wife Nora are briefly seen in his car, but whether she is deceased or terminally ill in this continuity is unknown. In \\"Fire and Ice\\", Mr. Freeze joins forces with Firefly to attack the GCPD Christmas Gala. In \\"The Icy Depths\\", Mr. Freeze comes into conflict with the Penguin over an umbrella that hides a map to an ancient sunken treasure. In \\"Artifacts\\", it is revealed that while the immortal Mr. Freeze's powers have increased significantly in the future, he is forced to use a special exosuit due to having his lower body replaced with mechanical spider legs. In \\"Rumors\\", Mr. Freeze is among the villains captured by the eponymous vigilante. In \\"The Joining (Part 2)\\", Mr. Freeze, the Joker, Bane, and the Penguin are seen fighting the titular extraterrestrial invaders at Arkham Asylum. In \\"The Batman/Superman Story (Part 1)\\", Mr. Freeze, Black Mask, Clayface, and Bane are hired by Lex Luthor to kidnap Lois Lane as bait to lure Superman. * Mr. Freeze appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by John DiMaggio. The Mr. Zero version is featured in the episodes \\"Legends of the Dark Mite!\\", \\"Sidekicks Assemble!\\", while the Mr. Freeze version is seen in \\"Chill of the Night!\\", \\"Bold Beginnings!\\", and \\"Crisis: 22,300 Miles Above Earth!\\". * Mr. Freeze appears in Young Justice, voiced by Keith Szarabajka.

In \\"Terrors\\", Mr. Freeze joins forces with fellow ice-based villains Icicle Sr., Icicle Jr., Captain Cold, and Killer Frost in an attempt to break out of Belle Reve Penitentiary. In \\"Coldhearted\\", Mr. Freeze is briefly seen in his cell at Belle Reve. * Mr. Freeze appears in Justice League Action, voiced by Peter Stormare. In the episode \\"Freezer Burn\\", he uses an unwilling Killer Frost as a power source for the freeze gun on his airship. * DC Super Hero Girls is set to feature Mr. Freeze in one of its episodes, voiced by John de Lancie. =Film=Live- action Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze in the 1997 film Batman & Robin * Mr. Freeze appears as the main antagonist in the 1997 film Batman & Robin, portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger (who received top billing ahead of George Clooney, who portrayed Batman). In the film, Dr. Victor Fries was in an accident in a cryogenics lab he was using to find a cure for his wife Nora Fries suffering from the (fictional) terminal illness MacGregor's Syndrome and is now dependent on a diamond-powered sub-zero suit to keep cold or he would die. Mister Freeze crashes a charity event held by Wayne Enterprises and steals a diamond from the event. Mister Freeze is captured by Batman and detained at Arkham Asylum, but flees with the help of Poison Ivy and Bane. Ivy cuts off Nora's life support and deceives Mister Freeze into thinking that Batman was responsible for the deed as part of a plan to use him to freeze up Gotham City. With the use of a gigantic ray gun stationed in an observatory, he freezes over the entirety of Gotham. In a subsequent fight with Batman, Mr. Freeze destroys the observatory with a set of bombs (planted by Bane) in an unsuccessful attempt to take Batman with him. Batman shows Mr. Freeze a recording of Ivy during her fight with Batgirl in which she brags about killing Nora, revealing her real colours to him. Batman tells Mr. Freeze that his wife is not dead; she was restored and moved to Arkham, where he can complete his research. Batman asks him for the cure he created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome for Alfred Pennyworth; Mr. Freeze atones for his past actions by giving Batman the medicine he had developed. Freeze is then detained at Arkham where he exacts his revenge on Ivy for her deception and treachery. The character's penchant for cold- and ice-related puns was noted by critics. James Berardinelli of ReelViews commented that \\"Schwarzenegger, aside from looking like a cross between the Michelin Man and RoboCop, appears totally confused about what he's doing. Sometimes he's in Terminator mode; on other occasions, he's chomping on a cigar like he's back in Last Action Hero\\" despite the character's aversion to heat. He also noted that Freeze's backstory and motivation were \\"too complex for Schwarzenegger to convey effectively or for [director Joel] Schumacher to care about exploring. As a result, Mr. Freeze ends up being a frustratingly incomplete brute who's out to smother Gotham City under a blanket of ice.\\" Robin Dougherty of Salon lamented that \\"Schwarzenegger‚Äôs exuberance is pinned down. He‚Äôs like a moth squashed by an 18-wheeler. He‚Äôs also paralyzed by amazingly inert dialogue. How many lame jokes about cold can you fit into two hours? Buy a ticket and find out.\\" Patrick Stewart was considered for the role, before the script was rewritten to accommodate Schwarzenegger's casting. Schumacher decided that Mr. Freeze must be \\"big and strong like he was chiseled out of a glacier\\". Schwarzenegger was paid a $25 million salary for the role. His prosthetic makeup and wardrobe took six hours to apply each day. Animation * Mr. Freeze appears in Superman/Batman: Public Enemies. He is seen with the \\"Cold Warriors\\" Icicle Jr. (Cameron Mahkent), Killer Frost (Louise Lincoln) and Captain Cold when they are among the villains trying to claim the bounty on Superman and Batman.

He was a Nobel prize-winning thermal expert who was part of Lex Luthor's \\"Project Fair Play\\", a weapons program contingency that would be used to destroy the Justice League if necessary. Fries was measuring atmospheric carbon levels near the Arctic Circle before being murdered by a Metal Man designed by Will Magnus to frame Batman for the crime. * Mr. Freeze appears in Batman Unlimited: Mechs vs. Mutants, voiced by Oded Fehr. His origin is above the same, except this version has banished himself to the Arctic because he believes that \\"he's not fit for humanity,\\" until he is employed by Penguin to mutate Killer Croc and Chemo into giant monsters and freeze Gotham for revenge. With their plan almost complete, Penguin betrayed him by secretly giving Bane and Clayface the same formula without Freeze's knowledge. Now filled with guilt, Freeze decided to help Batman and his team stop Penguin, primarily by constructing a freeze ray that could neutralize Clayface. He nearly died in the process, having been exposed to heat while outside his subzero suit. However, Robin was able to return him to the suit, and he willingly gave himself up to the police, hoping that he could be granted solitary confinement. * Mr. Freeze made a cameo appearance in the 2016 animated film Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders (which is a continuation of the 1966 Batman TV series).

Though Barbara Gordon does a trick that causes Mr. Freeze to accidentally freeze Clayface. During the fight against the Phantom Zone inmates, Mr. Freeze and Clayface defeat the Kraken from Clash of the Titans. * Mr. Freeze appears in Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, voiced by John DiMaggio. Freeze is mutated into an anthropomorphic polar bear when Joker spreads mutagen to all of the Arkham Asylum inmates. He fights and with Damian Wayne, Raphael and Michelangelo in the kitchen before they retreat.

In it his design is based mainly on the animated series and he uses his freeze gun to freeze enemies and water. The strength granted to him by his suit allows him to pick up objects others cannot. His suit also protects him from toxins. The Riddler assigns him to get a freeze cannon in his old factory. It is shown in the story that, while he aids the Riddler in his pursuit for Gotham City's gold reserves, he is shown to be formulating plans of his own, which involve raising an army of Freeze Maids, which he uses in his boss fight. The player has to be quick and attack him right after he shuts down his freeze gun. After he is defeated, he attempts to run away, but Batman throws a Batarang at him, causing his pack to backfire and make him bounce across the room and then land on the floor in front of Batman and Robin.

Batman: Arkham * Mr. Freeze appears in the Batman Arkham series where he is voiced by Maurice LaMarche. ** In Batman: Arkham Asylum, Mr. Freeze's frost and icicle covered cell can be seen in the Penitentiary area which can be scanned to unlock his bio. According to the game's writer Paul Dini, Freeze was originally planned to be featured in the game, but his inclusion was dropped as he did not fit as part of the game. ** In Batman: Arkham City, he appears as both an ally to Batman and a boss battle. After the Joker poisons Batman, the Dark Knight has to find Mr. Freeze. Batman searches for him in the GCPD building (literally the coldest place in Arkham City), only to find his lab swarmed by the Penguin's men, who reveal that Penguin is holding Mr. Freeze hostage in the Cyrus Pinkney National History Institute. It is revealed that Penguin stole Mr. Freeze's gun and is holding GCPD officers hostage. Batman saves the hostages and Mr. Freeze from Penguin's men in the museum and asks Mr. Freeze for the cure to his ailment, only for Mr. Freeze to reveal he needs his suit, which Penguin possesses. He tells Batman that his suit has a disruptor that can be used to turn off his freeze gun so that he can defeat Penguin. After Penguin is apprehended and Mr. Freeze recovers his suit, he gets revenge by locking Penguin in a display case. Mr. Freeze then tells Batman that the cure he made for Joker degenerates too quickly and needs a restorative enzyme that has been bonded to human DNA, something that would take decades, only for Batman to reveal he knows someone who has been exposed to that enzyme for centuries. Mr. Freeze tells Batman he only needs a sample of this person's DNA to complete the cure and Batman proceeds to track down one of the warriors of the League of Assassins Penguin had captured. When Batman returns to the GCPD with the blood sample, Mr. Freeze creates two vials of the cure before locking one in a safe and destroying the other, demanding Batman save Nora Fries from Joker. Batman fights Mr. Freeze to unlock the safe, which proves difficult as Mr. Freeze is much too powerful to be confronted directly. Batman is forced to hide and find ways to stun Mr. Freeze, such as using grates in the floor to surprise him as he passes by. Each time Mr. Freeze is incapacitated, he counteracts his weaknesses. After he is beaten, Batman opens the safe only to find that the wall behind the safe was broken into and in the place of the cure there is only a note saying: \\"Get well soon!\\" and some joker cards. Batman realizes that Harley Quinn had stolen the cure while the Dark Knight was distracted fighting Mr. Freeze. Mr. Freeze gives Batman freeze grenades to help him retrieve the cure and begs him to find Nora, which becomes a side mission in the game. After Nora is saved, Batman finds Mr. Freeze with his wife and tells him to end his life of crime for Nora's sake. Mr. Freeze's boss battle was widely praised as a step up from the repetitive titan thug bosses from the previous game. ** In Batman: Arkham Origins, his origin and first encounter with Batman is featured in the DLC story \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\" which is based on the Batman: The Animated Series episode \\"Heart of Ice\\". Mr. Freeze also has a new design for the downloadable content (DLC), featuring cleated boots and a larger freeze gun built into the right arm of his suit. In the DLC, Mr. Freeze is in collaboration with the Penguin's gang in order to crash a party at Wayne Manor in order to capture Ferris Boyle. When Batman arrives at GothCorp, he finds Penguin trying to force Mr. Freeze to give him what Freeze is after (thinking it to be weapons) until Mr. Freeze uses his freeze gun to create a chain reaction that traps Penguin in a wall of ice. Upon getting the X-E suit to withstand the cold and acquiring a cryogenic drill to penetrate the ice wall, Batman finds residual evidence that Boyle was behind the accident that turned Victor Fries into Mr. Freeze and that Boyle is in possession of Mr. Freeze's cryogenically frozen wife. Batman later confronts and defeats Mr. Freeze. Boyle then takes a piece of machinery and attacks Mr. Freeze, only for Batman to knock out Boyle. During the DLC's credits, a news voiceover states that Mr. Freeze, Penguin, and Boyle have been all arrested by the police. ** Mr. Freeze is featured in Batman: Arkham Knight. Mr. Freeze's freeze gun can be found in the evidence room at the Gotham City Police Department. According to Aaron Cash, Mr. Freeze has not been seen or heard since Arkham City and implies that he possibly gave up his criminal life to continue his work on finding a cure for Nora Fries. There was also a mentioning that the freeze gun was used by some members of the Gotham City Police Department to make ice cream until it was confiscated from them by James Gordon. Mr. Freeze appears in the December \\"Season of Infamy\\" downloadable content (DLC) pack in the side mission \\"In From The Cold\\". Batman discovers a frozen vessel just off the coast of Gotham and investigates, finding Mr. Freeze at his wife's old cryogenic chamber. He says that the Arkham Knight's Militia took Nora after he refused to help Scarecrow and Arkham Knight with their plans to take down Batman. Freeze entrusts Batman to rescue his wife from the soldiers. After fighting through a barrage of Militia henchmen, Batman finds Nora and breaks her out of her damaged cryo-chamber. Much to both Batman and Freeze's surprise, she no longer wants to be frozen in ice and simply wants to spend time with Victor. It is also revealed that she could hear every word he said, despite being in suspended animation. After taking down a Militia force trying to destroy Fries' vessel, Nora and Victor meet face-to-face and Victor removes his protective helmet. As they look off at Gotham, Nora asks how long they will live, to which Victor replies \\"merely days\\". They then depart Gotham City; when Batman analyses Freeze's equipment in the GCPD lockup, a recording made by Cash ponders whether this turn of events is a happy or sad outcome for the Frieses. ** Mr. Freeze appears as a playable character in the mobile game Batman: Arkham Underworld. He is unlocked after the player completes a mission for him, after which he becomes playable, wielding his freeze gun with different firing modes. =Web series= * In the third season of the Flash series Gotham Girls, a new villain is introduced: Dora Smithy (voiced by Jennifer Hale), Mr. Freeze's sister-in-law. She blames Freeze for Nora's death and dons his freezing equipment in a quest for revenge. As a result, there is an emphasis on Mr. Freeze himself throughout the season, and he is discussed several times, although he never actually makes an appearance. * In the Batman Unlimited shorts, Mr. Freeze appears on a rampage in a giant robot suit. Batman manages to destroy the suit and Freeze ejects. Freeze then attacks Batman, only for Batman to shatter his helmet. Batman puts a gas mask on him and handcuffs him, comforting Mr. Freeze until the cops arrive. * Mr. Freeze appears in Harley Quinn, voiced by Alfred Molina. This version resembles his New 52 counterpart and speaks with a Spanish accent. He is first mentioned in season one, before making his first full appearance in the season two premiere \\"New Gotham\\" as a member of the Injustice League. Following the Joker destroying Gotham in the season one finale, Mr. Freeze joined forces with Bane, Riddler, Penguin, and Two-Face to form the Injustice League and seize control. When Harley interferes with their plans, they attempt to make peace with her, but she refuses due to the little territory they offer her. In response, Freeze has her frozen and put on display in Penguin's Iceberg Lounge. Over the course of the following two months, Freeze and his allies divided Gotham's ruins between them and dubbed it \\"New New Gotham\\". In the episode \\"Thawing Hearts\\", Freeze captures Harley and most of her crew when they attempt to storm his lair using Firefly's flamethrower and tries to use Harley herself to find a cure for his wife Nora. However, she convinces him to let her call Poison Ivy for help so she can find a cure. While they wait, Freeze treats Harley and her crew to dinner while he tells them how he and Nora met. Due to her mistreatment at Joker's hands however, Harley refuses to believe him and unfreezes Nora to save her, only to learn she is dying. Incensed, Freeze threatens to detonate his lair and take everyone with it unless Ivy finds a cure. While Ivy does so, she learns that due to Nora's rare blood type, someone else has to take the cure then give Nora a blood transfusion, which will kill them. Freeze opts to sacrifice himself for his wife and dies saving her. =Miscellaneous= * Mr. Freeze appears in the direct-to-video original animation DC Super Friends: The Joker's Playhouse (2010), voiced by Eric Bauza.

Biography He was born at Warsaw, New York on April 6, 1848 to Seth Merrill Gates. Gates received his baccalaureate degree at the University of Rochester, where he achieved high honors in Mathematics, Latin and Greek, and received the English Essay Prize in his senior year. He served as principal for twelve years at The Albany Academy in Albany, New York, and visited the Rugby School and the University of Oxford in England from 1872 to 1875. Upon his return to the United States, he was offered the post of Chancellor of the University of Tennessee but declined and remained in Albany. He went abroad again in 1879, spending a year in travel and study in France, Italy, Egypt, Palestine, and Greece. Upon this second return, the University of the State of New York conferred on him a degree in honoris causa in 1880, and in 1882, both the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University and the University of Rochester awarded him the degree of Doctor of Laws. He received the LL.D. degree from Columbia University in 1891 and from Williams College in 1893. Columbia University also conferred upon him the degree of Doctor of Humane Letters (L.H.D.) in 1887. During his tenure as President of Rutgers College, which began in 1882, Gates built the College's first dormitory, Winants Hall (completed in 1890) named for Garrett E. Winants, and New Jersey Hall (funded by the state), which was used for instruction in chemistry and biology (now home of the economics department). Under the provisions of the Hatch Act, in 1887, Rutgers established the Agricultural Experiment Station, and under the Morrill Act of 1890, increase funding for the scientific school. In 1890, Gates resigned as President of Rutgers University to become President of Amherst College (from 1890-1899) in Massachusetts. After his tenure at Amherst, Gates was appointed to be chairman of the Board of Indian Commissioners, and later named secretary of the board where he served from 1899 to 1912. He remained in Washington, DC presenting lectures and serving literary and philanthropic societies, and preaching in the Congregational Church. He died at his summer home in Littleton, New Hampshire on August 11, 1922, he was 74 years old.

Early life Corser was born at Maryborough in 1882 to Edward Corser and Mary Jane (n√©e Stewart). He was educated at Maryborough Christian Brothers' School, Riverview College, Sydney, and returned to Queensland to study at Queensland Agricultural College, Gatton. Politics In 1912, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland as the member for Burnett, joining the National Party on its formation in 1917. He held the seat until 1928. By 1928, Corser had joined the Country Party and was elected to the Australian House of Representatives in a by-election for the seat of Wide Bay, which was caused by the death of his father, who was then the serving Nationalist MP. In April 1939, the leader of the Country Party's senior Coalition partner the United Australia Party, Prime Minister Joseph Lyons, died, and the leader of the Country Party, Earle Page, became caretaker Prime Minister. The likely replacement for Lyons was Robert Menzies, but Page attacked him. Together with Arthur Fadden, Thomas Collins and Oliver Badman, Corser dissociated himself from Page, and when the latter resigned as leader, the four were barred from the party meeting that elected Page supporter Archie Cameron as leader. As a result, Corser and his colleagues rejected Cameron's leadership. Later life Corser retired from politics in 1954 and became a grazier.

A xerocole (), commonly referred to as a desert animal, is an animal adapted to live in the desert. The main challenges they must overcome are lack of water and excessive heat. To conserve water, they both avoid evaporation and concentrate excretions (i.e. urine and feces). Some are so adept at conserving water or obtaining it from food that they do not need to drink at all. To escape the desert heat, xerocoles tend to be either nocturnal or crepuscular, most active at dawn and dusk. Water conservation A kangaroo rat can live its entire life without ever having to drink. =Avoiding evaporation= Xerocoles have developed a variety of mechanisms to reduce water loss via evaporation. Mammalian xerocoles sweat much less than their non-desert counterparts. For example, the camel can survive ambient temperatures as high as without sweating, and the kangaroo rat lacks sweat glands entirely. Both birds and mammals in the desert have oils on the surface of their skin to \\"waterproof\\" it and inhibit evaporation. Desert insects use a similar method, as their cuticles are waxy to prevent water from escaping; however, at critical temperatures (ex. for cockroaches), the wax molecules in the cuticle rearrange to become permeable and permit evaporative cooling. Amphibious xerocoles, such as species of the frog genus Phyllomedusa, have wax-like coatings on their skin to reduce water loss. The frogs secrete lipids from glands in their skin: when their skin begins to dry out, they move their limbs over the glands on their backs, and wipe the lipids over their bodies. Other desert amphibians, such as the frog genus Cyclorana, avoid desiccation by burrowing underground during dry periods and forming a cocoon from shed skin: rather than being sloughed off, the skin remains attached to create the cocoon. As skin layers amass, water impermeability increases. During evaporation Though desert birds lack sweat glands, they can still take advantage of evaporative cooling by panting, which cools the trachea and lungs, and gular flapping, which consists of rapidly fluttering the gular skin to move air over the inner mouth and throat. Kangaroo rats and other small mammals use evaporative cooling in a similar way. When air is respired, water evaporates from the nose, cooling the surface of the nasal passages to approximately . The low temperature causes moisture to condense, partially making up for the water that was lost. The process, called respiratory heat exchange, works best when the walls of the nasal passage have a large surface area. Some animals pour bodily fluids on themselves to take advantage of evaporative cooling. Xerocole birds such as storks, New World vultures, and ibis urinate on their legs, while desert tortoises sometimes salivate on their neck and front legs to keep cool. Similarly, many rodents and marsupials lick themselves to spread saliva, though this only remains effective for a short time, and requires the fur to become very damp. =Excretion=Urine Arabian camels can survive several days and travel up to without water. One way they save water is by excreting very concentrated urine. To excrete nitrogenous waste products, mammals (and most amphibians) excrete urea diluted in water. Such xerocoles have adapted to make their urine as concentrated as possible (i.e. use the least amount of water) to dissolve urea. Desert mammals have longer and more deeply inset nephrons, as well as smaller and fewer cortical and juxtamedullary glomeruli (glomeruli being capillary networks where both fluid and waste are extracted from blood). This in turn leads to a smaller glomerular filtration rate, and on the whole, less water is transferred from the blood to the kidney. The kidneys of desert mammals are also better adapted at reabsorbing water from the tubular fluid: though there are fewer glomeruli, the xerocole has larger juxtamedullary glomeruli than cortical glomeruli (the former playing an important role in concentrating urine), whereas the opposite is true for non-xerocoles. Desert mammals also have longer loops of Henle, structures whose efficiency in concentrating urine is directly proportional to their length. The efficiency of their loops of Henle is augmented by the increased antidiuretic hormone in their blood. Desert amphibians can store more nitrogen than aquatic ones, and do so when not enough water is available to excrete the nitrogen as urea. The African reed frog can store excess nitrogen in iridophore, pigmented granules in its skin, by converting the nitrogen to guanine, which makes up the majority of the iridophores' composition. Reptiles, birds, insects, and some amphibious species excrete nitrogenous waste as uric acid rather than urea. Because uric acid is less toxic than urea, it does not need to be dissolved in water to be excreted (as such, it is largely insoluble). Feces Most animal feces are over 75% water; xerocoles, however, reabsorb water in the gut and produce much drier feces. For example, the kangaroo rat's feces contain only as much water as that of other, non-desert rodents. In insects, the rectal gland also absorbs water, and the insects excrete dry pellets. In birds, along with some other vertebrates, the ureter and rectum both lead to the cloaca, whose walls also absorb water. =Other methods= Camels can further conserve water by closing an orifice in their stomach to create two compartments: one for water and one for food. Seed-eating rodents maintain a low metabolic rate to reduce water lost to respiration (and to prevent their burrow from overheating). Rodent mothers produce concentrated milk for their young, and then eat their young's dilute urine and feces to regain some of the water that was lost. Desert canids and kangaroos eat their own young's excrement for the same reason. The Australian water-holding frog conserves water by retaining urine in the bladder, swelling up like a balloon; it then uses its bladder as a water reserve during the dry season. Alternative water sources Some antelope, such as the addax (pictured) and the oryx, are so efficient at getting water from plants that they never need to drink. Xerocoles get a substantial amount of hygroscopic water from their food. Many feed on moisture-filled plants: the aardvark obtains water from the wild cucumber and the camel eats succulents and bushes in the winter, getting enough water to go two months without drinking. The oryx eats Acacia leaves late at night, when water content is highest: in the hot, arid daytime the leaves are only 1% water; but in cooler, more humid night the leaves are 40% water. Some xerocoles are able to obtain water from halophytic (saltwater) plants, as they can metabolize high amounts of oxalic acid and produce very concentrated urine. The chisel-toothed kangaroo rat also mitigates the saltiness of the halophyte it eats (the shadscale) by using its broad, sharp lower incisors to scrape off the leaves' salty outerlayer to reach the less-salty center. Carnivores derive water from their prey's meat and blood. Insectivores, such as the aardwolf (a type of hyena) and the southern grasshopper mouse, are thus largely independent from free water. Xerocoles obtain a large percentage of their water from the metabolic processes used to break down their food. The water gained from fat is nearly twice the amount gained from carbohydrates, as the former contains more hydrogen (which determines the amount of water produced). The water gained from metabolism is more than enough to offset the water lost from evaporation in the lungs (which increases due to the need for oxygen to break down food). Thermal regulation=Morphology= Xerocoles such as the hare have large ears that help them keep cool: when the ears stand up, blood flow increases to the numerous vessels there and heat is dissipated. However, at , the cape hare near Abu Dhabi, UAE sits in the shade and drapes its ears over itself, as erecting them in such weather would absorb more heat. Desert animals have less fat than their non-desert counterparts, as fat would act as insulation, so retaining heat. What fat they do have is localized, such as in the camel's hump or the bison's neck. In terms of fur, however, desert animals have thick insulating coats that impede the conduction of heat towards the body. The coats are not uniformly distributed, but rather leave sparsely covered patches called \\"thermal windows\\" at the axilla, groin, scrotum, and mammary glands. Heat can be dissipated from thermal windows via convection and conduction. Similarly, desert birds have less feathers on the underwing and flank ‚Äì heat stress induces some birds to raise their wings, increasing the surface area of exposed skin. Birds adjust their feathers to create or dissipate an insulating layer, as typified by the ostrich. At high temperatures, the ostrich elevates its long dorsal feathers to create a barrier against solar radiation while allowing air to move across the skin's surface. In the cool nights, the feathers lower and interlock, trapping an insulating layer above the skin. Ectotherms, such as this Cunningham's spiny- tailed skink, often bask in the sun to regulate body temperature. =Burrows= Most small xerocoles live in burrows to avoid the desert heat. The burrows act as microenvironments: when they are deeper than below the surface, they maintain humidity and temperatures between , regardless of external weather. Some animals seal their burrows to keep them moist. Ectotherms also use burrows as a means to keep warm in the cold desert nights. As ectotherms are usually small and unable to store their own body heat, they quickly take on the external temperature of the environment, which necessitates controlled microenvironments. For example, while reptiles are able to operate at temperatures exceeding optima, they become sluggish when cold. As such, they spend their nights in burrows or crevices, where they create warm environments by quickly generating metabolic heat. Desert lizards usually use other animals' burrows to meet their purposes. =Circadian rhythms= All desert rodents except ground squirrels and chipmunks are nocturnal. Amphibians are usually nocturnal as well, while many other xerocoles are diurnal, but reduce activity at midday and increase in the mornings and evenings. Some xerocoles change their activity patterns depending on the season: nocturnal ants, for example, become diurnal during colder periods. Many xerocoles, especially rodents, estivate in the summer, becoming more dormant. Some desert amphibians estivate underground for over a year at a time. Unlike hibernation, which leads to a state of torpor, estivation induces lethargy, and can go unnoticed in some animals if their body temperature is not measured. Protection from the sun When the Cape ground squirrel scurries from one shady spot to the next, he holds his wide, flat tail over his back to provide shade. Xerocoles are usually light and sandy in color as a means to reflect solar radiation and reduce heat absorption. Some change color with the seasons to reflect more sunlight in the summer: addaxes change from gray-brown to nearly white. Iguanid lizards can change color on a much smaller time scale by varying melanin concentration. They become darker when burrowing and lighter when basking ‚Äì both the desert iguana and the zebra-tailed lizard become so pale that they appear to shine due to the amount of light they reflect. Most desert lizards also have a black peritoneal lining in their abdominal cavity to absorb UV radiation and prevent it from damaging internal organs. Shade under shrubbery provides resting spots for diurnal lizards, nesting sites for birds, as well as temporary oases for diurnal rodents, who skirt among shady spots. Large animals such as camels and carnivores also spend the hottest parts of the day under shade. Protection from sand Desert animals such as the camel, addax, and kangaroo rat have large feet to prevent them from sinking in the sand. The fennec fox has extra fur on the soles of its feet to give it traction and protect it from the hot sand. Most animals in arid environments are slender with long legs, giving them the speed as they travel long distances for food and water. The three main vulnerabilities against the sand are through the eyes, ears, and nose. To keep sand out of their eyes, xerocoles including reptiles and birds, and some amphibians and mammals have a nicitating membrane in their eyes: a third, transparent eyelid that protects the cornea from blowing sand and can dislodge it from the eye. Reptiles also have eyes the size of pinholes or protected by valves. To keep sand out of their ears, mammals such as the camel and the sand cat have long hairs protruding from them. The camel and the saiga antelope also have adaptations to protect their noses from sand: the former has narrow nostrils it can close, and the latter has a large nose with its nostrils set wide apart and far back to prevent sand from entering when grazing. Reptile diggers have nostrils that face upwards instead of forwards for the same reason. Speed Xerocoles, having to travel long distances for food and water, are often adapted for speed, and have long limbs, feet that prevent them from sinking in the sand, and are overall slender in form. As there is little cover to protect them from predators, desert animals also use speed as a defense mechanism. For example, a desert jackrabbit can run much faster than a coyote; as such, \\"an ordinary wolf or coyote will not attempt to chase him, for they realize the hopelessness of it.\\" Known xerocoles The following animals are known xerocoles: * Aardvark * Aardwolf * Acanthodactylus * Addax * African leopard * African lion * African savanna hare * African golden wolf * African wild ass * African wild dog * American badger * Antelope jackrabbit * Ankole-Watusi * Arabian leopard * Arabian gazelle * Arabian oryx * Arabian red fox * Arabian sand gazelle * Arabian wildcat * Arabian wolf * Arizona bark scorpion * Arizona black rattlesnake * Arizona woodpecker * Armadillo girdled lizard * Bactrian camel * Barbary sheep * Bearded dragon * Big brown bat * Big free-tailed bat * Black-tailed jackrabbit * Blanford's fox * Bobcat * Bolson tortoise * Burro * Cactus wren * Cactus mouse * Cairo spiny mouse * California leaf-nosed bat * California myotis * California quail * Cape ground squirrel * Cape hare * Caracal * Cave myotis * Cerastes cerastes * Cerastes vipera * Chipmunk * Chuckwalla * Colorado River toad * Coues' deer * Collared peccary * Common desert centipede * Common genet * Coyote * Cunningham's spiny-tailed skink * Cuvier's gazelle * Cyclorana * Desert bighorn sheep * Desert box turtle * Desert cottontail * Desert elephant * Desert hedgehog * Desert horned lizard * Desert iguana * Desert kangaroo rat * Desert kingsnake * Desert long- eared bat * Desert monitor * Desert mule deer * Desert pipistrelle * Desert pocket gopher * Desert tortoise * Dorcas gazelle * Dromedary * Echis leucogaster * Egyptian mongoose * Fennec fox * Ferruginous pygmy owl * Gemsbok * Gambel's quail * Ghost-faced bat * Giant desert centipede * Gila monster * Gila woodpecker * Grasshopper mouse * Golden jackal * Gopher tortoise * Greater long-nosed bat * Greater mouse-tailed bat * Greater roadrunner * Hamadryas baboon * Hartebeest * Honey badger * Hyperolius * Kangaroo rat * Kit fox * Lappet-faced vulture * Lesser long-nosed bat * Lesser mouse-tailed bat * Lesser roadrunner * Libyan jird * Mauritanian shrew * Meerkat * Mexican free- tailed bat * Mexican long-tongued bat * Mexican wolf * Mojave rattlesnake * Nine-banded armadillo * North African gerbil * Northwest African cheetah * Nubian ibex * Onager * Ostrich * Pachyuromys * Pallid bat * Phyllomedusa * Pocketed free-tailed bat * Pygmy gerbil * Red kangaroo * Rhim gazelle * Ring- tailed cat * Round-tailed ground squirrel * Rueppell's fox * Saharan shrew * Saharan striped polecat * Saiga antelope * Sand cat * Sidewinder rattlesnake * Scimitar oryx * Silver-haired bat * Sonoran collared lizard * Sonoran Desert tortoise * Sonoran pronghorn * Southwestern myotis * Speckled rattlesnake * Spotted bat * Spotted hyena * Striped hyena * Texas banded gecko * Texas horned lizard * Thorny dragon * Townsend's big-eared bat * Water-holding frog * Western black widow * Western diamondback rattlesnake * Western mastiff bat * Western Saharan spiny mouse * Whitaker's shrew * Yuma myotis * Zebra-tailed lizard See also * Arid Forest Research Institute (AFRI) * Chionophile * Deserts and xeric shrublands * Xerophile * Xerophyte  References = Citations  Sources = * External links *Desert Wildlife Photo Gallery from National Geographic *Photo Gallery from Flickr Animal articles needing attention * Xerophiles Animals by adaptation ","title":"Xerocole"},{"id":"18588844","text":"Baghdad clubs * Al-Adala * Al-Bareed * Al-Jaish * Al-Kahraba * Al-Naft * Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya * Al-Ramadi FC * Al-Shorta * Al-Shuala * Al-Sinaa * Al- Talaba * Al-Zawraa North clubs * Arbil FC * Duhok FC * Kirkuk FC * Mosul FC * Pers FC * Samaraa FC * Sirwan FC * Sulaymaniyah FC * Zaxo FC * Sulaymani Peshmarga Sport Club South clubs * Al-Bahri SC * Al-Forat FC * Al-Ittihad * Al-Minaa * Al-Qurna SC * Al-Samawa FC * Al-Shatra FC * Az-Zubayr SC * Ghaz Al-Janoob * Kahrabaa Al-Hartha SC * Karbalaa FC * Kufa FC * Masafi Al-Janoob SC * Maysan FC * Naft Al-Janoob * Najaf FC * Naft Al-Wasat External links * Iraqi Football Website Iraq Football clubs ","title":"List of football clubs in Iraq"},{"id":"18588848","text":"√âtienne Pierre Ventenat (1 March 1757 ‚Äì 13 August 1808) was a French botanist born in Limoges. He was the brother of naturalist Louis Ventenat (1765‚Äì1794). alt=illustration from Jardin de La Malmaison While employed as director of the ecclesiastic library Sainte-Genevi√®ve in Paris, Ventenat took a trip to England. Here he investigated the country's botanical gardens, inspiring him to pursue a vocation in sciences. Following his time at library he became an active botanist, studying under and collaborating with botanist Charles Louis L'H√©ritier de Brutelle (1746‚Äì1800). In 1795 he was elected a member of the Institut national des sciences et des arts, later known as the Acad√©mie des sciences. In 1794 he wrote a treatise on the principles of botany titled Principes de botanique, expliqu√©s au Lyc√©e r√©publicain par Ventenat. After publication he became so disappointed with its mediocrity that he reportedly made efforts to procure all copies of the book and have them destroyed. In 1798 he published a French translation of Antoine-Laurent de Jussieu's Genera plantarum as Tableau du r√®gne v√©g√©tal selon la m√©thode de Jussieu. In his translation of the work, Ventenat added information involving the properties and uses of plants. In 1799 he published Description des plantes nouvelles et peu connues, cultiv√©es dans le jardin de J.-M. Cels, a work that described flora in the botanical garden of Jacques Philippe Martin Cels (1740‚Äì1806), and in 1803 he published Le Jardin de la Malmaison, being written at the request of Jos√©phine de Beauharnais (1763‚Äì1814), who wished to immortalize the rare species of plants found in the gardens and greenhouses of Ch√¢teau de Malmaison. The illustrations in the two aforementioned works were performed by famed botanical artist Pierre-Joseph Redout√© (1759‚Äì1840). Ventenat is also credited with continuing the work on Jean Baptiste Fran√ßois Pierre Bulliard's Histoire des champignons de la France, a landmark work on mushrooms native to France.

Biography Macintosh was born in Breadalbane, Ontario, on 18 February 1877 and received his undergraduate degree from McMaster University when it was in Toronto. In 1907 was ordained a Baptist minister and taught at Brandon College in Manitoba. In 1909 Macintosh received his Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of Chicago and joined Yale Divinity School, becoming an assistant professor of systematic theology.United States v. Macintosh, . During the First World War he volunteered for the Canadian Army and served at the front as a military chaplain. He further oversaw an American YMCA hut in France until the armistice. In 1916 he was named the Dwight Professor of Theology and later served as the chairman of the Yale Religion Department from 1920 to 1938. In 1921, he married Emily Pouell, who died in childbirth the following year. He subsequently married Hope Griswold Conklin in 1925, with whom he did not have children. Macintosh is also notable for a 1931 Supreme Court of the United States case. In 1925 Macintosh petitioned to become a naturalized US citizen. At a hearing before the US District Court for the District of Connecticut Macintosh explained that the moral principles of Christianity would allow him to take the Oath of Allegiance with the understanding that he was only swearing to take up arms in what he believed was a just war. The district court refused to grant Macintosh citizenship. This rejection was then reversed by Judge Thomas Walter Swan, a former Yale Law School Dean, on the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.42 F.2d 845 (2d Cir. 1930). The government appealed, and before the Supreme Court the US Solicitor General Thomas D. Thacher, a Bonesman, appeared, while Macintosh was represented by Charles Edward Clark, a future Yale Law School Dean. The sharply divided court rejected Macintosh's petition for citizenship. Writing for the court, Justice George Sutherland, joined by the other Four Horsemen, found that \\"We are a Christian people\\" but that \\"unqualified allegiance to the Nation and submission and obedience to the laws of the land, as well those made for war as those made for peace, are not inconsistent with the will of God.\\" Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes dissented, joined by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., Justice Louis Brandeis, and then Justice Harlan F. Stone. The dissenters traced Congress's long \\"happy tradition\\" of respecting conscientious objectors and wrote \\"The essence of religion is belief in a relation to God involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation.\\" A decade and a half later the Supreme Court would overturn itself, ruling 5‚Äì3 against the \\"arms-bearing pledge\\" in Girouard v. United States (1946). Macintosh alongside Henry Nelson Wieman, George Burman Foster, and Shailer Mathews is considered a shaper of \\"modernistic liberalism\\". The First World War chaplain's chalice of former Yale University Dwight Professor of Theology Douglas Clyde Macintosh was given to the Yale Law School and accepted by Dean Harold Koh in September 2008 to honour the famous 1931 Supreme Court case, Macintosh v. United States, in which John W. Davis argued Macintosh's right to \\"selective conscientious objection\\" in Macintosh's application as a Canadian for US citizenship. Macintosh's three-quarter-length portrait hangs in the common room of Yale Divinity School. It depicts him with his right hand toward a Bible opened to the commandment \\"Thou shalt have no other gods before me\\" and his left hand extended toward a bound volume of United States v. Macintosh, 1931. The portrait was painted in 1979 by New Haven artist Clarence Brodeur, past President of the Board of Trustees of the Fontainebleau Association, and editor the Fontainebleau School Alumni Bulletin.

In the Free Handicap, an assessment of the year's best two-year-olds, Royal Palace was ranked second, three pounds below Bold Lad. =1967: three-year-old season= Royal Palace made his three-year-old debut in the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket, for which he started 100/30 joint- favourite with Bold Lad in a field of eighteen runners. He was not impressive in the paddock before the race, as he appeared to be agitated and was sweating freely. Ridden by the Australian Racing Hall of Fame jockey George Moore, he challenged for the lead in the final quarter mile and won by a short head from the French-trained colt Taj Dewan. The race was the first British Classic to use starting stalls. The victory was reportedly well-received owing to the popularity of Jim Joel, who was winning his first classic since Royal Palace's great-grandam Picture Play won the 1000 Guineas in 1944. At Epsom Downs Racecourse on 7 June, Royal Palace started 7/4 favourite for the Derby. An unusual feature of the build-up to the race was the huge public gamble on the outsider El Mighty, who was backed from odds of 200/1 to 25/1 after a Peterborough shopkeeper claimed to have seen the horse winning in a dream. El Mighty led the field into the straight, but Royal Palace was always well placed and took the lead two furlongs from the finish. He won by two and a half lengths, defeating Charles Engelhard, Jr.'s, Ribocco with Dart Board two lengths further back in third. Having won the first two legs of the Triple Crown, Royal Palace missed the important summer championship races to be prepared for the St Leger at Doncaster Racecourse. In August he sustained an injury which forced him to miss his trial race in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York. He fell behind in his preparation and worked badly a week before the St Leger, leading his connections to withdraw him from the race. He returned for the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket in October, but failed to reproduce his best form, finishing third behind Reform and Taj Dewan. =1968: four-year-old season= In 1968 the teenager Sandy Barclay replaced Moore and Royal Palace was undefeated in five races. He began by winning the Coronation Stakes at Sandown in May. He then won the Coronation Cup at Epsom and the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot. In July, returned to Sandown for an exceptionally strong renewal of the Eclipse Stakes, in which his opponents included Taj Dewan and the 1968 Derby winner Sir Ivor, who started the 4/5 favourite. The race has been compared to the 1903 Eclipse, in which the Derby winners Ard Patrick and Rock Sand were opposed by the outstanding racemare Sceptre. Taj Dewan took the lead in the straight, and although Royal Palace produced a strong finish he appeared to have narrowly failed to catch the leader. The photo-finish, however, revealed that he had prevailed by a short-head from Taj Dewan, with Sir Ivor in three-quarters of a length behind in third. The race was rated forty-eighth in the Racing Post's 2005 listing of the \\"100 Greatest Races\\". On his final start, Royal Palace contested the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot. His main rival was expected to be Ribero, who had defeated Sir Ivor in the Irish Derby. In the straight Royal Palace sustained an injury to the suspensory ligament in his left foreleg, but stayed on to win by half a length from Felicio, with the future Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Topyo in third and Ribero fourth. The injury ended his racing career and he was retired to stud. Assessment and honours Despite his successes, Royal Palace was never voted British Horse of the Year, being beaten by Busted in 1967 and Sir Ivor in 1968. He was given a relatively modest Timeform rating of 131. Stud career As a stallion, Royal Palace was owned jointly by Jim Joel, Hon. Lady Macdonald-Buchanan, and Lord Howard de Walden. Royal Palace sired some good winners, but his overall record was disappointing. His best flat runner was Dunfermline, winner of the 1977 Epsom Oaks and St. Leger Stakes for her owner, Queen Elizabeth II. Royal Palace later sired the triple Champion Hurdler, See You Then. In 1991, at The National Stud near Newmarket, Suffolk in England, the twenty-seven-year-old Royal Palace was euthanized as a result of infirmities from old age. He is buried in The National Stud's horse cemetery.

Early life and family Henry was born at Juniper Green, Midlothian, Scotland. His father, Robert Henry, was a sawmiller and on leaving school, David Henry worked as a clerk in the Mossy Paper Mill at Colinton while attending night classes in Edinburgh, possibly at Heriot-Watt College. Emigration and early years in New Zealand Indifferent health prompted him to emigrate to New Zealand in 1907. He worked for the Government Printer in Wellington for a brief time before moving to Christchurch, where he founded an engineering business. When the business failed he shifted to Auckland to start afresh. Henry married Mary Castleton Osborne on 28 April 1915 and began working for another engineering and patents company owned by S. Oldfield and D. B. Hutton. By August of the same year, he had bought into the firm, and it was renamed Oldfield & Henry. Within four years he owned the organisation outright and it became known as D. Henry & Co. Henry expanded the business into a profitable small-scale plumbing manufacturer and supplier. Timber industry Henry's New Zealand cousins (see Henry family) had been involved in the fledgling timbermilling industry since their arrival in New Zealand in the 1870s, and in 1936 he was to play a pivotal role in the consolidation of the New Zealand timber industry through his involvement in the merger of his extended family's milling business with the afforestation company, New Zealand Perpetual Forests (a large bond selling company that had established of timber plantations, but had gone bankrupt). Henry struck a hard bargain in purchasing the New Zealand Perpetual Forests assets and was made the chairman and managing director of the new company for his efforts. This new company was New Zealand Forest Products, which remained New Zealand's largest industrial concern and largest company until the privatisation of Telecom New Zealand in the 1990s. In assuming the role of New Zealand's pre-eminent industrialist, Henry was concerned with developing the future utilisation of the company's forests. Sawmill technology for handling Pinus radiata, and the commercial manufacture of pulp and paper from this species, was reasonably undeveloped worldwide. He travelled extensively throughout the United States and Europe to find the newest processing technology and fought a protracted battle with the New Zealand government to overcome bureaucracy. He was successful in convincing the government of the benefits of the company's industrialisation and in 1941 opened the first large-scale sawmill and insulating board plant at Penrose, Auckland. Henry also clashed with the government over its plans to nationalise the New Zealand timber industry to create an integrated state sector forest and timber manufacturing company. This battle continued until the election of a National Government in 1949. In 1943, Henry chose a mill site near Tokoroa, near the company's forest plantations. He built Kinleith Mill (after a paper mill in Scotland), which was to become famous as New Zealand's largest industrial processing complex. Kinleith manufactured the first commercially produced kraft pulp in New Zealand in 1953. It was the culmination of 17 years of effort by Henry. In the 1954 Queen's Birthday Honours, Henry was appointed a Knight Bachelor in recognition of his role as chairman and managing director of New Zealand Forest Products. Other activities Henry was very involved in the community. He used his business success in Auckland to become increasingly involved with a wide range of organisations, including the Rotary Club of Auckland, the Boy Scouts' Association, the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA), the Auckland Manufacturers' Association (eventually becoming national president), and he sat as an elected councillor on the Auckland City Council (from 1931 until 1933). He was also well known for his philanthropy, endowing a forestry scholarship bearing his name in 1956 to provide overseas training for employees of New Zealand Forest Products. He also established a substantial trust for the Auckland Presbyterian Orphanages and Social Service Association (now known as Presbyterian Support). Later life Henry's wife died in 1954, but the next year, now aged 67, he married Dorothy May Osborne, the younger sister of his first wife. However, he showed no interest in retiring as chairman of New Zealand Forest Products, and continued to battle the government over industry licensing, while beginning to display increasingly erratic behaviour. This is evidenced by his conduct in 1958 when he encouraged the British pulp and paper giant Bowater Paper Corporation to make an unsuccessful takeover for New Zealand Forest Products, and he began to make uncharacteristically rash statements to the national press. Despite being ill with a heart condition, Henry continued to be active at the company, holding many meetings at his Remuera residence, during which he was known to lash out verbally. In his history of New Zealand Forest Products, titled A Hundred Million Trees, Brian Healy said \\"Sir David Henry lacked warmth and humour in his working relations and tended to be abrupt and demanding with his subordinates. Yet he was a fluent and persuasive speaker whose self-assurance, business acumen and tenacity were vital in enabling New Zealand Forest Products to overcome enormous barriers and to develop into one of the country's largest industrial enterprises.\\"  References  *Healy, B.

Fudd is a fictional cartoon character in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies series, and an adversary of Bugs Bunny. He has one of the more disputed origins in the Warner Bros. cartoon pantheon (second only to Bugs himself).Elmer Fudd at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on June 16, 2016. His aim is to hunt Bugs, but he usually ends up seriously injuring himself and other antagonizing characters. He speaks in an unusual way, replacing his Rs and Ls with Ws, so he often refers to Bugs Bunny as a \\"scwewy\\" or \\"wascawwy (rascally) wabbit\\". Elmer's signature catchphrase is, \\"Shhh. Be vewy vewy quiet, I'm hunting wabbits\\", as well as his trademark laughter. The best known Elmer Fudd cartoons include Chuck Jones' work What's Opera, Doc? (one of the few times Fudd bested Bugs, though he felt bad about it), the Rossini parody Rabbit of Seville, and the \\"Hunting Trilogy\\" of \\"Rabbit Season/Duck Season\\" shorts (Rabbit Fire, Rabbit Seasoning, and Duck! Rabbit, Duck!) with Fudd, Bugs Bunny, and Daffy Duck. An earlier character named Egghead set some of Elmer's aspects before the character's more conspicuous features were set. Egghead \\"Egghead\\" as he appeared in 1939's A Day at the Zoo. Tex Avery introduced a new character in his cartoon short Egghead Rides Again, released July 17, 1937.Egghead at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on June 16, 2016. Egghead initially was depicted as having a bulbous nose, funny/eccentric clothing, a voice like Joe Penner (provided either by radio mimic Danny Webb or actor Cliff Nazarro) and an egg-shaped head. Many cartoon historians believe that Egghead evolved into Elmer over a period of a couple of years. However, animation historian Michael Barrier asserts, \\"The Egghead-Elmer story is actually a little messy, my sense being that most of the people involved, whether they were making the films or publicizing them, not only had trouble telling the characters apart but had no idea why they should bother trying.\\" Egghead made his second appearance in 1937's Little Red Walking Hood and then in 1938 teamed with Warner Bros.' newest cartoon star Daffy Duck in Daffy Duck & Egghead. Egghead continued to make appearances in the Warner cartoons in 1938, such as in The Isle of Pingo Pongo and A-Lad-In Bagdad. In A Feud There Was (1938), Egghead made his entrance riding a motor scooter with the words \\"Elmer Fudd, Peacemaker\\" displayed on the side, the first onscreen use of that name. Egghead shifts from having a Moe Howard haircut to being bald, and wears a brown derby, a baggy suit, and a high-collared shirt. Egghead returned decades later in the compilation film Daffy Duck's Quackbusters. More recently, he also made a cameo appearance at the end of Looney Tunes: Back in Action and was also given in his own story, which starred him alongside Pete Puma, in the Looney Tunes comic book. One animation history suggests that the Egghead character was based on Ripley's Believe It or Not! cartoonist and entertainer Robert Ripley, while the name Elmer Fudd might have been a reference to the then-popular hunter Elmer Keith. Egghead has the distinction of being the first recurring character created for Leon Schlesinger's Merrie Melodies series (to be followed by such characters as Sniffles, Inki, and even Bugs Bunny), which had previously contained only one-shot characters, although during the Harman- Ising era, Foxy, Goopy Geer, and Piggy each appeared in a few Merrie Melodies. One of Egghead's final appearances is A Day at the Zoo, which ends with Egghead being swallowed by a lion he had been taunting. Whether intentional or coincidental, this was the end for the Egghead character. In the 1939 cartoon Dangerous Dan McFoo, a new voice actor, Arthur Q. Bryan, was hired to provide the voice of the hero dog character. It was in this cartoon that the popular \\"milk-sop\\" voice of Elmer Fudd was created. Elmer Fudd has since been the chief antagonistic force in the majority of the Bugs Bunny cartoons, initiating one of the most famous rivalries in the history of American cinema. Barrier notes, \\"Elmer Fudd was not a modified version of his fellow Warner Bros. character Egghead\\" and that \\"the two characters were always distinct. That was evidenced ... by Elmer's being identified in a Warner publicity sheet for Cinderella Meets Fella (filed with the Library of Congress as a copyright description) as 'Egghead's brother.'\\" Elmer emerges a rabbit in Elmer's Candid Camera. In 1940, Egghead‚ÄìElmer's appearance was refined, giving him a chin and a less bulbous nose (although still wearing Egghead's clothing) and Arthur Q. Bryan's \\"Dan McFoo\\" voice in what most people consider Elmer Fudd's first true appearance: a Chuck Jones short entitled Elmer's Candid Camera. The rabbit drives Elmer insane. Later that year, he appeared in Friz Freleng's Confederate Honey (where he's called Ned Cutler) and The Hardship of Miles Standish where his voice and Egghead-like appearance were still the same. Jones would use this Elmer one more time, in 1941's Elmer's Pet Rabbit; its other title character is labeled as Bugs Bunny, but is also identical to his counterpart in Camera. In the interim, the two starred in A Wild Hare. Bugs appears with a carrot, New York accent, and \\"What's Up, Doc?\\" catchphrase all in place for the first time, although the voice and physique are as yet somewhat off. Elmer has a better voice, a trimmer figure (designed by Robert Givens, which would be reused soon later in Jones' Good Night Elmer, this time without a red nose) and his familiar hunting clothes. He is much more recognizable as the Elmer Fudd of later cartoons than Bugs is here. In his earliest appearances, Elmer actually \\"wikes wabbits\\", either attempting to take photos of Bugs, or adopting Bugs as his pet. The rascally rabbit has the poor Fudd so perplexed that there is little wonder as to why Elmer would become a hunter and in some cases actually proclaim, \\"I hate wittle gway wabbits!\\" after pumping buckshot down a rabbit hole. Elmer in Rabbit Fire (1951). Elmer's role in these two films, that of would-be hunter, dupe and foil for Bugs, would remain his main role forever after, and although Bugs Bunny was called upon to outwit many more worthy opponents, Elmer somehow remained Bugs' classic nemesis, despite (or because of) his legendary gullibility, small size, short temper, and shorter attention span. In Rabbit Fire, he declares himself vegetarian, hunting for sport only.Warner Bros. Rabbit Fire. Elmer: I'm a vegetawian. I onwwy hunt for the sport. Elmer was usually cast as a hapless big-game hunter, armed with a double-barreled shotgun (albeit one which could be fired much more than twice without being reloaded) and creeping through the woods \\"hunting wabbits\\". In a few cartoons, though, he assumed a completely different persona‚Äîa wealthy industrialist type, occupying a luxurious penthouse, or, in one episode involving a role reversal, a sanitarium‚Äîwhich Bugs would of course somehow find his way into. In Dog Gone People, he had an ordinary office job working for demanding boss \\"Mister Cwabtwee\\". In another cartoon (Mutt in a Rut) he appeared to work in an office and had a dog he called \\"Wover Boy\\", whom he took hunting, though Bugs did not appear. (Elmer also has a hunting dog in To Duck or Not to Duck; in that film, the dog is named Laramore.) Several episodes featured Elmer differently. One (What's Up, Doc?, 1950) has Bugs Bunny relating his life story to a biographer, and recalling a time which was a downturn for the movie business. Elmer Fudd is a well-known entertainer who, looking for a new partner for his act, sees Bugs Bunny (after passing caricatures of many other famous 1940s actors (Al Jolson, Jack Benny, Eddie Cantor, Bing Crosby) who, like Bugs, are also out of work). Elmer and Bugs do a one-joke act cross- country, with Bugs dressed like a pinhead, and when he does not know the answer to a joke, Elmer gives it and hits him with a pie in the face. Bugs begins to tire of this gag and pulls a surprise on Fudd, answering the joke correctly and bopping Elmer with a mallet, which prompts the man to point his rifle at Bugs. The bunny asks nervously: \\"Eh, what's up doc?\\", which results in a huge round of applause from the audience. Bugs tells Elmer they may be on to something, and Elmer, with the vaudevillian's instinct of sticking with a gag that catches on, nods that they should re-use it. According to this account, the common Elmer-as-hunter episodes are entirely staged. One episode where Bugs \\"lost\\" in the hunting was Hare Brush (1956). Here, Elmer has been committed to an insane asylum because he believes he is a rabbit (though it is also revealed that he is a millionaire and owns a mansion and a yacht). Bugs Bunny enters Fudd's room and Elmer bribes him with carrots, then leaves the way the real rabbit entered. Bugs acts surprisingly (for him) na√Øve, assuming Elmer just wanted to go outside for a while. Elmer's psychiatrist arrives, and thinking Fudd's delusion has affected his appearance, drugs Bugs and conditions him into believing that he is Elmer Fudd 'after which Bugs starts wearing hunting clothes and acting like Elmer, hunting the rabbit-costumed Fudd, who is in turn acting like Bugs. Their hunt is cut short when Bugs is arrested by a government agent as Elmer Fudd is wanted for tax evasion. After Bugs is hauled away trying to explain that the rabbit is Elmer Fudd, Fudd breaks the fourth wall and tells the audience \\"I may be a scwewy wabbit, but I'm not going to Alcatwaz\\" as he hops away as if he had planned the whole thing. Elmer Fudd has occasionally appeared in other costumes, notably as Cupid, opposite Daffy Duck in The Stupid Cupid (1944). The Bugs‚ÄìElmer partnership was so familiar to audiences that in a late 1950s cartoon, Bugs' Bonnets, a character study is made of what happens to the relationship between the two when they each accidentally don a different selection of hats (Native American wig, pilgrim hat, military helmets, bridal veil and top hat, to name a few). The result is comic mayhem; a steady game of one-upmanship that ultimately leads to matrimony. Fat Elmer Elmer Fudd (right) in Any Bonds Today? (1942) For a short time in the 1941‚Äì1942 season, Elmer's appearance was modified again, for five cartoons: Wabbit Twouble, The Wacky Wabbit, The Wabbit Who Came to Supper, Any Bonds Today? and Fresh Hare. He became a heavy- set, beer-bellied character, patterned after Arthur Q. Bryan's real-life appearance, and still chasing Bugs (or vice versa). However, audiences did not accept a fat Fudd, so ultimately the slimmer version returned for good. This time period also saw a temporary change in Elmer's relationship with Bugs Bunny. Instead of being the hunter, Elmer was the victim of unprovoked pestering by Bugs. In Wabbit Twouble, Bugs plays a number of gags on Elmer, advising the audience, \\"I do dis kind o' stuff to him all t'wough da picture!\\" (A line somewhat ironically would later be said by Cecil Turtle as he and his friends cheat Bugs out of winning a race). Another short, The Wacky Wabbit, finds Elmer focused on prospecting for gold which would be used to fund the World War II effort. Elmer sings a variation of the old prospector's tune \\"Oh! Susanna\\" made just for this cartoon (complete with the phrase \\"V for Victory\\"), with Bugs joining in just before starting to hassle Elmer. He made a later appearance in an episode of The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries as a Russian version with a simple name \\"Boris\\" who owns another comedy club in Russia. Elmer-speak He nearly always vocalised consonants [r] and [l], pronouncing them as [w] instead (a trait that also characterized Tweety Bird) when he would talk in his slightly raspy voice. This trait was prevalent in the Elmer's Candid Camera and Elmer's Pet Rabbit cartoons, where the writers would give him exaggerated lines such as, \\"My, that weawwy was a dewicious weg of wamb.\\" to further exaggerate his qualities as a harmless nebbish. That characteristic seemed to fit his somewhat timid and childlike persona. And it worked. The writers often gave him lines filled with those letters, such as doing Shakespeare's Romeo as \\"What wight thwough yonduh window bweaks!\\" or Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries as \\"Kiww the wabbit, kiww the wabbit, kiww the wabbit...!\\" or \\"The Beautifuw Bwue Danube, by Johann Stwauss\\", Stage Door Cartoon's line \\"Oh, you dubbuh-cwossing wabbit! You tweachewous miscweant!\\" or the name of actress \\"Owivia deHaviwwand\\". Part of the joke is that Elmer is presumably incapable of pronouncing his own first name correctly. Occasionally Elmer would properly pronounce an \\"r\\" or \\"l\\" sound, depending on whether or not it was vital for the audience to understand what the word was. (For example, in 1944's The Old Grey Hare, he clearly pronounces the \\"r\\" in the word \\"picture\\".) Usually, Elmer mispronounces the \\"r\\" and \\"l\\" by substituting the sound of \\"w\\". Later appearances Elmer Fudd made appearances in several television specials in the 1970s and 1980s, and some cameo roles in two of the Looney Tunes feature-film compilations. Elmer made a brief headshot cameo appearance in the final scene of Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) with other famous characters. Elmer would also appear frequently on the animated series Tiny Toon Adventures as a teacher at Acme Looniversity, where he was the idol and favorite teacher of Elmyra Duff, the slightly deranged animal lover who resembles Elmer in basic head design, name and lack of intellect. On the other hand, a younger version of him makes a single appearance in the episode Plucky's Dastardly Deed, and is named \\"Egghead Jr\\", the \\"smartest kid in class\\". Elmer also made cameos on Animaniacs, one in Turkey Jerky, another in the Pinky and the Brain short, Don't Tread on Us. Elmer also had a guest starring appearance on Histeria! in the episode \\"The Teddy Roosevelt Show\\", in a sketch where he portrayed Gutzon Borglum. This sketch depicts Elmer/Gutzon's construction of Mount Rushmore, accompanied by Borglum's son Lincoln, portrayed by Loud Kiddington. Elmer made another appearance on Histeria!, this time in his traditional role, during a sketch where the bald eagle trades places with the turkey during Thanksgiving weekend, featured in the episode \\"Americana\\". Fudd also appeared on The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries in the first-season episode A Ticket to Crime as detective Sam Fudd; at the end he took off his clothes and turned into Elmer. Elmer appears as part of the TuneSquad team in Space Jam. In one part of the game he and Yosemite Sam shoot down the teeth of one of the Monstars dressed in black suits while Misirlou is heard in the background. Elmer took on a more villainous role in Looney Tunes: Back in Action. He first appears as Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck's co-star in a new movie, where he shoots Daffy repeatedly, and is later seen shooting Bugs per the film's script after Daffy's firing. He later appears in the Louvre museum, where he reveals himself to be a secret agent for the Acme Corporation. Elmer chases Bugs and Daffy through the paintings in the Louvre museum, taking on the different art styles as they do so. At the end, Elmer forgets to change back to his normal style after jumping out of the pointillist painting Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat, allowing Bugs to easily disintegrate Elmer by blowing a fan at him. A four-year-old version of Elmer was featured in the Baby Looney Tunes episode \\"A Bully for Bugs\\", where he kept taking all of Bugs' candy, and also bullied the rest of his friends. He was also shown with short blond hair. He appeared in most of the songs. An even more villainous Elmer appeared in two episodes of Duck Dodgers as The Mother Fudd, an alien who would spread a disease that caused all affected by it to stand around laughing like Elmer (a parody of the Flood in Halo and the Borg in Star Trek). In Loonatics Unleashed, his descendant, Electro J. Fudd, tried to prove himself the universe's greatest hunter by capturing Ace Bunny, but settled for Danger Duck instead. Elmer himself also makes an appearance in the form of a photo which shows he presumably died at the hands of a giant squirrel. In December 2009, Elmer made an appearance in a Geico commercial where the director tells him to say rabbits instead of \\"wabbits\\". He was again voiced by Billy West. Elmer Fudd appears in The Looney Tunes Show, voiced by Billy West. Portrayed as a wealthy businessman coming home after a hard day's work in the \\"Merrie Melodies\\" part of the episode \\"Best Friends,\\" he sings about his love of \\"gwiwwed cheese\\" sandwiches. He later had a brief cameo appearance in \\"Fish and Visitors\\" as a weather forecaster briefly exclaiming about the rainy weather and doing his famous chuckle at the end. In \\"Working Duck,\\" Elmer Fudd appeared as a newsman where he reports that Daffy Duck was fired from his position as a security guard after falling asleep during a nighttime bank robbery where $10,000,000.00 were stolen. Later on, Elmer Fudd reports that EnormoCorp went out of business due to the worst business decision in the history of business decisions caused by its CEO Daffy Duck (who succeeded the previous CEO Foghorn Leghorn who retired) where he went with the \\"Proceed as Planned\\" choice instead of the \\"Delay the Merger\\" choice when he mistook Pete Puma as the new muffin man. As a result of this, Elmer mentioned that 10,000 of its workers are now out of a job and states that experts fear that the world economy could collapse. Elmer also states that disgraced CEO Daffy Duck could not be reached for a comment. In \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" Elmer Fudd reports on Foghorn Leghorn's plans to end the heat wave on Christmas. Elmer Fudd later joins the other characters in the Christmas song called \\"Christmas Rules\\" at the end of the episode. In \\"Dear John,\\" Elmer Fudd reports on Daffy Duck winning a spot on the city council. Elmer Fudd later reports on Daffy Duck's apparent death where he supposedly lost control of his parade float and drove into the St. Bastian River. In \\"The Black Widow,\\" Elmer Fudd reports on the theft of the Hillhurst Diamond from the museum caused by someone called \\"The Black Widow.\\" On June 8, 2011, Elmer starred in the 3-D short \\"Daffy's Rhapsody\\" with Daffy Duck. That short was going to precede the film Happy Feet Two, but was instead shown with Journey 2: The Mysterious Island. Elmer Fudd appears in Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run, voiced again by Billy West. He appears as a spy working for the Mexican general Foghorn Leghorn. In the 2017 DC Comics/Looney Tunes crossover books, an alternate version of Elmer Fudd was created for a story in which the character was designed more for the DC Universe and was pitted against Batman in the Batman/Elmer Fudd Special. In the story, Elmer is a bounty hunter that originated from the country side before he moved to Gotham to make ends meet. He considered putting the shotgun away for good when he fell in love with Silver St. Cloud, but she was killed by hitman Bugs \\"The Bunny\\". He goes to a bar called Porky's (which has attendants that are humanoid versions of other famous Looney Tunes stars) to kill Bugs. Bugs confesses to killing Silver, but avoids death by telling Elmer that Bruce Wayne hired him to do it. Elmer believes Bugs as Bruce was Silver's former lover, and shoots Bruce at a party for vengeance. Batman confronts Elmer in his apartment and defeats the gunman in a fight, where Elmer tells Batman about Silver's death and Bugs. Elmer and Batman return to Porky's and take out most of the crowd before confronting Bugs. The three are shocked to find Silver in the bar herself, where she revealed that she left Bruce and Elmer because of their dangerous lifestyles and had Bugs fake her death. The story ends with all three of the men requesting a glass of carrot juice from Porky. In the issue's backup story, Bugs, Elmer, and Batman re-enact the famous \\"Rabbit Season, Duck Season\\" sketch with Batman replacing Daffy as Bugs tells Elmer it's \\"Bat Season\\". After getting shot by Elmer too many times, Batman takes Bugs' advice and makes it Robin season, causing Elmer to pursue the Dark Knight's sidekicks instead.Batman/Elmer Fudd Special #1 Elmer Fudd appears in New Looney Tunes, voiced by Jeff Bergman. As of May 2020, Elmer Fudd is now depicted without his trademark double-barreled shotgun in the new Looney Tunes Cartoons on the streaming service, HBO Max. The series executive producer and showrunner, Peter Browngardt, said the character can continue to use cartoon violence, such as dynamite and Acme related paraphernalia. The absence of the shotgun has garnered both acclaim and controversy. Portrayal Fudd was originally voiced by radio actor Arthur Q. Bryan, but seven times in Bryan's lifetime the voice was provided by the versatile Mel Blanc: in Good Night Elmer (1940), Blanc did Elmer's crying; in The Wacky Wabbit (1942), Blanc did Fudd's screams of fear; in The Big Snooze (1946), Blanc spoke as Fudd crying, \\"Oh, agony, agony!\\"; in The Scarlet Pumpernickel (1950), only a single line was needed, and bringing in Bryan was not cost effective; in Quack Shot (1954), Blanc did Elmer's laugh after he is shot in the face by his toy battleship; in Wideo Wabbit, Blanc did Elmer's cry of pain; and in What's Opera, Doc?, Elmer's furious scream \\"SMOG!\\" was dubbed by Blanc, although Bryan had voiced the rest of the part. In The Stupid Cupid (1944), since Elmer has no dialogue in the cartoon, Frank Graham provided his laugh. Later, during the musician's union strike of 1958, Dave Barry did the voice for Elmer's co-starring appearance in Pre-Hysterical Hare, as Bryan was ill during production of the cartoon. In 1959, Bryan died aged 60, and Hal Smith was selected to replace him as Elmer, but after just two cartoons were recorded by the new actor, and another was made in which Fudd has no lines and therefore no voice, the character was soon retired. Although in more recent years other voice actors have alternated as Elmer's voice, Bryan's characterization remains the definitive one. He was never credited onscreen, because Blanc had a clause in his contract that required him to receive a screen credit and, perhaps inadvertently, denied the same to other voice performers. Blanc supplied Elmer's voice for new footage in The Bugs Bunny Show, while Smith voiced the character in the commercials. He would take on the role regularly in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, supplying Elmer's voice for new footage in The Porky Pig Show, compilation feature films and similar TV specials, as well as some all-new specials. He admitted in his autobiography that he found the voice difficult to get \\"right\\", never quite making it his own, which is why his Elmer voice sounded deep and gravelly in the 1960s and 1970s; however, it began sounding close to Bryan's Elmer voice, beginning with Bugs Bunny's Valentine (1979). In Speechless (1989), the famous lithograph issued following Blanc's death, Elmer is not shown among the characters bowing their heads in tribute to Blanc. =Other voice actors= Besides Arthur Q.

Shut down in 2011, until 2007 it was the most powerful particle accelerator in the world, accelerating protons to an energy of over 1 TeV (tera electron volts). Beams of circulating protons in the two circular vacuum chambers in the two rings visible collided at their intersection point. linear accelerator, widely used in both physics research and cancer treatment. A particle accelerator is a machine that uses electromagnetic fields to propel charged particles to very high speeds and energies, and to contain them in well-defined beams. Large accelerators are used for basic research in particle physics. The largest accelerator currently operating is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) near Geneva, Switzerland, operated by the CERN. It is a collider accelerator, which can accelerate two beams of protons to an energy of 6.5 TeV and cause them to collide head-on, creating center-of-mass energies of 13 TeV. Other powerful accelerators are SuperKEKB at KEK in Japan, RHIC at Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York and, formerly, the Tevatron at Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois. Accelerators are also used as synchrotron light sources for the study of condensed matter physics. Smaller particle accelerators are used in a wide variety of applications, including particle therapy for oncological purposes, radioisotope production for medical diagnostics, ion implanters for manufacture of semiconductors, and accelerator mass spectrometers for measurements of rare isotopes such as radiocarbon. There are currently more than 30,000 accelerators in operation around the world. There are two basic classes of accelerators: electrostatic and electrodynamic (or electromagnetic) accelerators. Electrostatic accelerators use static electric fields to accelerate particles. The most common types are the Cockcroft‚ÄìWalton generator and the Van de Graaff generator. A small-scale example of this class is the cathode ray tube in an ordinary old television set. The achievable kinetic energy for particles in these devices is determined by the accelerating voltage, which is limited by electrical breakdown. Electrodynamic or electromagnetic accelerators, on the other hand, use changing electromagnetic fields (either magnetic induction or oscillating radio frequency fields) to accelerate particles. Since in these types the particles can pass through the same accelerating field multiple times, the output energy is not limited by the strength of the accelerating field. This class, which was first developed in the 1920s, is the basis for most modern large-scale accelerators. Rolf Wider√∏e, Gustav Ising, Le√≥ Szil√°rd, Max Steenbeck, and Ernest Lawrence are considered pioneers of this field, conceiving and building the first operational linear particle accelerator,Pedro Waloschek (ed.): The Infancy of Particle Accelerators: Life and Work of Rolf Wider√∂e, Vieweg, 1994 the betatron, and the cyclotron. Because the target of the particle beams of early accelerators was usually the atoms of a piece of matter, with the goal being to create collisions with their nuclei in order to investigate nuclear structure, accelerators were commonly referred to as atom smashers in the 20th century. The term persists despite the fact that many modern accelerators create collisions between two subatomic particles, rather than a particle and an atomic nucleus. Uses Beamlines leading from the Van de Graaff accelerator to various experiments, in the basement of the Jussieu Campus in Paris. Building covering the 2 mile (3.2 km) beam tube of the Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC) at Menlo Park, California, the second most powerful linac in the world. Beams of high-energy particles are useful for fundamental and applied research in the sciences, and also in many technical and industrial fields unrelated to fundamental research. It has been estimated that there are approximately 30,000 accelerators worldwide. Of these, only about 1% are research machines with energies above 1 GeV, while about 44% are for radiotherapy, 41% for ion implantation, 9% for industrial processing and research, and 4% for biomedical and other low-energy research. = High-energy physics = For the most basic inquiries into the dynamics and structure of matter, space, and time, physicists seek the simplest kinds of interactions at the highest possible energies. These typically entail particle energies of many GeV, and interactions of the simplest kinds of particles: leptons (e.g. electrons and positrons) and quarks for the matter, or photons and gluons for the field quanta. Since isolated quarks are experimentally unavailable due to color confinement, the simplest available experiments involve the interactions of, first, leptons with each other, and second, of leptons with nucleons, which are composed of quarks and gluons. To study the collisions of quarks with each other, scientists resort to collisions of nucleons, which at high energy may be usefully considered as essentially 2-body interactions of the quarks and gluons of which they are composed. Thus elementary particle physicists tend to use machines creating beams of electrons, positrons, protons, and antiprotons, interacting with each other or with the simplest nuclei (e.g., hydrogen or deuterium) at the highest possible energies, generally hundreds of GeV or more. The largest and highest-energy particle accelerator used for elementary particle physics is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, operating since 2009. = Nuclear physics and isotope production = Nuclear physicists and cosmologists may use beams of bare atomic nuclei, stripped of electrons, to investigate the structure, interactions, and properties of the nuclei themselves, and of condensed matter at extremely high temperatures and densities, such as might have occurred in the first moments of the Big Bang. These investigations often involve collisions of heavy nucleiof atoms like iron or goldat energies of several GeV per nucleon. The largest such particle accelerator is the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Particle accelerators can also produce proton beams, which can produce proton-rich medical or research isotopes as opposed to the neutron-rich ones made in fission reactors; however, recent work has shown how to make 99Mo, usually made in reactors, by accelerating isotopes of hydrogen, although this method still requires a reactor to produce tritium. An example of this type of machine is LANSCE at Los Alamos. = Synchrotron radiation = Electrons propagating through a magnetic field emit very bright and coherent photon beams via synchrotron radiation. It has numerous uses in the study of atomic structure, chemistry, condensed matter physics, biology, and technology. A large number of synchrotron light sources exist worldwide. Examples in the U.S. are SSRL at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, APS at Argonne National Laboratory, ALS at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and NSLS at Brookhaven National Laboratory. In Europe, there are MAX IV in Lund, Sweden, BESSY in Berlin, Germany, Diamond in Oxfordshire, UK, ESRF in Grenoble, France, the latter has been used to extract detailed 3-dimensional images of insects trapped in amber. Free-electron lasers (FELs) are a special class of light sources based on synchrotron radiation that provides shorter pulses with higher temporal coherence. A specially designed FEL is the most brilliant source of x-rays in the observable universe. The most prominent examples are the LCLS in the U.S. and European XFEL in Germany. More attention is being drawn towards soft x-ray lasers, which together with pulse shortening opens up new methods for attosecond science. Apart from x-rays, FELs are used to emit terahertz light, e.g. FELIX in Nijmegen, Netherlands, TELBE in Dresden, Germany and NovoFEL in Novosibirsk, Russia. Thus there is a great demand for electron accelerators of moderate (GeV) energy, high intensity and high beam quality to drive light sources. = Low-energy machines and particle therapy = Everyday examples of particle accelerators are cathode ray tubes found in television sets and X-ray generators. These low-energy accelerators use a single pair of electrodes with a DC voltage of a few thousand volts between them. In an X-ray generator, the target itself is one of the electrodes. A low-energy particle accelerator called an ion implanter is used in the manufacture of integrated circuits. At lower energies, beams of accelerated nuclei are also used in medicine as particle therapy, for the treatment of cancer. DC accelerator types capable of accelerating particles to speeds sufficient to cause nuclear reactions are Cockcroft-Walton generators or voltage multipliers, which convert AC to high voltage DC, or Van de Graaff generators that use static electricity carried by belts. = Radiation sterilization of medical devices = Electron beam processing is commonly used for sterilization. Electron beams are an on-off technology that provide a much higher dose rate than gamma or X-rays emitted by radioisotopes like cobalt-60 (60Co) or caesium-137 (137Cs). Due to the higher dose rate, less exposure time is required and polymer degradation is reduced. Because electrons carry a charge, electron beams are less penetrating than both gamma and X-rays. Electrostatic particle accelerators A Cockcroft-Walton generator (Philips, 1937), residing in Science Museum (London). A 1960s single stage 2 MeV linear Van de Graaff accelerator, here opened for maintenance Historically, the first accelerators used simple technology of a single static high voltage to accelerate charged particles. The charged particle was accelerated through an evacuated tube with an electrode at either end, with the static potential across it. Since the particle passed only once through the potential difference, the output energy was limited to the accelerating voltage of the machine. While this method is still extremely popular today, with the electrostatic accelerators greatly out-numbering any other type, they are more suited to lower energy studies owing to the practical voltage limit of about 1 MV for air insulated machines, or 30 MV when the accelerator is operated in a tank of pressurized gas with high dielectric strength, such as sulfur hexafluoride. In a tandem accelerator the potential is used twice to accelerate the particles, by reversing the charge of the particles while they are inside the terminal. This is possible with the acceleration of atomic nuclei by using anions (negatively charged ions), and then passing the beam through a thin foil to strip electrons off the anions inside the high voltage terminal, converting them to cations (positively charged ions), which are accelerated again as they leave the terminal. The two main types of electrostatic accelerator are the Cockcroft- Walton accelerator, which uses a diode-capacitor voltage multiplier to produce high voltage, and the Van de Graaff accelerator, which uses a moving fabric belt to carry charge to the high voltage electrode. Although electrostatic accelerators accelerate particles along a straight line, the term linear accelerator is more often used for accelerators that employ oscillating rather than static electric fields. Electrodynamic (electromagnetic) particle accelerators Due to the high voltage ceiling imposed by electrical discharge, in order to accelerate particles to higher energies, techniques involving dynamic fields rather than static fields are used. Electrodynamic acceleration can arise from either of two mechanisms: non-resonant magnetic induction, or resonant circuits or cavities excited by oscillating RF fields. Electrodynamic accelerators can be linear, with particles accelerating in a straight line, or circular, using magnetic fields to bend particles in a roughly circular orbit. =Magnetic induction accelerators= Magnetic induction accelerators accelerate particles by induction from an increasing magnetic field, as if the particles were the secondary winding in a transformer. The increasing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field which can be configured to accelerate the particles. Induction accelerators can be either linear or circular. Linear induction accelerators Linear induction accelerators utilize ferrite-loaded, non- resonant induction cavities. Each cavity can be thought of as two large washer-shaped disks connected by an outer cylindrical tube. Between the disks is a ferrite toroid. A voltage pulse applied between the two disks causes an increasing magnetic field which inductively couples power into the charged particle beam. The linear induction accelerator was invented by Christofilos in the 1960s. Linear induction accelerators are capable of accelerating very high beam currents (>1000 A) in a single short pulse. They have been used to generate X-rays for flash radiography (e.g. DARHT at LANL), and have been considered as particle injectors for magnetic confinement fusion and as drivers for free electron lasers. Betatrons The Betatron is circular magnetic induction accelerator, invented by Donald Kerst in 1940 for accelerating electrons. The concept originates ultimately from Norwegian- German scientist Rolf Wider√∏e. These machines, like synchrotrons, use a donut- shaped ring magnet (see below) with a cyclically increasing B field, but accelerate the particles by induction from the increasing magnetic field, as if they were the secondary winding in a transformer, due to the changing magnetic flux through the orbit. Achieving constant orbital radius while supplying the proper accelerating electric field requires that the magnetic flux linking the orbit be somewhat independent of the magnetic field on the orbit, bending the particles into a constant radius curve. These machines have in practice been limited by the large radiative losses suffered by the electrons moving at nearly the speed of light in a relatively small radius orbit. =Linear accelerators= Modern superconducting radio frequency, multicell linear accelerator component. In a linear particle accelerator (linac), particles are accelerated in a straight line with a target of interest at one end. They are often used to provide an initial low-energy kick to particles before they are injected into circular accelerators. The longest linac in the world is the Stanford Linear Accelerator, SLAC, which is long. SLAC is an electron-positron collider. Linear high-energy accelerators use a linear array of plates (or drift tubes) to which an alternating high-energy field is applied. As the particles approach a plate they are accelerated towards it by an opposite polarity charge applied to the plate. As they pass through a hole in the plate, the polarity is switched so that the plate now repels them and they are now accelerated by it towards the next plate. Normally a stream of \\"bunches\\" of particles are accelerated, so a carefully controlled AC voltage is applied to each plate to continuously repeat this process for each bunch. As the particles approach the speed of light the switching rate of the electric fields becomes so high that they operate at radio frequencies, and so microwave cavities are used in higher energy machines instead of simple plates. Linear accelerators are also widely used in medicine, for radiotherapy and radiosurgery. Medical grade linacs accelerate electrons using a klystron and a complex bending magnet arrangement which produces a beam of 6-30 MeV energy. The electrons can be used directly or they can be collided with a target to produce a beam of X-rays. The reliability, flexibility and accuracy of the radiation beam produced has largely supplanted the older use of cobalt-60 therapy as a treatment tool. =Circular or cyclic RF accelerators= In the circular accelerator, particles move in a circle until they reach sufficient energy. The particle track is typically bent into a circle using electromagnets. The advantage of circular accelerators over linear accelerators (linacs) is that the ring topology allows continuous acceleration, as the particle can transit indefinitely. Another advantage is that a circular accelerator is smaller than a linear accelerator of comparable power (i.e. a linac would have to be extremely long to have the equivalent power of a circular accelerator). Depending on the energy and the particle being accelerated, circular accelerators suffer a disadvantage in that the particles emit synchrotron radiation. When any charged particle is accelerated, it emits electromagnetic radiation and secondary emissions. As a particle traveling in a circle is always accelerating towards the center of the circle, it continuously radiates towards the tangent of the circle. This radiation is called synchrotron light and depends highly on the mass of the accelerating particle. For this reason, many high energy electron accelerators are linacs. Certain accelerators (synchrotrons) are however built specially for producing synchrotron light (X-rays). Since the special theory of relativity requires that matter always travels slower than the speed of light in a vacuum, in high-energy accelerators, as the energy increases the particle speed approaches the speed of light as a limit, but never attains it. Therefore, particle physicists do not generally think in terms of speed, but rather in terms of a particle's energy or momentum, usually measured in electron volts (eV). An important principle for circular accelerators, and particle beams in general, is that the curvature of the particle trajectory is proportional to the particle charge and to the magnetic field, but inversely proportional to the (typically relativistic) momentum. Cyclotrons Lawrence's 60 inch cyclotron, with magnet poles 60 inches (5 feet, 1.5 meters) in diameter, at the University of California Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, Berkeley, in August, 1939, the most powerful accelerator in the world at the time. Glenn T. Seaborg and Edwin McMillan (right) used it to discover plutonium, neptunium and many other transuranic elements and isotopes, for which they received the 1951 Nobel Prize in chemistry. The earliest operational circular accelerators were cyclotrons, invented in 1929 by Ernest Lawrence at the University of California, Berkeley. Cyclotrons have a single pair of hollow \\"D\\"-shaped plates to accelerate the particles and a single large dipole magnet to bend their path into a circular orbit. It is a characteristic property of charged particles in a uniform and constant magnetic field B that they orbit with a constant period, at a frequency called the cyclotron frequency, so long as their speed is small compared to the speed of light c. This means that the accelerating D's of a cyclotron can be driven at a constant frequency by a radio frequency (RF) accelerating power source, as the beam spirals outwards continuously. The particles are injected in the center of the magnet and are extracted at the outer edge at their maximum energy. Cyclotrons reach an energy limit because of relativistic effects whereby the particles effectively become more massive, so that their cyclotron frequency drops out of sync with the accelerating RF. Therefore, simple cyclotrons can accelerate protons only to an energy of around 15 million electron volts (15 MeV, corresponding to a speed of roughly 10% of c), because the protons get out of phase with the driving electric field. If accelerated further, the beam would continue to spiral outward to a larger radius but the particles would no longer gain enough speed to complete the larger circle in step with the accelerating RF. To accommodate relativistic effects the magnetic field needs to be increased to higher radii as is done in isochronous cyclotrons. An example of an isochronous cyclotron is the PSI Ring cyclotron in Switzerland, which provides protons at the energy of 590 MeV which corresponds to roughly 80% of the speed of light. The advantage of such a cyclotron is the maximum achievable extracted proton current which is currently 2.2 mA. The energy and current correspond to 1.3 MW beam power which is the highest of any accelerator currently existing. Synchrocyclotrons and isochronous cyclotrons A magnet in the synchrocyclotron at the Orsay proton therapy center A classic cyclotron can be modified to increase its energy limit. The historically first approach was the synchrocyclotron, which accelerates the particles in bunches. It uses a constant magnetic field B, but reduces the accelerating field's frequency so as to keep the particles in step as they spiral outward, matching their mass-dependent cyclotron resonance frequency. This approach suffers from low average beam intensity due to the bunching, and again from the need for a huge magnet of large radius and constant field over the larger orbit demanded by high energy. The second approach to the problem of accelerating relativistic particles is the isochronous cyclotron. In such a structure, the accelerating field's frequency (and the cyclotron resonance frequency) is kept constant for all energies by shaping the magnet poles so to increase magnetic field with radius. Thus, all particles get accelerated in isochronous time intervals. Higher energy particles travel a shorter distance in each orbit than they would in a classical cyclotron, thus remaining in phase with the accelerating field. The advantage of the isochronous cyclotron is that it can deliver continuous beams of higher average intensity, which is useful for some applications. The main disadvantages are the size and cost of the large magnet needed, and the difficulty in achieving the high magnetic field values required at the outer edge of the structure. Synchrocyclotrons have not been built since the isochronous cyclotron was developed. Synchrotrons Aerial photo of the Tevatron at Fermilab, which resembles a figure eight. The main accelerator is the ring above; the one below (about half the diameter, despite appearances) is for preliminary acceleration, beam cooling and storage, etc. To reach still higher energies, with relativistic mass approaching or exceeding the rest mass of the particles (for protons, billions of electron volts or GeV), it is necessary to use a synchrotron. This is an accelerator in which the particles are accelerated in a ring of constant radius. An immediate advantage over cyclotrons is that the magnetic field need only be present over the actual region of the particle orbits, which is much narrower than that of the ring. (The largest cyclotron built in the US had a magnet pole, whereas the diameter of synchrotrons such as the LEP and LHC is nearly 10 km. The aperture of the two beams of the LHC is of the order of a centimeter.) The LHC contains 16 RF cavities, 1232 superconducting dipole magnets for beam steering, and 24 quadrupoles for beam focusing.[\\"Pulling together: Superconducting electromagnets\\" CERN; https://home.cern/science/engineering/pulling-together- superconducting-electromagnets] Even at this size, the LHC is limited by its ability to steer the particles without them going adrift. This limit is theorized to occur at 14TeV.[\\"Restarting the LHC: Why 13 Tev?\\" CERN; https://home.cern/science/engineering/restarting-lhc-why-13-tev] However, since the particle momentum increases during acceleration, it is necessary to turn up the magnetic field B in proportion to maintain constant curvature of the orbit. In consequence, synchrotrons cannot accelerate particles continuously, as cyclotrons can, but must operate cyclically, supplying particles in bunches, which are delivered to a target or an external beam in beam \\"spills\\" typically every few seconds. Since high energy synchrotrons do most of their work on particles that are already traveling at nearly the speed of light c, the time to complete one orbit of the ring is nearly constant, as is the frequency of the RF cavity resonators used to drive the acceleration. In modern synchrotrons, the beam aperture is small and the magnetic field does not cover the entire area of the particle orbit as it does for a cyclotron, so several necessary functions can be separated. Instead of one huge magnet, one has a line of hundreds of bending magnets, enclosing (or enclosed by) vacuum connecting pipes. The design of synchrotrons was revolutionized in the early 1950s with the discovery of the strong focusing concept. The focusing of the beam is handled independently by specialized quadrupole magnets, while the acceleration itself is accomplished in separate RF sections, rather similar to short linear accelerators. Also, there is no necessity that cyclic machines be circular, but rather the beam pipe may have straight sections between magnets where beams may collide, be cooled, etc. This has developed into an entire separate subject, called \\"beam physics\\" or \\"beam optics\\". More complex modern synchrotrons such as the Tevatron, LEP, and LHC may deliver the particle bunches into storage rings of magnets with a constant magnetic field, where they can continue to orbit for long periods for experimentation or further acceleration. The highest-energy machines such as the Tevatron and LHC are actually accelerator complexes, with a cascade of specialized elements in series, including linear accelerators for initial beam creation, one or more low energy synchrotrons to reach intermediate energy, storage rings where beams can be accumulated or \\"cooled\\" (reducing the magnet aperture required and permitting tighter focusing; see beam cooling), and a last large ring for final acceleration and experimentation. Segment of an electron synchrotron at DESY =Electron synchrotrons= Circular electron accelerators fell somewhat out of favor for particle physics around the time that SLAC's linear particle accelerator was constructed, because their synchrotron losses were considered economically prohibitive and because their beam intensity was lower than for the unpulsed linear machines. The Cornell Electron Synchrotron, built at low cost in the late 1970s, was the first in a series of high-energy circular electron accelerators built for fundamental particle physics, the last being LEP, built at CERN, which was used from 1989 until 2000. A large number of electron synchrotrons have been built in the past two decades, as part of synchrotron light sources that emit ultraviolet light and X rays; see below. Storage rings For some applications, it is useful to store beams of high energy particles for some time (with modern high vacuum technology, up to many hours) without further acceleration. This is especially true for colliding beam accelerators, in which two beams moving in opposite directions are made to collide with each other, with a large gain in effective collision energy. Because relatively few collisions occur at each pass through the intersection point of the two beams, it is customary to first accelerate the beams to the desired energy, and then store them in storage rings, which are essentially synchrotron rings of magnets, with no significant RF power for acceleration. Synchrotron radiation sources Some circular accelerators have been built to deliberately generate radiation (called synchrotron light) as X-rays also called synchrotron radiation, for example the Diamond Light Source which has been built at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in England or the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, USA. High-energy X-rays are useful for X-ray spectroscopy of proteins or X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), for example. Synchrotron radiation is more powerfully emitted by lighter particles, so these accelerators are invariably electron accelerators. Synchrotron radiation allows for better imaging as researched and developed at SLAC's SPEAR. Fixed-Field Alternating Gradient Accelerators Fixed-Field Alternating Gradient accelerators (FFA)s, in which a magnetic field which is fixed in time, but with a radial variation to achieve strong focusing, allows the beam to be accelerated with a high repetition rate but in a much smaller radial spread than in the cyclotron case. Isochronous FFAs, like isochronous cyclotrons, achieve continuous beam operation, but without the need for a huge dipole bending magnet covering the entire radius of the orbits. Some new developments in FFAs are covered in. History Ernest Lawrence's first cyclotron was a mere 4 inches (100 mm) in diameter. Later, in 1939, he built a machine with a 60-inch diameter pole face, and planned one with a 184-inch diameter in 1942, which was, however, taken over for World War II-related work connected with uranium isotope separation; after the war it continued in service for research and medicine over many years. The first large proton synchrotron was the Cosmotron at Brookhaven National Laboratory, which accelerated protons to about 3 GeV (1953‚Äì1968). The Bevatron at Berkeley, completed in 1954, was specifically designed to accelerate protons to sufficient energy to create antiprotons, and verify the particle-antiparticle symmetry of nature, then only theorized. The Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) at Brookhaven (1960‚Äì) was the first large synchrotron with alternating gradient, \\"strong focusing\\" magnets, which greatly reduced the required aperture of the beam, and correspondingly the size and cost of the bending magnets. The Proton Synchrotron, built at CERN (1959‚Äì), was the first major European particle accelerator and generally similar to the AGS. The Stanford Linear Accelerator, SLAC, became operational in 1966, accelerating electrons to 30 GeV in a 3 km long waveguide, buried in a tunnel and powered by hundreds of large klystrons. It is still the largest linear accelerator in existence, and has been upgraded with the addition of storage rings and an electron-positron collider facility. It is also an X-ray and UV synchrotron photon source. The Fermilab Tevatron has a ring with a beam path of . It has received several upgrades, and has functioned as a proton- antiproton collider until it was shut down due to budget cuts on September 30, 2011. The largest circular accelerator ever built was the LEP synchrotron at CERN with a circumference 26.6 kilometers, which was an electron/positron collider. It achieved an energy of 209 GeV before it was dismantled in 2000 so that the tunnel could be used for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The LHC is a proton collider, and currently the world's largest and highest-energy accelerator, achieving 6.5 TeV energy per beam (13 TeV in total). The aborted Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) in Texas would have had a circumference of 87 km. Construction was started in 1991, but abandoned in 1993. Very large circular accelerators are invariably built in tunnels a few metres wide to minimize the disruption and cost of building such a structure on the surface, and to provide shielding against intense secondary radiations that occur, which are extremely penetrating at high energies. Current accelerators such as the Spallation Neutron Source, incorporate superconducting cryomodules. The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, and Large Hadron Collider also make use of superconducting magnets and RF cavity resonators to accelerate particles. Targets and detectors The output of a particle accelerator can generally be directed towards multiple lines of experiments, one at a given time, by means of a deviating electromagnet. This makes it possible to operate multiple experiments without needing to move things around or shutting down the entire accelerator beam. Except for synchrotron radiation sources, the purpose of an accelerator is to generate high-energy particles for interaction with matter. This is usually a fixed target, such as the phosphor coating on the back of the screen in the case of a television tube; a piece of uranium in an accelerator designed as a neutron source; or a tungsten target for an X-ray generator. In a linac, the target is simply fitted to the end of the accelerator. The particle track in a cyclotron is a spiral outwards from the centre of the circular machine, so the accelerated particles emerge from a fixed point as for a linear accelerator. For synchrotrons, the situation is more complex. Particles are accelerated to the desired energy. Then, a fast acting dipole magnet is used to switch the particles out of the circular synchrotron tube and towards the target. A variation commonly used for particle physics research is a collider, also called a storage ring collider. Two circular synchrotrons are built in close proximityusually on top of each other and using the same magnets (which are then of more complicated design to accommodate both beam tubes). Bunches of particles travel in opposite directions around the two accelerators and collide at intersections between them. This can increase the energy enormously; whereas in a fixed-target experiment the energy available to produce new particles is proportional to the square root of the beam energy, in a collider the available energy is linear. Higher energies Livingston chart depicting progress in collision energy through 2010. The LHC is the largest collision energy to date, but also represents the first break in the log-linear trend. At present the highest energy accelerators are all circular colliders, but both hadron accelerators and electron accelerators are running into limits. Higher energy hadron and ion cyclic accelerators will require accelerator tunnels of larger physical size due to the increased beam rigidity. For cyclic electron accelerators, a limit on practical bend radius is placed by synchrotron radiation losses and the next generation will probably be linear accelerators 10 times the current length. An example of such a next generation electron accelerator is the proposed 40 km long International Linear Collider. It is believed that plasma wakefield acceleration in the form of electron-beam \\"afterburners\\" and standalone laser pulsers might be able to provide dramatic increases in efficiency over RF accelerators within two to three decades. In plasma wakefield accelerators, the beam cavity is filled with a plasma (rather than vacuum). A short pulse of electrons or laser light either constitutes or immediately precedes the particles that are being accelerated. The pulse disrupts the plasma, causing the charged particles in the plasma to integrate into and move toward the rear of the bunch of particles that are being accelerated. This process transfers energy to the particle bunch, accelerating it further, and continues as long as the pulse is coherent. Energy gradients as steep as 200 GeV/m have been achieved over millimeter-scale distances using laser pulsers and gradients approaching 1 GeV/m are being produced on the multi-centimeter-scale with electron-beam systems, in contrast to a limit of about 0.1 GeV/m for radio-frequency acceleration alone. Existing electron accelerators such as SLAC could use electron-beam afterburners to greatly increase the energy of their particle beams, at the cost of beam intensity. Electron systems in general can provide tightly collimated, reliable beams; laser systems may offer more power and compactness. Thus, plasma wakefield accelerators could be used ‚Äì if technical issues can be resolved ‚Äì to both increase the maximum energy of the largest accelerators and to bring high energies into university laboratories and medical centres. Higher than 0.25 GeV/m gradients have been achieved by a dielectric laser accelerator, which may present another viable approach to building compact high-energy accelerators. Using femtosecond duration laser pulses, an electron accelerating gradient 0.69 Gev/m was recorded for dielectric laser accelerators. Higher gradients of the order of 1 to 6 GeV/m are anticipated after further optimizations. =Black hole production and public safety concerns= In the future, the possibility of a black hole production at the highest energy accelerators may arise if certain predictions of superstring theory are accurate. This and other possibilities have led to public safety concerns that have been widely reported in connection with the LHC, which began operation in 2008. The various possible dangerous scenarios have been assessed as presenting \\"no conceivable danger\\" in the latest risk assessment produced by the LHC Safety Assessment Group. If black holes are produced, it is theoretically predicted that such small black holes should evaporate extremely quickly via Bekenstein-Hawking radiation, but which is as yet experimentally unconfirmed. If colliders can produce black holes, cosmic rays (and particularly ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, UHECRs) must have been producing them for eons, but they have yet to harm anybody. It has been argued that to conserve energy and momentum, any black holes created in a collision between an UHECR and local matter would necessarily be produced moving at relativistic speed with respect to the Earth, and should escape into space, as their accretion and growth rate should be very slow, while black holes produced in colliders (with components of equal mass) would have some chance of having a velocity less than Earth escape velocity, 11.2 km per sec, and would be liable to capture and subsequent growth. Yet even on such scenarios the collisions of UHECRs with white dwarfs and neutron stars would lead to their rapid destruction, but these bodies are observed to be common astronomical objects. Thus if stable micro black holes should be produced, they must grow far too slowly to cause any noticeable macroscopic effects within the natural lifetime of the solar system. Accelerator operator An accelerator operator controls the operation of a particle accelerator used in research experiments, reviews an experiment schedule to determine experiment parameters specified by an experimenter (physicist), adjust particle beam parameters such as aspect ratio, current intensity, and position on target, communicates with and assists accelerator maintenance personnel to ensure readiness of support systems, such as vacuum, magnet power supplies and controls, low conductivity water (LCW) cooling, and radiofrequency power supplies and controls. Additionally, the accelerator operator maintains a record of accelerator related events.

Hamilton's poor leadership, arrogance, and financial mismanagement are viewed by many as the main reason the Vols football program hit an all-time low during his tenure, from which it has not recovered. Hamilton's duties as an AD were tested when he decided to fire longtime Tennessee football coach Phillip Fulmer. Fulmer was one of Tennessee's winningest head coaches at the time of his dismissal and although many called for his firing after two losing seasons in four years there were also many in his support. Hamilton chose Lane Kiffin as Tennessee's next head coach in December 2008. Many did not believe Kiffin to be the best hire as there were other highly rated potential candidates at the time not to mention Kiffin's controversial history with past coaching jobs. Hamilton's decision would be disastrous as after only one season at Tennessee Kiffin resigned to take the same job at the University of Southern California. Due to a poorly written contract, Kiffin only owed Tennessee $800,000 upon leaving. http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=4821378 Hamilton controversially hired Derek Dooley following Kiffin's departure, despite his losing record at Louisiana Tech. The pressure would come to a boil in March 2011 when in the middle of the NCAA's investigation into sanctions against basketball coach Bruce Pearl and but one day before the team was scheduled to face the Michigan Wolverines in the second round of the 2011 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, Hamilton announced that Pearl's status as coach going into the game was not certain and at season's end he would be evaluated. Hamilton was scrutinized for making this statement before the team played in the tournament as the pressure it would put on the team may have been the deciding factor in their lopsided 30-point loss to the Wolverines the following day. On the Monday following the game Pearl was dismissed from Tennessee and not soon after Hamilton announced his resignation. Even though Mike Hamilton should not have received any \\"buyout\\" with a resignation, University of Tennessee Knoxville Chancellor Jimmy Cheek provided him over $1.3 million in severance, to the confusion and surprise of many.http://www.govolsxtra.com/news/2011/jun/07/john-adams-buyout-just- resigning-really/ References 1963 births Living people Clemson University alumni People from Brevard, North Carolina Tennessee Volunteers and Lady Volunteers athletic directors ","title":"Mike Hamilton (athletic director)"},{"id":"18589043","text":"The Te Huka Geothermal Power Station, also known as Tauhara One, is a 23 MW binary cycle geothermal power station situated near Taupo, New Zealand.

He was a Nationalist Party member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1929 to 1931, representing the electorate of Darling Downs. Morgan was born at Warwick, son of Premier of Queensland Sir Arthur Morgan and grandson of Queensland colonial MP James Morgan. He received a state school education at Warwick and was attached to the staff of the state Hansard and the state parliament for several years until 1904 before going to work for his family's newspaper, the Warwick Argus, as an apprentice journalist and then a sub- editor from 1910 to 1914, after which his family sold the newspaper. He served a term as a Town of Warwick councillor and was an unsuccessful Kidstonite candidate for the Legislative Assembly in 1908. Morgan enlisted for service in World War I on 7 February 1915 and embarked with the 11th Light Horse Regiment reinforcements on 2 June 1915. He served in the Gallipoli campaign and in Palestine before being invalided home in early 1917. After the war, he returned to journalism, initially as associate editor of the Daily Mail in Brisbane from 1918 to 1921, then as editor of the new Graziers' Review from 1921 to 1927, and finally as editor of the Brisbane Sun from 1927 until his election to parliament. In 1929, Morgan was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the Nationalist member for Darling Downs, defeating sitting member Littleton Groom, who was running as an independent. He was a member of the Select Committee on the Tobacco Industry from 1923 to 1930. He held the seat until his defeat by Groom, again running as an independent, in 1931. He was touted as a potential candidate for seats in the early-to-mid-1930s, but this did nor occur. Morgan died in 1957. He married Anna Hobbs in 1907; they had two sons and two daughters.

He is best known for his performances in 1967 when he won two of the most important European races for three-year-olds; the Irish Derby and the St Leger. Ribocco briefly held the record for prize money won by a British-trained racehorse. Background Ribocco was a small, powerfully built bay horse bred at the Idle Hour Farm in Paris, Kentucky by Mrs J. G. (Margaret) Rogers. As a yearling, he was sent to the Keeneland sales where he was bought for $35,000 by Charles W. Engelhard, Jr.. He was a son of the undefeated dual Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Ribot out of the mare Libra. Libra won one minor race before becoming a notable broodmare, producing Ribero (Irish Derby, St Leger) and Libra's Rib (Princess of Wales's Stakes). Ribocco was sent to England to be trained by Fulke Johnson Houghton at Blewbury in Berkshire. Racing career=1966: two-year-old career= Ribocco made his racecourse debut in July when he won a maiden race at Newbury and returned to the same course a month later to win the Washington Singer Stakes. In September, he was moved up in class to contest the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster and finished second to the Irish-bred Bold Lad. On his final start of the year, Ribocco returned to Doncaster for the Observer Gold Cup, Britain's most valuable race for two-year-olds. He established himself as one of the best colts of his generation with a win. In the Free Handicap, an end- of-season ranking of the best British two-year-olds, Ribocco ranked third behind Bold Lad and Royal Palace. =1967: three-year-old season= In the spring of 1967, Ribocco did not win. He was well beaten in the Craven Stakes, the Dee Stakes, and the Lingfield Derby Trial. His odds for the Derby drifted out despite the booking of Britain's leading jockey, Lester Piggott, to ride him in the race. At Epsom, Ribocco started at odds of 22/1 in a field of twenty-two runners. Piggott held the colt up in the early stages before moving him to the wide outside on the turn into the straight. Ribocco ran on strongly to challenge for the lead a furlong from the finish and take second place, beaten two and a half lengths by the favourite, Royal Palace. Later in the month, Ribocco started favourite for the Irish Derby at the Curragh in front of a crowd of 60,000 which included the visiting Jackie Kennedy. He produced a strong finish to overtake Sucaryl inside the final furlong and win by a length. At Ascot in July, Ribocco started favourite for Britain's most important weight-for-age race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. He finished third, beaten three lengths and a neck by the four-year-olds Busted and Salvo. Ribocco was then aimed at the third leg of British Triple Crown series, the St Leger at Doncaster. In a prep race in August, he finished third to Dart Board in the March Stakes at Goodwood. In the St Leger, he started 7/2 joint favourite with the Queen's colt Hopeful Venture. Piggott sent Ribocco into the lead in the straight, and he won, beating Hopeful Venture by one and a half lengths. In October, he was sent to compete in France in that country's most prestigious race where he finished third in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, beaten in a three-way photo finish by the 82/1 winner, Topyo, and Salvo. In his final race, Ribocco returned to the land of his birth and finished seventh in the Washington, D.C. International. Assessment and achievements Ribocco's prize money for finishing third in the Arc de Triomphe took his earnings to ¬£155,669, passing the record for a British or Irish racehorse set by Santa Claus in 1964. His place at the top of the list was short-lived as he was overtaken by Royal Palace in the summer of 1968. Stud record Ribocco was retired at the end of the 1967 racing season. American Thomas Mellon Evans acquired a part interest in him for breeding purposes. He stood at stud at Evans' Buckland Farm in Virginia, where he met with modest success as a sire, with the best of his progeny including Ripon (John B. Campbell Handicap). After the 1972 breeding season, he was sent to a stud farm in Japan.

Phase 3 Program in Anxiety has Started, 2000 http://www.evaluategroup.com/Universal/View.aspx?type=Story&id;=29979 Deramciclane is a unique alternative to current anxiolytics on the market because it has a novel chemical structure and target. It acts as an antagonist at the 5-HT2A receptor, as an inverse agonist at the 5-HT2C receptor, and as a GABA reuptake inhibitor. The two serotonin receptors are G protein-coupled receptors and are two of the main excitatory serotonin receptor types. Their excitation has been implicated in anxiety and mood. Deramciclane does not affect CYP3A4 activity in metabolizing other drugs, but it is a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Some studies also show the drug to have moderate affinity to dopamine D2 receptors and low affinity to dopamine receptor D1. Researchers are looking for alternatives to benzodiazepines for anxiolytic use because benzodiazepine drugs have sedative and muscle relaxant side effects. Commercial history Deramciclane was discovered by EGIS Pharmaceuticals Ltd in Budapest, Hungary. In 2000, EGIS signed over exclusive rights to Orion Pharma to further develop, register, and market deramciclane. Successful pre- clinical, Phase I, and Phase II trials looked promising to the company and its investors even up until the third quarter of 2002.Blow to Orion as deramciclane fails in Phase III anxiety studies, 2003 http://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/blow-to-orion-as-deramciclane-fails-in- phase-iii-anxiety-studies Phase I studies show little to no side effects of deramciclane. Phase II studies show little to no side effects and statistically significant improvement on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale in response to daily 60 mg doses, but not in response to daily 10 or 30 mg doses. Finally, in February, 2003, deramciclane development for use against general anxiety disorder (GAD) was discontinued during Phase III trials due to clinically insignificant results compared to placebo groups. Pharmacokinetics of deramciclane There have been several clinical studies to examine the pharmacokinetics of deramciclane, which can readily cross the blood-brain barrier. Overall, studies show that deramciclane follows linear pharmacokinetics in humans with oral daily doses ranging from 3‚Äì150 mg and twice daily doses ranging from 10‚Äì60 mg. Additionally, no differences have been found in adsorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination when an oral dose is administered in tablet or capsule form. Deramciclane is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Studies show that the drug can be detected in plasma as quickly as 20 minutes after dosing. Deramciclane demonstrates a Tmax of 2‚Äì4 hours and is unaffected by dosage. The Cmax at this time is approximately 140 ng/mL. A typical PTF (peak trough fluctuation) is 70-80% over four weeks of administration, and is unaffected by dose. The oral tablet of deramciclane yields a bioavailability of 36% on average, which is considered decent enough for oral administration and avoid the necessity of a more invasive route. The pharmacokinetics of deramciclane are also studied in rats, mice, rabbits, and dogs. Rat and rabbits show the fastest metabolism rates of the drug, and dogs are the only animals to show non-linear pharmacokinetics of deramciclane. Phase I metabolism in rat hepatocytes is similar enough to that in humans that the rat can be used as a predictive model for human metabolism of deramciclane. In rats, the Tmax is found to be 0.5 hours after a single 10 mg/kg dose and the half-life of deramciclane is about 3.5-5.5 hours. As expected, deramciclane reaches greatest peak plasma concentrations with intravenous administration, followed by intraperitoneal, then oral administration with the lowest peak plasma concentration. Studies assessing the elimination half-life of deramciclane point to a range of 20‚Äì32 hours for T1/2. The elimination half-life appears to increase with dosage. There is some evidence for accumulation of deramciclane, though it is a topic of debate. =Metabolism= It is important to understand the metabolism pathway of a drug to better understand its pharmacology, toxicity, and animal model predictability. The metabolism pathway in humans is not entirely clear, though certain reactions have been shown to happen in the breakdown of deramciclane. For example, deramciclane undergoes side chain modification and oxidation at multiple positions on the molecule. The side chain reaction forms phenylborneol and N-desmethyl deramciclane which is the active metabolite of deramciclane. Oxidation of the molecule results in many hydroxy-, carboxy-, and N-oxide derivatives. =Food interaction= Also important to the pharmacokinetics of a drug is its interactions with food during adsorption because this affects the dosage required. Deramciclane is an acid-labile compound. Acid-labile compounds are more easily broken down in acidic environments, so the decrease in stomach pH as a result of the presence of food could have adverse effects on the bioavailability of deramciclane. Clinical studies investigating the effects of food or lack thereof on deramciclane adsorption show that there is a statistically significant, but not clinically relevant, increase in bioavailability of deramciclane when administered with food because the point of critical instability of deramciclane is relatively low at a pH of 2. The presence of food does not affect deramciclane's elimination half-life (T1/2) or mean residence time (MRT). Safety and side effects All clinical studies have shown that deramciclane is well tolerated in humans at dosages ranging between 0.2‚Äì150 mg. All reported side effects were mild-moderate with the most common side effect being headache and dizziness. No severe side effects were reported in any clinical trial, and no side effects were found to be dose-dependent. Trial participants showed no significant increases in liver enzyme activity and no changes in ECGs, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, or LDL cholesterol levels. Another advantage to deramciclane is that it did not produce any withdrawal effects after long-term studies, like other anxiolytics do.

Work  His research includes the use of fractal patterns in African architecture, art, and religion, and the relationships between indigenous cultures and modern technology, such as that between Native American cultural and spiritual practices and cybernetics. He holds a bachelor's degree in cybernetics and a master's in systems engineering both at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a Ph.D. in history of consciousness at the University of California, Santa Cruz. A Fulbright fellowship enabled his postdoctoral field research on African ethnomathematics, which was later published in the book African Fractals: Modern Computing and Indigenous Design. Dr. Eglash has also conducted studies in teaching children math and computing through simulations of indigenous and vernacular cultural practices. He explains that the simulations do not impose math externally, but rather translate the mathematical ideas already present in the cultural practices to their equivalent form in school-taught math. Examples include transformational geometry in cornrow braiding, spiral arcs in graffiti, least common multiples in percussion rhythms, and analytic geometry in Native American beadwork. His approach is one of many attempts to draw the inspiration to learn out of students' own cultural backgrounds. He also studies social justice issues as they manifest in the practice of science and technology, ranging from the ethnic identity of ‚Äúnerds‚Äù to the so-called appropriation of science and technology by groups disempowered on the basis of race, class, gender.

Pictures from both reunions and current information about former employees is available at the website - www.sireunion.org. Beginnings Systematics was founded in 1968 by University of Arkansas graduate Walter Smiley, who learned of the high software costs and other difficulties faced by small banks in trying to use data processing software from his experiences working with IBM and in the banking industry. Smiley recognized a niche that could be filled for medium- sized banks in this space, and sought funding to start his own company. Through Jon Jacoby, Smiley was introduced to the Stephens family, who agreed to invest $400,000 in Walter and Systematics in return for 80% equity stake. Systematics distinguished itself early on from other players in the industry. \\"In the data processing business,\\" according to Walter, \\"it‚Äôs real easy to get yourself in a position where you‚Äôve got to sell for tomorrow for the sake of today.

History  Like many influential grassroots bands before them, Indorphine began in the garage of lead singer Jimmy Grant as he, and high school friend and drummer Everett Sailor, annoyed their Kissimmee neighbors with their loud and abstract music. One day however a neighbor from across the street, interested instead of disgusted in the odd noises resonating daily, introduced himself as Buddy Fischel to the already named duo Indorphine with an interest in jamming their socks off. An experienced guitar player from Syracuse, NY, Indorphine was almost complete with the addition of Buddy, yet they still needed someone to shred. Adam Phillips, another New Yorker and guitar virtuoso was one of Indorphine‚Äôs earliest diehard local fans until the beginnings of Indorphine heard his extensive talent and made him an official member. After Indorphine‚Äôs first bass player left the band over boredom, current bass player and vocalist Indiana native Tanner Owings took a chance leaving the very popular Orlando band Milka to explore his options with the experimental Indorphine; completing today‚Äôs lineup. Shortly after the Holiday Hate Tour with Psychostick and Screaming Mechanical Brain in 2007, Indorphine suddenly, and without notice, disbanded. Two months later Jimmy Grant resurfaced as the new bassist for Psychostick - a position he would quit in December 2009. In September 2010, Jimmy Grant posted a video, hinting at Indorphine reuniting with its five original members. Jimmy, along with Tanner Owings and Everett Sailor, have been working on a concept album entitled Cowboy Maloney's Electric City vs. The Chocolate Chewbaccapocalypse for the past few months. The band made their live return on January 7 with new guitarist Marshall Stephens, as Buddy would not be rejoining the band due to family life. The band made another live appearance in February 2012. In 2019. Indorphine returned once again and will play another live show on December 6th at The Haven in Orlando.  Stage Show  Indorphine was heavily known in the southeast as one of the best metal bands to see live. The stage show consisted of swapping instruments with each other for different songs. One example of that would be the song 'Kingdoms Fall'. Jimmy Grant (vocals) plays bass on this track while Tanner Owings (bass) sings it. Also 'Porticulture' (aka. the Punk rock song) features Buddy on vocals and Tanner on guitar.

Jacks, directed by Henry Hathaway, that stars James Mason, Janet Leigh, Robert Wagner, Debra Paget, and Sterling Hayden. The film is based on the King Features syndicated newspaper comic strip of the same name by Hal Foster. Plot Usurper Sligon (Primo Carnera), a worshipper of the old Norse god pantheon, along with other rebel Vikings, have forced into exile the Christian royal family of the Viking kingdom of Scandia: King Aguar (Donald Crisp), his wife, and their son Prince Valiant (Robert Wagner). Aguar and his family come under the protection of King Arthur (Brian Aherne). When Valiant has grown to a man, he is sent to Camelot to undergo training as a knight under the tutelage of Aguar's family friend, the noble knight of the Round Table, Sir Gawain (Sterling Hayden). During his wanderings, Valiant witnesses a clandestine meeting between a group of Sligon's Vikings and a black-clad knight. Valiant is discovered by the Vikings, but with slyness and improvisation he manages to elude his pursuers. During his flight, Valiant runs into Gawain. After Valiant convinces Gawain that he is indeed the son of Aguar, Gawain listens to the prince's story of the mysterious Black Knight, a knight known only in rumor in Camelot. He takes Valiant to King Arthur, who is informed of the Black Knight's activities. Arthur decrees that Valiant be trained as a prospective knight by undergoing the rigors of squirehood. One of Arthur's knights, Sir Brack (James Mason), takes an extraordinary interest in Valiant and offers to train him, but Valiant is instead assigned to Gawain. Some time later, Sir Brack offers to take Valiant to the place where the young prince has seen the Black Knight in order to backtrack the mysterious figure. Once there, they separate, but shortly afterwards Valiant is ambushed by a group of bowmen and barely escapes with his life and an arrow in his back. He stumbles into the territory of King Luke (Barry Jones) and is taken in by his daughters, Aleta (Janet Leigh) and Ilene (Debra Paget). Upon his recovery, Aleta and Valiant fall in love, but King Luke disapproves of Valiant's Viking origin and so their relationship must remain a secret for the time being. From Aleta, Valiant also learns that her younger sister Ilene is secretly attracted to Sir Gawain. Valiant returns to Camelot and discovers, to his shock, that Gawain, who had grown worried over his squire, had tried to find him and had also run into an ambush by the Black Knight. Like Valiant, he escaped within an inch of his life. Noting that Sir Brack had temporarily disappeared around the same time, Valiant becomes suspicious, but on the advice of Gawain he suppresses his suspicion. Some time later, Aleta and Ilene come to Camelot to attend a tournament held in their honor; as an added prize, the winner of this joust will win Aleta's hand. Valiant dons the armor of Gawain, who is too seriously wounded to participate, in order to win Aleta, but he fails and is unmasked. But then another contender appears and wins the bout before falling off his horse; this knight turns out to be Sir Gawain. Awakening on his sickbed, Gawain beholds Aleta and falls head over heels in love with her, and out of respect for his patron Valiant does not dare tell him the truth. For his act of presumption, Valiant is punished by being confined to his quarters and attending to his master. A mysterious messenger comes to the castle to see Sir Brack, and the same night King Aguar's seal is thrown through the window of Sir Gawain's chambers and lands at Valiant's feet. Realizing that his parents are in trouble, Valiant immediately leaves Camelot, leaving a bewildered Aleta behind. But as he prepares to return to his home, he is ambushed and captured by Sligon's Vikings and the Black Knight, who reveals himself as Sir Brack. Brack has made a pact with Sligon: For delivering King Aguar's family, Sligon will assist Brack in conquering Camelot and thus becoming the King over Britain. Shortly, Aleta, who is unwilling to let Valiant run off, arrives at the scene and is captured, and the two are brought to Thule, where Sligon prepares to execute them and Valiant's captured parents. However, a group of Christian Vikings, led by Aguar and Valiant's old friend Boltar (Victor McLaglen), stage a revolution, and Boltar infiltrates the castle. Valiant manages to escape his cell and team up with Boltar, who intends to assassinate Sligon and have Valiant give the attack signal to their cohorts once Sligon has fallen. But Valiant is discovered before Boltar manages to kill Sligon, and during his struggle with a guard a false signal is given, which makes the Christian Vikings attack prematurely. Just as things seem bleak, Valiant manages to set fire to several parts of the castle, throwing the defenders into confusion, and is able to slay Sligon in single combat. Some time later, Valiant returns to Camelot with Aleta and accuses Sir Brack of treachery before the king and the assembled Round Table. Sir Brack calls for a trial by combat to the death, and despite Gawain's protests and his offer to fight in Valiant's stead, the young prince accepts the challenge. After a long and protracted fight, Valiant succeeds in killing the traitor with his father's mystical broadsword, the Singing Sword. He offers Aleta back to his master, but Gawain stays his hand. During the long period of worry over their loved ones, the older knight has finally come to learn the truth, and he and Ilene have fallen in love. In the end, having redeemed his honor by exposing the traitor, Valiant is made a fully privileged Knight of the Round Table.

The film was the idea of producer Robert Jacks, who was the son in law of Fox head Darryl F. Zanuck. Fox bought the rights to eight years of published comic strip stories, but only adapted a 1937 storyline. In December 1952 Henry Hathaway was assigned as director. Medieval swashbucklers had been an experiencing a recent surge of popularity since the success of MGM's Ivanhoe (1952). In January 1953 Fox announced the film would be shot in CinemaScope. In March 1953 Robert Wagner was announced to star in the title role. Along with The Robe it would be the studio's biggest production of the year, with a budget of $3 million. Michael Rennie was going to play King Arthur and Robert Newton Bolthar. Hathaway and producer Robert Jacks left for England in April to scout locations. Eventually, neither Rennie or Newton would appear in the final film. The castle was constructed at a cost of $83,000. The castle battle sequence cost $250,000. Filming started July 7, 1953 on the Fox backlot although Hathaway shot background footage in Scotland from April through to June. The shoot took until November 1953. Wagner had his hair cut to match that in the comic strip. The actor later joked \\"Dean Martin passed me on the lot and thought I was Jane Wyman\\". In March 1954 Zanuck announced Fox would make a sequel, Valiant and Aleta dealing with Valiant's married life with Aleta. This film was never made. Reception=Box Office= According to contemporary reports the film made $2.6 million in North America, which did not recoup its reported cost of $2.9 million. =Critical= Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote that the film was a faithful adaptation of the comic strip, and that the best part were the epic action scenes. He observed that the film would satisfy younger viewers. Variety wrote: \\"Although the picture comes in a bit overlength at 100 minutes, the direction and Dudley Nichols' scripting combine to bring it off acceptably against some rather dazzling settings, including authentic castles actually lensed in England\\". A rave review in Harrison's Reports called it \\"one of the most exciting and thrilling action-filled romantic adventure melodramas ever brought to the screen\\", and called Wagner \\"a human dynamo\\" in the title role. John McCarten of The New Yorker wrote in a negative review of the film that \\"as it flounders about, it cuts some unintentionally comic capers that might amuse you if you are feeling amiable ... Prince Valiant is played by Robert Wagner, who reads his lines in a vacant monotone and wears a long Dutch bob and a jerkin with the skittish air of a man trying to be funny in a lady's hat\\". The Monthly Film Bulletin declared, \\"Judged as an articulated comic strip, the film is intermittently amusing; by any other standards, it is merely a tasteless costume-piece\\".

Chapin House, also known as Chapin Mansion, is a historic house in Niles, Michigan. It was listed as a Michigan State Historic Site in 1976, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. History Henry A. Chapin was born in Leyden, Massachusetts in 1813 and moved with his parents to Ohio in 1814. In 1834, Chapin moved to Edwardsburg, Michigan, a few miles east of Niles, and started a general store. Ten years later, he entered into a partnership with S. S. Griffin and opened a wool business and general store in Niles. The business failed in 181, but by 1864 Chapin was out of debt and again prosperous. In 1865 he purchased a tract of land in the Upper Peninsula near Iron Mountain. In 1878 an immense lode of iron ore was discovered on Chapin's property, and the Chapin Mine was quickly organized. Chapin did not own or operate the mine, but he did receive royalties of amounting to $100,000 to $300,000 annually throughout the rest of his lifetime. (note: large pdf file) Chapin began construction on this house, designed by the Chicago firm of Wheelock & Clay, in 1882. The house was finished in 1884, and Chapin lived in it until his death in 1898. The house was donated to the city of Niles in 1933, and it served as the Niles City Hall from a point between 1933 and 1937 until December 7, 2012. In May 2013, the administration of the mansion was turned over to the Niles History Center, and the mansion was opened to the public. Description The Chapin House is a three-story red brick Queen Anne structure with slate, wood, and terra cotta trimmings. It sits on a Bedford blue stone foundation, and is capped with a hipped roof. The structure has a turreted, round corner tower and a number of projecting and recessed porches and semi-hexagonal bay window units. On the interior, the first floor originally contained an entrance hall flanked by a parlor and library, a stair hall, a sitting room, dining room, kitchen and pantry. The second floor contained an upper stair hall surrounded by four large bedchambers and quarters for servants in the rear. The third floor contained a ballroom. The interior remains virtually unaltered, despite the use as the Niles City Hall for over 70 years. Fort St. Joseph Museum The museum is located in the carriage house of the Chapin Mansion and focuses on the city's history. Exhibits include Fort St. Joseph, built by the French as a trading post in 1691, the Underground Railroad in southern Michigan, area railroads and artifacts of the Lakota people.

Shown here with a meat pie. Lunch, an abbreviation for luncheon, is a meal eaten around midday. During the 20th century, the meaning gradually narrowed to a meal eaten midday. Lunch is commonly the second meal of the day, after breakfast. The meal varies in size depending on the culture, and significant variations exist in different areas of the world. Etymology A Swedish outdoor picnic The abbreviation lunch is taken from the more formal Northern English word luncheon, which is derived from the Anglo-Saxon word nuncheon or nunchin meaning 'noon drink'. The term has been in common use since 1823. The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) reports usage of the words beginning in 1580 to describe a meal that was eaten between more substantial meals. It may also mean a piece of cheese or bread.Online Etymology \\"luncheon\\", etymonline.com In medieval Germany, there are references to similariar, a sir lunchentach according to the OED, a noon draughtof ale, with breadan extra meal between midday dinner and supper, especially during the long hours of hard labour during haying or early harvesting. History Meals have become ingrained in each society as being natural and logical. What one society eats may seem extraordinary to another. The same is true of what was eaten long ago in history as food tastes, menu items and meal periods have changed greatly over time. During the Middle Ages the main meal of the day, then called dinner, for almost everyone took place late in the morning after several hours of work, when there was no need for artificial lighting. In the early to mid-17th century the meal could be any time between late morning and mid-afternoon. During the late 17th and 18th centuries, this meal was gradually pushed back into the evening, creating a greater time gap between breakfast and dinner. A meal called lunch came to fill the gap. The late evening meal, called supper, became squeezed out as dinner advanced into the evening, and often became a snack. But formal \\"supper parties\\", artificially lit by candles, sometimes with entertainment, persisted as late as the Regency era, and a ball normally included supper, often served very late. Up until the early 19th century, luncheon was generally reserved for the ladies, who would often have lunch with one another when their husbands were out. The meal was often rather light, and often included left-overs from the previous night's dinner, which were often plentiful. As late as 1945, Emily Post wrote in the magazine Etiquette that luncheon is \\"generally given by and for women, but it is not unusual, especially in summer places or in town on Saturday or Sunday, to include an equal number of men\\"hence the mildly disparaging phrase, \\"the ladies who lunch\\". Lunch was a ladies' light meal; when the Prince of Wales stopped to eat a dainty luncheon with lady friends, he was laughed at for this effeminacy. Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, a guide to all aspects of running a household in Victorian Britain Beginning in the 1840s, afternoon tea supplemented this luncheon at four o'clock. Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management (1861)a guide to all aspects of running a household in Victorian Britain, edited by Isabella Beetonhad much less to explain about luncheon than about dinners or ball suppers: =Modern lunch= With the growth of industrialisation in the 19th century, male workers began to work long shifts at the factory, severely disrupting the age-old eating habits of rural life. Initially, workers were sent home for a brief dinner provided by their wives, but as the workplace was moved farther from the home, working men took to providing themselves with something portable to eat during a break in the middle of the day. The lunch meal slowly became institutionalised in England when workers with long and fixed hour jobs at the factory were eventually given an hour off work to eat lunch and thus gain strength for the afternoon shift. Stalls and later chop houses near the factories began to provide mass- produced food for the working class, and the meal soon became an established part of the daily routine, remaining so to this day. In many countries and regions lunch is the dinner or main meal. Prescribed lunchtimes allow workers to return to their homes to eat with their families. Consequently, where lunch is the customary main meal of the day, businesses close during lunchtime. Lunch also becomes dinner on special days, such as holidays or special events, including, for example, Christmas dinner and harvest dinners such as Thanksgiving; on these special days, dinner is usually served in early afternoon. The main meal on Sunday, whether at a restaurant or at home, is called \\"Sunday dinner\\", and for Christians is served after morning church services. Around the world=Asia= A traditional Bengali lunch is a seven-course meal. Bengali cuisine is a culinary style originating in Bengal, a region in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent, which is now divided between Bangladesh and Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura, Assam's Barak Valley. The first course is shukto, which is a mix of vegetables cooked with few spices and topped with a coconut sauce. The second course consists of rice, dal, and a vegetable curry. The third course consists of rice and fish curry. The fourth course is that of rice and meat curry (generally chevon, mutton, chicken or lamb). The fifth course contains sweet preparations like rasgulla, pantua, rajbhog, sandesh, etc. The sixth course consists of payesh or mishti doi (sweet yogurt). The seventh course is that of paan, which acts as a mouth freshener. In China today, lunch is not nearly as complicated as it was before industrialisation. Rice, noodles and other mixed hot foods are often eaten, either at a restaurant or brought in a container. Western cuisine is not uncommon. It is called ÂçàÈ§ê or ÂçàÈ•≠ in most areas. =Europe= A lunch on the Danish island of Bornholm An arroz de marisco (shellfish-rice) lunch dish in Portugal Farmworkers taking a lunch break at Nieuw-Scheemda, Oldambt, Groningen, Netherlands, A lunch menu at a restaurant in Riga, Latvia. Lunch in Denmark, referred to as frokost, is a light meal. Often it includes rye bread with different toppings such as liver p√¢t√©, herring, and cheese. Sm√∏rrebr√∏d is a Danish lunch delicacy that is often used for business meetings or special events. In Finland, lunch is a full hot meal, served as one course, sometimes with small salads and desserts. Dishes are diverse, ranging from meat or fish courses to soups that are heavy enough to constitute a meal. In France, the midday meal is taken between noon and 2:00pm. In Italy, lunch is taken around 12:30 in the north, and at 2:00 pm in the center south; it's a full meal, but is lighter than supper. In Germany, lunch was traditionally the main meal of the day. It is traditionally a substantial hot meal, sometimes with additional courses like soup and dessert. It is usually a savoury dish, consisting of protein (e.g., meat), starchy foods (e.g., potatoes), and vegetables or salad. Casseroles and stews are popular as well. There are a few sweet dishes like Germkn√∂del or rice pudding that can serve as a main course, too. Lunch is called Mittagessenliterally, \\"midday's food\\". In the Netherlands, Belgium, and Norway, it is common to eat sandwiches for lunch: slices of bread that people usually carry to work or school and eat in the canteen. The slices of bread are usually filled with sweet or savoury foodstuffs such as chocolate sprinkles (hagelslag), apple syrup, peanut butter, slices of meat, cheese or kroket. The meal typically includes coffee, milk or juice, and sometimes yogurt, some fruit or soup. It is eaten around noon, during a lunch break. In Portugal, lunch (almo√ßo in Portuguese) consists of a full hot meal, similar to dinner, normally with soup, meat or fish course, and dessert. It is served between noon and 2:00pm. It is the main meal of the day throughout the country. The Portuguese word lanches derives from the English word \\"lunch\\", but it refers to a lighter meal or snack taken during the afternoon (around 5pm) due to the fact that, traditionally, Portuguese dinner is served at a later hour than in English-speaking countries. In Spain, the midday meal, \\"lunch\\" takes place between 1:00pm and 3:00pm and is effectively dinner, (the main meal of the day); in contrast, supper does not usually begin until between 8:30pm and 10:00pm. Being the main meal of the day everywhere, it usually consists of a three-course meal: the first course usually consists of an appetizer; the main course of a more elaborate dish, usually meat- or fish- based; the dessert of something sweet, often accompanied by a coffee or small amounts of spirits. Most places of work have a complete restaurant with a lunch break of a least an hour. Spanish schools have a complete restaurant as well, and students have a one-hour break. Three courses are common practice at home, workplace, and schools. Most small shops close for between two and four hoursusually between 1:30pm to 4:30pmto allow to go home for a full lunch. In Sweden, lunch is usually a full hot meal, much as in Finland. In the United Kingdom, except on Sundays, lunch is often a small meal, designed to stave off hunger until returning home from work and eating dinner. It is usually eaten early in the afternoon. Lunch is often purveyed and consumed in pubs. Pub lunch dishes include fish and chips, ploughman's lunch and others. But on Sundays it is usually the main meal, and typically the largest and most formal meal of the week, to which family or other guests may be invited. It traditionally centres on a Sunday roast joint of meat. It may be served rather later than a weekday lunch, or not. Central Europe In Hungary, lunch is traditionally the main meal of the day, following a leves (soup). In Poland, the main meal of the day (called obiad) is traditionally eaten between 1:00pm and 5:00pm, and consists of a soup and a main dish. Most Poles equate the English word \\"lunch\\" with \\"obiad\\" because it is the second of the three main meals of the day; ≈õniadanie (breakfast), obiad (lunch/dinner) and kolacja (dinner/supper). There is another meal eaten by some called drugie ≈õniadanie, which means \\"second breakfast\\". Drugie ≈õniadanie is eaten around 10:00am and is a light snack, usually consisting of sandwiches, salad or a thin soup. Eastern Europe In Russia, the midday meal is taken in the afternoon. Usually, lunch is the biggest meal and consists of a first course, usually a soup, and a second course which would be meat and a garnish. Tea is standard. Southeastern Europe In Bosnia and Herzegovina, lunch is the main meal of the day. It is traditionally a substantial hot meal, sometimes with additional courses like soup and dessert. It is usually a savoury dish, consisting of protein (such as meat), starchy foods (such as potatoes), and a vegetable or salad. It is usually eaten around 2:00pm. In Romania, lunch (pr√¢nz in Romanian) is the main hot meal of the day. It is usually eaten at 12:00pm, but never later than 3:00pm. Lunch normally consists of two dishes: usually, the first course is a light soup and the second course, the main course, often consists of meat accompanied by potato, rice or pasta (garniturƒÉ) Traditionally, people used to bake and eat desserts, but nowadays it is less common. On Sundays, the lunch is more consistent and is usually accompanied by an appetiser or salad. =West Asia (Middle East)= port workers aboard a cargo ship during their common lunch, 1958 In West Asia (Middle East) and in most Arab countries, lunch is eaten between 1:00pm and 4:00pm and is the main meal of the day. It usually consists of meat, rice, vegetables and sauces and is sometimes but not always followed by dessert. Lunch is also eaten as a light meal at times in the Middle East, such as when children arrive at home from school while the parents are still out working. Water is commonly served, which may be iced, and other beverages such as soft drinks or yogurt drinks are also consumed. =North America= In the United States and Canada, lunch is usually a moderately sized meal generally eaten around noontime. During the work week, North Americans generally eat a quick lunch that often includes some type of sandwich, soup, or leftovers from the previous night's dinner (e.g., rice or pasta). Children often bring packed lunches to school, which might consist of a sandwich such as bologna (or other cold cut) and cheese, tuna, chicken, or peanut butter and jelly, as well as in Canada, savoury pie, as well as some fruit, chips, dessert and a drink such as juice, milk, or water. They may also buy meals as provided by their school. Adults may leave work to go out for a quick lunch, which might include some type of hot or cold sandwich such as a hamburger or \\"sub\\" sandwich. Salads and soups are also common, as well as a soup and sandwich, tacos, burritos, sushi, bento boxes, and pizza. Lunch may be consumed at various types of restaurants, such as formal, fast casual and fast food restaurants. Canadians and Americans generally do not go home for lunch, and lunch rarely lasts more than an hour except for business lunches, which may last longer. In the United States the three-martini lunchso called because the meal extends to the amount of time it takes to drink three martinishas been making a comeback since 2010. Businesses can deduct 80% of the cost of these lunches. Children generally are given a break in the middle of the school day to eat lunch. Public schools often have a cafeteria where children can buy lunch or eat a packed lunch. Boarding schools and private schools, including universities, often have a cafeteria where lunch is served. In Mexico, lunch (almuerzo) is usually the main meal of the day and normally takes place between 2:00pm and 4:00pm. It usually includes three or four courses: the first is an entr√©e of rice, noodles or pasta, but also may include a soup or salad. The second consists of a main dish, called a guisado, served with one or two side dishes such as refried beans, cooked vegetables, rice or salad. The main dish is accompanied by tortillas or a bread called bolillo. The third course is a combination of a traditional dessert or sweet, caf√© de olla, and a digestif. During the meal, it is usual to drink aguas frescas, although soft drinks have gained ground in recent years. =Oceania= In Australia, a light meal eaten in the period between 10:30am and noon is considered brunch; an actual lunch will be eaten between 12 and 2PM. While usually consisting of fruit or a cereal product, a typical Australian brunch may include other foods as well such as burgers, sandwiches, other light food items, and hot dishes. Sometimes a meal during the late afternoon is referred to as \\"afternoon tea\\", a meal in which food portions are usually significantly smaller than at lunch, sometimes consisting of nothing more than coffee or other beverages. =South America= In Argentina, lunch is usually the main meal of the day, and normally takes place between noon and 2:00 p.m. People usually eat a wide variety of foods, such as chicken, beef, pasta, salads, and a drink like water, soda or wine, and some dessert. Although at work, people usually take a fast meal which can consist of a sandwich brought from home or bought as fast food. In Brazil, lunch is the main meal of the day, taking place between 11:30 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. Brazilians basically eat rice with beans, salad, french fries, some kind of meat or pasta dishes. But the kind of food may vary from region to region. Lunch breaks and working lunches Since lunch typically falls in the early- middle of the working day, it can either be eaten on a break from work, or as part of the workday. The difference between those who work through lunch and those who take it off could be a matter of cultural, social class, bargaining power, or the nature of the work. Also, to simplify matters, some cultures refer to meal breaks at work as \\"lunch\\" no matter when they occureven in the middle of the night. This is especially true for jobs that have employees that rotate shifts.

La Fontaine's grandfather, Peter LaFontaine, was a French trader from Fort Detroit who came to Kekionga in 1776. He arrived with Charles Beaubien, and both men married Miami women and declared their loyalty to the Miami.Poinsatte, 14 In 1828, at age 18, La Fontaine became the chief of his Miami village.Federal Writers' Project, 315 The same year, he married Catherine, the daughter of Chief Jean Baptiste Richardville., Historic Forks of the Wabash.

This historic marker is on Indiana State Road 5 Chief Richardville died in 1841, and Chief La Fontaine became the new principal chief of the Miami. He moved his family into Richardville's house at The Forks Of The Wabash, which doubled as the tribal headquarters. In 1846, the Miami nation was forcibly split. Although the terms of the treaty allowed La Fontaine to stay in Indiana with the Eastern tribe, he first travelled with the Western tribe to Kansas. On his return trip, he died in Lafayette, Indiana. Speculation exists that he may have been poisoned by a member of the Western Miami tribe who viewed La Fontaine with suspicion.Federal Writers' Project, 198 La Fontaine's body was returned to the Forks of the Wabash, and his remains lie in Mt. Calvary Cemetery near Huntington, Indiana.Allison, 293 Catherine La Fontaine died two years later. Francis and Catherine had seven children: Esther (married John Zahn), Frances (married George Gawn), Archangel (married Chris Engleman), Louis, John, Joe, and Tom. The youngest of the children were placed in the care of the Roman Catholic Church, and the sons were educated at the University of Notre Dame as payment for a mortgage Francis had granted the school to keep it financially stable.

Early life and education Thomas grew up in Richmond, Virginia, and dropped out of high school before enlisting in the army during World War II. After the war he moved to Washington, D.C., where he held a series of federal government jobs beginning with janitor and ending in the Department of the Interior's Office of Public Affairs. He worked a second full-time job as headwaiter at Bolling Air Force Base so that his children would be able to attend college. Career In 1986, after retiring from Interior, Thomas challenged incumbent William Spaulding for the Ward 5 council seat in the Democratic primary and won. During his tenure in office he was known as a ward boss more focused on providing constituent services than sponsoring legislation. He received attention for sponsoring controversial ceremonial resolutions honoring Louis Farrakhan and Abdul Alim Muhammad, two leaders of the Nation of Islam. In 1998, Thomas ran for re-election, challenged by Vincent Orange, who had run against him in 1994, and three other others. The Washington Post's editorial board endorsed Orange's candidacy.

Backmasking is a recording technique in which a sound or message is recorded backward onto a track that is meant to be played forward. Backmasking is a deliberate process, whereas a message found through phonetic reversal may be unintentional. Backmasking was popularised by the Beatles, who used backward instrumentation on their 1966 album Revolver. Artists have since used backmasking for artistic, comedic and satiric effect, on both analogue and digital recordings. The technique has also been used to censor words or phrases for \\"clean\\" releases of explicit songs. In 1969, rumors of a backmasked message in the Beatles song \\"Revolution 9\\" sparked the Paul is dead urban legend. In the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, Christian groups in the United States alleged that backmasking was being used by prominent rock musicians for Satanic purposes, leading to record-burning protests and proposed anti-backmasking legislation by state and federal governments.Billiter, Bill (April 28, 1982). \\"Satanic Messages Played Back for Assembly Panel\\". Los Angeles Times, page B3. Many popular musicians have since been accused of including backmasked messages in their music. However, apparent backmasked messages may in fact be examples of pareidolia ‚Äì the brain's tendency to recognize patterns in meaningless data ‚Äì or coincidental phonetic reversal. History=Development= In 1877, Thomas Edison invented the phonograph, a device allowing sound to be recorded and reproduced on a rotating cylinder with a stylus (or \\"needle\\") attached to a diaphragm mounted at the narrow end of a horn. Emile Berliner invented the familiar lateral-cut disc phonograph record in 1888. In addition to recreating recorded sounds by placing the stylus on the cylinder or disc and rotating it in the same direction as during the recording, one could hear different sounds by rotating the cylinder or disc backwards. In 1878, Edison noted that, when played backwards, \\"the song is still melodious in many cases, and some of the strains are sweet and novel, but altogether different from the song reproduced in the right way\\". The backwards playing of records was advised as training for magicians by occultist Aleister Crowley, who suggested in his 1913 book Magick (Book 4) that an adept \\"train himself to think backwards by external means\\", one of which was to \\"listen to phonograph records, reversed\\". In the movie Gold Diggers of 1935, the end of the dancing pianos musical number \\"The Words Are in My Heart\\" is filmed in reverse motion with the accompanying instrumental score incidentally being reversed. Tape recorders allow backward recording in recording studios The 1950s saw two new developments in audio technology: the development of musique concr√®te, an avant-garde form of electronic music, which involves editing together fragments of natural and industrial sounds; and the concurrent spread of the use of tape recorders in recording studios. These two trends led to tape music compositions, composed on tape using techniques including reverse tape effects. In 1959, a vocal group called The Eligibles released a record called \\"Car Trouble\\", which contains two nonsense passages. When reversed, they reveal the phrases \\"And you can get my daughter back by 10:30, you bum!\\" and (perhaps inevitably) \\"Now, lookit here, cats, stop running these records backwards!\\". Peaking at #107 on the Billboard magazine charts that summer, \\"Car Trouble\\" is believed to be the first hit record to contain backmasking.\\"Car Trouble\\" on YouTube The Beatles, who incorporated the techniques of concr√®te into their recordings, were responsible for popularizing the concept of backmasking. Singer John Lennon and producer George Martin both claimed they discovered the backward recording technique during the recording of 1966's Revolver; specifically the album tracks \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" and \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\", and the single \\"Rain\\". Lennon stated that, while under the influence of marijuana, he accidentally played the tapes for \\"Rain\\" in reverse and enjoyed the sound. The following day he shared the results with the other Beatles, and the effect was used first in the guitar solo for \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" and later in the coda of \\"Rain\\". According to Martin, the band had been experimenting with changing the speeds of and reversing the \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" tapes, and Martin got the idea of reversing Lennon's vocals and guitar, which he did with a clip from \\"Rain\\". Lennon then liked the effect and kept it. Regardless, \\"Rain\\" was the first Beatles song to feature a backmasked message: \\"Sunshine ... Rain ... When the rain comes, they run and hide their heads\\" (; the last line is the reversed first verse of the song). =Controversies= The Beatles were involved in the spread of backmasking both as a recording technique and as the center of a controversy. The latter has its roots in an event in 1969, when WKNR-FM DJ Russ Gibb received a phone call from a student at Eastern Michigan University who identified himself as \\"Tom\\". The caller asked Gibb about a rumor that Beatle Paul McCartney had died, and claimed that the Beatles song \\"Revolution 9\\" contained a backward message confirming the rumor. Gibb played the song backwards on his turntable, and heard \\"Turn me on, dead man ... turn me on, dead man ... turn me on, dead man ...\\". Gibb began telling his listeners about what he called \\"The Great Cover-up\\", and to the original clue were added various others, including the alleged backmasked message \\"Paul is a dead man, miss him, miss him, miss him\\", in \\"I'm So Tired\\". The \\"Paul is dead\\" rumor popularized the idea of backmasking in popular music. After Gibb's show, many more songs were found to contain phrases that sounded like known spoken languages when reversed. Initially, the search was done mostly by fans of rock music; but, in the late 1970s, during the rise of the Christian right in the United States, fundamentalist Christian groups began to claim that backmasked messages could bypass the conscious mind and reach the unconscious mind, where they would be unknowingly accepted by the listener. In 1981, Christian DJ Michael Mills began stating on Christian radio programs that Led Zeppelin's \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" contained hidden Satanic messages that were heard by the unconscious. In early 1982, the Trinity Broadcasting Network's Paul Crouch hosted a show with self-described neuroscientist William Yarroll, who argued that rock stars were cooperating with the Church of Satan to place hidden subliminal messages on records. Also in 1982, fundamentalist Christian pastor Gary Greenwald held public lectures on dangers of backmasking, along with at least one mass record-smashing. During the same year, thirty North Carolina teenagers, led by their pastor, claimed that singers had been possessed by Satan, who used their voices to create backward messages, and held a record- burning at their church. Allegations of demonic backmasking were also made by social psychologists, parents and critics of rock music, as well as the Parents Music Resource Center (formed in 1985), which accused Led Zeppelin of using backmasking to promote Satanism. =Legislation= One result of the furor was the firing of five radio DJs who had encouraged listeners to search for backward messages in their record collections. A more serious consequence was legislation by the state governments of Arkansas and California. The 1983 California bill was introduced to prevent backmasking that \\"can manipulate our behavior without our knowledge or consent and turn us into disciples of the Antichrist\\". Involved in the discussion on the bill was a California State Assembly Consumer Protection and Toxic Materials Committee hearing, during which \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" was played backwards, and William Yaroll testified. The successful bill made the distribution of records with undeclared backmasking an invasion of privacy for which the distributor could be sued. The Arkansas law passed unanimously in 1983, referenced albums by the Beatles, Pink Floyd, Electric Light Orchestra, Queen and Styx, and mandated that records with backmasking include a warning sticker: \\"Warning: This record contains backward masking which may be perceptible at a subliminal level when the record is played forward.\\" However, the bill was returned to the state senate by Governor Bill Clinton and defeated. House Resolution 6363, introduced in 1982 by Representative Bob Dornan (R-California), proposed mandating a similar label; the bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Commerce, Transportation and Tourism and was never passed. from THOMAS Government action was also called for in the legislatures of Texas and Canada. The compact disc made finding backward messages difficult, causing interest in backmasking to decline. With the advent of compact discs in the 1980s, but prior to the advent of sound editing technology for personal computers in the 1990s, it became more difficult to listen to recordings backwards, and the controversy died down. =Resurgence= Although the backmasking controversy peaked in the 1980s, the general belief in subliminal manipulation became more widespread in the United States during the following decade, with belief in Satanic backmasking on records persisting into the 1990s. At the same time, the development of sound editing software with audio reversal features simplified the process of reversing audio, which previously could only be done with full fidelity using a professional tape recorder. The Sound Recorder utility, included with Microsoft Windows from Windows 95 to Windows XP, allows one-click audio reversal, as does popular open source sound editing software Audacity. Following the growth of the Internet, backmasked message searchers used such software to create websites featuring backward music samples, which became a widely used method of exploring backmasking in popular music. In January 2014, the first backmasked video was released as part of a Grammy Awards promotional campaign. A customized video player allowed the user to watch a piece of film accompanied by a music soundtrack both forwards and backwards. The backwards content contained a hidden visual story and the words 'music unleashes you' embedded into the reversed audio track. Use The switch to digital audio made recording backmasked messages quicker and easier. Backmasking has been used as a recording technique since the 1960s. In the era of magnetic tape sound recording, backmasking required that the source reel- to-reel tape actually be played backwards, which was achieved by first being wound onto the original takeup reel, then reversing the reels so as to use that reel as the source (this would reverse the stereo channels as well). Digital audio recording has greatly simplified the process. Backmasked words are unintelligible noise when played forward, but when played backwards are clear speech. Listening to backmasked audio with most turntables requires disengaging the drive and rotating the album by hand in reverse (though some can play records backwards). With magnetic tape, the tape must be reversed and spliced back into the cassette. Compact discs were difficult to reverse when first introduced, but digital audio editors, which were first introduced in the late 1980s and became popular during the next decade, allow easy reversal of audio from digital sources. =Satanic backmasking= In the 1973 film The Exorcist, a tape of noises from the possessed victim was discovered to contain a message when the tape was played backwards. This scene might have inspired subsequent copycat musical effects. Although the Satanic backmasking controversy involved mainly classic rock songs, whose authors denied any intent to promote Satanism, backmasking has been used by heavy metal bands to deliberately insert messages in their lyrics or imagery. Bands have utilized Satanic imagery for commercial reasons. For example, thrash metal band Slayer included at the start of the band's 1985 album Hell Awaits a deep backmasked voice repeatedly chanting \\"join us\\". However, Slayer vocalist Tom Araya states that the band's use of Satanic imagery was \\"solely for effect\\". Cradle of Filth, another band that has employed Satanic imagery, released a song entitled \\"Dinner at Deviant's Palace\\", consisting almost entirely of unusual sounds and a reversed reading of the Lord's Prayer (a backwards reading of the Lord's Prayer is reportedly a major part of the Black Mass). Seattle-based grunge band Soundgarden parodied the phenomenon of Satanic backmasking on their 1989 album Ultramega OK. When played backwards, the songs \\"665\\" and \\"667\\" reveal a song about Santa Claus. Marilyn Manson has frequently used this technique. For example, in the beginning of his song \\"Tourniquet\\" when played backwards, his voice is heard saying \\"This is my lowest point of vulnerability\\" as explained in his book The Long Hard Road Out of Hell. =Aesthetic use= Backmasking is often used for aesthetics, i.e., to enhance the meaning or sound of a track. During the Judas Priest subliminal message trial, lead singer Rob Halford admitted to recording the words \\"In the dead of the night, love bites\\" backwards into the track \\"Love Bites\\", from the 1984 album Defenders of the Faith. Asked why he recorded the message, Halford stated that \\"When you're composing songs, you're always looking for new ideas, new sounds.\\" Stanley Kubrick used \\"Masked Ball\\", an adaptation by Jocelyn Pook of her earlier work \\"Backwards Priests\\" (from the album Flood) featuring reversed Romanian chanting, as the background music for the masquerade ball scene in Eyes Wide Shut. At the end of \\"Before I Forget\\" by Slipknot, lead singer Corey Taylor's voice can be heard saying \\"... You're wasting it\\" which is in reference to how Rick Rubin, the producer of their album Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses, wanted Taylor to change the chorus vocal melody because he felt it wasn't catchy; however, Taylor stood his ground and the chorus stayed unchanged.\\"Corey Taylor Interview at 98 KUPD\\". YouTube. 2009-03-05. Retrieved 2011-12-19. One backmasking technique is to reverse an earlier part of a song. Missy Elliott used this technique in one of her songs, \\"Work It\\", as did Jay Chou (\\"You Can Hear\\", from Ye Hui Mei), At the Drive-In (\\"300 MHz\\", from Vaya), and Lacuna Coil (\\"Self Deception\\", from Comalies). A related technique is to reverse an entire instrumental track. John Lennon originally wanted to do so with \\"Rain\\", but objections by producer George Martin and bandmate Paul McCartney cut the backward section to 30 seconds. The Stone Roses have made heavy use of this technique in songs including \\"Don't Stop\\", \\"Guernica\\", and \\"Simone\\", which are all backwards versions of other Stone Roses tracks, sometimes overdubbed with new vocals that sound somewhat similar to the initial track when backmasked. Meanwhile, Klaatu used the reversed vocals from \\"Anus of Uranus\\" (from their first album, 3:47 EST) as the vocals for the song \\"Silly Boys\\" (on their third album, Sir Army Suit). The lyrics for \\"Silly Boys\\" on the lyric sheet from Sir Army Suit are accordingly printed backwards. Danish band Mew's 2009 album No More Stories... contains a track, \\"New Terrain\\", which, when listened to in reverse, reveals a new song, entitled \\"Nervous\\". Soul duo Gnarls Barkley released a companion version of their album The Odd Couple, an instrumental album called elpuoc ddo eht, consisting of the original album, fused into a single 38:44-long track, and reversed. This album can be legally obtained by owners of the original, as it is meant to complement it, and be a resource to samplers. Artists often use backmasking of sounds or instrumental audio to produce interesting sound effects. One such sound effect is the reverse echo. When done on tape, such use of backmasking is known as reverse tape effects. One example is Matthew Sweet's 1999 album In Reverse, which includes reversed guitar parts which were played directly onto a tape running in reverse. For live concerts, the guitar parts were played live on stage using a backward emulator. =Humorous and parody messages= The manual for the popular sound program SoX advised that the \\"reverse\\" option could be used \\"for finding Satanic subliminals\\" A common use of backmasking is hiding a comedic or parodical message backwards in a song. The B-side of the 1966 Napoleon XIV single \\"They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!\\" is a reversed version of the entire forwards record, titled \\"!aaaH-aH ,yawA eM ekaT oT gnimoC er'yehT\\". The forward version reached #3 in the US charts and #4 in the UK. WWE wrestler Al Snow had a theme song that had backmasking in it. The song was mostly instrumental, but at one point a clearly audible voice can be heard saying a line of gibberish. When the song is played backward, the gibberish is actually saying \\"I AM THE ONE IN CONTROL\\". The message played on Al Snow's character as an unstable mad man. Oingo Boingo has a Christian message promoting salvation through Christ backmasked into one of their songs, Cry of the Vatos. Although the song appears to be gibberish and animal noises when played forwards, when reversed, Danny Elfman can be heard saying, \\"Just once or twice is good for your soul/Praise God brothers and sisters/Accept Jesus Christ in your heart and you will be saved/You will receive everlasting life/Listen to me, I sinned, I know.\\" The first line is reference to the lyrics from the title track of the album. They did this as a way to satirize the widespread fear of Satanic messages, especially since Oingo Boingo, while never described as or accused of being Satanist, introduced topics like madness, impiety, and blatant absurdity into their songs more often than not. The Beatles song \\"Free as a Bird\\" was originally composed and recorded in 1977 as a home demo by John Lennon. In 1995 a studio version of the recording, incorporating contributions from Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, was released as a new single from The Beatles Anthology 1 project, 25 years after their break-up and 15 years after Lennon's death. In a humorous self-parody and tribute to Lennon, the surviving Beatles inserted a backmasked clip of Lennon saying \\"Turned out nice again\\" at the very end of the song. Pink Floyd dropped a backmasked message into \\"Empty Spaces\\": * ... Congratulations. You have just discovered the secret message. Please send your answer to Old Pink, care of the Funny Farm, Chalfont ... * Roger! Carolyne's on the phone! * Okay. The first line may refer to former lead singer Syd Barrett, who is thought to have suffered a nervous breakdown years earlier. In \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic's \\"Nature Trail to Hell\\", from 1984's \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic in 3-D, Yankovic's backmasked voice declares that \\"Satan eats Cheez Whiz\\". Another early example can be found on the J. Geils Band track \\"No Anchovies, Please\\", from 1980s album Love Stinks. The message, disguised as a foreign- sounding language spoken under the narration, is, \\"It doesn't take a genius to tell the difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.\\" Belgian act Po√©sie Noire included a satirical backmasked message on their 1988 album Tetra saying \\"You fucking asshole, play the record in the normal way\\". Tenacious D includes the backmasked message \\"Eat Donkey Crap\\" at the end of \\"Karate\\" from their self-titled first album. Styx, after being accused of Satanic backmasking, included an actual backmasked message in Kilroy Was Here: \\"Annuit c≈ìptis, Novus ordo seclorum\\". Electric Light Orchestra and Styx, following their involvement in the 1980s backmasking controversy, released songs that parody the allegations made against them. ELO, after being accused of Satanic backmasking on their 1974 album Eldorado, included backmasked messages in two songs on their next album, 1975's Face the Music. \\"Down Home Town\\" begins with a voice twice repeating (in reverse) \\"Face the mighty waterfall\\". And the opening instrumental \\"Fire On High\\" contains the backmasked message \\"The music is reversible, but time is not. Turn back! Turn back! Turn back! Turn back!\\" (). In 1983, ELO released an entire album, Secret Messages, in response to the controversy. Among the many backmasked messages on the album are: \\"Welcome to the big show\\" (2x); \\"Thank you for listening\\"; \\"Look out there's danger ahead\\"; \\"Hup two three four\\"; \\"Time After Time\\"; and \\"You're playing me backwards\\". Styx also released an album in response to allegations of Satanic backmasking: 1983's Kilroy Was Here, which deals with an allegorical group called the \\"Majority for Musical Morality\\" that outlaws rock music. A sticker on the album cover contains the message, \\"By order of the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward messages\\", and the song \\"Heavy Metal Poisoning\\" does in fact contain the backmasked Latin words \\"Annuit c≈ìptis, Novus ordo seclorum\\" (\\"[God] has favored our undertakings; a new order for the ages\\")‚Äîpart of the Great Seal which encircles the pyramid on the back of the American dollar bill. Iron Maiden's 1983 album Piece of Mind features a short backwards message, included by the band in response to allegations of Satanism that were surrounding them at the time. Between the songs \\"The Trooper\\" and \\"Still Life\\" is inebriated drummer Nicko McBrain doing an impression of Idi Amin Dada: \\"'What ho', sed de t'ing wid de t'ree bonce [said the thing with the three heads]. Don't meddle wid t'ings you don't understand,\\" followed by a belch. Prince's controversial song \\"Darling Nikki\\" includes the backmasked message, \\"Hello, how are you? I am fine, because I know that the Lord is coming soon.\\" The Waitresses' 1982 EP I Could Rule the World if I Could Only Get the Parts included a backwards masking warning on the cover and a message masked within the song \\"The Smartest Person I Know\\": \\"Anyone who believes in backwards masking is a fool.\\" Some messages chastise or poke fun at the listener who is playing the song backwards. One such message was included by \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic in \\"I Remember Larry\\", from the 1996 album Bad Hair Day, on which Yankovic lightly chastises the listener with the backmasked remark, \\"Wow, [you] must have an awful lot of free time on your hands\\". Similarly, the B-52's song \\"Detour Through Your Mind\\", from the 1986 LP Bouncing off the Satellites, contains the message, \\"I buried my parakeet in the backyard. Oh no, you're playing the record backwards. Watch out, you might ruin your needle.\\" A similar message comes from the Canadian band Frozen Ghost from their 1987 self-titled debut album: \\"You are ruining your needle!\\" Meanwhile, Christian rock group Petra included in their song \\"Judas' Kiss\\", from the 1982 album More Power to Ya, the message, \\"What are you looking for the devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?\\" Bloodhound Gang's 1996 controversy-begging track \\"Lift Your Head Up High (And Blow Your Brains Out)\\" mocked the Judas Priest controversy directly, and included the backmasked phrase \\"Devil child, wake up and eat Chef Boyardee Beefaroni\\". The band Mindless Self Indulgence released a song titled \\"Backmaskwarning!\\", which contains the forward lyrics \\"Play that record backwards / Here's a message yo for the suckas / Play that record backwards / And go fuck yourself\\". The backwards messages in the song include, \\"clean your room\\", \\"do your homework\\", \\"don't stay out too late\\", and \\"eat your vegetables\\". Devo's hit song \\"Whip It\\" has Mark Mothersbaugh saying \\"Hey come over here!\\" when the song is played backwards. Backmasking was also parodied in a 2001 episode of the television series The Simpsons titled \\"New Kids on the Blecch\\". Bart Simpson joins a boy band called the Party Posse, whose song \\"Drop da Bomb\\" includes the repeated lyric \\"Yvan eht nioj\\". Lisa Simpson becomes suspicious and plays the song backward, revealing the backmasked message \\"Join the Navy\\", which leads her to realize that the boy band was created as a subliminal recruiting tool for the United States Navy. The Futurama episode \\"Calculon 2.0\\" also has a scene where an installation disc is played backward on what looks like an old fashioned gramophone player, with the words \\"rise from the dead in the name of Satan\\" coming from it. =Critical or explicit messages= Frank Zappa used backmasking to avoid censorship. Backmasking has also been used to record statements perhaps too critical or explicit to be used forwards. Frank Zappa used backmasking to avoid censorship of the track \\"Hot Poop\\", from We're Only in It for the Money (1968). The released version contains at the end of its side \\"A\\" the backmasked message \\"Better look around before you say you don't care. / Shut your fucking mouth 'bout the length of my hair. / How would you survive / If you were alive / shitty little person?\\" This profanity-laced verse, originally from the song \\"Mother People\\", was censored by Verve Records, so Zappa edited the verse out, reversed it, and inserted it elsewhere in the album as \\"Hot Poop\\" (though even in the backward message the word \\"fucking\\" is censored). On the same album, a modified backmasking can be heard in \\"Harry, You're a Beast\\" with Madge saying, \\"Don't come in me, in me\\" repeatedly before she starts crying. In at least one bootleg version of the album, these words are very clear. Another example is found in Roger Waters' 1992 album Amused to Death, on which Waters recorded a backward message, possibly critical of film director Stanley Kubrick, who had refused to let Waters sample a breathing sound from 2001: A Space Odyssey. The message appears in the song \\"Perfect Sense Part 1\\", in which Waters' backmasked voice says, \\"Julia, however, in light and visions of the issues of Stanley, we have changed our minds. We have decided to include a backward message, Stanley, for you and all the other book burners.\\" =Censorship= A further use of backmasking is to censor words and phrases deemed inappropriate on radio edits and \\"clean\\" album releases. For example, the Fugees' clean version of the album The Score contains various backmasked profanities; thus, when playing the album backwards, the censored words are clearly audible among the backward gibberish. When used with the word \\"shit\\", this type of backmasking results in a sound similar to \\"ish\\". As a result, \\"ish\\" became a euphemism for \\"shit\\". Iron Maiden used a similar technique on the radio edit of their \\"Holy Smoke\\" single, in which there are two rare instances of profanity in their lyrics, which were reversed to give \\"Flies around tish/Bees around honey\\" and \\"I've lived in filth, I've lived in sin/And I still smell cleaner than the tish you're in\\". In Britney Spears' 2011 song \\"Till the World Ends\\", Spears says \\"if you want this good shit\\". However, on the official version, \\"shit\\" is reversed, creating the \\"ish\\" sound; therefore, the official version says \\"if you want this good ish\\". Backmasking is also used to censor the word \\"joint\\" in the video for \\"You Don't Know How It Feels\\" by Tom Petty, resulting in the line \\"Let's roll another tnioj\\". Accusations Artists who have been accused of backmasking include Led Zeppelin, the Beatles, Pink Floyd, Electric Light Orchestra, Queen, Styx, Judas Priest, the Eagles, the Rolling Stones, Jefferson Starship, AC/DC, Black Oak Arkansas, Rush, Britney Spears, and Eminem. Electric Light Orchestra was accused of hiding a backward Satanic message in their 1974 album Eldorado. The title track, \\"Eldorado\\", was said to contain the message \\"He is the nasty one / Christ, you're infernal / It is said we're dead men / Everyone who has the mark will live.\\" ELO singer and songwriter Jeff Lynne responded by calling this accusation (and the related charge of being \\"devil-worshippers\\") \\"skcollob\\", and stating that the message \\"is absolutely manufactured by whoever said, 'That's what it said.' It doesn't say anything of the sort.\\" The group included several backward messages in later albums in response to the accusations. In 1981, Styx was accused of putting the backward message \\"Satan move through our voices\\" on the song \\"Snowblind\\", from Paradise Theatre. Guitarist James Young called these charges \\"rubbish,\\" and responded, \\"If we want to make a statement, we'll do it in a way that people can understand us and not in a way where you have to go out and buy a $400 tape player to understand us.\\" The vinyl reproduction of Paradise Theater had laser etching on side one, spelling out Styx at the top, and two ladies facing each other on the sides. But on side two, the side with the song (Snow Blind) it had a black label with a small hole cut out where you could place the eraser side of a pencil, and play the album backwards to hear the backward message. In 1983, the band released a concept album, Kilroy Was Here, satirizing the Moral Majority. A well-known alleged message is found in rock group Led Zeppelin's 1971 song \\"Stairway to Heaven\\". The backwards playing of a portion of the song purportedly results in words beginning with \\"Here's to my sweet Satan\\" (). Swan Song Records issued a statement to the contrary: \\"Our turntables only play in one direction‚Äîforwards.\\" Led Zeppelin vocalist Robert Plant denied the accusations in an interview: \\"To me it's very sad, because 'Stairway to Heaven' was written with every best intention, and as far as reversing tapes and putting messages on the end, that's not my idea of making music.\\" Another widely known alleged message, \\"It's fun to smoke marijuana\\", in Queen's song \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\", is similarly disclaimed by the group's spokesperson. =Subliminal persuasion=Fundamentalist Christian groups Various fundamentalist Christian groups have declared that Satan‚Äîor Satan-influenced musicians‚Äîuse backmasked messages to subliminally alter behavior. Pastor Gary Greenwald claimed that subliminal messages backmasked into rock music induce listeners towards sex and drug use. Minister Jacob Aranza wrote in his 1982 book Backward Masking Unmasked that rock groups \\"are using backmasking to convey Satanic and drug related messages to the subconscious.\\" Christian DJ Michael Mills argued in 1981 that \\"the subconscious mind is being successfully affected by the repetition of beat and lyrics‚Äîbeing affected through a subliminal message.\\"Mills, Michael. Hidden and Satanic Messages In Rock Music. Radio interview, 1981, blog.wfmu.org. Introduction, at 1:22 Mills has toured America warning Christian parents about subliminal messages in rock music. Some Christian websites have claimed that backmasking is widely used for Satanic purposes. The web page for Alabama group Dial-the-Truth Ministries argues for the existence of Satanic backmasking in \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", saying that the song contains the backward message, \\"It's my sweet Satan ... Oh I will sing because I live with Satan.\\" PMRC In 1985, Joe Stuessy testified to the United States Congress at the Parents Music Resource Center hearings that: Stuessy's written testimony stated that: Court cases Serial killer Richard Ramirez, on trial in 1988, stated that AC/DC's music, and specifically the song \\"Night Prowler\\" on Highway to Hell, inspired him to commit murder. Reverse speech advocate David John Oates claimed that \\"Highway to Hell\\", on the same album, contains backmasked messages including \\"I'm the law\\", \\"my name is Lucifer\\", and \\"she belongs in hell\\". Originally published in Esotera magazine (June 1997). AC/DC's Angus Young responded that \\"you didn't need to play [the album] backwards, because we never hid [the messages]. We'd call an album Highway to Hell, there it was right in front of them.\\" In 1990, British heavy metal band Judas Priest was sued over a suicide pact made by two young men in Nevada. The lawsuit by their families claimed that the 1978 Judas Priest album Stained Class contained hidden messages, including the forward subliminal words \\"Do it\\" in the song \\"Better by You, Better than Me\\" (a cover version of a Spooky Tooth song), and various backward subliminal messages. The case was dismissed by the judge for insufficient evidence of Judas Priest's placement of subliminal messages on the record, and the judge's ruling stated that \\"The scientific research presented does not establish that subliminal stimuli, even if perceived, may precipitate conduct of this magnitude. There exist other factors which explain the conduct of the deceased independent of the subliminal stimuli.\\" Judas Priest members commented that if they wanted to insert subliminal commands in their music, messages leading to the deaths of their fans would be counterproductive, and they would prefer to insert the command \\"Buy more of our records.\\"Van Taylor, David. KNPB Channel 5 Public Broadcasting, 1982: Dream Deceivers: The Story Behind James Vance Vs. Judas Priest. =Skepticism= Skeptic Michael Shermer claims that the emergence of the \\"Paul is dead\\" phenomenon, including the alleged message at the end of \\"I'm So Tired\\", was caused by faulty perception of a pattern. Shermer argues that the human brain evolved with a strong pattern recognition ability that was necessary to process the large amount of noise in man's environment, but that today this ability leads to false positives. Stanford University psychology professor Brian Wandell postulates that the observance of backward messages is a mistake arising from this pattern recognition facility, and argues that subliminal persuasion theories are \\"bizarre\\" and \\"implausible.\\" Rumors of backmasking in popular music have been described as auditory pareidolia. James Walker, president of Christian research group Watchman Fellowship, states that \\"You could take a Christian hymn, and if you played it backwards long enough at different speeds, you could make that hymn say anything you want to\\"; Led Zeppelin publicist BP Fallon concurs, saying \\"Play anything backwards, and you'll find something.\\" Eric Borgos of audio reversal website talkbackwards.com states that \\"Mathematically, if you listen long enough, eventually you'll find a pattern\\", while Jeff Milner recounts, \\"Most people, when I show them the site, say that they're not able to hear anything, until, of course, I show them the reverse lyrics.\\" Audio engineer Evan Olcott claims that messages by artists including Queen and Led Zeppelin are coincidental phonetic reversals, in which the spoken or sung phonemes form new combinations of words when listened to backwards. Olcott states that \\"Actually engineering or planning a phonetic reversal is next to impossible, and even more difficult when trying to design it with words that fit into a song.\\" In 1985, University of Lethbridge psychologists John Vokey and J. Don Read conducted a study using Psalm 23 from the Bible, Queen's \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\", and other sound passages made up for the experiment. Vokey and Read concluded that if backmasking does exist, it is ineffective. Participants had trouble noticing backmasked phrases when the samples were played forwards, were unable to judge the types of messages (Christian, Satanic, or commercial), and were not led to behave in a certain way as a result of being exposed to the backmasked phrases. Vokey concluded that \\"we could find no effect of the meaning of engineered, backward messages on listeners' behaviour, either consciously or unconsciously.\\" Similar results to Vokey and Read's were obtained by D. Averill in 1982. Cited in A 1988 experiment by T.E. Moore found \\"no evidence that listeners were influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by the content of the backward messages.\\" In 1992, an experiment found that exposure to backward messages did not lead to significant changes in attitude. Psychology professor Mark D. Allen says that \\"delivering subliminal messages via backward masking is totally and ridiculously impossible\\". The finding of backward Satanic messages has been explained as caused by the observer-expectancy effect. The Skeptic's Dictionary states that \\"you probably won't hear [backmasked] messages until somebody first points them out to you. Perception is influenced by expectation and expectation is affected by what others prime you for.\\" In 1984, S. B. Thorne and P. Himelstein found that \\"when vague and unfamiliar stimuli are presented, [test subjects] are highly likely to accept suggestions, particularly when the suggestions are presented by someone with prestige and authority.\\" Cited in Vokey and Read concluded from their 1985 experiment that \\"the apparent presence of backward messages in popular music is a function more of active construction on the part of the perceiver than of the existence of the messages themselves.\\" See also * List of backmasked messages * Phonetic reversal * Programming the Nation? * Reverse speech * Subliminal stimuli References=NotesBibliography=  Chapter also available with commentary by Malinda McCall.

Owned by Entercom, it broadcasts an Alternative rock format, branding itself as The World Famous KROQ. The station has studios at the intersection of Venice Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue in the Crestview neighborhood in West Los Angeles. The transmitter is based in the Verdugo Mountains. It was the flagship station of Kevin and Bean (revamped as \\"Kevin in the Mornings With Allie & Jensen\\" in 2019) and former show Loveline, hosted originally by Jim \\"The Poorman\\" Trenton with Dr. Drew Pinsky, then by \\"Psycho\\" Mike Catherwood with Pinsky. The station's main competitor is iHeartMedia's KYSR. History=KPPC= KPPC logo used during the freeform period On April 23, 1962, KPPC-FM signed on the air. It was owned by the Pasadena Presbyterian Church as a companion to its KPPC, a limited-hours AM radio station that had broadcast since 1924. In 1967, the Pasadena Presbyterian Church sold KPPC-AM-FM to Crosby-Avery Broadcasting for $310,000. The church had been attempting to sell the radio stations for a year; station manager Edgar Pierce said the church found commercial radio incompatible with the noncommercial nature of its other efforts. Crosby-Avery was owned by Leon Crosby, a general manager of San Francisco's KMPX, a station that had just gone to a full-time freeform progressive rock format, and Lewis Avery, former partner in a national ad sales firm. With KMPX soaring to success but KPPC, with its middle-of-the-road format, ailing, Crosby and Avery brought in the architects of KMPX, Tom and Raechel Donahue, to turn around their new station in Southern California. Hosts included B. Mitchel Reed, Tom Donahue, novelty music historian Dr. Demento, Charles Laquidara, Elliot Mintz, blues archivist Johnny Otis and more. In 1969, Crosby sold KPPC-AM-FM and KMPX to the National Science Network for $1.2 million. Crosby used the funds to buy a then-silent San Francisco television station, KEMO-TV. National Science Network's management of the KPPC stations was turbulent, capped by an October 1971 mass firing of the air staff, but the period also included technical upgrades. NSN moved the studios out of the church basement and to 99 Chester Street in Pasadena and the transmitter to Flint Peak, with a slight power increase to 25,700 watts.FCC History Cards for KROQ-FM In 1971, Ludwig Wolfgang Frohlich, founder of the National Science Network and previous owner of an ad agency, died.http://www.wncn.org/Ownership___Management.html On his death, control of the estate was transferred to Ingrid and Thomas Burns. =KROQ AM and KROQ-FM=Beginnings and brief closing (1972‚Äì1974) Country music station KBBQ (1500 AM) in Burbank became KROQ in September 1972, changing its format to Top-40 and hiring established disc jockeys from other stations. The new KROQ called itself the \\"ROQ of Los Angeles\\". In 1973, with National Science Network's estate selling off its assets, KROQ's owners bought KPPC-AM-FM (immediately divesting the AM station to meet then-current ownership limits), changed the calls to KROQ-FM and hired Shadoe Stevens to create a new rock format described as high-energy \\"all-cutting-edge-rock-all- the-time\\" and began simulcasting as \\"The ROQs of L.A.: Mother Rock!\\" Meanwhile, KPPC on 1240 AM was sold to Universal Broadcasting, a religious broadcaster, and remained on the air with its limited-schedule of Wednesday evening and Sunday operation until subsequent owners took the station off the air permanently in 1996. The two stations were wildly successful initially with the new format, but poor money management plagued the enterprise. When concert promoter Ken Roberts (1941‚Äì2014) booked Sly and the Family Stone for one KROQ-sponsored show at the Los Angeles Coliseum and the station found itself unable to cover expenses, Roberts agreed to pay for the band to play the show in exchange for a small ownership stake in the station.Elaine Woo, \\"Ken Roberts Dies at 73; Promoter Transformed KROQ-FM into a Powerhouse,\\" Los Angeles Times, July 4, 2014. Roberts joined a sprawling ownership group which included a doctor, two dairymen, a political lobbyist, a secretary, and several other minor investors. Roberts with his background in the music industry made him a logical choice for president of the struggling company in the minds of the other shareholders, and he was elected such at the first meeting he attended in 1974. Unfortunately, by 1974 the station's finances were already untenable following a year of commercial-free programming ‚Äî a stunt implemented in an effort to gain market share. The stations' debt load reached $7 million; paychecks began to bounce and Shadoe Stevens and the bulk of the staff walked out, shutting the stations down. The closure would last for nearly two years. Rebirth and increasing popularity (1975‚Äì1989) In late 1975, the FCC ordered KROQ to return to the airwaves or surrender the stations' licenses. With barebones equipment, KROQ returned to the airwaves, broadcasting initially from the transmitter location, followed by a penthouse suite in the Pasadena Hilton Hotel, then across the street from the Hilton (117 S. Los Robles). Ken Roberts returned to the reborn station in a more forceful ownership role, buying out his partners one by one until he remained the sole owner of the station. KROQ's rebirth was simultaneous with the emergence of punk rock in the late 1970s and new wave, and KROQ quickly became the voice of the burgeoning Los Angeles punk and new wave scene. Disc jockey Rodney Bingenheimer introduced many new bands on his show. As punk expanded its hold on the music scene during the mid to late 1970s, and KROQ steadily adding more of it to their freeform format, this cemented their place in the Los Angeles market. In 1979, Shadoe Stevens once again left the station, with Rick Carroll taking over as program director, and took all of the new music and combined it in a Top 40 formatic structure. By 1980, the station had fully committed to a post-new wave modern rock orientation. KROQ became an even greater success as the \\"Rock of the 80s\\" evolved. During that decade, the station mixed punk rock, such as The Ramones, The Clash, The Pandoras and X, with New Wave, such as U2, Oingo Boingo, Talking Heads, The Police, The Cars, Devo, The Weirdos, Sparks, Fear, Berlin, Duran Duran, Pet Shop Boys, Blondie, Ska and similar genres with artists such as English Beat, Fine Young Cannibals and 60s underground rocker Iggy Pop, and huge mainstream artists such as The Beach Boys and The Rolling Stones. It was also not uncommon for certain KROQ dee-jays to play current hip-hop and soul/funk artists such as Arrested Development, Prince and Parliament Funkadelic. Carroll, as a consultant, took the \\"Rock of the 80s\\" format to other stations, including 91X in San Diego, KOEU in Palm Springs, California, KMGN FM in Bakersfield, California, The Quake in San Francisco and KYYX in Seattle, among a few on the US West Coast in the 1980s. In 1986, KROQ was purchased at a then-record $45 million by Infinity Broadcasting. By the late 1980s, the station had started dipping in the ratings. New wave had declined in popularity and electronic dance bands, such as Depeche Mode and New Order, started getting more airplay on the station. Also during this period, KROQ began focusing on college rock (or so- called alternative rock) by adding bands into their playlist such as R.E.M., the Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Psychedelic Furs, Echo & the Bunnymen, The Replacements, Camper Van Beethoven, Jane's Addiction, the Pixies, The Alarm, The Cult, Violent Femmes, Love and Rockets, Dramarama and Social Distortion, as well as heavier acts like Faith No More and Living Colour. KROQ in the 1990s and continued popularity (1990‚Äì1999) Throughout the 1990s, KROQ's format focused on mainly alternative rock (or alternative metal), grunge, punk pop, Britpop and nu metal, giving up-and-coming bands their first exposure on the station or in Southern California, including Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Smashing Pumpkins, Pearl Jam, Oasis, Foo Fighters, Green Day, The Offspring, Sublime, No Doubt, Rage Against the Machine, Korn, Bad Religion, Weezer, Blink-182, Hole, Garbage and System of a Down. This helped the station surge back to number one in the ratings, for which it remained until the mid-2000s, when it slipped to the middle-of-the-pack, ratings-wise, for Los Angeles area radio stations. The 1990s also saw a continuation of the weekday morning Kevin & Bean Show, as well as \\"Rodney on the Roq,\\" hosted by Rodney Bingenheimer, on Sunday nights. Late at night the station played Loveline, hosted by \\"The Poorman\\" Jim Trenton and Dr. Drew Pinsky. The show's purpose was to bring correct information regarding human sexuality and relationships to those 13 to 25 years of age.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- Other-Documments/LA-Radio-Guide/LA-Radio-Guide-1994-10-11.pdf KROQ also hosted numerous concert events such as Weenie Roast and Almost Acoustic Christmas. In 1997, KROQ/Infinity merged with CBS, later changing its name to CBS Radio. Later history (2000‚Äìpresent) Originally located at 117 S. Los Robles Avenue in Pasadena, the station moved to 3500 W. Olive Avenue in Burbank in 1987 as part of the purchase agreement and to be closer to the music industry. In 2002, the station was moved to a facility at 5901 Venice Boulevard in the Crestview neighborhood in West Los Angeles. Unlike most other (Class B, but with grandfathered greater than B facilities) FM stations in Los Angeles whose transmitters are atop Mount Wilson, KROQ's (Class B) transmitter is located on Tongva Peak in Glendale at an altitude of 2,650 ft., which results in somewhat weaker signal coverage. In 2004, KROQ began broadcasting in HD Radio. On February 20, 2006, KROQ added streaming music from the radio station to its website. On June 9, 2006, KROQ launched an HD sub-carrier, KROQ HD-2, which airs new wave and alternative tracks from the 1980s which were popular during KROQ's heyday (and is also branded \\"KROQ 2: Roq of the 80s\\"). In February 2010, CBS Radio, which controlled the live stream, blocked access for listeners outside of the United States. Steve Jones came to KROQ from Indie 103.1 with a Sunday night show called \\"Jonesy's Jukebox\\", which ran from 7 to 9PM during 2010‚Äì2013 before moving to KLOS. In February 2015, KROQ severed ties with Boyd \\"Doc on the Roq\\" Britton and Lisa May after deciding to drop news and traffic. The news came as a shock for longtime listeners as Doc on the Roq had been reporting news for the station for 27 years while Lisa May had been reporting traffic for the past 24 years. Fans took to Facebook to boycott the station for not renewing their contracts. Although considered one of the legendary radio stations in the country and still a strong revenue generator for parent company CBS, ratings for KROQ have been rather depressed over the last couple of years. In fact, competitor KYSR moved ahead of KROQ in 2015 including a 3.4 to 2.3 lead in the most recent August 2016 Nielsen ratings. On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th. On March 18, 2020, Kevin Ryder announced on Twitter that he, Allie MacKay, Jensen Karp, producer Dave Sanchez and contributor Jonathan Kantrowe, had all been fired from the morning show.Official Kevin Ryder Twitter March 18, 2020 Awards The station was awarded Radio Station of the Year in 1992 and 1993 by Rolling Stone magazine readers poll issues. In 2007, the station was nominated for the top 25 markets Alternative station of the year award by Radio & Records magazine. Other nominees included WBCN in Boston, Massachusetts; KTBZ-FM in Houston, Texas; KITS in San Francisco, California; KNDD in Seattle, Washington; and WWDC in Washington, DC. KROQ was the recipient of an Alternate Contraband Award for Major Market Radio Alternative Radio Station of the Year 2012. KROQ was inducted into the Rock Radio Hall of Fame in 2014. HD Radio KROQ broadcasts an HD Radio subchannel, The ROQ of the 80's, which features classic rock from the 1980s. In August 2018, Entercom announced it would re-launch the subchannel, adding former KROQ personalities Freddy Snakeskin and Tami Heide as DJs.

It was hosted by Kevin Ryder and Gene \\"Bean\\" Baxter. The show was on the air from 1990 to 2019 and interspersed music and news with comedy, celebrity interviews, listener call-ins, and live music performances. Baxter announced his departure from the show in early 2019, with his last show being November 7 of that year. The show continued on with new episodes and Baxter's nickname in its title until January 2, 2020, when the short-lived spin-off morning show Kevin in the Morning with Allie and Jensen debuted. Just over 10 weeks later on March 17, 2020, the spin-off was cancelled with all cast and crew fired, effective the following day. History The show debuted on KROQ on December 31, 1989, when it hosted the annual countdown of the year's best songs. On November 10, 2008, the Kevin and Bean Show started an afternoon segment, \\"Cinco De La Tarde\\" weekdays from 5-6 p.m. As of August 3, 2009, this segment has been discontinued and the morning show has been restored to its original 10:00 AM end time. A Best of Kevin and Bean show called \\"Same Shit, Different Day\\" was added on Saturday mornings airing from 7:00-10:00 AM. On May 11, 2009, Kevin and Bean began syndicating on KEDJ, 103.9 The Edge in Phoenix, Arizona, KFRR 104.1 Fresno and KRZQ-FM Reno. The show is also available as a podcast on iTunes. In February 2015 the Kevin and Bean show let go of long-time contributors, Lisa May and Boyd R. Britton (Doc on the ROQ). May started as a traffic reporter on the program and had grown to become a key contributor of the Kevin and Bean Show during her 24 years with the program, while Doc had been providing the news for 27 years. Kevin and Bean explained that management had made it clear audiences were not tuning in to KROQ for traffic or news, so the painful decision was made to make changes to the show. Allie Mac Kay later joined the show to help fill the role lost by the exit of May. On April 14, 2015, Kevin and Bean were inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame during a ceremony hosted by NAB President (and former Oregon Senator) Gordon Smith. Bean said, \\"We are happy to share the recognition with our great team who works just as hard as we do to make the show successful.\\"http://laradio.com/ April 16, 2015 The three-day NAB trade show is held every April at Las Vegas Convention Center. On March 6, 2019, declaring \\"Thirty years is a good time to stop,\\" Bean announced that he would leave the show before the end of the year and move to England.https://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/184598/kroq- los-angeles-shocker-morning-co-host-bean-to-c His last day on the air was November 7, 2019. On March 18, 2020, Kevin Ryder announced on Twitter that he and the other personalities on \\"Kevin in the Mornings With Allie & Jensen\\" had been fired. Format=Opening segments= Each episode opens with an audio montage (usually created by Baxter) featuring musical and audio clips that draw from current events in politics, pop-culture, and the news. An overview of the day's show is also given, as well as any small talk about the cast's day-to-day lives. =Hourly segments= Music from the standard lineup of KROQ-FM is played regularly during the program. =Recurring segments= Many of the show's periodically recurring segments are based on listener participation and involve the hosts taking calls on a discussion topic or for a guest, or involve games and contests created around promotional giveaways. Ryder and Baxter will also occasionally read emails sent to them, and play messages from the show's voice mail service, known as the \\"Afro Line\\". Other segments focus on the hosts and their personalities and quirks, like \\"Thanks for That Info, Bean\\", which pokes fun at Baxter's intense interest in seemingly trivial topics, and \\"A Moment with...\\", where a humorous audio clip of a statement made on-air by a host is replayed. \\"Would You Like to Take That Back?\\" is another feature during which the hosts give each other the option of \\"taking back\\" an unsuccessful or poorly delivered joke or pun. There are several other segments that frequently happen on the show. \\"Bean Makes Us Guess\\" is when Baxter finds a list from the internet and has the rest of the crew guess the top 10 (such as the Top baby names of 2018). Ryder often does not take the game seriously and makes nonsense guesses. Another segment hosted by Baxter is \\"What's up with Florida?\\", where Baxter brings bizarre stories from the state of Florida. Ryder hosts a similar segment, called \\"People are Dumb\\", where he brings in stories of people making questionable choices. A weekly Thursday segment is hosted by Karp, called \\"Get Up on This\\" (based on his former podcast), where he gets people up on things that people might not know about that he thinks people should. Several segments feature regular guests, including sports updates from both of the Petros and Money Show with Matt \\"Money\\" Smith (former Kevin and Bean Show sports reporter) and Petros Papadakis. Since January 2010, Dr. Drew Pinsky, whose syndicated radio program Loveline was broadcast by KROQ, has also appeared frequently on the program. The show also features a listener call-in segment on Friday's called \\"Keep it 100\\", where listeners can text in to request a song from the station's catalog to play on the air. The 100th caller gets to have their song played on the air. Baxter often presents some facts about the song, and Mac Kay tries to guess the year. =Closing segments= The program generally ends with a short preview of the next show, and on Fridays the show closes (and opens) with a cover of \\"Don't Bogart Me\\" by Robert Bradley's Blackwater Surprise (a song first performed by the band Fraternity of Man), as performed by the hosts. Cast=KevinBean= Baxter was born and resided until his early teens in Bingley, Bradford, West Yorkshire, England, but graduated from Bowie High School in Bowie, Maryland, in 1977, and speaks with an American accent. He is married to Donna H. (Mendivil) Baxter, who works as a fashion designer. After moving from L.A. to Seattle, Bean continued with the show by broadcasting from a room in his house where he had a sound mixing board, recording equipment, a video monitor showing staff in the KROQ studio in Los Angeles, a computer and a microphone attached to a high-quality phone line. =Other cast members and staff= Also on the show at the time it ended were: *Allie Mac Kay co-hosted the program and, along with Ryder and Baxter, was present for nearly all on-air segments. In addition to regular on-air commentary during call-ins and interviews, she occasionally participated in pre-recorded segments and regularly filled in on the Show Biz Beat. A former features reporter with the Los Angeles-based KTLA Morning News team and occasional contributor to the Kevin and Bean Show, she joined the show as a full-time cast member in February 2015. *Dave \\"The King of Mexico\\" Sanchez was the show's producer, who was given the nickname 'King Of Mexico' because even though his parents are both Mexican and fluent in Spanish, he can't speak a word of it. He is a Los Angeles Clippers fan and composes songs extolling the team. When the Clippers fell short of the playoffs in the 2006-2007 season, he was teased for his boasting, including a mocking song submitted by a listener. *Jensen Karp was the most recent co-host on the program. He joined the show October 11, 2018 and served a similar role to former member Ralph Garman. *\\"Beer Mug\\" got his nickname from a beer mug tattoo on his foot. He helped Kevin and Bean in studio on air, running the soundboard. A recurring segment involved sending him to red carpet Hollywood premieres where he failed miserably at interviewing stars. *Omar Khan AKA \\"DJ Omar\\" was the show's main DJ and mostly responsible for its technical aspects. He created many of the jingles for various segments, which were mostly existing songs with alternate lyrics. Khan directed the low-budget film Cucamonga Heat, often referred to on the show, while in school. After being featured in the show, a clip from the film featuring a man (played by Khan) sitting down in a chair and ordering a fake drug deal would often be played during instances where a movie clip should have been played, usually as a joke or to signify that the film being reviewed was bad. This also led to anyone named \\"Eric\\" to be greeted by \\"Yea, Eric\\" when calling in. Every few months, Khan would make a parody of a popular song, often inserting clips of embarrassing on-air mistakes by Kevin and Bean. =Former cast members= Personalities no longer with the show include: *Adam Carolla was Mr. Birchum the woodshop teacher from 1995‚Äì97. *Danielle \\"Chip\\" Lehman was an intern, phone screener, then board operator. The nickname \\"Chip\\" is a result of her work with a previous employer. She is an avid bass player and current member of the band Well Hung Heart. *Frank Murphy was the show's producer from 1993-96. *Jay \\"Lightning\\" Tilles - former producer (promoted from another production position after Murphy left the show), so nicknamed ironically because of his slowness. *Jimmy Kimmel was \\"Jimmy the Sports Guy\\" from 1994‚Äì99, when he left to co-star in \\"The Man Show\\" with Adam Carolla. *Lisa May was the traffic reporter from 1990 to 2015. A running joke on the show involved Kevin and Bean trying to offer other women her job. Every year for Christmas and May's birthday, Kevin and Bean would call QVC and purchase whatever was being sold on television at that moment as her gift, regardless of the price or usefulness of the product. On May 11, 2015, Lisa May joined the morning radio program \\"The Heidi and Frank Show\\" on 95.5 KLOS FM. *Matt \\"Money\\" Smith was the sports commentator after Jimmy Kimmel. Matt left the Kevin and Bean show in 2006, but occasionally still calls in for sports segments. *\\"Michael The Maintenance Man\\" Burton was an actual maintenance man in the building where KROQ had its studios who came to be an active member of the show, performing man-on-the-street interviews and making public appearances. In the fall of 1995, Burton left the show and filed a wrongful- termination suit charging the station, along with Kevin and Bean, with racial and religious discrimination. The suit was settled in late 1996. *\\"Psycho\\" Mike Catherwood started as a board operator for the show, but over the years became a regular on-air contributor to the show, mainly doing character voices and impersonations. Mike left in 2010 to co-host \\"Loveline\\" with Dr. Drew Pinsky. *Ralph Garman was an impressionist and contributor from 1999 to 2017. He handled entertainment news segments and often acted as a substitute when Kevin or Bean were not present. His segment \\"Ralph's Showbiz Beat\\" was one of the features on the show.https://www.dailynews.com/2017/11/30/longtime-kevin- bean-show-co-host-ralph-garman-delivers-an-emotional-farewell-on-kroq/ On November 30, 2017, Garman announced it would be his last show. The reasons for his departure were not included in his emotional goodbye, other than that it was not his choice to leave. *\\"Big Tad\\" Newcomb was an intern made to do embarrassing stunts and ridiculed for his lack of intellect. http://libraryfchistory.fullcoll.edu/photos.php?image_id=1432 *Doc on the ROQ was a news reporter who broadcast hourly. He was terminated at the same time as Lisa May. The B-Team Podcast Current and former members of the Kevin and Bean show, including Lightning, Omar and Dave started a podcast documenting the behind the scenes look at the show in July 2017.https://kroq.radio.com/media/podcast/b-team-podcast Each week they look at back at different bits, or moments in the show's history and help to retell the happenings of the Kevin and Bean show over the years. They also take listener feedback from emails to help address questions people have about the show.

Abstinence is a self-enforced restraint from indulging in bodily activities that are widely experienced as giving pleasure. Most frequently, the term refers to sexual abstinence, or abstinence from alcohol, drugs, or food. Because the regimen is intended to be a conscious act, freely chosen to enhance life, abstinence is sometimes distinguished from the psychological mechanism of repression. The latter is an unconscious state, having unhealthy consequences. Abstinence in religion Abstinence may arise from an ascetic over indulgent, hasidic point of view in natural ways of procreation, present in most faiths, or from a subjective need for spiritual discipline. In its religious context, abstinence is meant to elevate the believer beyond the normal life of desire, to a chosen ideal, by following a path of renunciation. For Jews, the principal day of fast is Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. For Muslims, the period of fasting lasts during the whole month of Ramadan, from dawn to dusk. In both Christianity and Islam, amongst others, pre-marital sex is prohibited. Catholics abstain from food and drink for an hour prior to taking Holy Communion, and from meat on Ash Wednesday and on Fridays except solemnities. In the Anglican Communion, the Book of Common Prayer prescribes certain days as days for fasting and abstinence, \\"consisting of the 40 days of Lent, the ember days, the three rogation days (the Monday to Wednesday following the Sunday after Ascension Day), and all Fridays in the year (except Christmas, if it falls on a Friday)\\". Orthodox Christians abstain from food and drink from midnight on the day they receive Holy Communion, and abstain from meat and dairy on Wednesdays and Fridays throughout the year, as well as during Great Lent. Catholics distinguish between fasting and abstinence; the former referring to the discipline of taking one full meal a day, and the latter signifying the discipline of eating no meat (fish is allowed). Some Protestants, especially Methodists and Baptists, have preferred to abstain from drinking alcohol and the use of tobacco. Mormons abstain from certain foods and drinks by combining spiritual discipline with health concerns. Mormons also fast one day a month, for both spiritual and charitable reasons (the money saved by skipping meals is donated to the needy). The Seventh-day Adventist Church encourages the consumption of only clean meats as specified in Leviticus and strongly discourages the consumption of alcohol, smoking, and the use of narcotics. In India, Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs and Hindus abstain from eating meat and fish (basically, all living animals) on the grounds both of health and of reverence for all sentient forms of life. Total abstinence from feeding on the flesh of cows is a hallmark of Hinduism. In addition, lay and monastic Buddhists refrain from killing any living creature and from consuming intoxicants, and bhikkhus keep vows of chastity. In Theravada Buddhism, bhikkhus also refrain from eating in the afternoon, and cannot accept money. Jains abstain from violence in any form, and will not consume living creatures or kill bugs or insects.Ahimsa in Jainism Medicine In medicine, abstinence is the discontinuation of a drug, often an addictive one. This might, in addition to craving after the drug, be expressed as withdrawal syndromes. In the Basic Text of Narcotics Anonymous, a large fellowship following the 12-steps outlined by AA, NA is outlined to be \\"a program of complete abstinence from all mood or mind-altering substances.\\" This description includes alcohol, because alcohol is a drug, and is widely known to include any kind of prescription narcotics, like pain-killers (opiates), anti-anxiety medicine (benzodiazepines) or diet pills (amphetamines). The practice of abstinence is a learned behavior, and comes slowly over time - time spent listening and sharing in NA and AA meetings, behavioral health psychology group or individualized therapies, and hanging out with people in the recovery support community. Types of abstinence=Food= \\"Woman's Holy War. Grand Charge on the Enemy's Works\\". An allegorical 1874 political cartoon print, which somewhat unusually shows temperance campaigners (alcohol prohibition advocates) as virtuous armored women warriors (riding sidesaddle), wielding axes Carrie-Nation-style to destroy barrels of Beer, Whisky, Gin, Rum, Brandy, Wine and Liquors, under the banners of \\"In the name of God and humanity\\" and \\"Temperance League\\". The foremost woman bears the shield seen in the Seal of the United States (based on the U.S. flag), suggesting the patriotic motivations of temperance campaigners. The shoe and pants-leg of a fleeing male miscreant are seen at lower right. Fasting is primarily the act of willingly abstaining from some or all food, drink, or both, for a period of time. A fast may be total or partial concerning that from which one fasts, and may be prolonged or intermittent as to the period of fasting. Fasting practices may preclude sexual activity as well as food, in addition to refraining from eating certain types or groups of foods; for example, one might refrain from eating meat. A complete fast in its traditional definition is abstinence of all food and liquids except for water. Vegetarianism is the practice of a diet that excludes meat (including game, marine mammals and slaughter by-products), poultry, fowl, fish, shellfish and other sea creatures. There are several variants of the diet, some of which also exclude eggs or products produced from animal labour such as dairy products and honey. =Tobacco smoking= Smoking cessation is the action leading towards the discontinuation of the consumption of a smoked substance, mainly tobacco, but it may encompass cannabis and other substances as well. =Alcohol= Teetotalism is the practice and promotion of complete abstinence from alcoholic beverages. Some common reasons for choosing teetotalism are religious, health, family, philosophical or social reasons, and, sometimes, as simply a matter of taste preference. When at drinking establishments, they either abstain from drinking or consume non-alcoholic beverages such as tea, coffee, water, juice, and soft drinks. Contemporary and colloquial usage has somewhat expanded teetotalism to include strict abstinence from most \\"recreational\\" intoxicants (legal and illegal, see controlled substances). Most teetotaller organizations also demand from their members that they do not promote or produce alcoholic intoxicants. =Pleasure= A general abstinence from pleasures or leisure, either partial or full, may be motivated by ambition, career or general self-respect (excluding the point of view that even the latter examples may be regarded as sources of pleasure). It is widely accepted that abstinence from addictive drugs gives successful outcome. However, it is not certain whether a general abstinence from pleasures of leisure yields higher productivity. Too much work generates stress and its potential adverse effects. Furthermore, the effort itself to achieve abstinence may consume willpower from its ultimate purpose. Total abstinence from pleasure or leisure is practically impossible and instead an individual work-life balance is necessary. =Sexual abstinenceOrganizations= *Alcoholics Anonymous *Narcotics Anonymous *Pagans in Recovery *Rehabilitation for Addicted Prisoners Trust (RAPT)  See also  References External links Asceticism Drug rehabilitation Twelve- step programs ","title":"Abstinence"},{"id":"18589548","text":"Clearlake Highlands is a former unincorporated community now incorporated in Clearlake, in Lake County, California. It is located on the north shore of the southeast end of Clear Lake, just south of the village of Clearlake Park, 15 miles (24 km) east-southeast of Lakeport, at an elevation of 1348 feet (411 m). Clearlake was originally settled by Americans in the late 1860s. Prior to settlement by Americans the area was inhabited by Pomo Indians. Their artifacts and grave sites have been found along Cache Creek at the Southern city limit as well as the area around Borax Lake in the northwest portion of the city. Clearlake remained a farming and ranching community until the 1920s when it became a resort destination along with other areas in Lake County. A large portion of the area which was to become the City of Clearlake was subdivided in 1925. Most of the city lots are only 50' by 100' feet and none of the infrastructure was established at the time of subdivision. A majority of the roads were never paved and some only exist on paper. Clearlake has historically depended on tourism as its main industry with the attraction being Clear Lake. This has been a boom or bust cycle over the decades depending on several factors.

The Pilgrims at Plymouth Colony learned these recipes in the early 1620s and likely added barley to the corn meal to invent New England brown bread. The triangular trade of slaves in the 18th century helped to make Boston an exporter of rum, which is produced by the distillation of fermented molasses. At that time, molasses was added to local baked bean recipes, creating Boston baked beans. In colonial New England, baked beans were traditionally cooked on Saturdays and left in brick ovens overnight. On Sundays, the beans were still hot, allowing people to indulge in a hot meal and still comply with Sabbath restrictions.

In English Renaissance theatre, the prompter managed the company's performances, ensuring that they went according to plan; he also supervised and maintained the troupe's dramatic manuscripts, its \\"playbooks.\\" It was in this sense that the prompter \\"held\\" and \\"kept\\" the \\"books\\" of the company. And when censorship problems arose, the prompter had to resolve them. Nothing is known of Knight's personal history; he is known only through his professional activities. Prior to his service with the King's Men, he functioned as prompter for a competing company, Prince Charles's Men; he witnessed a contract between Philip Henslowe and the actors in March 1616.Grace Ioppolo, Dramatists and Their Manuscripts in the Age of Shakespeare, Jonson, Middleton, and Heywood, London, Routledge, 2004; p. 76. After some years with the King's Men, he was apparently regarded as a key member of the company's supporting staff: on 27 December 1624, Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, issued a roster of 21 \\"musicians and other necessary attendants\\" of the King's Men who could not be arrested or \\"pressed for soldiers\\" without the permission of either Herbert or the Lord Chamberlain, then William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke. Knight's name is first on the list. (The 16th name on the list is Anthony Knight, perhaps a relative.)F. E. Halliday, A Shakespeare Companion 1564-1964, Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; pp. 268, 391. Knight prepared the company's play texts for production, adding stage directions, cues for offstage sounds, and other necessary information to turn an author's or scribe's manuscript into a promptbook. Several play manuscripts in Knight's hand survive -- for Beggars' Bush, Bonduca, The Faithful Friends, and The Honest Man's Fortune. (Knight's manuscript for Bonduca is not a promptbook but a presentation MS. In the MSS. of both Bonduca and The Fautfhul Friends, Knight leaves gaps because he is transcribing the author's drafts, the \\"foul papers,\\" and sometimes cannot read the defective texts.)Ioppolo, pp. 76, 135. Knight's job of annotating manuscripts for use as promptbooks throws light on practical aspects of the stagecraft of the era, and also the censorship problems that plagued the dramatists and actors. Philip Massinger's authorial MS. of his Believe as You List reveals official censorship in action, and bears notes and revisions in Knight's hand. (In the Believe as You List MS., Knight marked the actors' entrances three of four lines prior to their first speaking; they needed the time to traverse the large stage of the Globe Theatre.)Andrew Gurr, The Shakespeare Company 1594-1642, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004; p. 122. A second document from the hand of Sir Henry Herbert, addressed personally to Knight, is especially notable. On 21 October 1633, Herbert returned the MS. of The Woman's Prize to Knight, ordering him to do a better job of removing \\"oaths, prophaness, and publique ribaldrye\\", and threatening Knight with consequences if he doesn't do better: \\"you will answer it at your perill.\\" Shakespeare scholars have devoted a good measure of attention to the specifics of Knight's practice and his handwriting, looking for insight into the effect Knight may have had on the details of Shakespeare's texts.Paul Werstein, \\"Close Contrivers: Nameless Collaborators in Early Modern London Plays,\\" in: The Elizabethan Theatre XV, C.

After a 1946 outbreak of a rickettsial-type disease at an apartment complex in Kew Gardens, Queens, an investigation was performed to identify the source of the infections.

The Mus musculus mice were found to be carrying mites, identified as the house mouse mite, Allodermanyssus sanguineus. Self-trained entomologist Charles Pomerantz asked permission to search the site and found the mites at various sites throughout the building, with blood-engorged mites found near chutes leading to the incinerator.

It is scored for the rare combination of clarinet, string quartet and piano. Fifteen years later the composer prepared a version for chamber orchestra, his ‚ÄúOp. 34 bis‚Äù or Op. 34a, retaining a separate part for piano but featuring solo cello as much as solo clarinet. Until recently the chamber orchestra version had been the better known, being easily programmable by orchestras, while the original version (for six instruments) requires out-of-the-way planning on the part of a string quartet. But two recordings have drawn attention to the original: Michel Portal clarinet, Parrenin Quartet, Michel B√©roff piano (1974); and Giora Feidman clarinet, Juilliard String Quartet, Yefim Bronfman piano (1994). Background Prokofiev arrived in New York in September 1918. Early in 1919, he was commissioned by a Russian sextet called the Zimro Ensemble, which had just arrived in America from the Far East on a world tour sponsored by the Russian Zionist Organization. The members played the instruments in this work's instrumentation, and were led by their clarinetist Simeon Bellison, who was trained in Moscow and had been principal clarinettist of the Mariinsky Theatre from 1915. (Bellison would soon become principal clarinet with the New York Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra.) They gave Prokofiev a notebook of Jewish folksongs, though the melodies Prokofiev chose have never been traced to any authentic sources. It has been suggested that Bellison had actually composed them himself in the Jewish style . The other members of the ensemble were Jacob Mestechkin, first violin, G. Besrody, second violin, K. Moldavan, viola, Joseph Cherniavsky, cello, and Leo Berdichevsky, piano , although one source names the second violinist as Michael Rosenker, who was 19 years old at the time . It received its premiere at the Bohemian Club in New York, on 2 February 1920, with Prokofiev as guest pianist. Before they disbanded in 1922, the Zimro Ensemble performed it again at least twice at Carnegie Hall‚Äîwith their own pianist, Berdichevsky, in 1921, and possibly with guest pianist Lara Cherniavsky in December 1920 . Prokofiev regarded the work as conceived essentially for a sextet, and long resisted suggestions of arranging it for other forces. In September 1930, he remarked, \\"I don‚Äôt understand what sort of obtuse people could have found it necessary to reorchestrate it\\" but, nevertheless, he was persuaded to make a version for chamber orchestra in 1934, published as Op. 34a . The orchestrated version is performed less often, because it lacks the earthiness and uncanny timbral balance of the original . Prokofiev did not regard the work very highly. When a Scots critic, Andrew Fraser, published an article in 1929 describing the Overture as \\"a beautiful and pathetic work\\", the composer wrote in response, \\"its technique is conventional, its form is bad (4 + 4 + 4 + 4)\\". When his friend Nikolai Myaskovsky praised the second theme, Prokofiev retorted, with reference to the work's coda, \\"from the musical point of view, the only worthwhile part, if you please, is the final section, and that, I think, is probably the result of my sweetness and diatonicism\\" . Analysis Its structure follows the form of a fairly conventional sonata form. It is in the key of C minor. The clarinet and the cello are prominent, introducing the first and second themes respectively. However, all instruments are balanced well, and each instrument plays both themes, often in imitation. Zimro's pianist, Leo Berdichevsky, was a graduate of the Petrograd and Berlin conservatories . The first theme, Un poco allegro, has a jumpy and festive rhythm, unmistakably evoking klezmer music by alternating low and high registers and using \\"hairpin\\" dynamics. The second theme, Pi√π mosso, is a nostalgic cantabile theme introduced in the cello and then passed to the first violin . References .

P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen, most commonly affecting immunocompromised patients, such as those with cystic fibrosis or AIDS. Infection can affect many parts of the body, but infections typically target the respiratory tract (e.g. patients with CF or those on mechanical ventilation), causing bacterial pneumonia. In a surveillance study between 1986 and 1989, P. aeruginosa was the third leading cause of all nosocomial infections, and specifically the number one leading cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia and third leading cause of hospital-acquired UTI. Treatment of such infections can be difficult due to multiple antibiotic resistance, and in the United States, there was an increase in MDRPA (Multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa) resistant to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, and aminoglycosides, from 0.9% in 1994 to 5.6% in 2002. P. oryzihabitans can also be a human pathogen, although infections are rare. It can cause peritonitis, endophthalmitis, sepsis and bacteremia. Similar symptoms although also very rare can be seen by infections of P. luteola. P. plecoglossicida is a fish pathogenic species, causing hemorrhagic ascites in the ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis). P. anguilliseptica is also a fish pathogen.

Located at 905 North Conway Boulevard it is in the city's central business district. Built in 1942 it continues to operate as an entertainment venue. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 28 August 1998. The theater was the flagship operation for the Rio Grande Valley theater owners Robert N. and Dell Smith. They hired Dallas architect William J. Moore to design the building and George Holliday was the general contractor. The opening of Moore Army Air Corps Field in 1941 created a market for entertainment. The Smith brothers at one point had five facilities in South Texas. The movie shown at the opening on 3 April 1942 was a Roy Rogers film, Heart of the Rio Grande. The facade presents elements of Pueblo Revival architecture with its stucco exterior, faux vigas and heavy wooden lintels. Stucco covers the entire front of the building wrapping around each side. Vigas are evenly spaced across the facade three feet below the roofline and above the portico. A large marquee attached to the facade and extending above the roofline bears the theater's name in large red letters. A five sided ticket booth is flanked by inset entrance doors. The ticket booth is bordered with terracotta tiles and faced with several decorative tiles with southwestern scenes. The theater has seating for 500 on a main floor and balcony. The balcony retains the original \\"Floating Comfort\\" International seating while the main floor seating was replaced in 1967. Two large murals fill the long side walls of the theater. These murals show idealized scenes of Hispanic life in the area before Anglo occupation. Originally fluorescent paint was used so, illuminated with blacklight these murals could be seen when the house lights were dimmed. They were painted in 1942 by artist E. Risser of the Dallas firm King Scene Company from images copyrighted by McCrossen Manufacturing Company of Santa Fe. The two and three story building faces east onto Conway Blvd. One in a row of commercial buildings it is the dominant architectural resource on the block. It is built with a wood frame and common-bond brick veneer. The north and south walls are stepped parapets with buttress-like brickwork adding visual support and matching the step downs. These tall walls are visible above the nearby buildings. The facade is an asymmetrical 2 part composition. In an arrangement typical of movie theaters of the time the theater and a small store occupy a 3-story part of the building with a 2-story wing extending north. There is a small retail space to the south of the entrance also finished with stucco and terracotta. The two story northern portion of the building is a separate commercial space with large display windows and a door at an angle to the street. This space is also similarly finished. Upstairs windows feature heavy wooden lintels and decorative wooden grates. A large spandrel beam extends the full length of the facade. When originally finished the building included office spaces, a clinic, two store and two apartments. In the 1990s a metal canopy spanning the entire facade was replaced with a narrow hip roof of Spanish tile over the entry. The screen was replaced with a wide view Cinemascope screen in 1952. Despite these and other minor changes the theater retains the design and atmosphere of the time of its construction. It remains a rare well preserved example of Pueblo Revival architecture in an area where Spanish Colonial Revival architecture predominates.

Frozen tissue array consists of fresh frozen tissues in which up to 50 separate tissue cores are assembled in array fashion to allow simultaneous histological analysis. History Paraffin tissue array was developed during late years in the 1980s; this array can help scientists high throughput analyze gene and protein expressions in multiple tissue samples, especially analyze different protein levels with antibodies by immunohistochemistry. Various paraffin tissue arrays are now commercially available from many biotech companies. Most of the arrays can be easily made by microarraying instrument (Beecher Instruments Inc.). However, paraffin embedded tissues have limitations. Buffered formalin solutions cross link proteins and nucleic acids when they are used for fix tissues. The DNA, RNA, and protein within the tissues are damaged in various levels during the fixation. Therefore, lots of scientific experimental results from formalin fixed tissues are not reliable. Since frozen tissue sections don‚Äôt go through any fixation procedures, and therefore, the DNA, RNA, and protein in frozen tissues retain their native characteristics much more than in paraffin embedded tissues. Scientists who have been developing antibodies for therapeutic purpose all need their preliminary results from frozen tissues to get approval from FDA. Consequently, frozen tissue array should be the best tool for high throughput analysis on this purpose. Procedure Frozen tissue cores with 2 mm diameter from the regions of interest are removed from frozen tissue OCT blocks at different freezing temperature since each tissue type has their own temperature preference at frozen stage. Then all the frozen tissue cores are inserted in a recipient OCT frozen block in a precisely spaced, array pattern. Sections from this block are cut using a cryostat, mounted on a microscope slide and then analyzed by any method of standard histological analysis. Each frozen tissue array block can be cut into 100‚Äì500 sections, which can be subjected to independent tests. Tests commonly employed in frozen tissue array include immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization.

A mystery writer and his wife try to solve a murder when a corpse appears in their Greenwich Village apartment. Plot Nancy (Loretta Young) and Jeff Troy (Brian Aherne) move into a somber-looking basement apartment building on 13 Gay Street, Greenwich Village, where the residents all act very strangely. Nancy recognizes one of the residents, Anne Carstairs (Jeff Donnell), who acts very oddly and not at all the way Nancy remembers her. While eating in a restaurant, Nancy overhears a man, later identified as Louis Kaufman, talking on the telephone telling someone to meet him in the basement apartment. Louis goes to the basement apartment and is later found dead in the backyard, after having been drowned in the apartment's bathtub. Jeff recognizes the basement apartment as a former speakeasy and that the \\"monster\\" the housekeeper was afraid of is a turtle called \\"Old Hickory\\". Jeff and Nancy figure out that all the residents were being blackmailed by a man named Andrew Bruhl, who used to be a private investigator. Bruhl made all the blackmail victims live in one building to keep an eye on them. Jeff and Nancy figure out that Bruhl killed Kaufman, and that Bruhl is someone who lives in the building. The suspects are Anne Carstairs (Jeff Donnell); her husband, Scott Carstairs (William Wright); Eddie Turner, the landlord; Polly Franklin (Lee Patrick), who works at the restaurant; Lingle (Richard Gaines), another resident; and the housekeeper, Mrs. Salter (Blanche Yurka).

It was one of the last American films to be produced during World War II, released only a little over a month after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the official surrender of Japan. Notably, it's also the first- ever film to feature or reference the atomic bombings. Plot After staging a successful bombing raid on Tokyo, Air Force pilot Steve Ross returns to San Francisco, where he reminisces about his lost love, army nurse Abby Drake, who he believes perished while on duty in Bataan. Steve's leave is curtailed when he is ordered to report to Washington and asked to volunteer for a special mission. Because Steve was reared in Japan and is fluent in the language, the army proposes that he undergo plastic surgery to become a \\"Japanese\\" so that he can infiltrate the army and contact scientist Lewis Jardine, a prisoner of war who possesses the formula to build an atomic bomb. Steve accepts the mission and after the surgery is sent to a city near Hong Kong, where he becomes known as Tomu Takishima, a Japanese soldier who is being shipped back to Japan after being discharged for battle shock. As Steve's ship nears Tokyo, he jumps overboard and, after swimming ashore, walks to the Kamuri concentration camp, where Jardine is being held prisoner. At the camp, Steve is assigned to work at the supply depot and there meets Haan-Soo, a Korean errand boy who is a member of the underground working with the U.S. When Haan- Soo tells Steve that Jardine has been hospitalized with black fever, Steve gets himself reassigned to the hospital by bribing Major Nogira, the medical director who has been pilfering hospital supplies. Steve's assignment must be approved by Colonel Hideko Okunura, the perceptive camp commander, who was also Steve's college roommate. Okunura fails to recognize his old roommate, but is certain that he has met the new soldier somewhere before. At the supply room, Steve encounters Abby, who has been captured by the Japanese and assigned the position of head nurse at the hospital. When Jardine, who has been working at the munitions plant, returns to the hospital that night, Steve contacts him. At first Jardine doubts that the Japanese soldier is really an American agent, but Steve convinces him. Soon after, Okunura makes an advance toward Abby, and when she rejects him, he takes revenge on Nogira, who has also tried to seduce the nurse. Accusing Nogiea of larceny, Okunura demotes him and then orders him to commit suicide. After Nogiea complies, Okunura accuses the nurses of his murder and orders Abby to report to his office. There, Okunura again tries to seduce Abby but is interrupted when Steve arrives with proof of Nogiea's suicide, thus freeing Abby to leave. Okunura orders Steve whipped for his insubordination, and as Abby tends to his wounds, she experiences confusing emotions toward him. Later, Steve confesses to Jardine that he and Abby were engaged and the pilot's wings she wears are his. Although the plan had been for Jardine to transmit the data to Steve, Steve decides that he, Abby and Jardine must all escape quickly before the tenacious Okunura uncovers his identity. An escape plan is devised for that night, but when Haan-Soo learns that Okunura has sent for ‚ÄúTakishima‚Äôs‚Äù supposed former commander to verify his identity, Jardine suggests setting an explosion at the munitions factory as a diversion. As Haan-Soo leaves for the plant, Okunura summons Abby to a party at his house. Under the ruse of delivering an officer to the party, Steve drives to the commander's house with Jardine hidden in the backseat of the car. At the house, Okunura has sequestered Abby in a room and is about to rape her when he sees Steve being chased across the lawn by a watchdog. Recognizing Steve as his old roommate by the way he sprints, Okunura exposes him to the assembled officers and is about to kill him when the munitions plant explodes, throwing Okunura and the others to the floor. After strangling Okunura, Steve rescues Abby and reveals his true identity to her. With the officers in pursuit, Steve, Abby and Jardine flee to the beach, where they are to be rescued by a boat. There, they are met by Haan-Soo, who joins Steve in holding off the soldiers while Abby and Jardine sail to safety. Steve and Haan-Soo's sacrifice allows for the development and deployment of the atomic bomb, assuring that \\"mankind can walk unafraid in peace with goodwill toward men.\\" Cast * Tom Neal as Major Steve Ross / Sergeant Tomu Takashima * Barbara Hale as Abby Drake * Keye Luke as Haan-Soo * Richard Loo as Colonel Hideko Okanura * Marc Cramer as Dr. Lewis Jardine * Leonard Strong as Major Nogira * Benson Fong as Captain Tanahe * Clarence Lung as Major Ichibo * Keye Chang as Captain Sato * Michael St. Angel as Captain Andrew Kent * Peter Chong as Dr. Kai Koon * Edwin Luke as Ling Wang * Wallis Clark as Dr. Langley * John Hamilton as Dr. Stacey * Kenneth MacDonald as Colonel Thompson * Selmer Jackson as Colonel Blaine * Robert Clarke as Narrator History Originally the film centered on Ross helping to acquire a new kind of gun.

It was designed by Mark Gunderson to illustrate mechanical concepts.  History and design  Mainline shaft and pulley from corn grinder The Gunderson Do-All Machine includes more than 30 individual machines that are linked together by an array of belts, gears, pulleys, and transmissions. Collectively, they operate in a continuous chain reaction on the power of one Whitte gas oil well engine, forming a kinetic sculpture. The entire network is mounted on a flat bed trailer platform, so that it can be transported to engine shows, educational venues, and county fairs. The combined weight of the trailer and all components is about 6000 pounds. The Do-All's layout and design allows one to follow the chain reaction from machine to machine while observing the internal cogs, gears, and other components that make them work. The variety of machines include an automatically reversing worm gear, a water pump impellar, a governor/gas valve from a 20-horsepower (HP) JC engine, a blacksmith blower/bubble maker, the main line shaft and pulley from an antique corn grinder, a floating gear, a DC 110-volt generator and lights, a 38-to-1 gear reducer, a bicycle light generator, and a fan blower painted to look like a clown.

His magnum opus, the Torcimany, is one of the most important medieval Catalan-language grammars to modern historians.Its title means \\"Interpreter\\" or \\"Translator\\", from the Arabic turjiman, akin to Spanish truchim√°n, see John Forster, trans. (1878), The Chronicle of James I of Aragon, Glossary, 709. Its first modern edition was published in 1956 by Josep Maria Casas Homs for the Instituto Miguel de Cervantes. His name is spelled Llu√≠s d'Aver√ß√≥ or d'Avers√≥ in modern orthography. Aver√ß√≥ was born to a family of naval shipowners in Barcelona in the middle of the fourteenth century.For a biographical sketch of Aver√ß√≥, see Mart√≠ de Riquer i Morera (1964), Hist√≤ria de la Literatura Catalana, vol. 1 (Barcelona: Edicions Ariel), 560. He continued in the family business and profited from it financially all his life. He appears to be well-trained in law, for he participated in the municipal government of Barcelona throughout his life, being a councillor (conseller) in 1395 and again in 1403. During the interregnum of 1410-12 he was charged by the Parliament of Catalonia with arbitrating some disputes amongst the citizens of Lleida. He later represented Barcelona on a diplomatic mission to Majorca. His diverse interests economic, literary, military, and political brought him favour with the monarchs John I (\\"the Lover of Elegance\\") and Martin (\\"the Humane\\"). No poems by Aver√ß√≥ survive, though his reputation in the poetic world of his time is undeniable.For Aver√ß√≥'s poetry, see Riquer, 560. He and Jaume March II persuaded John I to inaugurate the jocs florals at Barcelona and establish a Consistori de la Gaya Sci√®n√ßa there. On 20 February 1393 John named Jaume and Aver√ß√≥ the first judges of the Consistori's contests (jocs). On 12 August 1399 their position was reaffirmed by king Martin. Aver√ß√≥'s poetic reputation is further established by his Torcimany, which contain a wealth of information for composing poetry in Catalan. Torcimany survives in a single autograph in the library of the Escorial.It has been described as \\"a manual to help Catalan poets fake a better usage of Proven√ßal\\" by J. M. Sobr√© (1982), \\"Ausi√†s March, the Myth of Language, and the Troubadour Tradition\\", Hispanic Review, 50:3 (Summer), 330. For a fuller treatment of its relationship to the \\"language of the troubadours\\", see Mark D. Johnston (1981), \\"The Translation of the Troubadour Tradition in the Torcimany of Lluis d'Aver√ß√≥\\", Philological Quarterly, 60:2 (Spring), pp. 151-167, and Jos√© Romeu Figueras (1954), \\"El cantar paralel√≠stico en Catalu√±a: sus relaciones con el de Galicia y Portugal y el de Castilla\\", Anuario musical, 9, 18-25, 35-36. Its diffusion was almost null, its influence equally so, and its citation nonexistent. Not even Jaume March's Libre de concordances, which served the same purpose--a dictionary of rhymes (diccionari de rimes)--as the appendix of Aver√ß√≥'s Torcimany, shows any evidence of cross-fertilisation or influence. The two poets, who knew each other personally, wrote two similar but independent works. Torcimany cannot be confidently dated beyond the final third of the century. It is divided into three sections, the first on the basic concepts of grammar, the second (del trobar, \\"on composition\\") on the genres (dictats) of poetry, and the third on more difficult aspects of grammar and rhetoric, such as comp√†s (rhythm).In part one, Aver√ß√≥ discusses letters, graphics, diphthongs, syllables, and accents, among other things. He lists eleven main genres in the second: the vers, canso, sirventes, dansa, descort, tenso, partimen, pastorela, retroencha, planh, and escondig. He also differentiates the bord√≥ (line) from the cobla (stanza) and delineates the various vices (vicis) that poets can commit. In the third part he deals with consonance, rhyme, declension, nouns, tense, genre, and person. The third part itself is divided into sections (Riquer, 561). Torcimany is not too different from the Compendi of Joan de Castellnou or the Flors del gay saber of Guilhem Molinier.According to Robert Archer (1991), \\"Tradition, Genre, Ethics and Politics in Ausi√†s March's maldit\\", Bulletin of Hispanic Studies, 68:3 (July), 376, the Torcimany is based on the Leys d'amors of the Consistori de Tolosa, of which the Flors is one redaction. The dictionary of rhymes with which it ends, however, is unique to it; and Aver√ß√≥ does not appear to have had access to the Donatz proensals of Uc Faidit. He appears to have compiled his dictionary from memory and probably for this reason he includes words that would be difficult to employ in the type of verse he seeks to enable. Generally his words have Catalan endings, but a good portion are clearly Occitan, the language of the troubadours. A few on top of that are Castilian or Aragonese, which he clarifies with their Catalan equivalents. These Castilianisms are also unnecessary for Catalan poetry, but Aver√ß√≥ was fixed upon extending his rhymary.Riquer, 562, explains the odd choices Aver√ß√≥ made for his dictionary. Among the Castilianisms he notes padre, madre, pulga, risa, esquina, perro, lomo, libra, rota, escutxa, serr√†, lutxa, and etx√†. Some of these are given Catalanised spellings (i.e. ch‚Üítx).

Early years Born in Newnan, Georgia, in 1942, Smith attended Morehouse College where he developed his appetite for activism. Work with Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Frank Smith Jr. had left school to organize what is called SNCC (Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee), where they helped bring to people's attention that segregation was wrong and that nonviolence was the way to solve this problem. Frank had initially planned only to leave school until the next quarter started, but he had ended up staying six years. When Emmett Till was murdered, there was a note attached saying that \\"This is what happens when you civil rights workers come and then leave.\\" (Forner, Karlyn). The note had motivated Frank to stay for longer than he had intended, which caused him to drop out of school entirely. Frank didn't want to be the reason why more African American's were lynched, so he felt as though he had to stay because his peer's lives depended on it. Now that he had left school all those years back, he now has to remain working at 73 years old to pay off for all those missed years. (Bond, Michael) In 1960, Smith participated in the Rich's Department Store boycotts in Atlanta; and almost at the same time he was working with other students to establish Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. As a founding member of Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Smith is recognized by his Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee peers as the first Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee worker sent into Mississippi to register voters. While based in Holly Springs, Mississippi, Smith worked in some of the most brutal and racist counties in Mississippi. Smith was also one of the few Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee workers employed in the original Head Start program. Working with the Child Development Group of Mississippi, Smith's Head Start program was based in Jacksonville, Mississippi, in the heart of the Mississippi Delta. Smith worked with native Mississippi sharecroppers who had been evicted from their homes when they requested a pay raise in the men's salaries from a flat rate of $6.00 per day to $1.25 per hour. The sharecroppers, Frank and his first wife, Jean Smith, purchased land, lived in tents where they were regular and ongoing targets for the plantation owner and friends during the year when they built housing, and established one of the first (and only) black cooperative communities in Mississippi‚ÄîStrike City. As part of Freedom Summer, Smith and Frank Soracco, another Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee worker, traveled the United States to raise funds for travel and expenses for the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and his friend and colleague, Fannie Lou Hamer to attend the 1964 Democratic National Convention. With the help of Vice President Hubert Humphrey and party leader Walter Mondale, Johnson engineered a compromise in which the Democratic National Committee offered the Mississippi Freedom Party two at-large seats, allowing them to watch the floor proceedings but not take part. The Mississippi Freedom Party refused this compromise, which permitted the undemocratic, white-only, regulars to keep their seats and denied votes to the Mississippi Freedom Party. While they were unsuccessful at being seated, their presence and Hamer's testimony led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. During the Civil Rights Movement, Frank had organized two writers to write what was called \\"The Student Voice\\" (Published in Atlanta), which Frank referred to as \\"The movement newspaper.\\" The paper talked about the Atlanta movement and other little towns around the area. (Bond, Michael). The movement paper was critical to the SNCC community in spreading the word of freedom and justice for all. Frank also helped integrate schools and helped with transportation to and from school. He did this by helping tutor the children who were going to be integrating the schools when most other activists wouldn't because of the fear of what would happen to them if they helped. Frank also said, \\"I drove them to school in my Volkswagen bus.\\" (ByAvis Thomas-Lester). Together they sang freedom songs and made the kids feel loved and safe on their journey to school and back. Political career After leaving Mississippi, Smith relocated to Washington, D.C., where he continued his service to community. Frank was elected to the D.C. Board of Education in 1979 and subsequently to the Council of the District of Columbia in 1982, where he served for 16 years. His work focused on housing and economic development. While on the Council, he served as chair of the Housing and Economic Development Committee, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, and the Baseball Commission. As a council member, he shared his passion for gardening by introducing legislation to maintain the original victory gardens and to allow District residents to garden on vacant, District- owned properties. Smith's urban housing activities included setting up the original Neimiah project in the District of Columbia and introducing legislation for urban homesteading. He also served as chair of the District of Columbia Housing Authority. Smith's office records from his time as a District council member are under the care of the Special Collections Research Center at the George Washington University.Preliminary Guide to the Frank Smith, Jr. Papers, 1987-1998, Special Collections Research Center, Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library, The George Washington University Nonprofit organization leadership After Smith's term on the Council, he focused on his passion, African American history, and found funding to build the African-American Civil War Memorial, establish a nonprofit organization that supports the African American Civil War Museum. Smith is the founding executive director and board member of the African American Civil War Memorial Freedom Foundation and Museum. References *Bond, Michael, director.

Until its demolition in 2011 it was the oldest continuously-operating Route 66 motel in New Mexico and \\"one of the five most important motels left\\" in Albuquerque. History The Aztec Motel was built in 1932 as the first of what would eventually be dozens of auto courts lining Central Avenue, which became U.S. Route 66 4 years later. During a remodeling of the building in the 1950s, the garages were walled in, bringin the number of units from 13 to 17, and a new neon sign replaced the original one. It was listed on the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties and the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. The building was well known locally for its exterior decorations, which consisted of hundreds of found objects assembled in the 1990s by a resident of the motel. The work was described in the Albuquerque Journal as a \\"beloved local folk art installation\\". Aztec Motel sign seen from Central Ave. In 2003, the Aztec Motel received a fund from the National Park Service Route 66 Corridor Preservation Program to restore its neon sign. The Aztec Motel was razed in early June 2011. The motel's owners cited its deteriorating condition and high maintenance costs as reasons for the demolition, estimating the building would cost $1 million to renovate. The motel's neon sign was left standing and was intended to be part of future development on the site. However, the sign ended up being removed in March 2015. The city declared its intention to restore and reinstall it at a to-be-determined location.

The strings of noodles are usually only as thin as a toothpick; the texture is firm enough so the noodles do not fall apart, but is not at all sticky to keep the dish light and suitable for a breakfast treat. Also known as question cake or pie. Origin B√°nh h·ªèi originated from the B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province of Vietnam's South Central Coast region. People in B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh eat b√°nh h·ªèi for almost any meal during the day, instead of rice or noodle soups.http://tuoitre.vn/tin/ao- trang/20090902/banh-hoi-dat-vo/334019.html Production Making b√°nh h·ªèi is a multistep process. First, good rice is soaked in water overnight, then washed with water again three or four times until the water comes out clear. Then the rice is either ground with water into a mixture, or ground without water, but mixed into water three or four times afterward to leaven it without using any additional agent. The flour mixture is then either steamed and kneaded, or cooked in a pan, stirred continuously until it starts to coagulate, but no flour gets stuck on the stirring tool. This step is crucial in making b√°nh h·ªèi soft, light, and not sticky, but the strings of noodles will still have a firm texture. When the experienced b√°nh h·ªèi maker feels the dough is done, it is ready for pressing. Special copper or aluminum cylinders, with several small holes (the size of a needle eye), shape the cooked dough into noodle form. Pressing the dough requires great strength, as the dough is hard and the holes are small, so it is usually done with leverage. When one person presses the dough, another \\"catches\\" the noodles coming out on the other side, presses them together and cuts them off every 10 cm or so, creating a kind of mesh of noodle, which is then laid onto a flat surface, but not in layers. Finally, the sheets are steamed one last time for about five minutes.http://phuyennet.vn/khcndp/index.php?menu=detail‚à£=54&nid;=365 Trang Th√¥ng tin KHCN Ph√∫ Y√™n Serving A dish of b√°nh h·ªèi in Ho Chi Minh City. Like b√∫n (rice vermicelli) dishes, b√°nh h·ªèi is served cold. Traditionally b√°nh h·ªèi in B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh is rolled into bundles and always served with chopped garlic chives. The garlic chives are quickly stir-fried with oil, its aroma and taste goes well with b√°nh h·ªèi, which makes the dish enjoyable by itself and without any other kinds of herbs. In central Vietnam, such as Hu·∫ø, b√°nh h·ªèi is eaten with dried prawns and n∆∞·ªõc ch·∫•m. In southern Vietnam, b√°nh h·ªèi is eaten with a variety of meats, especially roast pork or duck. There are also b√°nh h·ªèi ch·∫£ gi√≤, b√°nh h·ªèi with shrimp paste on sugar cane stick, and b√°nh h·ªèi with grilled pork, chicken, or beef. At the G√≤ Du·ªëi market in Xu√¢n L·ªôc commune, S√¥ng C·∫ßu district, Ph√∫ Y√™n Province, one also finds b√°nh h·ªèi l√≤ng heo G√≤ Du·ªëi, which is b√°nh h·ªèi with boiled pig offal. Since making b√°nh h·ªèi is a skillful process, the dish is highly regarded, and is served at ceremonial parties, such as wedding and ancestor memorial days. Covering b√°nh h·ªèi tightly reduces surface drying, which can make it sour, so market sellers put fresh b√°nh h·ªèi in bamboo baskets with banana leaves, and usually leave it open to air. For convenience or sanitary reasons, there are dried, packaged b√°nh h·ªèi, similar to dried, packaged rice vermicelli, for people who want to cook it themselves instead of buying fresh b√°nh h·ªèi from the markets.

Lead vocalist Rob Chaos is also co-owner of SOS Records with Ezzat Soliman, owner of the Showcase Theater, having released albums by classic Punk and Oi! bands like The Exploited, Vice Squad, Sham 69, Conflict, The Adicts and Abrasive Wheels among others. With help of Jay Lee from the band Resist and Exist, the band started organizations such as United Valley Punks, Orange County Peace Punks and Alternative Gathering Collective. Together, they held such social events as Food Not Bombs, helped open the Los Angeles Anarchist Center and supported the Big Mountain Indian Reservation.  History  Formed in 1989, the first Total Chaos line up consisted of vocalist Rob Chaos, guitarist Gary Doom, bassist Joe E. Bastard and drummer Gearbox. In 1991, the band recorded their first demo titled Punk Invasion, followed by the 7\\" EP Nightmares in 1992. In 1993, the band recorded their debut album We Are the Punx, We Are the Future. Shortly after Gary Doom left the band, being replaced by Ronald McMurder, a tour in Mexico with the Mexican band Yaps was booked, having most of the venues sold out. Epitaph Records decided to sign the band to release the 1994 album Pledge of Defiance. To support the release, a tour was booked with The Mighty Mighty Bosstones. After the end of the tour, a second album for Epitaph Records was recorded in 1995, Patriotic Shock, adding Germ as second guitarist. Once again, the band toured for the release, this time with Battalion of Saints. Due to the strong message against racism and socio-political subjects, the band faced racist and nationalist organizations at the shows and the ban of the album in Japan. In the summer of the same year, Total Chaos visited Europe for the first time, with a new lead guitarist, Shawn Smash, playing in Germany for the Chaos Days festival, well known for the often violent environment. In 1996, Rob Chaos, Joe E. Bastard and Shawn Smash recruited Suzy Homewrecker on drums to record a new album titled Anthems From the Alleyway. This album differs from the others because of the 70s punk rock influenced sound. By 1997, the band lost contact with Epitaph Records while recording demos for the upcoming album, mainly because of the drug rehab of label founder Brett Gurewitz and poor communication with the label president Andy Kalukin. For these reasons, the band decided to leave Epitaph Records. Total Chaos live in Mexico, 2007 By early 1998, Total Chaos disbanded, although by September the group reformed without Homewrecker, who was (according to the official Total Chaos website) stealing the band's T-shirts, selling them at a discounted price and keeping the profits herself. Total Chaos asked Traci Michaels to fill in for one show, which was the reunion show at the Showcase Theatre. They continued to search for drummers and found Danny Boy Virus. The band then signed with Cleopatra Records to release the In God We Kill in 1999 and the compilation Early Years 89-93 with the early demos and LPs. The band got back to touring with Blanks77 and in 2000 completed its first Japanese tour. Shortly after, the band recorded Punk Invasion, released on Reject Records in 2001, with Todd Trash playing bass and Danny Boy Virus on drums. In 2002, the band was invited to the Warped Tour, with bands like The Casualties, Pistol Grip, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Anti- Flag and Bad Religion among others. After the tour, original drummer Gearbox returned with the band, and with the new bassist Charlie, ex-member Life's Halt, the band released Freedom Kills with SOS Records, and toured with The Adicts, The Exploited and Conflict. On October 14, 2003, the band was scheduled to play in Montreal with The Exploited, but due to legal issues, both bands were retained at the U.S. border. One of the reasons was because The Exploited lied to the Canadian Customs, saying it was a road trip, and they were not a band, being caught when an employee showed a photo of Wattie on stage performing with the band. Total Chaos' entrance was denied due to the criminal records of some members, although Rob chaos stated: \\"It should be against the law to pry into someone's past and dig up something they'd done 15 years ago\\". After the cancellation of the show, some fans decided to cause riots and disorder, some cars and shops were damaged, as well as a few police officers injured and an undisclosed number of people were arrested. The events were widely covered by the media. .

He was one of three proprietors of the Rombout Patent, and father of pioneering Colonial businesswoman Catheryna Rombout Brett. Biography Frans Rombout was born on June 22 at 1631 in Hasselt (Belgium), the second son of Jan Rombout, who was a taxreceiver for the Archdeacon of Liege, and Johanna Haenen. Francis Rombout emigrated to New Amsterdam in 1653 aboard the ship Nieuw Amsterdam. He engaged in trade as a merchant, while yet a youth. In the year 1658, he enrolled himself among the burghers, or citizens, though he had been for several years previously a trader here. His trading operations as a merchant were tolerably extensive, though he did not rank among the wealthiest of the inhabitants. He was probably worth, as near as can be estimated, about ten thousand dollars, which was then, however, considered an independent fortune. Rombout bought his first stone house at Nieuw-Amsterdam, in the Heerestraat, now Broadway in Manhattan. Rombout held several offices of trust among his fellow-citizens. In 1673, 1674, 1676, 1678, 1686, he was an Alderman. Afterward, in 1687, the city having been divided into wards, he was returned as Alderman of the West Ward. he afterward held the office of Justice of the Peace, until his death. His political principles were of a liberal character, and his manners and address grave and dignified. Rombout's dwelling was on Broadway, west side, near Rector street, extending to the North river shore. it embraced a large garden and an orchard. At the time of his mayoralty, the city contained about 3,500 inhabitants.Sketches of the Mayors of New York Rombouts Avenue in the Bronx is named for him. On May 31, 1665, Rombout married Aeltie Wessels in the Reformed Dutch Church of New Amsterdam. She died sometime prior to August 5, 1675, when he then married Anna Elizabeth Masschop. Widowed a second time, he married, on September 8, 1683, Helena Teller Bogardus Van Bael. It was the third marriage for both of them. Helena Teller was born about 1645, the daughter of William and Margaret Doncheson Teller of Schenectady.\\"William Teller, of Holland, founder of the Teller family in America, was born in 1620, died in 1701. He arrived at New Netherlands in 1639, and in the same year was sent by Governor Kieft to Fort Orange, now Albany, and subsequently was quartermaster at the fort. He lived in Albany from 1639 until 1692, when he returned to New York where he was a merchant. He was one of the five patentees of the town of Schenectady in 1684; although he never lived there. The Teller family is prominent in the history of Albany and Schenectady counties, where they had large interests. William Teller married (first) Margaret Donchensen, and had six children; (second) Maria Varleth, and had three additional children.\\" Hudson-Mohawk Genealogical and Family Memoirs: Teller, Schenectady Digital History Archive Helena had seven children from her previous marriages, and from this marriage, another three were born. She and Rombout had two boys and a girl. The boys died young but the girl, Catharyna, born on 5 September 1687, survived. Catharyna later married British Royal Navy lieutenant Roger Brett. The Rombout Patent The Hudson River shore of the Rombout Patent in the town of Wappinger, New York The Rombout Patent was a legal instrument issued by King James II of England in 1685 sanctioning the right of Francis Rombouts and his partners Gulian Verplanck and Jacobus Kip to own some of land they had purchased from Native Americans. The Patent included most of what is today's southern Dutchess County, New York. Rombout, had gone into the fur-trading business with Verplanck. A license for the pair to purchase an 85,000 acres tract of the Wappinger people land was granted by Governor Thomas Dongan, February 8, 1682.The History of Putnam County, New York. Frank Hasbrouck, editor, 1909 They were joined in 1683 by Stephanus Van Cortlandt, the first native-born mayor of New York City and patroon of Van Cortlandt Manor in Westchester County, who offered to put up one-third of the money in return for a one-third interest in the parcel. Purchase was completed on August 8, 1683, the $1,250 or so price paid in guns, shot, powder, blankets, wampum, alcohol, cloth and other goods. Before a patent could be issued to the trio, however, Verplanck died, and his widow Henrica married Jacobus Kip. The Rombout Patent was finally granted in 1685 to Verplanck, Rombout, and Stephanus Van Cortlandt on October 17, 1685, with the Verplanck interest passing down through the Kip line.Genealogies of the State of New York: A Record of the Achievements, Volume 2, p. 744 =Maps= See a period map of the Patent here at the Mount Julian Historical Site.

Throughout its existence the brigade was assigned to the 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division and was composed almost entirely of Territorial battalions from the Royal Welch Fusiliers. Formation The North Wales Brigade (as it was originally known) was created in 1908 under the Haldane Reforms when the Volunteer Force and the Yeomanry were merged to create the Territorial Force and was composed of the 4th (Denbighshire), 5th (Flintshire), 6th (Carnarvonfonshire and Anglesey) and 7th (Merioneth and Montgomery) Volunteer battalions of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers. The brigade was assigned to the Welsh Division, one of fourteen divisions of the peacetime Territorial Force. As the name suggests, the brigade recruited primarily from North Wales. First World War The Welsh Division was mobilised on 5 August 1914, the day after Britain declared war on Germany, which officially began the Great War. According to the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 soldiers of the Territorial Force were only able to serve overseas with their permission and so, when asked, a large majority of the men volunteered for overseas service. Throughout 1915 all divisions of the Territorial Force were given numbers and so, on 13 May 1915, the division was numbered as the 53rd (Welsh) Division and all the brigades of the division were also numbered, the North Wales Brigade becoming the 158th (1/1st North Wales) Brigade. The battalions were also redesignated, becoming, for example, '1/5th RWF', to distinguish them from their 2nd Line duplicates which were currently being formed in 203rd (2/1st North Wales) Brigade, of the 68th (2nd Welsh) Division, which consisted mainly of the men who, when asked at the outbreak of the war, did not wish to serve overseas, together with the many recruits and thousands of men volunteering. The brigade fought with the 53rd (Welsh) Division throughout the First World War in the Middle Eastern theatre from mid-1915 until the end of the war in 1918. In its first action the brigade was involved in the disastrous Gallipoli Campaign where it landed in August 1915. After temporarily serving under command of the 2nd Mounted Division, between 31 October and 28 November, the brigade, together with the rest of 53rd Division, was evacuated form Gallipoli to Egypt in December 1915 and continued serving in the Middle Eastern theatre in Sinai and Palestine. The brigade took part in the Battle of Romani in August 1916, the Battle of El Buggar Ridge in October 1917 and the Action of Tell 'Asur in March 1918, where it fought off several counter-attacks by the Ottoman forces. Throughout mid-1918, most of the British battalions of the brigade were posted to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) serving in the trenches of the Western Front, after the German Army launched its huge Spring Offensive, which saw huge territorial gains for the Germans. As a result, the British battalions were replaced by Indian Army battalions. This occurred in most British divisions serving in the Middle East. =Order of Battle, First World War= The brigade commanded the following units in the First World War: * 1/4th (Denbighshire) Battalion, Royal Welsh Fusiliers (left on 6 November 1914 for 3rd Brigade, 1st Division on the Western Front) * 1/5th (Flintshire) Battalion, Royal Welsh Fusiliers (until 2 August 1918) * 1/6th (Carnarvonshire and Anglesey) Battalion, Royal Welsh Fusiliers (until 2 August 1918) * 1/7th (Merioneth and Montgomery) Battalion, Royal Welsh Fusiliers (left 24 June 1918 for 160th (Welsh Border) Brigade) * 1/1st Battalion, Herefordshire Regiment (joined on 24 April 1915 from 160th (Welsh Border) Brigade, left 1 June 1918 for 102nd Brigade, 34th Division on the Western Front) * 5th/6th Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers (from 3 August 1918) * 158th Machine Gun Company, Machine Gun Corps (formed 26 April 1916, moved to 53rd Battalion, Machine Gun Corps 25 April 1918) * 158th Trench Mortar Battery (formed 22 July 1917) * 4th Battalion, 11th Gurkha Rifles (newly formed on 25 April 1918 and joined on 4 June 1918) * 3rd Battalion, 153rd Rifles (newly formed on 25 April 1918 and joined on 10 June 1918) * 3rd Battalion, 154th Infantry (joined from Mesopotamia on 3 August 1918) Between the wars The division and brigade, along with the rest of the Territorial Force, was disbanded after the war but started to reform in 1920, and was later renamed the Territorial Army. The division was reformed as the 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division and the brigade was itself reformed and renamed as the 158th (Royal Welch) Infantry Brigade, with its headquarters at Wrexham. The brigade again consisted of four battalions of the Royal Welch Fusiliers and this remained the order of battle of the brigade for most of the inter-war period. In 1938 a reorganisation of the Territorial Army's infantry divisions saw them reduced from twelve to nine infantry battalions. As a direct consequence of this, the 5th (Flintshire) Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers was chosen to be converted into another role, being transferred to the Royal Artillery and converted and redesignated to become the 60th (Royal Welch Fusiliers) Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery and acted as the anti-tank regiment for the 53rd Division until December 1939 when it transferred to the 1st Armoured Division. Second World War The Territorial Army, and 53rd Division, was mobilised in late August/early September 1939, due to the situation in Europe becoming increasingly worse. The German Army invaded Poland on 1 September 1939 and Britain and France declared war on Germany two days later, officially beginning the Second World War. Over a month later, in October the brigade, as in the First World War consisted of three battalions of the Royal Welch Fusiliers, the 4th, 6th and 7th. The 158th Brigade the first element of the 53rd Division to be sent to Northern Ireland, followed in December by the 160th Brigade and later 159th Brigade in April 1940. The brigade would remain there until November 1941, training hard with the rest of the division. After the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was evacuated from Dunkirk in late May/early June, the brigade, with the division, moved to Ulster to counter a possible German invasion there and the garrison was strengthened by the arrival of the 61st Infantry Division and, in March 1941, the 5th Infantry Division, a Regular Army formation that had seen service in France with the BEF in 1940. In November 1941 the division was sent back to the mainland again, briefly serving in Wales before transferring to Kent, coming under command of XII Corps and serving alongside 43rd (Wessex) and 46th Infantry Divisions. The corps was commanded by Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery.

The brigade again fought from June 1944 to May 1945 on the Western Front in Normandy, Falaise, the Ardennes and the Reichswald before finally invading Germany itself. =Order of battle= The 158th Infantry Brigade was constituted as follows during the war: * 4th (Denbighshire) Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers (left 3 August 1944) * 6th (Caernarvonshire and Anglesey) Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers (left 3 August 1944) * 7th (Merionethshire & Montgomeryshire) Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers (left 27 April 1945, rejoined 14 June 1945) * 1/5th Battalion, Welch Regiment (from 4 August 1944) * 1st Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment (from 4 August 1944) * 2nd Battalion, South Wales Borderers (from 27 April 1945) =Commanders= The following officers commanded 158th Brigade during the war: * Brigadier E.O.

These incidents occurred in the midst of a disarmament process, according to which a portion of the New Forces fighters were to be integrated into the army, while the majority were to be given work on projects. The disarmament process was to be followed by a presidential election and a parliamentary election. Disorder in Bouak√© By late May, with the disarmament process continuing, 2,568 New Forces soldiers had been grouped in camps. As part of the process, each of the former rebels were planned to each receive 90,000 CFA francs per month for three months; the first of these monthly payments occurred in May.\\"C√¥te d'Ivoire: nouvelle manifestation d'ex-rebelles dans leur fief √† Bouak√©\\", AFP (L'Autre Quotidien, Cotonou, allAfrica.com), June 19, 2008 .

Prime Minister Guillaume Soro, who also leads the New Forces, sent a financial team on June 17 to make the payments. Although payments began to be made early on June 18, another violent protest took place on the same day; New Forces soldiers reportedly fired into the air, attacked civilians, seized vehicles, set up barricades, and looted shops. By evening on June 18, Bouak√© was calm again, as security was increased through joint patrols of the New Forces and UN peacekeepers. Unrest in Vavoua and Seguela New Forces fighters loyal to Zacharia Kon√©, a New Forces commander who was dismissed from his command in May 2008 for indiscipline, reportedly mutinied in Vavoua and Seguela on June 28. The unrest was said to have begun in Vavoua and then spread to Seguela. Three civilians were reportedly killed, along with one of the fighters involved in the unrest; another of the fighters was reportedly wounded. The unrest reportedly ended on the same day; according to official sources, the soldiers surrendered on the condition that they would be protected by French peacekeeping forces.\\"Former ICoast rebels in short- lived mutiny\\" , AFP, June 28, 2008. New Forces officials differed on whether this unrest was caused by an issue with the disarmament payments or whether it was a result of Kon√©'s dismissal; the soldiers involved in the unrest said that they wanted payment of the disarmament money, although Kon√©'s dismissal also appeared to be a factor.\\"Ivory Coast: talks with rebel soldiers break up\\", AFP, July 2, 2008. An aide to Soro, Alain Lobognon, said on June 29 that Soro had forbidden the use of force in dealing with the unrest. Lobognon also disputed the widespread characterization of the unrest as a mutiny and said that the soldiers were under the protection of UN and French peacekeepers. Kon√©'s replacement as commander of the Seguela region, Issiaka Ouattara, said that he was trying to maintain calm and was not using force, in accordance with Soro's orders. On the same day, one of the rebellious soldiers in Vavoua told Agence France-Presse that they had not surrendered in either town, that their force was several hundred strong and was in control of Vavoua, and that they were holding their commanders hostage.\\"Ivory Coast PM rules out force against rebel soldiers\\", AFP, June 29, 2008.

Kennedy and George McGovern. As a historian, he pioneered the interdisciplinary application of social science techniques to the study of urban history and helped make cities an important academic subject. His first book The Urban Frontier (1959) was a challenge to Frederick Jackson Turner's Frontier thesis, asserting that the catalysts for western expansion were the Western cities like Pittsburgh, Louisville, and Cincinnati, not the pioneer farmers. Life Wade was born in Des Moines but grew up in Winnetka, Illinois, a wealthy suburb of Chicago, where his father practiced law. He attended New Trier High School there, where he played championship-level tennis. Wade earned bachelor's and master's degrees in history at the University of Rochester and also competed in basketball, track and field and baseball. After receiving his doctorate at Harvard University in 1956, Wade taught at Rochester and at Washington University in St. Louis before moving to the University of Chicago in 1963. In 1971 Wade was named a distinguished professor of history at CUNY's Graduate Center. In 1991 Wade was appointed chairman of New York State's Commission on Libraries by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. Wade was a co-founder and the first president of the Urban History Association. \\"He started a movement,\\" said his former student Kenneth T. Jackson. \\"There are hundreds of books on cities now, and in a sense he is their grandfather. The only reason I took urban history was because of him; I had never heard of such a thing.\\" Wade was a close friend of Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., with whom he shared an office at the Graduate Center. He moved easily in the higher circles of Democratic Party politics. In 1974-1975 Wade was the Harold Vyvyan Harmsworth Professor of American History at Oxford University. His marriages to Louise Carroll Wade of Eugene, Oregon, and Cynthia Hyla Whittaker of Manhattan, New York ended in divorce. He was survived by his wife, the former Liane Wood-Thomas. He died at his home in Roosevelt Island in Manhattan, New York. Views In The Urban Frontier, Wade summarized the claims that scholars had made for the importance of the city in American history. The cities were the focal points for the growth of the West, especially those along the Ohio River and Mississippi River. The cities, especially Boston were the seedbeds of the American Revolution. The rivalry between cities, such as between Baltimore and Philadelphia, or between Chicago and St. Louis, stimulated economic innovations and growth, especially regarding the railroads. The failure of the South to develop an urban infrastructure significantly weakened it during the American Civil War, especially after its border cities of Baltimore, Washington, Louisville, and St. Louis refused to join the Confederacy. The cities were fonts of innovation in democracy, especially in terms of building powerful political organizations and machines; they were also the main base for reformers of what those machines built, becoming the home base for important immigrant groups, especially the Irish and the Jews. Cities were the strongholds of labor unions in the 19th and 20th centuries (although no longer true in the 21st century). See Richard Wade, \\"The City in History: Some American Perspectives,\\" in Werner Z. Hirsch, ed., Urban Life and Form (1963) pp. 59‚Äì77. In \\"Slavery in the Cities\\" Wade undermined a common understanding that slavery is a purely agrarian labor system emphasizing the importance of the South‚Äôs commercial cities.

Englishwoman Vera Blackwell first published this translation in 1967. In 2006, American translator Paul Wilson published a new translation, titled The Memo at Havel's request. http://www.theater61press.com/essays/memo-essay-havel.html Both plays are a black comedy that parody bureaucracy and conformity. Havel wrote Vyrozumƒõn√≠ prior to the Prague Spring of 1968 as an ironic satire dissenting communist rule. Despite its veiled themes, the play was approved by government censors and published. The Memorandum centers on the introduction of a new language, \\"Ptydepe\\", in an unnamed organization, that is meant to make work more efficient despite having the opposite effect. http://www.theater61press.com/books-2/the-havel-collection/the-memo.html Sam Walters considers The Memorandum to be Havel‚Äôs masterpiece. Plot Josef Gross (Andrew Gross in the Wilson translation), a director of an unnamed organization, receives a memorandum written in Ptydepe, a constructed language, about an audit. He finds out that Ptydepe was created to get rid of similarities between words, such as fox and ox, and emotional connotations. He tries to get someone to translate the memorandum for him, and gradually becomes opposed to the use of Ptydepe. Gross finally finds a reluctant secretary named Maria (Alice in the Wilson translation) who explains that, while she can translate the memorandum, she does not yet have a permit to do so. The next day, his deputy Jan Ballas (Max Balas in the Wilson translation) takes over Gross's job. Gross becomes a \\"staff watcher\\", someone who spies on the workers of the unnamed organization. Meanwhile, Maria gets fired for translating Gross's memorandum. The last few Ptydepe learners in the organization give up learning. After a while, Ballas gives his job back to Gross. Ptydepe is replaced with another language, Chorukor, one with very extreme similarities between words so as to make learning it easier, but finally it is decided to get back to the mother language. The play ends up with most of the characters going to lunch. Characters *Josef Gross (Andrew Gross) *Jan Ballas (Max Balas) *Pillar (Victor Kubs) *Maria (Alice) *Hana *Helena (Talaura) *Stroll (Ken Masat) *Savant (Sid Maher) *George (Josh) *Thumb (Ms. Kalous) *Lear (J. V. Brown) *Column Invented languages The play's two fictional artificial languages, Ptydepe and Chorukor, are at the heart of the play's satire. =Ptydepe= According to the characters of the play, Ptydepe was constructed along strictly scientific lines, with none of the messiness and ambiguity of natural languages. In order to be able to express precisely all the subtle and easily misunderstood nuances of natural language, Ptydepe has a large, non-expandable vocabulary. Another problem of natural language that Ptydepe was intended to eliminate is the frequent similarity of unrelated words, or homonyms. To entirely avoid the possibilities for confusion that arise with homonyms and similar unrelated words, Ptydepe was created according to the postulate that all words must be formed from the least probable combinations of letters. Specifically, it makes use of the so-called \\"sixty percent dissimilarity\\" rule; which states that any Ptydepe word must differ by at least sixty percent of its letters from any other word consisting of the same number of letters. This led to the necessity of creating some very long words. The inevitable problem of pronounceability is solved by breaking very long words up into smaller clusters of letters called \\"subwords\\", which nonetheless have no meaning outside of the word they belong to and are not interchangeable. Length of words, like everything else in Ptydepe, is determined scientifically. The vocabulary of Ptydepe uses entropy encoding: shorter words have more common meanings. Therefore, the shortest word in Ptydepe, gh, corresponds to what is so far known to be the most general term in natural language, whatever. (The longest word in Ptydepe, which contains 319 letters, is the word for \\"wombat\\" in an English translation. However in the Czech original it is a name for a nonexistent member of the genus Apus, ror√Ωs ≈ô√≠ƒçn√≠.V√°clav Havel. Hry. Praha: Lidov√© noviny, 1992. 56.) Theoretically an even shorter word than gh exists in Ptydepe, namely f, but it has no meaning assigned and is held in reserve in case a more general term than \\"whatever\\" is discovered. Havel's younger brother, computer scientist Ivan M. Havel, helped in its formulation. In Czech, the word \\"Ptydepe\\" has been used to mean incomprehensible bureaucratic jargon, or newspeak intending to hide its true meaning.

The declared goal for this device was to convince non-computer-savvy people that computers are not impossibly hard to use and can be bought and used like normal home appliances. For this reason, it was intentionally designed to resemble a videocassette recorder more than a computer and it was equipped with two SCART sockets (to connect it to a TV set), a TV-like remote control and a slot that would host a satellite decoder card.

Plot At Nazi headquarters in occupied Holland, Major Zellfritz (Allyn Joslyn) assigned to find a downed British pilot, becomes sidetracked by Anita Woverman (Joan Bennett). He demands that the Wovermans billet him and his men at her house. Upstairs, the butler, Jan (Erskine Sanford), is hiding the escaped pilot, Christopher Reynolds (Franchot Tone). When a group of stormtroopers arrives, Mrs. Woverman learns of Reynolds' presence, but claims he is her son Hendrik. She runs a home for spinsters in the area while her husband is institutionalized as mad. Reynolds decides to protect Anita from Zellfritz's amorous advances. An arrangement to meet a contact at the Savoy Caf√© requires Reynolds to ask Anita to cover for him. At the caf√©, Reynolds contacts Gustav (William Edmunds), a waiter, who delivers a message in a sandwich. A suspicious Nazi officer details several soldiers to follow him. Reynolds slips the document to Anita. Zellfritz, still trying to romance Anita, brags about his relative who is \\"high up\\" in the U-boat fleet. Still being carefully watched, Reynolds meets another stranger on the street. Keith (Roger Clark), the new contact, provides him with the identity papers of a beer truck driver. An Allied agent with a shortwave radio is operating in the area, and Reynolds arranges to meet him later that night. At home, Anita is still dealing with Zellfritz, but finds Reynolds waiting for her. She tells him that the major's relative will complete his mission in Eselmunder at a submarine fleet there. At the agent's house several Gestapo officers have been arrested the agent, Reynolds escapes and goes back to Anita's house. Anita says the major drops propaganda leaflets nightly over England. The spinsters offer their help in transcribing the location of the submarine site onto the pamphlets. That night, as Anita entertains Zellfritz in her room, the spinsters alter the pamphlets, but are interrupted by Hendrik (Hans Conried), Anita's real husband, at the door. Hendrik is on the run and asks Reynolds for help in evading the Nazis. Reynolds gives Hendrik his forged identification card. After the pamphlets are safely stuffed back into the major's bag, Reynolds bursts into Anita's room, claiming that the Gestapo are after him. Zellfritz thinking he is helping Anita's son, agrees to help him escape, but first he has a mission at the airport. Reynolds is arrested for desecrating a poster of Hitler. At the court, the spinsters set off an air raid alarm and, in the chaos, Reynolds spies the major's car. After knocking Zellfritz unconscious, Reynolds puts on the major's uniform and speeds away to a waiting aircraft with the pamphlets in hand. Then Anita, Reynolds and her friend, the Countess Oldenburg, fly away to freedom, leaving the major behind, dressed only in his underwear.

But certainly the sort of laughter which Columbia's \\"The Wife Takes a Flyer\\" limply woos is a token neither of wit nor a healthy respect for the foe. So, if you find the picture un-amusing, do not fear for the nation's state.

History Public transport arrived in the Streu Valley in 1838, but only a few of the local inhabitants could afford the luxury of travelling by post coach. Ostheim, an enclave of the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach pressed for a railway link as early as 1853. But it was only in 1866 that Bavaria decided to extend the railway network into the remote and poorly served Rh√∂n mountains in the north of the state. In 1871 the line from Schweinfurt to Bad Kissingen was opened, but it was another 18 years before the Lokalbahn AG was initially tasked with building a line from Mellrichstadt to Ostheim, only for it to be cancelled. Finally, in 1897, work began, and the line was completed on 20 December 1898. The early years were dominated by goods transportation for agriculture, forestry and emerging local industries. Increasing tourist traffic also generated business for the line and surrounding hostelries. Until 1911, management of the line was based at Fladungen; from that time it transferred to Mellrichstadt. South of Ostheim the sawmill Nix & Zinn still had to load its products at the line; later an industrial siding was built. From the factory site to the loading ramp a narrow-gauge industrial line handled the movement of goods, mainly railway sleepers. During the First World War, services had to be cut to two pairs of trains daily and the shortage of coal meant that operations even had to be ceased for a while at the end of the war, restarting in January 1920. In 1927 the route was raised 7 metres higher by Stockheim station in order to cross the state road. Soon after the opening of a basalt works in Fladungen, the capacity of the terminus there proved inadequate and significant expansion was needed. The station tracks were extended to the north via an embankment. A ramp was erected on the station approach where building material for the new High Rh√∂n Road (Hochrh√∂nstrasse) was transshipped. Passenger services were withdrawn in 1976 and the last goods train ran in 1987 when the Streu Valley line was finally closed by the Deutsche Bundesbahn.  Museum Railway  In 1996 the branch was opened again as far as Ostheim as a museum railway operating the so-called Little Rh√∂n Train (Rh√∂n-Z√ºgle). In 2000, the entire route to Fladungen was opened again. The museum's jewel in the crown is its restored Bavarian GtL 4/4 steam engine, number 98 886, which is on loan from the town of Schweinfurt. The museum railway is part of the Franconian Open Air Museum (Fr√§nkisches Freilandmuseum) and the railway is operated by the Lower Main Railway Friends (Eisenbahnfreunden Untermain).264 Image:Bavarian locomotive GtL 4-4 98_886_006.jpg98 886 at Stockheim in August 2006 Image:Bavarian locomotive GtL 4-4 98 886 008.jpg98 886 heading for Ostheim Image:Bavarian Class GtL 4-4 locomotive 98_886_001.jpg98 886 at Heufurt level crossing heading down the valley Image:Bavarian Class GtL 4-4 Locomotive 98_886_002.jpg98 886 by Nordheim heading down the valley Sources * German Wikipedia article at Bahnstrecke Mellrichstadt‚ÄìFladungen * Lokalbahn von Mellrichstadt nach Fladungen See also * History of rail transport in Germany * Royal Bavarian State Railways * Deutsche Reichsbahn * Deutsche Bundesbahn ReferencesLiterature * Fr√§nkische Nebenbahnen - Mittel- und Unterfranken / W.

Reviewing Timothy Murphy's second collection in Contemporary Poetry Review in 2002, Paul Lake observed that \\"What Virgil was to the Italian peninsula and Homer to the Greek Mediterranean, Murphy is to the swatch of plains stretching from the Upper Midwest to the Rockies like a grassy inland sea.\\" Life Murphy was the son of Vincent and Katherine Bye Murphy. He was raised in Moorhead, Minnesota. Murphy was admitted to Yale University as an undergraduate. He was mentored there by Robert Penn Warren, the renowned poet and novelist. In 1972, he graduated with a B.A. degree and was designated Scholar of the House in Poetry. However, Warren declined to recommend Murphy for an academic position. Warren urged him instead to return to the \\"rich soil\\" of his rural roots. Murphy returned to Minnesota, where he joined his father in an insurance and estate planning business. He subsequently became involved in several farming and manufacturing enterprises in North Dakota. Waywiser Press published Murphy's second collection of poetry. In this webpage they include otherwise unpublished quotations from Dick Davis, Michael Donaghy, and Richard Wilbur, as well as excerpts from published reviews. Poetry Murphy published his first collection of poetry, The Deed of Gift, in 1998; the collection represents all of Murphy's work as a poet through about 1996. In a contemporary review of the volume, Gerry Cambridge summarized Murphy's accomplishment: \\"There are outstanding poems here, including 'Harvest of Sorrows', 'Sunset at the Getty', and 'The Quarrel', as well as a great number of very likeable, individual, and tautly-made pieces. It would be hard to confuse Murphy with any other contemporary poet. No one else writing poetry in English sounds quite like him.\\" Gerry Cambridge founded the Scottish literary journal The Dark Horse. As poet Dick Davis has noted, this distinctive style owes much to Murphy's use of traditional meter and rhyme, unusual among poets today: \\"His poems are wholly his own, and yet the voice in them lives in and through his mastery of traditional metre, which is so thorough as to seem indivisible from the poems' sensibility and meaning.\\" This focus on rhyme and meter is exemplified in the following excerpt from \\"Harvest of Sorrows\\": In a 2001 interview, Murphy cited C.P. Cavafy and Homer as influences, noting that they, like himself, were gay. In 2011, The Dakota Institute published two collections of Murphy's poetry, Mortal Stakes and Faint Thunder and Hunter's Log. Murphy joked in an interview that year that \\"I've got more inventory than Ford Motor Co.\\" After 2011, Murphy's poetry has been published by The North Dakota State University Press. Devotions (2017) is a substantial (160-page) collection that gathers poems from his return to the Catholic Church after 2005. Dana Gioia concludes his introduction: \\"These are genuine poems rooted in a passionate encounter with the divine. I predict they will find many devoted readers.\\" In 2019, Hunter's Log: Volumes II & III appeared posthumously.

Players first drop their three pieces onto the board, and then move them to create a 3 in-a-row which wins the game. It is similar to games like Tapatan, Achi, Nine Holes, Shisima, and Tant Fant. However, what makes this game unique is that pieces can jump over each other (without capture) which adds an extra dimension in the maneuverability of the pieces.

Goal  To be first to create a 3 in-a-row with one's pieces  Equipment  The board is an isosceles triangle with one line across its breadth, and another line running down the length of the board down its central axis. This creates for seven intersection points of which the pieces can be played upon. Tsoro Each player has 3 pieces. One plays the black pieces, and the other player plays the white pieces.  Game Play and Rules  1\\\\. The board is empty in the beginning. Players decide what color pieces to play, and who starts first. 2\\\\. Each player drops one piece per turn on any vacant point on the board. Players alternate their turns. Pieces cannot be moved until all six pieces have been dropped. Observe that after all pieces have been dropped, there is only one vacant point on the board. 3\\\\. A piece can be moved one of two ways: a) A piece can move one space per turn onto a vacant point following the pattern on the board, or b) a piece can jump over another piece (friend or foe) adjacent to it, and land on a vacant point on the other side; the jump must be in a straight line and follow the pattern on the board. There are no captures in this game. 4\\\\. The game can last a very long time, and if no one is still able to create the 3 in-a-row, the players can agree to a draw.

The studio operated for over twenty-five years, and had artists, musicians, and producers from all over the world record and produce their music there. The studio was established in 1975 by a lighting technician named Frank Andrews, who had toured across the UK with bands such as Queen, ABBA, and the Rolling Stones. Andrews returned home from tour to discover his parents had moved to a different place, which is where Ridge Farm Studio was born. He started the studio with his brother, Billy, as a quiet place for bands to rehearse. Ridge Farm Studio did well enough that Andrews was eventually able to buy the property from his parents. It remained a popular location well into the 1990s, after the surge of Britpop. However, bookings eventually dwindled. Joe Jackson was the last person to record there in 2002. It was located in the village of Rusper, England near the Surrey and Sussex border. The oldest part of the building, originally a mediaeval farmhouse, and what was to become Ridge Farm Studio was built in the mid-17th century and additions to the building were added over the centuries. The studio was surrounded by of land that included gardens, orchards, meadows and woodland.

He also served as Rajadnya in the court of Emperor Chhatrapati Shahu and as Peshwa (Prime Minister) to the court of Chhatrapati Sambhaji II of Kolhapur.  Early life and career  Chimnaji Damodar was born in a Karhade Brahmin family. The year of his birth is not known, however, it must have been around 1675. He was the Sardar of Parola located in the Khandesh region of Maharashtra. During the regime of Chhatrapati Rajaram, Ramchandra Pant Amatya encouraged the independent Maratha warriors to invade Mughal areas with intention to distract Mughal army concentrated in Maharashtra under the leadership of Aurangzeb. Chimnaji Damodar, along with Nemaji Shinde, happened to be the first to successfully respond to this strategy by crossing the boundary of Maharashtra and entering into Malwa. His troops attacked Mughal subjects in Central and Northern parts of India and looted enormous money and treasure.  Later life  In 1707, when Shahu was released by Mughals, Chimnaji Damodar left Tarabai and joined Shahu. He contributed a lot in Shahu‚Äôs victory against Tarabai at Khed as a result of which Shahu appointed him as Mutalik (Deputy Prime Minister). Subsequently, he was appointed to the prestigious post of Rajadnya (Deputy to the Crown). In 1718-1719, he accompanied Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath in his expedition to Delhi. In 1720, after Balaji Vishwanath‚Äôs death, Bajirao became the new Peshwa over objections raised by Damodar that Bajirao lacked the experience required for such a responsible post. As a result, he withdrew himself from Emperor Shahu‚Äôs court. In 1727, Chhatrapati Sambhaji II appointed him as Peshwa of Kolhapur state. In 1731, he joined hands with Dabhade and fought with Bajirao at Dabhai but lost. However, since then his relations with Bajirao went on improving till the end of his life. He had one son named Balwantrao Damodar.

It was formed by a Japanese teacher, Michio Koyama, in 1994 with the aim of helping street children get an education and a better standard of living. History Mr Michio Koyama visited Vietnam in 1992 where he first encountered the street children who were (and still are) rife on the streets of Ho Chi Minh City and other places across the country. One year later he left Tokyo and moved to Hu·∫ø, taking on a job at the university teaching English. Using the money he earned, he had a house built which was used to shelter children who needed somewhere to stay. The house opened for use in 1994, and as of 2004 over 300 children had passed through. They received shelter, food, schooling and guidance. The aim is to make any children who join the project self-sufficient by the time they are 18 years of age. If any chose to continue into further education / university then exceptions can be made to help them with funding. JASS predominantly helps children in the Hu·∫ø Province. Mr Koyama was the first Japanese person to be made a citizen of Hu·∫ø. Fundraising Most funds come from Japanese sources. Private individual donations and corporate sponsorship make up the bulk of these with government grants also helping. A restaurant, called simply Japanese Restaurant, is located at 34 √ê Tran Cao Van. Staff are partially made up of trainees and \\"graduates\\" from JASS.

The Regiment provides field artillery support to the 1st Brigade based in Darwin. It is currently equipped with 155mm M777 Howitzers. The 8th Medium Regiment, known in the 1950s as the 19th Composite Regiment, was created in February 1968 to provide a united administrative command of several independent artillery units in the Holsworthy Barracks area and had the primary role of providing support to the School of Artillery. The 12th Field Regiment had been reformed at Holsworthy in April 1966, and its elements served in Vietnam in 1968 and 1971. Before relocating to Darwin, the regiment was stationed in Townsville (Queensland) and Ingleburn (New South Wales). The three of the regiments current Gun batteries reflect their formation in Egypt as part of the First Australian Imperial Force 21st Field Artillery (Howitzer) Brigade, which used howitzers. The 101 and 103 Batteries, including the 102 Battery, served in France, also as part of the 1st Division. History=101st Battery= The 101st Medium Battery was originally formed as the 101st Howitzer Battery on 8 March 1916, at Tel-el-Kebir, from the members of the 1st Field Artillery Brigade, which formation served at Gallipoli. Although disbanded after the war, in the early 1920s, the Battery was reformed as a militia unit in the Newcastle area, but in 1946 it was again disbanded. In 1957, it was established again as the 101st Field Battery, at the Holsworthy Barracks, as part of the 1st Field Regiment (RAAC). It served in Malaya (1959/61), and was deployed twice to South Vietnam (1966‚Äì67 and 1969‚Äì70). It relocated to Wacol in 1970 before moving again to Enoggera in 1982 to rejoin the 1st Field Regiment. =102nd Battery= The 102nd Field Battery was formed in 1957 at Holsworthy Barracks, Sydney, as part of the 1st Field Regiment. The battery served during the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation between May and August 1965. While in Malaysia, the battery provided fire support during the Kesang River incursion by Indonesian forces. While serving in North Borneo, equipped with L5 Pack Howitzers, the battery provided defensive support to the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, as well as Ghurkha, and British Battalions undertaking operations; it also fire support for secret Claret operations in Indonesian territory. On 18 April 1966, the battery was transferred to the 12th Field Regiment with the 104th Field Battery. Arriving in Vietnam as part of Australia's commitment to the Vietnam War in March 1968, replacing the 106th Field Battery and was equipped with the 105mm M2A2 Howitzer. On the night of 12 May 1968, while at Fire Support Base Coral, a M2A2 howitzer was captured by North Vietnamese troops who temporarily overran part of the base; however, the gun was recaptured shortly afterwards. The 102nd Field Battery was replaced in February 1969, and returned to Australia. During its tour of duty, the battery had been positioned at 30 different Fire Support Bases, fired 60,000 rounds and received the following decorations: 1 MM, 2 MID, 1 MBE and 1 BEM. The battery became part of the 8th/12th Medium Regiment in November 1973 and in 1983, after being re-equipped with the M198 155mm howitzer, was redesignated 102nd Medium Battery before being disbanded in 1987. =103rd Battery= The immediate predecessor of the first Australian Battery to be numbered \\"103\\", the 103rd (Howitzer) Battery AIF (3rd (Army) Field Brigade) was the 26th Indian (Jacob's) Mountain Battery,First World War British Artillery Unit which was present at ANZAC Cove during the Battle of Gallipoli. On 6 March 1916, the Battery was created as part of the Australian Army contingent before departing for France as part of the 12th Howitzer Brigade. The 103rd Field Battery (Howitzer) was reformed after the First World War as part of the Citizen Military Forces from 1920 to 1941 stationed at Victoria Barracks, Paddington, moving to Guilford, Western Australia in 1921. Before the Second World War, the Battery was absorbed into the Field Batteries of the 3rd Field Regiment, and did not see service as a unit. The battery was reformed as the 103rd Anti- Aircraft Battery from 1954 to 1957; it was stationed at Middle Head Barracks, Sydney, as part of 1 Field Regiment. During 1960 to 1967, it changed designation again to the 103rd Field Battery, as part of the new Regular 4th Field Regiment stationed at Wacol, Brisbane. During the deployment of the Australian Army to Malaysia, the Battery was part of the Far Eastern Strategic Reserve stationed at Camp Terendak, Malacca, returning to Australia to become a part of the 1st Field Regiment at Kokoda Barracks, Holsworthy. It was again deployed, this time to South Vietnam, with the new light L5 105 mm howitzers in May 1966 at the Nui Dat Task Force base, from which it contributed significantly to the outcome of the Battle of Long Tan. During its first tour in Vietnam, the Battery fired 28,468 rounds in support of allied troops. On 19 June 1967, it became the 103rd Independent Medium Battery stationed at Gallipoli Barracks, Holsworthy, supporting the School of Artillery, providing gun salutes, and conducting some limited trials. However, this non-combat role ended on 16 April 1968 when the battery joined the 19th Composite Regiment (RAAC), located at Kokoda Barracks. On 4 August 1969, the 19th Composite Regiment was renamed as the 8th Medium Regiment. During the Vietnam War, the 104th Field Battery also served with the 12th Field Regiment ‚Äì to which the 161st Field Battery RNZA was also attached. =Post Vietnam= M198 of 101 Medium Battery, 8/12 Medium Regiment in 2001. The Regiment was a creation of the reorganisation of the Australian Army as a result of the Vietnam War experience. During the mid-1970s, the 8th/12th Medium Regiment included: 8/12 Regiment Australian Artillery Association :Headquarters Battery :\\"A\\" Field Battery :103 Medium Battery :102 Field Battery (disbanded in 1987) :131 Divisional Locating Battery :Light Aid Detachment (LAD) staffed by RAEME While the regiment was responsible for providing direct support to the 1st Task Force, the 103rd Battery also served in the role of depot support for the School of Artillery. Consequently, it was issued with six M2A2 105 mm guns as well as six guns. As part of the 1980s restructuring, the 131st Divisional Locating Battery became an independent battery for divisional assignment at Enoggera Army Camp in Brisbane. The 102nd Field Battery was redesignated as the 102nd Medium Battery, and then disbanded in 1987. As a result of this downsizing, the Headquarters Battery was reduced in size in 1994. During 1996, the 101st Field Battery was removed from the 1st Field Regiment and embedded as a Fire Support Company in the 6 RAR, which adopted the A 21 Motorised Battalion structure that included supporting arms under the Restructuring of the Army (RTA) initiatives trial. As an integrated A 21 Motorised Battalion, the 6 RAR was restructured with one Reserve and one Regular Motorised Rifle Companies (Alpha and Delta Company respectively). The Fire Support Company included an Indirect Fire Platoon, which included 4 x 155mm M198 howitzers and two 120mm mortars (replicated by 2 x 105mm field guns), and a Direct Fire Platoon with four ASLAV 25 vehicles and a Weapon Locating/AMS Section. Reconnaissance and Surveillance Company included a Reconnaissance Platoon, a Surveillance Platoon, a Combat Engineer Platoon and a Sniper Section. The Administration Company was retitled Combat Service Support Company. After the deployment to East Timor, \\"A\\" Field Battery was assigned to the 4th Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery in 1999, further reducing the Regiment in size. During 1999, the 8th/12th Medium Regiment was relocated to Robertson Barracks in Darwin. While preparing for the move from Sydney to Darwin, the 103rd Medium Battery deployed its elements to East Timor as part of the INTERFET, and later as a part of a UN Peace Keeping Force OP TANAGER, and was later joined by the newly recreated 101st Medium Battery. An 8th/12th Regiment M777A2 lightweight 155 mm howitzer firing during an exercise in 2015 In January 2011, the Australian Regular Army's field regiments were reorganised in preparation for re-equipment with new guns and battle management systems. Each regiment was to contain three observation post batteries, supported by a single gun battery equipped with 12 guns. As part of this reorganisation, the regiments were renamed, with the words \\"field\\" or \\"medium\\" removed from their title. Under the new structure, each regiment is capable of providing a brigade-level Joint Fires and Effects Coordination Centre (JFECC) and every observation post battery provides a battle group JFECC as well as three combat team joint fires teams (JFT). Every gun battery now comprises three troops of 155 mm towed howitzers. In 2011, the 102nd Coral Battery was re-raised at RAAF Base Edinburgh. In 2008, the Governor-General had awarded the 102nd Field Battery with the Honour Title 'Coral‚Äô in recognition of conduct during the Battle of Coral in the Vietnam War. The 115th Battery was also raised in 2011 in theatre with Mentoring Task Force 2 in Afghanistan. Under the Land 17 project, in 2012, the 8th/12th Regiment received the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS), which is a fully automated digital battle- management system. It will also take delivery of the Digital Terminal Control System for observation post batteries. The regiment is currently based at Ypres Lines, Robertson Barracks, Palmerston; however, the 102nd battery is based at the Royal Australian Air Force base, Edinburgh. The gun troops are currently equipped with M777 LWH. In January 2014, the 102nd Coral Battery relocated from RAAF Base Edinburgh to Robertson Barracks.

He was studio assistant to Sir Edward Burne-Jones and later worked with Henry Holiday, the chief designer for James Powell and Sons, stained glass makers. Wooldridge was retained by Powell's and designed stained glass and tile paintings for more than twenty years. His church commissions included a reredos for St Martin's Church in Brighton (described as his chef d'≈ìuvre), and the painting of frescoes in St John-at-Hampstead. His growing authority on early music led to his 1895 appointment, succeeding John Ruskin as Slade Professor of Fine Art at Oxford. His main contributions to music literature are a new edition of William Chappell's Popular Music of the Olden Time, which appeared under the title Old English Popular Music (1893) and The Polyphonic Period, parts I. and II. (vols. i. and ii. of the Oxford History of Music, 1901‚Äì05).

Dr. Henry Jones Jr., better known as Indiana Jones, has secured his first teaching job as a professor in London University's archaeology department. It is here that Indy first meets a very attractive 20 year old Scottish girl by the name of Deirdre Campbell. She is the brightest student in his class but Indy quickly learns that her knowledge goes far past the contents of his lectures. In her thesis for the class, she quite seriously claims to have uncovered a golden scroll that proves of the true existence of Merlin the sorcerer.

Since it was discovered, it has been used for the treatment of cerebral vasospasm, which is often due to subarachnoid hemorrhage, as well as to improve the cognitive decline seen in stroke patients. It has been found to be effective for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. It was demonstrated in February 2009 that fasudil could improve memory in normal mice, identifying the drug as a possible treatment for age-related or neurodegenerative memory loss. It is approved for use in Japan and China, but has not been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration or by the European Medicines Agency.  Molecular mechanism  Fasudil (HA-1077) is a selective RhoA/Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor. ROCK is an enzyme that plays an important role in mediating vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension. ROCK induces vasoconstriction by phosphorylating the myosin- binding subunit of myosin light chain (MLC) phosphatase, thus decreasing MLC phosphatase activity and enhancing vascular smooth muscle contraction. = ACE expression = Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin-I (Ang-I) to angiotensin-II (Ang-II). Ang-II is a peptide hormone which increases blood pressure by initiating vasoconstriction and aldosterone secretion. ROCK increases ACE expression and activity in pulmonary hypertension. By inhibiting ROCK with fasudil, circulating ACE and Ang-II are reduced, leading to a decrease in pulmonary vascular pressure. = eNOS expression = Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mediates the production of the vasodilator nitric oxide (NO). Pulmonary arterial cell cultures treated with fasudil showed a significant increase in eNOS mRNA levels in a dose dependent manner, and the half-life of eNOS mRNA increased 2-folds. These findings suggested that ROCK inhibition with fasudil increases eNOS expression by stabilizing eNOS mRNA, which contributed to an increase of NO level to enhance vasodilation. = ERK activation = The proliferative effects of ROCK on vascular endothelial cells is due to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). ERK mediates cell proliferation via the phosphorylation of p27Kip1, thus accelerating the degradation rate of p27Kip1. p27Kip1 is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor which down-regulates cell cycle by binding cyclin-CDK complex. Human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells treated with fasudil showed a decrease in cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Fasudil also decreases ERK activities, as well as increases level of p27Kip1. This suggested that the anti-proliferative effects of fasudil is due to the decrease of ERK activities via the inhibition of ROCK.

It was released in 1972. A Magma album in disguise, The Unnamables was designed to ease listeners into the musical world of Magma. Recorded by essentially the same line-up as on 1001¬∞ Centigrades (1972), the album basically repeats the stylistic development shown through Magma's first two albums, while abandoning the science fiction concept of the Koba√Øan story. Three tracks from Lasry and one from Cahen on the first half of the album approximate the accessibility of the better-known jazz-rock of the time. Vander's pieces on the second half of the album, however, begin to explore similar musical ground to that found on 1001¬∞ Centigrades. Two of Vander's pieces can also be found on the 1970 soundtrack to 24 Heures Seulement and are available on the Archiw I CD in the Studio Z√ºnd 12 disc box collection. The Unnamables was originally released on Th√©l√®me, and reissued on Cryonic in 1986 and on Musea in 1993.

Biography George was educated at Cardiff High School and spent one session at University College, Cardiff before matriculating at Jesus College, Oxford in 1911 as a science scholar. He obtained a first-class degree in Natural Sciences in 1914. At the outbreak of the First World War, he enlisted in the Royal Welch Fusiliers, reaching the rank of lieutenant and seeing service at Gallipoli, where he was wounded. His health suffered further when posted to Mesopotamia, and he was invalided home. He then worked in the explosives department of the Ministry of Munitions, and gained first-hand knowledge of modern methods for manufacturing heavy chemicals. He was appointed by Jesus College as a Research Fellow and Lecturer in Chemistry in 1919, later becoming an Official Fellow and Tutor. He also held the college offices of Librarian, Junior Bursar and Senior Bursar. Within the university, he took charge of colloid chemistry and was appointed by Oxford University as one of its representatives on Oxford City Council. He was regarded as an authority on teaching science in schools, and was a member of committees in Wales and in Oxford controlling school examinations. His time for published work was limited by his other commitments, but he wrote on the absorption of gases on glass surfaces, on the theory of strong electrolytes and other subjects. He died on 19 April 1939 at the age of 46.

Rallies The group/ its subgroups of the IWAI host rallies over the Summer months annually. Examples of these rallies are: Shannon rally, Lough Derg rally and Lough Erne rally. The Shannon rally would be the biggest of these rallies. It can take part on any part of the Shannon. Rallies such the Lough Derg rally or Lough Erne take place in their respective areas. In the bigger rallies participants pay a fee to take part and can receive commemorative plaque to acknowledge their participation. Participants can take part in competitions held during the rally which could include testing boat operating skill level, rescuing drowning person from the water, table quiz, barbecue, fancy dress competition, music sessions and an award giving ceremony at the end. Some of the smaller branches hold small boat rallies with dingies. These are held more to demonstrate the usage of waterways (where it is being held) which are being actively restored or derelict.

After debuting on the Broadway stage in the 1979 revival of Oklahoma!, he went on to a career that saw him nominated for Tony Awards as Best Featured Actor in a Musical for Those Were the Days (1991) and Crazy For You (1992). His film work was limited to voice work in animated films, notably providing the singing voice for the narrator of the 1992 Disney film Aladdin and the 1996 sequel Aladdin and the King of Thieves. Early life Born in New York City, Adler's parents, Henrietta Jacobson and Julius Adler, and his two maternal uncles, Irving and Hymie Jacobson were well-established popular stars of the Yiddish theatre, at the time in its heyday on New York's Lower East Side. Adler made his stage debut at an early age, appearing with his parents. The three Adlers played the London Palladium with Sophie Tucker in the 1950s. He continued to appear in Yiddish theatre throughout his teens, also appearing in mainstream American theatre as his parents made a similar \\"crossover,\\" most notably appearing in productions of Neil Simon's Come Blow Your Horn. Career Adler served in the United States Army from 1966 through 1968. He continued his career thereafter, firmly straddling the two worlds of Yiddish and American Theatre. After much success in regional theatre, Adler made his Broadway debut as Ali Hakim, the Peddler, in the 35th anniversary production of Oklahoma! in 1979. He was following in the footsteps of actor Joseph Buloff, who had created the role in 1943, and also had a huge background on the Yiddish stage. Other Broadway shows included Oh, Brother! (1981), Sunday in the Park with George (1984), Broadway (1987), Rumors (1988), Those Were The Days (1991), where he won the Drama Desk Award, and Crazy for You (1992). Adler stayed with Crazy for You for the entirety of its four-year run on Broadway. Off-Broadway, Adler appeared in several well-received Yiddish speaking and Jewish-themed productions of the last 30 years, including The Golden Land (1985), On Second Avenue (1987),The Rise of David Levinsky (1987) and many others. He appeared in many summer productions at The Muny Theater in St. Louis. He had a voice role in Disney's animated film, Beauty and the Beast, as well as roles in television shows such as Law & Order. Adler created a second career for himself starting in the mid-1990s, with a series of shows which played to huge success in the legitimate theatres of South Florida from the Palm Beaches to Ft. Lauderdale to Miami. His shows paid tribute to the performers who had shaped his own style including Danny Kaye, Sammy Davis, Jr., Red Buttons, Cab Calloway and Jimmy Durante, among others. In a review of Adler's one-man show Song and Dance Man, The New York Times critic Richard F. Shepard wrote, \\"What is there that this man can't do? He kazotskys, he soft shoes, he fandangos...He makes the oldest jokes fresh and funny!...It is impossible to watch him without being seized by his infectious spirit, his complete enjoyment in what he is doing...he brings performing brilliance to the stage!\\" Personal life and death Adler's first marriage ended in divorce in 2002. He married director/actress Amy London in 2003. In February 2007, he and London had their first child together, Jacob Hayden Adler. Bruce Adler died of liver cancer at age 63 on July 25, 2008. His last public appearance was in May 2008 at Carnegie Hall, where he recreated several numbers that evening in a gala celebration for the New York Festival of Song.

History  At the conclusion of World War II, the 120th National Guard Command () was formed in Lesbos, overseeing the territorial National Guard battalions - predominantly reservist and militia units - based on the island. This formation evolved, on 20 April 1975, into the 98th Military Command (), and again on 12 March 1978, into the 98th National Guard Higher Command, consisting of two infantry regiments (22nd and 36th), with artillery and armored support elements. Despite its \\"National Guard\\" moniker, which honors the formation's previous territorial incarnations, the 98 ADTE evolved through the 1980s and 1990s into a mechanized infantry division. In October 2009 the 98 ADTE was given the honorific title \\"Archipelago\\" in commemoration of the World War I-era Archipelago Division. Emblem and motto The emblem of the 98th National Guard Higher Command is a lion facing east, above a graphic depiction of the island of Lesbos. The division's motto is Men are the 's Towers (; Andres G√°r P√≥lios P√Ωrgos). The phrase is attributed to Greek lyric poet Alcaeus of Mytilene, a native of Lesbos, and is taken from his political songs, or Stasiotika ().

Thermo-mechanical fatigue is an important point that needs to be considered, when constructing turbine engines or gas turbines. Failure mechanisms There are three mechanisms acting in thermo-mechanical fatigue *Creep is the flow of material at high temperatures *Fatigue is crack growth and propagation due to repeated loading *Oxidation is a change in the chemical composition of the material due to environmental factors. The oxidized material is more brittle and prone to crack creation. Each factor has more or less of an effect depending on the parameters of loading. In phase (IP) thermo-mechanical loading (when the temperature and load increase at the same time) is dominated by creep. The combination of high temperature and high stress is the ideal condition for creep. The heated material flows more easily in tension, but cools and stiffens under compression. Out of phase (OP) thermo-mechanical loading is dominated by the effects of oxidation and fatigue. Oxidation weakens the surface of the material, creating flaws and seeds for crack propagation. As the crack propagates, the newly exposed crack surface then oxidizes, weakening the material further and enabling the crack to extend. A third case occurs in OP TMF loading when the stress difference is much greater than the temperature difference. Fatigue alone is the driving cause of failure in this case, causing the material to fail before oxidation can have much of an effect.Nagesha, A et al. \\"A comparative study of isothermal and thermomechanical fatigue on type 316L(N) austenitic stainless steel\\" Materials Science and Engineering: A, 2010 TMF still is not fully understood. There are many different models to attempt to predict the behavior and life of materials undergoing TMF loading. The two models presented below take different approaches. Models There are many different models that have been developed in an attempt to understand and explain TMF. This page will address the two broadest approaches, constitutive and phenomenological models. Constitutive models utilize the current understanding of the microstructure of materials and failure mechanisms. These models tend to be more complex, as they try to incorporate everything we know about how the materials fail. These types of models are becoming more popular recently as improved imaging technology has allowed for a better understanding of failure mechanisms. Phenomenological models are based purely on the observed behavior of materials. They treat the exact mechanism of failure as a sort of \\"black box\\". Temperature and loading conditions are input, and the result is the fatigue life. These models try to fit some equation to match the trends found between different inputs and outputs. =Damage accumulation model= The damage accumulation model is a constitutive model of TMF. It adds together the damage from the three failure mechanisms of fatigue, creep, and oxidation. \\\\frac {1} {N_f} = \\\\frac {1} {N_f^{fatigue}} + \\\\frac {1} {N_f^{oxidation}} + \\\\frac {1} {N_f^{creep}} where N_f is the fatigue life of the material, that is, the number of loading cycles until failure. The fatigue life for each failure mechanism is calculated individually and combined to find the total fatigue life of the specimen.Changan, Chai et al. \\"Recent Developments in the Thermomechanical Fatigue Life Prediction of Superalloys\\", JOM, April 1999\\"Thermo Mechanical Technical Background\\" Fatigue The life from fatigue is calculated for isothermal loading conditions. It is dominated by the strain applied to the specimen. \\\\frac {\\\\Delta \\\\epsilon_m} {2} = C(2N_f^{fatigue})^d where C and d are material constants found through isothermal testing. Note that this term does not account for temperature effects. The effects of temperature are treated in the oxidation and creep terms.. Oxidation The life from oxidation is affected by temperature and cycle time. \\\\frac {1} {N_f^{oxidation}} = \\\\left(\\\\frac {h_{cr}\\\\delta_0} {B\\\\Phi^{oxidation}K_p^{eff}}\\\\right)^{\\\\frac {-1} {\\\\beta}} \\\\frac {2(\\\\Delta \\\\dot{\\\\epsilon_m})^{\\\\frac {2} {\\\\beta} +1}} {\\\\epsilon^{1-\\\\alpha / \\\\beta}} where K_p^{eff} = \\\\frac {1} {t_c} \\\\int_0^t D_0 exp \\\\left(\\\\frac {-Q} {RT(t)} \\\\right) dt and \\\\Phi^{oxidation} = \\\\frac {1} {t_c} \\\\int_0^t exp \\\\left[-\\\\frac {1} {2} \\\\left(\\\\frac{(\\\\dot{\\\\epsilon_{th}} / \\\\dot{\\\\epsilon_m}) + 1} {\\\\dot{\\\\zeta}^{oxidation}} \\\\right)^2 \\\\right] dt Parameters are found by comparing fatigue tests done in air and in an environment with no oxygen (vacuum or argon). Under these testing conditions, it has been found that the effects of oxidation can reduce the fatigue life of a specimen by a whole order of magnitude. Higher temperatures greatly increase the amount of damage from environmental factors.Heckel, T. K. et al. \\"Thermomechanical Fatigue of the TiAl Intermetallic Alloy TNB-V2\\" Experimental Mechanics, 2009 Creep D^{creep} = \\\\Phi^{creep} \\\\int_0^t Ae^{(-\\\\Delta H/RT(t))} \\\\left(\\\\frac {\\\\alpha_1 \\\\bar{\\\\sigma} + \\\\alpha_2 \\\\sigma_H} {K} \\\\right)^m dt where \\\\Phi^{creep} = \\\\frac {1} {t_c} \\\\int_0^t exp \\\\left[ -\\\\frac {1}{2} \\\\left( \\\\frac {(\\\\dot{\\\\epsilon_{th}}/ \\\\dot{\\\\epsilon_m})-1} {\\\\dot{\\\\zeta}^{creep}} \\\\right)^2 \\\\right] dt Benefit The damage accumulation model is one of the most in-depth and accurate models for TMF. It accounts for the effects of each failure mechanism. Drawback The damage accumulation model is also one of the most complex models for TMF. There are several material parameters that must be found through extensive testing.Minichmayr, Robert et al. \\"Thermo-mechanical fatigue life assessment of aluminum components using the damage rate model of Sehitoglu\\" International Journal of Fatigue, 2008 =Strain-rate partitioning= Strain-rate partitioning is a phenomenological model of thermo-mechanical fatigue. It is based on observed phenomenon instead of the failure mechanisms. This model deals only with inelastic strain and ignores elastic strain completely. It accounts for different types of deformation and breaks strain into four possible scenarios:Zhuang, W.

Benefit Strain-Rate Partitioning is a much simpler model than the damage accumulation model. Because it breaks down the loading into specific scenarios, it can account for different phases in loading. Drawback The model is based on inelastic strain. This means that it does not work well with scenarios of low inelastic strain, such as brittle materials or loading with very low strain. This model can be an oversimplification. Because it fails to account for oxidation damage, it may overpredict specimen life in certain loading conditions. Looking forward The next area of research is attempting to understand TMF of composites. The interaction between the different materials adds another layer of complexity. Zhang and Wang are currently investigating the TMF of a unidirectional fiber reinforced matrix. They are using a finite element method that accounts for the known microstructure. They have discovered that the large difference in the thermal expansion coefficient between the matrix and the fiber is the driving cause of failure, causing high internal stress.Zhang, Junqian and Fang Wang \\"Modeling of Damage Evolution and Failure in Fiber-Reinforced Ductile Composites Under Thermomechanical Fatigue Loading\\" International Journal of Damage Mechanics, 2010 References Mechanical engineering Fracture mechanics ","title":"Thermo-mechanical fatigue"},{"id":"18591433","text":"ƒ∞brahim ≈ûen (born 1 October 1980) is a citizen of Turkey who was held in extrajudicial detention in the United States's Guantanamo Bay detention camps, in Cuba.Guantanamo‚Äôda iki yƒ±l yatmƒ±≈üGAZETE VATAN His Guantanamo Internment Serial Number was 297.

Life Piatti was born in Wangen-Br√ºttisellen, the son of a Ticino stonemason and a Zurich farmer's daughter. He grew up in Dietlikon, near Z√ºrich. Between 1938 and 1942 he trained in the Gebr√ºder Fretz studio, and took evening classes with Ernst und Max Gubler at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Zurich (today the Z√ºrcher Hochschule der K√ºnste), and then qualified as a graphic teacher. Between 1945 and the end of 1948 he worked in the studio of Fritz B√ºhler in Basel. From 1948 he had his own graphic design studio. In 1966 he settled in Duggingen near Basel, where he lived until his death. His first international success came as a designer of posters. He designed more than five hundred, many of which won prizes. In 1964 his work was included in the graphic design section of documenta III in Kassel. heart logo, created by Piatti for the German Heart Foundation, Frankfurt In 1961 Piatti became the designer for the newly founded Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag (dtv) of Munich. As well as their cover designs, Piatti was responsible for the company's typography, signets, letterheads, advertisements and posters, giving the DTV catalogue a uniform identity which combined the International Typographic Style with quirky illustration. His distinctive covers used the sans-serif Akzidenz-Grotesk typeface in black against a white background. From 1961, beginning with Heinrich B√∂ll's Irisches Tagebuch, to 1991, he designed almost all of DTV's publications, a total of more than 6,300 titles.

It was directed by Jud Taylor, under the pseudonym Alan Smithee, and written by Peter Masterson and Albert Ruben. The film score was composed by Leonard Rosenman. The film stars David Janssen (one of his last roles), Robert Vaughn, Mickey Rourke, Perry King, William Prince and Susan Sullivan. It is about a newspaper's attempts to sensationalize the killing spree of a psychopath. Filmed in mid 1979, it premiered in the US on March 30, 1980 on the ABC channel, one month after Janssen's death.IMDb release dates Plot Vince Perrino is a frustrated, cynical, alcoholic, chain smoking newspaper columnist who is hired by a wealthy publisher, named Harrison Crawford III, who hopes that Perrino can revamp a small Los Angeles newspaper agency that Crawford just bought out when a series of murders of young women begins all over the city. Crawford wants Perrino's expertise to make the killings front-page news. Meanwhile, the killer is revealed to the viewers to be a dangerously disturbed grocery store employee, named Tony Pate, who is one of several suspects that LAPD detectives, John Armstrong and Raymond Zavala, are investigating. Part of the plot is loosely based on the Son of Sam murders and shows a deep insight how newspapers and television news will go to extreme lengths to sell papers in order to exploit a time of a local crisis.

Emmet Walsh - Sheldon Lewis *Christopher Allport - Kenny Reiger *Lane Smith - Brian *Frank McRae - Captain Madison *Mary Stuart Masterson - Abby Crawford Production The film was inspired by a conversation between two friends, William Goldman and Pete Masterson. Goldman got the idea when he came home one afternoon to find that his daughter, then about twelve, had tried to dye her hair because the real life serial killer, Son Of Sam, was said to be killing dark-haired women. Goldman was horrified that exploitive press accounts had reached into his home and frightened his daughter and saw a story in the interplay of killer and press. \\"That's how pervasive women's fear became,\\" said director Jud Taylor. Goldman told Masterson \\"this would make a terrific TV movie\\" and they hired Albert Rubin to write a script and novelist and friend Linda Stewart to write a novel based on the idea. The novel was published by Delacorte under the title \\"Panic on Page One\\" to solid reviews in the New York Times (October 28, 1979)[3] and the L.A. Times (September 16, 1979) among others. For the ABC-TV movie, Taylor cast Mickey Rourke as the killer. \\"It was one of Mickey's first big parts, and he was extraordinary, and conveyed just the sense of casual menace -- he was a bag boy in a Los Angeles supermarket, for God's sake -- that we wanted.\\" Director Jud Taylor later made Out of the Darkness based on the policeman who investigated the Son of Sam case. Taylor had his name removed from the film. \\"After I left, the producers filmed four more point-blank murders without asking me, and I was offended,\\" he said. Stewart, called in to do a rewrite of the script \\" to make it closer to the novel\\" also removed her name when her changes were changed.

An Allegory (second half of the 18th century), by Piat Sauvage Piat Joseph Sauvage (19 January 1744 in Tournai ‚Äì 11 June 1818 in Tournai) was a Belgian painter. Piat's father, Antoine, was a glass cutter. Piat worked in his father's factory until the age of 17, when he completed his technical schooling in drawing. He went on to improve his artistic education at the Antwerp Academy under the direction of Martin Joseph Geeraerts, an expert in grisaille and historic paintings. He worked for a time in Brussels under the rule of the Habsburgs. He then joined the Saint Luc Academy in Paris, and in 1774 made nine paintings including the grisaille bas-relief La Mort de Germanicus (The Death of Germanicus). Sauvage was accepted into the Acad√®mie royal de Paris after he produced a well-known painting of a round table with an embroidered cloth on which stand a statue of a child, a helmet, books, a violin, and other items. This canvas is at the Palace of Fontainebleau which also has other dessus-de-porte decorative works by this artist. As his fame grew, he was chosen as the official painter of the Prince de Cond√©, and then by Louis XVI and the Royal Family. During this period, he painted Marie- Antoinette and produced paintings for the chapel of Saint-Cloud among other works. His appointment as Royal artist did not keep him from joining the popular side of the French Revolution. His painting surprisingly did not slow down during this period of political upheaval. From 1804 to 1807, he painted porcelain figurines for the famous S√®vres porcelain factory. In 1808 he returned to Tournai to become the director of the Academy of Drawing. Until 1817, he succeeded in this role while famous artists such as Antoine Payen studied there. He also painted the Sept Sacrements, or Seven Sacraments, in the choir of the Tournai cathedral in order to replace the superb tapestries stolen by the Jacobins during the revolution.

The term was introduced in the Muyesinbo of 1759, and the system was supposedly a creation of Crown Prince Sado. It contrasts with Jedok geom, or \\"admiral sword\\", a system supposedly introduced by the Chinese admiral Li Rusong during the 16th-century Imjin War (the \\"national sword\\" system is conspicuously absent from the older Muyejebo manual of 1610). The Muyesinbo stresses the antiquity of this \\"national\\" Korean system by including the narrative of a Silla \\"Flower Youth\\" called Hwangchang, who killed Baekje's king while performing a sword dance, known as Geommu, at the court. The historical swords of the Silla period would have been double-edged and comparable to those of the Eastern Han dynastic period (see also Hwandudaedo). However, the Bonguk geom, as presented in the 18th- century manual, is historically based on a single-edged sword; a type common during that era. In contemporary schools of Korean swordsmanship, the term bonguk geom is used to emphasize their \\"national\\" Korean character, without necessarily bearing a direct relation to the 18th-century system.

Major field(s) : * Human rights, * Non violence * Education SAVE is possibly the first-registered Anti Ragging NGO in India. It is mainly composed of professionals and students from various fieldsTimes of India who volunteer for the cause over and above their regular jobs/studies.  Formation  Ragging has been taking a huge toll of innocent lives and careers for long. But there had been no single civil movement against the evil of ragging. There were websites and online groups, from where some conscientious youths gave birth to a non profit organisation, which later came to fame in the name of the \\"No Ragging Foundation\\". Later, the No Ragging Foundation was registered as the Society Against Violence in Education (SAVE). Amit Sahai Gangwar, a first year student of NIT-Jalandhar lost his life in October 2005. The news was covered by various media - news channels and dailies. This event had a great impact in the formation of this organization.  Mission  The Society Against Violence in Education (SAVE) is an impartial, neutral and independent, non-profit organization whose exclusively humanitarian mission is to protect the lives and dignity of students in educational institutions and to provide the victims of 'ragging' with assistance and also to facilitate the eradication of ragging from educational institutions through awareness, advocacy, research and such other avenues. It works towards the creation of an environment where students can learn with fun and not with fear. It directs its efforts towards elimination of violence and abuses on innocent freshers while promoting peace and harmony among the senior and the juniors students in academic institutions.  Objectives  Create a strong public mandate against ragging. Device alternative but healthy and humane modes of interaction between seniors & juniors. Unite the isolated protests against ragging under the umbrella of a strong, united movement. Involve the authorities, faculties, students and others in the anti ragging drives.  Activities  * Awareness - Encouraging healthy interactions and friendly campuses * Supporting & Empowering the victims and their families * Consultation to educational institutions in implementing anti-ragging measures. * Research and training * Activism, advocacy, etc. = Awareness - Encouraging healthy interactions and friendly campuses = They spread the awareness against ragging and provide support to the victims. They also promote healthy and humane modes of interactions between the seniors and the juniors. They promote anti-ragging campus units, involving students, class and faculty members. SAVE has been arranging awareness events, mainly in educational institutions in different parts of India, involving students, faculty members and other stakeholders. Such events serve to empower and encourage the freshers (potential victims) as well as to promote healthy modes of interactions. The events are used to guide institutional authorities, if required, on effectively implementing anti ragging measures in the campus. Faculties and students have admired such events to be very useful for the cause. SAVE has arranged events in different parts of the country, for example : Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kanpur, Varanasi, Ajmer, Hyderabad, Dehradun, Surat, Pune, Haldia, Durgapur, Howrah, etc. SAVE has sent thousands of communications to colleges as well. = Supporting & Empowering the victims and their families = For about a decade, SAVE has been supporting the victims of ragging and/or their families in various ways. SAVE volunteers have supported victims in getting their grievances heard. They have played active roles in creating pressure on colleges to take actions and have provided legal and other guidance and assistance to the victims and their families. SAVE keeps in touch with the National (UGC) Anti Ragging Helpline and with its monitoring agency. SAVE has filed numerous applications under the Right to Information Act, 2005 with institutions as well as statutory bodies. SAVE legal team, led by advocate Mrs. Meera Kaura Patel , has even represented victims in the court and before the National Human Rights Commission of India. In a case involving the School of Planning and Architecture, Delhi, following the directions from the hon'ble court, the police had booked the Dean, Director and Registrar were charged under IPC Sections 336, 337, 338 (negligence), 120B (conspiracy), 201 (tampering with evidence), 202, 176 (failing to inform a public authority) and 511 (attempting to commit offence). In another case, from Thanjavur, SAVE Legal Team had requested the hon'ble Chief Justice of Tamil Nadu to take suo motu cognizance of the matter. 5 engineering students were arrested later. In some cases, SAVE has collaborated with the friends and family members of 'victims', who had lost their lives in 'ragging', to arrange memorial events and to demand proper investigation into the cases. The events were clubbed with signature campaigns seeking a comprehensive national anti ragging legislation. In many cases, the colleges have taken actions based on SAVE's recommendations. Some Colleges have been proactively invited SAVE to address their students and faculties. Several colleges have invited SAVE to be part of their anti ragging committee, however it was not possible for SAVE to accept all such offers, considering its limitations, e.g., financial limitations. = Other Activities = * Guidance : SAVE extends technical guidance to academic institutions and others on curbing the menace of ragging. * Research & Training  Recognition  * Apart from wide acceptance by academic institutions, students, teachers and other stakeholders, SAVE has featured in several news reports by the national print media, electronic media as well as by the international media. * SAVE was invited to the famous Indian Television show Satyamev Jayate (TV series) season 3, Episode 6 - which is anchored by Indian superstar Aamir Khan . SAVE's national co-ordinator Gaurav Singhal (an alumnus of the IIT-Kanpur) represented SAVE on the show. Some past victims, who were in contact with SAVE and the father of Amit Gangwar (the death of whom led to the birth of SAVE) took part in the show. Satyamev Jayate published an article on their website recommending SAVE. * SAVE's honorary legal head, advocate Meera Kaura Patel has been a key speaker at a national Seminar organized by the National Human Rights Commission of India . * Several Bollywood celebrities, like Mr. Salman Khan, Amole Gupte , Amrita Rao and Suniel Shetty have supported the movement as well. * SAVE members have been invited to speak at various institutions as well as at international events.

The cartridge was released together with the .465 H&H; Magnum in 2003. It is based on the .375 H&H; Magnum case. General Information The cartridge owes its development to hunters requesting Holland & Holland to develop a cartridge which would have increased power over the .375 H&H; Magnum. The project was undertaken by Russell Wilkin, the technical director for Holland & Holland. The result was two cartridges: the .400 H&H; Magnum and the .465 H&H; magnum. The cartridge was launched in 2003 to the public in 2003 in the UK and Europe and became available in North America in 2008. It follows in a long line of illustrious big bore cartridges introduced by Holland & Holland, the last of which was the .700 Nitro Express. The .400 H&H; Magnum is a modern rifle cartridge designed for the hunting large and dangerous game animals. The cartridge would be legal in countries which require a .400 minimum caliber for the hunting of dangerous game. It was engineered to provide dependable reliability in a tropical environment. The gradual tapering and moderate shoulder of the cartridge provides for reliable feeding and extraction of the cartridge. Specifications of interest to reloaders include a standard magnum rim diameter of .532\\". Overall case length is 2.85\\" (the same as the .375 case), and the cartridge overall length is 3.50\\". Bullet diameter is .411\\" and factory loaded bullets are to be supplied by Woodleigh of Australia. These will be the same 400 grain Premium solid and Weldcore soft point bullets sold to reloaders and used in .450/400 NE factory loads. In addition, Hornady offers a 300 grain .411\\" Interlock bullet to reloaders. This bullet is intended for the .405 Winchester, and with moderate reloads it should be quite suitable for North American CXP3 game in the .400 H&H.; And one could probably use .410\\" jacketed pistol bullets intended for the .41 Magnum revolver cartridge for low velocity, low recoil practice loads. Performance The .400 H&H; Magnum is in the same class as the .416 Rigby and the .416 Remington Magnum with the arguably slight advantage of better sectional density given bullet of equal weight. The typical bullet will have a sectional density of .338 for the .400 H&H; Magnum vs. .330 for the .416 caliber cartridges. The .400 H&H; Magnum shares the same caliber with several .400 cartridges from the turn of the 20th century such as the .400 Jeffery Nitro Express, the 405 Winchester and the series of .450/400 cartridges. Brass stock is available from Quality Cartridge. As of 2012 Holland & Holland and Mauser produce rifles of this caliber in Europe and Dakota Arms is the sole manufacturer of this rifle in the United States. Dakota Arms custom manufactures this caliber in their Model 97 Safari series. Bullets are available from different manufacturers such as Barnes, Hornady, Woodleigh and Kynoch. In 2010.

At the age of 15 he became clerk to the steward of Magdalen College, Oxford and began a lifelong involvement in the management of the college's London estates. After several years working on plans for new buildings, around 1801 he became bailiff and collector of rents for Magdalen College in Freeman's Court, London, and in Southwark, and held this post until his retirement in 1849. The work for the college allowed him ample free time, and he also practised as an architect until 1830, designing buildings such as Halkyn Castle, Flint (1822‚Äì27) for Robert Grosvenor, 2nd Earl Grosvenor (later created Marquess of Westminster) the tower of the church in Theale, Berkshire (1827‚Äì28).Tyack, 2004 Glastonbury Priory, also called Abbey House, Somerset (1829‚Äì30) for J.F. Reeves, and Poll Park, Denbighshire (c. 1828), for William Bagot, 2nd Baron Bagot, \\"an early essay in the half-timbered style\\", according to Howard Colvin, who suggested that Buckler had a hand in the Gothic remodelling of Blithfield Hall, Staffordshire, for Lord Bagot, 1822‚Äì23. He or his son also designed the church of St. John the Baptist, Pentrobin, now Penymynydd, in the County of Flintshire, 1843, for Sir Stephen Glynne, as one of the first Gothic Revival churches that came out of the Cambridge Camden Society. The Holy Trinity Church in Theale, Berkshire. The tower was designed by John Buckler. Buckler's interest in art developed over time, and his first published works were two aquatints of Magdalen College in 1797. He followed these in 1799 with an engraving of Lincoln Cathedral; the first in a series which included all the cathedrals in England by 1814, as well as many of the collegiate and parish churches. Shortly after 1800 he was commissioned by Richard Colt Hoare of Stourhead to produce ten volumes of drawings of churches and other historic buildings in Wiltshire, and Buckler's grandson described this commission as \\"deciding his brains for antiquarian pursuits\\". It was followed by similar commissions from other antiquarians, such as William Salt of Staffordshire, and by the end of his life, by his own account, Buckler had produced around 13,000 drawings of buildings. Many of the buildings Buckler drew had not been previously recorded, and many have since been demolished or substantially altered, so his work is now a valuable source of information on British architectural history. His work was exhibited at the Royal Academy every year from 1798 until 1849, and he became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1810.

The first blast occurred at about 7:00 am (2300 GMT Sunday) when the vehicle was at a bus stop, killing one woman and injuring 10 other people, the statement from Kunming police said. \\"The glass on both sides of the vehicle was all shattered and some of the seats were warped,\\" it said.

The company was nationalised in 1944, and evolved into the National Gas Turbine Establishment. History Founded on 27 January 1936, the company consisted of Whittle, Rolf Dudley-Williams, James Collingwood Tinling, and Lancelot Law Whyte of investment bankers O T Falk & Partners. Initial premises were hired from British Thomson-Houston (BTH) at Rugby, Warwickshire. In addition to the founder members, the company initially 'borrowed' some fitters from BTH to assist in the project and later Power Jets was able to get 'one or two' people on loan from the Royal Air Force. By the beginning of 1940 the company had a total workforce of about twenty five. In 1938 Power Jets had moved from Rugby to BTH's works in Lutterworth. A major breakthrough for the company came in 1940 when at the prompting of Stanley Hooker, Ernest Hives, chairman of Rolls-Royce, visited Lutterworth, and offered to make any parts Whittle required at Rolls-Royce's Derby experimental shop.\\"World Encyclopedia of Aero Engines - 5th edition\\" by Bill Gunston, Sutton Publishing, 2006, p.191 The Power Jets WU design was the first turbojet to run, being first tested on 12 April 1937,http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1973/1973%20-%202990.html and the Power Jets W.1 powered the Gloster E.28/39, the first jet aircraft to fly in the United Kingdom. The W.1 was also the first jet engine built in the United States where, as the General Electric I-A, it was the first US-built jet engine to run, and as the production General Electric J31 it powered the Bell P-59A Airacomet. In 1941 experiments with boosting the W.1's thrust by introducing a liquid coolant were initiated, the first fluid tried being liquid ammonia which proved too effective, resulting in the engine over- speeding and pushing the thrust and rpm indicators off the scales, before later trials changed to using water, and water-methanol. A system to trial the technique in the E.28/39 was devised but never fitted.https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1947/1947%20-%201359.html The Power Jets W.2 was intended to be produced by Rover, but because of delays was later transferred to Rolls-Royce where it entered production as the Welland, powering early versions of the Gloster Meteor. The W.2B/500 design, modified by Rover as the B.26, after transfer to Rolls-Royce and further re- design, entered service as the Derwent, which replaced the Welland in the Meteor. After initial suggestions in 1939 by the Engine Department of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), the latter's Pyestock Section experimented with the technique of injecting fuel into the engine's exhaust nozzle, later known as reheat, and this technique was further refined after Power Jets and the personnel from Pyestock had been amalgamated. Reheat was later fight trialled in the W.2/700 engines in a Meteor I. The technique increased the Meteor's speed by 30-40 mph. The same engine was also trialled with an aft ducted fan.\\"World Encyclopedia of Aero Engines - 5th edition\\" by Bill Gunston, Sutton Publishing, 2006, p.160 A version of the Power Jets W.2/700 was intended for the Miles M.52 supersonic research aircraft, but the aircraft was never completed. On 28 March 1944, after discussions with the Air Ministry, Whittle reluctantly agreed to the nationalisation of Power Jets Ltd. for ¬£135,000, and the company became Power Jets (Research and Development) Ltd. After the Second World War the company was merged with the Turbine Division of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) at Farnborough, to form the National Gas Turbine Establishment (NGTE Pyestock). In 1951 Power Jets received $4,000,000 (¬£1,428,600) from the US Government in advance payment for US use of some 200 Power Jets Whittle gas turbine patents for the next 20 years. Previously, patent fees payable by the US had been waived by Power Jets for the duration of the war.https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1951/1951%20-%202094.html The last remnants of the company were disestablished in 1948.

Early life and education Gregg was born on 7 March 1892 in Burwood, a suburb of Sydney. He was educated at Homebush Grammar School and Sydney Grammar School, and then studied medicine at the University of Sydney, graduating with a Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery and first-class honours in 1915.Paul A.

He left the army on 7 March 1920, retaining the rank of captain. Relinquishment of commission The citation for his MC read: Medical career Returning to Australia, Gregg was appointed resident medical officer at Sydney's Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPA). He returned to England to study ophthalmology, gaining a diploma of ophthalmic medicine and surgery after training at Moorfields Eye Hospital and Royal Westminster Ophthalmic Hospital in London, and the Birmingham and Midland Counties Eye Hospital. Gregg returned to Sydney, where he set up a practice in 1923. That same year he was appointed ophthalmic surgeon at RPA, and the same post at the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children from 1925. In 1950 he was made a consultant at the Royal Alexandra, and in 1952 at the RPA. =Congenital rubella syndrome= When World War II began, Gregg was a paediatric ophthalmologist, at a time when most doctors had joined the army and he was one of few eye doctors in Sydney. Gregg noticed a high incidence of congenital cataracts in infants arriving at his surgery ‚Äì two to three times the normal rate that would be expected from hereditary factors. He overheard a conversation between several mothers whose babies had cataracts, in which they mentioned that they had suffered from German measles (rubella) during pregnancy. Investigating the medical records of children with similar conditions, Gregg discovered that out of 78 affected children, 68 had been exposed to rubella in utero. There had been an outbreak of rubella and meningitis in Australian army camps in 1941, which had been transmitted to the wider community when the men returned to their families.Manteuil-Brutlag, Simone: Sir Norman McAllister Gregg , Stanford University. On 15 October 1941, Gregg delivered a paper, Congenital Cataract following German Measles in the Mother, to the Ophthalmological Society of Australia in Melbourne which published it in its journal, Transactions. Following press coverage of his paper, Gregg was contacted by two mothers who had contracted rubella, and whose children suffered from deafness, and he subsequently issued a further paper detailing Further Observations on Congenital Defects in Infants following Maternal Rubella. Whilst Gregg's findings were met with praise in Australia, internationally his peers were not so convinced. British medical journal The Lancet wrote that he had failed to adequately prove his case, and it was not until Professor Oliver Lancaster of the University of Sydney proved the association between the rubella virus and congenital syndromes in infants was significant, that his research was accepted around the world.

When constructed, the Fujairah plant was the first hybrid plant in the Middle East, and the largest desalination hybrid plant in the world. History A construction contract was awarded to Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction Company in June 2001 and the contract was signed in June 2002. In August 2001, a contract for the transmission systems was awarded to a joint venture of Al Jaber Energy Services and Technip. The first few liters of potable water were produced in April 2004. Total construction costs of the project were US$1.2 billion On June 2009 Sembcorp had announced that it had successfully boosted F1's power capacity by at least 40%.

It is a natural gas-fired plant supplied from the Dolphin Gas Project through the Al Ain-Fujairah pipeline. Its annual consumption is of natural gas. Its power generating side consists of four gas turbines, two heat recovery steam generators and two steam turbines in a combined cycle configuration. 120 MW of capacity is used for the water desalination process and 36 MW accounted for the transmission lost, leaving 500 MW of capacity for supplies to the grid through a long double circuit 400 kV transmission line. For the water desalination, the Fujairah plant uses a combination of two different desalination technologies. of water is produced using multi-stage flash distillation (MSF) technology and of water is produced using reverse osmosis technology (RO). The water production system consists of five MSF units producing of water each and one RO unit. Potable water is stored in five tanks, each. The water output is pumped to Sweihan through a dual pipeline with an spur to Al Dhaid in Sharjah. Operating company The plant was originally owned by the Union Water and Electricity Company (UWEC), established in June 2001 as a government owned company through the Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority (ADWEA). The plant was operated and maintained by Sogex Oman under agreement with UWEC. In 2006, 40% stake in UWEC was sold to Singapore-based Sembcorp Utilities and SembCorp took over the plant's operating activities. After privatization the company was renamed Emirates SembCorp Water and Power Company. Mahabir Kumar Sharma was the General Manager of the operating company from at least 2007 to 2010. William Chang was continued as General Manager from at least 2011 to at least 2013.alt= Future expansion According to the privatization agreement, the power capacity of the Fujairah plant would be expanded by 225 MW and water production would be expanded by of water per day.

The purpose of a boycott is to inflict some economic loss on the target, or to indicate a moral outrage, to try to compel the target to alter an objectionable behavior. The word is named after Captain Charles Boycott, agent of an absentee landlord in Ireland, against whom the tactic was successfully employed after a suggestion by Irish nationalist leader Charles Stewart Parnell and his Irish Land League in 1880. Sometimes, a boycott can be a form of consumer activism, sometimes called moral purchasing. When a similar practice is legislated by a national government, it is known as a sanction. Etymology Vanity Fair caricature of Charles C. Boycott The word boycott entered the English language during the Irish \\"Land War\\" and derives from Captain Charles Boycott, the land agent of an absentee landlord, Lord Erne, who lived in Lough Mask House, near Ballinrobe in County Mayo, Ireland, who was subject to social ostracism organized by the Irish Land League in 1880. As harvests had been poor that year, Lord Erne offered his tenants a ten percent reduction in their rents. In September of that year, protesting tenants demanded a twenty five percent reduction, which Lord Erne refused. Boycott then attempted to evict eleven tenants from the land. Charles Stewart Parnell, in a speech in Ennis prior to the events in Lough Mask, proposed that when dealing with tenants who take farms where another tenant was evicted, rather than resorting to violence, everyone in the locality should shun them. While Parnell's speech did not refer to land agents or landlords, the tactic was first applied to Boycott when the alarm was raised about the evictions. Despite the short-term economic hardship to those undertaking this action, Boycott soon found himself isolated ‚Äì his workers stopped work in the fields and stables, as well as in his house. Local businessmen stopped trading with him, and the local postman refused to deliver mail. The concerted action taken against him meant that Boycott was unable to hire anyone to harvest the crops in his charge. Eventually 50 Orangemen from Cavan and Monaghan volunteered to do the work. They were escorted to and from Claremorris by one thousand policemen and soldiers, despite the fact that the local Land League leaders had said that there would be no violence from them, and in fact no violence happened. This protection ended up costing far more than the harvest was worth. After the harvest, the \\"boycott\\" was successfully continued. Within weeks Boycott's name was everywhere. The New-York Tribune reporter, James Redpath, first wrote of the boycott in the international press. The Irish author, George Moore, reported: 'Like a comet the verb 'boycott' appeared.'Stanford, Jane, That Irishman: the Life and Times of John O'Connor Power, pp. 95‚Äì97. It was used by The Times in November 1880 as a term for organized isolation. According to an account in the book The Fall of Feudalism in Ireland by Michael Davitt, the term was promoted by Fr. John O'Malley of County Mayo to \\"signify ostracism applied to a landlord or agent like Boycott\\". The Times first reported on November 20, 1880: \\"The people of New Pallas have resolved to 'boycott' them and refused to supply them with food or drink.\\" The Daily News wrote on December 13, 1880: \\"Already the stoutest- hearted are yielding on every side to the dread of being 'Boycotted'.\\" By January of the following year, the word was being used figuratively: \\"Dame Nature arose.... She 'Boycotted' London from Kew to Mile End\\" (The Spectator, January 22, 1881). Girlcott is a portmanteau of girl and boycott intended to focus on the rights or actions of women. The term was coined in 1968 by American track star Lacey O'Neal during the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, in the context of protests by male African American athletes. Speaking for black women athletes, she advised that the group would not \\"girlcott\\" the Olympic Games, because female athletes were still focused on being recognized. It also appeared in Time magazine in 1970.Cinema: Merely Graphic - Stefan Kanfer, Time, 12 October 1970 The term was later used by retired tennis player Billie Jean King in 1999 in reference to Wimbledon, while discussing equal pay for women players.ON TENNIS; A Potential 'Girl-cott' Imperils Grand Slams - Robin Finn, The New York Times, 29 April 1999 The term \\"girlcott\\" was revived in 2005 by women in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania protesting what they said were sexist and degrading T-shirt slogans on Abercrombie & Fitch merchandise. Notable boycotts The 1976, 1980 and 1984 Olympic boycotts Nameplate of Dr. Werner Liebenthal, Notary & Advocate. The plate was hung outside his office on Martin Luther Str, Sch√∂neberg, Berlin. In 1933, following the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service the plate was painted black by the Nazis, who boycotted Jewish owned offices. Although the term itself was not coined until 1880, the practice dates back to at least the 1790s, when supporters of the abolition of the slave trade in Britain advocated boycotting slave-produced sugar.William Fox, An Address to the People of Great Britain, on the Utility of Refraining from the Use of West India Sugar and Rum. 1791 Other instances include: * the Iranian Tobacco Boycott, 1891 * Civil Rights Movement boycotts (e.g., Montgomery & Tallahassee Bus Boycotts) * the United Farm Workers union grape and lettuce boycotts * the American boycott of British goods at the time of the American Revolution * the 1905 Chinese boycott of American products to protest the extension of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1902. * the Indian boycott of British goods organized by Mohandas Gandhi * the successful Jewish boycott organised against Henry Ford in the US, in the 1920s * the boycott of Japanese products in China after the May Fourth Movement * the antisemitic boycott of Jewish-owned businesses in Nazi Germany during the 1930s * the Jewish anti-Nazi boycott of German goods in Lithuania, the US, Britain, Poland and Mandatory Palestine during 1933 * the Arab League boycott of Israel and companies trading with Israel. * the worldwide Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign led by Palestinian civil society against the State of Israel. *The global fossil fuel divestment movement, described by Desmond Tutu as an 'apartheid-style boycott to save the planet,' and considered to be the biggest boycott-style campaign in history. During the 1973 oil crisis, the Arab countries enacted a crude oil embargo against the West. Other examples include the US-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, the Soviet-led boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and the movement that advocated \\"disinvestment\\" in South Africa during the 1980s in opposition to that country's apartheid regime. The first Olympic boycott was in the 1956 Summer Olympics with several countries boycotting the games for different reasons. Iran also has an informal Olympic boycott against participating against Israel, and Iranian athletes typically bow out or claim injuries when pitted against Israelis (see Arash Miresmaeili). Application and uses Protesters advocating boycott of BP due to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill A boycott is typically a one-time affair intended to correct an outstanding single wrong. When extended for a long period of time, or as part of an overall program of awareness-raising or reforms to laws or regimes, a boycott is part of moral purchasing, and some prefer those economic or political terms. Most organized consumer boycotts today are focused on long- term change of buying habits, and so fit into part of a larger political program, with many techniques that require a longer structural commitment, e.g. reform to commodity markets, or government commitment to moral purchasing, e.g. the longstanding boycott of South African businesses to protest apartheid already alluded to. These stretch the meaning of a \\"boycott.\\" Boycotts are now much easier to successfully initiate due to the Internet. Examples include the gay and lesbian boycott of advertisers of the \\"Dr. Laura\\" talk show, gun owners' similar boycott of advertisers of Rosie O'Donnell's talk show and (later) magazine, and gun owners' boycott of Smith & Wesson following that company's March 2000 settlement with the Clinton administration. They may be initiated very easily using either Web sites (the Dr. Laura boycott), newsgroups (the Rosie O'Donnell boycotts), or even mailing lists. Internet-initiated boycotts \\"snowball\\" very quickly compared to other forms of organization. Viral Labeling is a new boycott method using the new digital technology proposed by the Multitude Project and applied for the first time against Walt Disney around Christmas time in 2009. Another form of consumer boycotting is substitution for an equivalent product; for example, Mecca Cola and Qibla Cola have been marketed as substitutes for Coca-Cola among Muslim populations. Academic boycotts have been organized against countries. For example, the mid and late 20th century academic boycotts of South Africa in protest of apartheid practices and the more recent academic boycotts of Israel. Kwik Stop in a mostly black community. Some boycotts center on particular businesses, such as recent protests regarding Costco, Walmart, Ford Motor Company, or the diverse products of Philip Morris. Another form of boycott identifies a number of different companies involved in a particular issue, such as the Sudan Divestment campaign, the Boycott Bush campaign. The Boycott Bush website was set up by Ethical Consumer after U.S. President George W. Bush failed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol ‚Äì the website identifies Bush's corporate funders and the brands and products they produce. A prime target of boycotts is consumerism itself, e.g. \\"International Buy Nothing Day\\" celebrated globally on the Friday after Thanksgiving Day in the United States. Another version of the boycott is targeted divestment, or disinvestment. Targeted divestment involves campaigning for withdrawal of investment, for example the Sudan Divestment campaign involves putting pressure on companies, often through shareholder activism, to withdraw investment that helps the Sudanese government perpetuate genocide in Darfur. Only if a company refuses to change its behavior in response to shareholder engagement does the targeted divestment model call for divestment from that company. Such targeted divestment implicitly excludes companies involved in agriculture, the production and distribution of consumer goods, or the provision of goods and services intended to relieve human suffering or to promote health, religious and spiritual activities, or education. As a response to consumer boycotts of large-scale and multinational businesses, some companies have marketed brands that do not bear the company's name on the packaging or in advertising. Activists such as Ethical Consumer produce information that reveals which companies own which brands and products so consumers can practice boycotts or moral purchasing more effectively. Another organization, Buycott.com, provides an Internet-based smart-phone application that scans Universal Product Codes and displays corporate relationships to the user. \\"Boycotts\\" may be formally organized by governments as well. In reality, government \\"boycotts\\" are just a type of embargo. Notably, the first formal, nationwide act of the Nazi government against German Jews was a national embargo of Jewish businesses on April 1, 1933. Where the target of a boycott derives all or part of its revenues from other businesses, as a newspaper does, boycott organizers may address the target's commercial customers. When students are dissatisfied with a political or academic issue, a common tactic for students' unions is to start a boycott of classes (called a student strike among faculty and students since it is meant to resemble strike action by organized labor) to put pressure on the governing body of the institution, such as a university, vocational college or a school, since such institutions cannot afford to have a cohort miss an entire year.  Collective behavior  The sociology of collective behavior is concerned with causes and conditions pertaining to behavior carried out by a collective, as opposed to an individual (e.g., riots, panics, fads/crazes, boycotts). Boycotts have been characterized by some as different from traditional forms of collective behavior in that they appear to be highly rational and dependent on existing norms and structures. Lewis Killian criticizes that characterization, pointing to the Tallahassee bus boycott as one example of a boycott that aligns with traditional collective behavior theory. Philip Balsiger points out that political consumption (e.g., boycotts) tends to follow dual-purpose action repertoires, or scripts, which are used publicly to pressure boycott targets and to educate and recruit consumers. Balsiger finds one example in Switzerland, documenting activities of the Clean Clothes Campaign, a public NGO-backed campaign, that highlighted and disseminated information about local companies' ethical practices. Dixon, Martin, and Nau analyzed 31 collective behavior campaigns against corporations that took place during the 1990s and 2000s. Protests considered successful included boycotts and were found to include a third party, either in the capacity of state intervention or of media coverage. State intervention may make boycotts more efficacious when corporation leaders fear the imposition of regulations. Media intervention may be a crucial contributor to a successful boycott because of its potential to damage the reputation of a corporation. Target corporations that were the most visible were found to be the most vulnerable to either market (protest causing economic loss) or mediated (caused by third-party) disruption. Third-party actors (i.e., the state or media) were more influential when a corporation had a high reputation‚Äîwhen third-party activity was low, highly reputable corporations did not make the desired concessions to boycotters; when third- party activity was high, highly reputable corporations satisfied the demands of boycotters. The boycott, a prima facie market-disruptive tactic, often precipitates mediated disruption. The researchers' analysis led them to conclude that when boycott targets are highly visible and directly interact with and depend on local consumers who can easily find substitutes, they are more likely to make concessions. Koku, Akhigbe, and Springer also emphasize the importance of boycotts' threat of reputational damage, finding that boycotts alone pose more of a threat to a corporation's reputation than to its finances directly. Philippe Delacote points out that a problem contributing to a generally low probability of success for any boycott is the fact that the consumers with the most power to cause market disruption are the least likely to participate; the opposite is true for consumers with the least power. Another collective behavior problem is the difficulty, or impossibility, of direct coordination amongst a dispersed group of boycotters. Yuksel and Mryteza emphasize the collective behavior problem of free riding in consumer boycotts, noting that some individuals may perceive participating to be too great an immediate personal utility sacrifice. They also note that boycotting consumers took the collectivity into account when deciding to participate, that is, consideration of joining a boycott as goal-oriented collective activity increased one's likelihood of participating. A corporation-targeted protest repertoire including boycotts and education of consumers presents the highest likelihood for success. Legality Protesters calling for a boycott of Israel Boycotts are generally legal in developed countries. Occasionally, some restrictions may apply; for instance, in the United States, it may be unlawful for a union to engage in \\"secondary boycotts\\" (to request that its members boycott companies that supply items to an organization already under a boycott, in the United States);National Labor Relations Act, ¬ß 8(e), 29 U.S.C.A. ¬ß 158(e).Local 917, Intern. Broth. of Teamsters v. N.L.R.B., 577 F.3d 70, 75 (C.A.2, 2009). however, the union is free to use its right to speak freely to inform its members of the fact that suppliers of a company are breaking a boycott; its members then may take whatever action they deem appropriate, in consideration of that fact. =United Kingdom = When the boycott first emerged in Ireland, it presented a serious dilemma for Gladstone's government. The individual actions that constituted a boycott were recognized by legislators as essential to a free society. However, overall a boycott amounted to a harsh, extrajudicial punishment. The Prevention of Crime (Ireland) Act 1882 made it illegal to use \\"intimidation\\" to instigate or enforce a boycott, but not to participate in one. The conservative jurist James Fitzjames Stephen justified laws against boycotting by claiming that the practice amounted to \\"usurpation of the functions of government\\" and ought therefore to be dealt with as \\"the modern representatives of the old conception of high treason\\". =United States= Boycotts are legal under common law. The right to engage in commerce, social intercourse, and friendship includes the implied right not to engage in commerce, social intercourse, and friendship. Since a boycott is voluntary and nonviolent, the law cannot stop it. Opponents of boycotts historically have the choice of suffering under it, yielding to its demands, or attempting to suppress it through extralegal means, such as force and coercion. In the United States, the antiboycott provisions of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) apply to all \\"U.S. persons\\", defined to include individuals and companies located in the United States and their foreign affiliates. The antiboycott provisions are intended to prevent United States citizens and companies being used as instrumentalities of a foreign government's foreign policy. The EAR forbids participation in or material support of boycotts initiated by foreign governments, for example, the Arab League boycott of Israel. These persons are subject to the law when their activities relate to the sale, purchase, or transfer of goods or services (including the sale of information) within the United States or between the United States and a foreign country. This covers exports and imports, financing, forwarding and shipping, and certain other transactions that may take place wholly offshore. However, the EAR only applies to foreign government initiated boycotts: a domestic boycott campaign arising within the United States that has the same object as the foreign- government-initiated boycott appears to be lawful, assuming that it is an independent effort not connected with the foreign government's boycott. Other legal impediments to certain boycotts remain. One set are Refusal to deal laws, which prohibit concerted efforts to eliminate competition by refusal to buy from or to sell to a party.Business Dictionary Similarly, boycotts may also run afoul of Anti-discrimination laws; for example, New Jersey's Law Against Discrimination prohibits any place that offers goods, services and facilities to the general public, such as a restaurant, from denying or withholding any accommodation to (i.e., not to engage in commerce with) an individual because of that individual's race (etc.).New Jersey State official website  See also  * List of boycotts * Anti-boycott * Call-out culture * Cancel culture * Dollar voting * Economic secession * Election boycott * Media bias * Protest * Export restriction * Group boycott * Moral purchasing * No Platform * Non-violent resistance * Solidarity action NotesReferences * Friedman, M.

These drugs inhibit dopamine and acetylcholine esterase enzyme and have a gastrokinetic effect. Itopride is indicated for the treatment of functional dyspepsia and other gastrointestinal conditions. It is a combined D2 receptor antagonist and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Itopride is not currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States, nor is it yet approved in the United Kingdom. This may explain the apparent lack of patient information available in English compared to other similar classes of medication. Medical uses A blister package of Ganaton (Itopride) 50 mg tablets intended for distribution in the Slovak Republic. Typically, itopride is indicated in the treatment of GI symptoms caused by reduced GI motility: *dyspepsia of a non-ulcer/dysmotility type (gastric \\"fullness\\", discomfort, and possible pain) *gastroparesis (delayed gastric emptying) *anorexia *heartburn *regurgitation *bloating *nausea and vomiting *other possible gastric, prolactin, or dopamine related conditions Itopride is typically taken three times a day. The dose is usually taken on an empty stomach about an hour before meals. However, the dosage and details of administration may vary depending on the patient's age, symptoms, and other factors. Itopride was shown to significantly improve symptoms in patients with functional dyspepsia and motility disorders in placebo-controlled trials. These studies concluded that the reduction in the severity of symptoms of functional dyspepsia after 8 weeks of treatment with itopride indicated that itopride was significantly superior to placebo and that itopride yielded a greater rate of response than placebo in significantly reducing pain and fullness. Contraindications and precautions Itopride is a relatively new drug and it is not currently approved for normal prescribed use nor OTC use in either the US nor the UK. However, this does not necessarily indicate that itopride is not effective or safe. Patients taking itopride should report any side-effects to their treating physician. Itopride is contraindicated in hypersensitivity to itopride or benzamides; lactation, GI hemorrhage, obstruction or perforation. Itopride may not be indicated for those suffering from Parkinson's disease or other conditions involving dopamine regulation issues. Itopride should be used with special caution in the young and the elderly. Little information is available at this time regarding the safe use of itopride during pregnancy.  Adverse drug reactions  The most common side-effects of itopride include mild to moderate abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Some other side effects that may occur include: rash, giddiness, exhaustion, back or chest pain, increased salivation, constipation, headache, sleeping disorders, dizziness, galactorrhea, and gynecomastia. Other side effects may also be present. Leukopenia, a reduction in the normal level of white blood cells, can be a potentially life-threatening reaction to itopride. Central nervous system adverse effects do not tend to occur due to poor penetration across the blood brain barrier, although a slight raising of prolactin levels may occur. Raising of prolactin levels is more common with high dose regimes of itopride. =Cardiac studies= Itopride belongs to the same benzamide group as cisapride, a drug found to affect QT interval and possibly predispose those using it to cardiac arrhythmias. However, itopride does not have any adverse effect on the QT interval. Later, in a study conducted with healthy adult volunteers, itopride was shown as unlikely to cause cardiac arrhythmias or ECG changes in part to the lack of significant interaction and metabolism via the cytochrome P450 enzyme pathway, unlike cisapride and mosapride, as it is metabolized by a different enzyme set. New molecular studies on guinea pig ventricular myocytes also supported the cardiac safety profile of itopride, as it did not affect certain potassium mechanisms that may have been affected by cisapride or mosapride. Moreover, itopride has no affinity for the 5-HT4 receptors, unlike other benzamides such as cisapride and mosapride, which are 5-HT4 agonists. The affinity of cisapride for 5-HT4 receptors in the heart has been implicated in the undesirable cardiac effects of cisapride itself. The conclusion of this study revealed that itopride is devoid of any abnormal effect on QT interval. Therefore, it may be possible that itopride could be considered as a better and certainly safer prokinetic agent than either cisapride or mosapride, and itopride should also be considered a welcome treatment addition for symptomatic nonulcer dyspepsia and other gastric motility disorders. Pharmacology Itopride acts as a selective dual D2 receptor antagonist and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. There is evidence that itopride may have prokinetic effects throughout the gastrointestinal tract from the stomach to the end of the colon. The pharmacokinetics of itopride appear to differ between Asian and Caucasian populations, with Caucasians having 30-50 percent lower blood levels of itopride after oral administration. Itopride poorly penetrates across the blood brain barrier because of its high polarity and thus itopride does not tend to cause any central nervous system adverse effects. Itopride has no effect on potassium channels. Similarly to other D2 receptor antagonists, itopride has been found to dose-dependently increase prolactin levels. =Pharmacokinetics= After oral administration itopride undergoes rapid and extensive absorption with levels of itopride peaking in the blood plasma after only 35 minutes. Itopride is primarily eliminated via the kidneys having an elimination half-life of approximately 6 hours. =Mechanism of action= Ganaton (Itopride) 50 mg tablets. Engraving says \\"HC 803\\" Itopride increases acetylcholine concentrations by inhibiting dopamine D2 receptors and acetylcholinesterase. Higher acetylcholine increases GI peristalsis, increases the lower esophageal sphincter pressure, stimulates gastric motility, accelerates gastric emptying, and improves gastro-duodenal coordination. Itopride given as a single dose study found that it also raises levels of motilin, somatostatin and lowers levels of cholecystokinin, as well as adrenocorticotropic hormone. These effects may also contribute to itopride's pharmacology.  Interactions  Anticholinergic agents reduce the action of itopride. It is worth noting that itopride is a relatively new drug and that it is, therefore, possible that other drugs may interact with itopride, rendering contraindications or side effects that are not currently known. Trade names Itopride is available under the brand names Ganaton ((JP, CZ, RU), Abbott Laboratories), Itomed ((RU, KR, UA, MD), PRO.MED.CS Praha a.s.), Itogard (Apex Pharmaceuticals, Nepal) and others. In Mexico, itopride (50 mg) is sold by Takeda Laboratories under the brand name Dagla.

It was the last acting role of Charlotte Coleman before she died.  Plot  Ruby and Garnet are identical twins, who once lived with their Dad and their Gran in Birmingham. Their mother, Opal died a few years earlier. They are happy together, but then Dad gets a new girlfriend, Rose. The twins and Gran hate her. Dad decides to make things worse for them when he loses his job. He sends Gran to a Senior Citizens' Home and takes his three girls to the country, to open a bookshop. The bookshop more or less fails. The twins make enemies with a fat boy called Jeremy who they nickname \\"Blob\\" and his gang. Garnet also makes a new friend called Judy. Because they totally loathe their new life, they do everything bad at school to get expelled so that they can go back to Birmingham and then regret it. They apologise to Dad and make him biscuits. Whilst doing this, Ruby comes across a Newspaper Advert for an audition for a Television adaptation of the novel \\"The Terrible Tempest Twins,\\". Garnet isn't keen but Ruby insists on asking Dad. So Ruby steals money from Rose as well as telling Garnet to sell their grandmother's doll for ¬£20 and forcing Garnet to go to Birmingham with her to the audition. The casting director (played by Double Act's author Jacqueline Wilson) is very impressed with Ruby and Garnet but Dad finds them and takes them home. When they are watching the news that night, Ruby appears on TV giving a quick wave to the camera. Then they show the filming location, a boarding school called Marnock Heights. Ruby insists on writing a letter to the headteacher, to try to get Garnet and her a place. They get a reply with a brochure. Then they realize that it costs ¬£10,000, unless they get a scholarship. They sit an entrance exam, but only one girl can get the scholarship. Ruby is so confident that it's her, that when Garnet gets the place, she goes on a hateful resentment towards her, desperate to be different. Garnet copies her to be her twin, and then Ruby loses the rag completely and violently chops off her pigtails. She won't talk to Garnet at all and then the day comes when Garnet is going to Marnock Heights, when Ruby suddenly regrets her actions and apologizes. They make up and Garnet later calls her with her new mobile and everything is brilliant, considering she was really nervous beforehand.

He opposed the deliberate inclusion of the Kapu caste in backward castes by the state government. He criticised the action, quoting \\"Constituent Assembly had made it clear that economic backwardness was not the only to consider castes as backward castes. The caste groups should be identified by trades to qualify as backward castes. The principle of shudras and non-shudras should form the basis of dividing the castes\\".

Medical uses It is used in Japan, South Korea, and China to treat asthma, keloid scars, and hypertrophic scars, and as an ophthalmic solution for allergic pink eye. It should not be taken by women who are or might become pregnant, and it is secreted in breast milk.  Interactions  People who are taking warfarin should not also take tranilast, as they interact. It appears to inhibit UGT1A1 so will interfere with metabolism of drugs that are affected by that enzyme. Adverse effects When given systemically, tranilast appears to cause liver damage; in a large well- conducted clinical trial it caused elevated transaminases three times the upper limit of normal in 11 percent of patients, as well as anemia, kidney failure, rash, and problems urinating. Given systemically it inhibits blood formation, causing leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Society and culture As of March 2018 it was marketed in Japan, China, and South Korea under the brand names Ao Te Min, Arenist, Brecrus, Garesirol, Hustigen, Krix, Lumios, Rizaben, Tramelas, Tranilast, and it was marketed as a combination drug with salbutamol under the brand name Shun Qi.

It has been shown to inhibit the release of many cytokines in various cell types, in in vitro studies. It has also been shown to inhibit NALP3 inflammasome activation and is being studied as a treatment for NALP3-driven inflammatory diseases. Chemistry Tranilast is an analog of a metabolite of tryptophan, and its chemical name is 3‚Ä≤,4‚Ä≤-dimethoxycinnamoyl) anthranilic acid (N-5‚Ä≤). It is almost insoluble in water, easily soluble in dimethylsulfoxide, soluble in dioxane, and very slightly soluble in ether. It is photochemically unstable in solution. Research After promising results in three small clinical trials, tranilast was studied in a major clinical trial (the PRESTO trial) by SmithKline Beecham in partnership with Kissei for prevention of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary revascularization, but was not found effective for that application. As of 2016, Altacor was developing a formulation of tranilast to prevent of scarring following glaucoma surgery and had obtained an orphan designation from the EMA for this use. History It was developed by Kissei and first approved in Japan and South Korea for asthma in 1982, and approved uses for keloid and hypertrophic scars were added later in the 1980s.

Despite limited success at county level, Clara has produced several hurlers who have gone on to enjoy inter-county success with Kilkenny. Jim Langton was born in the area, a winner of All-Ireland medals in 1939 and 1947, and a place on the GAA Hurling Team of the Century chosen in 1984. More recently, Paddy Prendergast was a fixture in the Cats' defence in the 1970s and 1980s, winning three All-Ireland medals and three National Hurling League Medals. Harry Ryan played in the Kilkenny forward line in the 1980s, winning an All-Ireland medal in 1983. Lester Ryan is another all- Ireland winner, nephew of his namesake Lester Ryan who played with the Cats in the 1980s. Lester Ryan had the great honour of Captaining Kilkenny to All- Ireland Success in 2015, making one of the best acceptance speeches (totally in Irish) ever heard in Croke Park. Shane Prendergast (son of Paddy Prendergast) was the captain of the Kilkenny Senior Team in 2016.

Alexander Frederik de Savornin Lohman (29 May 1837 ‚Äì 11 June 1924) was a Dutch politician and leader of the Christian Historical Union during the first quarter of the 20th century. He was a member of the lower Dutch nobility and held the predicate of jonkheer. He was born into a family of Walloon Reformed extraction. During his studies he became a supporter of the anti-revolutionary cause of Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer and he was elected to the Dutch House of Representatives for the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) in 1879. He remained a member of parliament until 1921. Throughout his career he would serve as member of the House of Representatives, member of the Senate and, for a short while, minister. He was noted for his vehement attacks against his opponents, but was generally considered to be receptive of the arguments of his peers. De Savornin Lohman got involved in politics whilst serving as a judge at the court of 's-Hertogenbosch. There he became party to a conflict over Christian schools. He soon met Abraham Kuyper, another anti-revolutionary politician who would dominate Dutch politics in the years to come. When Kuyper was suffering from burnout in 1876 and 1877 De Savornin Lohman replaced him as chief editor of the Standaard, the anti-revolutionary newspaper. De Savornin Lohman went on, at times reluctantly, to become Kuyper's most important collaborator in his many projects (the School Struggle, the foundation of the Anti Revolutionary Party in 1879, the Doleantie in 1886 and the creation of the Free University of Amsterdam in 1879). De Savornin Lohman's entry in politics coincided with the introduction of party discipline into Dutch politics. As an aristocrat De Savornin Lohman was torn between the opinion of his fellow aristocrats, who considered politics to be a personal thing, and the opinion of his leader and friend Kuyper, who found party discipline and the democratic process of the utmost importance. Further conflict ensued when De Savornin Lohman became Minister of the Interior, replacing √Üneas Mackay, who in turn replaced Keuchenius as Minister of Colonial Affairs. The Dutch parliament had refused supply to Keuchenius's budget and Mackay wanted to save the government. Kuyper wanted to have a general election and sought the fall of the government. De Savornin Lohman and most of the Anti Revolutionary Party supported the government. Two factions in the ARP now emerged, one led by Kuyper the other by De Savornin Lohman. When the liberal minister Tak van Poortvliet presented a proposal to introduce universal suffrage in 1893, this proved to be an especially divisive issue. The aristocrat De Savornin Lohman was against extension, while Kuyper saw an electoral advantage for the ARP. Universal suffrage would give the vote to orthodox Protestant farmers and small entrepreneurs (collectively referred to in Dutch political science as kleine luyden), who had hitherto been ineligible because of the minimum taxes requirement. When Kuyper managed to persuade ARP members to support his position, De Savornin Lohman's faction, the Free Anti Revolutionaries (VAR), became directly opposed to Kuyper's Anti Revolutionaries. The conflict led to a split in the ARP with De Savornin Lohman and his largely aristocratic colleagues forming the smaller splinter group. In 1908, after a series of mergers with like-minded political groups, De Savornin Lohman and his VAR founded the Christian Historical Union (CHU). Religiously, De Savornin Lohman, who was Reformed, was personally involved in the schism called the Doleantie, which was led by Kuyper. The schism was a reaction against the progressive practices of the Dutch Reformed Church and De Savornin Lohman went on to become a member of the newly founded Reformed Churches in the Netherlands. While Kuyper favoured cooperation with Roman Catholics in parliament, De Savornin Lohman and his fellow Anti Revolutionaries were sceptical towards Roman Catholicism. Professionally, De Savornin Lohman was employed by the Free University of Amsterdam to teach law and a Reformed outlook on science. In 1895 the conflict with Kuyper forced him to resign his post. It was twenty years before the two gentlemen were on speaking terms again. In 1896 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, he resigned from the Academy in 1914. In 1902 he acted as one of five arbitrators at The Hague in the Pious Fund of the Californias dispute between the United States and Mexico, the first dispute between states arbitrated by the Permanent Court of Arbitration. He also sat on the panel for the Sarvarkar Case in 1911. Alexander de Savornin Lohman died in The Hague aged 87. He was an important adviser to Queen Wilhelmina.

The house is currently a part of the John Michael Kohler Arts Center complex. History The house was constructed in 1882 by John Michael Kohler (1844‚Äì1900), a past mayor of Sheboygan and founder of the Kohler Company. No documentary record of the house's architect has been found. Family tradition recalls that John Michael Kohler, himself, designed the house. This is plausible, because it is known that other members of the Kohler family in Austria engaged in architecture, including John Michael's father, whose design of a small church survives. An extensive addition and remodel was completed in 1920. At the time the house was occupied by his second wife, Wilhemina Minnie Vollrath (1842-1929) and four of his children Evangeline (1872-1954), Marie (1876-1943), Lillie (1877-1965), and Herbert Sr (1891-1968). Ownership of the house was transferred to the Kohler Foundation in the will of Evangeline Kohler in 1954 with a life estate for her sister Lillie. The Sheboygan Arts Foundation, Inc. was created in 1959 and its first board included Mrs. Walter J. Kohler III. In 1966, after the death of Lillie Kohler in 1965, the Kohler Foundation gifted the house to the Sheboygan Arts Foundation, Inc. for the use of the arts center.

The house is a two-story brick veneered structure on a coursed limestone foundation capped with an iron water table. Plan and massing are asymmetrical with projecting pavilions on all facades. The east facing pavilion contains a two-story bay. The roofline is gently pitched and had projecting gables with heavy eaves and cornices and with returns suggestive of a classical pediment. The eaves have carved and scroll cut brackets with turned pendants. The main facade gable is pierced with a bull's-eye window. Windows have round arches with distinctive cast iron keystones that may have been made in the Kohler foundry. The arches are supported on pilasters with decorative iron capitals and bases footed on iron sills. A projecting single story porch facing both the front walk and the driveway to the left dominates the southwest corner of the house and shelters the main entrance. Single story porches are also found on the southeast and northeast corners of the house, although the southeast porch was enclosed in the 1920s remodeling. At this time Victorian porch columns and gingerbread were replaced with heavier hexagonal columns and cornice, but original cast iron cresting still crowns each porch. The original main floor plan formed an asymmetrical cross with parlors dominating the front and center portions and dining room, study, and kitchens occupying the rear and west pavilions. The parlors were separated by massive sliding doors. Most essential features of the plan, as well as the sliding doors, decorative cove moulding in the parlors, and the staircase were retained in the 1920s remodeling. The iron gazebo and the fountain, which features a cast zinc sculpture depicting three children with a dolphin are original to the house, although they were relocated in the remodeling. The gazebo and the fountain sculpture may have been made at the Kohler foundry. The 1920s remodeling did not greatly alter the exterior appearance of the house. The southeast porch was enclosed with windows and panels to provide a sunroom adjacent to the front parlor. The east bay was raised a third story to create a penthouse bedroom, and the rear-facing pavilion was extended in a two-story bay, These additions were finished with stucco in a muted Mediterranean Revival fashion and in sympathy with the original architecture of the house. The fenestration of the west-facing pavilion and back part of the west facade was altered to accommodate remodeling of the dining room and to increase the lighting of the master bedroom above it. On the interior, the remodeling was more thoroughgoing and utilized accepted Italian motifs of the Eclectic Resurgence. The interior has been little altered in the building's reuse. Victorian wall finishes were replaced with textured plaster painted in cream tones. The dining room was relocated to the west facing pavilion and decorated with oak paneling, ceiling beams, built-in cabinets and sideboards, and a massive table and chairs. Casement windows and cabinet doors are of decorative stained and leaded glass designed by Kaspar Albrecht. Flooring is of decorative Moravian tile from Henry Mercer's Pennsylvania factory. The room and its furnishings are preserved as the formal meeting room of the arts center. Moravian tile and Albrecht glass were'also employed in the new north facing bay, which became a part of the relocated study. The bay also features a characteristic vaulted ceiling and a carved stone fireplace. Moravian tile was also used in the upstairs hall, the master bedroom, and the redecorated main fireplace. The master bedroom has casement windows of Albrecht glass.

Cheung previously served as the Secretary for Labour and Welfare for ten years. He was awarded the Grand Bauhinia Medal (GBM) by the Hong Kong SAR Government in 2017. Biography Cheung was born in Hong Kong in 1950. He graduated from the University of Hong Kong in 1972, then became an Information Officer for the then British colonial government. During the Vietnamese refugee crisis of the 1970s, he was responsible for arranging visits for foreign media to the refugee camps. He was transferred to the Administrative Service in September 1979 and has served in various bureaus and departments in the government. During his earlier years of service, he served in the Finance Branch, Home Affairs Department, City and New Territories Administration, Government House and the Industry Department. As a directorate officer since 1986, Cheung served as District Officer of North District, Assistant Director- General of Trade, Administrative Assistant to the Financial Secretary, Deputy Judiciary Administrator, and Deputy Head of Central Policy Unit. He was promoted to Deputy Secretary for Education and Manpower (1996‚Äì1999), Commissioner for Labour (1999‚Äì2000), Director of Education (2000‚Äì2002), and Permanent Secretary for Economic Development and Labour (later known as Permanent Secretary for Economic Development/Commissioner for Labour; 2002‚Äì2007). He was promoted to Administrative Officer Staff Grade A1 in September 2004. Cheung was known for his hardworking style, having taken less than three weeks off in the five years leading up to his retirement in March 2007 as Permanent Secretary for Economic Development and Labour. In July 2007, he was appointed Secretary for Labour and Welfare, one of the principal officials. During his tenure, he oversaw the minimum wage legislation and Work Incentive Transport Subsidy Scheme introduced in 2011. He also tackled issues such as the Old Age Living Allowance, standard working hours and paternity leave, all of which are still fiercely debated over by unionists and employers with opposing views. He was criticised for his low profile during the 2013 Hong Kong dock strike. He was also criticised for only taking orders from his superiors and not taking responsibility for decisions. In January 2017, he became the Chief Secretary for Administration, replacing Carrie Lam. On September 1, 2019 in the midst of protests against the government of Hong Kong he wrote that ‚ÄúSchools are places for learning, and are absolutely not places for expressing political views or demands.‚Äù In October 2020, Cheung stated that the government will not allow schools to become \\"breeding grounds\\" for Hong Kong independence, and that the Education Bureau must protect students from those \\"twisted and illegal\\" ideas. In addition, Cheung said that teachers should train students to become \\"responsible and good citizens and nationals, who contribute to the long-term stability of the country and the community.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Mr Matthew Cheung Kin-chung biodata 1950 births Living people Alumni of the University of Hong Kong Government officials of Hong Kong Chief Secretaries of Hong Kong Members of the Executive Council of Hong Kong Hong Kong civil servants Hong Kong politicians Recipients of the Gold Bauhinia Star Recipients of the Grand Bauhinia Medal Hong Kong people of Hakka descent People from Huiyang ","title":"Matthew Cheung"},{"id":"18592471","title":"Swimming at the 1997 European Aquatics Championships ‚Äì Men's 1500 metre freestyle"},{"id":"18592477","text":"Will McKenzie is the protagonist and narrator from the E4 coming-of-age British comedy The Inbetweeners, played by Simon Bird, who made his first appearance during the pilot episode \\"First Day\\", broadcast on 1 May 2008. The character narrates a majority of the scenes in each of the three main series and is often cited as the lead character. Directors named the character in homage to the gameshow \\"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire\\". In episode 1 of series 1 of the quiz the first contestant to be introduced on fastest finger first by then host Chris Tarrant was a man called \\"William McKenzie\\". Will appears in every episode of the series, as well as appearing in the follow-up films The Inbetweeners Movie (2011) and The Inbetweeners 2 (2014). Appearances=Television series= Will moves from a private school to a state comprehensive school because his mother, Polly McKenzie (Belinda Stewart- Wilson), can no longer afford to pay the tuition fees. Upon moving to the new school, Simon Cooper (Joe Thomas), Jay Cartwright (James Buckley) and Neil Sutherland (Blake Harrison) reluctantly become Will's new friends after initially trying to avoid him. The group warm to him after several efforts to win their friendship ‚Äì including successfully buying alcohol underage and (almost) having sex with the most attractive girl in the school. He is an unconventional hero ‚Äì although he is generally the wittiest and most level- headed of the group, he is prone to making bad decisions, easily giving in to peer pressure, and making outrageous remarks. He is generally sophisticated, sensible and possesses intelligence that surpasses that of his immediate friends. Another dominant characteristic, is his tendency to deliver sarcastic, dry humorous remarks, which sometimes get him into trouble. Will also appears to follow certain ethical laws, though is not above occasionally committing illegal acts, such as buying alcohol underage, and inadvertently or accidentally making insults, such as against Neil's father Kevin Sutherland (Alex Macqueen) while drunk and people who are disabled, among others. Simon Bird plays Will McKenzie Will aspires to have a career in law or maybe the media, and was supposed to be attending a local newspaper office for work experience. However, a mix-up with applications sends Neil to the newspaper office (instead of \\"driving aeroplanes\\") and Will spends his placement at a garage, where he ultimately fails to fit in and gets bullied by the staff working there. At the end of the second series, when the boys face exams, Will began to crack under pressure and relies on energy drinks to keep him awake- believing that if he doesn't sleep he can spend more time revising. This plan unfortunately backfires, leading to him soiling himself during his final exam, and after completing it several hours late, he goes to the pub and downs three pints of lager, compensating for the fact that he has probably failed his Politics AS level. He is interested in Charlotte Hinchcliffe (Emily Atack), and the two of them have been known to spend time together, with Will accidentally ruining their relationship. He nearly lost his virginity to Charlotte after telling her in school a few days prior that he had had numerous lovers, although when they did attempt to have sex, Charlotte was let down by Will's unsuccessful attempt; in his own words \\"rubbing up against the perineum\\". In Series 3, Will is convinced to go on a double date with Simon, Tara Brown (Hannah Tointon), and Tara's friend, Kerry (or \\"Big Kerry\\" according to Will). He is repulsed by her as she is taller than he is, and is rather ditzy and boring; however once he hears how she is known for fellating her last few boyfriends, he continues his relationship with her. They unexpectedly share a kiss when Kerry escorts him back home, which gives her the impression that they are now dating. At Neil's eighteenth birthday party, Will causes outrage by attempting to harshly break-up with Kerry, not knowing that her father had died a month previously, and that Tara had arranged their relationship to comfort her. Will later attempts to arrange a final camping holiday with the lads before they go their separate ways after leaving school. Will is the only character out of the four to never pass his driving test; this is in large part due to the fact his mother did not sign him up for driving lessons on his 17th birthday as she thought the minimum age was 18. Will serves as the narrator in the show and is therefore the principal character. =Films= In The Inbetweeners Movie, the group go on holiday to Malia, Crete after leaving school, where Will meets Alison, a woman with a similar personality to him. Despite Alison initially acting distant towards Will's advances, owing to the fact that she already has a boyfriend, they become closer and she suggests they go skinny dipping one night. At the beach the following night, Alison strips naked in front of Will, imploring him to do the same before placing his hand on her breast, and they appear to be growing closer until she catches her boyfriend having sex with another woman and runs off crying. They ultimately reconcile at a boat party later that week, where Alison admits to Will that she really likes him. Will affirms that he likes her as well and they begin a relationship. In the second film, Will reveals that he has \\"been dumped\\". He appears to be single in that film. He is shown to be an unpopular student at Bristol University, but has used his time alone to become a surprisingly accomplished guitar player. He attempts to seduce Katie Evans, an old friend from prep school, by singing \\"Killing Me Softly with His Song\\" with his guitar, but she passes out drunk whilst he is fingering her. Reception For his portrayal as Will, Bird has won the 2008 British Comedy Award for \\"Best Male Newcomer\\" and the 2009 British Comedy Award for \\"Best Actor\\". He was also nominated for \\"Best Comedy Performance\\" at the 2008 Royal Television Society Awards, and \\"Best Male Performance\\" in a Comedy Programme at the 2009 BAFTA Awards. While The Inbetweeners Movie received mixed reviews from American critics, Bird's performance was met with praise. Steve Rose of The Guardian gave the film three stars out of five, giving particular praise to Simon Bird's performance and arguing that the film \\"updates the teen summer holiday formula surprisingly entertainingly, considering it doesn't subvert its one iota and the formula was already done previously with Holiday on the Buses and Kevin & Perry Go Large among others.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Will McKenzie at All 4.co.uk Television characters introduced in 2008 Male characters in television Teenage characters in television Comedy film characters Fictional cannabis users ","title":"Will McKenzie"},{"id":"18592480","title":"One Missed Call (TV series)"},{"id":"18592485","text":"Wuxi dialect (Simplified Chinese: Êó†Èî°ËØù; Traditional Chinese: ÁÑ°Èå´Ë©±; Pinyin: W√∫xƒ´ hu√†, Wu : mu1 sik1 wo3 , Wuxi dialect : [vuÀ®À®Àß si…™ îÀ¶ …¶uÀ®]) is a dialect of Wu.

Oehme was born in Wiesbaden, Germany as the son of Dr. Reinhold Oehme and Katharina Kraus. In 1952, in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, he married Mafalda Pisani, who was born in Berlin as the daughter of Giacopo Pisani and Wanda d'Alfonso. Mafalda died in Chicago in August of the year 2004. Education and career Completing the Abitur at the Rheingau Gymnasium in Geisenheim near Wiesbaden, Oehme started to study physics and mathematics at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main,http://inspirehep.net/author/profile/R.Oehme.1 receiving the Diploma in 1948 as student of Erwin Madelung.HTML See third last paragraph; translation of relevant passage: ‚ÄúAs Friedrich Hund found out, directly after the war MADELUNG had particularly capable students and collaborators.

Later this year, Heisenberg asked him to join Carl Friedrich von Weizs√§cker on a trip to Brazil for the start-up of the Instituto de F√≠sica Te√≥rica in S√£o Paulo,http://www.ift.unesp.br/ (See Institui√ß√£o, HIST√ìRICO, third paragraph) considered also as a possible escape in view of the tense situation in Europe. In 1953, he returned to his assistant position at the Max Planck Institute in G√∂ttingen. During the early fifties, the Institute was a most interesting place. Oehme was there among an exceptional group of people around Heisenberg, including Vladimir Glaser, Rolf Hagedorn, Fritz Houtermans, Gerhard L√ºders, Walter Thirring, Kurt Symanzik, Carl Friedrich von Weizsaecker, Wolfhart Zimmermann, Bruno Zumino, who all have made important contributions to physics at some time. A year later, with Heisenberg's recommendation to his friend Enrico Fermi, Oehme was offered a research associate position at the University of Chicago, where he worked at the Institute for Nuclear Studies. Publications associated with this period are described below under Work. In the fall of 1956, he moved to Princeton as a member of the Institute for Advanced Study, (See page 297) returning in 1958 to the University of Chicago as a professor in the Department of Physics and at the Enrico Fermi Institute for Nuclear Studies. In 1998, he became professor emeritus. * Visiting Professor Positions*: University of Maryland, College Park, 1957; Universit√§t Wien, Austria 1961; Imperial College, London1963-64; Universit√§t Karlsruhe, Germany, 1974, 1975, 1977; University of Tokyo, Japan, 1976, 1988; Research Institute of Fundamental Physics, University of Kyoto, Japan, 1976. * Visiting Positions*: Instituto de F√≠sica Te√≥rica, S√£o Paulo, Brasil; Brookhaven National Laboratory; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; CERN, Geneva, Switzerland; International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Miramare-Trieste, Italy; Max Planck Institute for Physics, M√ºnchen, Germany. * Awards*: Guggenheim Fellow, 1963‚Äì64; with photo Humboldt Price, 1974; Fellowship of the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) 1976, 1988. * Honors: The University of Chicago offers annually the Enrico Fermi, Robert R.

He found that particle-particle and antiparticle- particle amplitudes are connected by analytic continuation in the complex energy plane. These results led to the paper by him with Marvin L. Goldberger and Hironari Miyazawa on the dispersion relations for pion-nucleon scattering, which also contains the Goldberger-Miyazawa-Oehme Sum Rule. M. L. Goldberger, H. Miyazawa, and R.

The analytic connection Oehme found between particle and antiparticle amplitudes is the first example of a fundamental feature of local quantum field theory: the crossing property. It is proven here, in a non-perturbative setting, on the basis of the analytic properties of amplitudes which are a consequence of locality and spectrum, like the dispersion relations. For generalizations, one still relies mostly on perturbation theory. For the purpose of using the powerful methods of the theory of functions of several complex variables for the proof of non-forward dispersion relations, and for analytic properties of other Greens functions, Oehme formulated and proved a fundamental theorem which he called the ‚ÄúEdge of the Wedge Theorem‚Äù (‚ÄúKeilkanten Theorem‚Äù). This work was done mainly in the Fall of 1956 at the Institute for Advanced Study in collaboration with Hans- Joachim Bremermann and John G. Taylor. H. J. Bremermann, R. Oehme and J.G. Taylor, ‚ÄúUNE DEMONSTRATION POSSIBLE DES RELATIONS DE DISPERSION‚Äù presented at Les Problemes Mathematiques de la Theorie Quantique des Champs, Colloques Internationaux du CNRS, Lille, France, 3-8 Juin 1957, printed in Colloques Internationaux du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, LXXV, 169 (1959).H.J. Bremermann, R. Oehme and J.G. Taylor , Phys.Rev.109(1958) 2178 ‚ÄúProof of Dispersion Relations in Quantized Field Theories‚Äù; Appendix: ‚ÄúThe Edge of the Wedge Theorem‚Äù. (This paper contains references to the work of Nikolay Bogoliubov and others.) Using microscopic causality and spectral properties, the BOT theorem provides an initial region of analyticity, which can be enlarged by \\"Analytic Completion\\". Oehme first presented these results at the Princeton University Colloquium during the winter semester 1956/57. Independently, a different and elaborate proof of non-forward dispersion relations has been published by Nikolay Bogoliubov and collaborators. N. N. Bogoliubov and D. V. Shirkov, \\"Introduction to the Theory of Quantized Fields\\", John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated 1959, / 9780471042235. The Edge of the Wedge Theorem of BOT has many other applications. For example, it can be used to show that, in the presence of (spontaneous) violations of Lorentz invariance, micro-causality (locality), together with positivity of the energy, implies Lorentz invariance of the energy- momentum spectrum.H.J. Borchers (Dec 1984) \\"Locality and Covariance of the Spectrum\\", Fizika 17:289-304,1985 and references given there. Together with Marvin L. Goldberger and Yoichiro Nambu, Oehme also has formulated dispersion relations for nucleon-nucleon scattering.Marvin L. Goldberger, Yoichiro Nambu and Reinhard Oehme,, Ann.Phys.(N.Y.) 2:226(1957) \\"Dispersion Relations for Nucleon-Nucleon Scattering.\\" In accordance with the results of Oehme about the analytic continuation of amplitudes, these relations contain integrals involving nucleon-nucleon and nucleon-antinucleon total cross sections, as well as absolute squares of annihilation amplitudes. =Charge Conjugation Non- Conservation= On August 7, 1956, Oehme wrote a letter Yang, C.N. (1983). Selected papers 1945-1980, with commentary (Chen Ning Yang), p.32, 33. W.H. Freeman, San Francisco 1983. . to C.N. Yang in which it is shown that weak interactions must violate charge conjugation conservation in the event of a positive outcome of the polarization experiment in beta-decay. Since parity conservation leads to the same restrictions, he points out that C and P must BOTH be violated in order to get an asymmetry. Hence, at the level of ordinary weak interactions, CP is the relevant symmetry, and not C and P individually. Coulomb distortions of the electron wave function can be experimentally separated due to their Z and p dependence. Violation of C is one of the fundamental conditions Andrei Sakharov, Pisma Zh. Eksp. Teor. Fiz. 5 (1967), 32 for the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe. The results of Oehme form the basis for the later experimental effort to study CP Symmetry, and the fundamental discovery of non-conservation at a lower level of interaction strength. J.H. Christensen, J. Cronin, V.F. Fitch, and R. Turlay Phys. Rev. Lett. 13, 138 - 140 (1964) ‚ÄúEvidence for the 2œÄ Decay of the K20 Meson‚Äù.James W. Cronin Rev. Mod.

Prompted by the letter, T D Lee, R Oehme and C N Yang provided a detailed discussion of the interplay of non-invariance under P, C and T, and of applications to the Kaon - anti-Kaon complex.T.D.

Advanced Study) , Phys.Rev.106:340-345,1957. ‚ÄúRemarks on Possible Noninvariance Under Time Reversal and Charge Conjugation.‚Äù Their results are of importance for the description of the CP violation discovered later. In their paper the authors already consider non-invariance under T (time reversal) and hence, given the assumption of CPT symmetry, also under CP. =Propagators and OZ Superconvergence Relations= In connection with an exact structure analysis for gauge theory propagators, undertaken by Oehme in collaboration with Wolfhart Zimmermann, Reinhard Oehme, Wolfhart Zimmermann (Chicago U., EFI & Chicago U. & Munich, Max Planck Inst.)

These \\"Oehme-Zimmernann Relations\\" provide a link between long- and short- distance properties of the theory. They are of importance for gluon confinement.Reinhard Oehme, MPI-PAE-PTH-39-90, EFI-90-50, Jul 1990. 34pp. , Phys.Rev.D42:4209-4221,1990. \\"Renormalization group, BRST cohomology, and the problem of confinement\\". (This paper contains references to the work of K. Nishijima and others.) These results about propagators depend essentially only upon general principles. =Reduction of Quantum Field Theories= As a general method of imposing restrictions on quantum field theories with several parameters, Oehme and Zimmermann have introduced a theory of reduction of coupling constants.Reinhard Oehme, Wolfhart Zimmermann, MPI-PAE/PTh 60/82, , Commun.Math.Phys.97:569,1985 \\"Relation Between Effective Couplings for Asymptotically Free Models\\".

There are solutions of the reduction equations which do not correspond to additional symmetries, but may be related to other characteristic aspects of the theory. On the other hand, supersymmetric theories do come out as possible solutions. This is an important example for the appearance of supersymmetry without imposing it explicitly. The reduction theory is finding many applications, theoreticalFor example: Reinhard Oehme, Talk given at Ringberg Symposium on Quantum Field Theory, Ringberg Castle, Germany, 21-24 Jun 1998. Lect.

Biography Kirshenblatt was born in Apt (Yiddish)/ Opat√≥w (Polish) Poland. He left Poland in 1934 and settled in Toronto, Canada, where he ran a paint and wallpaper store for many years. In 2007, he and his daughter Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett published They Called Me Mayer July: Painted Memories of a Jewish Childhood before the Holocaust (University of California Press in conjunction with the Judah L Magnes Museum). The book won the Canadian Jewish Book Award, J. I. Segal Book Award, and American Association of University Presses (AAUP) award for book design, and was a finalist in three categories for the National Jewish Book Award. An exhibition of his work, which opened at the Magnes Museum in 2007, will travel to The Jewish Museum (New York City), Jewish Historical Museum (Amsterdam), and Museum of the History of Polish Jews (Warsaw). The book and exhibition are the culmination of a forty-year collaboration between father and daughter. In 1967, Barbara began interviewing Mayer about his childhood.

Life The daughter of an Italian officer, she spent her childhood in Ethiopia and Eritrea, where her father was stationed. After World War II, she studied classics at the University of Messina, where she obtained her degree in classics in 1953. An archaeology scholarship and Fulbright Travel Grant allowed her to continue her studies at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, where she came under the tutelage of Rhys Carpenter. At the end of her MA, she wrote her thesis on Archaic sculpture at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. She received her Ph.D in 1958 and returned as a teacher to Bryn Mawr, where she spent most of her career. In 1977 she was named Rhys Carpenter Professor of Classical and Near Eastern Archaeology, which she held until her retirement in 1994.

Views and opinions Brunilde Ridgway is, in keeping with her mentor Rhys Carpenter, a follower of the radical questioning of the Meisterforschung, or search for the masterpiece or archetype that inspired a replica series, that dominated the history of Greek art since Adolf Furtw√§ngler. Elaborating on Carpenter's remark that Greek sculpture is ‚Äúthe anonymous product of an impersonal craft,‚ÄùCarpenter, Greek sculpture.

The Doleantie was not the first schism in the Dutch Reformed Church. In 1834 another schism, the Secession of 1834 (Afscheiding van 1834), had led to the formation of the Christian Reformed Church in the Netherlands (Christelijke Gereformeerde Kerk in Nederland). In 1885 the first moves towards schism were made when Kuyper and his supporters issued a formal complaint about liberalizing practices in the Dutch Reformed Church. Their complaint never won broad support within the church, and in the winter of 1885-1886 the call for schism grew stronger amongst a large number of conservative congregations, most of which were located in the Veluwe area and elsewhere in what is today the Dutch Bible Belt. The first congregation to secede was Kootwijk, on February 7, 1886 appointed a minister trained at the Free University of Amsterdam without waiting for permission of its classis. The following day the congregation in Voorthuizen followed suit. The seceded congregations united in the Low German Reformed Church (Dolerende) (Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk (Dolerende)). Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk had been the official name of the Dutch Reformed Church until 1816 and with this name the seceded churches wanted to show that they thought of themselves as the legitimate continuation of this church, which was highly prominent in the Dutch Republic. The suffix (Dolerende), meaning 'those who feel sorrow', was added to show their disapproval with the Dutch Reformed Church. Later in 1886 Kuyper and his supporters occupied the New Church in Amsterdam, the seat of the governing body of the Reformed Church, to force a settlement in the conflict over church property that had followed the Doleantie. In July 1886 the dolerenden had to accept a verdict against them. In 1892 the Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerken (Dolerende) merged with the Christian Reformed Church in the Netherlands to form the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands.

In Israeli law, an outpost (, Ma'ahaz lit. \\"a handhold\\") is an unauthorized or illegal Israeli settlement within the West Bank, constructed without the required authorization from the Israeli government in contravention of Israeli statutes regulating planning and construction. In Israeli law, outposts are distinguished from settlements authorized by the Israeli government. This distinction between illegal outposts and \\"legal\\" settlements is not endorsed by international law, which considers both a violation of the norms, governing belligerent occupations, applicable to the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Outposts appeared after the 1993 Oslo I Accord, when the Israeli government made commitments to freeze the building of new settlements. Although outposts were not officially supported by the government, Israeli public authorities and other government bodies played a major role in establishing and developing them, according to the 2005 Sasson Report, commissioned by then Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. Outposts differ from neighborhoods in that they are built at a substantial distance from authorized settlements, while neighborhoods are attached to an existing settlement. In July 2002, the Israeli government acknowledged that 69 outposts had been established since 1996. A number of them, most unpopulated, have been removed afterwards. Currently, some hundred outposts exist.Peace Now, Data-sheet Settlements and Outposts Numbers and Data , at Settlements and Outposts The majority of them, some 70 in 2002, belong to the Amana movement. In 2012, ten unauthorized outposts were retroactively legalised by the Israeli government under Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu, according to the Israeli NGO Peace Now, by redesignating them as a neighbourhood of nearby settlements. Outposts often are provided with security by the Israel Defense Forces.  Background  In 1993, the Rabin Government made commitments to freeze the building of new settlements. After then, however, settlers built new settlements without governmental decision, but often with the involvement of Israeli public authorities and other government bodies and government ministries, such as the Ministry of Housing and Construction, the Settlement Division of the World Zionist Organization and the Israeli Civil Administration. The Sasson Report, commissioned by then Prime Minister Ariel Sharon found that the proliferation of outposts was a continuation of the Israeli settlement enterprise and makes it clear that ‚Äúan unauthorized outpost is not a ‚Äúsemi legal‚Äù outpost. Unauthorized is illegal.‚Äù Characteristics of an outpost The population of outposts generally numbers between a few and some 400 people and they are usually composed of modular homes, such as caravans. However, they can also be further developed, having more permanent housing as well as \\"paved roads, bus stops, synagogues and playgrounds.\\" According to the 2005 Sasson Report, there are four principal characteristics of an unauthorized outpost: #There was no government decision to establish it, and in any case no authorized political echelon approved its establishment. #The outpost was established with no legal planning status. Meaning, with no valid detailed plan governing the area it was established upon, which can support a building permit. #An unauthorized outpost is not attached to an existing settlement, but rather at least a few hundred meters distant from it as the crow flies. #The outpost was established in the nineties, mostly from the mid-nineties and on. Sasson defines an outpost as an unauthorized settlement not attached to an existing settlement. If attached, it is regarded as an unauthorized neighborhood. Moreover, outposts can be built either within or beyond the officially determined municipal boundaries. Although the Israeli government acknowledges that settlements built on land privately owned by Palestinians are illegal, it usually provides them with military defense, access to public utilities, and other infrastructure. =Outposts versus neighborhood= Outposts differ from neighborhoods in that they are built at a substantial distance from authorized settlements. Like outposts, neighborhoods such as Ulpana in Beit El still can be built without authorization. Because the difference is obscure, often disputes arise whether new houses are expansion (thickening) of an existing settlement or the start of a new outpost. According to Peace Now, the Israeli government is playing a trick by legalizing outposts as a neighborhood of an existing settlementPeace Now, For the First Time Since 1990 ‚Äì the Government is to Approve the Establishment of New Settlements , section The Trick that failed: Legalization as a neighborhood of an existing settlement. 19 April 2012 Types of outposts=Outposts on state land and on private lands= Israel distinguishes between outposts built on state land and those built on privately owned lands. Since the Elon Moreh case in 1979 before the Israeli Supreme Court, the Government formally follows the policy not to allow new settlements on private Palestinian lands.Peace Now, Settlements in Focus - Behind the Barrier: A Profile of Elon Moreh, Settlement in Focus: Vol. 1, Issue 10, Section Why was Elon Moreh's establishment particularly significant?; 16 September 2005Nir Shalev, Under the Guise of Legality ‚Äì Israel's Declarations of State Land in the West Bank (4,6 MB), pp. 12-15, 56-60. B'Tselem, February 2012. (p.13) Government Decision No. 145 of 1 November 1979: \\"On 11 November 1979, about one month after the ruling in the Elon Moreh case, the government decided \\"to expand the settlement in Judea, Samaria, the Jordan Valley, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights by increasing the population of the existing communities and by establishing new communities on state-owned land.\\" (p.59): \\"International law, [which] forbids the occupying power to change the local law in force in the occupied area on the eve of its occupation, unless such a change is necessary for security needs or for the benefit of the local population.\\" The Netanyahu government seeks to legalize outposts on state land and dismantle those on private lands. As this state land is part of the Occupied Territories, authorization can only make them legal according to Israeli law; it does not change their illegal status under international law. In the West Bank, there are two types of state land: # Land registered as state land under Jordanian rule, seized in 1967 and declared and registered as state land under Military Order No 59 (1967); # State Land declared after 1979 under changed legislation. Most of the state land belongs to the latter type. According to B'Tselem, the declaration as state land was doubtful in many instances.B'Tselem, LAND GRAB ‚Äì Israel's Settlement Policy in the West Bank, pp. 40,51-54, Chapter 3, B Declaration of Land as State Land. May 2002. Summary: Israel pretends to apply Ottoman land laws but uses an interpretation of the law that differs from the Ottoman/British Mandate/Jordanian rule. The latter never used declaration of state land as a method to take over lands.Peace Now, June 2009, Methods of Confiscation International law forbids the occupying power to change the local law in force in the occupied area (in force on the eve of its occupation) unless such a change is necessary for security needs or for the benefit of the local population. = \\"Dummy\\" outposts = \\"Dummy\\" outposts are uninhabited outposts. Apparently, some of them were used to distract the IDF in order to prevent the evacuation of occupied outposts.Akiva Eldar, The defense minister and the case of the disappearing outposts. Haaretz, 11 July 2002 Others are destined to improve negotiation positions by offering extra outposts to remove and show the world that the State is dismantling outposts,Haaretz, Focus / Yesha sacrifices trailers in a larger game. 1 July 2002 The idea of the \\"dummy\\" outposts is attributed to Ze'ev Hever, a former leader of the Jewish Underground. The Sasson Report found that most of the evacuated outposts were unpopulated. = Military outposts = In theory, military outposts are temporary occupations for military strategic purposes, not for the settlement of civilians. In the Occupied Territories, this were typically Nahal settlements, and they became a principal way to start civilian settlements.Christian Science Monitor, Israel plans 16 outposts in West Bank and Golan. 3 February 1982  Number of outposts  Currently, some hundred outposts exist. The Sasson Report gave a provisional figure of 105 unauthorized outposts by March 2005, although Sasson did not have the disposal of all the necessary information. It found that 26 outposts were on state lands, 15 on private Palestinian lands and 7 on survey lands. The definition of outposts, neighborhoods and authorized settlements may differ between concerned parties. Due to different interpretation, the number of outposts (and of settlements as well) may differ in statistics. In 2012, four new outposts were established with 317 new housing units built without building permits: Tzofin Tzafon (Tzofin North) outside the Tzofim settlement near Qalqilyah, Nahlei Tal outside the Talmon settlement near Ramallah, Nahalat Yosef near Nablus and Hill 573 as part of the expansion of the settlement Itamar, according to Peace Now.  Roadmap for Peace  In the framework of the 2003 Roadmap for Peace, Israel committed itself under Prime Minister Sharon to evacuate outposts, erected from March 2001, the start of the Sharon government. The Israeli government gave the U.S. a list of 28 unauthorized outposts erected in the West Bank since that date,The list and a map on:Outposts: the Unripe Settlements. ARIJ, 17 January 2004 of which 12 were ordered to be removed, \\"while some of the remaining 16 outposts [were] in the process of being approved and planned\\", according to the Israeli daily Haaretz.

According to the Israeli NGO Peace Now, the Israeli government under Netanyahu legalised ten illegal outposts in 2012, being the only Israeli government to ever authorize outposts. In February 2012, approval was quietly granted to the outpost Shvut Rachel by redesignating it as a ‚Äúneighborhood‚Äù of the nearby settlement of Shilo, in April of the same year, legal status was conferred on the three outposts Bruchin, Rechelim and Sansana.Tovah Lazaroff, IDF signs injunction legalizing Bruchin outpost.

The Levy Report published in July 2012, which comes to the conclusion that Israel's presence in the West Bank is not occupation, recommends state approval for unauthorized outposts, and provides proposals for new guidelines for settlement construction. As of April 2013, the report was not brought before the Israeli cabinet or any parliamentary or governmental body which would have the power to approve it.

Early life He was born at 25 Gladstone Street Northallerton, North Riding of Yorkshire in 1922 into a \\"Railway Family\\" (his father, Tom Weighell was a signalman, his grandfather Bill was a guard and his brother Maurice was a driver). He was educated at a Church of England school, which he left at 15 and became an apprentice mechanic. Railway work In 1938 he took an apprenticeship at the road motor engineering department of the London and North Eastern Railway company. He became active in the NUR immediately upon starting work for the railways, believing in 'one union for all railway staff'. This brought him into conflict with the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF); Weighell was a so-called 'footplate grade', traditionally represented by ASLEF, not the NUR. Weighell considered craft unions (unions catering to a particular job within an industry rather than to the industry itself) as outmoded and elitist, and apparently said so on many occasions at the Northallerton Railwaymen's club. In January 1940 he joined the locomotive department as a fireman, becoming a qualified engine driver in 1943. He left the railways in 1945 to become a professional footballer, but returned in 1947. In 1954 he was made a full-time divisional officer for the NUR, and moved to their headquarters in London. In 1965 he was elected Assistant General Secretary of the NUR, and his maiden speech at the Labour Party conference in 1966 was heavily critical of Frank Cousins' policies on income and pay restraint, further cementing his reputation as a \\"disruptive influence\\". In 1969 he was named as Senior AGS, becoming Sidney Greene's deputy when the need arose, and when Greene chose to retire in 1975 Weighell won the leadership election, with more votes than all three of his opponents put together, a rare occurrence in the NUR. Following rumours of a massive cut in rail services he threatened to stop NUR-sponsored MPs from backing any kind of bill. In 1973 he became secretary of the newly formed Transport 2000. He spoke at the 1976 Labour Party Conference, along with Johnny Johnson and Ray Buckton, talking about the deep disappointment following the party's desertion of its election manifesto. During the 1960s he waged a campaign against the conversion of the railway engines to diesel fuel, arguing that the best conversion in the long-term would be to electrical power. He failed to convince either the National Executive or Harold Wilson, but made more progress in the 1970s with his new leverage as General Secretary, attacking Anthony Crosland's White Paper on transport integration. A stroke of luck saw Crosland moved to the foreign office in 1976 and replaced by William Rodgers, who was more receptive to comments from the NUR. The result was the Transport Act 1978, which Weighell saw as a victory. Politics In 1945 he joined the Labour Party, becoming a member of the local trades council. He was initially regarded as a disruptive influence and sacked from the trades council for introducing politics into the proceedings. In 1973, he was elected to the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party. Downfall At the Labour Party conference in 1982, the NUR delegation decided to vote for the National Union of Mineworkers, led by Arthur Scargill. Weighell, however, secretly voted for the EETPU, a fact quickly discovered by conference officials. Branded a cheat, Weighell was forced to offer his resignation, which a union conference convened in Birmingham accepted 41-36\\\\. Despite the scandal he maintained he had done the right thing, saying \\"I'm glad to have been a casualty if it means that the party executive does not fall into the hands of militants.\\" Later life After resigning in 1983 he moved back to Yorkshire and joined the British Airports' Authority board, as well as acting as a consultant to Tyne Tees Television. In 1983 he wrote an autobiography titled On the Rails which was extremely scathing to both the successive and earlier General Secretaries. Personal life On 1 September 1949 Weighell married Margaret Hunter, with whom he had one son and one daughter, Jennifer and Anthony. In 1956 Margaret and Jennifer were both killed when the family were involved in a car crash. Sidney himself spent several months in hospital, but returned to work after he had recovered. He married a second time on 21 November 1959 to Joan Willetts, a market research interviewer, but no children resulted. Football Weighell was a skilled footballer, and always attributed his failure of the 11-plus exams to his preference to play football rather than study. He was offered trials for Sunderland, Newcastle United and Sheffield United, and signed for Sunderland on 12 October 1945 for a fee of ¬£10 and played for 2 seasons as an inside-left on the second team, claiming that he was the best inside-left in the north east \\"except for a certain gentleman by the name of Raich Carter\\".

Its last duty station was at Yokota Air Base, Japan, where it was inactivated on 1 April 1992. A non-flying wing, the wing's mission at Yokota was to perform host unit missions. The wing had no numbered flying squadrons, although it did operate a few T-39 Sabreliner aircraft and UH-1 Huey helicopters. It was absorbed by the 374th Airlift Wing under the \\"one base-one wing\\" organizational concept. History : See: 475th Fighter Group for complete history and lineage information The 475th Fighter Wing was activated in 1948 as part of the \\"Base-Wing\\" USAF reorganization, assigned to the 315th Air Division of Far East Air Forces where it performed postwar occupation duty. The wing was one of several occupation units in Japan, and was inactivated on 1 April 1949 at Ashiya Airfield due to budget reductions. =Cold War= In January 1968, the 475th Tactical Fighter Wing was activated at Misawa Air Base, Japan, replacing the 39th Air Division as the host unit, with the 439th Combat Support Group being replaced by the 475th Combat Support Group that controlled the base support units. At Misawa, the wing trained for offensive and reconnaissance operations. Initial assigned operational squadrons of the wing were: * 67th Tactical Fighter Squadron (15 January 1968 ‚Äì 15 March 1971) (F-4D) (UP) * 356th Tactical Fighter Squadron (15 January 1968 ‚Äì 15 March 1971) (F-4D) (UK) * 391st Tactical Fighter Squadron (22 July 1968 ‚Äì 28 February 1971) (F-4D) (UD) * 421st Tactical Fighter Squadron (Attached) (23 April 1969 ‚Äì 25 Jun 1969) (F-4E) (LC) * 45th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron* (15 January 1968 ‚Äì 15 March 1971) (RF-101C) * 612th Tactical Fighter Squadron* (15 January 1968 ‚Äì 15 March 1971) (F-100D) The 45th TRS and 612th TFS were unmanned during their entire assignment, as squadron was on deployed status to bases in South Vietnam (The 45th TRS deployed to Tan Son Nhut Air Base; the 612th TFS at Ph√π C√°t Air Base). From Misawa, aircraft and personnel of the 67th, 356th and 391st TFS rotated six aircraft every ten days to Kusan and Taegu Air Bases in South Korea performing Nuclear alert duty. On 16 May 1968, the M8.3 Tokachi earthquake caused over $1 million worth of damage to Misawa AB. Air Force fighter operations ceased at Misawa in early 1971, and the wing phased down operations. All flying resources were reassigned to Kusan AB South Korea for the 3d Tactical Fighter Wing, and the wing was inactivated on 15 March, being replaced by the 6112th Air Base Group as Misawa was phased down for reconstruction. After a brief period of inactivation, the 475th Air Base Wing was reactivated on 1 November 1971 at Yokota Air Base, Japan, replacing the 6100th Air Base Wing. At Yokota, the wing inherited a huge support complex, with some 47 sub-locations in all parts of Japan, including operation of Yokota and Tachikawa Air Bases, Fuchu and Chitose Air Stations, and numerous housing complexes within the Tokyo area. In 1972 the wing's components were as below: * HQ 475th Air Base Wing (Yokota AB) ** 556th Reconnaissance Squadron ** 475th Consolidated Aircraft Maintenance Squadron ** 475th Supply Squadron ** 475th Security Police Squadron ** 475th Transportation Squadron ** 475th Civil Engineering Squadron ** 475th Services Squadron ** 34th Air Base Squadron (Grant Heights, Nerima, Tokyo) ** 37th Air Base Squadron (Fuchu AS, Fuchu, Tokyo) ** 331st Air Base Squadron (Johnson FHA) ** 475th Air Base Squadron (Tachikawa AB) *** USAF Hospital, Tachikawa ** 6120th Broadcasting Squadron (South Camp Drake, Asaka, Saitama) ** 6123d Air Base Squadron (Chitose AS) *** USAF Hospital, Chitose ** OL-AA, 475th Air Base Wing (Shingu Wells, Hakata, Fukuoka) *** USAF Hospital, Shingu Wells ** OL-AB, 475th Air Base Wing (Misawa AB) *** USAF Hospital, Misawa At Yokota, the only operational flying squadron was the 556th Reconnaissance Squadron (formerly assigned to the 347th Tactical Fighter Wing at Yokota from 1968). The 556th RS was a highly specialized unit, employing modified C-130B-II, EB-57E electronic counter measures (ECM) aircraft and on occasion TDY C-130A-II and EC-97G Stratotankers. Only the EB-57E's carried the tail code GT, the C-130B-IIs and other aircraft being uncoded. =Post Vietnam era= The 55th RS was inactivated on 30 June 1972, after which the 475th supported a Royal Thai Air Force C-123 Provider detachment which provided airlift support to the United Nations Command (Rear) of Fifth Air Force, which relocated its headquarters to Yokota in November 1974. The 475th ABW also gradually closed down many of its widely dispersed installations, sites and facilities, consolidating them as well as assisting in the closing of Tachikawa Air Base in September 1977. On 1 October 1978, Military Airlift Command (MAC) established the 316th Tactical Airlift Group at Yokota, being supported by the 475th ABW. This was MAC's operational support airlift group in the Far East, with the 1403d Military Airlift Squadron flying a combination of CT-39As, C-12Fs, and C-21As which it obtained from various bases in PACAF, consolidating them at Yokota. On 1 October 1989, this unit was upgraded to a wing level and personnel redesignated as the 374th Tactical Airlift Wing, which was moved from Clark AB, Philippines in a name-only redesignation. The 475th ABW was inactivated on 1 April 1992 as part of a consolidation effort, being replaced as host unit at Yokota by the 374th, which was redesignated 374th Airlift Wing same date. =Lineage= * Established as 475th Fighter Wing on 10 August 1948 : Activated on 18 August 1948 : Inactivated 1 April 1949 * Redesignated 475th Tactical Fighter Wing and activated on 21 December 1967 (not organized) : Organized on 15 January 1968 : Inactivated 15 March 1971 * Redesignated 475th Air Base Wing on 20 October 1971 : Activated 1 November 1971 : Inactivated 1 April 1992, personnel and equipment consolidated into 374th Airlift Wing =Assignments= * 315th Air Division, 18 Aug 1948 ‚Äì 1 Apr 1949 * Pacific Air Forces, 21 December 1967 (not organized) * Fifth Air Force, 15 Jan 1968 ‚Äì 15 Mar 1971 * Fifth Air Force, 1 Nov 1971 ‚Äì 1 Apr 1992 =Components= Group * 475th Fighter Group: 18 Aug 1948 ‚Äì 1 Apr 1949 Squadrons * 16th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron: 16 Mar 1970 ‚Äì 15 Feb 1971, attached 16‚Äì22 Feb 1971. * 45th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron: 15 Jan 1968 ‚Äì 15 Mar 1971 (not operational). * 67th Tactical Fighter Squadron: 15 Jan 1968 ‚Äì 15 Mar 1971 * 356th Tactical Fighter Squadron: 15 Jan 1968 ‚Äì 15 Mar 1971 * 391st Tactical Fighter Squadron: 22 Jul 1968 ‚Äì 28 Feb 1971 * 421st Tactical Fighter Squadron: attached 23 Apr-25 Jun 1969 * 556th Reconnaissance Squadron: 1 Nov 1971 ‚Äì 30 Jun 1972 * 612th Tactical Fighter Squadron: 15 Jan 1968 ‚Äì 15 Mar 1971 (not operational). =Stations= * Itazuke Airfield, Japan, 28 August 1948 * Ashiya Airfield, Japan, 25 March ‚Äì 1 April 1949 * Misawa AB, Japan 15 January 1968 ‚Äì 15 March 1971 * Yokota AB, Japan, 1 November 1971 ‚Äì 1 April 1992 =Aircraft= * F-51 Mustang, 1948‚Äì1949 * F-100 Super Sabre, 1968 * F-4D Phantom II, 1968‚Äì1971 * RF-4C Phantom II, 1970‚Äì1971 * C-130 Hercules, 1971‚Äì1972 * C-123 Provider, 1971‚Äì1976 References ; Notes ; Citations =Bibliography= Martin, Patrick.

Her body was recovered two days later near Perry, Florida. Sting operation and death Hoffman was under drug court supervision for possession of 25 g (0.9 oz.) of cannabis discovered during a traffic stop on February 22, 2007. On April 17, 2008, Tallahassee, Florida, police searched her apartment and uncovered another 151.7 g (5.328 oz.) of cannabis, and four ecstasy pills. Hoffman faced a possible prison sentence if charged and convicted on criminal charges related to the discovered drugs. Police attempted to persuade her to identify other marijuana dealers to avoid the charges. She refused. The police then pressured her to act as a confidential informant in a drug sting operation instead in exchange for not being charged with additional drug charges. The purported goal of the operation was to buy 1,500 ecstasy pills, 2 oz. of cocaine, and two handguns, which was contrary to department policy, using $13,000 cash in a buy‚Äìbust operation. Hoffman's family stated that all three buys were very out-of-character for her. Two narcotics officers arranged for the drug buy at a specific location and were providing security for the buy. That was later deemed to be insufficient manpower to protect the informant and still apprehend the suspects. While she was at the drug buy, with the policemen monitoring, the two suspects changed the location of the buy. She was informed not to follow the suspects to the new location, but technical issues prevented her from actually receiving the instructions. Her police handlers lost track of her when she agreed with the suspects to change the plans and left the buy spot with the two suspects in their stolen silver BMW. While in transit, the two suspects allegedly executed her with the gun she was supposed to buy. Murder investigation and sentencing According to police documents, a witness described seeing the BMW stuck in a ditch, with a 2005 Volvo belonging to Hoffman idling nearby, between 7 pm and 7:30 pm, about 30 minutes after the police lost track of Hoffman. The witness claimed that the BMW drove off when he stopped to help the driver try to get the car out of the ditch, but the vehicle later returned as the witness was leaving. The witness claimed he became suspicious and decided to leave when the driver of the Volvo opened the trunk and revealed a camouflage blanket and neat stacks of female clothing. Deneilo R. Bradshaw, 23, and Andrea Jabbar Green, 25, who were fired from their jobs at a window tint and car detailing shop just days before the incident, were charged with armed robbery in connection with the events leading up to Hoffman's death. The Tallahassee Police Department admitted that Hoffman had no training to work undercover, she did not know the two men targeted in the sting, and she had no experience with cocaine or firearms and very little with MDMA. The officers involved in the operation were suspended with pay, and the family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the city. The two buyers were charged by a grand jury with first degree murder. Details of the murder itself were not released at the time. Hoffman's story garnered many news headlines including a page on the Tallahassee Democrat website dedicated to information surrounding her death. 20/20 covered the story on July 25, 2008, and Dateline NBC covered it on January 16, 2009. On December 17, 2009, which would have been Hoffman's 25th birthday, Bradshaw, one of the murder suspects, was found guilty of first-degree murder with robbery and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole plus 30 years (concurrent). Greene was also convicted of Hoffman's murder and sentenced to life in prison.  Rachel's Law  On May 7, 2009, a law (dubbed \\"Rachel's Law\\") was passed by the Florida State Senate, which brought into effect on July 1, 2009, a number of requirements for law enforcement agencies in Florida regarding the use of police informants. While Rachel's Law became statewide policy for all police departments, at least one major city department began taking steps towards training on the new policies at least three months sooner than required. \\"Rachel's Law\\" requires law enforcement agencies to provide special training for officers who recruit confidential informants, instruct informants that reduced sentences may not be provided in exchange for their work, and permit informants to request a lawyer if they want one.

Two blasts took place inside the premises of two hospitals, about 40 minutes after the initial series of blasts. One of the blasts in the hospitals occurred when injured victims of the initial series of blasts were being admitted there. Another bomb was found and defused on the following day in the Hatkeshwar area. Two live bombs were also retrieved from Maninagar, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi's constituency.

Do whatever you can, within 5 minutes from now, feel the terror of Death!‚Äù The e-mail also contained threats against Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Vilasrao Deshmukh, and his deputy, R.R. Patil, with the claim, \\"We wonder at your memory. Have you forgotten the evening of 11 July 2006 so quickly and so easily?‚Äù Furthermore, the threats went on to warn Indian businessman Mukesh Ambani of Reliance Industries to \\"think-twice\\" before \\"usurping and building a citadel on a land in Mumbai that belongs to the Waqf board...lest it turns into horrifying memories for you which you will never ever forget\\".

In 358 minor league appearances, he went 44‚Äì35 with a 3.73 ERA and 42 saves, including 184 walks, 494 strikeouts, and 639‚Öî innings of work. =Coaching career= After retiring from baseball, Stanifer did not stay far away from the game. He initially became a baseball coach at the Largo High School in the town where he currently resides. Achieving moderate success and developing a reputation as a valuable coach in the Tampa Bay Area, this time served as a very good stepping stone into the coaching world for Stanifer. He coached there until the year 2009, until he ultimately made the move to his current position at Northeast High School. With his new position at NEHS, Stanifer brought a new approach to a team that featured many college bound players with high expectations. He used his professional experience to mentor the players and lead them in the right direction. With Northeast St. Petersburg, having a strong little league baseball presence, the school's proximity to the area would allow for a steady stream of talent to flow through the school. It was up to Stanifer to hone the talent and bring out the best in the players. The baseball program was already relevant, even having former MLB First Round Draft pick, Doug Waechter, being an alumnus, but Stanifer brought consistent success to the school. Stanifer led the team to multiple district championships, including a run of 4 in a row. In 2017, Stanifer's team made one the schools deepest runs in history, making it all the way to the Regional Semifinals of the 7A FHSAA State Playoffs. In 2018, Stanifer was ejected from a semifinal game for repeatedly complaining about the umpiring. \\"After the ejection, Stanifer continued to yell at the umpires as he was being escorted from the field. Stanifer allegedly called the umpire 'Tubby.' He also said 'Boy, the things I would do if I got you in the parking lot. Ohhh, you would regret it.'\\" The Florida High School Athletic Association found that Stanifer committed Level 3 egregious unsportsmanlike conduct and suspended him for one year. He is not eligible to coach again until May 2, 2019 Personal life Stanifer also was a member of the Florida Marlins 1997 World Series Champions. He currently resides in Largo, Florida, where he lives with his wife and their two young daughters. He also works at his own company on top of his job as the head coach of the Northeast High School Varsity Baseball team. He is also now a member of the Anderson University Hall of Fame.

Carillon of a morris dancer over a jeweler in Munich Moresca (Italian), morisca (Spanish), mourisca (Portuguese) or moresque, mauresque (French), also known in French as the danse des bouffons, is a 15th/16th century pantomime dance in which the executants wore Moorish costumes. One such is the concluding music of Monteverdi's L'Orfeo. One of the best examples of the moresca can be seen in Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 production of Romeo and Juliet, which has a scene with moresca characters and lavish, florid portrayal of the dance in the Capulet home. In the 15th century, the moresca is the most-often mentioned dance type in literature. On the rare occasions other dances (such as the basse danse, saltarello, or piva) are mentioned, the moresca is almost invariably described as well. In its early manifestation it appears in two forms: as a solo dance, and as a couple or group dance in which the dancers mime a sword combat between Christians and Muslims . The moresca continues to be danced in Spain, Corsica, and Guatemala, and the name as well as certain characteristics of the choreography are related to the English Morris dance (; ). The term moresca (Italian: moorish song) is also used for an unrelated carnivalesque form of villanella, a popular song form found in Italy c.1550‚Äì1600 (see moresche, which is the Italian plural of moresca). It receives its name from the texts, which parody the speech of Moors, defined as Muslims generally or more narrowly as inhabitants of the Barbary Coast .

The museum is located on the site of the former Freilassing locomotive shed which belongs to the Deutsche Bahn AG and houses part of the Deutsches Museum's railway collection. The second part of the collection is in the transport centre of the Deutsches Museum on the Theresienh√∂he in Munich. Modell des Ringlokschuppens Freilassing  The Site  The locomotive shed was built between 1902 and 1905 on the railway line from Munich to Salzburg. Its facilities include a roundhouse and turntable, its own power station, workshops and equipment for the stabling and maintenance of railway vehicles and locomotives. The Deutsche Bahn AG used the site until 1994. With the closure and sale of the training workshops in 1998, the Freilassing locomotive shed era was finally over. The buildings were placed under historic building status the same year. In 2003 the town of Freilassing acquired the site with the cooperation of the Deutsches Museum's Transport Centre. The restoration and construction work for the 'Freilassing Locomotive World' museum began in autumn 2004. Almost simultaneously the society 'Friends of the Historic 1905 Freilassing Locomotive Shed' (Freunde des Historischen Lokschuppens 1905 Freilassing e.V.) was founded, and they supported the museum energetically. On 2 September 2006 the Freilassing Locomotive World was officially opened to visitors. The roof of the building was so badly damaged by hurricane Kyrill on 18/19 January 2007 that the Locomotive World had to be temporarily closed. Meanwhile, the roof trusses were supported to ensure its stability. Even the rest of the damage was repaired sufficiently that the Locomotive World could once again be freely visited.  Museum Project  On seventeen of the twenty roads of the roundhouse, numerous exhibits on the theme of 150 years of railway history are displayed. Amongst them is a large railway fleet from the Deutsches Museum, that could not be accommodated in the museum's Transport Centre site opened in 2006 due to lack of space. The move of the exhibits was reported by Bahn TV under the title A Museum Moves House. Even a few exhibits from the Nuremberg Transport Museum may be seen. The remaining three roads serve as workshops for the restoration, maintenance and care of historic locomotives and rolling stock. A model railway layout replicates Freilassing locomotive shed at the time it was used by the Deutsche Bahn AG. For children aged 6 to 12 the Lokomotive World offers a fun park (the so-called Kinderwelt) exploring the subjects of railways and technology. On certain days there are additional presentations or campaign days. The vehicle collection is being continually added to.

Mannerist grotesque ornament drawing by the Dutch painter and architect Hans Vredeman de Vries (1527‚Äì1609), of around 1604. The figures of the fauns at bottom, and almost the dragons at top, are moresques in the figure sense. Moresque is an obsolete alternative term to \\"Moorish\\" in English, and in the arts has some specific meanings. By itself, the word is used to describe the stylized plant-based forms of tendrils and leaves found in ornament and decoration in the applied arts in Renaissance Europe that are derived from the arabesque patterns of Islamic ornament. Like their Islamic ancestors, they differ from the typical European plant scroll in being many-branched and spreading rather than forming a line in one direction. The use of half-leaves with their longest side running along the stem is typical for both. First found in 15th-century Italy, especially Venice, moresques continue in the Mannerist and Northern Mannerist styles of the 16th century. Figures Another, related, meaning was defined in 1611 by Randle Cotgrave's A Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues as: \\"a rude or anticke painting, or carving, wherin the feet and tayles of beasts, &c;, are intermingled with, or made to resemble, a kind of wild leaves, &c.;\\" OED, \\"Moresque\\" The word was also used for such a figure, starting off as a human or animal, but terminating as part of a decorative scheme of foliage or geometric strapwork. In fact the origin of figures like those described by Cotgrave comes not from the Islamic world, but from the Renaissance version, influenced by the Ancient Roman grotesque decorative style, of medieval ornament, especially that found in illuminated manuscripts. Here men and beasts whose forms disappear into geometric or foliage decoration go back almost a thousand years to the interlace of Insular art seen in the Book of Kells and other manuscripts. These themselves derive from the Animal style of barbarian Europe. However, the term moresque is not used of these medieval versions. Book covers Tooled and decorated fine bookbindings and printer's ornaments marking the end of a chapter were one of the first places where the style appeared, in 15th century Italy. Moresque decoration remained a common element in decorated book bindings throughout the 16th century, and across Europe, often combined with strapwork or bandwork. Other meanings *\\"Moresque dance\\" is a fancy term for the English Morris dance (OED, quoting Chambers' Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, 1727).

He is well known for animating Disneys' shorts: Mickey's Trailer and Fantasia. Love won the Golden Award at the 1984 Motion Pictures Screen Cartoonists Awards in 1984Ed Love - Awards. Internet Movie Database.  Career  Love was born on May 24, 1910 in Tremont, Pennsylvania. Love came to Los Angeles in 1930. The effects from The Great Depression caused Love to search for a job in 1931. He discovered an opening as a Disney cartoonist in the local newspaper. Love was interested, used a phone book to find an animator, and learned how to animate in the span of four months. Besides drawings as a child, his entire animation experience consisted of only those four months of learning. Love walked into Walt Disney's office, unscheduled, and showed him a stop motion animation sample of Mickey Mouse playing the violin. Walt Disney was satisfied and hired him to work at Disney as an animator that same day.* Love was initially paid $18 a week and animated Goofy and Pluto more frequently than other characters. Disney gave their animators a lot of freedom by giving them the option if they want to add additional frames. Love worked with the effects manage but not with other animators. He participated in a strike with other animators and left Disney on November 14, 1941. At that time, Love was making $50 a week. Shortly after Love left Disney, he was offered a job at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1941 and worked there with Tex Avery until 1946. At MGM, Love would animate as much as 5,600 out of the total 8,800 frames for a short film, which is about 4 out of 6 minutes of animation. Love was happy with MGM and did not feel guilty for leaving Disney. At MGM, Love and other animators were limited to only 480 frames a week. This limitation allowed MGM to provide openings for new animators. It also restricted the present animators from being paid more regardless whether or not they produce more frames. This created a fun, casual, and relaxing work environment for Love.* In 1947, Love worked at Walter Lantz Productions where he focused on animating Woody Woodpecker. In 1948, the state of Walter Lantz Productions was rapidly decreasing because Lantz did not have funds for the animations, causing Love to leave. Love worked on television shows at Hanna-Barbera Productions in 1959. Death Love died on May 8, 1996 in Valencia, California.

Following reconstruction work, the park officially reopened on 13 April 2009. In the future, 29 historic locomotives from the EU member countries and also Switzerland will be exhibited in the roundhouse and on the turntable, the so- called Europa Roundhouse (Rundhaus Europa), which are protected historical buildings. In addition to the roundhouse there are also three historical steam locomotive halls with a workshop atmosphere and a historical smithy.  Museum project and events  The Augsburg Railway Park offers the national railways of all EU states the opportunity to exhibit a historic locomotive (a so-called 'ambassador' locomotive) in the \\"Europa Roundhouse\\". The culture of the country of origin of an exhibition is always the focus. The historical locomotives will be accessible to visitors to the site or will be displayed on the turntable. From time to time there will also be national weeks (e. g. Austria week), sometimes with additional special exhibitions related to the region being celebrated. As part of some events there will be jazz concerts in the large steam engine hall and presentations in the smithy. In addition there are restaurants permanently on site. Regular jazz concerts (Jazz in the Railway Park) take place on the first Sunday in the month from May to September. In addition to the ambassador locomotives there are many other museum locomotives in the collection, which it has not always been easy to view before. The whole collection is being continually expanded. During Advent, special steam engine services are organised, that offer journeys through the winter landscape.  The site  In 1906 the Royal Bavarian State Railways built two roundhouses with turntables south of the Augsburg Hauptbahnhof (Augsburg Central Station). On the area surrounding the Railway Park are further buildings (workshops, washdown areas, wheelset repair workshops and accommodation for the locomotive crews) belonging to the former repair shop together with trackage and a signal box. In the Second World War the area was largely spared from bomb damage, even on the devastating night of bombing from 25 to 26 February 1944 on Augsburg, during which the main station and station yard were badly damaged or destroyed. After the war the Deutsche Bahn AG used the site until about 1990. Since 1996 the roundhouse has been placed under historical building protection. The owner of the site is the Aurelis Real Estate GmbH & Co.KG.  Workshops  In the workshops of the Augsburg Railway Park, railway vehicles are refurbished and restored to museum standards. A historical post van was restored in these workshops for the Deutsches Museum's Transport Centre, a branch of the Deutsches Museum on the Teresienh√∂he/Schwarntalerh√∂he. The maintenance and preservation of the operational and protected DRG Class 41 steam locomotive, no. 41 018, belonging to the Munich Steam Locomotive Company (Dampflok-Gesellschaft M√ºnchen) was also carried out by these workshops.

This type of railway vehicle was formerly used by the railway maintenance divisions to inspect and maintain tracks and signal installations. The collection has a total of five vehicles: a touring trolley (Bereisungsdraisine) KLV 11, two maintenance trolleys, KLV 12 and 82, a Hungarian trolley, MAV Pft-P401, a rail bicycle and a rail moped. At the events there are often opportunities to ride in the KLV 11, something especially popular with children. The KLV 12, KLV 82 and MAV Pft-P401 trolleys are not currently operational and are being refurbished.  Raupach steam engine  Raupach steam engine in its intermediate location The static steam engine was built in 1911 by the engineering works of \\"Richard Raupach\\", based on the system by R. Lenke, in G√∂rlitz. It could generate 75 PS. Once upon a time, more than 1000 examples of this engine were built, that were used in many factories to provide electrical energy. Originally this particular engine was delivered to the Schaaf Brewery in Niedermending near Koblenz, where it was in service in 1932. But in the same year the engine was sold to the distillery in Munich-Gro√ühadern. There it was used to drive various aggregates. Not until the closure of the distillery in 2001 was the steam engine finally taken out of service, having operated for 90 years. Members of the Munich Steam Locomotive Company made contact with the distillery company and succeeded in acquiring the steam engine. On 26 July 2003, it was dismantled and moved by low-loader to the Railway Park. There it was temporarily housed in the northern roundhouse and restored. After the events exhibiting the steam engine in its intermediate location, it was moved at the end of October 2003. After further work, it was operational again on 16 July 2007. This time however it was not driven by steam, but for display purposed worked by an electric motor and illuminated.  150th anniversary of Rudolf Diesel  Diesel railbus VT 12.5 \\"Stuttgarter R√∂ssle\\" On the occasion of the 150th birthday of Rudolf Diesel in 2008 the Augsburg Railway Park hosted a large locomotive exhibition on Easter Monday on the theme of diesel locomotives. Not only were there diesel engines to be seen, but also historic lorries, buses, fire engines and tractors. The event's strap line was \\"Vehicles driven by diesel engines on rail or road\\". For younger visitors there was a children's programme with Easter egg hunts and tractor racing. One visitor was the diesel railbus VT 12.5 \\"Little Stuttgart Horse\\" (Stuttgarter R√∂√üle) owned by the DB ZugBus Regionalverkehr Alb-Bodensee, with 220 passengers. The Railway Park had a record number of over 5000 visitors that day.  Miscellaneous  At present there is a TEE (Trans-Europ-Express) train rake VT 601 with 9 centre coaches, the so-called Blue Star Train, next to the Railway Park on former DB land. From the middle to end of November 2006 the Istanbul Orient Express train was stationed at the Augsburg Railway Park and could be visited during a two-day event. The chance to visit this historic train resonated with the public. The event was accompanied by a jazz concert and food as well as a special exhibition on the history of the Orient-Express. On 6 December 2006 the museum train began a special trip from Augsburg Main station to Salzburg. The train was hauled by an electric locomotive, not 41 018 as announced. The Railway Park is a favourite destination of historic trains, such as the 01 1066 belonging to the Ulmer Eisenbahnfreunde (Ulm Railway Friends), which can be serviced and turned for the return journey.

It is based on the concept that all legitimate authority for government comes from the Crown. Originating in the United Kingdom, it is now used throughout the Commonwealth realms. In realms where the monarch is represented by a governor-general, governor or administrator, the phrase may be modified to be at the Governor's pleasure, since the governor-general, governor, lieutenant governor or administrator is the Queen's personal representative in the country, state or province. Service to the Crown People appointed by the sovereign to serve the Crown and who have no set limit to the time they occupy their given office‚Äîfor example, governors general and ministers of the Crown‚Äîare said to serve at Her Majesty's pleasure. In Canada, provincial lieutenant governors are appointed by the Canadian monarch's federal representative, the governor general, and are thus described in the Constitution Act, 1867, as holding office \\"during the pleasure of the Governor General\\". Similarly, Australian ministers of the Crown are, by the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900, appointed to serve \\"during the pleasure of the Governor-General\\". Incarceration The term is used to describe detention in prison for an indefinite length of time; a judge may rule that a person be \\"detained at Her Majesty's pleasure\\" for serious offences or based on a successful insanity defence. This is sometimes used where there is a great risk of re-offending; however, it is most often used for juvenile offenders, usually as a substitute for life sentencing (which might be much longer for younger offenders). For example, section 90 of the United Kingdom's Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 (which only extends to England and Wales) states: \\"Where a person convicted of murder or any other offence the sentence for which is fixed by law as life imprisonment appears to the court to have been aged under 18 at the time the offence was committed, the court shall (notwithstanding anything in this or any other Act) sentence him to be detained during Her Majesty's pleasure.\\" Prisoners held at Her Majesty's pleasure are frequently reviewed to determine whether their sentence can be deemed complete; although this power traditionally rested with the monarch, such reviews are now made by others‚Äîthe Secretary of State for Justice in England and Wales, for instance. Minimum terms are also set, before which the prisoner cannot be released; in England and Wales, these were originally set by the Home Secretary, but since 30 November 2000 have been set by the trial judge. Prisoners' sentences are typically deemed to be complete when the reviewing body is \\"satisfied that there has been a significant change in the offender's attitude and behaviour\\". Derivatives In Commonwealth republics, such as Botswana, India and Singapore, the term used is \\"during the President's pleasure\\". In Hong Kong, following the transfer of its sovereignty to China in 1997, the term was modified to \\"at executive discretion\\". Subsequently this was held to be incompatible with the separation of powers enshrined in the Basic Law by Judge Michael Hartmann in the case Yau Kwong Man v. Secretary for Security.Yau Kwong Man v. Secretary for Security [2002] HKCFI 896; HCAL1595/2001 (9 September 2002) In Malaysia, the term used is \\"At the Agong's pleasure\\".https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2009/07/23/youth-to- be-detained-at--pleasure-of-the-agong-update In the United States, the equivalent standard for political appointments is called \\"at the pleasure of the President\\". There is no analogous prison sentence.

The school first opened in 1975 and was officially opened in 2000 by the honourable Dean Wells. The school is situated next door to Craigslea State Primary School and some facilities, such as the swimming pool, are shared between the two schools. It is also reputedly the first completely low-set public secondary school in Queensland and several of the buildings' entrance points have since been modified to provide convenient access to students in motorised wheelchairs. Most of the school's buildings were built in the mid-1970s, whereas the mid-2000s saw the opening of the school's auditorium and another building for the senior subject of commercial hospitality, which was established at the school in 2007. The grounds outside the science building and the library courtyard feature artworks created by the school's students, and from end 2010 to the start of 2011 school year the school was upgrading both Science and Year 8 Blocks, however due to many faults in the science block and having to close down again after it opened, it was not officially open until last term of 2011. In late 2012, the school undertook the construction of a new building to accommodate the growing needs of the school. From 2015, Year 7 became the first year of high school in Queensland. Enrolments for each year level in February 2019 totalled between 108 (Year 12) and 200 (Year 7) students, giving in the school a total population of 1003 students. According to the Census (August) enrolment collection, the school's student population ranged between 970 and 994 from 2015 to 2018.

Similar species  Close-up of face The greater short-nosed fruit bat is similar to the lesser short-nosed fruit bat but has generally longer forearms, longer ears and a much longer skull. P. lucasi has only one pair of lower incisors, a lack of white edges to the ears and a usually greyer color. C. horsfieldi is larger, with heavily cusped molars. M. ecaudatus usually has a more upturned nose, lacks a bright collar and tail, and has only one pair of lower incisors.  Diet  Lesser short-nosed fruit bats are frugivorous. They prefer aromatic fruit, especially mangoes. The bats feed mainly on small fruits by sucking out the juices and soft pulp. They also eat nectar and pollen.  Reproduction  The mating system of lesser short-nosed fruit bats is polygynous. In the Philippines, most populations give birth twice a year and pregnant females have been found in almost all months. The period of gestation is approximately 3.5 to 4 months. The mother nurses the young with milk for about six to eight weeks. It takes about a year for the male to become sexually mature, and most females become pregnant at approximately six to eight months of age. Medway observed that breeding was non-seasonal in Peninsular Malaysia and that a single young was produced and carried by the female during the early stage of its life. Breeding is also non-seasonal in Thailand.Lekagul B. and J. A. McNeely. 1977. Mammals of Thailand. Sahankarnbhat, Bangkok. Most pregnancies occur from March to June with peaks in January and September.Nowak, R.(1999). Walker‚Äôs Mammals of the World (6th Ed.).Vol. 1. Baltimore and London: The Johns University Press. pp.286‚Äì287. Lactation corresponds with the peak of the rainy season as well as the fruiting season. Both sexes take care of the young. Males play an active role in lactation and feeding the young. They have mammary glands that are the same size as those of the female and exceed 8% of their overall body mass.  Behavior  Lesser short-nosed fruit bats prefer to roost in small groups in trees, under leaves, and in caves. Young males may roost alone. It is common for one male to roost with up to four females. Females may gather in groups of up to 20.Richarz, K. and A. Limbrunner. (1993). The World of Bats. Neptune City, NJ: TFH Publications, Inc. To feed, the bats bite off the center part of palm fruit clusters, leaving a hollow for hanging, which is also the method they use to construct a shelter. Males may spend more than two months chewing the veins of leaves and palm fronds until they fall to form a shelter. Individuals use tactile, visual, and acoustic stimuli to communicate. They forage with their acute sense of smell and navigate with their keen vision.  Distribution and habitat  mark-recapture\\" estimate of the local population size.

Ecological and economic importance  Lesser short-nosed fruit bats are free of terrestrial predation because of their ability to fly. Some human cultures consume them as a delicacy. They play important roles in plant pollination. Plants such as bananas, avocados, dates, mangoes and peaches, and depend on them for seed dispersal. The bats are considered to be crop pests since they consume and damage fruit.Schultes, D. 2003. The Malaysian Fruit Bat. (On-line). Animals at the Fort Worth Zoo. Accessed January 09, 2009.  Conservation status  Lesser short-nosed fruit bats are designated a least-concern species by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) because the population is widely distributed, stable and still abundant.

A gang tunnelled from a rented shop two doors away to come up through the floor of the vault. The value of the property stolen is unknown, but is likely to have been between ¬£1.25 and ¬£3 million; only ¬£231,000 was recovered by the police. The burglary was planned by Anthony Gavin, a career criminal, who was inspired by \\"The Red-Headed League\\", a short story by Arthur Conan Doyle in which Sherlock Holmes waits in a bank vault to arrest a gang who have tunnelled in through the floor. Gavin and his colleagues rented Le Sac, a leather goods shop two doors from the bank, and tunnelled during weekends. The interior of the vault was mapped out by one gang member using an umbrella and the span of his arms to measure the dimensions and location of the furniture. The gang initially tried to use a jack to force a hole in the vault floor and when this failed they used a thermal lance. When this also failed to work, they used gelignite to blast a way through. Once inside, they emptied 268 safety deposit boxes. The gang had posted a lookout on a nearby roof, who was in contact via walkie-talkie, and their broadcasts were accidentally overheard by Robert Rowlands, an amateur radio enthusiast. He called the police, who initially did not take him seriously, so he used a small cassette recorder to make a recording of the burglars' conversations. The second time he contacted the police they accepted what he was saying, and began hunting for the burglars while the break-in was in progress. They searched 750 banks in an radius, but failed to locate the gang. Police found the members of the gang soon after the break in; one of the burglars, Benjamin Wolfe, had signed the lease for Le Sac in his own name and informers provided information that led to Gavin. At the end of October 1971 police arrested Wolfe, Gavin, Reg Tucker and Thomas Stephens. They continued to search for other members of the gang, including one woman, for five years, but no further arrests were made. Gavin, Tucker and Stephens were sentenced to twelve years in prison; Wolfe received a sentence of eight years, less than the others as he was in his 60s. There have been several rumours connected with the burglary, including one that the government issued a D-Notice to censor the press; that one of the safety deposit boxes contained compromising photographs of Princess Margaret and the actor and criminal John Bindon; and that photographs of a Conservative cabinet minister abusing children were found. There is no evidence to support them and they have been widely dismissed. Some of the rumours inspired the story for the 2008 film The Bank Job. Many of the papers relating to the burglary remain under embargo at The National Archives until January 2071. Background Lloyds Bank, 187 Baker Street In 1970 Anthony Gavin, a 38-year-old photographer from North London, began planning the burglary of the branch of Lloyds Bank at 187 Baker Street, in the Marylebone district of the City of Westminster, London. He decided to use a nearby premises and tunnel up into the floor of the bank; the plan was inspired by \\"The Red-Headed League\\", a short story by Arthur Conan Doyle. In the story, Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson pre-empt the burglars and are in the vault when they break in. A former army physical training instructor with connections to several career criminals, Gavin is described by the journalists Tom Pettifor and Nick Sommerlad as \\"a forceful personality ... [who] had the propensity to be physically threatening\\". According to Paul Lashmar, the head of journalism at the University of Sussex, Gavin was a member of a gang headed by Brian Reader, who was also involved in the burglary, although Reader firmly denies that he had any involvement in the events at Baker Street. Prelude Gavin asked Reg Tucker, a second-hand-car salesman, who had no criminal record, to reconnoitre the bank. Tucker opened an account with ¬£500 in December 1970 and two months later he rented a safety deposit box in the branch; over the next few months he visited his box thirteen times. Bank practice of the time was for staff to leave customers in private while visiting the vault. As soon as Tucker was alone, he would measure the room using the span of his arms and an umbrella he brought with him; he was aided in getting exact measurements by the regularly sized floor tiles, each of which was square. He drew a map of the room, plotting where the cabinets were and the position of the furniture. Thomas Stephens, another second-hand car salesman with no criminal record, was used to acquire the tools needed for the break-in, including a thermal lance and a 100-ton jack; one of Reader's friends, Bobby Mills, was employed to be the lookout man. Two others were brought in for the job, one of whom was an explosives expert. Another of Gavin's friends, Mickey \\"Skinny\\" Gervaise, a burglar-alarm expert, was brought on board, as were two men who have never been identified: \\"Little Legs\\" and \\"TH\\". Lashmar reports that TH was a contact of Detective Inspector Alec Eist, whom he describes as \\"by reputation the most corrupt Yard officer of the 1950s to mid-1970s\\". The journalist Duncan Campbell describes Eist as \\"One of the most active bent officers from the 1950s to the 1970s\\". In May 1971 the owners of the leather goods shop Le Sac at 189 Baker Street‚Äîtwo doors down from the bank‚Äîsold the lease of the property for ¬£10,000 to Benjamin Wolfe, a 64-year- old seller of ornaments and knick-knacks, and a contact of several gang members. The property had a basement that, the group calculated, was at the same level as the bank vault. Burglary The spoil and equipment left in Le Sac after the burglary Road works nearby meant the trembler alarms in the vault floor were turned off after several false alarms. A member of the local security company alerted the gang of the timing of the digging and when the alarms were off. Work began on the tunnel on the Friday evening of the August bank holiday 1971 and continued until 10 September 1971. To avoid being overheard, they dug only during the weekends. Gavin led the digging of the tunnel from Le Sac to under the vault floor. He later said that he lost in the process. The entry hole he, Tucker and a third gang member created in Le Sac was wide and through of concrete. Gavin dug until he reached the walls of the Chicken Inn's basement, then dug down and continued under the building, using their basement floor as the roof of the tunnel. The tunnel was long when finished, and at the end, under the vault, the gang created a cavity . The digging created of waste, which was hauled back into Le Sac and dumped towards the rear of the premises. The tunnel, which needed no supports, was later described in court as \\"a magnificent piece of engineering\\". The gang began their entry into the vault on Friday 10 September, after the bank closed for the weekend. The gang placed a lookout man on a rooftop overlooking the bank, and kept in contact by using walkie-talkies. Their intention was to use the 100-ton jack to force a hole in the reinforced concrete floor, and railway sleepers were laid on the floor to support it. What they did not know was that there was an old well under where the tunnel ended, and the pressure of the jack pushed the bottom of their tunnel down into the well, rather than raising the vault's floor upwards. The gang then used the thermic lance in an attempt to cut through the floor; when this failed they drilled holes in the underside of the vault floor and packed them with gelignite. On Saturday the gang co- ordinated the blast of the explosives with the movement of traffic in the area to mask the noise. A hole was blasted through the floor and into the vault. The tunnel was cleared of the debris created, and the hole was widened with a hammer and chisel. By the time they had finished, the exit of the tunnel measured . At around 11:00 pm on Saturday 11 September Robert Rowlands, an amateur radio enthusiast living in a flat in Wimpole Street, half a mile (800 m) away from the Lloyds branch, picked up the walkie-talkie conversations of the gang in error. He heard comments over the radio that made him think a local cigarette shop was being burgled. At 11:30 pm, he phoned the police; the local police officer thought it was a prank call, and told Rowlands that he should record the conversation if anything interesting was overheard. Rowlands thought it was a good idea, so used a small cassette recorder to make a record of the conversations. At around midnight he recorded dialogue between the gang inside the shop and the nearby lookout about their need to take a break: > First voice: Right, well listen carefully. We want you to mind for one hour > from now until approximately one o'clock and then to go off the air, get > some sleep and come on the air with both radios at six o'clock in the > morning. > Second voice: I suggest we carry on tonight, mate, and get it done with. > First voice: Look, the place is filled with fumes where we was cutting. And > if the Security come in and smell the fumes we are all going to take stoppo > and none of us have got nothing. Whereas this way we have all got 300 grand > to cut up when we come back in the morning. And if Security have naused it > for us, well at least we have got something. The disagreement between the lookout and gang continued for a while, and the lookout said \\"Money may be your God, but it's not mine, and I'm fucking off!\\" Eventually, after input from a woman's voice and a fourth person who seemed to carry more sway than the others, the lookout agreed to remain on the roof overnight. The lookout man was also given an update on the progress they had made in opening the safety deposit boxes: \\"We have done 90 per cent of the easy ones and we now face the hard ones.\\" thumbupright=1.4Relevant locations for the burglary: 10px ‚Äì Lloyds Bank, 187 Baker Street 10px ‚Äì Approximate location of Robert Rowlands's flat in Wimpole Street At 2:00 am Rowlands decided he had enough material recorded to call the police again; he did not recontact his local station, but phoned Scotland Yard directly. Scotland Yard sent members of the Flying Squad to listen to the tapes, and they confirmed that they thought a burglary was taking place. The officers stayed with Rowlands until 8:30 am on Sunday 12 September when the gang returned to the shop and radioed the lookout. One of the gang members in the shop thanked him for staying on the roof all night and informed him that they planned to finish the job early that afternoon. At one stage in the morning a waiter from the Chicken Inn restaurant heard noises from within the bank and peered through the windows of the building to see if anything could be seen. Shortly afterwards Rowlands and listening policemen heard the final radio broadcast \\"Would you like to change to the other channel, over\\". Rowlands thinks this was the code for leaving the bank. Police contacted bank staff and local security firms to open up their branches as they began to check 750 banks in an radius. Each branch was visited by both bank staff and police. They visited the Baker Street branch of Lloyds at 3:30 pm on 12 September. They found the vault secure; they were unable to open the vault to check as it was time locked. It is not known if the gang were still in the vault at the time, although police suspect that they were, but keeping quiet following a warning from the lookout. During the burglary 268 safety deposit boxes were opened, about a quarter of the boxes present; the gang did not try to crack the bank's safe. Lord Hailsham owned one of the boxes in the bank; at the time of the robbery he was Lord Chancellor, the most senior member of the judiciary. Estimates of the amounts stolen vary between ¬£150,000 and nearly ¬£4 million. Because of the way the gang communicated the burglary was soon nicknamed \\"the walkie-talkie job\\". Although the common name for the events is the \\"Baker Street Robbery\\", it is legally defined as a burglary. A Dictionary of Law by the Oxford University Press defines robbery as \\"The offence of using force against any person, or putting them in fear of being subjected to force, in order to commit a theft\\"; burglary is defined as \\"The offence, under the Theft Act 1968, of ... entering a building ... with the intention of committing one of three specified crimes in it ... [including] theft.\\" Aftermath=Investigation= Initially a news blackout was imposed on the radio messages to avoid letting the burglars know their conversations had been overheard by the police, but this was lifted by Monday 13 September. On that morning bank staff opened the vault and found that they had been burgled. Police found the thermal lance, walkie-talkies and other tools, including an oxyacetylene torch, in the shop. Eight hundred pieces of evidence were logged and forensically examined. Police announced that they were searching for four men and a woman. They thought that during the burglary the woman was acting as a controller, based in a different location to the lookout and the gang. The police later widened their search to include five others. The bank provided the police with the names of 260 box owners; eight others refused to allow their names to be passed on. Up to 120 detectives worked on the case, organised into four teams: one examining the scene, one contacting the known safety box owners, one covering the co-ordination from the control centre and one team dealing with all external enquiries. Police soon identified Wolfe from the lease documents, and within four days the police had a list of likely suspects that they were investigating. Informers provided the first names of two of the gang members and incomplete details of a pub that had been taken over by another member. Police made the connection between a newly acquired pub and Gavin. After several weeks of surveillance and investigation police had identified Wolfe, Gavin, Stephens and Tucker as the key individuals to arrest, but they also wanted to speak to three of four other people who they thought were involved. One of those they were interested in had been living in France and Italy since October 1971; there were no extradition agreements in place to request overseas police arrange for his return to Britain. Towards the end of October 1971 police surveillance teams saw Tucker hand over a bag to two men, Abdullah Hashan Gangji and his nephew Ackbar Mohammad Ali Gangji. The two were arrested and ¬£32,000 of notes were seized. Wolfe, Gavin, Stephens and Tucker were also picked up within the next two days. Police recovered ¬£231,000 they identified as stolen from the vault. After the end of the investigation Scotland Yard considered prosecuting Rowlands under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1967 for listening to unlicensed transmissions, but no charges were laid against him. Shortly after the court case, Lloyds Bank sent him a cheque for ¬£2,500 to thank him for his actions. =Court case= The two Gangjis were remanded in custody until 16 November, when bail was set at ¬£75,000. Tucker, Gavin and Stephens were all remanded on bail of ¬£30,000 each on charges relating to the break in. Shortly afterwards the bank's insurers offered a ¬£30,000 reward for information that would lead to more arrests. The trial of the four gang members and the two Gangjis opened on 2 January 1973. Stephens, Tucker, Wolfe and Gavin were charged with breaking into the bank and stealing the contents of the security boxes‚Äîvalued at a minimum of ¬£1.5 million‚Äîand of possessing explosives; the two Gangjis were charged with handling stolen goods. Stephens, Tucker and Gavin pleaded guilty, Wolfe and the two Gangjis pleaded not guilty. The two Gangjis stated that they were acting as a courier for a Swiss-based finance house involved in purchasing sterling. Wolfe claimed that after he signed the lease for Le Sac, he had only returned to the shop once, to pick up the post, and that he was shocked to hear the news about the break in. The trial ended on 23 January 1973 and sentences were handed down three days later. The two Gangjis were found not guilty, Stephens, Tucker and Gavin were each given sentences of twelve years; Wolfe received eight years‚Äîshorter than the others on account of his age. =Lloyds= In March 1973, 64 of those whose safety deposit boxes had been broken into sued Lloyds for ¬£500,000. The case opened in the High Court in 1977, by which time there were 138 plaintiffs seeking damages of ¬£660,000. One witness, a retired jeweller, recounted how he identified some of his property by walking around tables on which several items were placed; he and twenty other people were unsupervised while they did this. He noticed a single diamond that could easily have been stolen, which he estimated was worth between ¬£3,000 and ¬£4,000 at the 1971 price. Another customer complained that he saw a ring in a wastepaper bin, that it was too easy to steal some of the smaller items, if one wished, and that one of the bank assistants had told him that two people had tried to claim the same pair of candlesticks. Four days into the trial, the judge visited the bank and the rooms where the property had been on show. The following day he adjourned the case; no reason was given and no date to resume proceedings was set. Rumours There have been several rumours circulating about the burglary. One is that the government issued a D-Notice‚Äîa formal request that the media do not publish a story on a specific subject for reasons of national security‚Äîto stop any news being released. The claim is dismissed by Duncan Campbell who writes \\"no D-Notice was even requested, far less granted\\"; the journalist Graeme McLagen observes that there was a news embargo on the Sunday‚Äîwhile the burglary was still in progress‚Äîbut that the events were widely reported over the following days. Another rumour is that one of the safety deposit boxes contained compromising photographs of Princess Margaret and the actor and criminal John Bindon. Campbell describes the story as \\"cheerful nonsense\\". A third rumour is that photographs of a Conservative cabinet minister abusing children were discovered by the gang and left behind for the police to find, but no action was taken. Legacy Scene of the Hatton Garden safe deposit burglary in 2015 In 1976 James Humphreys, a Soho-based pornographer and strip club owner, alleged that police officers had stolen ¬£1 million worth of gems \\"as their share\\" of the burglary. The following year Commander Bert Wickstead, a senior officer at Scotland Yard, was appointed to head an inquiry into the allegations. In 2011 The Baker Street Robbery, a documentary on the burglary, was broadcast on The History Channel; the programme included an interview with Robert Rowlands and the recordings he made of the robbery. A fictionalised version of the burglary is the subject of the 2008 film The Bank Job, which uses the storyline that the crime was either set up‚Äîor later covered up‚Äîby MI5 to secure the compromising photographs of Princess Margaret, that were being kept in a deposit box at the bank by Trinidadian radical Michael X. The advertising for the film played up many of the rumours, both fuelling and reinforcing them: > [the gang] ... looted safe deposit boxes of cash and jewellery worth > millions and millions of pounds. None of it was recovered. Nobody was ever > arrested. The robbery made headlines for a few days and then disappeared ‚Äì > the result of a UK Government 'D' Notice, gagging the press. This film > reveals what was hidden in those boxes. The story involves murder, > corruption and a sex scandal with links to the Royal Family ‚Äì a story in > which the thieves were the most innocent people involved. The 2015 Hatton Garden safe deposit burglary bears a close resemblance to the break in at Baker Street. It was headed by Brian Reader, was carried out over a weekend and involved breaking into a vault containing safety deposit boxes, although in this case the burglars used a heavy-duty drill to enter through a wall. Although many of the records relating to the burglary at the bank were released by The National Archives in 2013, approximately 800 pages of information remain closed; they will be available for viewing in January 2071.

V. Wedgwood, 1946) refers to the burning of heretics by the Inquisition. Publication history The book manuscript was finished in 1931, and the book was published in 1935, by Herbert Reichner in Vienna (Canetti's hometown at that time). It is Canetti's first publication. In 1943 Canetti got an offer to publish the book in English with Jonathan Cape, but it was decided to delay publication until after the war. It was eventually released in 1946. The book did not become widely known until after the worldwide success of Canetti's Crowds and Power (1960). Jonathan Spence observes that \\"there is nothing discreet, chaste, or high minded about the finest and wildest of all fictions that centre on a student of China, Canetti's Auto-da-fe.\\" \\"Twentieth Century Chinese Fictions,\\" in Robin Winks, ed., Asia in Western Fiction (Manchester University Press, 1990), 112 Plot and themes The novel is a dark and disorienting tale of the self-destructive character of totalitarian thinking. A writer for the Spectator described it as: \\"Appalling, magnificent ... [It] screams and bellows of evil, out of which a supremely mad, unfaceable book is orchestrated ... of which we dare not deny the genius.\\"Canetti, Elias, \\"Auto-da-F√©\\", trans. C. V. Wedgewood, Continuum, 1981, New York, NY, fourth cover The protagonist is Herr Doktor Peter Kien, a famed and famously reclusive forty-year-old philologist and Sinologist who is uninterested in human interaction or sex, content with his monkish, highly disciplined life in his book-lined apartment in Vienna. He uses the least amount of furniture possible, to make room for his pacing through his lofty rooms, sleeping on a small divan. He holds books at a higher value than human life, and becomes obsessed with the protection of his library, which he fancies the largest private library in the city: > He himself was the owner of the most important private library in the whole > of this great city. He carried a minute portion of it with him wherever he > went. His passion for it, the only one which he had permitted himself during > a life of austere and exacting study, moved him to take special precautions. > Books, even bad ones, tempted him easily into making a purchase. > Fortunately, the great number of the book shops did not open until after > eight o'clock.Elias Canetti, Auto da F√©, Jonathan Cape, 1971, p. 11 Kien categorically rejects the ignominiousness and immorality of working for money, and has been living on an inheritance from his father for over a decade. He publishes an article or two every few years, to the delight of the larger European academic community. He is constantly prevailed upon to accept various academic posts, but is absorbed in his studies and shuns social and physical contacts. He is obsessive-compulsive in his efforts to avoid contamination, and much of the book is a tortured comedy of his descent into madness and being thrown into close contact with a world that he doesn't understand: \\"You draw closer to truth by shutting yourself off from mankind\\" (Canetti, 15). The novel begins with a conversation between Kien and a schoolboy in the street, who shows keen interest in Chinese texts. Kien consequently invites the boy to see his library. He immediately regrets the invitation and when the boy comes, Kien's housekeeper, Therese, boots the boy out of the apartment. Kien is grateful to her and admires such staunch enforcement of the rules surrounding his library. She shows interest in learning, and he begrudgingly lends her the most beat up book in his collection, believing she would defile the nicer editions. When he sees that she treats it with greater deference even than he, he decides to marry her, imagining that his library is in very good hands. On the way home from the marriage ceremony, Kien, a virgin, has brief but intense fantasies about consummating the marriage, revealing his ignorance of sex as well as disturbing ideas about women (misogyny is one of the most pervasive themes in the book, usually to the degradation and downfall of the characters, though not explicitly condemned by the narrative): > But Kein was surreptitiously contemplating the skirt ... Her skirt was a > part of her, as the mussel shell is a part of the mussel ... They have to be > trodden on, to be trampled into slime and splinters, as he had done once > when he was a child at the seaside ... He had never seen one naked. What > kind of animal did the shell enclose with such impenetrable strength? He > wanted to know, at once: he had the hard, stiff-necked thing between his > hands, he tortured it with fingers and finger-nails; the mussel tortured him > back ... Soon he had the creature stark naked on the ground, a miserable > fleck of fraudulent slime, not an animal at all.Canetti, Elias, \\"Auto-da- > F√©\\", trans. C. V. Wedgewood, Continuum, 1981, New York, NY, p. 54 Kien's comparison of Therese's skirt with a mussel shell is one of the first shocking psychological revelations in the book. But when Therese arrives in a thin white slip, she thrusts the books onto the floor to make room. Kien runs to lock himself in the bathroom and weeps bitterly, for the abuse of the books (as well as his having been wrong about Therese, presumably) (Canetti, 59). Thus begins Kien's steep psychological decline. Within days of marriage, the two enter a violent and divided existence, and Kien becomes deeply agitated when cut off from three-quarters of his library to accommodate a separate living space for his bride. After a violent encounter with her, the building's concierge, Benedikt Pfaff (an ex-policeman), offers to beat her to death (Canetti, 111-112). Therese ultimately forces Kien out entirely. He is deeply bereaved, since to him the books are more important than people: > Books have no life; they lack feeling maybe, and perhaps cannot feel pain, > as animals and even plants feel pain. But what proof have we that inorganic > objects can feel no pain? Who knows if a book may not yearn for other books, > its companions of many years, in some way strange to us and therefore never > yet perceived?\\" (Canetti, 67). Canetti, p. 67 The rest of the book is a disturbing series of interconnected incidents of violence and mental, social and sexual depravity. Each character is driven entirely by a desperate need for one thing (being chess champion, having a library, being rich, etc), to the point of entering into a state of war against anything that might remotely stand in the way of its realization. In a way, each character represents the totalitarian mindset, always to their bitter undoing. Every character seems to present a type of insanity, with the exception of Georges Kien, who in fact venerates insanity, to the point of regarding it as superior, even holy (Canetti, 401-405). It is this very man who appears to be coming to save his brother and sort out the mess of Therese and Pfaff, but arrogantly underestimates the depth of Peter's disease, and so fails to prevent the ultimate catastrophe. Kien descends to the criminal underbelly of Vienna, befriending a dwarf named Fischerle, who dreams of defrauding Kien and travelling to America to become chess champion. Fischerle ends up sending a telegram to Kien's brother, Georges, a famous psychiatrist in Paris. Georges tries in vain to cure him, perhaps reflective of the author's antagonistic stance toward Freudian psychoanalysis. Canetti's friend, the sculptor Fritz Wotruba, felt that the character was modelled on Canetti's brother Nessim, who at the time lived in France, worked for Polydor Records and was an impresario for French chanson through the nightclub he ran there. \\"Hadn't I, he asked me, gone wrong out of love for my younger brother, whom I had told him about? No one, he insisted, could have so many skins; I had constructed an ideal character; what a writer does in his books, Georges Kien did in his life ...\\".From Elias Canetti, Das Augenspiel: Lebensgeschichte 1931-1937 (1985); translated as The Play of the Eyes (New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1987).

The term has also been used to refer to biological processes in the evolution of hominids, particularly humans and bonobos, toward collaborative (\\"tamer\\") behavior and control of reproduction. In animals Wild animals may self-domesticate when tame behaviour enhances their survival in the vicinity of human beings. Tolerating or even enjoying the close proximity of humans in order to feed near them, and a lessening of natural adult aggression, are two aspects of tameness. An environment that supports the survival of tame animals can lead to other changes in behaviour and appearance as well. Smaller skulls on tame animals have been noticed in other species. Noticing that a dog's skull looks like that of a juvenile wolf, British primatologist Richard Wrangham goes on to say that \\"this leads to the thought that species can self-domesticate.\\" However, the evolutionary biologist Abbey Drake has found that \\"dogs are not paedomorphic wolves.\\" Other characteristics that are associated with juvenility such as barking and meowing (sounds used by wolf cubs and kittens of large felines, respectively, to communicate with their parents), increased playfulness and reduced aggression, may also be seen in tame animals. =Cats= Self-domestication is described by biological anthropologist Richard Wrangham as being in an environment where lessening of aggression was beneficial for survival. As grain plants and livestock became domesticated 9,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, wild cats adapted to living with humans, hunting rodents in grain stores and \\"abandoning their aggressive wild- born behaviors\\", which led to today's house cats. =Dogs= While humans may have intentionally domesticated wolves into dogs, an alternate hypothesis is that wolves effectively domesticated themselves by establishing a mutually beneficial relationship with prehistoric humans. They scavenged on the remains of the prey animals left by the prehistoric people at the human settlements or the kill sites. Those wolves that were less anxious and aggressive thrived, continued to follow the prehistoric humans, and colonized the human-dominated environments, generation after generation. Gradually, the first primitive dogs emerged from this group. =Primates= The evolutionary anthropologist Brian Hare proposes that bonobos (Pan paniscus), close relatives of the chimpanzee, have undergone self-domestication, in the hominid evolutionary sense. In humans Self-domestication theories describe how humans developed and evolved. \\"Contemporary reproductive technologies such as selective abortion and genetic screening are typical examples where our self-domestication is most directly apparent\\", writes philosopher Masahiro Morioka, who also says that \\"Through domesticating ourselves like cattle, people began civilization.\\"Painless Civilization: A Philosophical Critique of Desire by Masahiro Morioka, Transview Publications, Tokyo, 2003, , (in Japanese); translation by Kenny Gundle and Masahiro Morioka on website http://www.lifestudies.org/painless01.html, accessed 28 Oct 2008 Gregory Stock, director of the UCLA School of Medicine's Program of Medicine, Technology and Society, describes self-domestication as a process which \\"... mirrors our domestication [of animals] ... we have transformed ourselves through a similar process of self-selection ... our transformation has been primarily cultural, but it has almost certainly had a biological component.\\" Clark & Henneberg argue that during the earliest stages of human evolution a more paedomorphic skull arose through self-domestication. This assertion is based upon a comparison of the skull of Ardipithecus and chimpanzees of various ages. It was found that Ardipithecus clustered with the infant and juvenile species. The consequent lack of a pubertal growth spurt in males of the species and the consequent growth of aggressive canine armoury was taken as evidence that Ardipithecus evolved its paedomorphic skull through self domestication. As the authors state, comparing the species with Bonobos: Of course A. ramidus differs significantly from bonobos, bonobos having retained a functional canine honing complex. However, the fact that A. ramidus shares with bonobos reduced sexual dimorphism, and a more paedomorphic form relative to chimpanzees, suggests that the developmental and social adaptations evident in bonobos may be of assistance in future reconstructions of early hominin social and sexual psychology. In fact the trend towards increased maternal care, female mate selection and self-domestication may have been stronger and more refined in A. ramidus than what we see in bonobos. Further research has confirmed that Ardipithecus possessed paedomorphic cranial base angulation, position of the foramen magnum as well as vocal tract dimensions. This was interpreted as not only evidence of a change in social behavior but also a potentially early emergence of hominin vocal capability. If this thesis is correct then not only human social behavior but also language ability originally evolved through paedomorphic skull morphogenesis via the process of self-domestication. The most comprehensive case for human self-domestication has been proposed for the changes that account for the much later transition from robust humans such as Neanderthals or Denisovans to anatomically modern humans. Occurring between 40,000 and 25,000 years ago, this rapid neotenization has been explained as the result of cultural selection of mating partnersBednarik, Robert G. (2008). \\"The Domestication of Humans\\". Anthropologie. 46 (1): 1-17. on the basis of variables lacking evolutionary benefits, such as perceived attractiveness, facial symmetry, youth, specific body ratios, skin tone or hair, none of which play any role in any other animal species. This unintentional auto-domestication, coinciding with the introduction of imagery of female sexuality, occurred simultaneously in four continents then occupied by hominins. It led to rapid changes typical for domestication, such as in cranial morphology, skeletal architecture, reduction in brain volume, to playful and exploratory behavior, and the establishment of thousands of deleterious conditions, syndromes, disorders and illnesses presumed absent in robust humans.Bednarik, Robert G. (2011). The Human Condition. Springer, New York, pp. 127-141. . This hypothesis effectively replaces the Replacement Hypothesis (known as \\"African Eve theory\\") and explains the relatively rapid transition as a culturally induced domestication process still continuing today. It also explains the rise of exograms and their role in selecting for competence in the use of external memory traces. The idea of self-domestication was used by early Social Darwinism which, according to psychiatrist Martin Br√ºne in an article \\"On human self- domestication\\", developed from the idea that humans could perfect themselves biologically.

Early life Gao was born in Chongqing. She attended the Language and Literature Department at the Renmin University of China, where she majored in Literary Theory. Career Gao began her journalism career in 1979, as a reporter for the China News Service.Michael Kudlak, IPI World Press Freedom Heroes: Gao Yu, IPI Report, June 2000 In 1988, she became deputy chief editor of Economics Weekly, edited by dissident intellectuals. She also worked as a freelance journalist for different newspapers in China and in Hong Kong. In November 1988, she published an article in Hong Kong's Mirror Monthly, which was described by Beijing's Mayor Chen Xitong as a \\"political program for turmoil and rebellion\\". He even branded her as a \\"people's enemy\\". She was arrested in 1989, after the Tiananmen Square protests, and released 15 months later because of health problems. Gao was arrested again in October 1993, and in November 1994 was sentenced to six years, accused of having \\"published state secrets\\". In February 1999, she was given parole in poor health.\\"China: Update Medical Letter Writing Action: Gao Yu\\". Amnesty International, 5 March 1999 In 2014, Gao was arrested again a few weeks ahead of the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. The detention of the outspoken 70-year-old journalist was just one of several detentions of government critics over the previous days ahead of the politically sensitive 4 June anniversary. In April 2015, Beijing's high court convicted Gao of leaking state secrets and sentenced her to seven years in prison. According to Reporters Without Borders, the authorities accused Gao of sending \\"Document Number Nine\\" to a foreign news organization, although the document had already been posted online.\\"Reporters Without Borders Reveals State Secrets In Reaction To Gao Yu‚Äôs Sentence\\". Reporters Without Borders, 17 April 2015 Following an appeal, her sentence was reduced to five years on 26 November 2015. Hours later, Chinese state media announced she has been released on medical parole, however the conviction for leaking state secrets was not overturned. As of 2016, she is serving a five-year sentence under house arrest. German president Joachim Gauck, on his first state visit to China in March 2016, raised the plight of Gao with the Chinese government. Gao once wrote for the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle. Days after Gauck's comments on Gao, Beijing municipal authorities and police raided her home, demolishing her study which they claimed was an illegal structure, and ransacking the rest of her home. Gao put up a fight but collapsed due to apparent high blood pressure. Gao stated that the raid was illegal and the authorities gave no advance notice. Sources claimed that the raid was conducted in retaliation for the German president's comments. Gao's home has been ransacked by the police before, when they came to arrest her in 2014. Awards While incarcerated, Gao Yu received the WAN- IFRA (World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers) Golden Pen of Freedom and the IWMF (International Women's Media Foundation) Courage in Journalism Award in 1995. In March 1999, she became the first journalist to receive the UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize.

It is a compact venue for smaller functions having a capacity for 100 people dancing and 50 people if seated. It has a small kitchen and access for people with disabilities.http://www.aylesburytowncouncil.gov.uk/vi-infopage.asp?infoid=614  History  The land is believed to have formerly been mainly farmland. The word ‚ÄòHaydon‚Äô may mean ‚Äòan enclosure‚Äô or ‚Äòa hedged in enclosure‚Äô, although the area has had the name written in variations such as 'Haydon', 'Heydon', 'Heyden' and 'Heydone' The earliest record of any human activity in the area was found in 1978 when the estate was under construction. A large amount of pottery, three pieces of burned bone and a fragment of a bronze ligula (small Roman spoonRoman cuisine) were found in the spoil cast up from a pipe trench being laid. The Ligula and pottery dates from the early Iron Age to 5th- century Roman.http://ubp.buckscc.gov.uk/ResultsDetails.aspx?uid=MBC11082 During the Roman period Akeman Street (which was a Roman road from London to Cirencester) passed through the eastern boundary of the estate. Akeman Street closely follows the line of the A41, Bicester Road. Most Roman roads were raised on a slight causeway, especially where they crossed wet ground, in order to provide drainage. This low bank or agger can often be traced even if the surfacing material (rammed chalk, gravel, iron slag or the like) has long since been denuded or covered by vegetation. At Haydon Hill there was a distinct Agger visible at the location of Haydon Hill Farm.http://ubp.buckscc.gov.uk/ResultsDetails.aspx?uid=MBC3193 Also on the estate Roman finds were made including a quantity of bones and large amounts of pottery found in 1897http://ubp.buckscc.gov.uk/ResultsDetails.aspx?uid=MBC816 and large amounts of pottery, spindle whorls etc. in 1923. In 1954 large amounts of pottery, a 3rd-century coin, spearheads and horseshoes.

Direction of arrival estimation using ESPRIT with sparse arrays.// Proc. 2009 European Radar Conference (EuRAD). ‚Äì 30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009. - Pp. 246 - 249. - as well. General description Let us define a signal vector as, a(w_k)=[1 \\\\quad e^{-jw_k} \\\\quad e^{-j2w_k} \\\\quad ... \\\\quad e^{-j(m-1)w_k}]^T where w_k represents the radial frequency of kth sinusoid. Let us construct a Vandermonde matrix for K number of sinusoids, such as A = [a(w_1) \\\\quad a(w_2) \\\\quad ... \\\\quad a(w_K)] Let us divide the matrix A into two sets, such as A_2 = [I_{m-1} \\\\quad 0] A and A_1 = [0 \\\\quad I_{m-1}] A where I_{m-1} is an identity matrix of size (m-1)-by-(m-1). It is clear that, A_1 contains the first (m-1) rows of A, while A_2 contains the last (m-1) rows of A. Now, let us write the following relation, A_2 = A_1 H Here, H is a diagonal matrix, where its diagonal elements can be written in a vector, such as, diag(H) = [e^{-jw_1} \\\\quad ... \\\\quad e^{-jw_K}] In other words, the diagonal elements of H, are the complex exponentials with the radial frequencies of the set \\\\\\\\{w\\\\\\\\}_{k=1}^K. Here, it is clear that H applies a rotation to the matrix A_1 . ESPRIT exploits similar rotations from the covariance matrix of the measured data. To understand the algorithm itself, let us denote R as the covariance matrix of the measured data. By computing the eigenvalue decomposition of R (via algorithms like singular value decomposition), the following can be written, R = U E V^* where E is a diagonal matrix that contains the eigenvalues of R, in a decreasing order. Here, by finding the eigenvalues that are higher than the variance of the noise, we can separate the orthonormal eigenvectors from U, that correspond to these eigenvalues. This can be noted as S = U(:,1:K) where we kept only the first K columns. As similar before, we can make the following separation on S, S_1 = [I_{m-1} \\\\; 0] \\\\; S and S_2 = [0 \\\\;I_{m-1}] \\\\; S . Moreover, there exists a relation between S and A such as S\\\\;=\\\\;A\\\\;F, where the content of the matrix F is known, but irrelevant for the current subject. We can derive the following relations, S_2 = A_2\\\\;F\\\\;=\\\\;A_1\\\\;H\\\\;F\\\\;=\\\\;S_1\\\\;F^{-1}\\\\;H\\\\;F\\\\;=\\\\;S_1\\\\;P (where we made use of S_1\\\\;=\\\\;A_1\\\\;F and A_1\\\\;=\\\\;S_1\\\\;F^{-1}). It is clear that the matrix P contains rotational information with respect to the frequency contents, such that the rotation on the first set of orthonormal eigenvectors yield to the second set. Moreover, the eigenvalues of P are equal to the diagonal elements of H. Therefore, by solving the following equation for P, S_2 = S_1 P we can estimate the frequency content. To achieve this, the above equation can be solved with pseudo inverse (via Least squares) method. To do so, P = (S_1^*S_1)^{-1}S_1^*S_2 can be written. Finally, by finding the angles of the eigenvalues of P, one can estimate the set \\\\\\\\{w\\\\\\\\}_{k=1}^K.

Claassen Verlag) Crowds and Power () is a 1960 book by Elias Canetti, dealing with the dynamics of crowds and \\"packs\\" and the question of how and why crowds obey power of rulers. Canetti draws a parallel between ruling and paranoia. Also, the memoirs of Daniel Paul Schreber are analyzed with an implicit critique of Sigmund Freud and Gustave Le Bon. The book was translated from German into English by Carol Stewart in 1962 and published by Gollancz. It is notable for its unusual tone; although wide- ranging in its erudition, it is not scholarly or academic in a conventional way. Rather, it reads like a manual written by someone outside the human race explaining to another outsider in concise and highly metaphoric language how people form mobs and manipulate power. Unlike much non-fiction writing, it is highly poetic and seething with anger. On asking questions: \\"On the questioner the effect is a feeling of enhanced power. He enjoys this and consequentially asks more and more questions; every answer he receives is an act of submission. Personal freedom consists largely in having a defense against questions. The most blatant tyranny is the one which asks the most blatant questions.\\"Crowds and Power, p. 285 This work remains important for the insights it provided into the Eastern European upheaval which can be understood within the framework Canetti puts forth.Kiss (2004), p.730 Showing the growth of crowds and their power against even the power of the state.

Public domain. John Robertson Reid (1851‚Äì1926) was a Scottish painter who spent his early working life in Surrey, and then from the early 1880s in Cornwall in the wild south-west of England. He became the president of the Society of British Artists in 1886 and the Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers in 1898. These posts gave him an entree into London society, and from the early 1900s he made his home in London. In Reid's later years, the young Sir Winston Churchill used to paint outdoors in the company of Reid. He trained under George Chalmers and William MacTaggart. His mature style was influenced by the move in painting toward rural Naturalism (Sir George Clausen) and the French Realists (Jules Bastien-Lepage) and also owes a little to Impressionism. He first found success with natural outdoor scenes of the Surrey countryside, and was notable at the time for painting his scenes entirely on location, with the use of hired local people posing in the scene. He also painted notable rural cricket match scenes, one of which now contain details of interest to cricketing historians. This is A Country Cricket Match, painted in the grounds at the rear of The Well House, West Sussex. His sisters, Lizzie Reid and Flora MacDonald Reid (1879-c.1929), were also exhibiting artists.

Biography = Early life = Welker was born in Poughkeepsie, New York on July 30, 1964 and raised in New York suburbia. When Welker was 13, his older brother, Steve, took him to the September 3, 1977 Grateful Dead concert at Raceway Park in Englishtown, New Jersey. With over 100,000 people in attendance, including New Riders of the Purple Sage and the Hell‚Äôs Angels, this early exposure to the psychedelic counterculture had a significant impact on Welker‚Äôs artistic eye and would influence his art moving forward. He later enrolled at Syracuse University to study painting, drawing, and illustration and graduated in 1986. Welker also credits the work of artists Jerome Witkin, Max Ernst, George Bellows, Thomas Hart Benton, and Robert Crumb as major influences in his formative years. = Early career (1986-1992) = After college graduation, Welker continued painting large-scale works to build a gallery portfolio. In 1988, Welker moved to Boston, Massachusetts, where he first saw the band Phish at the Paradise Club in 1989. When Welker moved to Manhattan two years later, he saw Phish again on March 19, 1992 at the Roseland Ballroom. This particular show resonated with him so much that he decided to reach out to Phish and share his artwork in hopes of a collaboration -- a decision that would forever change the course of Welker‚Äôs career. = Rift = At the same time as the Roseland Ballroom show in 1992, Welker‚Äôs artwork was being shown in a gallery on Broome Street in New York City. Welker selected two show cards from his gallery show, Staten Island Ferry and Levitator, and mailed them to Phish‚Äôs fan mail address with the message: ‚ÄúI would love for you to come to my show. I really enjoy your music‚Äù. Two weeks later, Welker returned home one day to Trey Anastasio‚Äôs voice on his answering machine asking him to return the call. Trey then explained that the band would like Welker to do the cover art for their upcoming album, Rift. Over the next few weeks, Welker would talk several times with Trey Anastasio and Mike Gordon about the specifics. Once Elektra Records and the band approved the artwork, it took Welker a total of four weeks to complete Rift. The final version of Rift, which is an oil-on-paper painting measuring 3‚Ä≤ x 6‚Ä≤, was purchased by Phish in 1996 and now hangs in the conference room at Phish headquarters in Burlington, Vermont. When Phish purchased the original Rift, they also commissioned Welker to do A Portrait of Mike Gordon. Welker has completed several additional Phish posters since then, including gig prints for Trey Anastasio and Mike Gordon‚Äôs side projects.

Simi Valley is a synclinal valley in Southern California in the United States. It is an enclosed or hidden valley surrounded by mountains and hills. It is connected to the San Fernando Valley to the east by the Santa Susana Pass and the 118 (Ronald Reagan) freeway, and in the west the narrows of the Arroyo Simi and the Reagan Freeway connect to Moorpark and Ventura, California. The relatively flat bottom of the valley contains soils formed from shales, sandstones, and conglomerates eroded from the surrounding hills of the Santa Susana Mountains to the north, which separate Simi Valley from the Santa Clara River Valley, and the Simi Hills.  Geology  California State Route 118 east of Simi Valley, seen westwardsSimi Valley borders the Santa Susana Mountains to the north and Simi Hills to the east and south. The valley covers an area of about 62 square miles in southern Ventura County, bordering the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles County. The Santa Clara River Valley occupies the northwestern corner of the valley. Mountainous terrain of South Mountain and Oak Ridge characterizes the northern and central area. Elevation within the quadrangle ranges from about 250 feet along the arroyo bottoms to over 2200 feet. Steep, highly dissected slopes form much of the boundary of the area. In the southeast, Little Simi Valley, drained by Arroyo Simi/Arroyo Las Posas, separates the southern flank of Oak Ridge from the Las Posas Hills. The Las Posas upland area, a broad elevated region that slopes gently to the south, separates the South Mountain-Oak Ridge highlands from the Las Posas-Camarillo Hills between Little Simi Valley on the east and the Oxnard Plain on the west. This relatively low-lying area is also referred to as the Las Posas Valley. Numerous north-south-trending drainages cut South Mountain and Oak Ridge creating steep narrow canyons on north-facing slopes and wide flat-bottomed canyons with incised streams on south-facing slopes. A network of residential streets and ranch and oilfield roads that traverse the area from U.S. Highway 101 and state highways 118, 23, and 126 provides access to the area. Current land use includes citrus and avocado orchards, oil well drilling and production, sand and gravel quarries, decorative-rock quarries, cattle grazing, suburban residential development, and golf courses. The oldest geologic unit mapped in the Simi Valley quadrangle is the upper Cretaceous Chatsworth Formation.Dibblee, T.W., and Ehrenspeck, H.E., ed. Geologic map of the Santa Susana quadrangle, Ventura and Los Angeles Counties, California The Sespe Formation consists of alluvial fan and floodplain deposits of interbedded pebble-cobble conglomerate, massive to thick-bedded sandstone, and thin-bedded siltstone and clay-stone. In the northern part of the map area, Sespe Formation is overlain by and inter-fingers with the upper Oligocene to lower Miocene Vaqueros Formation that is composed of transitional and marine sandstone, siltstone, and claystone with local sandy coquina beds. In the Las Posas Hills, Sespe Formation is unconformably overlain by marine sandstones of the middle Miocene Topanga Group that are interlayered with and intruded by basalt flows, breccia, and diabase dikes of the Conejo Volcanics.Darton, Nelson Horatio (1915). Guidebook of the Western United States. U.S. Government Printing Office. Pages 100-102.left Deep-marine strata of the upper Miocene Modelo Formation cover the Vaqueros Formation and Topanga Group along the crests and southern flanks of South Mountain and Oak Ridge. They also occur as isolated outcrops in the Las Posas Hills. Locally, Modelo Formation consists of interbedded diatomaceous shale, claystone, mudstone, and siltstone with minor sandstone, limestone, chert, and tuff beds. The most widely exposed rock units in the area are the Plio-Pleistocene marine and non-marine Pico and Saugus Formations that crop out on the southern flank of South Mountain-Oak Ridge. Locally, the Pico Formation consists of marine siltstone and silty shale with minor sandstone and pebbly sandstone. The Saugus Formation overlies and interfingers with the Pico Formation and is composed of interbedded shallow-marine to brackish water sandstone, siltstone, pebble-to-cobble conglomerate, and coquina beds that grade laterally and vertically into non- marine sandstone, siltstone, and conglomerate. A local member of the Saugus Formation is exposed in the southwest corner of the map area. It is predominantly a volcanic breccia conglomerate that resembles the Conejo Volcanics breccia, but is believed to represent remnants of landslide debris shed from the Conejo Volcanics into a local trough during Saugus time.Blake, Thomas F. (1991). Engineering geology along the Simi-Santa Rosa Fault system and adjacent areas, Simi Valley to Camarillo, Ventura County, California: field trip guidebook : 1991 Annual Field Trip, Southern California Section, Association of Engineering Geologists, Volume 2. Association of Engineering Geologists. Pages 209-267. Valley surficial deposits cover the floor and margins of the Little Simi Valley, Santa Clara River Valley in the north, and Arroyo Las Posas in the south, and extend up into the larger canyons that drain South Mountain and Oak Ridge. Extensive surficial deposits are also present in the Las Posas upland area in the southwest. These upper Pleistocene to Holocene sediments consist of older and younger alluvial fan and valley deposits, colluvium, active alluvial fans, and active stream deposits. Pleistocene- to Holocene-age landslide deposits are widespread throughout the Simi quadrangle, especially in the finer grained Tertiary sedimentary units where bedding planes are dip slopes. In addition, massive slumps are present in the Sespe and Vaqueros Formations on anti-dip slopes. Seismic and well data from the San Fernando Valley document evolution of that region from mid- Miocene rifting to north-south contraction. Formations in the western San Fernando Valley subsurface (Cretaceous to Paleogene strata, and Miocene Topanga and Modelo Formations) trace southward to outcrops in the Santa Monica Mountains that constrain faulting along the valley's south basin edge. Cretaceous strata in the Simi Uplift to the west are over 2 km higher than equivalent strata beneath the western San Fernando Valley across a boundary marked by the Chatsworth Reservoir fault, and Neogene thinning and off-lap. The Simi fault, located at the eastern end of the Simi-Santa Rosa fault system, bounds the northern margins of the Simi and Tierra Rejada Valleys. West of Simi Valley, the Simi fault has placed Miocene Conejo Volcanics over Plio-Pleistocene Saugus Formation rocks. The 15.5 ¬± 0.8 m.y.a. base of the Conejo Volcanics, identified in oil well logs, is inferred to have a dip-slip separation of about 425 to 550 m, suggesting a low long-term slip rate of about 0.03 mm/yr. However, substantial late Quaternary offset is suggested by the presence of more than 150 m of Pleistocene and younger alluvium that fills the east-west trending, down-dropped bedrock trough beneath western Simi Valley. In addition, trenching within faulted colluvial deposits in Tierra Rejada Valley has revealed evidence of multiple shears within Holocene deposits.http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1997/of97-259/ References * Valleys of Ventura County, California Simi Valley ","title":"Simi Valley (valley)"},{"id":"18593531","text":"The U.S. Highways in Utah are maintained by the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT).

There are of U.S. Highways in the state. The longest is U.S. Route 89 at and the shortest is U.S. Route 89A at . Six former U.S. Highways exist in the state of Utah; of these, five have been replaced by current interstate and U.S. Highways, while the other was replaced by a state route. The most recent change was the redesignation of U.S. Route 666 as U.S. Route 491 in 2003.

As such they predate the age of Neanderthals (by convention taken to have emerged 300,000 years ago), and are associated with Homo heidelbergensis. The spears support the practice of hunting by archaic humans in Europe in the late Lower Paleolithic. Shaft section The age of the spears was estimated from their stratigraphic position, \\"sandwiched between deposits of the Elsterian and Saalian glaciations, and situated within a well-studied sedimentary sequence.\\"Thieme, H. 1997: Lower Paleolithic hunting spears from Germany. Nature 385(27), 807-810. More recently, thermoluminescence dating of heated flints in a deposit beneath that which contained the spears suggested that the spears were between 337,000 and 300,000 years old.Richter, D. and M.

Discovery and location  Excavation site The littoral zone of a lake The site of the finds (Sch√∂ningen 13/II sedimentary sequence 4) is one of 13 Palaeolithic places of discovery in the open-cast, lignite mine (working area, south) that was excavated in the course of the prospection of the quaternary surface layer from 1992 to 2009. The excavation base that was excluded from coal mining represents a small segment of a former littoral zone. This zone has been visited over millennia, between the Elster- and Saale ice ages, by humans and animals alike. The pedestal displays five massive, layered sediment packages that were created by varying levels of the lake and silting-up processes. Thanks to the quick, airtight covering of the archaeological layers by mud, the organic materials are exceptionally well preserved. In the sequence of the sedimentary layers, climate changes can be read with a high resolution ‚Äì from a warm, dry phase to airy deciduous forests to tundra. The spears themselves are from an approximately wide and long strip, parallel to the former lake shore in the sedimentary layer four, the late Holstein- interglacial. The archaeological layers beneath have only been partially excavated and have been an objective of a research excavation by the DFG (German Research Association) since 2010. Together with the spears, some stone artifacts, chips as well as over 10,000 animal bones were found, which were 90% horse bones, followed by red deer and European bison.Voormolen B. 2008: Ancient Hunters, Modern Butcher Sch√∂ningen 13II -4, a kill-butchery site dating from the northwest European Lower Palaeolithic. Leiden The horse bones come from Equus mosbachensis and are indicative of at least 20 individuals. They show numerous cut marks made by stone tools, but only a few bite marks made by animals. The site is interpreted by the excavator Harald Thieme as testimony of a hunting event as well as the following cutting up and preparation of the kill. According to his scenario, the thick reeds at the lake shore gave the hunters cover, from where the horses, trapped between the hunters and the lake, were culled with accurate spear throws. Because there are bones of young animals among the horse bones, he concludes that the hunt took place in autumn.Musil R. 2007: Die Pferde von Sch√∂ningen: Skelettreste einer ganzen Wildpferdherde in: Thieme H.

Sirocko et al. (ed.): The Climate of Past Interglacials. Development in Quaternary Science Vol.7, S. 417-444  Other discoveries  More unique wooden artifacts were found at the place of discovery of the wild horse hunting camp: a charred wooden staff (skewer) as well as a wooden tool, tapered at both ends, interpreted as a throwing stick.Thieme H. 1999: Altpal√§olithische Holzger√§te aus Sch√∂ningen, Lkr. Helmstedt. Germania 77, S. 451-487 The stone tools at the place of discovery consist of different scraper-shaped and pointed forms. Evidence of blank production is missing; much retouched debris proves the reworking of the brought-along tools. Also among the finds are the so-called \\"grooved wooden tools\\", excavated at the place of discovery No. 12. Made from the extremely hard wooden branch-bases of the European silver fir, and noticeably incised at one end, they may have been used as a mounting for stone blades. If this interpretation is correct, they are the oldest composite tools of mankind. Thanks to the good preservation conditions at the place of discovery, there are many finds of small animals, among them small mammals, fish, mollusks and insects. Together with the carpological remains, they make a detailed reconstruction of the climate and the environment of the passing of an interglacial period possible. Significance Seven of the spears are made of spruce (Picea abies) wood Associated bone fossils The spears and the place of discovery have revolutionized the picture of the cultural and social development of early humans. Previously, the widespread opinion was that Homo heidelbergensis (and Neanderthals, regarded as a descendant of H. heidelbergensis) were simple beings without language that lived on plants and carrion. The spears and their correlated finds are evidence of complex technological skills and are the first obvious proof for an active (big game) hunt. It seems that H. heidelbergensis could hunt herd animals that can run faster than a human, and this suggests that they had sophisticated hunting strategies, a complex social structure and developed forms of communication (language ability). H. heidelbergensis therefore already had intellectual and cognitive skills like anticipatory planning, thinking, and acting, that up until then had only been attributed to modern humans.Thieme H. 2007.

T√ºbingen Since 2010, the excavations on top of the excavation base continued in the framework of a project by the Lower Saxony State Service for Cultural Heritage in Hannover and the Eberhard Karls University T√ºbingen, Department of Early Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology of the Institute of Pre- and Protohistory and Mediaeval Archaeology, supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Association).

In 2009, Lower Saxony allocated public funds from the increased funds for the economy package II for the construction of a research and development centre. The centre, close to the place of discovery, is devoted to the inter-disciplinary research of the Sch√∂ningen places of discovery, as well as to the Pleistocene archaeology, and presents the original finds in an experience-orientated, modern exhibition. The transparent research and laboratory area as well as an interactive visitor‚Äôs laboratory link the areas ‚Äúresearch‚Äù and ‚Äúmuseum‚Äù. A 24 hectare outdoor area presents typical plant communities of the interglacial, among them a pasture for wild horses. The place has been planned as an extracurricular place of learning. The building contractor was the town of Sch√∂ningen. Responsible for the conception and contextual planning was the Lower Saxony State Service of Cultural Heritage. The centre was opened at the beginning of 2013.  Controversy  Archaeologists at the University of T√ºbingen have questioned some of the initial interpretations of the site.Balter, Michael. 2014. The killing ground. Science 6 June 2014: 344 (6188), 1080-1083. DOI:10.1126/science.344.6188.1080 Isotope analysis and wear patterns on the horses' teeth show a wide variety of habitat and diet amongst the animals, indicating that the faunal assemblage accumulated in many small events, rather than one large slaughter. Sediment analysis shows that the red colour previously thought to be a result of hearths and burning are actually iron compounds forming as the lake levels dropped in recent times. Lake algae, sponges, and small crustaceans found in the sediments show that the spears were never on dry land and that the deposit has always been submerged. These data suggest that instead of representing a big hunting event, the spears suggest less social complexity than originally suggested. They also suggest that the horses were hunted in shallow water rather than at the lake edge.  Similar finds  Wooden artifacts from the Palaeolithic age are very rarely delivered to posterity. Beside Sch√∂ningen, finds are the Clacton Spear from Clacton-on-Sea (England),Oakley, K. P., Andrews, P., Keeley, L. H. u. Clark, J. D. 1977: A reappraisal of the Clacton spearpoint.

Wherry Yacht Charter originated as a business run by Peter Bower and Barney Matthews, first chartering their wherry yachts Olive and Norada, and later acquiring and restoring pleasure wherry Hathor. The Trust was established in 2002 and its stated aims are to restore, protect and sail the three Norfolk wherries Hathor, Olive and Norada, and to keep them together as the only remaining wherry fleet. Hathor was built in 1905 at Reedham, Norfolk as a private holiday vessel for the Colman's Mustard and Boardman families, a role she fulfilled until the 1950s. She was subsequently owned for a period by Claud Hamilton, author of Hamilton's Guides to the Broads, and later spent a period (dismasted) as a houseboat at Martham. She was purchased by WYC in 1985, and, after 2 years of restoration work was used for holiday and educational charters for over 20 years. After a Farewell Tour in 2009 she was laid up, and in 2013 was hauled out for a 2-year restoration. Her relaunch event in 2015 saw five wherries sailing on the River Ant at How Hill, and she now provides sailing opportunities and school visits in the summer season. Norada was built in 1912 at Wroxham and worked as a hire boat until 1950. After a time with private owners, which also saw a name change to Lady Edith, she was bought by Barney Matthews in 1964 and underwent extensive restoration. She was let out for charter again from 1984, and reverted to her original name on her 75th anniversary in 1987. From 2006 Norada was out of the water for restoration of the hull, and was relaunched in 2011. She is now used for private charters and public sailings. Olive was built in 1909 at Wroxham and worked as a hire boat until 1958. She had four more owners until she was restored by the Trust and used for educational charters. In 2005 she sank at her moorings but has undergone repair and restoration and was relaunched in 2013. She is now used for private charters and public sailings. The Trust obtained a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund to purchase the wherries (achieved in 2004), to give the public access to the boats, and to run environmental education programmes. Each year, in a sailing season from approximately Easter to October, the Trust offers a series of public sailing trips and wherry viewings, and makes the wherry yachts available for private charter. In recent years, the Trust has also acquired the use of two further wherries: White Moth (1912) and Ardea (1927), allowing further charter income to be generated.

The kindling model was first proposed in the late 1960s by Graham V. Goddard and colleagues. Although kindling is a widely used model, its applicability to human epilepsy is controversial. Method The word kindling is a metaphor: the increase in response to small stimuli is similar to the way small burning twigs can produce a large fire. It is used by scientists to study the effects of repeated seizures on the brain. A seizure may increase the likelihood that more seizures will occur; an old saying in epilepsy research is \\"seizures beget seizures\\". Repeated stimulation \\"lowers the threshold\\" for more seizures to occur. The brains of experimental animals are repeatedly stimulated, usually with electricity, to induce the seizures. Chemicals may also be used to induce seizures. The seizure that occurs after the first such electrical stimulation lasts a short time and is accompanied by a small amount of behavioral effects compared with seizures that result from repeated stimulations. With further seizures, the accompanying behavior intensifies, for example progressing from freezing in early stimulations to convulsions in later ones. The lengthening of duration and intensification of behavioral accompaniment eventually reaches a plateau after repeated stimulation. Even if animals are left unstimulated for as long as 12 weeks, the effect remains; the response to stimulation remains higher than it had been before. It has been reported that repeated seizure stimulation can result in spontaneous seizures, but studies have had conflicting findings on this question. In humans, some seizure disorders come to an end by themselves even after large numbers of seizures. However, in both human epilepsy and in some animal models, evidence suggests that a process like that found in kindling does occur. Historical perspective Already in the 1950s and 1960s, numerous authors recognized the seizure-inducing potential of focal stimulation. Here, Delgado and Sevillano demonstrated that repeated low-intensity stimuli to the hippocampus could lead to progressive increase of electrically evoked seizure activity. Yet, it was not until the late 1960s that Graham Goddard recognized the potential importance of this phenomenon and coined the term 'kindling'. Further research by Goddard on the characteristics of the kindling phenomenon led to his conclusion that kindling can be used to model human epileptogenesis, learning and memory. The publication of these results opened a completely new niche for epilepsy research and has stimulated a significant amount of studies on the subject of kindling and its relevance to human epilepsy.  New approaches  In 2019, a new model to develop kindling in the neocortex was developed using optogenetics (light) instead of passing electrical current.

After surviving war action and Pacific Ocean typhoons, and she returned home safely after the war with one battle star to her credit. Launched in Washington The wooden hulled net layer YN-60 was laid down on 19 December 1942 at Everett, Washington, by the Everett-Pacific Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company; named Baretta on 17 March 1943; launched on 9 October 1943; sponsored by Miss Evelyn Jaramo, the 11-year-old daughter of a shipfitter at the builder‚Äôs yard; reclassified AN-41 on 20 January 1944; and commissioned at her builder's yard on 18 March 1944, Lt. Comdr. Ravenel L. Collins, USNR, in command. World War II service=Assigned to Pacific Ocean operations= After fitting out, shakedown training out of San Pedro, California, and post shakedown repairs, the net laying ship sailed for Hawaii and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 29 June. On 20 July, the net layer was ordered to report to the Commander, Service Force, Pacific, for duty \\"in the forward areas\\" and loaded mooring and net gear into August. Sailing in Task Group (TG) 32.6 on 8 August, Baretta proceeded to the Solomon Islands and entered Gavutu Harbor near Guadalcanal on the 26th. She remained there until getting underway on 4 September to rejoin Task Group 32.6. After taking position in the convoy, Baretta proceeded toward the Palau Islands. The convoy reached Peleliu on 18 September, three days after the initial landings there. After receiving instructions near Orange Beach, Baretta escorted LST-661 to Kossol Passage, arriving on 22 September. There, she took on board the men and equipment of the fleet post office to be established at Peleliu. Underway again on 24 September, she reached that island later in the day and transferred her passengers to Leonard Wood (APA 12) the next morning. =Palau Islands operations= For the next four months, Baretta maintained net defenses in the Palaus. On 26 September, she commenced working on moorings in Saipan Town Harbor, Angaur, but was interrupted by an enemy air raid and, later by worsening seas that made the anchorage unsafe. In the afternoon of 29 September, she received a request for help from LCT 867, that had fouled a mine with her anchor. Baretta proceeded to the scene and stood by while the landing craft carefully cut her anchor cable and then crept away from the peril. Baretta resumed her work on moorings but, on 1 October, worsening weather forced her to stop. In the midst of a moderate gale the next morning, LCT-404 requested help for an LCM whose ramp had jammed in the down position. Baretta answered the call, towing the craft alongside stern first, and then into the lee of the island off Red Beach. When the LCM's ramp had been freed and secured, the landing craft proceeded under her own power to Red Beach. Later that day, Baretta retrieved an unmanned LCVP adrift in a seaway. She took the landing craft in tow, but the line parted and heavy seas prevented further attempts to salvage the LCVP. At 1022 on 4 October, Baretta was lying off Angaur Island when LCT-579 struck a mine 300 yards off shore. Baretta's motor launch sped to the scene with a rescue party and removed 11 injured men before the damaged craft sank. =Kossol Passage operations= Through the rest of 1944, Baretta repaired and supplied landing craft and helped to retrieve them when they broached or became stranded. After transferring gear on 3 January 1945, Baretta sailed to Kossol Passage and, following operations in that vicinity, got underway with Spangler (DE 696) on the 10th for the Caroline Islands. A submarine contact on 12 January enlivened the voyage, and a submarine alert soon after Baretta entered Ulithi lagoon sent everyone to general quarters before she had moored. Later that day, Baretta sailed for Eniwetok. On the 16th, her crew put out an engine room fire in little more than an hour; but it left her engines inoperable. As a result, Cliffrose (AN 42) towed her sister ship for the remainder of the voyage. Arriving on 21 January, Baretta spent five days under temporary repair alongside Oahu (ARG 5). She got underway under her own power on the 26th and reached Pearl Harbor on 8 February for major repairs which lasted into the spring. =Supporting Guam operations= The net layer departed Pearl Harbor on 16 April and proceeded via Eniwetok to Guam, arriving at Apra Harbor on 3 May. After discharging her cargo, Baretta reported to the Commander, Forward Area, Pacific, for temporary duty and sailed for Ulithi to relieve Viburnum (AN-57) that had been damaged by a mine. Baretta reached Ulithi on the 7th and, for the next three weeks, operated on the main net line there, \\"upending, repairing, and replacing the anti-torpedo panels.\\" She devised a new method of handling the nets, which both saved time and reduced the possibility of damage to the buoys. \\"The new overlap method,\\" according to her war diary, \\"proved quick and safe.\\" Baretta worked at Ulithi into late June, retrieving, rigging, and laying anti-torpedo net moorings, until getting underway for the Ryukyus on 28 June in a 16 ship convoy. Detached on 4 July when five miles west of the southern tip of Okinawa, Baretta proceeded independently to Kerama Retto to relieve Terebinth (AN 59). She and her sister ships then recovered the anchor legs of the fleet telephone moorings in Kerama Retto for transfer to Buckner Bay. Before proceeding to that place, Baretta assisted LCT-466 that had lost her ramp and taken a 10 degree list to starboard. Baretta built a wooden jury ramp, repaired the tank landing craft's leaking starboard ballast tank and shifted the cargo load to port. =Okinawa operations= The next afternoon, Baretta moved to the anchorage at Unten Ko, off northeastern Okinawa where she was protected from a raging typhoon. By the 21st, the storm had abated and finally Baretta moved to Buckner Bay. Upkeep and logistics occupied her for about a week. Then she joined Stagbush (AN-69) and Winterberry (AN-56), and together they laid the fleet telephone moorings in Buckner Bay on 27 and 28 July. On 1 August 1945, another typhoon forced her to seek shelter again. Underway at 0700, Baretta raced up the east coast of Okinawa, battered by a strong wind from the northeast. She rolled 30 degrees to each side before reaching the relatively tranquil waters of Katena Ko, a typhoon anchorage two miles south of Unten Ko. Baretta rode out the blow \\"anchored bow and stern with two auxiliary minesweepers tied alongside.\\" =Salvaging a Japanese midget submarine= After the storm passed, she proceeded with Catclaw (AN 60) to Uten Ko where they salvaged a Japanese midget submarine. Baretta returned to Buckner Bay on the 11th and, the next day, commenced net maintenance work south of the entrance gate at Buckner Bay. At 1700 on the afternoon of 14 August, all minecraft were \\"directed to be prepared for departure on one hour's notice.\\" At 0800 the next morning, Baretta was proceeding to the net line when she received word by radio notifying \\"...all ships present that Japan's surrender had been officially accepted and all offensive action was to cease.\\" =End-of-war operations= To prepare for the occupation of Japan, paths through the mine strewn approaches to the ports of debarkation had to be cleared. Such an effort required the support of ships like Baretta. On 4 September, the net layer proceeded to Unten Ko to load navigational gear to be used in marking the Kii Suido channel off the port of Wakayama. There she took on concrete \\"clump\\" anchors and navigational buoys before loading additional equipment at Buckner Bay. She reached the entrance to Kii Suido at noon on 11 September and stood into Wakayama in the wake of the second sweep unit. Two hospital ships and a U.S. 5th Fleet task group followed. The next morning, Fraser (DM 24) and Stagbush began laying channel buoys. Baretta later joined them, planting buoys at three mile intervals. Each of the net layers received a \\"well done\\" from Fraser. =Surviving in a typhoon= On the evening of the 16th, weather reports warned of an approaching typhoon; and, at 0920 on the 17th, \\"all ships received orders to be ready to get underway on 30 minutes notice.\\" After letting out more anchor chain, Baretta waited as the wind increased to force 6 by 1800. Dragging anchor, LCI-814 fouled the net layer's bow at 1855. Baretta backed down and released more chain, enabling the landing craft to free herself. During the night, the wind velocity increased until, at 0100 on the 18th, Baretta clocked it at between 81 and 89 knots. Yard and landing craft in her vicinity continually dragged anchors, but Baretta's bow anchor held. By 0730, the wind quieted to 30 knots, and Baretta headed for the lee of Awajii Island to avoid heavy swells coming from the northeast. The storm abated that afternoon, and Baretta returned to Wakanoura Wan and surveyed the devastation: three LST's and a YMS lay stranded on the northern beaches of the anchorage and a PBY \\"Catalina\\" seaplane had been sunk. On the 19th, the net layer replanted a mid channel radar buoy in Kii Suido which the typhoon had dragged some 500 yards away from its original position. =A gift of 30 cases of beer= An unusual assignment came next. While entering Kii Suido on 22 September, the battleship California (BB 44) had snagged a channel buoy in her streamed paravanes, taking it with her some 25 miles before she anchored. Baretta recovered the \\"kidnapped\\" buoy and received, in compensation, \\"thirty cases of beer from the BB....\\" Baretta spent the rest of the year laying and replanting buoys around the Ryukyus and in the Japanese home islands. She departed Japan on 29 December and proceeded via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor to the California coast. Post-war inactivation and disposal Baretta underwent pre-inactivation overhaul at the Mare Island Navy Yard and was decommissioned there on 4 April 1946. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 8 May 1946, but her ultimate fate remains obscure. One source indicates that she was acquired by Mr. O. Clive Webster, of Bermuda, on 20 January 1947. Yet, another suggests that she was transferred to the U.S. Maritime Commission and gives 24 January 1947 as the date on which that occurred. To add to the mystery, merchant registers do not mention the ship in their postwar issues.

Biography Edward Everett Rice was born in Brighton, Massachusetts to Edmund Rice and Martha A. (Fletcher) Rice. Rice married Clara E. Rich, daughter of Isaac E. Rich, in 1869 and they had a daughter Carrie B. Rice (b. 1870) and sons, Aubrey L. Rice (b. 1876) and Anthony D.

Sheet music cover from 1898 showing Edward E. Rice's Production of Clorindy featuring the song \\"Darktown is Out Tonight\\" Living in New York City in the early 1870s, Rice was employed as a clerk with the Cunard Steamship Company when he saw the English production of The Black Crook and became interested in the idea of creating an American musical. In 1874 Rice and J. Cheever Goodwin were the creators of an extravaganza, Evangeline; or, The Belle of Acadia, a musical burlesque of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's Evangeline, that became the first American production billed as a musical comedy.Chase, p. 362Green, Kay (ed.) \\"Evangeline\\", Broadway Musicals, Show by Show, Hal Leonard Corporation (1996) Rice composed the music for more than eighteen productions that appeared on Broadway, including Hiawatha and Summer Nights, that toured the country. Rice had no formal musical education and he could not read sheet music, but he played by ear on the piano. His method of composition would be to \\"dictate\\" to a scribe tunes that he would play on the piano, and he would make suggestions for orchestration. As a producer, Rice introduced popular performers Pauline Hall, Lillian Russell, and Fay Templeton, and in 1898, he booked Clorindy, or The Origin of the Cake Walk by Will Marion Cook and Paul Laurence Dunbar, one of the earliest musicals by African Americans and the first to appear on Broadway at the prestigious Casino Theatre.Woll, Allen (1989). Black Musical Theater. Louisiana State University Press. .Bernard L. Peterson, A Century of Musicals in Black and White: An Encyclopedia of Musical Stage Works By, About, or Involving African Americans (Greenwood Publishing Group, 1993), , pp. 84-85. Excerpts available at Google Books. Rice's biggest hit was 1894's Adonis, which starred Henry Dixey, one of the most popular performers of the era. He produced the \\"burlesque extravaganza\\" musical 1492 Up To Date in 1893 in New York City. Rice's final Broadway production was a 1904 revival of the British musical Mr. Wix of Wickham, with new songs by Jerome Kern. He died at the age of 76 in New York City.

He has been called \\"the American Offenbach\\".  Early life (1834-1873)  David Braham was born in London in 1834. As a young man, he aspired to become a professional musician and began studying the harp. However, because he was unable to get his bulky instrument on board a stagecoach, he later switched to the violin. He proved to be an adept violinist, performing in concerts at a young age. He was the uncle of John Joseph Braham Sr.\\"John J. Braham Dies; Composer of Music\\", The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, October 28, 1919 The Braham family immigrated to New York City when David was 15. Upon arriving in New York, Braham began working as a violinist in the orchestra accompanying the Pony Moore Minstrels. He also played in the pit orchestras of various New York auditoriums, headed an 18-piece orchestra at the New Canterbury concert saloon at 585 Broadway, and led a military band. The first Broadway musical to feature music by David Braham was Pluto, produced by William Horace Lingard at the Theatre Comique in 1869. Braham's success as a composer continued through the early 1870s, during which time he wrote numbers for such performers as James McKee, then-child star Annie Yeamans, and P. T. Barnum performer General Tom Thumb.  Harrigan and Hart (1873-1885)  Poster advertising The Mulligan Guard In 1873, David Braham collaborated with Edward Harrigan and Tony Hart on the song The Mulligan Guard, with music by Braham and lyrics by Harrigan. The song was presented on July 15, 1873 as part of a vaudeville sketch which featured Harrigan and Hart wearing unusual American Civil War-era military costumes. This collaboration marked the first of many between Braham, Harrigan, and Hart. From that point onwards, Braham became firmly associated with the two. Although he did go on to write melodies for other lyricists, his success in Broadway theater came almost entirely as a result of his Harrigan and Hart scores. In November 1876, Harrigan married Braham's daughter Annie. The success of The Mulligan Guard led to a series of burlesques which would become known as the \\"Mulligan plays\\". The Mulligan plays focused on the everyday life of New York City, appealing to a variety of racial groups, including Irish Americans, German Americans, and African Americans. The first of these Mulligan plays was The Mulligan Guard's Ball, followed by The Mulligan Guard's Picnic, The Mulligan Guard's Chowder, The Mulligan Guard's Christmas, and various others. Although most of the Mulligan plays followed the same naming pattern, the final two shows in the series were titled Cordelia's Aspirations and Dan's Tribulations. The Mulligan plays featured several popular songs, all of which were written by Braham, including The Pitcher of Beer and Hats Off to Me.  Late life (1884-1905)  The last Mulligan play to be produced was Dan's Tribulations on April 7, 1884. Shortly after it opened, the New Theatre Comique, at which many of the Harrigan and Hart shows had been produced, burned down. In 1885, Harrigan and Hart separated, and neither they nor Braham were ever able to singularly attain the same level of success that they had achieved as a team. David Braham died in 1905. On May 21, 1906, Harrigan produced a revival of Old Lavender, a musical he and Braham had written together. In 1985, a musical titled Harrigan 'n Hart was produced at the Longacre Theatre, featuring songs by Harrigan and Braham. Notes Further reading  Finson, Jon W., ed. (1997).

Keisha then got an opportunity to put out some albums, and in 1989, released her self-titled debut. The album scored a minor hit with its single, ‚ÄúHot Little Love Affair‚Äù which reached #39 on the charts. In 1991, Keisha released a second effort, titled Keisha, which had the single ‚ÄúMature Love.‚Äù The track failed to make a big impression and peaked at #80 on the R&B; charts. In the time after, Keisha began working with LaFace Records as a background vocalist. She worked on tracks with Toni Braxton, Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown. She became involved with a Warner Bros. Records plan to make a group called Black Coffy and was signed to the project. However, the group was dropped before ever making any real recordings. Today, Keisha continues to record and perform, and has started her own agency titled One Voice Entertainment. She performs often as a backup singer with Erykah Badu's band. Other Celebrity background include, Joss Stone, Angie Stone, OutKast, Faith Evans and many more.

It was fought between the Clan Donald and Clan Maclean. A tr√†igh or stand is the flat area of land bordering a body of water, a beach, or shoreline. History The Isle of Islay had belonged to Clan MacDonald whose leader was Sir James MacDonald, 9th of Dunnyveg, the son of Clan chief Angus MacDonald and who may have already imprisoned his father, and a nephew of Sir Lachlan Mor Maclean. Sir Lachlan Mor Maclean claimed that the island belonged to his clan and landed about 800 to 1,000 men at Loch Ghruinneart. MacDonald offered his uncle half of the island for MacLean's lifetime only, but he refused unless he received the entire island. James MacDonald had fewer troops but they were well trained. Allies to the Clan MacDonald sent men from Kintyre and Arran, including Clan MacAlister, which were led by Angus MhicMhuirich of Arran. MacDonald's forces feigned retreat toward the setting sun then turned around to fight with the sun in the eyes of their enemy. The MacDonalds were victorious and the MacLeans were defeated. A dwarf named Dubh Sith (Black Fairy) was hidden in a tree and he killed Sir Lachlan Mor Maclean with a shot through his eye after he had removed his helmet. With Sir Lachlan Mor Maclean and about 280 of his men killed in battle, the rest were chased to their boats and some sought refuge in the chapel of Kilnave. The chapel was burnt down, killing all but one of the men inside. Sir James MacDonald was seriously wounded after being shot through the body with an arrow. He was found after the battle amongst the dead MacDonalds, which also included Angus MhicMhuirich of Arran. About 30 MacDonalds were slain and 60 wounded. Afterwards James VI and I, the King of Scotland, awarded MacDonald lands to Clan Campbell, leading to an extension of the feud. Clan MacDonald's reign in Islay came to an end in 1612 when Angus MacDonald, 8th of Dunnyveg, the father of Sir James, sold his land holdings to Sir John Campbell of Cawdor of Clan Campbell of Cawdor.

The installation is no longer in use. The GK D√ºrnrohr had a nominal transmission rating of 550 MW. The nominal value of the DC voltage in the intermediate circuit was 145 kV. The transmission losses of the facility were 1.4%. History=Planning and construction= The planning of GK D√ºrnrohr was started in 1975, after a contract between Austria and Poland was agreed on concerning electric power exchange by a power line running over Czechoslovakia. Construction work at the facility started at the end of 1980. In the middle of 1983, the station started its service. After June 1983, the first experimental energy exchange with Czechoslovakia took place. =Decommissioning= After the synchronisation of electricity grids of West and Eastern Europe on 17 October 1995, the plant remained in operation until 31 October 1996, as Austria has no large 380 kV-grids, which is in contrast to Germany. However, afterwards in Poland, some power stations were equipped with an efficient frequency regulation device; the power grids of the Czech Republic and Austria could be done interconnected directly without using a HVDC-interconnection. The high voltage switchgears were used in Vienna Southeast Substation and in Southern Burgenland, like the transformers, which had to be modified for a secondary voltage of 110 kV. The obsolescence of the HVDC back-to-back station allowed an increase of the maximum power transmission rate between D√ºrnrohr and Slavƒõtice to 1386 MW. By exchanging some coils of the PLC-facility, the transmission capacity could be increased to 1481 MW. The installation of the second 380 kV circuit on the pylons of the D√ºrnrohr-Slavƒõtice powerline in 2008, for which they are already designed at time of construction, doubled this value to 2962 MVA. The originally planned selling of the facility to Eastern Europe for an HVDC-back-to-back station never took place; such a transaction would have served as an interconnection between the power grids of Eastern Europe and former Soviet Union. In 2007, the remaining parts of the facility were dismantled. The valve hall is used today by the former operator Verbund AG for operational uses. Rooms and equipment=Valve hall= The static inverter of the plant is situated in a reinforced concrete building that is 29.8 meters long, 15.4 meters large, and 13.8 meters high; at both long sides, there are two bays for the static inverter transformers. For protection against fire, the walls of the static inverter hall, which have a thickness of 20 centimetres, were equipped with stone wool insulation. The entire building is covered with a zinc-coated sheet, which serves as an electrical shielding and enclosure. The static inverter hall also has a cellar, in which the air conditioning system, the water cooling system, and the water treatment plant are installed. At the western end to the narrow side of the static inverter hall, there is the equipment building. In the equipment building, there are battery and electric rectifier rooms, storage and test equipment rooms, and the ventilation devices for the air conditioning system, along with an auxiliary control room. A window consisting of three glasses, which cannot be opened, allows a view from the equipment building to the valves of the static inverter. At the eastern end to the narrow side, there is a smoothing coil. =Transformer= On both sides of the static inverter, there are two three-phase transformers, each dimensioned for a power of 335 MVA with a nominal winding ratio of 400 to 63. =Static inverter= The static inverter, which is implemented as a twelve- pulse inverter, uses for each valve function a serial switch of 44 thyristors with a maximum blockade voltage of 4.2 kV and a maximum nominal DC current rating of 3790 A. The total number of thyristors used in the facility is 1056. The thyristors had a wafer diameter of 100 mm during construction and were, at the time, the largest thyristors of the world. Each static inverter consist of three thyristor towers, which are housed in the static inverter hall. Each thyristor tower contains a complete twelve-pulse branch of the static inverter. In these thyristor towers, for each valve function, four thyristor modules are used, which are arranged in two floors. Between the thyristor modules of a floor, there is a coil with an iron core. Parallel to the thyristor modules of a floor, there is a capacitor. Parallel to each valve function, there is a surge arrester in the form of a varistor. Each thyristor module consists of a connection of 11 thyristors, to which there are parallel connections from a capacitator and a resistor. The energy for the steering circuits of the thyristors is taken from the capacitor and resistor. As the thyristors and their steering electronics are on high voltage potential, the transmission of the ignition impulses from the control electronic on ground potential takes place via fibre optic cables. A second optical waveguide cable allows the transmission of data from the thyristor module to the main control electronics on ground potential. A programmable controller of the system SIMATIC S5 is used for controlling this system. The thyristors and the coils switched with them are cooled with deionised water, which circulates in a closed cycle. The developed heat is delivered to a second cycle, in which there is a mixture of glycol and water. Over evaporation radiators, the heat of this cycle is transferred to the environment. For maintenance purposes, dedicated modules are exchanged against intact modules and carried in the repair and inspection room. For this, a telescope-lifting platform and a crane are installed in the static inverter hall. =Smoothing coil= At the eastern side of the static inverter hall, there is a smoothing coil with an iron core of 85 mH. It was built by the company ELIN and is, as the high-voltage transformers, oil-cooled. =AC filters= As AC-filters, four resonance circuits are installed on both sides of the plant. Each of the filters consist of a series-connection of a two-microfarad capacitator with a coil to which a 615 ohm resistor is parallelized. One filter on each side uses a 41 mH air- core coil, while the other has a 29 mH air-core coil. On each power exit, there is also a bank of capacitors for reactive power compensation. The capacitors' values are two microfarads for the exit of the line toward Czech Republic and one microfarad for the exit toward Austria. =SVC-Compensator= The SVC-facility remained in service after the shut-down of the HVDC back-to- back station. It consists of two groups of single-phase coils with an inductivity of 86 mH, which are fed via a tertiary winding on the 380 kV/220 kV-transformers with a voltage of 30 kV and which can deliver a maximum reactive power of 200 MVar. The first coil group went into service in 1982, the second in 1986. =Power line to Czech Republic= The long powerline to Slavƒõtice substation in Czech Republic is a double-circuit 380 kV-line. However the second circuit was installed in 2008. In the Czech Republic, two- level conductor arrangement is used, while in Austria three-level conductor arrangement is used. The line crosses the border near Kleinhaugsdorf. When built, it was the first electrical power interconnection between the synchronous grid of Continental Europe and the Interconnected Power System of the Eastern bloc. In 1986 Robert Ospald succeeded the escape to Austria over the ground conductor of this line.Robert Ospald: 380.000 Volt Hoffnung auf Freiheit ReferencesExternal links *Siemens Energy Sector website (German) Converter stations Electric power infrastructure in Austria Energy infrastructure completed in 1983 2007 disestablishments in Austria ","title":"GK D√ºrnrohr"},{"id":"18593908","text":"WTTC-FM is a radio station located in Towanda, Pennsylvania.

Cricket career Martin was an English amateur cricketer who made 7 known appearances in first-class cricket matches from 1797 to 1813 as well as numerous appearances in other significant matches. His name is given as \\"Marten\\" in most if not all cricket sources. Martin was mainly associated with Surrey and was a member of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC).Arthur Haygarth, Scores & Biographies, Volume 1 (1744-1826), Lillywhite, 1862 Sir Henry died on 3 February 1842 at his house in Upper Harley Street, London. British West Indies Of a family long resident in Antigua and Montserrat his 271-page Travel journal of Sir H. W. Martin is in the manuscripts collection of the British Library and many pages are displayed online by the British Library, external link below. Auctioneer's description: Fine and extensive journal of Sir Henry Martin of Harley Street, London, chronicling his visit to the West Indies between 1836 and 1837, a detailed manuscript journal, closely written on 271 pages, with one pencil sketch showing a group of carts crossing a bridge, bound in marbled boards, 8vo A highly important account by a high status visitor to the West Indies at a very early date. Martin appears to be a very meticulous individual, with an eye for minute detail throughout his journey in every degree, making this an invaluable record not only of the West Indies, but also the general conditions in every place he visited, including the U.K. For example, he leaves Piccadilly in December 1836 via the Herald Coach to Falmouth noting, \\"Passage money inside ¬£4:5:0, outside ¬£2:5:0 - I had three enquiries made at the coach office on different days to ascertain the exact time that the coach got into Falmouth for the purpose of ordering dinner or not ...\\". He then notes in great detail the time taken to reach Falmouth. He leaves Piccadilly at 9.47am, reaching Bagshot at 53 minutes past noon, for example. He and his family (with servant) leave Falmouth on board the Mutine, the passage for all costing ¬£38. On board are a group of Cornish miners going to Cuba on a mining scheme. During the journey, he logs latitudes and longitudes for the entire passage, and details the day to day happenings on the vessel. The family reach the West Indies the following February and the journal is equally detailed about the topography and general social conditions which Martin observes. For example, he says of Martinique, \\"There are here many excellent shops, which would not disgrace Paris, and many private houses three storeys high and from four to six windows in line, chiefly I think built of stone ... we went to a hotel (as it's called) kept by a mulatto woman called Parker, a native of Barbados and well known to all naval persons who have been here of late years - I think she must be nearly 60 but she looks very much younger. She is quite a character and a very shrewd one too ...\\". This is an invaluable insight into the early 19th century, which deserves considerable research. Martin owned three sugar plantations in Antigua, and when the British government emancipated the slaves in the 1830s, he was associated with many others including slave owners, mortgagees and bankers in mostly unsuccessful claims for compensation for the liberation of over 300 slaves to the tune of about ¬£10,000.https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/927 ReferencesExternal sources * CricketArchive profile External links * Images of some of Martin's travel journal online 1768 births 1842 deaths English cricketers English cricketers of 1787 to 1825 Surrey cricketers Baronets in the Baronetage of Great Britain Surrey and Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Non- international England cricketers Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Cricket players from County Cork ","title":"Sir Henry Martin, 2nd Baronet"},{"id":"18593951","text":"Robert Ayling (dates unknown) was an English professional cricketer who made two known appearances in first-class cricket matches in 1796.Robert Ayling, CricketArchive.

In 1829 it appeared to the new Bishop of London, of his own knowledge, that the ecclesiastical duties of the vicarage and parish church of Watford were inadequately performed, by reason of the vicar's negligence. After three months without the instructed appointment being made by Capel the Bishop appointed a curate with a stipend. Capel refused to allow the curate to officiate and the stipend was not paid. \\"Capel resisted stoutly, and on one occasion the rector and the curate had a race for the reading-desk in church\\".CCF Greville, The Greville Memoirs, Vol II, 1885, page 113 In 1832 the dispute was brought to the Hertfordshire Assizes.

Cricket Capel was a keen sportsman, principally associated with fox- hunting and cricket. He played cricket as an amateur and made 1 known appearance in first-class cricket in 1808. His recorded career in significant matches ran from 1796 to 1809. Capel was a member of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and of Homerton Cricket Club.Arthur Haygarth, Scores & Biographies, Volume 1 (1744-1826), Lillywhite, 1862 He was a distant kinsman of the more famous cricketer Martin Bladen Hawke. Foxhunting Capel was an enthusiastic foxhunter as master of the Old Berkeley fox-hounds with kennels at Gerrards Cross. =Landmark foxhunting court case= Punch magazine The rights of property owners: The Earl of Essex v. The Hon. and Rev. W. Capel. In 1808 a public meeting of Noblemen Gentlemen and Farmers at Stanmore, chaired by the Earl of Essex, discussed the activities of the Berkeley hounds in the vicinity of the metropolis. In 1809 the Old Berkeley hunted a fox into the Essex estate and Capel with a follower jumped locked gates smashing the top rail of a fence. The Earl of Essex, his brother, George, thereupon sued him for trespass. The case was heard before Lord Ellenborough, Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench, at the Hertford Assizes 24 July 1809 and reported in The Times of 26 July 1809. The defendants, the members of the hunt, claimed the right of pursuit of their game over every man's enclosure . . . unless the law allowed them to do so, it would wholly destroy the manly exercise of the chase. Evidence was given that Holingshead, his Lordship's keeper, had been asked not to destroy foxes and told he would be sent a barrel of ale to drink success to the Berkeley Hunt. Lord Ellenborough decided the only question on the record was whether the defendants pursued the game with the sole view of extirpating noxious animals or with the desires of sportsmen. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff and it was agreed to take similar verdicts in other actions.

Developed as a means to encourage Australian nationalism and patriotic values, the organisation organises activities and the ideals of \\"Education through Travel\\", the aims of its founders. History Simons was secretary of the Western Australian Football League (WAFL) between 1905 and 1914, and believed that the encroachment of soccer, rugby and other \\"non-Australian\\" sports was threatening the game of Australian rules football. Along with several prominent Western Australians including Lionel Boas, the Young Australia Football League was formed in 1905 as a development organisation for football in Western Australia. The League organised intra- and interstate tours for young Western Australian football players to promote the Australian rules football code as part of a broader nationalist agenda. Other people involved with the establishment of the League were prominent Western Australian artists H. H. Eastcourt and Arthur Clarke, and noted Victorian artist Robert Prenzel. Shortly afterward, the YAFL changed its name to 'Young Australia League', and its activities were diversified to include literature, debating, band music, sport and theatrical performances, as well as outdoor pursuits such as hiking and camping. Setting its activities mainly for boys, the League promoted a philosophy of development of Australian nationalism with the aim of becoming the 'largest boys club in the British Empire'. In 1909 the League had its first of many interstate tours, with overseas tours conducted in 1911, 1914, 1924 and 1929. After World War I, branches were established in other states along similar lines to the Perth organisation. of land was purchased in 1929 in the Darling Scarp near Roleystone and developed for the League's outdoor activities. This became Araluen Botanical Gardens, as a memorial to YAL members killed in action, and was dedicated in 1930 by the Governor, Sir William Campion. Simons, who had extensive publishing interests, died in 1945. Four years prior, he assigned his interest in Western Press to YAL, giving the League a bequest of $50,000. The League continued but is now only operational in Western Australia. Due to declining funds, Araluen had fallen into disrepair by 1985 and was sold to the Government of Western Australia. Since 1990 it has been run as a not-for-profit volunteer organisation, responsible for the Park's restoration, preservation and development. In Simon's lifetime, an estimated 50,000 people participated in the well-known YAL travel tours around the world. Boas was president of the League for forty years, until his death in 1949. Facilities Camp Simons The League's headquarters are at 45 Murray Street, at the corner of Irwin Street, Perth; a heritage listed building which was built in 1924 to accommodate clubrooms and administration. The foyer houses an extensive museum of memorabilia associated with the League's early years. \\"Camp Simons\\" is a YAL‚Äìoperated youth camp set in bushland near Araluen, about 3 km from Canning Dam.

Kanburian pit viper, and tiger pit viper.Mehrtens JM. 1987. Living Snakes of the World in Color. New York: Sterling Publishers. 480 pp. . Highly venomous, it is an arboreal but heavily built species with a brown or tawny coloration. No subspecies are currently recognized. Description Adults grow to more than in length and are heavily built. The maximum length is unknown. Scalation includes 19 rows of dorsal scales at midbody, 159 ventral scales, 42 subcaudal scales and 10 supralabial scales, the third being the largest. The color pattern varies from brown with faint patterning to tawny with dull brown blotches and spots along with a ventrolateral stripe. This species, especially the population in the south, which was formerly referred to as T. venustus and recently shown to be a separate species, has often been confused with the mangrove pit viper, T. purpureomaculatus. However, the two are easily distinguished by the first three supralabial scales, which are much enlarged in T. kanburiensis. Geographic range Found in Thailand. The type locality given is \\"limestone hills near Kanburi, south- western Siam\\" (= Kanchanaburi, Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand). Listed as \\"S.W. China\\" in the catalogue entry at the British Museum of Natural History. Known only from two other areas near the type locality, as well as from the type locality given in Vogel (1991) for T. venustus, which is \\"Thung Song, Provinz Nakhon Si Thammarat, S√ºd-Thailand\\". Habitat The species is found in forest of nipples and open woodlnd. Behavior Arboreal and nocturnal, although they have been reported basking during daylight hours. Retreats to seek shelter in the foliage during the heat of the day. Feeding The diet consists of mammals and birds. Juveniles probably also feed on frogs and lizards. Reproduction Ovoviviparous, with females giving birth to live young. Taxonomy A review of this taxon by Warrell et al. (1992) found that the only difference between T. kanburiensis and T. venustus was in the number of midbody dorsal scale: 19 vs. 21 respectively. Based on this, they doubted that these were different species. However, David et al. (2004) have shown that they are indeed different species where kaburiensis is found in northern Thailand while venustus is found in the southern regions of Thailand and northern Malaysia.David P, Vogel G, Sumontha M, Pauwels OSG, Chanhome L. 2004.

Wolin. Part One, consisting of ten chapters and first published in 1960, distinguishes political philosophy from philosophy in general and traces political philosophy from its Platonic origins to modern day. Part Two, consisting of seven chapters and published (along with Part One) in a 2004 expanded edition, traces the development of political thought from Marx, Nietzsche, and others up to the late 20th century. Wolin left Part One unaltered in the expanded edition, confining the expressions of his changes in thought about political theory to those sections of Part Two that overlap with Part One. One sign of the significance of the work is the large number of graduate students and professors who for three decades used it as a primary source of guidance in the field of political theory. In revising the work, Wolin cites three major changes in political theory and politics between 1960 and 2004: (1) the aftermath of Fascism's fall in Europe and Communism's fall generally, with an intervening constant \\"semi-mobilization\\" by liberal democracies, (2) an increase in the rights of citizens against the tendencies of regimentation by the state (e.g. anti-discrimination laws), and (3) an increase in the ability of nations to \\"control, punish, survey, direct, and influence citizens.\\" Wolin states that the first change necessitated the latter two changes, leading to an \\"inverted totalitarianism\\" where increased rights exist alongside a less participatory citizenry under more pervasive governmental control. Wolin states that an inquiry is a process, a tool to find truths. Philosophy is distinguished from other forms of inquiry in that \\"philosophy claims to deal with truths publicly arrived at and publicly demonstrable.\\"Wolin, 2004, p. 4. Contrasted with this are revealed truths dealing with sacred rites, religion, and private findings of conscience or feelings. Political philosophy hews close to this characteristic of philosophy as a whole, with the public (\\"demos\\") at times in history demanding that laws be publicly demonstrated and accessible, even if their origin was supposedly revealed truth. For Wolin, it is the nature of politics that common concerns are brought before the political process, because the political is best equipped both to confront those concerns and to do so in a public, demonstrable, and thus philosophical manner. The discernment of what within philosophy exactly is political and what is not is confused by two factors: (1) the line can be blurred due to the interaction of political factors with other influences and (2) the language used to describe political ideas is often used in other contexts, and vocabulary from other areas is often applied to the political.

Envenomation is still a relatively major issue in certain parts of the world. One major area affected by envenomation is Asia. Through the study of the venom excreted by T. puniceus, we can potentially observe and find the effects of the venom based on the concentration and amount received.

During its initial stages, the Faculty of Arts and Science placed emphasis on courses related to pre-medicine: chemistry, biology, and physics. Students could also take classes in English, French, and history. In 1928, it offered a three-year program to grant a secondary-school teaching certificate. During the first two years, students in the program had to take classes required for graduation from the Faculty of Arts. These included Thai, Pali, English, French, history, Dhammavipak, and mathematics. Later, German was added to the program. In the third year, students had to fulfill requirements in pedagogy. In 1930, a three-year program in science was launched. Students were made to take courses in science during their first two years and complete the requirements in pedagogy in the third year before they were granted a certificate. The program was further developed to offer a bachelor's degree in 1934. The number of the first batch of graduates from the Faculty of Arts was 33. Subsequently, a master's degree program was established in 1942 and two students graduated with an MA in 1944. In 1950, the Faculty of Arts was entirely separated from the Faculty of Science and its administration was undertaken by its own staff. In 1961, the Faculty of Arts was restructured and separated into six divisions: Thai, Eastern languages, English, Western languages, geography and history, and library science. Two divisions, philosophy and dramatic arts, were established in 1971 and 1975 respectively. At present, the Faculty of Arts consists of eleven departments: Thai, English, history, geography, library science, philosophy, dramatic arts, Eastern languages, Western languages, linguistics, and comparative literature. Buildings= Mahachulalongkorn Building = Mahachulalongkorn Building The Mahachulalongkorn Building () or Tewalai (), a building in traditional architectural style, was designed by a German architect from the Ministry of Interior named Dr. Karl Dohring and an English architect from the Ministry of Education, Edward Healey. The two architects mixed ancient Thai styles from the Sukothai and Sawankaloke periods with Western motifs. It was built in 1914 to be an office of the university. On 3 January 1915, King Rama V went to the university for the opening of this building. On 26 March 26, 1916, the king changed the university's former name, Kharatchakarnponlaruan School (), to its new name, Chulalongkorn University (). The building was the first used for university offices. It was named Banchakarn () before it became Aksorasat 1 () and then Mahachulalongkorn. The building received the Association of Siamese Architects' Architectural Conservation Award in 1987. Arts students believe that students who take a photo with the Phaya Naga at the foot of the stairs of the building will not graduate. =Mahavajiravudh building= This building houses offices and the faculty library. =Borommaratchakumaree building= This building was named after Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn.

Since 1987 BABN has welcomed people who are just coming out or new to the area to have opportunities to meet and talk with other bisexuals and pansexuals. History Founded in 1987, BABN was the successor to the San Francisco Bisexual Center, which closed in 1984. Its founding was inspired by the 1987 East Coast Bisexual Network Conference, and it was founded by Lani Ka'ahumanu, Ann Justi and Maggi Rubenstein. For nearly 10 years, BABN coordinated a speaker's bureau, a newsletter, retreats, and monthly cultural and educational forums. BABN‚Äôs phone line offered one of very few ways for isolated bisexuals to find and connect with the bisexual community. Bi- Friendly was founded by BABN in 1988 as a way for bisexual and bi-friendly people to meet and socialize outside of bars and activist meetings. The group sponsored brunches, trips to the redwoods, movies, plays, baseball games etc. BABN is holding Bi-Friendly meetings as of 2012. In June 2019, BABN changed its name to Bay Area Bi+ & Pan Network (BABPN). They were the publisher of Anything That Moves magazine, during its run from 1990 to 2002.

Proposed Standards for Software (Def Stan 00-74) Def Stan 00-74 is defined in the context of Integrated Modular Avionics. Software components are located on modules. * Configuration and initialization: The configuration is considered as defined in a series of blueprints describing thread and process allocation, virtual communication channels... However, the standard does not define precisely the grammar or the language of these blueprints. As for initialization, there is no specific API to allow initialization by the low- level Real-time operating system (RTOS) services. * Access to Data is abstracted from its actual physical storage.

However, there are differences between the two standards: Some features of ASAAC API, such as file handling, thread managing inside process, or debugging, are not considered in ARINC 653. However, for the part where the two standards overlap, it is often possible to translate ASAAC interfaces in ARINC 653 API calls (and even in POSIX calls). Approximately 30% of the ASAAC API is covered directly by ARINC 653 and POSIX.

Quo was born in Hupei (Hubei) province in 1888 and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1911, Phi Beta Kappa. He was one of the technical delegates of China to the Paris Peace Conference, 1918‚Äì1919. At a time when the victors of the Great War were negotiating the spoils of war and punishment of the conquered, Quo controversially stated it would be better for the Germans to retain their concessions in Shantung (Shandong) than to allow the aggressive, militarist Japanese to take possession of them. The Chinese delegation's wishes were largely ignored by the European powers, and Quo's words proved prophetic as over the next three decades, Japan's appetite for conquest proved genocidal. Quo published a book in English, entitled China's Fight for Democracy, in 1920, at a time when the Kuomintang was actively struggling against several regional warlords to reunify China as a democratic republic. Quo Tai-chi held a variety of posts, including commissioner of foreign affairs of the \\"Canton government\\" in 1927 and Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China in the late 1920s and early 1930s. In 1929, he resigned the post of vice-minister of foreign affairs in protest of the placement of so many former imperial and warlord bureaucrats in the Kuomintang's Nanking (Nanjing) government, but was convinced to return. During one of his tenures as Vice-Minister, he was beaten by an angry, nationalist mob in Shanghai in May 1932 for his decision to sign an armistice with the Japanese, who were continuously pushing further into Chinese territory. He signed the armistice from the hospital, but resigned his post that year. From 1932 to 1940, Quo served as the first Chinese representative to Britain elevated from minister/legate to ambassador. He worked tirelessly to make China's case against Japan's continued, aggressive expansion in northern China at a time when the British were far more concerned with fascist acts of war on the Continent. He also lobbied for an end to British arms sales to the Japanese, whose airplanes, armed with British guns, were killing countless civilians in China even before war was declared. While ambassador to Court of St. James, Quo also signed treaties of amity between the Republic of China and the republics of Latvia and Estonia. In April 1941, Quo was named to replace Wang Ch'ung-hui as foreign minister by the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang. During his time as foreign minister, he negotiated an end to the special, extraterritorial rights exercised by the United States and United Kingdom in China since the mid-19th century. It was also he who, on December 8, 1941, confirmed that the Republic of China was officially at war with not only the Empire of Japan, but also Nazi Germany and the Kingdom of Italy. Quo represented China at the newly formed United Nations in San Francisco in 1946. He also presided over the first session of the U.N. Security Council held in March 1946 in New York. In November 1947, Y.P. Tsiang was named permanent Chief Chinese Delegate to the United Nations, replacing Quo. In December 1947, Quo was appointed Chinese ambassador to Brazil, replacing Cheng Tien-ku. He could remain the seat of China in the UN despite the communists' dominance in Mainland China and the establishment of the People's Republic of China.

She was the daughter of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, and the granddaughter of Strongbow and Aoife of Leinster. She held de Braose lands and castles in her own right following the public hanging of her husband by the orders of Llywelyn the Great, Prince of Wales. Family and marriage  Lady Eva was the 8th child of William Marshal. Eva and her sisters were described as being handsome, high-spirited girls.Costain, Thomas B.(1959). The Magnificent Century. Garden City, New York: Doubleday and Company Inc. p.103 From 1207 to 1212, Eva and her family lived in Ireland. Her paternal grandparents were John Marshal and Sibyl of Salisbury, and her maternal grandparents were Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, known to history as Strongbow and Aoife of Leinster, for whom she was probably named. Sometime before 1221, she married Marcher lord William de Braose, who in June 1228 succeeded to the lordship of Abergavenny, and by whom she had four daughters. William was the son of Reginald de Braose and his first wife Grecia Briwere. He was much hated by the Welsh who called him Gwilym Ddu or Black William. Pembroke Castle, Wales, the birthplace of Eva Marshal =Issue= * Isabella de Braose (b.1222), married Prince Dafydd ap Llywelyn. She died childless. * Maud de Braose (1224‚Äì1301), in 1247, she married Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Wigmore, by whom she had issue, including Edmund Mortimer, 2nd Baron Mortimer and Isabella Mortimer, Countess of Arundel. * Eva de Braose (1227 ‚Äì 28 July 1255), married William de Cantelou, by whom she had issue. * Eleanor de Braose (c.1228 ‚Äì 1251). On an unknown date after August 1241, she married Humphrey de Bohun. They had two sons, Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford and Gilbert de Bohun, and one daughter, Alianore de Bohun. All three children married and had issue. Eleanor was buried in Llanthony Secunda Priory.  Widowhood  Eva's husband was publicly hanged by Llywelyn the Great, Prince of Wales on 2 May 1230 after being discovered in the Prince's bedchamber together with his wife Joan, Lady of Wales. Several months later, Eva's eldest daughter Isabella married the Prince's son, Dafydd ap Llywelyn, as their marriage contract had been signed prior to William de Braose's death. Prince Llywelyn wrote to Eva shortly after the execution, offering his apologies, explaining that he had been forced to order the hanging due to the insistence by the Welsh lords. He concluded his letter by adding that he hoped the execution would not affect their business dealings.\\"Royal and Other Historical Letters illustrative of the Reign of Henry III\\" , ed The Rev. W.W. Shirley, M.A. ‚Äì The Rolls Series 1862; letter 763a in Latin, translated at http://douglyn.co.uk/BraoseWeb/family/translation.html Following her husband's execution, Eva held de Braose lands and castles in her own right. She is listed as holder of Totnes in 1230, which she held until her death. It is recorded on the Close Rolls (1234‚Äì1237) that Eva was granted 12 marks by King Henry III of England to strengthen Hay Castle. She had gained custody of Hay as part of her dower.Close Rolls (1234‚Äì1237) In early 1234, Eva was caught up in her brother Richard's rebellion against King Henry and possibly acted as one of the arbitrators between the King and her mutinous brothers following Richard's murder in Ireland.Linda Elizabeth Mitchell (2003). Portraits of Medieval Women: Family, Marriage and Politics in England 1225‚Äì1350. New York: Palgrave MacMillan. p.47 This is evidenced by the safe conduct she received in May 1234, thus enabling her to speak with the King. By the end of that month, she had a writ from King Henry granting her seisen of castles and lands he had confiscated from her following her brother's revolt. Eva also received a formal statement from the King declaring that she was back in \\"his good graces again\\".Mitchell, p.47 She died in 1246 at the age of forty-three.

Different criteria or thresholds of severity have sometimes been used. National and international figures are typically estimated by large-scale surveys of self-reported symptoms up to the time of assessment; sometimes a figure is calculated for the occurrence of disorder in the week, month or year prior to assessment‚Äìa point or period prevalence; sometimes the figure is for a person's lifetime prior to assessment‚Äìthe so-called lifetime prevalence.  Population studies  Numerous large-scale surveys of the prevalence of mental disorders in adults in the general population have been carried out since the 1980s based on self-reported symptoms assessed by standardized structured interviews, usually carried out over the phone. Mental disorders have been found to be common, with over a third of people in most countries reporting sufficient criteria to be diagnosed at some point in their life. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported in 2001 that about 450 million people worldwide suffer from some form of mental disorder or brain condition, and that one in four people meet criteria at some point in their life. = World Health Organization global study = The World Health Organization is currently undertaking a global survey of 26 countries in all regions of the world, based on ICD and DSM criteria.The World Mental Health Survey Initiative The first published figures on the 14 country surveys completed to date, indicate that, of those disorders assessed, anxiety disorders are the most common in all but 1 country (prevalence in the prior 12-month period of 2.4% to 18.2%) and mood disorders next most common in all but 2 countries (12-month prevalence of 0.8% to 9.6%), while substance disorders (0.1‚Äì6.4%) and impulse- control disorders (0.0‚Äì6.8%) were consistently less prevalent. The United States, Colombia, the Netherlands and Ukraine tended to have higher prevalence estimates across most classes of disorder, while Nigeria, Shanghai and Italy were consistently low, and prevalence was lower in Asian countries in general. Cases of disorder were rated as mild (prevalence of 1.8‚Äì9.7%), moderate (prevalence of 0.5‚Äì9.4%) and serious (prevalence of 0.4‚Äì7.7%). The World Health Organization has published worldwide incidence and prevalence estimates of individual disorders. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is two to three times as common in Latin America, Africa, and Europe as in Asia and Oceania. Schizophrenia appears to be most common in Japan, Oceania, and Southeastern Europe and least common in Africa. Bipolar disorder and panic disorder have very similar rates around the world. However, these are widely believed to be underestimates, due to poor diagnosis (especially in countries without affordable access to mental health services) and low reporting rates, in part because of the predominant use of self-report data, rather than semi- structured instruments such as the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID); actual lifetime prevalence rates for mental disorders are estimated to be between 65% and 85%. = US mental health studies = Previous widely cited large-scale surveys in the US were the Epidemiological Catchment Area (ECA) survey and subsequent National Comorbidity Survey (NCS). The NCS was replicated and updated between 2000 and 2003 and indicated that, of those groups of disorders assessed, nearly half of Americans (46.4%) reported meeting criteria at some point in their life for either a DSM-IV anxiety disorder (28.8%), mood disorder (20.8%), impulse-control disorder (24.8%) or substance use disorders (14.6%). Half of all lifetime cases had started by age 14 and three quarters by age 24. In the prior 12-month period only, around a quarter (26.2%) met criteria for any disorder‚Äîanxiety disorders 18.1%; mood disorders 9.5%; impulse control disorders 8.9%; and substance use disorders 3.8%. A substantial minority (23%) met criteria for more than two disorders. 22.3% of cases were classed as serious, 37.3% as moderate and 40.4% as mild.US National Institute of Mental Health (2006) The Numbers Count: Mental Disorders in America Retrieved May 2007 = European population studies = A 2004 cross-European study found that approximately one in four people reported meeting criteria at some point in their life for one of the DSM-IV disorders assessed, which included mood disorders (13.9%), anxiety disorders (13.6%) or alcohol disorder (5.2%). Approximately one in ten met criteria within a 12-month period. Women and younger people of either gender showed more cases of disorder. A 2005 review of 27 studies have found that 27% of adult Europeans is or has been affected by at least one mental disorder in the past 12 months. It was also found that the most frequent disorders were anxiety disorders, depressive, somatoform and substance dependence disorders.  Specific mental disorders = Anxiety disorders = A review that pooled surveys in different countries up to 2004 found overall average prevalence estimates for any anxiety disorder of 10.6% (in the 12 months prior to assessment) and 16.6% (in lifetime prior to assessment), but that rates for individual disorders varied widely. Women had generally higher prevalence rates than men, but the magnitude of the difference varied. = Mood disorders = A review that pooled surveys of mood disorders in different countries up to 2000 found 12-month prevalence rates of 4.1% for major depressive disorder (MDD), 2% for dysthymic disorder and 0.72% for bipolar 1 disorder. The average lifetime prevalence found was 6.7% for MDD (with a relatively low lifetime prevalence rate in higher-quality studies, compared to the rates typically highlighted of 5‚Äì12% for men and 10‚Äì25% for women), and rates of 3.6% for dysthymia and 0.8% for Bipolar 1. Certain population subgroups, such as physicians in training, have 12-month prevalence rates as high as 21 to 43%. = Schizophrenia = A 2005 review of prior surveys in 46 countries on the prevalence of schizophrenic disorders, including a prior 10-country WHO survey, found an average (median) figure of 0.4% for lifetime prevalence up to the point of assessment and 0.3% in the 12-month period prior to assessment. A related figure not given in other studies (known as lifetime morbid risk), reported to be an accurate statement of how many people would theoretically develop schizophrenia at any point in life regardless of time of assessment, was found to be \\"about seven to eight individuals per 1,000\\" (0.7/0.8%). The prevalence of schizophrenia was consistently lower in poorer countries than in richer countries (though not the incidence), but the prevalence did not differ between urban/rural areas or men/women (although incidence did). = Personality disorders = Studies of the prevalence of personality disorders (PDs) have been fewer and smaller-scale, but a broader Norwegian survey found a similar overall prevalence of almost 1 in 7 (13.4%), based on meeting personality criteria over the prior five-year period. Rates for specific disorders ranged from 0.8% to 2.8%, with rates differing across countries, and by gender, educational level and other factors. A US survey that incidentally screened for personality disorder found an overall rate of 14.79%. = Child psychiatric disorders = Approximately 7% of a preschool pediatric sample were given a psychiatric diagnosis in one clinical study, and approximately 10% of 1- and 2-year-olds receiving developmental screening have been assessed as having significant emotional/behavioral problems based on parent and pediatrician reports.

Retrieved 12 Oct. 2020 (2 March 1871 ‚Äì 3 March 1959) was a Welsh international fullback, who played club rugby for Swansea, and a county cricketer for Glamorgan, for whom he was the first professional player in 1895. Bancroft was seen as one of the first true stars of Welsh rugby and played rugby with extreme self-confidence.Thomas (1979), p. 15. He possessed great speed and was an excellent kicker of the ball,Smith (1980), p. 82. though some critics felt his defensive play was weak. His brother Jack also played rugby for Wales. Club career in rugby Bancroft made his first club appearance for Swansea on 5 October 1889. He would play for Swansea for his entire career and is considered one of the greatest fullbacks to have played for the club. He was Swansea's top points scorer in twelve of his fourteen years with the team. International rugby career Bancroft was first capped on 1 February 1890 against Scotland as a replacement for the injured Tommy England.Smith (1980), p. 64. Bancroft would play 33 times for his country, all consecutively, a record that would lay unbroken until Ken Jones did so in 1954. Although Bancroft would only win two out of his first nine Welsh games, he was part of the Wales team that won their first Triple Crown in 1893. The first game of that season saw Wales face England at the Cardiff Arms Park. With little time left to play and Wales losing 9‚Äì11, they were awarded a penalty near touch, 30 yards from the England goal line. The Welsh captain, Arthur Gould called Bancroft over and told him to kick (from the ground) for goal. Bancroft insisted on dropping for goal, but Gould forbade it. The two began arguing in front of the home crowd, until in frustration Gould threw the ball to the ground and walked away. Bancroft successfully kicked the drop goal which would win the match for Wales.Thomas (1979), pp. 15‚Äì16. This penalty goal although dropped by Bancroft was still awarded as such, and was rugby's first ever penalty goal. In 1899 in a match against Ireland at Stradey Park, Bancroft would fail to complete an international match for the only time in his career. Due to no barriers around the pitch the crowd were lined up around the touch line. The referee was forced to delay the match for half an hour while police and officials attempted to force the crowd back. During the second half Bancroft attempted another one of his testing runs to tire out the opposition but was caught by, Mick and Jack, Ireland's Ryan brothers,Smith (1980), p. 115. who tackled Bancroft and dumped him over the touchline and into the crowd. Bancroft landed awkwardly and fractured several ribs, forcing him to retire from the game.Griffiths, John; Rugby's Strangest Matches, Robson Books (1988), pp. 37‚Äì39 After the Gould Affair, Bancroft was given the captaincy in 1898, and led Wales to their second Triple Crown in 1900. =International matches played= WalesSmith (1980), p. 463. * 1890, 1891, 1892, 1893, 1894, 1895, 1896, 1897, 1898, 1899, 1900, 1901 * 1890, 1891, 1892, 1893, 1894, 1895, 1896, 1898, 1899, 1900, 1901 * 1890, 1891, 1892, 1893, 1894, 1895, 1896, 1899, 1900, 1901 Cricket career Bancroft first played cricket for Glamorgan at the age of 18 in a friendly match against Warwickshire at the Cardiff Arms Park in 1889. He quickly became a regular player and when Glamorgan decided to appoint their first professional cricketer, around the mid 1890s, they selected Bancroft. A fine all-round player at minor county level, Bancroft would not only bat and bowl, but would sometimes stand in as wicket keeper. He represented Glamorgan against South Africa in their 1894 tour of Great Britain. His batting record at Glamorgan ended with a total of 8,250 runs with his best innings of 207 scored in 1903 against Berkshire. Bancroft kept his ties with Glamorgan after retiring as a player, and coached many youngsters who came through the club, including future Test cricketer Gilbert Parkhouse. St. Helen's ground Bancroft had very close ties to St. Helen's Rugby and Cricket Ground, having lived there as a child where his father, and his father before him, were groundsman. He played club rugby at the ground with Swansea and cricket there with Glamorgan. In his later years he too would become St Helen's groundsman.The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales.

In it, three friends decide to drop everything and run a surf shop in Oahu, Hawaii. When they arrive, they find out that it's not as easy as they thought. The show was produced by Levine & Isaacs Productions in association with Paramount Television. Pilot synopsis The pilot episode opens with three friends, Marshall Fisher (Adam Arkin), Richie Lamonica (Patrick Breen), and Dave Bell (David Morse), sitting in a bar, talking. Apparently, Marshall has just lost his job, and Dave is divorcing his wife. Dave comes up with the idea of starting a surf shop in Oahu, Hawaii called Big Wave Dave's, and the whole club starts dreaming about it. Dave suggests that they should really do it; his friends are a bit doubtful, but they eventually decide to go along with it. But then they think about Marshall's wife, and they have to convince her. That same night, the three guys go over to Marshall's house to convince his wife, Karen (Jane Kaczmarek). Out of the blue, Karen decides to go along with them. All of them, very excited, arrive in Hawaii a few weeks later. Karen tries to help Dave and Marshall with decorating the store, but they want to do that on their own. After looking around the store a bit, Dave decides to go surfing. A few seconds later, Richie comes into the store saying that he found himself in Hawaii. Meanwhile, a man with a barrow carrying Dave comes in, saying that he blames the Beach Boys for all the surfers at the beach. Dave had had a surfing accident but seems to be all right. The man introduces himself as Jack Lord and says that he hates newcomers on the beach and that he had named himself after his idol, Jack Lord. When he leaves the shop, it starts raining. Two hours later, when it's still raining, Marshall decides to leave, but nobody wants to go with him. Dave doesn't want to go because this was his idea, and Richie still believes he's a different person in Hawaii. When a woman walks in, Richie wants to prove that he's different here; after saying hello to her, however, he decides to go back to Chicago. Just when the guys are about to leave, Karen walks in and gives them a speech that pulls them back in. When Marshall still isn't happy, Karen reveals that she became pregnant the night they decided to go to Hawaii.  Characters  * Marshall Fisher (Adam Arkin), a former lawyer, who's the leader of the group. At first he needed some time adjusting to Hawaii, because he couldn't leave his old life behind, but later he fitted in just right. * Richie Lamonica (Patrick Breen), a former high-school typing teacher who claims he found a new life in Hawaii, but eventually back's out. In the pilot episode he states that he never had any other friends that Dave and Marshall. Richie has a one-room apartment. * Dave Bell (David Morse), the person who thought of starting Big Wave Dave's which is named after him. Before he and his friends went to Hawaii he was Marshall's stockbroker. He also explained that the only day in his life that when he was ever happy was when he was surfing. * Karin Fisher (Jane Kaczmarek), Marshall's wife, a lawyer like her husband used to be. According to Marshall, she knows everything. In the store she's in charge of the inventory, promotion, accounting, hiring, firing and any long range direction. * Jack Lord (Kurtwood Smith), an elderly man that lives close to Big Wave Dave's. He's a big fan of the real Jack Lord and he worked as an extra on Hawaii Five-O, and, as he describes it, that's when the Lord came into his life. He also changed his name because he was being \\"chased\\" by the Diner's Club. He usually dreams that he's much bigger than he is in real life and he has lived on the beach for 20 years.

She was in the Snow Shipyards, Rockland, Maine, from 12 October to 6 December 1944. When she was ready for sea again, Stagbush sailed for Hawaii via the Panama Canal; San Diego, California; and Tiburon, Mexico, where she took on a load of nets. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 12 February 1945 and sailed the next day via Eniwetok; Ulithi; and Leyte, Philippine Islands, for the Ryukyu Islands.

The ship sailed for Wakayama, Japan, on 8 September, to assist in clearing mines. A few days later, she laid swept channel buoys in Kii Suido after minesweepers had cleared the entrance. She then returned to Okinawa for acoustic minesweeping gear to be transported to Japan. Andy (Bones) Gravino proudly served. End-of-war activity Stagbush remained at Sasebo for a few days and then moved to Fukuoka in late October to act as tender for auxiliary motor minesweepers. This duty was completed on 2 December 1945 and the net layer got underway for San Francisco, California. Post-war decommissioning Stagbush was decommissioned at Mare Island, California, on 26 March 1946 and struck from the Navy List on 21 May. She was sold to Robert A. Martinolich in April 1947 and converted for merchant service. She burned at Norfolk, Virginia, on 16 October 1954. Honors and awards Stagbush received one battle star for World War II service.

It is one of three airports in the province of Leyte, the others being Daniel Z. Romualdez Airport in Tacloban and Hilongos Airport. Likewise, Ormoc Airport is one of the few airports in the Philippines to be situated in an \\"airport village\\", a barangay specifically designated for the airport and its surrounding area. The airport is classified as a Class 2 principal (minor domestic) airport by the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines, a body of the Department of Transportation and Communications that is responsible for the operations of not only this airport but also of all other airports in the Philippines except the major international airports. The airport code OMC was assigned to Ormoc Airport by the United States Department of Transportation during the colonial period. Since airport codes can be reused, DOT also assigned the airport the ID #14558, which identifies a unique airport, and the sequence ID #1455802 which identifies a unique airport at a given point in time. History and expansion Ormoc Airport had been previously served by several airlines. The airport had suffered damage following several natural calamities, including Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) in 2013 and the magnitude 6.5 earthquake in July 2017. In February 2018, the P34-million rehabilitation project begun carried out by DOTr and the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) was completed last May 31. It includes the expansion of the airport's total area from 150 square meters to 1,350 sqm, the renovation of the passenger terminal building, and the construction of the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) administration building. The airport's runway is being improved to accommodate larger aircraft.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, huge fortunes were made prior to US income taxation. Opulence in homes and yachting reached a peak; many small private steamships like Cangarda were produced in the US, Britain and Germany for the very wealthy. However, Cangarda is the only surviving US-built Edwardian steam yacht and one of only three of her type remaining worldwide. After years of service in roles from opulence to indignity, the yacht sank in Boston Harbor in 1999 in poor repair, but has since been restored at Richmond, California for use as a private yacht and periodic museum ship. History Cangarda was named as a combination of the last names of the original owners, Michigan lumber mogul Charles Canfield and his wife Belle Gardner. In 1904, George Taylor Fulford, a wealthy member of the Canadian Parliament, bought the boat and renamed her Magedoma, which was a combination of syllables from the names of his wife and children (MAry, GEorge, DOrothy, MArtha.) The boat was docked at Fulford Place, his mansion nestled on the banks of the St. Lawrence River in Brockville, Ontario, Canada. After Fulford's death in 1905, the yacht remained in the family and in 1927 his wife hosted the Prince of Wales, The Prince George (future Duke of Kent), and the Prime Ministers of both England and Canada, Stanley Baldwin and William Lyon Mackenzie King respectively, on board. During World War II, Cangarda (or Magedoma, as it was then known) was donated by the family to the Royal Canadian Navy, to be used as a training vessel. After the war the ship was returned to the Fulford family, but in poor condition. The ship was sold to Frederic Burtis Smith who lived aboard for many years at Rochester, NY, His efforts to preserve the old yacht and carry her into a time when interest in old things was growing can be credited with saving the vessel. But she slowly went into disrepair. In the early 1980s an attempt was made to restore her. The ship was disassembled in Boston and an effort was made to rebuild the hull, but the project failed and in 1999 the gutted hull sank in Boston Harbor. These efforts preserved the interior and machinery for later use. Present day Steam yacht CANGARDA at Belfast, ME. July, 2017 (inset: Cangarda name on stack)In 2004, after years of efforts by historians and yachtsman, Jeff Rutherford of Richmond, California began a full restoration, funded by Marin, California resident Bob McNeil. The Cangarda‚Äôs original hull and keel required rebuilding, so it was meticulously measured including laser scanning. New hull sections were reverse-engineered, using modern welding techniques, with the help of Geoff Molnar, rather than the original rivet style of fastening. The original steam machinery (Sullivan triple expansion main engine, 5 auxiliary pumps and the anchor windless) were reconditioned and reinstalled with all new service piping by Steve Cobb and Pete Jordan. The existing 1911 Almy (coal fired) boiler was replaced with a modern, code, automated, forced draft, oil fired boiler. Both masts are new as are the decks. In addition, much of the elegant Victorian interior was reinstalled, using the original Cuban mahogany woodwork. The new, reconstructed Cangarda was completed in 2009. Cangarda made a historic trip back to Brockville, Ontario From June 4‚Äì5, 2011 tours of the yacht were available during this time to members of the public with all proceeds going to The Friends of Fulford Place ‚Äì a volunteer group that raises funds for the restoration of Fulford Place National Historic Site. On June 14-16 2003 Cangarda returned to Brockville to take part in the Tall Ships 1812 Tour First Port of Call.

At in surface area it is the largest lake entirely within Orange County, after which it is named.Greenwood Lake is far larger at , but it is shared with Passaic County, New Jersey. Geography The lake, long by wide, sits in a glacial trough, with extensive swamps abutting its north and south ends and gentle rises on the east and west. NY 52 follows the lake's southern shore through these swamps, and NY 300 passes the northern end of the swamps in that direction. Lakeside Road runs along the heavily- developed eastern side of the lake, while Rock Cut Road parallels the western shore and gives access to the less-developed neighborhoods there. It is fed from the north by Bushfield Creek, which rises to the north in the Town of Shawangunk in Ulster County. The creek then drains to the east, closely following Route 52, until it empties into Quassaick Creek near Algonquin Park. Via the Quassaick, the lake's waters eventually reach the Hudson River at the boundary between the city of Newburgh and New Windsor. On clear enough days, it is possible to see the Devil's Path range in the Greene County section of the Catskills from the lake's southern end. This is one of the farthest locations to the south from which these peaks can be seen without climbing a mountain. History The Native Americans called the lake \\"Oussuk\\", meaning \\"stony pond.\\" The Dutch settlers called it \\"Binnin\\", meaning \\"water within land\\" or \\"water between other waters\\". In 1684, Governor Thomas Dongan purchased the lake and surrounding territory from the Native Americans and divided this patent into numerous farms, most especially dairy farms. At the time of the Revolutionary War, a man named Capt. Thomas Machin owned and operated a saw mill, grist mill, and finally a mint in what is now the hamlet, at the very beginning of the outlet stream. An historical marker marks the site of Machin's Mill on Lakeside Road. At that time, the lake began to be called Machin's Pond. In the 1830s, a local clergyman named James B. Wilson began calling the lake Orange Lake. The reasons for this name change remain obscure, but are probably related to its location in Orange County. Local legend states that many residents objected to this name change, but it did stick and remains the name of the lake and the hamlet to this day. Because the lake is above sea level, its outlet stream became a very popular site for mills. The largest was the Newburgh Bleachery, owned and operated by the Chadwick Family. During the 19th century, the shores of the lake became a popular location for summer cottages. Transportation to the lake and the hamlet was difficult until 1895, when trolley service was established between the City of Newburgh and the Village of Walden, and Orange Lake, approximately the half way point, became a popular stop. Soon after this Newburgh and Walden Electric Railway initiated service, a highly successful amusement park opened on the south shore of the lake. The trolley line went out of business in 1926. The amusement park went out of business during the Great Depression and was demolished in 1941. Pine Point was a highly successful resort on a peninsula off the southern shore of the lake. During the big band era, many nationally known recording acts appeared at the resort, including Frank Sinatra and Benny Goodman. It opened for business in 1896, and was closed and demolished in 1953. Lakeview House on Lakeside Road originally opened in 1866 as a boarding house, and did business as O'Malley's Bar for many years. Today, it continues to do business as a restaurant under its original name. Use The lake is not part of any local water supply system, and there is no public access for recreational purposes. Residents of the Orange Lake community who live on the eastern shore, or in the \\"Orange Lake Estates\\" neighborhood off of Rock Cut Rd. on the western shore have deeded access to the lake whether their property is on it or not; they use it for boating, fishing and swimming in summer and ice fishing during colder periods in winter when it freezes over.

Rhead's father, G.W. Rhead, worked in the pottery industry, and young Frederick was apprenticed at Mintons Ltd. He was one of a number of apprentices who in the 1870s learnt the art of p√¢te-sur-p√¢te decoration from Marc-Louis Solon, a French √©migr√© who was the leading exponent of this ceramic technique. Rhead continued to work in p√¢te-sur-p√¢te after leaving Minton. He joined Wedgwood and went on to work at a number of potteries including a failed venture of his own. His most famous piece of ceramics is the \\"Gladstone Vase\\" which was presented to William Ewart Gladstone by the Liberals of Burslem in 1888. The vase is on public view, having been loaned to the Gladstone Pottery Museum in Longton, Staffordshire. Besides working in three dimensions as a ceramic designer, Rhead worked in two dimensions as a graphic designer, although in the latter field he was somewhat overshadowed by his brother Louis Rhead who pursued a successful career in the USA.

In 2013, a number of staff lost their jobs at the school following evidence that BTEC science coursework (GCSE-level) for 69 pupils had been written by Year 12 students.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/flagship- academy-teacher-cheated-harris-federation-pupils-science-coursework-rewritten- to-improve-grades-8940442.html In 2019 numerous Harris Academies were accused of 'gaming' the system through the practice of entering entire cohorts for the ESOL qualification, which is aimed at students who have English as an additional language (EAL), Harris Falconwood entered the whole of their Year 11 cohort (177 students) despite only having 15 EAL students. This was shown to be common practice across the Federation. https://schoolsweek.co.uk/harris- schools-swamp-esol-exam-with-native-english-speakers/. Former pupils at Westwood Secondary School include dance instructor and television presenter Len Goodman, who lived at Blackfen and who was a member of the school cricket team.

Mr Tom Street, a long-serving employee of the Harris Federation, will take up post as Head of Harris Academy Falconwood.https://0e58658be539ee7325a0-220f04f871df648cf4a4d93a111e3366.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/harris_secondary_falconwood/uploads/lettershome/T-Askew- Retirement-Announcement-New-Head-of-Academy.pdf ReferencesExternal links *Welling Website Academies in the London Borough of Bexley Educational institutions established in 2008 2008 in London 2008 establishments in England Secondary schools in the London Borough of Bexley Falconwood ","title":"Harris Academy Falconwood"},{"id":"18594461","text":"Michel Nielsen Grendahl (12 March 1775 - 18 January 1849) was a Norwegian farmer, shipbuilder and politician. Grendahl was born at Rennebu in Sor- Trondelag, Norway. His parents were Niels Mikkelsen Grindal (1739-1811) and Randi Mikkelsdatter Stavne (1745-1814). He grew up on the family farm (√òvre Grindal i Rennebu) in the parish of Rennebu. He traveled to Bergen where he first became interested in shipping. In 1806, he traveled to Kristiansund where he engaged in shipbuilding. His business did well but he was determined to return to farming. In 1821, he bought Havstein (Havstein G√•rd p√• By√•sen), large farm in the Trondheim district of By√•sen. Influenced by the reform teachings of Hans Nielsen Hauge, his farm became a spiritual center for the Haugean Movement (haugianere). Grendahl was elected to the Norwegian Parliament in 1830, 1833, 1836 and 1842, representing the rural constituency of S√∏ndre Trondhjems Amt (today S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag).

He played all or part of six seasons in the major leagues between and . He played for the Boston Braves, Chicago Cubs, Pittsburgh Pirates, Indianapolis Hoosiers, and Newark Peppers. In 546 games, Campbell batted .310 (642-2069) with 326 runs scored, 15 home runs, 171 RBI, 92 stolen bases, an on-base percentage of .357 and a slugging percentage of .408. Early life Campbell, whose father was a St. Louis physician, attended Smith Academy and Vanderbilt University, where he played both football and baseball. As a member of Dan McGugin's Vanderbilt Commodores football team, Campbell was a halfback, and he was selected for John Heisman's College Football All-Southern Team in 1907. Baseball career As an educated man from a wealthy family, Campbell was rare among baseball players of his era, and he was frequently torn between his baseball career and opportunities in the business world. He joined the Chicago Cubs in 1908, but he played only one game that year, and the sportswriters in that city made fun of him for wearing fancy clothes. He made it back to the major leagues with the 1910 Pittsburgh Pirates, hitting .326 in 97 games. He could not agree on contract terms with Pittsburgh for the next season, and he secured a job with a brokerage firm. He returned to the Pirates in July 1911. In his most complete season, Campbell played in 145 games with the 1912 Boston Braves, leading the league in at bats (624), hitting .296 and stealing 19 bases. He led the league's center fielders with 144 games at that position. Campbell left baseball again after that season, becoming the St. Louis sales agent for an auto parts company. He married Katherine Munhall, who came from a well-to-do family in Pittsburgh. He entered the Federal League with the 1914 Indianapolis Hoosiers. He remained with the team in 1915, when they were known as the Newark Peppers. Campbell had a contract for the next year, but the Federal League shut down. Campbell sued league executives for his lost pay and was awarded nearly $6,000. Campbell hit for a good batting average and had good speed, but his defensive ability was limited. In an era in which gloves were much smaller, Campbell's small hands created a disadvantage in the field. Later life Campbell left baseball after the 1915 season. He died in 1969 in Towson, Maryland.

EUREF deals with the definition, realization and maintenance of the European Geodetic Reference Frame. The goal of EUREF is to establish a unified geodetic datum (ETRS89) and a consistent network of reference stations (EPN) throughout Europe. EUREF was founded in 1987 at the IUGG General Assembly held in Vancouver. Mission EUREF is driven by a voluntary agreement of scientific organisations and national geodetic/geographic agencies of the member countries, who are willing to replace their legacy national geodetic datums with a unified European Reference Frame and join their national networks of reference stations into a common European network. The mandate of EUREF is to foster and coordinate the activities of the member countries, which are financed and managed on the national level. EUREF realizes and maintains ETRS89, the European geodetic datum, which is to become a single datum used for geodetic applications in all the member countries. A key instrument in maintaining ETRS89 is the EUREF Permanent Network (EPN), a network of reference stations which covers the European continent. EUREF is also working on the European Vertical Reference System (EVRS), which goal is to determine a unified dm-level accurate geoid model and gravity-referenced height system throughout Europe. EUREF coordinates its activities with EuroGeographics. Structure The activities of EUREF are discussed and decisions are taken at the annual symposium. The last symposia have been attended by more than 120 participants coming from about 30 member countries of Europe. The results of EUREF are available in the symposia proceedings, which contain the presented scientific papers as well as national reports, resolutions and documentation. Current activities are led by the Governing Board (GB), formerly Technical Working Group (TWG), which is elected at the symposia and is meeting three times a year to manage current activities. The minutes of the GB meetings are published online together with the symposia proceedings. European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 (ETRS89) ETRS89 is a Cartesian ECEF geodetic datum, in which Eurasian Plate as a whole is static. Within Europe, coordinates and maps based on ETRS89 are stable because temporal variations due to the continental drift are minimized. ETRS89 coincided with the global ITRS datum in 1989, hence the name. ETRS89 and ITRS diverge due to the continental drift at a speed about 2.5 cm per year. European Vertical Reference System (EVRS) EVRS is a zero-tidal gravity- related height reference system. It is realized by the geopotential numbers and normal heights of the United European Leveling Network (UELN). EVRS heights are computed in certain intervals from the latest measurements of the UELN participating countries. So far, three realizations of EVRS have been published: EVRF2000, EVRF2007 and EVRF2019.\\"EVRS\\" Web page Bundesamt f√ºr Kartographie und Geod√§sie.
