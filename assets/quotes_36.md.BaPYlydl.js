Background  Reedie was born in Stirling, in Scotland, in 1941. He was educated at High School of Stirling and the University of Glasgow. He gained his Master of Arts (MA) in 1962 and then studied for a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree in 1964, still at the University of Glasgow. In his professional career, Reedie was a partner in a Scottish independent financial advisory company. He is married and has two children. He still has a home in his native Scotland.  Sports administration  In his sporting life, Reedie gained success playing badminton from 1962 to 1970, culminating in becoming a doubles champion. At the time, badminton was not recognised as an Olympic sport, a situation his influence was able to remedy in 1985, leading to the first medals being awarded at the 1992 Summer Olympics. After his success as a player, Reedie turned his efforts towards sports administration and from 1981 to 1984 he was President of the International Badminton Federation (IBF). In 1992, he became the Chairman of the British Olympic Association (BOA), serving in that capacity for more than a decade, and for which role he was knighted on retiring in 2005. In 1994, in addition to his British role, Reedie joined the International Olympic Committee (IOC), where he is currently one of four United Kingdom representatives, the others being the Princess Royal, Sir Philip Craven and Adam Pengilly. In addition to his post on the IOC, Reedie was also on the board of the London 2012 Organising Committee, the body tasked with preparing for the 2012 Summer Olympics that were held in London. He was also appointed to the Board of the Olympic Lottery Distributor in 2006. Reedie also served on the Evaluation Commission for the bids for the 2016 Summer Olympics which was won by Rio de Janeiro. He also led the Evaluation Commission for the 2020 Summer Olympics that were awarded to Tokyo over Istanbul and Madrid, the three remaining cities on a shortlist that previously included Baku, Doha and Rome. On 9 October 2009, at the 121st IOC Session in Copenhagen, after two previous failed attempts, Reedie was elected to the International Olympic Committee's Executive Board. He is the first Briton to have a seat on the board since 1961. He became a Vice-President of the IOC in July 2012. Beyond his involvement in the Olympic movement, Reedie has been involved in the World Anti-Doping Agency since its foundation in 1999, serving as the inaugural chair of WADA's Finance and Administration Committee and as a member of its Executive Committee and Foundation Board. In November 2013 Reedie was elected as WADA's third president, commencing his three-year term on 1 January 2014.  Honours  Reedie was first appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). In 2006 he gained further recognition, with the award of a knighthood from the Queen, gaining the formal title of Sir Craig Reedie, CBE. Reedie was also awarded an Honorary Degree by the University of Lincoln in the 2010 Graduation ceremonies. In 2001 his life's achievements were recognised with an honorary doctorate from the University of Glasgow, and in 2005 Scotland's oldest university, the University of St Andrews made him an honorary Doctor of Law (LLD). In 2018 Queen's Birthday Honours, he was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) for services to sport.

There was widespread suspicion among members of the public that job offer was a quid pro quo for the favours he allegedly granted to its parent company, New World Development (NWD), in 2004. The Civil Service Bureau (CSB), which was responsible for vetting the appointments of former civil servants against potential conflicts of interest, admitted to failing in their duty to consider all relevant factors.  Background  In 2004, while Leung was Director of Housing, the government sold an unused Private Sector Participation Scheme project. The sale of the Hung Hom Peninsula HOS housing estate to NWD took place at less than half of the original asking price. In November 2005, Leung was criticised in an Audit Commission report, for having exercised his discretionary power before conferring with other government departments in 2001. Henderson Land Development had been granted permission to exclude the public transport terminus from the gross floor area in its building plan for their Grand Promenade development, thus gaining additional revenues of HK$3.2 billion as a result of the decision. The effect was to allow the addition of 10,700 square meters to the project.  Procedural rules  { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:25em; max-width: 30%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\"  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Extract from LC Paper No. CB(1)1786/03-04(03) \\"Policy governing the acceptance of post-retirement employment of civil servants\\" The basic principle to follow in considering applications is that there should be no impropriety in the proposed employment. In this regard, the Administration takes into account the following factors ‚Äì *(a) whether the officer, while serving in the Government, was involved in policy formulation or decision which could have benefited his prospective employer; *(b) whether the prospective employer might gain an unfair advantage over competitors because of the officer's previous knowledge and experience; and *(c) the public perception of the officer taking up the proposed business or employment. } Directorate officers wishing to take up outside work, paid or unpaid, full-time or part-time, during their final leave period before their formal departure from the Government and/or within a specified control period counting from the said departure, should apply for prior permission from the Secretary for the Civil Service (SCS) in accordance with detailed arrangements set out in CSB Circular No. 10/2005. According to procedures drawn up, civil servants of Leung's grade are subject to a 12-month 'sterilisation period' and required government approval to take up private sector posts within three years of leaving. Procedures laid down required that views from the relevant bureaux be taken into account.  Approval and conditions  The Secretary for the Civil Service, Denise Yue Chung-yee, signed off on the approval for him to take up the job after it passed through the Advisory committee on post-service employment of civil servants, responsible for vetting the appointment. The Transport and Housing Bureau, the Development Bureau and Administrative Officer Grade Management were asked for their views. On receiving these submissions, the CSB prepared a paper for the Advisory committee to facilitate their consideration. The view taken by the CSB was that Leung would oversee only mainland business of his future employer, and that bearing in mind he had ceased to be Director of Buildings for six years, and had left the post of Permanent Secretary of Housing two years previously, his appointment was \\"unlikely to present problems of conflict of interest\\". In order to address any potential public perception issue, additional conditions were imposed in addition to the standard set of conditions. Accordingly, Leung's employment was to be confined to New World China Land, not represent his employer in dealings with the Government, would refrain from involvement in any Hong Kong related dealings of his direct employer, and not to disclose sensitive or classified information to his employer. On 4 July 2008, the committee submitted its recommendation to the SCS to approve Leung's appointment, and the SCS duly gave her approval on 8 July, on the terms stipulated.  Reaction  For many citizens, the incident was proof that there was collusion between the government and big business. Controversies surrounded not only the suspicions of Leung's own conflict of interest, but also of the insensitivity of the committee which recommended the approval for him to take up his new job with a HK$3.12 million pay packet, plus bonus, so soon after his retirement. Mr. Justice Pang Kin-kee, who chaired the vetting committee, was also himself criticised for conflict of interest for his close friendship with Leung. Political scientist Ma Ngok said \\"It is inevitable that the public will consider the advisory committee to be just a rubber stamp when the approval rate was 100%.\\" Albert Cheng commented: \\"[the] controversial appointment is a political time bomb, which threatens to seriously undermine the authority of the administration.\\" Senior Non- Expatriate Officers Association chairman Poon Wai-ming argued that the controversy arose from a lack of strict enforcement of the procedures, and not their inadequacies. New World argued that they hired Leung in good faith after government clearance. Albert Chan of the League of Social Democrats and 50 members of the public filed a complaint with the Independent Commission Against Corruption days after his appointment became public. The Secretary for the Civil Service came under fire for approving an appointment that gives the strong appearance of a conflict of interest. Chief Executive Donald Tsang asked the Secretary for the Civil Service to account for the approval process in a written report. On 13 August 2008, Apple Daily reported that the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office had asked the Hong Kong government to solve the problem on or before 24 August, and that the best way forward would be for Leung to resign from NWD. However, The Standard reports that the Apple assertions \\"could not be substantiated\\". However, an unnamed top Beijing official in Hong Kong was quoted in the South China Morning Post as warning, without specifically identifying the subject he was referring to, that conflicts among interest groups may threaten Hong Kong's stability if not properly handled.  SCS report  On 15 August, the Civil Service Bureau issued the report requested by Donald Tsang where they admitted that they had not considered Leung's role in the Hung Hom Peninsula affair when approving his application, and was thus not mentioned in the report to the Advisory Committee or the subsequent submission to the SCS. Although the Works branch and the Transport and Housing branch suggested that there may be a \\"public perception issue\\", neither believed that the appointment was \\"[likely to].. create a negative impact or embarrass the government\\" because his role was in mainland subsidiary. Donald Tsang asked the SCS to reassess the approval, and submit a report to him. New World Development announced in the early hours of 16 August that Leung had resigned from his post, and would not be seeking compensation from the government, for its \\"inappropriate handling\\". Leung professed his \\"shock\\" to learn that officials had not considered his role in the Hung Hom Peninsula sale, and tendered his resignation. It was understood that the reassessment by the SCS would take place notwithstanding Leung's resignation.  Political fallout  Yue lost credibility within and outside government circles as a result of the case, but said she hoped to stay in her position. Commentator Chris Yeung stated that Tsang's request for the bureaux to do their job again deals a body blow to the authority and image of Yue and the bureaux. A SCMP editorial criticised the \\"glaring lack of political sense of some of our senior officials.\\" Lee Wing-tat said it was clear from the episode that the government considered the public stupid. Albert Cheng pointed to the composition of the four-man Advisory committee, saying that issues would have been flagged had it included pan-democrats instead of just establishment figures. There were only muted calls for Secretary's resignation. Commentators suggested that parties feared that demands for Yue's resignation would alienate civil servants in the forthcoming LegCo elections. The next day, Donald Tsang confirmed that Denise Yue would not have to resign. He was satisfied with her apology and with the explanations offered by her. Tsang ordered a committee, of which Yue was to be a member, to be set up to perform a sweeping review of the system to process applications for former civil servants. This sparked fears among civil servants that their job opportunities after retirement would be curtailed. In an op-ed, Christopher Cheung states that Leung was quickly sentenced by the court of public opinion, and was \\"dangerously close to mob rule\\". The facts of the case rested on guidelines introduced in January 2006 which \\"elevate public opinion to the level of tyranny\\", and whose rigid entry and exit criteria from the civil service stand in the way of modernising the civil service.

The church was built in 1199 established by Baldwin IX, Count of Flanders. The church is situated in the historic city centre of Kortrijk.  Collegiate church a Gargoyle on the outside Altar piece, work by Anthony van Dyck The church played a mayor role in the history of the County of Flanders. The original chapel was situated within the domain of the Counts of Flanders which was, except the part along the River Lys, fully walled. By request of Balduin IX and his wif Mary of Champagne the chapel was extended and became church. Inside a collegiate chapter with 12 canons in honour of our lady was installed by request of the Count. This chapter received papal approbation in 1203 by Pope Innocent III.Aken of Jeruzalem?: het ontstaan en de hervorming van de kanonikale instellingen in Vlaanderen tot circa 1155, Volume 1/Leuven University Press, 2000 - pag 596 Th count provided himself the Prebendaries and gave important relics, that came from Jerusalem with the crusades. The chapter was considered one of the most important of Flanders. After the Battle of the Golden Spurs in 1302, which took place nearby on the Groeningekouter, the Flemish people hung 500 Golden Spurs of killed French knights on the ceiling of the church. Mercenaries took them away, in 1382 after the Battle of Roosebeke. They were replaced by replicas which can still be seen in the church. In 1370, Count Louis II of Flanders had the Count‚Äôs chapel built to be a mausoleum for himself and in honour of Saint Catharine. The Chapel contains Frescos of all the counts and Governors of Flanders, during the Spanish and Austrian period. During the 15th century, the church was renovated. The castle wasn't restored and the domain was parcelled out (O.L.V.-straat, Konventstraat, Guido Gezellestraat, Kapittelstraat and Pieter de Cockelaerestraat). Only the church, the Broeltowers and the Artillery tower are the remains of the former medieval castle.  19th century  In 1797, French troops invaded the city. They chased the canons out of their church and together with 12 convents, chapels and churches, the church was sold. The archives of the Chapter were brought to the city archives and other possessions were destroyed. Thanks to the concordat between Napoleon Bonaparte and Pope Pius VII, the church became the parish church of the parish of Our Lady. The canons never returned. Guido Gezelle was the priest of this parish between 1872 and 1889.  Interior The church is currently still used as a parish church, most of the interior dates from the late Baroque period. The mean organ is sculpted in Rococo style, built by Van Peteghem. The church also contains other important treasures such as the altarpiece of Anthony van Dyck‚Äôs Raising of the Cross. This painting was commanded by the reverend canon Roger Braye, dating 1631. In the choir chapels we can find important graves and memorials. In the south a small door gives access to the gothic \\"Gravenkapel\\". After the Second World War some parts needed to be restored.

Biography Sokolov was born on May 26, 1896 in Labinskaya Stanitsa (now Labinsk), Russia. He studied at Kiev Institute of Peoples Education and graduated in 1921. He taught at the Applied Mathematics Division of the Academy. He completed his PhD from Kiev University. His doctorate advisor was Dmitry Grave. His doctorate thesis was in the area of mechanics of particles. After completing his PhD, Sokolov taught at the Institute of Mathematics at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. He also taught at many other institutions in Kiev. Sokolov died on February 2, 1971 in Kiev, Ukraine, USSR. Research Sokolov did research on the n-body problem for nearly 50 years. He summarized his work in the 1951 book Singular trajectories of a system of free material points (Russian). He did research on functional equations and on such practical problems as the filtration of groundwater. He also did research on celestial mechanics and hydromechanics. Sokolov is also known for 'the averaging method with functional corrections' or 'the Sokolov method'. This method is for finding approximate solutions to differential and integral equations. Sokolov wrote the book The method of averaging of functional corrections (1967), in which he summaries his many important work. He wrote the book at an elementary level. First part of the book discusses applications of his method to problems which can be modelled by linear integral equations with constant limits. A number of different sufficient conditions for the approximations to converge and presents error estimates were given. The next three parts of the book first examines the problems which can be modelled by nonlinear integral equations with constant limits and then extend the analysis to the situation where the upper limit is variable. In the final part of the book, Sokolov's methods to integral equations of mixed type are examined. He also presented some generalizations of the method in a number of appendices.

Early life Fatimah el-Sharif was born in Italian Libya in 1911, the fifth daughter of Ahmed Sharif as-Senussi, the former chief (3rd) of the Senussi order of Sufism. Her father was active in resistance against colonial forces. Her mother Khadija, Ahmed Sharif's second wife, was a daughter of general Ahmad al-Rifi (d. on 3 September 1911 in Kufra), distinguished elder statesman of the brotherhood and the last surviving personal companion of the Grand Senussi. In 1929, she was forced to flee on camel to Egypt from Marshall Rodolfo Graziani. In 1931, she married her cousin Idris of Libya, then Emir of Cyrenaica and her father's successor, in Siwa Oasis. Their only son died in 1953, aged one day old.  Queenship  Queen Fatimah (left) on a visit to Egypt with Tahia Kazem, First Lady of Egypt Upon her husband's accession as King of Libya in 1951, Fatimah became Queen. In 1954, her nephew assassinated Idris' advisor Ibrahim al-Shelhi because of a rumour that Shelhi had convinced the King to divorce Fatima in favour of a marriage with his own daughter. Idris then ordered the execution of Fatima's nephew. Salah Busir, who would later be Libya's foreign minister, sent a letter to Elizabeth II asking her to convince Idris to stop the execution, but he was unsuccessful. When Idris decided to obey the demands to remarry in order to have an heir, Fatimah selected two women as prospective brides: he chose neither of them, but instead an Egyptian heir appointed by his premier, Alia Abdel Kader Lamloum, whom he married in 1955. As there was no divorce, Fatimah refused to leave the royal residence in Tobruk, and after a couple of months, she and Idris reconciled.  Post-revolution and death Fatimah was in Turkey with her spouse at the time of Muammar Gaddafi's coup in 1969. With the help of the Turkish government they returned from the resort town of Borsa to Kanmena Yourla in Greece. On 13 September she wrote to their lifetime friend Eric Armar Vully de Candole, CBE, who held the post of Her Britanic Majesty‚Äôs Resident, Cyrenaica: \\"We could not answer your cables and letters as I was alone with my husband when the coup took place without any money at all until the Turkish Government came to our help, paid our hotel and arranged our journey to Greece.\\" She wrote to Mr. de Candole again on 26 October: \\"The weather here is cold and Ramadan will soon start and we cannot perform fasting obligations in any European Country. It is the will of God and may it be for the benefits of all. We shall sail next Friday for Alexandria and the same day get to Cairo.\\"\\"The Life and Times of King Idris of Libya\\", by E. A. V. De Candole She subsequently lived in Cairo from 3 November 1969 until her death. Fatimah was later tried in absentia by the Libyan People's Court and sentenced in November 1971 to five years in prison and seizure of her assets. Her house in Tripoli was returned to her in 2007. Fatimah died on 3 October 2009 in Cairo, aged 98. Her body was flown to Saudi Arabia for burial at Al-Baqi' in Medina beside her husband and her father accompanied by her longtime companions and servants Dr. Nafa al-Arabi al-Senussi, his wife Alia Benghalbon, and her longtime friend Amina Darbi. Saudi Arabia denied her family permission to bury her in Al-Baqi'. Her body was finally laid to rest in the Hamza Cemetery near Mount Uhud in Medina on 7 October 2009 after salat al-Janazah in al-Masjid an-Nabawi. Personality The relationship between Queen Fatimah and King Idris is described as a mutually happy one, and they became foster-parents to several children of relatives, as well their adopted Algerian daughter Suleima, whose father had been killed fighting against France in Algeria's war of independence. Fatimah was described as humorous and tactful, with an ability to make people relax, especially children. She also was a most loyal supporter of Idris, with a simple but elegant style. Fatimah also became a role model for a new way of life for the women of Libya by her role as a queen. As a queen, she played a visible role in society, and was present regularly at various public events.

He fronted the hardcore punk band SNFU from 1981 until their hiatus in 2018. Other, short-lived groups that he led included The Wongs, Little Joe, and Slaveco. Chinn was an energetic vocalist, prolific artist, and sardonic lyricist. He was also an early advocate for queer identity in punk rock. His struggles with addiction and mental health problems were well documented,Open Your Mouth and Say...Mr. Chi Pig, Film, Dir: Sean Patrick Shaul, 2010. and he died of undisclosed health issues at age 57. Early life and career Born to German and Chinese parents in Edmonton, Chinn was the second youngest of twelve children. His early life entailed traumatic episodes related to his unstable family, including manifestations of what would later be diagnosed as schizophrenia. Despite this, he remained close to his siblings and parents, who were important influences. As a teenager, he developed interests in punk rock, skateboarding, and art. In 1981, Chinn formed the punk rock band Live Sex Shows with Marc and Brent Belke, twin brothers whom he had met through the skateboarding subculture.Chris Walter. ...What No One Else Wanted to Say. Vancouver: GFY Press, 2012 (first edition) The group was short-lived, but the three musicians next formed Society's No Fucking Use, soon to be known by the acronym SNFU, late that year. SNFU rose in prominence in the Canadian hardcore punk community and ultimately became a formative influence for the skate punk subgenre, beginning with their 1985 debut ...And No One Else Wanted to Play. In addition to singing, Chinn wrote the group's lyrics and provided much of the artwork used on their records. He also served as an energetic and charismatic performer, incorporating masks, puppets, and other props into the band's stage show. While touring behind their second LP, If You Swear, You'll Catch No Fish, Chinn suffered a head injury that he later cited as a cause of his mental and physical decline. Though the band continued to find increasing success, they suffered from in-fighting, much centering around Chinn and the other members. After three LPs with a changing rhythm section and extensive touring in North America and Europe, SNFU disbanded in 1989 due to creative disagreements and general exhaustion. Move to Vancouver and height of commercial success Chinn relocated to Vancouver in early 1990 and formed The Wongs.Walter 2012: 120 This band released a cassette and toured briefly with Gorilla Gorilla, a group then featuring Bif Naked and Randy Steffes, before disbanding the following year. Another short-lived group, Little Joe, followed soon thereafter, who were active sporadically for the next two years and recorded a demo in 1992. After moving to Vancouver, Chinn began what would become a long battle with hard drug addiction. This period also marked the beginning of Chinn's open identification as a homosexual. In late 1991, SNFU reformed for a reunion tour behind The Last of the Big Time Suspenders, a rarities compilation released to satisfy their contract with Cargo Records. The tour was successful, and the reinvigorated band properly reunited, signing to Epitaph Records in 1993. Their five years of activity with Epitaph resulted in three studio albums and the greatest industry prominence in the band's career; the records reached six-digit record sales and SNFU toured alongside successful punk rock acts like Green Day and Bad Religion. Chinn's mental and physical health began to diminish during this era, however, due both to increased drug use and the trauma he faced following the death of his mother. Late in 1997, Epitaph opted against renewing the band's contract. This resulted in heavy band debt and the departure of Brent Belke and longtime drummer Dave Rees; the remaining members nevertheless kept the band active as a four-piece for the first time in its career while seeking a new recording contract. This era ultimately ended after the departure of longtime bassist Rob Johnson and a hiatus in 2001. Personal struggles and third SNFU incarnation Chinn then formed the new group Slaveco. with Matt Warhurst and Shane Smith, both future members of SNFU, and Jay Black. SNFU returned to activity late in 2003, releasing In the Meantime and In Between Time, their seventh studio album, and touring subsequently before again disbanding in 2005 due to further exhaustion and disagreements. Slaveco. became inactive shortly thereafter, and Chinn spiraled into depression, poverty, and addiction, which ultimately resulted in his homelessness. Nonetheless, Chinn at this time began work on an unfinished solo album in collaboration with other Vancouver musicians, including Johnson. Chinn and former SNFU bassist Ken Fleming, now on guitar, began playing sets of SNFU material with a new rhythm section in 2007 before deciding to reform the band officially. Later joined by early drummer Jon Card and several new members, this third incarnation of SNFU spent the next several years touring Europe, Canada, and Central America. Open Your Mouth and Say... Mr. Chi Pig, a biographical documentary film about Chinn, was released in March 2010. Produced by the Canadian company Prairie Coast Films and directed by Sean Patrick Shaul, the film told the story of Chinn's life and career, containing interview footage with such notables as Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys, Brendan Canning of Broken Social Scene, and Joey Keithley of D.O.A. citing SNFU's influence on them personally and the rock scene at large. The film also documented Chinn's struggles with addiction and ill health, and the escape from these conditions that the 2007 SNFU reunion represented. In 2011, Chinn suffered from severe pneumonia, and SNFU became fractured following various members' emigrations. Despite this, the group managed to tour the following year in support of the band's official biography, Chris Walter's ...What No One Else Wanted to Say, released via GFY Press. Chinn also began performing solo acoustic sets, sometimes billed as DNFU (Distortion's No Fucking Use), in 2013. This same year, SNFU released Never Trouble Trouble Until Trouble Troubles You, their eighth and final studio album, before this lineup disbanded. From 2014 to 2017, Chinn led new lineups of SNFU featuring former bassist Dave Bacon, Steffes, guitarist Kurt Robertson, and several drummers across various Canadian and European tours. The final SNFU performances occurred in Europe early in 2017. Though the band intended to continue, they announced a hiatus in early 2018 due to Chinn's health. Illness and death After Chinn became too ill to continue performing with SNFU, he focused his attention on his art.Walter, Chris. ...What No One Else Wanted to Say, Vancouver: GFY Press, 2020 (third edition), pg. 269.

According to Alonso Hern√°ndez del Portillo, the first historian of Gibraltar, its name is derived from a similar grotto in Monte Gargano near the Sanctuary of Monte Sant'Angelo in Apulia, Italy, where the archangel Michael is said to have appeared. It is the most visited of the more than 150 caves found inside the Rock of Gibraltar,Gibraltar Info - St. Michael's Cave receiving almost 1,000,000 visitors a year.Duquesa - St. Michael's Cave History Creation The cave was created by rainwater slowly seeping through the limestone rock, turning into a weak carbonic acid which gradually dissolved the rock. Through this process, tiny cracks in The Rock's geological fault grew into long passages and large caverns over thousands of years. The numerous stalactites and stalagmites in the cave are formed by an accumulation of traces of dissolved rock deposited by water dripping from the ground above. Prehistory In 1974 a Neolithic bowl was discovered in the cave, one of many examples which prove that the cave was known to prehistoric humans. Another would be the recently discovered cave art depicting an ibex drawn in charcoal on one of the cave walls. It has been dated to the solutrean period (15,000 to 20,000 years ago) based on the style used.The Gibraltar Museum - Cave Art discovered in St. Michael's Cave However, since two Neanderthal skulls have been discovered in Gibraltar, it is possible that they were among the first to set foot in the cave around 40,000 BC. Ancient world The first factual description of the cave was written in 45 AD by Pomponius Mela, an Algeciras-born geographer. He described Gibraltar as: > A mountain with wonderful concavities, which has its western side almost > opened by a large cave which may be penetrated far into the interior. However, the writings of Homer as well as artifacts discovered in the cave show that it was already well known to the ancient Greeks, Romans and Phoenicians. Spanish period The name Cueva de San Miguel (the current English name is a direct translation of the Spanish toponym) is recorded by Gibraltar's first historian, Alonso Hern√°ndez del Portillo, in his Historia de la Muy Noble y M√°s Leal Ciudad de Gibraltar (). In his work, Hern√°ndez del Portillo also suggests the cave's name is taken from the similar grotto in Apulia, Italy. 18th century During the first century of the British period, there are some records of the attempt by the new owners of the Rock to change the name of the cave using the name of the English patron Saint, Saint George. However, the new name, St. George's Cave, was not widely adopted and, although still used in the 19th century, has not remained in use, being replaced by the cave's original name. 19th century St. Michael's Cave in 1830, an engraving by Louis Auguste de Sainson. 19th-century painting of St. Michael's Cave by Thomas Colman Dibdin. During the Victorian era the cave was used as a venue for picnics, parties, concerts, weddings and even duels. The caves would be decorated for many of these events and even illuminated for distinguished visitors by soldiers who would perch on stalagmites with torches. The first official archaeological excavation of the cave was carried out by the Governor of the military prison, Captain Frederick Brome, commencing in April 1863 and continuing until December 1867. He discovered numerous prehistoric artifacts such as stone axes and arrow heads, shell jewelry, and bone needles as well as a large collection of pottery. Despite his archeological efforts, Brome's unauthorised use of prisoners' labour eventually cost him his job. Officers looking for adventure during quiet periods of their service, would pass their time exploring the many passages within the cave system. Sometime before 1840, a Colonel Mitchell and a second officer got lost in the caves and were never seen again. Their disappearance led to extensive explorations of the cave system in 1840, 1857 and 1865, but no evidence of the officers' whereabouts was found. Further exploration was carried out between 1936 and 1938, when a scientific expedition was mounted and every known part of the cave system was explored, but again no human remains were found. Military use It is believed that St. Michael's Cave has had a military use since the Berber general Tariq ibn Ziyad led the Umayyad conquest of Hispania in 711 AD. This is assumed due to the defensive wall of Moorish origin which protected the cave's entrance until recently. Just after Gibraltar's capture by Anglo-Dutch forces in 1704, 500 Spanish troops concealed themselves within the cave overnight after having ascended through a path led by goatherd Sim√≥n Susarte, before an unsuccessful attempt to surprise the garrison. =World War II= During World War II the entire cave was prepared for use as an emergency military hospital. It was never used as such. New St. Michael's Cave In 1942, it was decided that an alternate entrance was required to improve air circulation within the emergency hospital in the lower chambers of the cave, as well as to serve as an emergency exit in case of airstrike. Whilst blasting the rock in order to create the extra opening, another deeper system of caves known as New St. Michael's Cave (sometimes referred to as Lower St. Michael's Cave) were discovered. The series of descending chambers are riddled with examples of almost all known cave formations, including an underground lake of crystal clear water. Present day Auditorium The auditorium stage at the Cathedral Cave. The largest of the chambers, named the Cathedral Cave, currently serves as an auditorium. It was converted due to the chamber's natural acoustic properties. It is equipped with a concrete stage and has a seating capacity of over 100. It has been a regular venue for events such as dramas and son et lumi√®re shows as well as the annual Miss Gibraltar beauty pageant. The cave is also used to hold concerts of all music genres, from operas and philharmonic orchestras to pop and rock. Notable acts who have performed in the cave include Steve HogarthGovernment of Gibraltar Press Release - Steve Hogarth concert to take place in St. Michael's Cave and Breed 77.Gibraltar Autumn Festival of Art and Culture Programme of Events The Gibraltar World Music Festival is also held here each year. In 2016 English comedian Mark Steel recorded an episode of his long running BBC Radio 4 comedy series Mark Steel's in Town in the cave . Tourism Presently the cave is one of Gibraltar's top tourist attractions and is open daily to the public receiving almost 1,000,000 visitors a year. The cave formations are colourfully lit and visitors can read displays documenting the caves' history. St. Michael's Cave can be reached by car, taxi, cable carCosta del Sol - St. Michael's Cave or by foot. Tickets include entrance to two of the other major tourist sites on The Rock: the Moorish Castle and the Great Siege Tunnels. Guided tours of Lower St. Michael's Cave can also be arranged through the Gibraltar Tourist Board. The cave is in a completely natural state, although fully lit and kitted out with ropes to aid minor climbing and scrambling. Safety helmets are provided and comfortable non-slip shoes are recommended. Legend * The Cathedral Cave was long thought to be bottomless, making St. Michael's Cave the subject of one of Gibraltar's most famous legends. It was believed that the cave is one end of a subterranean Ley tunnel over 15 miles (24 km) long which passes under the Strait of Gibraltar. Legend has it that the Barbary macaques entered the Rock from Morocco this way.Government of Gibraltar - St. Michael's Cave * As the Rock of Gibraltar was thought to be one of the legendary Pillars of Hercules, the Ancient Greeks also believed the cave be the Gates of Hades, an entrance to the underworld.

His name occurs in the year-books from 1366, the fortieth year of Edward III, onwards. Life In 1377, the last year of the reign of Edward III, he became a King's Serjeant. He was appointed a judge of the common pleas in 1383 (Cal. Rot. Parl. p. 208), and at Christmas 1384 he was made a Knight banneret.Dugdale, Orig. Jur. pp.46, 103 On 25 Aug. 1387 he was summoned to attend the king at Nottingham and concurred with his colleagues in pronouncing illegal the proceedings of the last parliament, which had appointed a permanent council. For this expression of opinion he was on 3 February 1388 arrested while sitting in court, and on 2 March was put on his trial. He pleaded that he had been compelled to give that opinion by the threats of the Archbishop of York and of the Earl of Suffolk, but he was found guilty by parliament. Upon the intercession of the prelates, his life was spared, and his sentence commuted to banishment for life to Ireland, an allowance of forty marks being made him for his residence at Drogheda. In 1391 his manors were granted to his son John, but in January 1397 parliament remitted his banishment, and in the following year his sentence was reversed and his land was restored. The deposition of Richard II prevented him from recovering the lands. In the second year of the following reign he presented a petition for their restoration, which was granted, but many of them having been granted away in the interim he was compelled to allow the grantees such compensation as the council should think reasonable, and on these terms his lands were restored to him, and passed to his son Hugh on his death in 1418.Foss, Lives of the JudgesCal.

In its heyday it had 118 residents and its own school, post office and grocery store. The station was an interchange between the Border Counties Railway branch to Hexham and the North British Railway's (NBR's) Border Union Railway (also known as the Waverley Route). History The settlement of Riccarton, which adjoins the station, consisted, in 1959, of around thirty houses, with at least one member of each household working for British Railways, which had a civil engineer's depot near the station. Remarkably there was no road access until a forest track was built in 1963, all access until then being by rail. The isolated position of Riccarton and the need to provide for the villagers may have been one reason why the station remained open until the late 1960s, as by this time ordinary public traffic was virtually non-existent. The branch line from Riccarton Junction to and in England was closed on 15 October 1956. The Waverley Route was closed on 6 January 1969. Part of it was re-opened in 2015 as the Borders Railway, but not as far south as Riccarton Junction. Reuse (and Preservation) Track panels were re-laid by the now wound-up Friends of Riccarton Junction, but these were later lifted in 2011.\\"Disused Stations - Riccarton Junction\\"Disused Stations Site Record; Retrieved 17 May 2016 The Waverley Route Heritage Association have since reconstructed a section of track between Whitrope Siding and Tunnel as a heritage railway; this is not connected to the site at Riccarton itself. The association, having secured a three-year lease on the two-mile section to the site, are aiming to restore this section of the former route from its base at Whitrope down the line into the Junction as the southern terminus of the preserved line. In the Media Ian Nairn visited the station three years after its closing in his 1972 programme Nairn Across Britain: From Leeds into Scotland.

The facade of the late-Gothic, early Renaissance city hall is adorned with the statues of the Counts of Flanders.  History  As early as the 14th century, Kortrijk possessed a town hall, which was, however, completely gutted down by the French army after the victory at Westrozebeke in 1382. In 1420, a larger town hall was built in High Gothic style. The pointed arches in the hall on the ground-flour and upstairs are the only remnants of that building. The present city hall was erected about 1520 in a style composed of Gothic and Renaissance elements. It was considerably larger than its predecessor. The front was gilded and polychromed (as the front of the Brussels town hall still is). In 1526, statues of the principal Counts of Flanders were put into niches, which so far had housed prophets' statues. In 1616 the town hall was once more enlarged, with a part of the front in the extant style. From the end of the 17th and throughout the 18th centuries, the front underwent a series of alterations and mutilations. They did not hesitate to set up a pillory against it. In 1807, during the French occupation, the statues and their canopies were removed and the front was flattened out according to the spirit of the age. Around 1850 the front was renovated, but not too successfully. Even while in progress, the artistic value of the restoration was questioned. In 1854, the festive hall was fitted up on the occasion of a visit by king Leopold II and the Queen. In 1934, the historic Council Chamber was likewise taken in hand. In 1938, the first plans were drawn for the restoration of the building to its 16th-century state. The actual works lasted from 1958 to 1961.  Interior  In the city hall, you also find the beautiful Aldermen‚Äôs hall and the Council chamber with 16th century sculpted chimneys. They are decorated with stained glass, wall murals and peculiar topographical maps. Aldermen‚Äôs hall, the Vierschaar For several years now, the historic Aldermen's Chamber, which had been a tribunal (vierschaar) up to 1787, has been used as wedding-room and as reception hall. The magnificent mantelpiece in late gothic style was completed in 1527. The mural paintings, made in 1875 after the romantic fashion of that time, depict outstanding scenes of Kortrijk's history. The stained-glass windows show the city's coat of arms and those of the 13th century craft guilds (principally textile workers). Council chamber In this hall, one can find fine gothic arches and a beautiful wooden portico. The graceful mantelpiece, a real lace work out of stone, is undoubtedly the show- piece of the Kortrijk city hall.

Before the 20th century, the land that the park currently occupies was the main landfill of the city. The park is the initiative of Alberto Aguilera, the mayor of the city at the beginning of the 20th century, who in 1906 requested the layout of a place for walking and relaxation by landscape artist Celedonio Rodr√≠g√°√±ez. It has unique and beautiful sites such as \\"The Rose\\", which is held every year an international tender roses. One of the monuments in the park is the Temple of Debod, an Ancient Egyptian temple. The Egyptian state donated the temple of Debod to Spain in 1968 as a sign of gratitude for the help provided by Spain in saving the Abu Simbel temples. The Parque del Oeste is linked to the Casa de Campo by the Telef√©rico de Madrid, a gondola lift.  History  Work began in 1893 and the first phase was inaugurated in 1905. This phase included an approximate area of 87 hectares between the present streets of Moret, and Seneca, plus a car ride today Paseo de Camoes. In 1906, work continued work on the second phase, reaching the Cuartel de la Monta√±a (the current location of the Temple of Debod). It extended parallel to the Paseo del Pintor Rosales on old dumps. Bunker from the Battle of Ciudad Universitaria still standing in 2016 in the northern end of the park During the Civil War, Parque de Oeste became the battlefield of the Battle of Ciudad Universitaria, opening trenches and building bunkers that still can be seen at its northern end. The southern end of the park was the site of the siege of the Monta√±a barracks, (now demolished) in July 1936. Once the war ended, D. Cecilio Rodriguez, responsible for municipal parks, was responsible for its reconstruction, which lasted until the late 1940s. The landscape character, the type of planting and layout of the roads were respected. During the years 1956 and 1973, it has been extended, occupying the lands of Cuartel de la Monta√±a, building the Rose Garden and the Parque de la monta√±a, located in the Temple of Debod.

She belonged to the pioneer generation of performers of the Royal Swedish Opera. Hedvig Falk belonged to the first group of singers hired at the foundation of the Royal Swedish Opera in Bollhuset in 1773. She was at that point known for her musical talent and referred to as \\"one for her musical talent already well-known female\\", and Gustav III wanted her for the part of the goddess Doris in the opening grand opera Thetis och P√©l√©e, an opera in Swedish composed by Francesco Uttini with words by , which was to be performed at the inauguration of the new Opera. The employment of Wigert illustrates social and gender related issues. There was an initial difficulty to enroll female singers because the profession had a low status in the 18th- century. Wigert also illustrate the fact that people from the upper class participated in the Opera project of the king. Similar to the case of Elisabeth Olin, Wigert was a member of the upper class, and though she herself was willing to participate, her employment was delayed by the disapproval of \\"Two old powder-witches\\" in her family. Eventually, she was given a contract which stipulated that she would be allowed to resign whenever her family wished her to, as long as she participated in the inauguration performance.

Other roles was Corinna in Acis and Galathea by H√§ndel, and Euridyce in Oprpheus by Gl√ºck. She was described as unanimously admired, with a \\"noble\\" and versatile way of acting.

Construction and commissioning Kempenfelt was ordered in December 1941 and was laid down at the Clydebank yards of John Brown and Company. She was built as HMS Valentine, but this was changed to Kempenfelt as part of a rationalisation of the names used for the later wartime classes of destroyers. She was launched on 8 May 1943 and commissioned into service on 25 October 1943. During her time under construction she had been adopted by the civil community of Hammersmith after a successful Warship Week national savings campaign.

It grows in damp mossy grassland, in coniferous forest clearings, or on wooded heaths. It is probably the most common of the small genus Cystoderma. Possibly edible, it is not recommended due to its unpleasant odour and resemblance to poisonous species. Taxonomy Cystoderma amianthinum was first noted by the Italian-Austrian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli, who called it Agaricus amianthinus in 1772. The present generic name Cystoderma was erected by Swiss mycologist Victor Fayod in 1889, and is roughly translated as 'blistered skin', and is probably a reference to the appearance of the pellicle (cap skin). Description The cap is usually between in diameter, convex to bell-shaped, and later flat with a slight depression around a low umbo (central boss). It is dry and powdery, often with a shaggy or fringed margin (appendiculate), and is saffron-yellow or orange- ochre. The stem is cylindrical, and has a flaky-granular sheath beneath a fleeting, powdery ring. The gills are white initially, and become creamy later. They are adnexed (narrowly attached to the stem), and initially quite crowded. The spore print is white. The flesh is thin and yellowish, with an unpleasant mouldy smell. A very similar form with a markedly radially wrinkled cap, has been separated by some authors, and given the binomial Cystoderma rugoso-reticulatum. Cystodermella granulosa, and Cystodermella cinnabarina are both redder as a rule, and have adnate gills (broadly attached to the stem). Distribution and habitat Cystoderma amianthinum is widespread in Europe and North America, and common in northern temperate zones. It occurs in mossy woodland, on heaths, amongst grass or bracken, and sometimes with willow. It is often found on acidic soils. Edibility Cystoderma amianthinum is said to be edible, but of poor quality, and caution is strongly advised as the deadly toxic Lepiota castanea is a common lookalike.

Hong Kong is best known for its development of rugby sevens, an abbreviated code from Melrose in the Scottish Borders. Naturally it became popular amongst other groups in the city, particularly other white ex-patriates. Hong Kong Football Club was established in 1886, and played its first game of rugby against a 'Garrison XV' the same year. Prior to that it is likely that ad hoc games were organised by businessmen, such as HSBC. British forces sides would also have been prominent. Formal competition began in 1910-11 with a 'Triangular' tournament between HKFC, the Royal Navy and Army. This was expanded to a 'Quadrangular' in 1940 with the addition of a side from Hong Kong Police. After WWII the competition recommenced in 1947-48, becoming a 'Pentangular' in 1954 when the RAF joined in, and a year later a 'Hexangular' when the Army split their resources 'North and South'. Nevertheless, the HKRFU decreed in 1957 that however many teams there might be in the top flight competition, it would be known as the 'Pentangular' - and so it remained until 1975 when a 'Division 1' championship was instigated following the founding of two new civilian clubs, Valley in 1975 and Kowloon in 1976 (having previously competed as YMCA from 1974). In the late-1980s, the local Chinese began to participate more fully, with the establishment of a Police team of locals, the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme (DEA) had a team as did a team of Japanese, Gai Wu. With the booming of the HK economy came more and more expatriates, in 1992 a team of expat old boys of King George V School formed Typhoons and Aberdeen RFC was established in 1993. In the same year a team, with many local players Causeway Bay RFC was established. Women began playing full contact rugby in 1991, and a women's league, playing 7s, was set up in 1992. After a few seasons playing 10s, women's league is now full XV-a-side. Rugby caught on slowly but surely with the local population, thanks to HKRFU's constantly improving development programme, and the fact that many more local Chinese had played whilst in overseas education, and simply because rugby has been widely recognised as an excellent game to play. This fact is clear to see from the explosion of mini rugby in the local population since c.2000. Having previously been established by expat parents in 1979, the game expanded slowly through and the 1980s and became more and more attractive to local families as the 1990s went on. There are now rugby clubs in all parts of Hong Kong, and playing numbers are measure in 1000s, if not 10s of 1000s. The transfer of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China was not the total disaster for rugby there that some predicted. Since the handover, the Hong Kong Sevens continue to flourish, and there is increasing interest in the game within Mainland China as well. Hong Kong Sevens Because of the territory's small size, it was argued that rugby sevens would be more useful in promoting the game than 15-a-side. The Hong Kong Sevens have proven a powerful missionary force in Asia, allowing nations with small numbers of players to compete at a high level, and improve the standard of their game. Perhaps because of this high profile, Hong Kong was allowed to compete in the Asian Championship, a predecessor to the Asian Five Nations. Bill McLaren, in his autobiography Talking of Rugby writes at length about his Hong Kong Sevens experiences: :\\"I remember a big South Sea islander saying that, in his view, the Hong Kong sevens were really the Olympic Games of Rugby Union. Certainly, the Hong Kong event encapsulates all the really good things that the game has to offer ‚Äîsplendid organisation, wonderful sporting spirit, universal camaraderie, admirable field behaviour, the most enjoyable crowd participation, the chance for emergent rugby nations to lock horns with the mighty men of New Zealand, Australia, Fiji, Wales, Scotland and the Barbarians. There is, too, scintillating running and handling which is what the game is supposed to be all about.\\"McLaren, Bill Talking of Rugby (1991, Stanley Paul, London ), p 166 The Hong Kong Sevens (Chinese: È¶ôÊ∏ØÂúãÈöõ‰∏É‰∫∫Ê¨ñÁêÉË≥Ω) is considered the premier tournament on the IRB Sevens World Series in rugby union. The tournament was set up in 1976, and attracted clubs from Asia and beyond, from Indonesia, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Tonga, Japan, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Fiji for the first tournament alone. It was held at the Hong Kong Football Club in Happy Valley. After an initial proposal was refused by the Rugby Football Union in England, the HKRFU changed focus and sent out invitations to Asian and Pacific sides. The Rugby World Cup Sevens have been held twice in Hong Kong - see 1997 Rugby World Cup Sevens and 2005 Rugby World Cup Sevens. 2013 British and Irish Lions Tour to Australia The 2013 British and Irish Lions Tour to Australia started with a match against the Barbarians in Hong Kong. National team Hong Kong has two 15-a-side teams - men's and women's The men's team is a third tier rugby playing nation. They first played in 1952, the first local Chinese to be capped was CHAN Fuk-ping in 1994. These days, HK players consist of a mixture of both Hong Kong Chinese, and Caucasian players, with many being 'half-and-half'. They have competed in the first Asian Five Nations recently.

She was outfitted with guns and depth charges and sent into the dangerous waters of the North Atlantic Ocean to furnish data used to predict storm movement and severe weather conditions to safeguard the continuous movement of merchant convoys, naval warships, and airplanes between North America and the United Kingdom, Murmansk, and other destinations. She served as an escort vessel when required. She was manned by a U.S. Coast Guard crew and was eventually transferred to that agency as USCGC Monomoy (WAG-275).  Built in Duluth, Minnesota  Monomoy (AG-40) was built in 1918 by Globe Shipbuilding Co., Duluth, Minnesota; acquired as J. Floyd Massey, Jr 15 September 1941 from Steel Products Transportation Company, Buffalo, New York; renamed Monomoy 15 October 1941; and commissioned 24 December 1941.  World War II Navy service  Monomoy, manned and operated by the U.S. Coast Guard, joined the Weather Patrol, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, in 1942. From her base at Boston, Massachusetts, she periodically sailed to weather stations 1 and 2, where she provided weather reports vital for the safety of convoys and air commerce. Operating in dangerous waters, she made frequent contact with enemy submarines. At 9:07 PM on 24 July 1942 after spotting wake from two torpedoes crossing ten yards off the bow, the Officer of the Deck (Albert L. Preston) spotted a U-Boat periscope and conning tower. Four shots were fired from the 4\\" gun at 9:09 PM. The second, targeted at 2,000 yards, resulted in a metallic thud and a fire at the location of the U-Boat, which then disappeared from view. Two more shots were fired, followed by depth charges. No survivors were seen. She continued patrolling the North Atlantic, the North Sea, and the Bay of Biscay for the next 15 months. At times it took two men to control the ship's wheel in the rough seas. The ship rendered valuable service to Allied ships and planes in the North Atlantic. Transferred to the Coast Guard  She was formally transferred to the Coast Guard 22 October 1943, and stricken from the Naval Register 30 October. Redesignated WAG-275, Monomoy served the Coast Guard through the remainder of the war and was then transferred to the U.S. Maritime Commission. She was scrapped in 1951.

History The castle was first recorded in 1135. From 1447 on, it belonged to the Engl family of Steyr. In 1499, the property was raised to a noble estate by Emperor Maximilian I. Except for a religiously motivated break in 1620, the castle and its estate remained with the Engl family until the early 20th century. In 1717 the Engls were raised to Counts. With the death of Count Siegmund Engl in 1911, the male line became extinct. His daughter wedded a Count von Spiegelfeld. In 1950, the Spiegelfeld family sold the castle to the town of V√∂cklabruck. Since then, it has been used as a school and for cultural purposes. Schools The following schools have been hosted by the castle: * Bundesgymnasium V√∂cklabruck (High School) 1950‚Äì69 * H√∂here Technische Bundeslehranstalt V√∂cklabruck (Superior Federal Technical School) 1969‚Äì85 * Hauptschule II V√∂cklabruck/Hauptschule Regau (V√∂cklabruck Secondary General School No. II/Regau Secondary General School) 1985‚Äì93 * Bundesrealgymnasium V√∂cklabruck (High School) 1993‚Äìpresent Architecture The present castle consists of two of the formerly four round towers, a main building, and two wings. Two of the original towers were demolished during an expansion in the 18th century. Thereby the gateway tower was completely erased. In 1980, the household building east of the castle was torn down to be replaced by a workshop. By the erection of an annex building in 2000, the previously U-shaped facility was enclosed and a courtyard created. The annex is a modern reinforced concrete construction with a flat roof. Its courtward side is made up of glass. The two-storey old part features a hip roof and a mansard gable. On the gable's southern front, the Engl family coat of arms is engraved with its motto: \\"1448 F√ºrchte Gott, Tue Recht, Scheue Niemand 1848 (Fear God, Act Just, Eschew None)\\". The arcades of the supplementary buildings have been glazed. Due to the school, the site can only be inspected from outside.

In London, since the stage had recently been repositioned, the sound system was incorrectly set up resulting in the backing track being too quiet (at one point the band stopped playing and listened to the crowd's conversation instead until the sound engineer could adjust the volume). In Vienna, excessive rain threatened to flood the venue, and indeed succeeded in flooding the toilets. The performance nevertheless went ahead and was well received. Ultrafox later played in Client's gig \\"Being Boiled\\" in November 2004, again at the Notting Hill Arts Club. Style Ultrafox has been said to have a unique sound, described by Connie as \\"dark, sophisticated electronic sounds\\" and Claudia as \\"minimalistic, catchy and groovy\\". Their songs have a mix of German and English lyrics, and are usually based around a broken drum beat and a strong bass line. (On the track \\"I Get Lifted\\", the bass line is taken from Jeff Wayne's musical version of The War of the Worlds). They have been influenced by the likes of Kraftwerk, Michael Jackson, Def Leppard, Daft Punk and The Beach Boys. Current plans Ultrafox moved to London sometime after making Ice Skating, where recording studios and facilities for photography are more accessible. They stated they had begun working on a second album, but it has yet to materialise.

The building is located in the heart of the old part of Belgrade, in the urban neighborhood of Palilula, contiguously to the city park Tasmajdan, on Bulevar kralja Aleksandra. History The Faculty of Law, established in 1808 as part of the University of Belgrade, is one of the largest law schools in the region, with a long tradition of being a leader in the country‚Äôs legal education. In the beginning, the Countess Ljubica's Residence was home to this educational institution, which was at that time within the Belgrade Higher School. The law school has always rallied distinguished scholars and lecturers. Since its founding, it has educated almost 50,000 law graduates, around 1,200 magistri iuris and 830 doctores iuris, as well as hundreds of specialists in various areas. A great many Faculty of Law alumni have become recognized experts and scholars in all branches of law, law professors and high ranking government officials. Distinguished scholars include authorities, such as Slobodan Jovanoviƒá, Alexander Soloviev, Radomir Lukiƒá, Mehmed Begoviƒá and Mihailo ƒêuriƒá. The Faculty‚Äôs historic building, built by US millionaire Mile Bjelivuk in 1937, was upgraded in 1995 with additional premises, and now comprises about 12,000 sq. meters of space. All the faculties of law, established subsequently in Serbia (Subotica Law School, University of Novi Sad Faculty of Law, Pristina Law School, Ni≈° Law School, Kragujevac Law School), Montenegro (Podgorica Law School), and in other parts of the former Yugoslavia (Sarajevo Law School, Skoplje Law School) were formed from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law as a core. There is many professors at the various faculties of law in all the countries of the former Yugoslavia, who had obtained their academic titles at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law. The faculty has been awarded fifteen Fulbright Fellowships to do legal research in the United States, the most of any law school in Southeastern Europe. The Faculty of Law Belgrade Law School at night Library The academic law library in the region is located in the very Faculty building, occupying the area of around 2,000 sq. meters, with 600 sq. meters of reading rooms, one of which is reserved for researchers and teachers only. The Library collection comprises 138,000 monographs, 2,670 titles with 32,600 years of serial publications, reference collection with over 400 encyclopaedias, lexicons, dictionaries and other reference books, and a priceless collection of 91 rarities (featuring several 17th and 18th century editions of Justinian‚Äôs Codification, a singular edition of Corpus Iuris Canonici, etc.). Belgrade Law Review Annals of the Faculty of Law in Belgrade (Belgrade Law Review) is the oldest Southeastern European academic law journal, having been founded in 1906 as Archive for Legal and Social Sciences. The law review serves as a forum for the expression of the legal ideas of foremost scholars, jurists, and societal leaders. This peer-reviewed publication utilizes an international body of editors, advisers and referees to select outstanding contributions. Editors-in-Chief of the Belgrade Law Review are renowned professors Sima Avramovic and Alan Watson, who is credited for coining the term \\"legal transplants\\". In honor of Watson's worldwide scholarship, the Faculty of Law also established the Alan Watson Foundation.http://www.ius.bg.ac.rs/Anali/anali_e.htm Academic and professional gatherings European Forum Alpbach at the Belgrade Law School The faculty participates in numerous scholarly and professional events (both national and international) and regularly present their papers at conferences held annually by the national lawyers‚Äô associations such as the Kopaonik School of Natural Law, the Commercial Lawyers' Convention, numerous criminal law symposia, etc. Academic staff The University of Belgrade Faculty of Law has among its faculty some of the most eminent experts in various legal disciplines, as well as in a range of other social sciences (economy, sociology, philosophy, political science, legal history, etc.) Amongst them, there have been 19 members of the Academies of Sciences, 15 presidents of the University of Belgrade, six judges of the Constitutional Court of Serbia, many names recognized within the domestic and international academic community, as well as several dozens of high government officials ‚Äì Prime Ministers, Deputy Prime Ministers and Ministers, Ambassadors, etc. Miroljub Labus, Dejan Popoviƒá, Ga≈°o Kne≈æeviƒá and Kosta ƒåavo≈°ki are some of the current faculty. Competition in Oratory The traditional annual student Belgrade Competition in Oratory has become an event that attracts interest of the entire University and the general public. Following the example of the Faculty of Law in Belgrade, a number of other faculties organize their own competitions, the winners of which participate in the Serbian universities wide finals.http://www.ius.bg.ac.rs/eng/competition_in_oratory.htmhttp://www.nin.co.rs/2001-02/22/16720.htmlhttp://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Beograd/Nadmetanje- u-besednishtvu.lt.html International competitions Moot Court room Participating in inter-faculty competitions in different fields of practice at the national and international level is a great challenge to students. The student teams are coached by professors and teaching assistants, and they have achieved notable success in the past. Apart from national competitions in various fields, for a number of years the Faculty of Law has enabled its students to participate in international competitions, such as the William C. Vis International Commercial Arbitration Moot (in international commercial and arbitration Law), Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition (in international public law), Jean Pictet International Humanitarian Law Moot (in international humanitarian law), Clinical Legal History Competition (simulation of a court proceeding in ancient Athens), etc. Regarding Willem C. Vis Moot, since 2008, University of Belgrade Faculty of Law hosts an annual pre-moot competition better known as Belgrade Open. In 2010, 22 teams from 16 countries participated. Actual pre-moot rounds of Belgrade Open are, since 2009, preceded by an arbitration conference dealing with issues which were brought upon in that year's moot problem. In 2011, the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law team triumphed at the Monroe E. Price International Media Law Moot Court Competition at the University of Oxford. Student life Gym at the Belgrade Law School Student life at the Faculty does not merely revolve around lectures and exams, as there is a diverse array of student activities. There are many student organisations, of which Belgrade chapter of The European Law Students' Association, is one of the most active ones, organizing student exchange programmes throughout Europe. Students elect their representatives (Student Vice-Dean and the Student Parliament) to coordinate various student activities, represent their interests in the Faculty bodies, participate in the evaluation of studies and the faculty, and secure the involvement and participation of students in all matters and issues of interest to them. Students publish their own journal ‚Äì Pravnik (The Lawyer), take part in various competitions through their sports club Pravnik, stage plays through a drama society, organize discussion forums through the long lasting UN Club, whereas Oratory Centre Institutio oratoria gathers all those interested in developing public speaking skills and prepares them for competitions. The Society for Roman Law and Classics Forum Romanum has a particularly long and fine tradition. Established in 1970, it organizes discussion forums and social activities on a weekly basis. Over the years dozens of internationally renowned professors have participated in its activities, e.g. the late Regius Professor of Civil Law Peter Birks from Oxford. Degree programs Inauguration of a new academic year The law school practices a two-cycle system of studies: the first lasts four years (undergraduate studies) and the second lasts one year (Master studies). The undergraduate studies include mandatory courses, a selection of three major streams of study ‚Äì judicial-administrative, business law and legal theory, as well as a number of elective courses which students can choose according to their personal interests and preferences. The Master studies encompass two basic programs ‚Äì business law and administrative-judicial programs, as well as many so-called open Master programs in various areas. The law school has adopted and complies to the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System. In order to meet the challenge of serving a great number of students and maintaining high academic standards at the same time, a wide area of teaching methods are being used, ranging from lectures, seminars, study and advanced study groups (similar to honors classes in the U.S.), to mentor work and various other modern methods of teaching. Also, for the purpose of gaining practical skills, the law school organizes training courses, courses in legal writing, internships, the legal clinic, moot courts, and similar. Master and doctoral studies include degree programs in: Legal Theory, Legal History, Civil Law, Criminal Law, Business Law, Corporate Law, International Commercial Law, Law on Intellectual Property, Public International Law, Labor Law, Social security Law, Administrative Law and Public Administration, Constitutional Law and Political Systems, Legal and Economic Studies, Legal and Social Studies, European Union Law.

Wild was strongly in favour of continuing the War against Germany despite the heavy casualties and talk of a peace treaty. He argued that German atrocities against civilians made peace proposals unwise. 'Peace with an undefeated militarist Germany can only mean war and the endless threat of war for all time'.Newcastle Diocesan Gazette,July,1917. Wild was also keen to stress that post-War memorials should be 'for rich and poor alike',for everyone had fought for the same cause and had died as comrades together.Op cit December,1917He held that post until 1 August 1927 when he resigned due to poor health.

Initially stationed in the Mediterranean, she was assigned to the Navy's Caribbean fleet in 1740 and participated in Battle of Cartagena de Indias in 1741. Decommissioned later that year, she was restored to active service in the Caribbean in 1744. A navigational error on 16 February 1745 brought her too close to the shore of Antigua, where she was wrecked upon a submerged reef. Three of Weymouths officers were subsequently found guilty of negligence, with two required to pay substantial fines and the third sentenced to a two-year jail term. Description Weymouth was designed according to the 1733 proposals of the 1719 Establishment of dimensions.Lavery, Ships of the Line, vol. 1, p. 171. As built, she was long with a keel, a beam of , and a hold depth of . She was armed with twenty-four 24-pounder cannons located along her gundeck, supported by 26 nine-pounders on the upper deck and ten 6-pounders ranged along the quarterdeck and the forecastle.Winfield 2007, p.123 The designated complement was 400, comprising four commissioned officers a captain and three lieutenants overseeing 63 warrant and petty officers, 219 naval ratings, 67 Marines and 47 servants and other ranks. The 47 servants and other ranks provided for in the ship's complement consisted of 30 personal servants and clerical staff, six assistant carpenters, two assistant sailmakers, a steward's mate and eight widow's men. Weymouths marines were headed by a captain and second lieutenant, with four non-commissioned officers, a drummer boy and 60 private soldiers.Rodger 1986, pp.348351 Construction and career Weymouth, named after the eponymous port, was ordered on 6 January 1733. She was laid down in September at Plymouth Dockyard and was launched on 31 March 1736. Completed on 27 July 1739 at the cost of ¬£14,963, she commissioned under the command of Captain Lord Aubrey Beauclerk, but he was replaced by Captain Thomas Trefusis in July and the ship was sent to the Mediterranean. The following year the ship was commanded by Captain Charles Knowles and participated in the Battle of Cartagena de Indias in March 1741. Loss Weymouth was recommissioned for active service on 10 June 1744, under the command of Captain Warwick Calmady. Calmady had recently transferred aboard from the sixth-rate which had been paid off at Spithead the previous day. He brought most of Livelys crew with him, as Weymouth was short- handed while in ordinary. the next four months were spent in fitting out Weymouth for action at sea. She put to sea on 18 November 1744 to join a squadron under vice-admiral Thomas Davers, which was escorting a merchant convoy destined for the Caribbean. On 17 February 1745, shortly before 01:00, Weymouth grounded after having sailed from English Harbour, Antigua on 13 February. All her guns and stores were removed, before Weymouth finally broke up on 22 February. Her commanding officer, Captain Warwick Calmady, was court- martialed over the loss on 18‚Äì19 February, and acquitted.

It is in Ouachita and Union Parishes on either side of Bayou D'Arbonne near its confluence with the Ouachita River. It lies on the western edge of the Mississippi River alluvial valley. It was established in 1975 to protect bottomland hardwoods and provide wintering habitat for migratory waterfowl. D'Arbonne is one of four refuges managed in the North Louisiana Refuges Complex. Ecology D'Arbonne National Wildlife Refuge The refuge is bisected by 13 miles of Bayou D'Arbonne and is crisscrossed by numerous creeks, sloughs, and oxbow lakes. Cypress swamps and bottomland hardwood and upland forests provide several types of habitat for native plants and animals. Local species include the American alligator, Rafinesque's big-eared bat, the bald eagle, and the red-cockaded woodpecker. In years of normal or above rainfall, the refuge's bottomland hardwood forest is a very important overflow area for the Ouachita River basin. High water levels, which usually occur between January and May, can flood up to 87% of the refuge. The wetland forests not only provide habitat to wetland-dependent wildlife, but they also reduce damage from flooding in developed areas. They filter silt and pollutants from the water and they provide recharge areas for aquifers. Recreation No camping is allowed on the refuge. Camping areas can be found in nearby Lake D'Arbonne State Park.

The Trust is the successor to the Wilts & Berks Canal Amenity Group (formed in 1977) and a founder member of the Wilts & Berks Canal Partnership, which embraces the Trust, the local authorities for the areas through which the route of the canal passes, statutory bodies, and other interested parties. The Trust's headquarters are at Dauntsey Lock, adjacent to the canal between Chippenham and Royal Wootton Bassett. History The Trust originated in 1977 as the Wilts & Berks Canal Amenity Group whose remit was to protect what remained of the canal, and restore short sections for their amenity value. The first Wilts & Berks Canal Trust (W&BCT;) was formed in 1997. Wilts & Berks Canal Amenity Group was a founding member of the Trust together with North Wiltshire District Council, West Wiltshire District Council, Swindon Borough Council, Vale of the White Horse District Council, Oxfordshire County Council and Wiltshire County Council. In 1998, the Trust published a feasibility study commissioned by North Wiltshire, examining the restoration of the full route together with the North Wilts Canal. However, the structure of the Trust prevented them from applying for certain funds and grants, and it was wound up in 2001. The Trust re-emerged as a member of the Wilts & Berks Canal Partnership in 2001. In 2007, membership rose to over 2000 for the first time. The Duchess of Cornwall became patron of the trust in 2006.  Aim  To protect, conserve and improve the route of the Wilts & Berks Canal, North Wilts Canal, and branches, for the benefit of the community and environment, with the ultimate goal of restoring a continuous navigable waterway linking the Kennet and Avon Canal near Melksham, the River Thames near Abingdon, and the Thames and Severn Canal near Cricklade.

The area formed when a breach in the natural levee of the Mississippi River occurred in 1862 approximately below New Orleans, Louisiana. The refuge was purchased in 1935 with the primary purpose to provide sanctuary and habitat to wintering waterfowl. Access is by boat only. Wildlife and habitat Raccoon photographed in the Delta National Wildlife Refuge in Louisiana Delta NWR supports a wide variety of wildlife species. Tens of thousands of wintering waterfowl take advantage of the rich food resources found in the delta. Large numbers of other bird species can be found on the refuge, with numbers peaking during the spring and fall migrations. Large numbers of wading birds nest on the refuge, and thousands of shorebirds can be found on tidal mudflats and deltaic splays. Numerous furbearers and game mammals are year-round residents, and the marshes and waterways provide year-round and seasonal habitat for a diversity of fish and shellfish species. Thousands of shorebirds use the refuge as a wintering area and also as a resting and staging area during migration. Commonly observed species include greater and lesser yellowlegs, long-billed dowitchers, dunlins, western sandpipers, Wilson's plovers, killdeer and willets. Raptors are a common sight on Delta NWR. The most commonly observed species include American kestrels, northern harriers, red-tailed hawks and turkey vultures. Black vultures, Cooper's hawks, merlins, red-shouldered hawks and sharp-shinned hawks have also been seen on the refuge. Ospreys are common winter visitors to the refuge. Large numbers of passerine birds (songbirds) utilize the refuge as a resting and staging area during the spring and fall migrations. Deer are frequently observed by the refuge staff on the natural pass banks, manmade spoil banks, and the marshes associated with these features. Swamp rabbits are found over much of the refuge, and populations appear to be stable. A number offurbearing species make their homes on Delta NWR. The most abundant of these is the nutria. The marshes and waterways of the Delta NWR support a diversity of fish species. Speckled trout, redfish, flounder, blue crabs and shrimp are important saltwater species found on the refuge. Catfish, largemouth bass, and various sunfish species are found in the freshwater areas of the refuge. Delta NWR is an extremely important nursery area for both fresh and saltwater fish species. Checking oil well on Delta National Wildlife Refuge The marsh habitat on the refuge is classified as Paulustrine Emergent Wetlands. Two basic marsh zones occur within the habitat: fresh marsh nearest the main tributaries, and brackish marsh near the Gulf of Mexico. The fertile soils, vegetative composition, and shallow water wetland environment offers outstanding recreational opportunities such as fishing, wildlife observation, photography, hunting, and primitive camping. It provides protection and habitat to numerous plant and wildlife species including the following endangered and threatened species; the American alligator, brown pelican, Arctic peregrine falcon and the piping plover. Untold numbers of passerine birds \\"song birds\\" and shorebirds use the refuge as a staging area during migration periods. Waterfowl counts in excess of 400,000 ducks and geese present on the refuge during peak population periods have been recorded. The fresh marsh is located primarily on mineral soil and to a very limited extent, on flotons (i.e., floating mats of emergent vegetation). Approximately 60% of the refuge consists of the fresh marsh zone. The predominant plants are delta duck potato (Sagittaria platyphylla), elephant ear (Colocasia antiquorum), wild millet (Echinochloa crus-galli), delta three-square (Scirpus deltarum), and roseau cane (Phragmites sp.). The marsh is tidally influenced and water levels fluctuate from a few inches to a foot or more. The fertile soils, vegetative composition and shallow water environment create a highly productive habitat for fish and wildlife. Hurricane damage Delta National Wildlife Refuge took a direct hit from Hurricane Katrina. Facilities at the refuge sub- headquarters located in Venice were severely damaged. The refuge itself was also changed in many ways, as it has over the years when hurricanes and tropical storms have hit the area. Marsh and beach areas were eroded, trees were blown down or damaged, debris was washed onto the refuge and vegetation was stressed by saltwater intrusion. Several oil spills and a grounded barge impacted the refuge. Camping is no longer allowed on Delta National Wildlife Refuge. Deepwater Horizon oil spill The oil slick from the explosion of Deepwater Horizon reached the reserve. The spill was larger in size than the Exxon Valdez oil spill.

After four major exhibitions on the site (1887‚Äì1892), he moved to France where in partnership with Allen Stoneham, he developed Touquet-Paris-Plage and created Hardelot-Plage. He was a brother-in- law of pioneering French Cinematographer, Louis Aim√© Augustin Le Prince and grandfather of Air marshal Sir John Whitley.  Background  John Whitley was the eldest son of Leeds iron and bronze foundry owner, Joseph Whitley and his wife, Sarah n√©e Robinson. Joseph Whitley, originally from Wakefield, was steeped in metallurgy and moved to Leeds where in 1844 he opened his own business, J.Whitley & Co., subsequently J.Whitley Partners, which he headed until his death in 1891. He was an innovator and inventor, holder of over 50 patents. Joseph and Sarah Whitley were the parents-in-law of French pioneer cinematographer, Louis Le Prince, who, in 1888 'filmed' them along with other family members in what was probably the first ever experimental motion picture, at their home in Roundhay. See The First Film. Whitley probably attended Leeds Grammar School: the name is mentioned on the register, without an initial, around 1856. Note: His father, Joseph, is listed as a brass founder on p.113 of the same book Later his parents sent him to Germany to learn German, then on to Blois in France to master French and finally to Sienna, Italy to learn Italian. He was an alumnus of Durham University. On completing his education, he carried on with foreign travel to acquaint himself with industrial developments abroad. His tours included return visits to France, Germany and Italy and forays into Switzerland, Austria-Hungary, Russia, Turkey, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Portugal. Further excursions were to continental Africa, the United States and South America. Fluent in four languages and a graduate of several European universities, he joined his father's business in Leeds and was commissioned to expand it into Europe and the USA. From 1873 he was a member of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers.Grace's Guide to British Industrial History  Career in England  Hunslet Feast as Whitley may have witnessed Earls Court as it became in the 20th century Before entering the family business, Whitley had been attending Leipzig University in 1866 where he met a French graduate of chemistry and fine art, called Louis Le Prince. The two men became friends and Whitley invited him to Leeds that same year. The following year Le Prince joined Joseph Whitley's firm and two years later, in 1869 married his daughter, Elizabeth Sarah, herself a talented artist and designer. John Whitley's own business schemes eventually created unsustainable debt and it was agreed that he should resign and seek his own fortune abroad in 1874 when he left for France.Peter Kelley. (2002) Louis A.A. Le Prince and the Whitley Family, publisher ODHS. The birth of Earl's Court Exhibition Back in the United Kingdom in the early 1880s, John Whitley resolved to follow his dream of bringing nations together by emulating the great exhibitions of the past in Paris and London with the difference of concentrating on one industrialised country at a time. Charles Lowe characterised Whitley as follows: :a keen business faculty, a high degree of administrative skill, a daring spirit of enterprise, a personal knowledge of foreign countries and customs, great linguistic acquirements, refined perceptions in art coupled with a sense of being at home in all the fields of modern industry, a philanthropic heart, dauntless courage and an inflexible will‚Äîthese are qualities, it must surely be admitted, which rarely go to the making up of any one character, and which rendered Mr. Whitley just the very man to undertake the task of bringing home to the minds and doors of his fellow-countrymen the life of foreign nations in concrete and concentrated form. Having travelled widely in the world, he decided to capitalise on his acquaintance with the American showman, William Cody whom he had met while in the USA and create an America-focused commercial fair around the Wild West Show.The William F. Cody Archive ‚Äì Documenting the Life and Times of Buffalo Bill: John Whitley 1843‚Äì1922. http://codyarchive.org/life/wfc.person.html#whitley.j To this end he settled on the vast vacant 24 acre grounds created by the recently built railway lines and depot on the Fulham ‚Äì West Brompton border and the nearby popular sporting venue, the Lillie Bridge Grounds. His ambitious concept came to fruition in 1887 under the name of the Earl's Court Exhibition Grounds. He had managed to persuade the railway companies which owned the land ‚Äì a cabbage patch ‚Äì to earn rent from leasing their property for a profitable and laudable cause. According to Charles Lowe, the contemporary commentator on Whitley's project, the idea of a joint venture with railway companies was later reproduced by the Metropolitan railway, owners of the cuttings at Wembley Park. The many contacts Whitley had, combined with his organisational skills ensured that his popular venture was graced by the visit in her Jubilee Year, of the monarch herself, Queen Victoria.Greenhalgh, Paul. (2018) \\"Education Entertainment and Politics Lessons from the Great International Exhibitions\\" in Vergo, Peter. New Museology. Reaktion Books ‚Äì Critical Views Series. Original Publisher Reaktion Books, 1989. . p.80-81 Competing managements The exhibitions that followed the success of the America Fair and its 'Wild West Show' were not all in the hands of Whitley. He had to compete with other entrepreneurs, who like him, were none of them backed by the Government and straying occasionally into the foreign policy arena. Such was the case with the Spanish Exhibition of 1889 that Whitley had tried and failed to influence.Hooper, K., 2014. A Tale of Two Empires? The Earl's Court Spanish Exhibition (1889). Modern Languages Open, (1), DOI: http://doi.org/10.3828/mlo.v0i1.5 He put on three more country-centred shows: Italy, France, and Germany to promote their industries and cultures. However, the British public may have been sated by such spectacle and evidently did not share Whitley's international enthusiasms. They were anyway not financially successful. His last project elicited comments such as, \\"Germania\\". Although the formula was later to be successfully reinstated for two decades by Whitley's successor at Earl's Court, the Hungarian impresario, Imre Kiralfy, and subsequently from the late 1930s onwards after Howard Crane's iconic Earls Court Exhibition Hall was built in 1937 (and demolished in 2014).Glanfield, John. (2002) Earls Court and Olympia ‚Äì From Buffalo Bill to the Brits. London: Sutton Publishing The Touquet Experiment Disappointed with his London projects over five years, in 1892, Whitley was thinking of other potential opportunities. The friendship of the Prince of Wales with members of the French government suggested an Entente Cordiale between France and the United Kingdom could be propitious for an enterprise over the Channel. Whitley began to search for a site on the Northern French coast between Saint-Valery-sur-Somme and Boulogne-sur-Mer. Although he happened on Fort-Mahon he quickly diverted his attention to a more interesting proposition between Berck and Canche, with an attractive forest and the newly created resort of Paris-Plage, with already 350 buildings, 3 hotels and a church. When he arrived in Le Touquet-Paris-Plage in 1894 the landowners, the Daloz family, were not ready to sell up. He therefore decided to buy a two kilometre stretch of coastline, 500 metres deep, south of Paris- Plage, with a view to creating there a new Anglo-French resort called Mayville in honour of Princess Mary of Teck. In 1895 he started the \\"Mayville Company Ltd\\", with a 50 strong syndicate of shareholders that numbered Louis Pasteur, Sarah Bernhardt and the second Duke of Morny among its members. He remained in Le Touquet till 1905.  The Hardelot development Following differences in the Le Touquet community, over the routing of the new railway and other disputes especially with his erstwhile partner, Stoneham, he left Le Touquet- Paris-Plage in 1905 and concentrated on the neighbouring resort of Hardelot- Plage, where he was the owner of the chateau since 1897. He died of a heart attack in his Chateau in Condette in the current rue John-Whitley, formerly rue du Choquel, on 21 March 1922. He is buried at Condette.

Before independence, Iceland had been an independent part of the Kingdom of Denmark since 1918. Fearing an Axis move against Iceland following the Nazi Occupation of Denmark, British forces landed on Iceland in 1940. On 17 June 1944, 200 days after the 25 year Danish‚ÄìIcelandic Act of Union had expired and following a referendum, Iceland was declared an independent republic with this being recognised by London as well as the King of Denmark. From Iceland's independence until the mid-1970s, bilateral relations were difficult due to the 'Cod Wars' (a series of disputes over fishing rights in the 1950s and 1970s). Since then relations are much better, mainly because both countries have common interests including free trade, defence, environmental protection and international peace. Both countries are members of NATO and the European Economic Area. Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom paid a state visit to Iceland in June 1990. In October 2015, David Cameron became the first UK Prime Minister to officially visit Iceland (to attend the Northern Future Forum) since it became a republic in 1944. The last UK PM to visit the territory had been Winston Churchill, in August 1941. The United Kingdom has an embassy in Reykjav√≠k. Iceland has an embassy in London and seventeen honorary consulates in: Aberdeen, Birmingham, Cardiff, Dover, East Riding of Yorkshire, Edinburgh, Fleetwood, Glasgow, Grimsby, Guernsey, Jersey (in the Channel Islands), Lerwick, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Northern Ireland, and York. Disputes past and present Second World War During the Second World War in 1940 following the fall of Denmark the United Kingdom launched the Invasion of Iceland and occupied Icelandic territory until 1941 when defence responsibility was transferred to the United States of America. Cod Wars The Cod Wars were a series of confrontations in the 1950s and 1970s between the United Kingdom and Iceland regarding fishing rights in the North Atlantic. In February 1976 Iceland severed diplomatic ties with Britain, an unprecedented action between two NATO members, which were restored in the spring of that year. Rockall Rockall was claimed by a number of nations, including Iceland and the United Kingdom, as well as by the Republic of Ireland and Denmark (on behalf of the Faroe Islands). The United Kingdom and Ireland reached a power sharing agreement over Rockall, but as yet no other agreements exist with Iceland or Denmark. Icesave dispute The Icesave dispute was a dispute between Iceland and the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands over frozen assets held by collapsed Icelandic banks which operated in the above countries, causing much political tension. Mackerel row In recent years, mackerel migration and spawning has taken place into both Faroese and Icelandic waters and since then the quota Iceland has allocated to itself has risen to a 130,000-ton quota. This has led to tensions between the Icelandic government and those of the United Kingdom, Norway and Ireland. The European Union and Norway awarded themselves 90% of the TAC in 2011, despite Icelandic and Faroese objections. Scientific investigations concluded that the TAC of mackerel should be 646,000 tons, of which the EU and Norway awarded themselves 583,882 tons, leaving only 62,118 tons for the Faroe Islands and Iceland. This debate has led to speculation of a future cod war. Diplomatic missions The Embassy of Iceland in London is located on Hans Street in Kensington.

Blaenrhondda is a village and is part of the community of Treherbert. History The earliest evidence of people inhabiting the area are the remains of an Iron Age settlement of several roundhouses grouped together in an obvious community, known as Hen Dre'r Mynydd. The dry wall layout of the ruinous site has led archaeologists to believe that the people who lived in the area were early farmers.BBC website - Celtic Heritage It has been identified as the largest undefended Iron Age settlement in south east Wales. Before the industrialisation of the Rhondda Valleys in the late 19th century, Blaenrhondda was an agricultural area and sparsely populated. With the coming of the coal industry two mines were sunk in the locality. The first was the North Dunraven, also known as the Blaenrhondda, sunk in 1859, followed by Fernhill Colliery around 1871. The Dunraven closed in the 1920s but the Fernhill was still operating as late as 1978. In an attempt to break the monopoly of the Taff Vale Railway and the Cardiff docks, a tunnel was constructed through Mynydd Blaengwynfy to link up with the Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway to supply coal to the Swansea Docks for export. The resulting tunnel, at a length of 3,300 yards was the longest rail tunnel in Wales and the seventh longest in Britain. Due to an issue with the weight the engines could pull, the rail link was never the success it was hoped to be, though it did prove popular with day-trippers from the Rhondda, visiting Swansea and the Gower.

The Dover books In DCI Wilfred Dover and his assistant Sergeant MacGregor, she created a template later used successfully, especially by Reginald Hill, in straight 'whodunnits', but Porter's novels, while intricately plotted, were always played for laughs. But despite their light- hearted nature, Porter allowed the books to reflect topical themes. Dover is obese, lazy, unhygienic and bordering on corrupt. MacGregor is keen, clean and ferociously ambitious. However, on the rare occasions he is able to put aside plate, pint-glass and cigarettes long enough to concentrate, Dover usually sees the answer first. The Honourable Constance books The Honourable Constance Ethel Morrison-Burke is an upper-class 'spinster' who, armed only with pluck, a deep-rooted hatred of men and her family's enormous financial resources, sallies forth to fight crime with the aid of her devoted companion Miss Jones. (In The Fine Art of Murder, editors Ed Gorman et al. describe Morrison-Burke as \\"the first clearly lesbian detective in fiction.\\") The 'Hon Con' books were even less like straight 'who-dunnits' than the 'Dovers' because while Dover is an experienced copper who has, it becomes clear, a good brain, the 'Hon Con' is an amateur bungler of below-average intelligence. Therefore, her solving of each case had to be achieved entirely by a happy coincidence.

It is an art form in which either a sculpture produces light, or light is used to create a \\"sculpture\\" through the manipulation of light, colours, and shadows. These sculptures can be temporary or permanent, and can exist in two distinctive spaces: indoor galleries, such as museum exhibits, or outdoors at events like festivals. Light art can be an interaction of light within an architectural space. Light artists are those that devote all their creative experimentation to light art, some artists experiment with light and neon signage and use light in their practice. History Robert Irwin Scrim Veil‚ÄîBlack Rectangle‚ÄîNatural Light, Whitney Museum of American Art Interior of Santa Maria Annunciata in Chiesa Rossa. Milan, Italy. Projection mapping (San Francisco) The first examples of modern light art appeared after the discovery of electric lighting made longterm lighting safe and affordable at the end of the 19th century. Light art however didn't become a dedicated form of art until the late 20th century, due in large part due to pioneering work begun in 1969, as part of an experimental program at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, by Robert Irwin and James Turrell.Glenn Shrum, Light Art Matters - A closer look at the ideas behind the work Modernism, Constructivism and the Bauhaus (1920‚Äì1935) Light has been used for architectural effect throughout human history. However, the modern concept of light art emerged with the development of artificial electric incandescent light sources and experimentation by modern artists of the Constructivist and Bauhaus movements. \\"Prounenraum (Proun Room) (1923), by El Lissitzky, is considered by many art historians to be the first time an artist incorporated architectural lighting elements as a component integral to his work.\\" The first object-based light sculpture was the Light- Space Modulator (1922-1930), by L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy. Experimentation and innovations in theatrical light have often influenced other areas of light use such as light art. The development of Modernism and the electric light go hand-in-hand; the idea of the modern city with high-rises and electric light epitomizes this development. All visual art uses light in some form, but in modern photography and motion pictures, use of light is especially important. However, with the invention of electrical artificial light, possibilities expanded and many artists began using light as the main form of expression, rather than solely as a vehicle for other forms of art. Constructivist Naum Gabo experimented with the transparent materiality light reflects on an object; his Linear Construction No. 1 (1943) provides an example of this. Marcel Duchamp's Hat Rack (1916 and 1964), hangs from the ceiling and casts a shadow against the wall. Large-scale displays of light require the collaboration of the authorities. An early example is the utilization of the majority of the searchlights of the German Air Force by Albert Speer for his Cathedral of Light, an impressive feature of the Nazi Party rallies at Nuremberg between 1934 an d1938. Art critic Hilarie M. Sheets explains that \\"the interplay of dark and light has been a theme running from Greek and Roman sculpture to Renaissance painting to experimental film. But as technology advanced from the glow of the electric light bulb to the computer monitor, artists have been experimenting with actual light as material and subject.\\"Sheets, Hilarie M. \\"Waves of Light.\\" ARTnews Mar. 2007: 131-33. ARTnews. Print. Web. 1 Feb. 2012. http://www.artnews.com/2007/03/01/waves-of- light/. Lumino kinetic and op art (1950‚Äì1970) Minimalism Neon art (1980s) Projection mapping Closely associated art forms are projectors, 3-D map projection, multi-media, video art, and photography where light technology projects images rather than using light as the medium. Large light festivals and events have helped to develop the use of light on large canvases such as architectural facades, building projections, the flood lighting of buildings with colour, and interactive media facades. These forms of light art have their antecedents in new media-based, video art and photography which are sometimes classified as light art since light and movement are important to the work. Digital graffiti Also included in the light art genre is the so-called light graffiti including projection onto buildings, arrangement of lighted windows in buildings, and painting with hand-held lights onto film using time exposure. Light painting Lightpainting  Light Art Installation  An example of a light art installation was that of artists Mel and Dorothy Tanner, who began adding light to their paintings and sculptures at their studio in Miami, Florida, in 1967. This was the same time period as that of Light and Space artists James Turrell and Robert Irwin in Los Angeles, on the opposite U.S. coast. The Tanners worked very closely for over 40 years until Mel Tanner died in 1993. Their main project was the creation of Lumonics that consists of their light sculptures, live projection, video, electronics and music as a total art installation. Author and art historian, Michael Betancourt described this conceptual art as a Gesamtkunstwerk in his book, The Lumonics Theater: The Art of Mel & Dorothy Tanner, published in 2004. Dorothy Tanner, born in 1923, continues her light art from her studio in Denver, and co-directs the Lumonics School of Light Art with Marc Billard.

Museums Many modern art museums include light sculptures and installations in their permanent and temporary collections. The Centre for International Light Art in Unna, Germany is currently the world's only museum dedicated exclusively to the collection and presentation of light art. The Light Art Museum in Eindhoven, Netherlands, another museum dedicated to the display of light art, closed on 5 December 2010. due to insufficient funding, but at the Strijp-S complex, one can see the Fakkel by Har Hollands, Daan Roosegaarde's Crystal as well as part of the light festival GLOW.'Herbeleef Glow Eindhoven: Routes en hoogtepunten door de jaren heen', Eindhovens Dagblad.'Licht zien, voelen en zelfs opslaan op Glow Next', Eindhovens Dagblad. Many well-known art museums, such as the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, often have temporary light art exhibits and installations in their galleries. Light festivals Light festivals and the smart city LED revolution was driven by outdoor urban light sculpture with low energy LED luminaires. Light artists were able to create new exhibition spaces collectively in the form of light art festivals. These festivals have continued to grow internationally and help to highlight ecological change. This LED low energy movement dates back to the 2009 by the Vivid Smart Light Festival in Sydney. In Singapore, the i Light Marina Bay festival‚ÄîAsia's only sustainable light festival‚Äîwas first hosted in 2010. There are many light art festivals, especially in Europe, including the Signal Festival in Prague and the Ghent Light Festival. Light festivals and LEDS have redefined light art as an art genre.\\"SuperLux: Smart Light Art, Design & Architecture for Cities\\" published by Thames and Hudson Author Davina Jackson Light Art Awards The World Light Art Award, presented by the Centre for International Light Art Unna and the RWE Foundation, is given to up-and-coming artists who will contribute \\"to the development of light art in an innovative and creative way\\" and has been in existence since 2015. The award is meant to encourage artists to explore light art, despite the difficulties the relatively new style faces, including the financial and technical requirements needed for a light art exhibit. The foundations behind the ILAA also wish to put emphasis on sustainability and new technologies within the medium of light expression. The Australian and New Zealand Engineering Illumination Society ANZIES began giving an annual award to light artists at the Vivid Light Festival in 2010. Vivid Light festival grants help support local and international light artists in the pursuit of their medium. 2015 The DARC awards, supported by Mondo Arc Magazine, began selecting winners for their light art awards.

A structured document with Content, sections and subsections for explanations of sentences forms a NLP document, which is actually a computer program. Natural languages and natural-language user interfaces include Inform 7, a natural programming language for making interactive fiction, Shakespeare, an esoteric natural programming language in the style of the plays of William Shakespeare, and Wolfram Alpha, a computational knowledge engine, using natural-language input. Some methods for program synthesis are based on natural-language programming.Desai, Aditya, et al. \\"Program synthesis using natural language.\\" Proceedings of the 38th International Conference on Software Engineering. ACM, 2016. Interpretation The smallest unit of statement in NLP is a sentence. Each sentence is stated in terms of concepts from the underlying ontology, attributes in that ontology and named objects in capital letters. In an NLP text every sentence unambiguously compiles into a procedure call in the underlying high-level programming language such as MATLAB, Octave, SciLab, Python, etc. Symbolic languages such as Wolfram Language are capable of interpreted processing of queries by sentences. This can allow interactive requests such as that implemented in Wolfram Alpha.Wolfram Alpha how it works (part 2) Computer Weekly, 4 June 2009 Wolfram Alpha computes answers Tech Crunch, 8 March 2009 The difference between these and NLP is that the latter builds up a single program or a library of routines that are programmed through natural language sentences using an ontology that defines the available data structures in a high level programming language. An example text from an English language natural-language program is as follows: > If U_ is 'smc01-control', then do the following. Define surface weights > Alpha as \\"[0.5, 0.5]\\". Initialise matrix Phi as a 'unit matrix'. Define J as > the 'inertia matrix' of Spc01. Compute matrix J2 as the inverse of J. > Compute position velocity error Ve and angular velocity error Oe from > dynamical state X, guidance reference Xnow. Define the joint sliding surface > G2 from the position velocity error Ve and angular velocity error Oe using > the surface weights Alpha. Compute the smoothed sign function SG2 from the > joint sliding surface G2 with sign threshold 0.01. Compute special dynamical > force F from dynamical state X and surface weights Alpha. Compute control > torque T and control force U from matrix J2, surface weights Alpha, special > dynamical force F, smoothed sign function SG2. Finish conditional actions. that defines a feedback control scheme using a sliding mode control method. Software paradigm Natural-language programming is a top-down method of writing software. Its stages are as follows: * Definition of an ontology taxonomy of concepts needed to describe tasks in the topic addressed. Each concept and all their attributes are defined in natural-language words. This ontology will define the data structures the NLP can use in sentences. * Definition of one or more top-level sentences in terms of concepts from the ontology. These sentences are later used to invoke the most important activities in the topic. * Defining of each of the top-level sentences in terms of a sequence of sentences. * Defining each of the lower-level sentences in terms of other sentences or by a simple sentence of the form Execute code \\"...\\". where ... stands for a code in terms of the associated high-level programming language. * Repeating the previous step until you have no sentences left undefined. During this process each of sentences can be classified to belong to a section of the document to be produced in HTML or Latex format to form the final natural-language program. * Testing the meaning of each sentence by executing its code using testing objects. * Providing a library of procedure calls (in the underlying high-level language) which are needed in the code definitions of some low-level-sentence meanings. * Providing a title, author data and compiling the sentences into an HTML or LaTex file. * Publishing the natural-language program as a webpage on the Internet or as a PDF file compiled from the LaTex document. Publication value of natural-language programs and documents A natural-language program is a precise formal description of some procedure that its author created. It is human readable and it can also be read by a suitable software agent. For example, a web page in an NLP format can be read by a software personal assistant agent to a person and she or he can ask the agent to execute some sentences, i.e. carry out some task or answer a question. There is a reader agent available for English interpretation of HTML based NLP documents that a person can run on her personal computer . Contribution of natural-language programs to machine knowledge An ontology class in a natural-language program that is not a concept in the sense as humans use concepts. Concepts in an NLP are examples (samples) of generic human concepts. Each sentence in a natural-language program is either (1) stating a relationship in a world model or (2) carries out an action in the environment or (3) carries out a computational procedure or (4) invokes an answering mechanism in response to a question. A set of NLP sentences, with associated ontology defined, can also be used as a pseudo code that does not provide the details in any underlying high level programming language. In such an application the sentences used become high level abstractions (conceptualisations) of computing procedures that are computer language and machine independent.

Augusta was active in the Caribbean during the Seven Years' War. Arthur Forrest became the ship's commander in 1757. On 23 December 1757 she sighted an armed 9-ship French convoy off of Haiti, which was disguised under neutral Dutch flags. The convoy, led by the 32-gun Le Mars, wrongly assumed Augusta was a Dutch warship. Forrest fired a broadside at Le Mars that resulted in the ship's surrender, as well was the capitulation of the entire convoy. Forrest and Augusta captured the 400-ton French ship Pallas after a 5-day chase in October 1758. The prize, laden with oil, wine, and other goods, was valued at over two million livres. Augusta served until 1765, when she was broken up. This British ship served as the inspiration to Danish shipbuilder Andreas Gerner in designing the 50-gun ship-of-the-line .

It was published by The Mystery League, Inc. Though little remembered today, it did well enough in its own time for Hollywood to adapt it into a feature film, 1934's The Ninth Guest (which name would also be utilized for subsequent editions of the book).The 9th Guest (1934) imdb.com Before its cinematic adaptation Pulitzer Prize winning dramatist Owen Davis had adapted it for a 1930 Broadway play with the same name as the subsequent film (The Ninth Guest). It could be considered an example of the \\"old dark house\\" type of thriller. It has been noted that Agatha Christie's much more famous tale, 1939's Ten Little Indians, bears striking similarities to this novel. Predating Christie's text by almost a decade, The Invisible Host tells the story of eight people who are summoned to a deserted, well-appointed New Orleans penthouse by an anonymous invitation. There is no evidence Agatha Christie saw either the play (which had a brief run on Broadway from August to October 1930The Ninth Guest ibdb.com) or the 1934 film. Once at the penthouse the guests, who are all known to each other, are served a superb dinner. Shortly thereafter, they are accused by a voice over the radio that they are all going to die before the night is out. The unseen host has meticulously prepared the demise of each guest, and has booby- trapped the penthouse to prevent anyone from escaping. As they steadily succumb to the murderer's devices, some begin to suspect that the killer may be one of them.

It is also reportedly naturalized in South Africa, Italy and Spain, specially in the Canary Islands.Salm-Reifferscheid-Dyck, Joseph Franz Maria Anton Hubert. Bonplandia 7: 88. 1859.Howard Scott Gentry, Agaves of Continental North America (University of Arizona Press, 1982) pp. 183-1850 This species, also called Agave of Salm or Salm-Dick, is dedicated to the German prince and botanist Joseph zu Salm-Reifferscheidt-Dyck (1773-1861).  Description  A. salmiana var. ferox flowering in Germany A. salmiana presents a spiral- shaped rosette with large flared and erect leaves. These leaves are thick, dark green with a large point at the tip and strong spines on the edges. When a leaf has unfolded, it leaves an imprint on the leaf underneath. Like most agaves, the species is monocarpic, that is to say it only flowers once and then dies. This flowering occurs after 15 to 25 years producing a vertical floral stem, typically up to long and bearing greenish-yellow flowers. The largest specimens have been significantly taller. One specimen growing at the Strawberry Canyon Botanical Garden on the campus of U. C. Berkeley, Berkeley, California in 1974 produced an inflorescence with a total height of 52 feet (16 m) of which the scape or peduncle was about 39' 4\\" (12 m) and the panicle per se was 13 feet (4 m).Norris and Ross McWhirter, GUINNESS BOOK OF WORLD RECORDS (New York: Sterling Pub. Co., 1989 edit.) p. 75. And a letter from Bruce Bartholomew, Curator of the Strawberry Canyon Botanic Garden. Hermann J.H. Jacobsen states that the inflorescence of A. salmiana has reached an overall height of 62 feet (19 m),Hermann Jacobsen, HANDBOOK OF SUCCULENT PLANTS (London: Blandford Press, 1960) Vol. 1 p. 118. making the inflorescence of A. salmiana the tallest of any known species of plant. Old plants reach 1.8 m in height and the leaves form a rosette 3.6 m in diameter. The variety A. salmiana var. ferox (K.Koch) Gentry is often encountered in cultivation. The epithet ferox is due to the hard and long (up to 8 cm) spines.  Distribution  Originally from southern and central Mexico, it was introduced into gardens with a Mediterranean climate in Europe and sometimes escaped into the wild, thus becoming naturalised in some parts of southern Europe.  Cultivation  Cultivation is easy in a well-drained sandy soil with sunny exposure. For a pot culture, it requires a container of very large size to remain in an harmonious appearance. It can be used to stabilise a slope. It can withstand a light frost if it is completely dry. It is multiplied more easily by planting shoots than by seedlings.

It is owned by Deutsche Bahn and has specialised in the maintenance of museum steam locomotives since 1990, having extensive experience in maintaining steam engines. Today, customers of the factory include railway museums and museum railways from all over Europe. The factory is responsible for the safety inspections of all operational German steam locomotives. Dampflokwerk Meiningen is the only facility in Europe capable of constructing new locomotive boilers up to modern standards of construction, performance, and safety. The newly built British steam locomotive 60163 Tornado that was delivered in 2008 had her all-steel, high-performance boiler made at Meiningen; the only part that could not be made in Britain. History View of the factory In 1863 the Werra Railway (Werrabahn) built a locomotive repair shop opposite Meiningen station, which became a main workshop for the Prussian state railways in 1902. In 1910, construction of a new building on the present site was begun due to the lack of space at the original location. On 2 March 1914, the workshop was opened with 420 employees. From that time to the present day it has carried out the repair and maintenance of steam locomotives of all types. By 1918 the number of employees had risen to 2,200. From 1919 onwards, the shop was operated by the Deutsche Reichsbahn. After the foundation of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft in 1924, it was renamed the 'Meiningen Reichsbahn Repair Depot' (Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Meiningen or RAW Meiningen). From 1925 the new Einheitsdampflokomotiven were repaired and inspected too, mainly those of classes 01, 02, 43 and 44. In the 1930s an average of 60 locomotives a month were repaired; during the Second World War this rose to 87 per month. On 18 April 1945 the factory was occupied by the United States Army and on 21 April around 400 employees began work again. By the end of 1946 the number of workers had risen to just under 3,000. In 1951 nine employees lost their lives when there was a boiler explosion on a DRG Class 95 locomotive in the boiler testing shop (Anheizhaus); a passer-by in a nearby street was also killed. The boiler landed in the garden of the neighbouring hospital. In the 1960s, construction began on new snow ploughs for the DR in East Germany as well as the conversion of steam locomotives to oil-firing. At the same time the refurbishment of diesel locomotives was taken on. The number of employees hovered around 2,000. In 1961 the former streamliner, 61 002, was converted by the factory into the high-speed, trial locomotive, 18 201, which is still operational today. This engine reached a top speed of 180 km/h and is currently the fastest, operational steam locomotive in the world. In 1981 the construction of fireless locomotives and S-Bahn bogies began, whilst the repair of steam locomotives steadily waned. After the merger of the DB and DR in 1994 into the Deutsche Bahn AG, there was a drastic cutback in the workforce. Today there are only 120 men in the factory. Since 1995, under the name of Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works (Dampflokwerk Meiningen), the factory has become a European specialist for the refurbishment of steam locomotives of all classes, the customer base of which includes railway companies as well as technical museums and railway heritage societies. In 1995 a major project was begun for a private investor. The former monument locomotive, ex-DB 012 102-4 (oil) from Bebra, now streamlined steam locomotive number 01 1102, also known as the \\"Blue-Lady‚Äú, was completely overhauled from 1994‚Äì96 and delivered to the owner, Johannes Klings, on 1 March 1996. It is a piece of history and, at the same time, an example of the quality and construction capability of the ex DR repair shop and the present day steam locomotive works. In 2002, locomotive 18 201 which the workshop had rebuilt, was completely overhauled again and transferred to its new owner Dampf-Plus. Today the steam locomotive works is a centre of attraction for steam locomotive enthusiasts. In June 2006 the new boiler for the 60163 Tornado locomotive was delivered. Tornado is a new British steam locomotive built to the same plans as those of the LNER Class A1 ('Peppercorn') series from the immediate post-war years, and noted for its distinctive conical shape. From April to October 2007 the ADLER, a 1935 replica of the first German steam locomotive, was rebuilt in Meiningen after it had been badly damaged by the fire at the Nuremberg Transport Museum's roundhouse at Nuremberg West locomotive depot on 17 October 2005.

The Weigh House, Cumberland Market, c. 1914. Cumberland Market was a London market between Regent's Park and Euston railway station. It was built in the early 19th century and was London's hay and straw market for a hundred years until the late 1920s. An arm of the Regent's Canal was built to the market. The market was surrounded by modest housing, and in the early 20th century became an artistic community. The original houses were demolished during and after the Second World War and it is now a housing estate, known as Regent's Park Estate. Origins The land to the east of John Nash's Regent's Park development had originally been laid out as a service district with small houses for tradesmen and three large squares intended for the marketing of hay, vegetables and meat.,Much of this has been taken from \\"Straws from Cumberland Market\\" by Patrick Baty in the catalogue for \\"A Countryman in Town: Robert Bevan and the Cumberland Market Group\\" at Southampton City Art Gallery. The exhibition ran from 26 September to 14 December 2008 before moving to Abbot Hall Art Gallery in Kendal from 13 January to 21 March 2009.Ann Saunders. Regent's Park. A Study of the Development of the Area from 1086 to the Present Day. David & Charles. 1969. p.83. Only Cumberland Market, the northernmost square survived as a commercial area. London's hay market relocated here from the Haymarket (near Piccadilly Circus) in 1830 although it was never to prove a great success, being described in 1878 as \\"never [having] been very largely attended\\".Edward Walford. Old and New London. 1878. p.299. The Regent's Canal was developed as a means of delivering goods into the North of London. It linked the Grand Junction Canal's Paddington Arm with the River Thames at Limehouse.Malcolm Holmes. Euston & Regent's Park 1870. Old Ordnance Survey Maps. Sheet 49. Consett. Alan Godfrey. 2000. The Cumberland Arm was built as a spur off it and led between Nash's Park Village West and Park Village East to the Cumberland Basin which was lined by a collection of wharfs and warehouses. Hay and straw were brought in for sale at the Market and for the nearby Albany Street cavalry barracks.The canal was also used to take away manure. Barges, each capable of carrying thirty tons, would also arrive with heavy goods such as stone and lime for building; coal and timber for the neighbouring coach-building and furniture trade. Ice, too, was brought in for the ice-merchant, William Leftwich, who had an icehouse that was eighty-two feet deep and with a capacity of 1,500 tons under the Market.This was replaced by a ship constantly engaged in bringing ice from Norway to the Thames, where it was transferred to Regent's Canal barges. This was eventually filled in with clay from the work on the Cockfosters underground railway extension in the early 1930s. Vegetables and cattle were carried in as well, thus reducing the need for the latter to be driven into the city. Clarence Market, the next square to the south, was intended to be a centre for the distribution of fresh vegetables brought in from the market gardens of Middlesex. It was later cultivated as a nursery garden and became Clarence Gardens.John Summerson. Georgian London. Pleiades Books. 1945. p.167. The houses in Clarence and Cumberland Markets were modest and the work of speculative builders who put up \\"run-of-the-mill products without the slightest obligation to make architecture.\\"John Summerson. The Life and Works of John Nash Architect. George Allen & Unwin. 1980. p.128. The southernmost square began as York Market but it never found use as a trading place and the name was later changed to Munster Square. Although its houses were tiny, with a single window on each of their three storeys, they were well-designed and perfectly proportioned.See photograph of 1936 in Michael Mansbridge. John Nash. A Complete Catalogue. Phaidon. 1991. p.183. In the NW corner of Cumberland Market, in Albany Street, John Nash had built the Ophthalmic Hospital for Sir William Adams, George IV's oculist. For several years Adams gave his services free to soldiers whose eyesight had been affected in the military campaigns in Egypt. The hospital was closed in 1822 and for a time it was used as a factory for manufacturing Bacon's and Perkin's 'steam guns'. In 1826 it was purchased by Sir Goldsworthy Gurney for the construction of his famed 'steam carriages', one of which made the journey from London to Bath and back, in July 1829. However, unable to market these vehicles Gurney was forced to sell the premises in 1832. Bought by Sir Felix Booth, the gin distiller the building survived as a landmark, although badly bombed, until demolition in 1968. Park Village East from the Cumberland Arm. From an original study by Thomas Hosmer Shepherd (1793‚Äì1864), pub 1831. Produced from Shepherd's series \\"Metropolitan Improvements; or London in the Nineteenth Century\\". Beside the Ophthalmic Hospital was Christ Church (now St. George's Cathedral), built by Nash's assistant, Sir James Pennethorne in 1837 to serve the largely working class district.The church was built in a severe Greek Revival style and is now St. George's Greek Orthodox Cathedral. George Orwell's funeral was held here in 1950. However, a series of later alterations gradually made the church more appropriate for high-church worship, and in time the windows were filled with stained glass, including a panel by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, whose family worshipped there.Geoffrey Tyack. Sir James Pennethorne and the making of Victorian London. Cambridge University Press. 1992. pp.35-36. The steeple of Christ Church, dominated Cumberland Market as did the nearby chimney of William Grimble's gin distillery, also in Albany Street. In 1840 Grimble decided to embark on producing vinegar from spirit left over from the distilling process. He went into partnership with Sir Felix Booth, and they set up premises in the North East corner of the Market. The venture was unsuccessful so they turned to the more conventional method of vinegar brewing. The brewery burnt down in 1864 and was rebuilt and extended soon after.http://www.archives.gla.ac.uk/sba/sbacolls/g.html . Growth of Railways The growth of the railway network and the opening of Euston Station in 1837 caused enormous upheaval and was one of the factors that led to the rapid decline of the area. Bringing in \\"noise, dirt, Irish navvies, and semi- itinerant railway workers\\"Matthew Sturgis. Walter Sickert. A Life. Harper Collins. 2005. p.221. Charles Dickens likened the railway works cutting their way through Camden Town to a \\"great earthquake\\".Charles Dickens. Dombey and Son. 1848. Chapter 6. More industry developed in the area than was originally planned as factories began to spring up near the canal and railway and this put even more pressure on land for housing. Houses that were originally built for middle-class families were taken over by incomers. The terraces of Mornington Crescent and Arlington Road, for example, were ideal for multi occupation for as many as nine or ten people could be accommodated in each.John Yeates. NW1. The Camden Town Artists. Heale Gallery. 2007. p.8. By 1852 the Midland Railway was transporting around a fifth of the total coal to London through both Euston and King's Cross. Ironically the canal proved useful in the construction of both King's Cross and St Pancras in terms of getting the building materials to the site. Although still in use the Regent's Canal carried less and less until by the 1850s the Cumberland Basin was described as \\"no better than a stagnant putrid ditch\\".'The Cholera'. The Medical Times and Gazette. New Series, Volume Seven. 2 July ‚Äì 31 December 1853. p.429. In 1847 Pickfords transferred their entire freight business from the canals to the railways. Cholera spread through the families of men who were employed on the barges and in the wharves around it and took hold in the overcrowded neighbourhood. The housing situation was to become worse in the following decade. Some 4,000 houses were demolished in the area to the east of Cumberland Market to make way for the new St Pancras Station in 1868. As many as 32,000 people were displaced, most with no form of compensation.Steven P. Swensen. Mapping Poverty in Agar Town: Economic Conditions Prior to the Development of St. Pancras Station in 1866. LSE. June 2006 (p.10) quoting \\"Working Man\\", II (8 Sept. 1866), pp.110-11. By the late nineteenth century a dramatic social divide had developed in this part of London with Cumberland Market in the middle. Just over one hundred metres to the west were the wealthy occupants of Nash's Chester Terrace while a short distance to the east were areas characterised by Charles Booth, the social commentator, as being occupied by the very poor, of those in \\"chronic want\\". Throughout its existence the hay market operated for three days a week alongside a general produce market. The central cobbled market place, enclosed by cast-iron posts linked with chains, was surrounded by modest houses of varying styles. Most of the houses were of three storeys, some with a basement. Although originally they do not appear to have had shops the lower floors of many were subsequently converted to business.Survey of London 1949, p.143. Twenty-one separate businesses are recorded in Cumberland Market at the beginning of the twentieth century together with four pubs. The canal had proved to be a very efficient means of bringing in stone to the Cumberland Basin and a number of monumental masonry and statuary businesses had sprung up in the Euston Road to take advantage of this. Artistic community As well as monumental statuary the availability of stone, combined with cheap rents and its proximity to the centre of town had attracted a number of sculptors and artists to set up studios in the Cumberland Market area. Amongst the former were Mario Raggi; John Henry Foley and Sir Thomas Brock.Raggi is perhaps best known for his statue of William Gladstone in Albert Square, Manchester. Sir Frederic (later Lord) Leighton also had his sculptor's studio in Osnaburgh Street. Walter Sickert in 1884. Fred Winter, the treasurer of the New English Art Club, sculpted at No.13 Robert Street and Walter Sickert painted in the next door studio in 1894 sharing it for a while with his former master Whistler. Some years later C.R.W. Nevinson rented the same studio and it was there that he painted his works for his second exhibition of War Paintings at the Leicester Galleries of 1918.C.R.W. Nevinson. Paint and Prejudice. Methuen. 1937. p. 106. In 1909-10 Sickert had taken a studio at No. 21 Augustus Street, which he called the \\"Vinegar Factory\\" as it had been part of Grimble's Factory.Matthew Sturgis. Walter Sickert. A Life. Harper Collins. 2005. p. 402 Here he taught etching. His Cumberland Market painting of ca. 1910 which was made at the south end of Augustus Street shows the side window of Charles Chase's bakers shop at No. 24 Cumberland Market.Now in the Art Gallery of Ontario, Canada. Today Cumberland Market is best remembered as the home of Robert Bevan's Cumberland Market Group for it was in his first floor studio of No. 49 that he and his colleagues held their Saturday afternoon \\"At Homes\\" in the early days of the First World War. The artist William Roberts also worked in the Market at this time and mentioned other neighbours as having been Bernard Meninsky, John Flanagan, Colin Gill, and Geoffrey Nelson.\\"William Roberts and Vorticism's Year\\" in William Roberts, Five Posthumous Essays and Other Writings. Valencia. 1990. In her \\"The Hay-Market\\" of 1914 Charlotte Mew, the poet, gave a vivid picture of Cumberland Market and its residents. Her account of a woman walking across it with her young daughter might almost have been a description of one of Bevan's better-known paintings of this period.\\"The Hay- Market.\\" The New Statesman, 14 February 1914. pp. 595-597. Compare this with Robert Bevan's Cumberland Market. Another writer attracted to the area was the American \\"Tramp Poet\\" Harry Kemp, who rented two rooms in the Market in late 1913.William Brevda. Harry Kemp: The Last Bohemian. Bucknell University Press. 1986. p. 94. It was there one morning, woken from an absinthe-induced hangover, by the tap-tapping of a blind man in the Market below that he wrote \\"Blind\\". Social Conditions A few years beforehand, concerned by the poor conditions in which many were living Mary Neal, a philanthropist, set out to help girls working in the dressmaking trade. With Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence she established the Esp√©rance Girls' Club at No. 50 Cumberland Market. This was open nearly every night of the week from 8 to 10 o'clock. One evening every week was set apart for a singing class, another for musical drill, another for games, or sewing or cooking.Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence. \\"Working Girls' Clubs\\" in W. Reason (ed.) University and Social Settlements. Methuen. 1898. p.104. Having heard of Cecil Sharp's collection of folk songs in 1905 she asked him for suitable ones that might be taught to the girls. This proved to be such a success that he was asked to recommend dances to go with the songs. Within a short time the Esp√©rance girls were putting on demonstrations around the country.Janet Dowling. \\"Revival of Morris dance in early twentieth century\\". Morris Federation Newsletter. Summer 2007. pp.17-19. Sharp collaborated with Herbert MacIlwaine, the musical director of the club, to produce the first of the Morris books. Mary Neal had been an early supporter of the Women's Social and Political Union and the Esp√©rance Club danced at many of their events. This proved to be one of the reasons for Sharp and Neal to fall out and although she went on to publish two Esp√©rance Morris books, the Club closed during the First World War. The theme of social change remained strong in Cumberland Market, for in 1916 Miss M.M. Jeffery, who had been the reformer Octavia Hill's secretary, took over three rooms at No. 42. She had been appointed to manage the Cumberland Market (London) Estate of the Commissioners of Crown Lands (later the Crown Estate Commissioners). This was an estate 'of about 850 houses divided into about 2,000 tenancies, occupied by a population of about 7,000'.Marion Brion. Women in the Housing Service. Routledge. 1995. Decline A market continued on the site right up until the late 1920s, and the last trading barges ceased sometime in 1930. Local businesses were in terminal decline and by 1931 only five remained and the King's Head was the sole surviving pub. In the same year the buildings on the north side of the Market were demolished, including Grimble's Vinegar Factory, and replaced by council housing. In August 1938 the Cumberland Basin was dammed off and drained and in the next two years it was formally abandoned. By 15 January 1941 the Basin had been filled in with rubble from London's bombing and in the years following the Second World War the site was covered with topsoil and turned into allotments.Hugh Compton & Alan Faulkner. \\"The Cumberland Market Branch of the Regent's Canal\\". Journal of the Railway and Canal Historical Society. 2006. No.194, pp.254-261. Being so close to both Euston and King's Cross stations it was inevitable that the area would have been so heavily bombed during the Second World War. A V1 rocket landed on the NE corner in 1944 and the buildings on the SE corner were damaged beyond repair. General blast damage was also sustained in the SW corner.The London County Council Bomb Damage Maps 1939-1945. London Topographical Society. LTS Publication No. 164. 2005. Map 49.

Early years Warde was raised in Danbury, Connecticut. Stage Warde gained early acting experience at the Pasadena Playhouse and performed with the Federal Theatre Project. In 1940, he toured with the Eighteen Actors dramatic group, which included Victor Jory and Morris Ankrum, among others. In 1953, he worked in summer stock theatre. Film Warde started his Hollywood career in Escape by Night, appearing in a handful of undistinguished feature films before gaining popularity as one of the hardest working henchmen in the 1930s and 1940s serials. Warde first appeared in his first film bow in 1936, but he spent most of his time bothering serials heroes as a vicious bodyguard, underground leader or infamous rustler, but also was satisfactory in character roles and the occasional sympathetic part. Usually, he played in many unsavory characterizations, including low-budget crime and Western styles throughout his career. He also appeared in popular serials such as Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars (1938), for Universal; The Spider Returns (1941) and Batman (1943) for Columbia, as well as in The Masked Marvel (1943), The Purple Monster Strikes (1945) and The Black Widow (1947) for Republic. But Warde is probably best remembered for playing Killer Kane, gangster ruler of the Earth in Universal's adaptation of Buck Rogers (1939). In the 1950s, he made a multiple number of TV appearances including a brief turn as a counterfeiter in two episodes of Amos 'N' Andy. Warde made his last screen appearance in The Carpetbaggers, a 1964 film adaptation of Harold Robbins' best-seller novel. Following his acting career, he owned a men's clothing store. Death Warde died in Hollywood, California, at the age of 66.

Sunfish Lake is a small, 25 hectare meromictic lake located north-west of Waterloo, Ontario, in the village of St. Agatha in northern Wilmot Township, and is the source of Laurel Creek. It is one of a few meromictic lakes in Ontario, that is, its deep bottom waters (21 metres or 70 feet) are totally devoid of oxygen. The surface and bottom layers do not mix, and the lake is vulnerable to environmental damage.GRCA - The Grand Strategy Restrictions on lake use include no motorized boats, no fertilizer or pesticide use, and regular septic tank inspections. Sunfish Lake is often compared to Paradise Lake which is about 3 km to the north-west, in Wellesley Township. Paradise Lake is a much larger lake and accommodates many more properties with the ability to live year-round. There are about 20 cottages and homes on the lake, of which only a small handful are zoned for year-round residence, the rest are zoned recreational and are not used nor lanes cleared during the winter. Sunfish Lake Association The Sunfish Lake Association was formed in 1961 by Edna Staebler and Jack Hutchison and is an incorporated, charitable group with a mandate of stewarding and protecting the Sunfish Lake area. The Sunfish Lake Association has been instrumental in engaging the media and the community in the Region of Waterloo's Environmentally Sensitive Lands initiative, which is similar to a local greenway. Throughout the 1960s, the ecological health of the area improved and in 1978 the Association co-ordinated the creation of Sunfish Holdings, Inc. to purchase environmentally sensitive lands surrounding Sunfish Lake to guarantee future protection. In the 1980s, an intensive program of harvesting chara to remove an abundance of nutrients in the lake was undertaken, along with limiting the lake to counteract the effects of acid rain. Stewardship efforts continued in the 1990s and 2000s with efforts to control purple loosestrife, a new forest management program and considerable efforts to protect a broader area around the lake with the Laurel Creek Headwaters Environmentally Sensitive Landscape greenbelt initiative. The association members have also been supportive of Ontario Nature's greenway initiative, and regularly share their experiences with engaging landowners and the broader community. The group owns and stewards of woodland and wetland surrounding Sunfish Lake. They have undertaken tree planting projects, and have conducted a fish survey of Sunfish Lake.Ontario Nature Network Groups See also *List of lakes in Ontario  References  Lakes of Ontario ","title":"Sunfish Lake (Ontario)"},{"id":"18785170","text":"is a railway station on the Ainokaze Toyama Railway Line in the city of Namerikawa, Toyama Prefecture, Japan, operated by the third-sector railway operator Ainokaze Toyama Railway.

Arts at the Old Fire Station ('The OFS') is an arts centre in Oxford comprising a Theatre, Gallery and Shop. There are also studios available to hire for classes, rehearsals and meetings. The organisation focuses on three key things: * presenting new work across art forms * supporting artists * including people facing tough times. The Old Fire Station building is shared between Arts at the OFS and Crisis Skylight Oxford. The Arts side put on great shows and exhibitions, and Crisis support people who are homeless with housing and employment advice. The two organisations work closely together. People experiencing homelessness help to run the arts centre as volunteers, artists, staff and trustees. By sharing the building and working together, the two charities have created a unique public space. Everyone who comes in - from coffee drinkers to comedy fans, and people sleeping rough to birthday card buyers - are coming through the same door and sharing the same space. And they're all in the right place. = Social impact = Oxford is globally renowned for stunning heritage and outstanding research. It is also a place of disadvantage and inequality and is sometimes regarded as closed. Homeless people by definition do not have access to their own private and secure space in which to carry out various daily life functions, let alone enjoyable, fulfilling, or productive activities. This results in a never- ending cycle of material hardship, ill health, stigma, distrust and marginalisation. The Old Fire Station is about openness, inclusion, looking forward and different thinking. It acts as a bridge between sectors, organisations and people. Seeing, participating in and making art engages, excites and stretches people, encouraging new voices and unexpected connections. Arts at the Old Fire Station featured in the BBC Four documentary Life Is A Circus by Jo Elliot. The film focused on a project called Hidden Spire where people experiencing homelessness came together with professional theatre-makers to make a brand new, high quality theatre production from scratch. The results were transformative and the film captured the attention of many in showing the meaningful changes that happened in the lives of people facing tough times when they were given a voice through the arts. = History = The building has experienced been many different things since it opened. Locals remember it as a nightclub, a science museum, and an arts centre back in the 1980s. Originally, it was a Victorian fire station and corn exchange.

Biography Reid started racing in 1976 at St. Angelo airfield, Enniskillen, and had his first road race the same year at the Dundrod Circuit in Killinchy 150, riding a TD3 250 Yamaha. His first road race win came in 1979 at a wet Carrowdore meeting riding a 125cc Morbidelli. He first tackled the Isle of Man course for the Manx Grand Prix in 1978, riding a Yamaha TZ250 which seized in the Newcomers race and threw him off at Cruickshanks corner in Ramsey. His best result at the Manx was a second place in the Senior race riding a Ray Cowles-sponsored RG500 Suzuki in 1980. Reid's first TT race came in 1981, without much luck, but he won the first of his national championships the 350cc Ulster Grand Prix that same year. In 1982 Reid created history by becoming the first to win 3 Irish road race championships in one year, taking the 250cc, 350cc and 500cc titles. 1983 saw him crowned Irish Motorcyclist of the Year which he also won again in 1989. In 1984 Reid turned his attention to the Formula TT world championship racing, sponsored by Mick Mooney of Irish Racing Motorcycles on a privately entered 350cc Yamaha. In that first year Reid collected a bronze medal and, but for a breakdown at the Ulster Grand Prix, could have been gold. Reid made amends in 1985 by taking gold with wins in Portugal, Spain and the Ulster, and repeated the feat in 1986 to be a double world champion; he also had the first of his 5 TT wins in this year. 1989 saw the launch of the Regal 600cc championship which Reid dominating from the beginning, taking the title on the Budweiser Yamaha. He retained his title in 1990 and won his second TT in the Supersport 600cc. Reid went on to take TT wins in 1992, with a double in the Supersport 400cc and Junior 250cc, and in 1993 with a Junior 250cc win. In 1994 his career ended when he was involved in a serious accident at the Temple 100, which ultimately caused his retirement from racing.

It chronicles the lives of three generations of performers on the Cotton Blossom, a floating theater on a steamboat that travels between small towns along the banks of the Mississippi River, from the 1880s to the 1920s. The story moves from the Reconstruction Era riverboat to Gilded Age Chicago to Roaring Twenties New York, and finally returns to the Mississippi River. Show Boat was adapted as a Broadway musical in 1927 by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II. Three films followed: a 1929 version that depended partly on the musical, and two full adaptations of the musical in 1936 and 1951. Background In August 1924, Edna Ferber watched as the opening performance of her play Minick (co- written with George S. Kaufman) was disrupted by an invasion of bats that had been nesting undetected in the chandeliers and dome of the playhouse. Alarmed theatergoers scurried for the exits. As the crew recovered from this debacle, Winthrop Ames, the show's producer, jokingly remarked: \\"Next time... we won't bother with tryouts. We'll all charter a show boat and we'll just drift down the rivers, playing the towns as we come to them.\\" Show boats were floating theaters that traveled along rivers of the United States from the 1870s to the 1930s. The performers lived aboard the vessels. With song, dance, and dramatic productions, show boats provided entertainment for small riverside towns that were otherwise quite isolated. Ferber, who had never heard of show boats, was immediately intrigued: > \\"Here, I thought, was one of the most melodramatic and gorgeous bits of > Americana that had ever come my way. It was not only the theater ‚Äî it was > the theater plus the glamour of the wandering drifting life, the drama of > the river towns, the mystery and terror of the Mississippi itself... I spent > a year hunting down every available scrap of show-boat material; reading, > interviewing, taking notes and making outlines.\\" In 1925, Ferber traveled to Bath, North Carolina, and spent four days aboard one of the few remaining show boats in the country, the James Adams Floating Theatre, which plied the Pamlico River and Great Dismal Swamp Canal. An account of Ferber's visit to Bath is posted at NCHistoricSites.org. The material she gathered, especially the reminiscences of Charles Hunter, the director and chief actor, provided her with \\"a treasure-trove of show-boat material, human, touching, true.\\" Ferber spent the next year in France and New York writing the novel, and published it in the summer of 1926. The mix of romance, realistic depiction of racial issues, and nostalgia for a vanishing American past was an immediate hit with the public, and the novel was number one on the bestseller lists for twelve weeks. The critical reception was more cautious but still positive. In his New York Times review, Louis Kronenberger wrote: > \\"With Show Boat, Miss Ferber establishes herself not as one of those who are > inaugurating first-rate literature, but as one of those who are reviving > first-rate story-telling. This is little else but an irresistible story; but > that, surely, is enough.\\" By the time the James Adams Floating Theatre was destroyed by fire in 1941, the era of show boats had ended, supplanted by the motion pictures theater. Includes the history of the James Adams Floating Theatre Plot The time is the late nineteenth century. Captain Andy Hawks is a former riverboat owner with a shrewish wife, Parthy Ann, and a 10-year-old daughter, Magnolia. He buys the new show boat Cotton Blossom. Among its acting cast are Julie Dozier and her husband Steve Baker, and Ellie Chipley and her husband, affectionately known as \\"Schultzy\\". Other members of the crew are Pete, the engineer of the towboat Mollie Able, which propels the show boat; Frank the utility man; and Windy McClain, the pilot. Steve and Julie are close, and Julie becomes Magnolia's best friend, showing motherly affection toward her. For a time, all is well, but soon Pete begins making unwanted advances toward Julie. He gets into a fist fight with Steve, is soundly beaten, and swears revenge. He implies knowing some dark secret concerning Julie. When the troupe arrives in fictional Lemoyne, Mississippi, Pete steals Julie's picture from the box office and takes it to the local sheriff. Julie claims she does not feel well enough to perform, and Parthy observes that Julie fell sick the year before in the same town. When they hear what Pete has done, Steve takes out a pocket knife, makes a cut on Julie's hand, and sucks blood from it. The sheriff arrives and announces that there is a miscegenation case on board: since Julie is black and Steve is white, their marriage is illegal. Julie admits that she is half-black. Ellie, who has been very close to Julie, becomes upset at the revelation and hysterically denounces her friend. Steve says he has \\"negro blood\\" in him, and the rest of the company backs him up. The sheriff, not realizing that Steve's claim is based only on his having sucked some blood from Julie's hand, recites as Mississippi law that \\"one drop of Negro blood makes you a Negro in these parts\\". Although still suspicious, he is convinced by Windy, a boyhood friend, that he cannot arrest the couple and leaves. He tells Steve and Julie to leave the boat, which they do, after Julie sorrowfully says goodbye to the girl Magnolia. Years later the plot returns to the boat, where Magnolia is now 18 and the newest leading lady. She has no leading man. After Gaylord Ravenal, a handsome riverboat gambler, is hired, he and Magnolia promptly fall in love and elope. Months later, Magnolia has had a baby daughter, whom she names Kim (because she was born at the moment when the Cotton Blossom was at the convergence on the Mississippi of the states of Kentucky, Illinois, and Missouri). Shortly afterward, Captain Andy falls overboard during a storm and drowns. Rather than live with the stern Parthy, Magnolia and Ravenal leave for Chicago with Kim. In the big city, the couple is alternately rich and poor, depending on Ravenal's gambling winnings (he does not try to find regular work, and cheats on Magnolia with prostitutes). Finally, after about ten years, Parthy announces she is coming to visit. The destitute Ravenal, desperate for money, borrows some from Hetty Chilson, the local whorehouse madam. He returns to Magnolia at their boarding house but is drunk. As he sleeps off his stupor, Magnolia returns the money to Hetty and discovers the madam's secretary is Julie Dozier. Julie is devastated that Magnolia has found her working in the whorehouse. (The fate of Steve goes unmentioned in the novel.) When Magnolia returns to the boarding house, she finds Ravenal gone, having left behind nothing but a farewell note. She never sees him again. She goes out to get work and is hired at a local nightclub called Joppers. The story moves forward to 1926, when show boats are becoming scarce on the Mississippi River. Kim has married and become a successful actress on Broadway in New York City. Her father Ravenal has been dead for several years. One night, Magnolia receives a telegram announcing the death of her mother Parthy, from whom she has been long estranged. She returns to the show boat, which she decides to keep and manage, rather than to scrap. She gives all of her inheritance from Parthy, a fortune, to her daughter Kim. Joining Magnolia is Ellie, a widow since her husband Schultzy has died. Musical adaptation Although Brooks Atkinson, the noted New York Times theatre critic, proclaimed the musical adaptation as being \\"positively slavish\\" to the novel, Hammerstein made several changes in adapting it to the musical stage. Radio On March 31, 1939, on The Campbell Playhouse, Orson Welles presented a dramatic hourlong version of the Ferber novel in which he played the role of Captain Andy, and author Edna Ferber made her acting debut as Parthy. Margaret Sullavan played Magnolia as an adult, William Johnstone played Ravenal and, because of her success onstage in the role, Helen Morgan played Julie, though the one song she sang had nothing to do with the stage version of Show Boat. It was one of Morgan's last public appearances before her untimely death in 1941. On February 20 and 27, 2011, a two-part version of Show Boat was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in the Classic Serial spot. Based only on Ferber's novel, it was dramatised by Moya O'Shea, produced/directed by Tracey Neale, and starred Lysette Anthony as Kim, Samantha Spiro as Magnolia, Laurel Lefkow as Parthy, Morgan Deare as Cap'n Andy, Ryan McCluskey as Gaylord and Nonso Anozie as Jo, with original music by Neil Brand.

History and Funding Euroscript was set up in 1995 by The London Screenwriters' Workshop (later known as the Screenwriters‚Äô Workshop) with the aim of improving the quality of film scripts going into production in Europe. It received its initial funding from the European Commission‚Äôs Media IIhttp://ec.europa.eu/information_society/media/overview/media2/index_en.htm programme, but is now financially independent. Aims and Methods Influential figures such as cinematographer Brian Tufano (director of photography on a range of successful films including Quadrophenia, Billy Elliot and Trainspotting) have pointed out that many British and European scripts go into production too early,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4724247/What-happened-to-British- cinema.html leading to sub-standard films.http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sex_lives_of_the_potato_men/ This is partly due to European producers lacking the funds to pay writers for adequate script development  but also to a culture which underestimates its importance. Euroscript‚Äôs brief is to rectify these problems, developing writers‚Äô careers and creative skills over a sustained period through courses and workshops,http://jezfreedman.blogspot.com/2008/10/eurporscript-exciting- treatments.htmlhttp://jezfreedman.blogspot.com/2008/10/euroscript-comedy- writing-workshop.html and facilitating the creation of high-quality, marketable screenplays. Euroscript's stated aim is to create a community offering screen, TV and radio writers support and guiding them through all the stages of script development. Its script editors give writers one-to-one help in an extended development programme which nurses projects from initial idea to final draft. Producers and production companies use Euroscript as an ancillary script department, outsourcing development tasks to its team of editors. Screen Story Competition Euroscript's annual Screen Story Competition was launched in 1994, again with backing from the Media II programme. Philippa Goslett is a previous winner with her script Little Ashes,http://www.littleashes-themovie.com/synopsis.php which dramatises the complex relationships between Salvador Dal√≠, Federico Garc√≠a Lorca and Luis Bu√±uel. The film, which was script-edited by Lara Masters for Euroscript, has recently been released (directed by Paul Morrison) and has garnered some excellent reviews.http://www.backstage.com/bso/reviews-movie-tv- reviews/little-ashes-1003968645.story Paul Sellars is another previous winner with his drama The Judas Boy. Worldwide Links Euroscript has launched numerous foreign initiatives, its most recent venture being a series of Danish workshops in conjunction with the Copenhagen Screenwriting School. Euroscript Promotion Euroscript is currently setting up a new initiative aimed at promoting the best scripts from its consultancy programme to the film industry. It will take no fee for this service, but will ask for a script- editing credit should the film be made. The Euroscript Team Euroscript comprises a diverse team of industry professionals including producers, working screenwriters, script consultants, film-makers and intellectual property lawyers.

Soundscape SSHDR1  Soundscape was formed in the UK when in early 1992, Chris Wright, the head designer and Technical Manager for Cheetah Marketing Ltd., with Belgian designer Johan Bonnaerens and Cheetah, together with Johan's employer Sydec NV agreed a plan to jointly design, manufacture and market a modular 4 track hard disk based Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). The SSHDR1 DAW became, if not the first, certainly one of the first products of this kind available and was showcased as an 8 track system at the NAMM and Musik Messe trade shows in 1993. Cheetah's parent company Cannon Street Investments was struggling during the UK recession and closed the company in March 1993, splitting off the computer peripherals division (which principally manufactured joysticks such as Bart Simpson, Batman and Alien licensed designs) to another company in the group. Chris Wright along with Sales Manager Nick Owen bought the assets of the Cheetah music products division, forming Soundscape Digital Technology Ltd., immediately took on two of the ex-Cheetah employees (Marcus Case - Production Manager and Kirstie Davies - Operations Manager) and started to market and manufacture the Soundscape SSHDR1, shipping the first batch of 100 units in August 1993. Like Chris, who had started designing products for music (synthesizers, effects, samplers, keyboards, drum machines) in his spare time (his day job was as a Senior Electronics Designer in telecoms), Johan was also an avid rock guitar player and music fan and had started the design at home. A long experienced audio designer himself, Chris contributed in some of the key elements of the DSP (Digital Signal Processing) code such as how to efficiently implement real-time fade curves, and digital compressors and chase locking to timecode, and his experience of EMC shielding and testing techniques enabled rapid EMC approval to be gained. He later concentrated on developing the specifications for the Soundscape products as they moved into the demanding high end markets in broadcast and film sound. Johan concentrated mainly on the Windows software and another engineer took over the DSP code. The system rapidly gained market success, shipping over 700 systems in the first year and garnered excellent reviews throughout the music and recording press in Europe, Australia and the USA, and featured on the front page of most major magazines. The system was renowned for its bulletproof stability, something that was the holy grail of computer based recording on PCs. This was due to its split design with separate Motorola 56000 DSP powered hardware that was controlled by Windows editing software. The hardware took the strain allowing a very light demand on the PC, so that other MIDI sequencers such as eMagic Logic, Steinberg Cubase, Cakewalk and others could be used simultaneously. The boast was that even if the PC crashed, the system would continue recording, and this was demonstrated regularly. The result was that while most other computer based recording/editing systems were all studio based, Soundscape could also be used for live recording and could be relied upon for recording 100 piece orchestras with no risk. Integration of the SSHDR1 hardware within eMagic Logic Audio and Cakewalk was developed by both companies using the Soundscape API.  Design elements  The modular nature and expandability to 16 units connected to one PC was also somewhat unusual. Initially launched as a 4 track 16bit, 48 kHz system and using inexpensive IDE drives (the first units shipped with 2 x 120MB drives), advances in the efficiency of the DSP code extended this first to 8 tracks with 24bit recording and then with the addition of a second DSP board, to 12 tracks and also added the world's first configurable DSP based digital mixer. Huge systems could be configured as just 8 units coupled together formed a 96 track system with sample accurate synchronisation and could be controlled from one editing screen. The unit also had removable drive trays fitted as it had become cost efficient to simply put drives on the shelf as they cost far less per hour of audio than master tape. Soundscape also produced a range of modular audio interface units that connected to the Soundscape SSHDR1 unit via TDIF. Soundscape took a bold decision to offer free of charge software updates to their users, a decision that generated user loyalty of a level previously unknown for computer based audio products. Added to that, the quality of the product release remained incredibly high and bugs were virtually non-existent.  Soundscape R.Ed, Mixtreme and Mixpander cards  In 1997 the Soundscape R.Ed system was released which offered 32 tracks per units at up to 24bit 96 kHz and had two removable and two fixed drive bays. IDE disks, which at first had been ridiculed by many as non-professional, nevertheless had dominated the PC market and were approximately half the price of SCSI. The system could now contain a massive amount of inexpensive storage and was as reliable as ever. The limitation of the system compared to the market leader Pro Tools, had always been the amount of DSP power available for mixing and effects, but in 2000, this was removed with the launch of the Mixpander card, which added 9 of the latest super powerful Motorola 563xx DSPs to the system, connected via a fast bus, and so finally a vast amount of real-time DSP processing power was available. From 1993 to 2000 approximately 10,000 Soundscape systems were shipped and were being used in many professional applications as well as in home studios. Several successful Hollywood produced TV shows such as Mad About You and Frasier were almost completely edited using Soundscape, systems were in use in large numbers throughout the CBC in Canada and other broadcasters in many countries, large multitrack systems in recording studios. Soundscape had introduced an entire recording generation to digital recording and editing many of whom had previously never even used a computer. This system was very simple to use but contained powerful editing tools, real-time plug-in effects and had wide-ranging support throughout the industry with Soundscape format plug-ins developed by many top companies such as TC Electronics, Dolby, Drawmer, CEDAR Audio Ltd, Synchro Arts etc. Also there were some 30 to 40 companies developing or including Soundscape hardware in their products, from radio automation companies such as RCS, D.A.V.I.D and Dalet Digital Media Systems to video NLE manufacturers such as DPS and D-Vision (later Discreet) and many others who used Soundscape Mixtreme cards and Soundscape iBox audio interfaces. The Mixtreme card, first shipped in 1998 was Soundscape's first PCI card and utilised the DSP mixer developed for the Soundscape SSHDR1 so that along with 16 channels of I/O, it could also support the full range of Soundscape format real-time DSP effects plug-ins available. This was a unique card and the first of its type. Over the next few years many thousands of cards were shipped and it gained wide recognition as a very flexible and future proof audio solution.  Demise  In 1997 Sydec had started to run into hard times, as following a management buyout from their parent company Niko (a Belgian manufacturer of electrical products such as light fittings), the managing director had become ill, they had a dispute with their former owners and the result was that 50% of the expected income disappeared virtually overnight. The Soundscape side of Sydec's business, which by now had risen to approximately 10 people, half of the company, was still doing well, but without income from the other half, Sydec needed extra revenue badly. Chris Wright started to develop ideas to port the DSP core of the Soundscape R.Ed as a stand-alone recorder engine and began to discuss this with his contacts at Tascam in Japan. A plan was formed to provide a 24 track recorder plug-in board for Tascam digital mixers, but at the end Tascam didn't sign the contract as they had received a better offer from one of their existing 3rd party developers (in end the product never appeared). Chris Wright then presented the same idea to Mackie (which at the time was a $300 million NASDAQ listed corporation) and an agreement was made to produce a stand-alone 24 track recorder, that eventually became the Mackie SDR2496. Mackie held off on signing the contract, as their investigations into Sydec's heath had shown that the company was vulnerable and eventually made an offer to buy the shares of Sydec which was accepted. Mackie announced to the world's music industry that they had bought Soundscape at the NAMM show in 2001, which wasn't correct, and in doing so infringed the images, logos copyright owned by Soundscape Digital Technology Ltd. Soundscape's distribution network and customers became extremely nervous and business stalled, just as the long- awaited Mixpander was being launched. Soundscape disputed Mackie's use of their intellectual property and a legal action ensued ending in the High Court in London. An agreement was struck in May 2003 whereby Soundscape could resume its business without interference from Mackie, but following 5 months with no sales, a large legal bill and the slow summer months ahead, from being in a healthy position at the end of 2000, Soundscape now found itself in difficulties and decided to close its doors in September 2001. Chris Wright joined Teac and Nick Owen started a video dealer based in Cardiff, Wales. The sales completely halted as the Soundscape distribution network suddenly had no access to the product and the deep knowledge and energy of the Soundscape team that had driven the product to success had disappeared. Far from being the saviour, Mackie was unable to handle the product and for 1 year there was very little activity and almost no sales. In 2002 the Soundscape R.Ed was rebadged as the Mackie Soundscape 32 and re-launched, but the product was by then based on a design that had been conceived over 10 years earlier and the hardware design for the Soundscape R.Ed was originally started in 1995. Times had moved on and more powerful or native processing products (using the CPU of the PC) had become available such as Nuendo, Pyramix and Pro Tools LE and these were much less expensive. Since 2001, Pyramix particularly had begun to fill the void vacated by Soundscape. Mackie was also haemorrhaging cash in many areas and in 2003 suddenly closed Sydec's doors. Having picked themselves off the floor, Sydec's MD together with Johan Bonnaerens and 3 others reformed as Sydec Audio Engineering and made a deal with Mackie to sell off the stock of Mackie built units. The incredibly loyal Soundscape user base was relieved as they had become very disillusioned with Mackie, but it was difficult to make headway with such a small team. The company continued without great success until 2006, when they were purchased by Solid State Logic. The company continues to develop and release new software. The hardware department now focusses more on Audio Acquisition and Format Converters (such as their iBox range). As of 2010, the Soundscape 32 system and iBox range was still available. One problem is that IDE disk drives have largely been replaced by SATA and the Soundscape 32 units cannot support them. The current focus is to utilise hard disks connected to the PC together with a Mixpander card, providing a way that the software can operate without relying on the external units. The latest range has focussed on MADI connections, but this is a relatively niche area.

Schuyler Island was involved in the 1776 Battle of Valcour during the American Revolutionary War, and is today managed as part of Adirondack Park, with several unimproved campsites available. History The island played a brief role during the American Revolutionary War. Following the Battle of Valcour on October 11, 1776, the fleet of American General Benedict Arnold used the island as a location to regroup and commence repairs. Two small ships of the fleet that were deemed beyond repair were sunk near the island at this time. The island passed through a series of private owners during the 19th and early to mid 20th centuries, during which time the island was occasionally farmed. The island became alternately known as \\"Whitney Island\\" in reference to the Whitney family, who owned the island between 1891 and 1950. The island was sold to New York State in November 1967, originally intended for inclusion in a regional outdoor recreation complex; however none of the planned improvements were enacted on the island. Public use The island is today designated as the Schuyler Island Primitive Area within New York's Adirondack Park. It is administered by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Unimproved camping sites are available and the island is a popular stop for lake boaters. Hunting for whitetail deer and waterfowl is permitted on the island.

The story involves a young Wallasey boy, Johnny Brent (Fox), who obtains the eponymous magnet by deception, leading to much confusion. When he is acclaimed as a hero, he is shamed by his own sense of guilt. Plot 11 year old Johnny Brent (Fox), home from school during a scarlet fever outbreak, but not making much attempt to stay isolated. He goes to the coast in Liverpool to watch his father board a ship and then spends the rest of the morning wandering around the beach. He manages to con a younger boy out of a large horseshoe magnet by trading it for an \\"invisible watch\\". The other boy's nanny is not happy with the swap. Johnny is almost run over and sees it as karma and decides to get rid of the magnet. After an older boy uses the magnet to cheat at pinball and Johnny is implicated, Johnny continues to try to get rid of the magnet. He meets an eccentric iron lung maker who is raising funds for the local hospital, and gives him the magnet to be auctioned for charity. The iron lung maker, rather bizarrely demonstrating his equipment in the middle of a seaside beauty contest, tells the story of the magnet at various fund-raising events, exaggerating wildly and portraying Johnny as everything from a spoiled brat to a Dickensian ragamuffin. He auctions the magnet to the crowd and sells it for ¬£40. No one wants it though and it keeps coming back allowing it to be repeatedly auctioned, On a train returning to school, Johnny sees the little boy's nanny and overhears her telling her friend about her budgerigar, which she says has died of a broken heart. Johnny mistakenly thinks she is talking about the little boy himself, and becomes convinced that he has caused the death of the boy. Various other things he overhears confirms his theory. His mum realises something is wrong and tries to make him feel useful. She sends him to the local Maypole Dairy on an errand. He is again startled by a policeman and hides in the back of a Jacob's cream crackers van, which takes him to the Liverpool slums, where he comes into conflict with the local boys. He wins them over by convincing them he is a fugitive from the police. They hide him in a building on the disused pier. They leave him a tin of soup and some dry macaroni. He saves the life of one boy who had fallen through a disused pier. The injured boy ends up in an iron lung made by the man to whom Johnny gave the magnet. When Johnny visits the boy, he sees the magnet mounted on the iron lung and is reunited with the inventor, who is delighted to have found Johnny again. Johnny is awarded the Civic Gold Medal. When he later re- encounters the original boy on the beach he swaps the medal for his old \\"invisible watch\\" and clears his conscience.

Given its setting, however, authentic local accents are absent until almost the end of the film, in a scene filmed in the shadow of the Liverpool Cathedral. A Chinese boy appears in this scene, which was unusual for the time in film, although there had been a significant Chinese community in Liverpool since the 1860s, but when he is called home by his mother in Chinese, explains this to his friends in a fluent Liverpool accent. James Fox (then known as William) had appeared in The Miniver Story earlier in the year, and this was his first starring role, at the age of 11; his performance was largely appreciated, being described by the British Film Institute's reviewer as \\"certainly lively enough as the over-imaginative Johnny\\". Stalwarts of Ealing's repertory ensemble, however, such as Stanley Holloway and Alec Guinness, were absent, although James Robertson Justice made a small appearance as a tramp, using a Gaelic pseudonym;Alleged to mean \\"Big James with the beard\\": at the time he was a candidate in the General Election. Reception The film has not achieved the general popularity of better-known Ealing comedies such as Passport to Pimlico and The Lavender Hill Mob, although it is described as \\"a mild-mannered affair and the comedy gives way to a decidedly poignant conclusion\\". Leslie Halliwell similarly described it as a \\"very mild Ealing comedy, not really up to snuff\\". The British Film Institute's reviewer criticised it as \\"somewhat burdened by cumbersome moralising and too many credibility-stretching coincidences and misunderstandings\\" and described it as \\"an attempt to revisit the success of Clarke's earlier Hue and Cry\\". The film was a box office disappointment.Robert Murphy, Realism and Tinsel: Cinema and Society in Britain 1939-48 2003 p212 References External links * 1950 films 1950 comedy films British films British comedy films Films directed by Charles Frend English-language films Ealing Studios films Films set in Liverpool Films produced by Michael Balcon Films scored by William Alwyn ","title":"The Magnet (film)"},{"id":"18785529","text":"F√¢nt√¢nele is a commune in Ia»ôi County, Western Moldavia, Romania.

It was one of several comedies Lee made while under contract at Rank.

Pic will cash in with the lower bracket audiences and nabe houses...

It stars Robert Beatty as Gulliver Shields, an Irish customs official who dreams of living on a South Sea island; particularly Rarotonga. It is based on the book by Kenneth Reddin, an Irish judge. Plot The opening credits initially say \\"a comedy\\" but this is changed to \\"a tragedy\\". The orchestra plays Molly Malone as credits roll on a background of shamrocks telling the viewer that the setting is Ireland, Gulliver leaves a building in Dublin and walks through the Fusiliers' Arch into St Stephen's Green to sit on a park bench. THere he daydreams of beaches. A refined gent (Stanley Holloway) sits next to him for some minutes before going to a bar. Gulliver goes to a different bar. A very quiet one. He reads a newspaper article about a car crash on Grafton Street. He then goes to the street and waits for the next accident, but when two women crash he declines to be a witness. He waits a week on the courtroom steps .. the woman eventually sees him .. they had met before on a beach. He goes to meet her later in a bar with her friends. He resumes his stance on the steps of the bank on Grafton Street but his harassed due to his continual presence. Acquiring a small dog partly resolves this. He is happy when the next accident happens: an old lady is hit by a car while crossing. He helps her hoping for a reward but is only given a luncheon voucher. The girl Jennifer passes somewhat tipsy and asks him to call a taxi. He joins her and they go to her palatial home. Over dinner he at last explains his plan. In his mind, he will rescue and they will reward him with an amount of money to get him to the South Seas. She clearly likes him but he runs off. He returns to his position on Grafton Street. The next accident is a Rolls Royce hitting a boy on a bicycle. The man (the same man who earlier sat by him in the park) in the car claims the greater injury. They go to a bar together. They appear to have parallel dreams except Gulliver seeks Rarotonga and the man wishes Tahiti. They meet a third time in a lawyers office when the man goes to bewail the loss of his wife: running away with his chauffeur. A plan to go together to the South Seas is formulated to the dismay of Jennifer. On the way to the boat their car crashes on Grafton Street. Gulliver breaks his arm. Jennifer arrives and her friend Yellow takes Gulliver's place on the trip. Gulliver stays with Jennifer.

The connector carries signals for analogue and digital RGB, RGB intensity, and genlocking as well as power. Default Amiga screenmodes are directly compatible with TVs in the region in which the computer was sold, so that the user could connect the computer to a common TV if no monitor was available. In the PAL region, the Amiga could be connected directly to the standardized SCART RGB connector on the TV via an adapter cable sold by Commodore, providing superior image quality. Alternatively, Commodore sold an adapter (the A520), that attached to the Amiga video connector and provided composite and RF outputs appropriate to the region in which it was sold. Commodore also sold a range of monitors, which were compatible with the TV signals of the region in which they were sold, and in the PAL region many even had SCART inputs so that not only Amigas, but also other SCART-compatible equipment (such as VCRs) could be attached to them. While most 1st and 2nd generation Amigas (with the original and the enhanced graphics chipsets) only could output TV compatible screenmodes (15 kHz horizontal refresh rate), the Amiga 3000 also featured a connector for VGA type monitors, providing 30 kHz refresh rate. The 3rd (and last) generation of Amiga computers (with the Advanced Graphics Array chipset) could output a wide range of resolutions and refresh rates, and Commodore introduced a line of multisync monitors to accommodate this. These computers could also output directly to the VGA monitors that by then had become commonplace, provided they were configured to output in a VGA compatible resolution and refresh rate.

After return to commercial service as Oliver Olson the ship was wrecked at the entrance to Bandon harbor in Oregon.  Construction  The ship was built in 1918, by Albina Engine and Machine Works, Portland, Oregon as the yard's hull #3 being built for foreign owners with keel laid on 29 May 1917. The hull was requisitioned by the United States Shipping Board and launched 27 March 1918 as Point Bonita. The ship was delivered on 24 June 1918.  World War I service Point Bonita was acquired on 7 October 1918 by the Navy and commissioned the same date Lieutenant Commander P. J. Hansen, USNRF, in command. The ship was assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service. The ship departed New York 19 October in convoy and arrived at Nantes on 7 November with a cargo of military supplies and high explosives. After unloading she departed 15 November for Brest to join a westbound convoy on 18 November arriving at New York 16 December. There she loaded a cargo for the USSB, picked up Navy coal at Norfolk and departed for Hawaii 8 January 1919 arriving at Pearl Harbor 7 February. Upon arrival back at New York Point Bonita decommissioned and was transferred to the USSB on 7 April 1919.  Interwar civilian service  In 1920 Point Bonita was sold to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company where she was engaged in freight only trade between San Francisco and Baltimore with a call at New York.  World War II service Oliver Olson was delivered to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) 25 April 1942 from Oliver J. Olson company at Honolulu, Hawaii and delivered to the Navy the same day under a sub bareboat charter with WSA. Commissioned on the day of delivery under the command of Lieutenant R. M. Baughman, USNR as Camanga the ship was designated AG-42. Illustrating graphically the need for all available shipping in meeting the Navy's enormous logistic assignment in the Pacific Ocean, Camanga, already 24 years old, sailed from Pearl Harbor 1 June 1942 for Pago Pago, Samoa, where she took up duty carrying cargo and fuel drums between the Samoan and Ellice Islands. After overhaul at San Francisco, California, between 30 March and 6 June 1943, Camanga returned to Noumea for operations throughout the South Pacific Ocean. She continued this essential back-area support of fleet operations from Guadalcanal to the islands of the Bismarck Archipelago between April and October 1944, returning then to base at Noum√©a. An overhaul at Auckland, New Zealand, from November 1944 to January 1945 was the only further interruption to her busy schedule in the New Caledonia area until 1 October 1945 when she cleared for the U.S. West Coast. During this period Camanga was assigned to Service Force Pacific Fleet and under the command of Lieutenant F.A. Muller and Lieutenant Commander J. W. Baldwin. Camanga was decommissioned at San Francisco, California, 10 December 1945 and returned to the War Shipping Administration the same day. Wreck Wreck of the Oliver Olson at Bandon, OR, South Jetty.

It was invented by Vladimir Yankov and first published in 2003. The essence of the DPH technology is embedding computer designed digital holograms inside a planar waveguide. Light propagates through the plane of the hologram instead of perpendicularly, allowing for a long interaction path. Benefits of a long interaction path have long been used by volume or thick holograms. Planar configuration of the hologram provider for easier access to the embedded diagram aiding in its manufacture. Light can be confined in waveguides by a refractive index gradient. Light propagates in a core layer, surrounded by a cladding layer(s), which should be selected the core refractive index Ncore is greater than that of cladding Nclad: Ncore> Nclad. Cylindrical waveguides (optical fibers) allow for one-dimensional light propagation along the axis. Planar waveguides, fabricated by sequential depositing flat layers of transparent materials with a proper refractive index gradient on a standard wafer, confine light in one direction (axis z) and permit free propagation in two others (axes x and y). Light waves propagating in the core infiltrate both cladding layers to a small degree. If the refractive index is modulated in the wave path, light of each given wavelength can be directed to the desired point. The DPH technology, or Yankov hologram, comprises design and fabrication of the holographic nano- structures inside a planar waveguide, providing light processing and control. There are many ways of modulating the core refractive index, the simplest of which is engraving the required pattern by nanolithography means. The modulation is created by embedding a digital hologram on the lower or upper core surface or on the both of them. According to NOD statement, standard lithographical processes can be used, making mass production straightforward and inexpensive. Nanoimprinting could be another viable method of fabricating DPH patterns. Each DPH pattern is customized for a given application and computer-generated. It consists of numerous nano-grooves, each about 100 nm wide, positioned in a way, providing maximum efficiency for a specific application. The devices are fabricated on standard wafers; one of typical devices is presented below (from the NOD web site). While the total number of nano-grooves is huge (‚â•106), a typical device size of DPH devices is on the millimeter scale. The small footprint of the DPH makes it possible to combine with other elements of photonic integrated circuits, such as coarse demultiplexers and interferometers. Nano-Optic Devices, LLC (NOD) developed the DPH technology and applied it for commercializing nano-spectrometers. There are additional numerous applications for the DPH in integrated optics.

It also allows applying incompressible-flow data to compressible-flow cases.  Mathematical formulation  Plot of the inverse Prandtl‚ÄìGlauert factor 1/\\\\beta as a function of freestream Mach number. Notice the infinite limit at Mach 1. Inviscid compressible flow over slender bodies is governed by linearized compressible small-disturbance potential equation: :\\\\phi_{xx} + \\\\phi_{yy} + \\\\phi_{zz} = M_\\\\infty^2 \\\\phi_{xx} \\\\quad \\\\mbox{(in flow field)} together with the small-disturbance flow-tangency boundary condition. :V_\\\\infty n_x + \\\\phi_y n_y + \\\\phi_z n_z = 0 \\\\quad \\\\mbox{(on body surface)} M_\\\\infty is the freestream Mach number, and n_x, n_y, n_z are the surface- normal vector components. The unknown variable is the perturbation potential \\\\phi(x,y,z), and the total velocity is given by its gradient plus the freestream velocity V_\\\\infty which is assumed here to be along x. :\\\\vec{V} = abla \\\\phi + V_\\\\infty \\\\hat{x} = (V_\\\\infty + \\\\phi_x) \\\\hat{x} + \\\\phi_y \\\\hat{y} + \\\\phi_z \\\\hat{z} The above formulation is valid only if the small-disturbance approximation applies, : abla \\\\phi  \\\\ll V_\\\\infty and in addition that there is no transonic flow, approximately stated by the requirement that the local Mach number not exceed unity. :\\\\left[1 + (\\\\gamma+1) \\\\frac{\\\\phi_x}{V_\\\\infty} \\\\right] M_\\\\infty^2 < 1 The Prandtl‚ÄìGlauert (PG) transformation uses the Prandtl‚ÄìGlauert factor \\\\beta \\\\equiv \\\\sqrt{1 - M_\\\\infty^2}. It consists of scaling down all y and z dimensions and angle of attack by the factor of \\\\beta, the potential by \\\\beta^2, and the x component of the normal vectors by \\\\beta: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\bar{x} &= x \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\bar{y} &= \\\\beta y \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\bar{z} &= \\\\beta z \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\bar{\\\\alpha} &= \\\\beta \\\\alpha \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\bar{\\\\phi} &= \\\\beta^2 \\\\phi \\\\end{align} This \\\\bar{x}\\\\bar{y}\\\\bar{z} geometry will then have normal vectors whose x components are reduced by \\\\beta from the original ones: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\bar{n}_{\\\\bar{x}} &= \\\\beta n_x \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\bar{n}_{\\\\bar{y}} &= n_y \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\bar{n}_{\\\\bar{z}} &= n_z \\\\end{align} The small-disturbance potential equation then transforms to the Laplace equation, :\\\\bar{\\\\phi}_{\\\\bar{x}\\\\bar{x}} + \\\\bar{\\\\phi}_{\\\\bar{y}\\\\bar{y}} + \\\\bar{\\\\phi}_{\\\\bar{z}\\\\bar{z}} = 0 \\\\quad \\\\mbox{(in flow field)} and the flow-tangency boundary condition retains the same form. :V_\\\\infty \\\\bar{n}_{\\\\bar{x}} + \\\\bar{\\\\phi}_{\\\\bar{y}} \\\\bar{n}_{\\\\bar{y}} + \\\\bar{\\\\phi}_{\\\\bar{z}} \\\\bar{n}_{\\\\bar{z}} = 0 \\\\quad \\\\mbox{(on body surface)} This is the incompressible potential-flow problem about the transformed \\\\bar{x}\\\\bar{y}\\\\bar{z} geometry. It can be solved by incompressible methods, such as thin airfoil theory, vortex lattice methods, panel methods, etc. The result is the transformed perturbation potential \\\\bar{\\\\phi} or its gradient components \\\\bar{\\\\phi}_{\\\\bar{x}}, \\\\bar{\\\\phi}_{\\\\bar{y}}, \\\\bar{\\\\phi}_{\\\\bar{z}} in the transformed space. The physical linearized pressure coefficient is then obtained by the inverse transformation :C_p= -2\\\\frac{\\\\phi_x}{V_\\\\infty} = -\\\\frac{2}{\\\\beta^2} \\\\frac{\\\\bar{\\\\phi}_{\\\\bar{x}}}{V_\\\\infty} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\beta^2} \\\\bar{C}_p which is known as G√∂thert's rule  Results  For two-dimensional flow, the net result is that C_p and also the lift and moment coefficients c_l, c_m are increased by the factor 1/\\\\beta: :\\\\begin{align} C_p &= \\\\frac{C_{p0}} {\\\\beta} \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_l &= \\\\frac{c_{l0}} {\\\\beta} \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_m &= \\\\frac{c_{m0}} {\\\\beta} \\\\end{align} where C_{p0}, c_{l0}, c_{m0} are the incompressible-flow values for the original (unscaled) xyz geometry. This 2D-only result is known as the Prandtl Rule. For three-dimensional flows, these simple 1/\\\\beta scalings do NOT apply. Instead, it is necessary to work with the scaled \\\\bar{x}\\\\bar{y}\\\\bar{z} geometry as given above, and use the G√∂thert's Rule to compute the C_p and subsequently the forces and moments. No simple results are possible, except in special cases. For example, using Lifting-Line Theory for a flat elliptical wing, the lift coefficient is :C_L = \\\\frac{2 \\\\pi \\\\alpha}{\\\\beta + 2/AR} where AR is the wing's aspect ratio. Note that in the 2D case where AR ‚Üí ‚àû this reduces to the 2D case, since in incompressible 2D flow for a flat airfoil we have c_{l0} = 2 \\\\pi \\\\alpha, as given by Thin airfoil theory.  Limitations  The PG transformation works well for all freestream Mach numbers up to 0.7 or so, or once transonic flow starts to appear.  History  Ludwig Prandtl had been teaching this transformation in his lectures for a while, however the first publication was in 1928 by Hermann Glauert. The introduction of this relation allowed the design of aircraft which were able to operate in higher subsonic speed areas. Originally all these results were developed for 2D flow. G√∂thert eventually realized in 1946 that the geometric distortion induced by the PG transformation renders the simple 2D Prandtl Rule invalid for 3D, and properly stated the full 3D problem as described above. The PG transformation was extended by Jakob Ackeret to supersonic-freestream flows. Like for the subsonic case, the supersonic case is valid only if there are no transonic effect, which requires that the body be slender and the freestream Mach is sufficiently far above unity.  Singularity  Near the sonic speed M_\\\\infty \\\\simeq 1 the PG transformation features a singularity. The singularity is also called the Prandtl‚ÄìGlauert singularity, and the flow resistance is calculated to approach infinity. In reality, aerodynamic and thermodynamic perturbations get amplified strongly near the sonic speed, but a singularity does not occur. An explanation for this is that the linearized small-disturbance potential equation above is not valid, since it assumes that there are only small variations in Mach number within the flow and absence of compression shocks and thus is missing certain nonlinear terms. However, these become relevant as soon as any part of the flow field accelerates above the speed of sound, and become essential near M_\\\\infty \\\\simeq 1. The more correct nonlinear equation does not exhibit the singularity.

Its headquarters staff is based at Stadtallendorf. It was created as 1st Airborne Division (1. Luftlandedivision) in 1956 and reflagged twice in 1994 and 2001 as Airmobile Forces Command/4th Division (Kommando Luftbewegliche Kr√§fte/4. Division), Special Operations Division and eventually Rapid Forces Division. The division leads three combat brigades and special forces troops, all of which are fully air-mobile. In June 2014, the Dutch 11 Airmobile Brigade was fully integrated into the division as part of the binational military cooperation between Germany and the Netherlands and in 2017 the Romanian 81st Mechanized Brigade followed suit.  History  Created in 1956, 1st Airborne Division's main tasks were to act as the backbone of counterattacks behind the enemy lines of the Warsaw Pact and to respond to hostile breaks through allied front lines. The very first commanders of this unit were illustrious paratrooper generals such as Bern von Baer and Hans Kroh, both recipients of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. The 1st Airborne Division existed throughout the Cold War and was disbanded in 1994. The capability for air-transportable forces was eventually replaced by Airmobile Forces Command/4th Division, a division-sized formation the duties of which shifted to more complex scenarios of current days. This happened mainly because of two incidents in 1994 and 1997 where German citizens had to be rescued from Rwanda and Albania, once even by foreign troops as the German military lacked of adequate forces to carry out evacuation operations on their own. One of the three existing brigades (Airborne Brigade 25 \\"Black Forest\\") was drawn on to provide the headquarters for the German Army's new special forces unit, the Kommando Spezialkr√§fte. The first overseas deployment of this division took place in 1961 when its troops rendered humanitarian assistance to Morocco after a devastating earthquake. From there on 1st Airborne Division or its successors deployed troops to Somalia, Croatia, Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Congo. The paratroopers saw extensive action in Afghanistan. With four of the nation's highest awards for gallantry‚Äîamong others‚Äîhaving been awarded to its members, the division's Paratrooper Battalion 263 is the most decorated unit of the German Army. Following the restructuring of the German armed forces, the Special Operations Division was transferred into the new Rapid Forces Division (). In June 2014 the 11 Luchtmobiele Brigade (11th Airmobile Brigade) of the Royal Netherlands Army joined the division. The Dutch forces will remain stationed in the Netherlands but will cooperate in training and exercises of their German counterparts.

He also served as military officer in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and the American Civil War. He was a son of famous explorer William Clark. Early life and career Clark was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Missouri and corps of discovery expedition leader, William Clark of Lewis and Clark fame. He was named after his father's friend and associate, Meriwether Lewis. In 1826, he was admitted to the United States Military Academy and graduated 23rd of 42 cadets in the Class of 1830. He was brevetted as a second lieutenant in the 6th U.S. Infantry and assigned to Jefferson Barracks in St. Louis. He served as an officer and mapmaker in the Black Hawk War before resigning from the army in 1833.Eicher, pp. 231‚Äì32. While on assignment in Louisville, Kentucky, Clark met and courted Abigail Prather Churchill [born 1817], of the prominent Churchill family [Her younger brother was Arkansas Governor Thomas James Churchill (1824-1905)]. They married in January 1834 and raised seven children before her death in 1852. Their son Meriwether Lewis Clark Jr. would become a prominent member of Louisville society, promoting horseracing and building, with help from his Churchill relations, the famous racetrack Churchill Downs. As a designer-architect, Clark contributed to the early architecture of St. Louis, including the design of St. Vincent de Paul Roman Catholic Church. In 1836, he was elected to the Missouri General Assembly. Four years later, he was named as the city engineer of St. Louis and later was the recorder of the city court.Christensen, pp. 188‚Äì89. During the Mexican War in 1846, Clark resumed his military career as a major in the Missouri volunteers, serving as the commander of an artillery battalion with 3 companies of light artillery. He participated in the Battle of the Sacramento River near Chihuahua City under overall command of Colonel Alexander Doniphan on February 28, 1847. After the Mexican-American War, Clark returned to St. Louis and was the Federal surveyor-general for Missouri and Illinois until 1853. Civil War service In early 1861, Clark, strongly pro-secessionist in his political views, was appointed by Governor Claiborne F. Jackson to organize recruits from the Ninth District of Missouri. He received an appointment as a brigadier general of the Ninth Division of the Missouri State Guard, but the unit was never formally organized during his tenure, partially because of the very strong pro-Union sentiment in St. Louis. Clark resigned from the Guard in November 1861 and was replaced by Daniel M. Frost. He then accepted a commission as a major of artillery in the Confederate States Army. He was promoted to colonel and assigned to various staff positions; including as Chief of Artillery of the Army of Mississippi under General Braxton Bragg. Disagreement with the later led to his dismissal from the position. He then served in the Ordnance Department in Richmond, Virginia, until November 1864 when he assumed command of a brigade of Virginia Reserve Forces in the Army of Northern Virginia under Robert E. Lee. During the Appomattox Campaign, he was taken prisoner at the Battle of Sayler's Creek near Amelia Courthouse, Virginia, on April 6, 1865. Postbellum career After the war, Clark moved to Louisville, Kentucky, and resumed his engineering career. He married Jula Davidson on December 30, 1865. He was the lead architect on the design and construction of several state buildings in Kentucky. He later was the commander of cadets at the Kentucky Military Institute. Clark died in Frankfort, Kentucky, in 1881. He is buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri.

Life and career  After his studies in history, germanistics, philosophy and Protestant religion in Frankfurt am Main, Mainz, G√∂ttingen and Marburg he started a career as a grammar school teacher. In 1963 he awarded his doctor in philosophy with the theme: ‚ÄúDie Grafschaft B√ºdingen im Feld der Auseinandersetzungen um die religi√∂se und politische Einheit des Reiches 1517‚àí1555‚Äú (The County B√ºdingen in the field of conflicts on religious and political unity of the realm 1515‚àí1555).http://d-nb.info/458777978 Between 1966 and 1971 he was in charge of the constitution and direction of the evening grammar school in Wiesbaden. In these politically turbulent times he very early campaigned for this new German ‚Äúsecond-chance or adult education‚Äù and for the democratisation in school and along with this the student council. Since 1965 until 1973 contemporaneous with the above mentioned function he got involved as an active member in the Wiesbaden Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and he published a work on the history of the 100-year-existence of the party in their festschrift. In 1977 after his activities in the SPD, Michaelis was cofounder of a local political party ‚ÄúFreie W√§hlergemeinschaft‚Äù (FWG) (free voters union) of Wiesbaden and also member in the ‚ÄúFrankfurt round table‚Äù, a political, economic and liberal club for discussions with very important persons (VIPs). In context with his long-time work in the Protestant church he campaigned also for the ecumenism of church very soon and took part in 1968 on the 4th plenum of the ecumenical World Council of Churches in Uppsala. In 1976 he joined the club: ‚ÄúBr√ºderlicher Kreis‚Äù (brother circle), a Christian religious open community with Protestant imprint, which has its origin in the confraternity of Baltic States, founded 1926. After his retirement in 1982 he was engaged in the constitution and management of the archive from the ‚ÄúDeutscher Sch√ºtzenbund‚Äù (German Shooting Sport Federation) in Wiesbaden, which is the head organisation for German Sch√ºtzenverein. During this time he wrote more than ten papers about the historical background of the German Sch√ºtzenverein and organised several expositions. Since his early days Michaelis was interested in genealogy. On the basis of already available information and documents regarding several branches of his family he travelled to different regions of Germany and overseas in order to complete these data. Thus it was possible to generate a databank with more than 10,000 persons of the corresponding families Michaelis, von Boehmer, Von G√∂rschen and Weitbrecht. In context with these searches he published more than 50 essays and papers including their historic circumstances and backgrounds. On the basis of these researches he could prove that all descendants in direct line of his grand-grandmother Mary Barbara Rennie (1836‚àí1920) from the Rennie-Clan of Kilsyth, are also direct descendants from the pilgrims father William Bradford (1590‚àí1657). Therewith the mentioned persons are eligible for membership in the traditional and renowned the Mayflower society based in Plymouth, Massachusetts.

The United Kingdom has an embassy in Copenhagen and Denmark has an embassy in London. Both countries are full members of Council of Europe and NATO. History Middle Ages Gunboat War The Battle of Copenhagen, 1801. The long decades of peace came to an abrupt end during the Napoleonic Wars. Britain felt threatened by the Armed Neutrality Treaty of 1794, which originally involved Denmark and Sweden, and later Prussia and Russia. The British fleet attacked Copenhagen in 1801 (Battle of Copenhagen (1801)), destroying much of Denmark's navy. Denmark nonetheless managed to remain uninvolved in the Napoleonic Wars until 1807. The British fleet bombarded Copenhagen again that year, causing considerable destruction to the city. They then captured the entire Danish fleet so that it couldn't be used by France to invade Britain (as the French had lost their own fleet at Trafalgar in 1805), leading to the Gunboat War (1807‚Äì1814). The confiscation of the Danish navy was widely criticised in Britain. In 1809 Danish forces fighting on the French side participated in defeating the anti-Bonapartist German rebellion led by Ferdinand von Schill, at the Battle of Stralsund. By 1813, Denmark could no longer bear the war costs, and the state was bankrupt. When in the same year the Sixth Coalition isolated Denmark by clearing Northern Germany of French forces, Frederick VI had to make peace. Accordingly, the unfavourable Treaty of Kiel was concluded in January 1814 with Sweden and Great Britain, and another peace was signed with Russia in February. The Treaty of Kiel transferred Heligoland to Great Britain and Norway from the Danish to the Swedish crown, Denmark was to be satisfied with Swedish Pomerania. But the Norwegians revolted, declared their independence, and elected crown-prince Christian Frederick (the future Christian VIII) as their king. However, the Norwegian independence movement failed to attract any support from the European powers. After a brief war with Sweden, Christian had to abdicate in order to preserve Norwegian autonomy, established in a personal union with Sweden. In favour of the Kingdom of Prussia, Denmark renounced her claims to Swedish Pomerania at the Congress of Vienna (1815), and instead was satisfied with the Duchy of Lauenburg and a Prussian payment of 3.5 million talers, also, Prussia took over a Danish 600,000 talers debt to Sweden. Relations between the two countries were normalised as the nineteenth century progressed and they have remained cordial. Cooperation Danish forces fought alongside British forces in operations in Iraq and they continue this cooperation today in Afghanistan. Denmark and United Kingdom work closely together on counter-terrorism issues. State visits HM Queen Margrethe II of Denmark paid state visits to the United Kingdom in April/May 1974, and in February 2000. HM Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom paid state visits to Denmark in May 1957, and in May 1979. On 19 August 2010, Danish Prime Minister Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen visited London, to visit British Prime Minister, David Cameron.

They possessed two rows of rectangular, interlocking osteoderms like those of terrestrial crocodilymorphs like atoposaurids, that are relatively simple, do not extend far in their necks, as opposed to the ornate armours of modern crocodilians; likewise, unlike modern crocodilians but like many extinct forms like phytosaurs, they have ventral osteoderms as well. Their forelimbs are also proportionally very long, particularly in the humeri and wrist bones, being as long or longer than the hindlimbs, the opposite of the condition seen in modern crocodilians. Some like Anteophthalmosuchus also have forwardly oriented eyes, as opposed to the dorsally oriented eyes seen in modern forms.

Henry Singleton (19 October 1766 ‚Äì 15 September 1839) was an English painter and miniaturist. The Ale-House Door, circa 1790. Family life Henry Singleton was born in London, England, into an artistic family. He was not yet two years old when his father died, so he was raised by his uncle William Singleton (d. 1793), who had studied under the tutelage of Ozias Humphry and painted portraits and miniatures. Another uncle, Joseph Singleton, exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1773 and 1788. Henry‚Äôs sisters Maria and Sarah (later Macklarinan) were miniaturists who exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1808 to 1820 and from 1787 to 1806 respectively. In 1807 Henry married his cousin William Singleton‚Äôs only daughter. Henry Singleton died in London at the age of 72, at the house of a friend at 7 Kensington Gore, and was buried in the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields. Work Although Singleton, like his uncles and sister, also painted miniatures, he did not adhere strictly to the genre. He exhibited at the Royal Academy, between 1784 and 1839, approximately 300 works, a large proportion of which were portraits, with scriptural subjects making up much of the remainder. He was for many years the Royal Academy's oldest living exhibitor. His works were also exhibited at the British Institution from 1806 and at the Society of British Artists from 1824 until his death in 1839. From the age of sixteen, Singleton worked as a professional portraitist. He attended the Royal Academy Schools from the age of seventeen and won the silver medal in 1784. His painting from John Dryden‚Äôs ode Alexander‚Äôs Feast won the gold medal in 1788. In 1793, Singleton was commissioned by the Royal Academy to paint a group portrait of forty of the academicians. Ironically, he never became a member or an associate of the Academy himself. Early in his career, Singleton was noted for large compositions from the Bible, Shakespeare or contemporary historical events. Although his portrait work was always in demand, he never achieved the great success as a historical painter that his early promise indicated. Lord Nelson, Admiral Vernon, Lord Howe and John \\"Mad Jack\\" Fuller are among his portrait sitters. Paul I Granting Liberty to Ko≈õciuszko (1797) and The Death of Captain Alexander Hood after Capturing the French 74 \\"L'Hercule\\", 21 April 1798 are considered by some to be his best works. Shortly before his death, Singleton completed a series of cabinet pictures to illustrate the works of Shakespeare. Henry Singleton‚Äôs works are currently in the collections of the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the National Portrait Gallery (London), the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Tate Britain, the Ulster Museum, the Royal Institution and the Brighton Art Gallery.

Lying some southwest of Randolph on Big Creek, it was inhabited about 1875-1915\\\\. History Around 1875, John Kennedy, Sr. (the great-grandfather of David M. Kennedy) settled the area with his three sons (one of whom, John Kennedy, Jr. later served in the Utah State legislature), who built homes and ranches along the various branches of Big Creek. Within a few years several other Mormon families moved in and established a local church group. The town became known as Kennedyville. In 1885 the community organized a school system, and the mostly Scottish American residents voted to rename the town Argyle in honor of Argyll, Scotland. School was originally held in Kennedy's home until a one- room brick schoolhouse was built in 1895. The cold climate made farming difficult, and the population grew slowly. There were 111 inhabitants in 1900, and just over 125 in 1910 when a second room was built onto the schoolhouse. Argyle declined as transportation improved and farmers no longer had to live as close to their fields. The school was considered inferior to the education available in nearby Randolph, and Argyle had no stores or other services of its own. In 1913 the local church organization was discontinued, and in 1915 the school itself closed and merged with the one in Randolph. Most of the residents moved to Randolph and kept their farms in the Argyle area. Although the town is deserted, numerous buildings and walls still stand at Argyle. It is surrounded by hay fields and closed to the public, but the ruins can easily be seen from the road.

Common cargoes were bricks, timber, cattle, sheep, and other bulk raw materials downriver, and finished goods up. Gundalows were very active delivering cordwood to brickworks to fire their kilns, picking up cargoes of finished bricks in return. A form of sailing barge similar to a scow, gundalows were fitted with a pivoting leeboard in lieu of a fixed keel, giving them an exceptionally shallow draft and allowing them to \\"take the hard\\" (settle into sand, ledge, or mudflats) both for loading and unloading cargoes and maintenance. A gundalow's yard was attached to a stump mast and heavily counterweighted, pivoting down while still under sail to shoot under bridges while maintaining the boat's way.

In the 17th century, there were many Danish students in medicine, law, philosophy and theology in France, while in Denmark there were many French tutors. Ingeborg, daughter of Valdemar I of Denmark, was queen consort of France (1193 & 1200-1223). Scanian War Embassy of Denmark in Paris The Scanian War (1675-1679) was a part of the Northern Wars involving the union of Denmark-Norway, Brandenburg and Sweden. It was fought mainly on Scanian soil, in the former Danish provinces along the border with Sweden and in Northern Germany. While the latter battles are regarded a theater of the Scanian war in English, Danish and Swedish historiography, they are seen as a separate war in German historiography, called the Swedish-Brandenburgian War. The war was prompted by the Swedish involvement in the Franco-Dutch War. Sweden had allied with France against several European countries. The United Provinces, under attack by France, sought support from Denmark-Norway. After some hesitation, King Christian V started the invasion of the Scania (Sk√•neland) in 1675, while the Swedish were occupied with a war against Brandenburg. The invasion of Scania was combined with a simultaneous Norwegian front called the Gyldenl√∏ve War, forcing the defending Swedes to fight a two-front war in addition to their entanglements in the Holy Roman Empire. The Danish objective was to retrieve the Scanian lands that had been ceded to Sweden in the Treaty of Roskilde, after the Northern Wars. Although the Danish offensive was initially a great success, Swedish counter-offensives led by the 19-year-old Charles XI of Sweden nullified much of the gain. It was a war with no definite victor; the Swedish navy lost at sea, the Danish army was defeated in Scania by the Swedes, who in turn were defeated in Northern Germany by the Brandenburgers. The war and the hostilities ended when Denmark's ally the United Provinces settled with Sweden's stronger ally France and the Swedish king Charles XI married Danish princess Ulrike Eleonora, sister of Christian V. Peace was made on behalf of France with the treaties of Fontainebleau and Lund and Saint Germain, restoring most of the lost territories to Sweden.The Scanian War 1675-79 . Educational site for high schools created by Oresundstid. War of the Sixth Coalition In the War of the Sixth Coalition (1812‚Äì1814), a coalition of Austria, Prussia, Russia, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and a number of German States finally defeated France and drove Napoleon Bonaparte into exile on Elba. After Napoleon's disastrous invasion of Russia, the continental powers joined Russia, Britain, Portugal and the rebels in Spain. With their armies reorganized along more Napoleonic lines, they drove Napoleon out of Germany in 1813 and invaded France in 1814, forcing Napoleon to abdicate and restoring the Bourbons.

It was the only part of Abkhazia under Georgian control before this military conflict. On 9 August 2008, the Abkhaz military, with support by Russian forces, launched an operation to remove the remaining Georgian troops from the disputed gorge. After three days, the Georgian military left the Upper Kodori Valley. Abkhaz and Russian army mobilization Russia sent naval vessels to blockade Georgia's Black Sea coast. According to the Russian navy, a group of ships from Russia's Black Sea Fleet, including the flagship Moskva missile cruiser, arrived on 10 August 2008 near the Georgian border. The source in the Russian Navy's headquarters claimed, that \\"the purpose of the Black Sea Fleet vessels' presence in this region is to provide aid to refugees.\\" A spokesman of the president of Abkhazia earlier said, that \\"the local administration and peacekeepers had asked Russia to reinforce its naval presence near the Abkhazian coast, after Georgian warships attempted to approach the coastline.\\" On 10 August 2008, the Georgian government said that 6,000 Russian troops had rolled into South Ossetia from the neighbouring Russian province of North Ossetia and 4,000 more landed in Abkhazia. Alexander Novitsky, an aide to the commander of Russian peacekeepers in Abkhazia, said on 11 August 2008, that Russia had boosted its forces in Abkhazia and had more than 9,000 paratroopers and 350 armoured vehicles there. Ultimatum to Georgia On the morning of 9 August 2008, the Abkhaz de facto deputy defense minister requested, that UNOMIG should withdraw its observers from the Upper Kodori Valley. UNOMIG then withdrew all 15 observers from the Upper Kodori Valley. The Abkhaz de facto authorities announced a decision, taken by president Bagapsh, to expel the Georgian armed forces from the Upper Kodori Valley. On the afternoon, UNOMIG reported aerial bombardments of Georgian villages in the Upper Kodori Valley. On 10 August, the president of Abkhazia, Sergei Bagapsh, gave a press conference where he announced that their operation in the Upper Kodori Valley was proceeding according to plan. He gave both Georgian civilians and armed personnel an ultimatum to leave the Upper Kodori Valley. He also said, that the government of Abkhazia had requested Russia to take measures to strengthen the Abkhaz maritime border. Bagapsh said, that his decision to start a military operation against the Upper Kodori Valley was approved by the parliament. Fighting On 9 August 2008, Russian- supported separatists in Abkhazia launched air and artillery strikes to drive Georgian troops out of the Kodori gorge, the only part of Abkhazia controlled by Georgia before this war. A \\"second front\\" against Georgia was opened. The Itar-Tass news agency quoted the foreign minister of Abkhazia Sergei Shamba as saying that the armed forces of Abkhazia had begun an operation to force Georgian troops out of the upper part of the Kodori gorge. In a separate report by Interfax news agency, Sergei Bagapsh said, that its \\"aviation is currently conducting an operation in the upper part of the Kodori gorge of Abkhazia controlled by Georgia.\\" Shamba also said, \\"Today was only the initial part of the operation by heavy artillery supported by aviation.\\" Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili was quoted by the Itar-Tass agency as saying that Georgia had defeated all attacks on the upper part of the Kodori gorge. On 10 August Abkhaz warplanes and artillery continued to pound Georgian positions for a second day in a row. Bagapsh said, Abkhazia was acting \\"independently\\". The separatist authorities of Abkhazia announced a full military mobilisation. The president of Abkhazia said, that \\"around 1,000 special Abkhaz troops\\" were involved in operations against Georgian forces. They were attacking the Georgians using \\"warplanes, multiple rocket launchers and artillery.\\" \\"The operation will enter the next phase as planned. And you will learn about that,\\" he said, adding that he would create a \\"humanitarian corridor\\", allowing residents to flee. On 11 August 2008, the Abkhaz defense minister, Mirab Kishmaria, told the Russian news agency Interfax, that Abkhaz forces would kill Georgian troops, if they did not leave Kodori gorge. On 12 August 2008, Abkhaz authorities announced a military offensive against Georgian troops in the Kodori gorge. Russian forces supported the Abkhaz operation. \\"The operation to liberate Kodori gorge has started,\\" Abkhazia's foreign minister, Sergei Shamba, said. \\"Our troops are making advances. We are hoping for success.\\" Shamba claimed, that Russian troops were not involved in the operation. Georgian military left the gorge on 12 August 2008. Georgia's Deputy Interior Minister, Eka Zhguladze, said, that Georgian troops had withdrawn from the Kodori gorge as a \\"goodwill gesture.\\" Abkhaz Deputy Defense Minister, Major General Anatoly Zaitsev, claimed, that \\"only local forces - not Russian ones\\" were involved in the military operation. But an AP reporter in the area saw 135 Russian military vehicles driving to the Kodori gorge. Georgian officials said, their troops in the Kodori gorge were being attacked by Russians. On 13 August 2008, president Sergei Bagapsh flew into the gorge by helicopter to declare, that the last piece of Georgian-held land in Abkhazia was back under the control of the separatist authorities. Abkhaz soldiers said, that they had discovered a \\"mountain of weapons\\", from American M-16 rifles to artillery units and mortars, as well as herds of abandoned cattle. Casualties and war damages One Abkhaz soldier was mistakenly killed by his own men. Two Georgian soldiers were also killed. Before the war, around 2,000 people lived in the Upper Kodori Valley, that fled during the Georgian retreat. The Abkhaz authorities said that they advised the return of the refugees, but by late March 2009, only 130 people were reported to live in the Upper Kodori Valley. According to visitors to Azhara, military posts had been damaged and shops looted, but houses were almost unharmed. Operations outside Abkhazia The Russian ultimatum, issued on 11 August 2008 by the commander of Russian peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia, Major General Sergei Chaban, called for Georgian troops to disarm in the Zugdidi district along the boundary with Abkhazia. Russia stated, the ultimatum expired at 06:00 GMT. Sergei Chaban said, that the Russian troops were ready for an operation to disarm Georgian troops in the area. On 11 August 2008, Russian paratroopers, deployed in Abkhazia, occupied the city of Zugdidi and carried out raids against military bases deep in western Georgia. That day, Russian forces, meeting virtually no resistance, entered the town of Senaki and seized the military base. Georgian Deputy Defense Minister Batu Kutelia said, that about 30 armored personnel carriers and more than 20 trucks with Russian soldiers entered Senaki and took control of the military base. Russian Defense Ministry announced that \\"operations\\" were carried out in Senaki. \\"Operations aimed to prevent new attack of Georgian artillery against peacekeepers of Russia and South Ossetia,\\" the report said. The source insisted that they aimed to prevent mobilization of reservists. Shota Utiashvili, spokesman for Interior Ministry of Georgia said, that Russian peacekeepers and Abkhaz separatists had entered Khurcha village of Zugdidi District. Abkhaz separatists declined the information. An aide to the commander of Russian forces, Alexander Novitsky, said, that during a reconnaissance mission, the Russian Air Force destroyed two Georgian helicopters at the Senaki airbase. The helicopters were purportedly identified as a MI-8 and a MI-24, belonging to the Georgian Air Force. Russians destroyed the base in Senaki, and seized rich trophies. On 12 August 2008, Russian troops also drove through the port of Poti and took up positions around it. On 16 August 2008, the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, that the Russian army units and the separatists moved the border of Abkhazia in direction to the Inguri River. The troops occupied 13 villages in Georgia, set up temporary administration there and put the Inguri River hydropower plant under the separatist control.

In 2010, the Denmark‚ÄìUSA/Canada Program was launched. The programme aims the internationalization of Danish education programmes. Hans Island Hans Island is a small, uninhabited barren knoll measuring , located in the centre of the Kennedy Channel of Nares Strait. The island is claimed by both Canada and Greenland with the Kingdom of Denmark. In 1973 Canada and the Kingdom of Denmark ratified a treaty defining the border in the area. The treaty did not define the border at Hans Island as no agreement was made on this. In 1984, Tom H√∏yem, the Danish Minister for Greenland, raised the Danish flag on the island. On 25 July 2005, Canadian Defence Minister Bill Graham visited the island, the visit sparked anger in Denmark. The Government of Denmark sent a letter of protest to Canada. Canada also sent two warships in 2005 to Hans Island, and . On 19 September 2009, both governments put in place a process to end the dispute. In January 2011, both countries were close to a resolution over the island. However, the border agreement signed in November 2012 did not contain a solution to the dispute, and as of 2020 no agreement has been made about the island.

They mostly live in Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. New Denmark is a Canadian rural community in Victoria County, New Brunswick. The community derives its name from several Danish settlers who inhabited the area in 1872, eventually forming the largest and what would become the oldest Danish community in Canada; the Danish influence has diminished somewhat in recent decades due to out-migration.

History In the 1890s, there was no trade between Australia and Denmark, so in the 1920s, the Danes in Australia formed the Danish-Australian Chamber of Commerce to import products from Denmark such as Tuborg, Junket and Hirschsprung cigars. On 1 May 1952, an agreement on visas was signed in Canberra. In the 1980s, after the visit of Uffe Ellemann-Jensen to Australia, the relations between Australia and Denmark was described as warm and friendly. In 2010, both countries made a deal to ship 6,100 ton hexachlorobenzene waste from Australia to Denmark. Greenpeace protested outside the Australian environment ministry to show their opposition to the shipment of Hexachlorobenzene from Australia.

Java is in front, Falstria in the middle, and Jutlandia at the rear. When North Korean communist forces attacked South Korea on June 25, 1950, Denmark agreed to provide assistance to the UN and to give humanitarian support to the allied forces in South Korea. The decision was not uncomplicated: the mood between the superpowers were extremely tense, and Denmark had to find a way to support the UN without being aggressive. Almost instantly, medical supplies were made available, and after negotiations Denmark also agreed to send a hospital ship. In the fall of 1950, East Asiatic Company again agreed to place the ship at the disposal of the Danish Government, whilst it was en route to New York City.The Danish Hospital Ship: Jutlandia On January 23, 1951 she was sent to Korea. She sailed under 3 flags: Dannebrog, the Red Cross, and the UN flag. The day before the departure, she was visited by King Frederik and Queen Ingrid. Denmark undertook the refitting of MS Jutlandia as a modern hospital ship, and consigned it to Korea. She had four operation theatres, four hospital departments with up to 356 beds, X-ray eye and dental clinics as well as laboratories, dispensary and special departments.

They suggested that the defense industries of Korea and Denmark design their future with a strategy to develop a market while reducing investment costs, because of the small domestic market, they have to pioneer the global market. Korea and Denmark signed a memorandum of understanding on cooperation with the defense industry and military service in May 2011 to establish a cooperative channel for the defense industry. At a briefing session of defense companies, South Korea's Company 'Hunid Technology' and Denmark's company 'Systematic' signed a memorandum of understanding for business cooperation and strengthened cooperation between them.

Education  The use of Lego in education Lego was first introduced in Korea in 1984, and Lego education systems have been introduced in Korea since 1995. In 2001, the corporate ALKO proposed the establishment of the Lego Education center in Korea to the Denmark Lego Company, and succeeded in pilot operation. Currently, there are about 140 centers in the Korea. The Lego Education Center is a place where children can learn about the typical education system of the Danish Lego Company and can receive creativity, concentration and robot education using Lego education products. Although it is Denmark that produces Lego toys, Korea has brought along Lego from Denmark to develop education programs in Korea's creative way. The year 2009 marked the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between Denmark and Korea. In honor of this, Lego created toy towers to prove that the two countries are in a friendly relationship, and donated them to children's organizations through Lego Education. Danish Education Minister Bethel Harder and Korean national assembly Park Young-sun built Lego bricks with children at the Shindorim Lego Education Center in Seoul on August 25. They delivered messages of congratulations and experienced learning to build creativity and expression while building cars, animals with Lego bricks.

Background In the aftermath of World War II, religious existence came under fire from communist governments in Eastern Europe and China. Although some priests have since been exposed as collaborators, both the Church's official resistance and the leadership of Pope John Paul II are credited with helping to bring about the downfall of communist governments across Europe in 1991. The Church policies after World War II under Pope Pius XII focused on material aid to war-torn Europe, an internal internationalization of the Roman Catholic Church and the development of its worldwide diplomatic relations. His encyclicals, Evangelii praecones and Fidei donum, issued on June 2, 1951 and April 21, 1957, respectively, increased the local decision-making of Catholic missions, many of which became independent dioceses. Pius XII demanded recognition of local cultures as fully equal to European culture.Audience for the directors of mission activities in 1944 A.A.S., 1944, p. 208.Evangelii praecones. p. 56. While the Church thrived in the West and most of the developing world, it faced most serious persecutions in the East. The communist regimes in Albania, Bulgaria, and Romania practically eradicated the Roman Catholic Church in their countries. The difficult relations of the Vatican with the Soviet Union, alias Russia, originated in the revolution in 1917 and continued through the pontificate of Pius XII. They affected relations with the Orthodox Church as well. The Catholic Oriental Churches were eliminated in most parts of the Soviet Union during the Stalinist era. Persecutions of the Church continued during the pontificate of Pope Pius XII. The relations of the Holy See with China from 1939‚Äì1958. began hopefully with the long withheld recognition of Chinese rites by the Vatican in 1939, the elevation of the first Chinese cardinal in 1946, and the establishment of a local Chinese hierarchy. It ended with the persecution and virtual elimination of the Catholic Church in the early Fifties, and the establishment of a Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association in 1957 Pius XII invoked ex cathedra papal infallibility by defining the dogma of the Assumption of Mary, as proclaimed in the Apostolic constitution Munificentissimus Deus. His communications include almost 1,090 addresses and radio broadcasts. His forty-one encyclicals, include Mystici corporis, the Church as the Body of Christ; Mediator Dei on liturgy reform; Humani generis on the Church's position on theology and evolution. He eliminated the Italian majority in the College of Cardinals with the Grand Consistory in 1946. Despite of all these and other modernization measures, which had taken place during the pontificate of Pius XII, Pope John XXIII felt the time had come to open the windows of the Church and to restate the ancient truths of the Church in a more contemporary language. Vatican II Sessions Preparations for the Council, which took more than two years, included work from 10 specialized commissions, along with people for mass media and Christian Unity, and a Central Commission for overall coordination. These groups, composed mostly of members of the Roman Curia, produced 987 proposed constitutions and decrees (known as schemata) intended for consideration by the Council. It was expected that these groups would be succeeded by similarly constituted commissions during the Council itself that would carry out the main work of drafting and reviewing proposals before presentation to the Council as a whole for review and expected approval; what happened, however, was that every single schema was thrown out in the first session of the Council, and new ones were created.Cath. Encyclopedia 1967, p. 563 The general sessions of the Council were held in the autumns of four successive years (in four periods) 1962 through 1965. During the rest of the year special commissions met to review and collate the work of the bishops and to prepare for the next period. Sessions were held in Latin in St. Peter's Basilica, with secrecy kept as to discussions held and opinions expressed. Speeches (called interventions) were limited to ten minutes. Much of the work of the council, though, went on in a variety of other commission meetings (which could be held in other languages), as well as diverse informal meetings and social contacts outside of the council proper. Two-thousand nine-hundred and eight (2,908) men (referred to as Council Fathers) were entitled to seats at the council. These included all bishops from around the world, as well as many superiors of male religious institutes. 2,540 took part in the opening session, making it the largest gathering in any council in church history. (This compares to Vatican I where 737 attended, mostly from Europe.)Sullivan 2002, p.21 Attendance varied in later sessions from 2,100 to over 2,300. In addition, a varying number of periti (Latin for \\"experts\\") were available for theological consultation‚Äîa group that turned out to have a major influence as the council went forward. Seventeen Orthodox Churches and Protestant denominations sent observers.\\"Vatican Council II\\", New Catholic Encyclopedia, vol. XIV, p. 563 More than three dozen representatives of other Christian communities were present at the opening session, and the number grew to nearly 100 by the end of the 4th Council Session. The Catholic Church engaged in a comprehensive process of reform following the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì65).Duffy, Saints and Sinners (1997), p. 270‚Äì6 Intended as a continuation of Vatican I, under Pope John XXIII the council developed into an engine of modernisation. It was tasked with making the historical teachings of the Church clear to a modern world, and made pronouncements on topics including the nature of the church, the mission of the laity and religious freedom. The council approved a revision of the liturgy and permitted the Latin liturgical rites to use vernacular languages as well as Latin during mass and other sacraments. Efforts by the Church to improve Christian unity became a priority.Duffy, Saints and Sinners (1987), p. 274 In addition to finding common ground on certain issues with Protestant churches, the Catholic Church has discussed the possibility of unity with the Eastern Orthodox Church. Post-conciliar developments Liturgy reforms Changes to old rites, ceremonies and church architecture following Vatican II stunned many Catholics, who spoke of it as Wreckovation. Some stopped going to church, while others tried to preserve the old liturgy with the help of sympathetic priests.Bokenkotter, A Concise History of the Catholic Church (2004), p. 410 The latter formed the basis of today's Traditionalist Catholic groups, which believe that the reforms of Vatican II have gone too far in departing from traditional church norms, particularly with regard to changes made to the Mass. Liberal Catholics form another dissenting group. They typically take a less literal view of the Bible and of divine revelation, and sometimes disagree with official Church views on social and political issues. The most famous liberal theologian of recent times has been Hans K√ºng, whose unorthodox views of the incarnation, and his denials of infallibility led to Church withdrawal of his authorization to teach as a Catholic in 1979.Bauckham, Richard, in New Dictionary of Theology, Ed. Ferguson, (1988), p. 373 In his book A Concise History of the Catholic Church, professor Thomas Bokenkotter commented on the situation by stating \\"Most Catholics, however, accepted the changes more or less gracefully but with little enthusiasm and have learned to take in stride the continuing series of changes that have modified not only the Mass but the other sacraments as well.\\" In 2007, Benedict XVI reinstated the old mass as an option, to be celebrated upon request by the faithful.Apostolic Letter \\"Motu Proprio data\\" Summorum Pontificum on the use of the Roman Liturgy prior to the reform of 1970 (July 7, 2007) The scholar Romano Amerio, author of Iota Unum, is widely regarded today as having written one of the most detailed accounts of changes and issues in the post-Conciliar Church.Chiesa article Liberation theology In the 1960s, growing social awareness and politicization in the Latin American Church gave birth to liberation theology. It re‚Äìinterpreted the Gospel in radical ways that redefined the Church's mission. Peruvian priest, Gustavo Guti√©rrez, became one of the movement's better-known scholars. A meeting of Latin American bishops in 1968, charged with the implementation of Vatican II, led to the new movement growing increasingly influential. In 1979, the subsequent bishops' conference in Mexico officially declared the Latin American Church's \\"preferential option for the poor\\". Salvadoran Archbishop √ìscar Romero became the region's most famous contemporary martyr in 1980, when he was murdered while saying mass by forces allied with the government.For more on Romero, by a former colleague, see Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI have denounced the movement as dangerous and \\"a fundamental threat to the faith of the church\\" Benedict's main involvement in dealing with liberation theology was while he was still Cardinal Ratzinger. because, as Edward Norman explains, the Church considers it an attempt to establish a Christian society \\"through the coercive machinery of political management\\".Norman, The Roman Catholic Church an Illustrated History (2007), pp. 176‚Äì7 The Brazilian theologian Leonardo Boff was twice ordered to cease publishing and teaching. While Pope John Paul II was criticized for his severity in dealing with proponents of the movement, he maintained that the Church, in its efforts to champion the poor, should not do so by resorting to violence or partisan politics. The movement is still alive in Latin America today, though the Church now faces the challenge of Pentecostal revival in much of the region.For liberation theology's persistence, see For the threat from Pentecostalism, see Humanae Vitae The sexual revolution of the 1960s brought challenging issues for the Church. Pope Paul VI's 1968 encyclical Humanae Vitae affirmed the sanctity of life from conception to natural death and rejected the use of contraception; both abortion and euthanasia were considered to be murder.Norman, The Roman Catholic Church an Illustrated History (2007), p. 184 The Church's rejection of the use of condoms has provoked criticism, especially with respect to countries where AIDS and HIV have attained epidemic proportions. The Church maintains that countries like Kenya, where behavioral changes are endorsed instead of condom use, have experienced greater progress towards controlling the disease than countries solely promoting condoms. Role of women Efforts in support of the Catholic ordination of women led to a ruling against it in 1976 by the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (Declaration on the Question of the Admission of Women to the Ministerial Priesthood). Pope John Paul II later issued two documents to explain Church teaching. Mulieris Dignitatem was issued in 1988 to clarify women's equally important and complementary role in the work of the Church.Bokenkotter, A Concise History of the Catholic Church (2004), p. 467 Then in 1994, Ordinatio Sacerdotalis explained that the Church only extends ordination to men in order to follow the example of Jesus, who chose only men for this specific duty.Pope Benedict XVI, Jesus of Nazareth (2008), pp. 180‚Äì1, quote: \\"The difference between the discipleship of the Twelve and the discipleship of the women is obvious; the tasks assigned to each group are quite different. Yet Luke makes clear‚Äîand the other Gospels also show this in all sorts of ways‚Äîthat 'many' women belonged to the more intimate community of believers and that their faith‚Äîfilled following of Jesus was an essential element of that community, as would be vividly illustrated at the foot of the Cross and the Resurrection.\\" The group Roman Catholic Womenpriests began performing ordination ceremonies for women in 2002, the validity of which is nonexistent, as the Church has issued orders of excommunication for any and all participants, invalidating any Sacraments issued by them. Capital punishment John Paul II then set the Church in opposition to capital punishment when he issued Evangelium Vitae in 1995. Explaining that execution was appropriate when it was the only way to defend society, the pope noted that the modern penal system made this option rare or nonexistent. However this statement of the Pope also in the Catechism is a prudential judgement thus Catholics may have a legitimate diversity of opinion on this.Worthiness to Receive Holy Communion. N.p., n.d. Web. 05 June 2017. . On 2 August 2018, it was announced that the Catechism of the Catholic Church would be revised to state that the Church teaches that \\"the death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person\\". A full letter to the bishops regarding the change stated that it was consistent with the previous teachings of the Catholic Church regarding the dignity of human life, and that it reflected how modern society had better prison systems with a goal of criminal rehabilitation that made the death penalty unnecessary for the protection of innocent people. Within two weeks, 45 Catholic scholars and clergy signed an appeal to the cardinals of the Catholic Church, calling on them to advise Pope Francis to retract the recent revision made to the Catechism, on the grounds that its appearance of contradicting scripture and traditional teaching is causing scandal. US sex abuse cases Mainly in the United States, several major lawsuits emerged in 2001 claiming that priests had sexually abused minors.Bruni, A bible of Shame (2002), p. 336 Some priests resigned, others were defrocked and jailed and financial settlements were agreed with many victims. In the US, where the vast majority of sex abuse cases occurred, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops commissioned a comprehensive study that found that four percent of all priests who served in the US from 1950 to 2002 faced some sort of sexual accusation. Further, the Church was widely criticized when it emerged that some bishops had known about abuse allegations, and reassigned many of the accused after first sending them to psychiatric counseling, instead of removing them.Steinfels, A People Adrift (2003). pp. 40‚Äì6Frawley-ODea, Perversion of Power: Sexual Abuse in the Catholic Church (2007), p. 4 Some bishops and psychiatrists contended that the prevailing psychology of the times suggested that people could be cured of such behavior through counseling. Pope John Paul II responded by declaring that \\"there is no place in the priesthood and religious life for those who would harm the young\\".Walsh, John Paul II: A Light for the World (2003), p. 62 The US Church instituted reforms to prevent future abuse by requiring background checks for Church employees; and, because the vast majority of victims were teenage boys, the worldwide Church also prohibited the ordination of men with \\"deep‚Äìseated homosexual tendencies\\". It now requires dioceses faced with an allegation to alert the authorities, conduct an investigation and remove the accused from duty. In 2008, Cardinal Cl√°udio Hummes, head of the Vatican Congregation for the Clergy, affirmed that the scandal was an \\"exceptionally serious\\" problem, but estimated that it was \\"probably caused by 'no more than 1 per cent'\\" of the over 400,000 Catholic priests worldwide. Some commentators, such as journalist Jon Dougherty, have argued that media coverage of the issue has been excessive, given that the same problems plague other institutions such as the US public school system with much greater frequency. Benedict XVI With the election of Pope Benedict XVI in 2005, the Church saw so far largely a continuation of the policies of his predecessor, John Paul II, with some notable exceptions. Benedict decentralized beatifications, and reverted the decision of his predecessor regarding papal elections.Moto Proprio, De Aliquibus Mutationibus, June 11, 2007 In 2007 he set a Church record by approving the beatification of 498 Spanish Martyrs. His first encyclical Deus caritas est discussed the nature of love and how it informs one's participation in a just society.Deus caritas est In an address at the University of Regensburg, Germany,Quoted as Benedict XVI, Meeting with the representatives of science in the Aula Magna of the University of Regensburg (September 12, 2006), Vatican, 2006. source: Benedict maintained that in the Western world, to a large degree, only positivistic reason and philosophy are valid. Yet the world's profoundly religious cultures see this exclusion of the divine, as an attack on their most profound convictions. A concept of reason which excludes the divine, is incapable of entering into the dialogue of cultures, according to Benedict.Benedict XVI, Meeting with the representatives of science in the Aula Magna of the University of Regensburg (September 12, 2006) During this Regensburg address Benedict quoted a Byzantine emperor who said Muhammad had brought the world only things \\"evil and inhuman\\". After the Pope explained his quote, the dialogue continued, with cordial meetings of Islam representatives in Turkey, and the ambassadors of Muslim countries in 2007. A May 2008 declaration agreed on between Benedict and Muslims, led by Mahdi Mostafavi, stressed that religion is essentially non-violent and that violence can be justified neither by reason nor by faith. Pope Benedict has spoken out against human rights abuses in China, Darfur, and Iraq and encouraged protection of the environment and the poor. He spoke strongly against drug dealers in Latin America and Catholic politicians supporting abortion laws. Ethical rulings In 2007, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith clarified the Catholic Church's position vis-a-vis other Christian communities. Quoting the statement of Pope Paul VI: \\"What the Church has taught down through the centuries, we also teach: that there is only one Church\\", the Vatican insisted that while communities separated from the Catholic Church can be instruments of salvation, only those with apostolic succession can be properly termed \\"churches\\". Some Protestant representatives were not surprised; others announced themselves insulted by the document, which also stressed the Church's commitment to ecumenical dialogue. A Church official told Vatican radio that any dialogue is facilitated when parties are clear about their identity. Important ethical decisions during the pontificate of Benedict XVI involved continued nutrition and hydration for persons in a vegetative status. While making many exceptions, the Church ruled that \\"the provision of water and food, even by artificial means, always represents a natural means for preserving life.\\"United States Conference of Catholic Bishops ...

History The ping- pong argument goes back to late 19th century and is commonly attributed to Felix Klein who used it to study subgroups of Kleinian groups, that is, of discrete groups of isometries of the hyperbolic 3-space or, equivalently M√∂bius transformations of the Riemann sphere. The ping-pong lemma was a key tool used by Jacques Tits in his 1972 paperJ. Tits. Free subgroups in linear groups. Journal of Algebra, vol. 20 (1972), pp. 250‚Äì270 containing the proof of a famous result now known as the Tits alternative. The result states that a finitely generated linear group is either virtually solvable or contains a free subgroup of rank two. The ping-pong lemma and its variations are widely used in geometric topology and geometric group theory.

Formal statements Ping-pong lemma for several subgroups This version of the ping-pong lemma ensures that several subgroups of a group acting on a set generate a free product. The following statement appears inAndrij Olijnyk and Vitaly Suchchansky. Representations of free products by infinite unitriangular matrices over finite fields. International Journal of Algebra and Computation. Vol. 14 (2004), no. 5-6, pp. 741-749; Lemma 2.1, and the proof is from. Let G be a group acting on a set X and let H1, H2,...., Hk be nontrivial subgroups of G where k‚â•2, such that at least one of these subgroups has order greater than 2. Suppose there exist pairwise disjoint nonempty subsets X1, X2,....,Xk of X such that the following holds: *For any i‚â†s and for any h‚ààHi, h‚â†1 we have h(Xs)‚äÜXi. Then :\\\\langle H_1,\\\\dots, H_k\\\\rangle=H_1\\\\ast\\\\dots \\\\ast H_k. =Proof= By the definition of free product, it suffices to check that a given (nonempty) reduced word represents a nontrivial element of G. Let w be such a word of length m\\\\geq 2 , and let : w= \\\\prod_{i=1}^m w_{i}, where w_{i}\\\\in H_{\\\\alpha_i} for some \\\\alpha_i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\dots,k\\\\\\\\} . Since w is reduced, we have \\\\alpha_i eq \\\\alpha_{i+1} for any i=1,\\\\dots,m-1 and each w_i is distinct from the identity element of H_{\\\\alpha_i} . We then let w act on an element of one of the sets X_i . As we assume that at least one subgroup H_i has order at least 3, without loss of generality we may assume that H_1 has order at least 3. We first make the assumption that \\\\alpha_1 and \\\\alpha_m are both 1 (which implies m\\\\geq 3 ). From here we consider w acting on X_2 . We get the following chain of containments: : w(X_2) \\\\subseteq \\\\prod_{i=1}^{m-1} w_{i}(X_1) \\\\subseteq \\\\prod_{i=1}^{m-2} w_{i}(X_{\\\\alpha_{m-1}})\\\\subseteq \\\\dots \\\\subseteq w_1(X_{\\\\alpha_2}) \\\\subseteq X_1. By the assumption that different X_i 's are disjoint, we conclude that w acts nontrivially on some element of X_2 , thus w represents a nontrivial element of G . To finish the proof we must consider the three cases: *if \\\\alpha_1 = 1,\\\\,\\\\alpha_m eq 1 , then let h\\\\in H_1\\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{w_{1}^{-1},1\\\\\\\\} (such an h exists since by assumption H_1 has order at least 3); *if \\\\alpha_1 eq 1,\\\\,\\\\alpha_m=1, then let h\\\\in H_1\\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{w_{m},1\\\\\\\\} ; *and if \\\\alpha_1 eq 1,\\\\,\\\\alpha_m eq 1, then let h\\\\in H_1\\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{1\\\\\\\\} . In each case, hwh^{-1}after reduction becomes a reduced word with its first and last letter in H_1. Finally, hwh^{-1}represents a nontrivial element of G, and so does w. This proves the claim. The Ping-pong lemma for cyclic subgroups Let G be a group acting on a set X. Let a1,...,ak be elements of G of infinite order, where k ‚â• 2. Suppose there exist disjoint nonempty subsets :X1+,...,Xk+ and X1-,...,Xk- of X with the following properties: *ai(X ‚àí Xi-) ‚äÜ Xi+ for i = 1, ..., k; *ai‚àí1(X ‚àí Xi+) ‚äÜ Xi- for i = 1, ..., k. Then the subgroup H = 1, ..., ak> ‚â§ G generated by a1, ..., ak is free with free basis {a1, ..., ak}. =Proof= This statement follows as a corollary of the version for general subgroups if we let Xi= Xi+‚à™Xi‚àí and let Hi = ‚ü®ai‚ü©. Examples Special linear group example One can use the ping-pong lemma to prove that the subgroup H = ‚â§SL(2,Z), generated by the matrices :\\\\scriptstyle A=\\\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 &1 \\\\end{pmatrix} and \\\\scriptstyle B=\\\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 &1 \\\\end{pmatrix} is free of rank two. =Proof= Indeed, let H1 = and H2 = **be cyclic subgroups of SL(2,Z) generated by A and B accordingly. It is not hard to check that A and B are elements of infinite order in SL(2,Z) and that : H_1=\\\\\\\\{A^nn\\\\in \\\\mathbb Z\\\\\\\\}=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2n\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} : n\\\\in\\\\mathbb Z\\\\right\\\\\\\\} and :H_2=\\\\\\\\{B^nn\\\\in \\\\mathbb Z\\\\\\\\}=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 2n & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} : n\\\\in\\\\mathbb Z\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Consider the standard action of SL(2,Z) on R2 by linear transformations. Put :X_1=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{pmatrix}x \\\\\\\\\\\\ y \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\in \\\\mathbb R^2 : x>y\\\\right\\\\\\\\} and :X_2=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{pmatrix}x \\\\\\\\\\\\ y \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\in \\\\mathbb R^2 : x<y\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. It is not hard to check, using the above explicitly descriptions of H1 and H2 that for every nontrivial g ‚àà H1 we have g(X2) ‚äÜ X1 and that for every nontrivial g ‚àà H2 we have g(X1) ‚äÜ X2. Using the alternative form of the ping-pong lemma, for two subgroups, given above, we conclude that H = H1‚àóH2. Since the groups H1 and H2 are infinite cyclic, it follows that H is a free group of rank two. Word- hyperbolic group example Let G be a word-hyperbolic group which is torsion- free, that is, with no nontrivial elements of finite order. Let g, h ‚àà G be two non-commuting elements, that is such that gh ‚â† hg. Then there exists M‚â•1 such that for any integers n ‚â• M, m ‚â• M the subgroup H = n, hm> ‚â§ G is free of rank two. =Sketch of the proofM. Gromov. Hyperbolic groups. Essays in group theory, pp. 75-263, Mathematical Sciences Research Institute Publications, 8, Springer, New York, 1987; ; Ch. 8.2, pp. 211-219.= The group G acts on its hyperbolic boundary ‚àÇG by homeomorphisms. It is known that if a ‚àà G is a nontrivial element then a has exactly two distinct fixed points, a‚àû and a‚àí‚àû in ‚àÇG and that a‚àû is an attracting fixed point while a‚àí‚àû is a repelling fixed point. Since g and h do not commute, the basic facts about word-hyperbolic groups imply that g‚àû, g‚àí‚àû, h‚àû and h‚àí‚àû are four distinct points in ‚àÇG. Take disjoint neighborhoods U+, U-, V+ and V- of g‚àû, g‚àí‚àû, h‚àû and h‚àí‚àû in ‚àÇG respectively. Then the attracting/repelling properties of the fixed points of g and h imply that there exists M ‚â• 1 such that for any integers n ‚â• M, m ‚â• M we have: *gn(‚àÇG - U-) ‚äÜ U+ *g‚àín(‚àÇG - U+) ‚äÜ U- *hm(‚àÇG - V-) ‚äÜ V+ *h‚àím(‚àÇG - V+) ‚äÜ V- The ping-pong lemma now implies that H = n, hm> ‚â§ G is free of rank two. Applications of the ping-pong lemma *The ping-pong lemma is used in Kleinian groups to study their so-called Schottky subgroups. In the Kleinian groups context the ping-pong lemma can be used to show that a particular group of isometries of the hyperbolic 3-space is not just free but also properly discontinuous and geometrically finite. *Similar Schottky-type arguments are widely used in geometric group theory, particularly for subgroups of word- hyperbolic groups and for automorphism groups of trees.Alexander Lubotzky. Lattices in rank one Lie groups over local fields. Geometric and Functional Analysis, vol. 1 (1991), no. 4, pp. 406-431 *Ping-pong lemma is also used for studying Schottky-type subgroups of mapping class groups of Riemann surfaces, where the set on which the mapping class group acts is the Thurston boundary of the Teichm√ºller space.Richard P. Kent, and Christopher J. Leininger. Subgroups of mapping class groups from the geometrical viewpoint. In the tradition of Ahlfors-Bers. IV, pp. 119-141, Contemporary Mathematics series, 432, American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2007; ; 0-8218-4227-7 A similar argument is also utilized in the study of subgroups of the outer automorphism group of a free group.M. Bestvina, M. Feighn, and M. Handel. Laminations, trees, and irreducible automorphisms of free groups. Geometric and Functional Analysis, vol. 7 (1997), no. 2, pp. 215-244. *One of the most famous applications of the ping-pong lemma is in the proof of Jacques Tits of the so-called Tits alternative for linear groups. (see also Pierre de la Harpe. Free groups in linear groups. L'Enseignement Math√©matique (2), vol. 29 (1983), no. 1-2, pp. 129-144 for an overview of Tits' proof and an explanation of the ideas involved, including the use of the ping-pong lemma). *There are generalizations of the ping-pong lemma that produce not just free products but also amalgamated free products and HNN extensions. These generalizations are used, in particular, in the proof of Maskit's Combination Theorem for Kleinian groups.Bernard Maskit. Kleinian groups. Grundlehren der Mathematischen Wissenschaften [Fundamental Principles of Mathematical Sciences], 287. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1988. ; Ch. VII.C and Ch. VII.E pp.149-156 and pp. 160-167 *There are also versions of the ping-pong lemma which guarantee that several elements in a group generate a free semigroup. Such versions are available both in the general context of a group action on a set,Pierre de la Harpe. Topics in geometric group theory. Chicago Lectures in Mathematics.

He was born in Norton St Philip, Somerset and died at Bath, Somerset. A right-handed opening batsman, Angell made a lot of runs in club cricket for the Lansdown Cricket Club in Bath, but his record in first-class cricket was less successful. He played for Somerset in matches at Bath in both 1947 and 1948, and in a few more games in 1949, before joining the county club's staff in 1950. Playing mostly as the opening partner to the ebullient Harold Gimblett, Angell was a restrained, neat batsman and made 933 runs in his first full season, though his average was only 20 and he passed 50 only three times. There was a very similar record in 1951, with 975 runs, again at an average of 20. In 1952, Angell made his highest score of 90 in the match against Derbyshire at Derby. But three weeks later he was dropped from the side and, as Somerset hit the bottom of the County Championship table for what would prove to be the first of four consecutive last-place finishes, he was not re-engaged at the end of the 1952 season. In 1954, however, with Gimblett retiring suddenly at the start of the season, Angell was recalled to Somerset and proceeded to have his best season in first-class cricket. He scored 1,125 runs at an average of 22.95 and made his highest score (and only first-class century) of 114 in the match against the Pakistanis. Apart from this innings, his highest score for the season was an unbeaten 62. He was less successful again in 1955, and after seven matches in 1956 he left the staff for good. He continued to be a heavy scorer in club cricket into his late 40s. By profession, he was an engineering draughtsman for a Bath company. He died on 9 October 2014.

It is native to all of northern and western Europe, ranging south to the Maghreb. North of the Alps its range extends eastwards to Siberia and Kazakhstan. Possibly and most likely introduced populations are found in Asia Minor and North America, respectively.Bugguide.net. It is the type species of its genus (Enarmonia), and by extension of the tribe Enarmoniini of subfamily Olethreutinae.Baixeras et al. (2009a) The wingspan is 15‚Äì19 mm. The adult moths fly from May to October in the temperate parts of the range (e.g. Belgium and the Netherlands). The caterpillars feed on the bark of woody Rosaceae of subfamily Amygdaloideae, namely hawthorns (Crataegus), apples (Malus), cherries (Prunus) and pears (Pyrus). In particular, they have been notedGrabe (1942) to forage at canker lesions. They prefer mature trees. The larvae produce a reddish frass at the entrance to their tunnel. Signs of larval feeding can be seen at cracks in the bark, or at joints with branches. The larva pupates at the entrance to its tunnel, often enclosed by frass secured with silk.

The earliest item featuring the name Fuck the Facts is from 1998. They began in the late nineties as a solo recording project constructed by musician Topon Das. After many early recordings, including split tapes with groups from around the world, Fuck the Facts began developing a name in the underground with fans of grind. In 2001, the first full-length CD-R, Discoing the Dead, was recorded. The same year, Das would assemble a full band to continue with the project. The band has since coined the terms \\"bastardized grindcore\\" and \\"mullet-core\\" to describe their sound. History Formation (1998‚Äì2001) Fuck the Facts began early in 1997 as an unnamed recording project by Topon Das. The project remained nameless until featured on a compilation in 1998, where Topon decided upon the name Fuck the Facts after a song from the first Naked City album. A self-titled cassette was released on Topon's own Dedfuk Records that compiled all of the recordings made since the projects‚Äô inception. Fuck the Facts then released split cassettes with Cult of the Damned, Longdreamdead and S.M.E.S. before releasing another full-length cassette entitled Vagina Dancer in September 2000 on Slovak label Where Late The Birds Sang. Vagina Dancer showcased a more experimental, noise side to Fuck the Facts than the self-titled release which featured more of a grindcore style. Discoing the Dead, Mullet Fever (2001‚Äì2002) Fuck the Facts Mullet Fever lineup ca. 2001. Left to right, Topon Das, Brent Christoff, Matt Connell, Tim Audette. With the two full length tapes, and the various splits, Fuck The Facts started to gain notoriety in the underground noise and grindcore world. The next full length, Discoing the Dead, was recorded in 2000 and released on Ghetto Blaster Recordings (another label run by Topon) on February 6, 2001. Positive feedback with this release motivated Topon to continue Fuck the Facts as a full band. Drummer Matt Connell and guitarist Tim Audette joined in late February. The three recorded music for a split with Ames Sanglates, before the addition of vocalist Brent Christoff in April and bassist Shomir Das in May. In May 2001, the band recorded and released Four0ninE, an EP which featured a cover of The Beach Boys song \\"409.\\" Shomir left the band after only three days, but the band continued on as a four piece performing their first live show on August 4, 2001 in Melbourne, Quebec. Regular performances around Ontario and Quebec continued until the fall when the band decided to record a full-length release. Before the end of 2001, the new Fuck the Facts lineup would release Mullet Fever, the full length follow- up to Discoing the Dead. Mullet Fever, with its catchphrase \\"37 songs in 35 minutes,\\" featured a more punk influenced grindcore sound, though still retained some of the noise influence. Backstabber Etiquette, Splits (2002‚Äì2003) In early 2002, following the recording of Mullet Fever, Fuck the Facts parted ways with vocalist Brent Christoff. Soon after, a replacement was found in Mel Mongeon. While Mel had made a guest appearance on a previously recorded split, her first recording as a member of the band was a re-recording of the song \\"The Burning Side\\" for the Goreland compilation CD released by Black Hole Productions (the song was originally featured on Discoing the Dead performed by entirely by Topon). Since joining the band, Mel has done most of the artwork for Fuck the Facts releases. The summer of 2002 saw the band expand their touring area reaching as far west as Winnipeg, and including a December tour of the Maritimes. The touring, along with the release of a split with Sylvester Staline, helped expand their fanbase overseas. The summer of 2002 also saw the release of Escunta, the long-awaited noise follow-up to Vagina Dancer, on Mandarangan Recordings. Escunta had been recorded from late 1999 to early 2000 before Topon had assembled the band, but its release had been delayed until now. Following the winter Maritime tour, Fuck the Facts recorded their next full-length album entitled Backstabber Etiquette. It was released in early 2003 on Grind It! Records (a sublabel of Great White North Records). This new release featured a matured sound that incorporated progressive death metal elements to an already expanding sound. After the release of Backstabber Etiquette, more touring ensued. This proved to be too demanding for guitarist Tim Audette. Tim parted ways with the band in June 2003 following a Maritime tour. The band continued as a three-piece and recorded a series of three splits with Feeble Minded, Sergent Slaughter and Subcut respectively. While recording the material for these splits, guitarist Dave Menard joined the band and brought new inspiration. However, the split with Subcut would be the last recording with drummer Matt Connell who felt it was time to part ways with the band. Legacy of Hopelessness (2004‚Äì2006) Shortly after Matt's departure, local drummer Tim Olsen was brought in as a replacement. Also around that time, Marc-Andr√© Mongeon was brought as a bassist (the first since Shomir had left the band in 2001). As a five-piece, the band toured throughout the summer of 2004 across Canada. By the time mid-2005 came around, the constant touring proved to be too much for Marc and Dave and they decided to step down. Mathieu Vilandr√© and Steve Chartier (aka Esteve Decalisse) were brought on guitar and bass respectively just in time for touring in support of Fuck the Fact's next release, Legacy of Hopelessness. This six-song EP had been recorded in the fall of 2004 and was co-released in June 2005 through Topon's Ghetto Blaster Recordings and Steve's label Capital Kill. A much more experimental release, Legacy of Hopelessness featured more electronic and ambient elements combined with the usual Fuck the Facts grindcore sound. The summer support tour for the EP took the band all the way from Sydney, Nova Scotia to Vancouver, British Columbia. Collection of Splits, Stigmata High-Five (2006‚Äì2007) Fuck the Facts performing live in 2007. Left to right, Topon Das, Mathieu Vilandr√©, Mel Mongeon. Upon return from the Legacy of Hopelessness tour, Mathieu Vilandr√© and Steve Chartier were brought into the band as permanent members. It was at this time that the band recorded a two-song pre-production demo as an indicator of the direction the band would be taking for their next album. These demos were eventually released on two splits (with Pleasant Valley and Mesrine), and were used to look for a possible record deal. At the start of 2006, Tim Olsen was asked to leave the band. Mathieu Vilandr√©, who had previously filled in on drums, took over the position permanently and recording began for the next full-length album in February. Early in the recording process, the band was contacted by Relapse Records and secured a three-album deal with them that would start with their next album. In the interim, the Collection of Splits 2002-2004 was released by Great White North Records which exposed fans to some of the band's music that was more difficult to acquire due to limited pressings. It included all of the material from the splits released between Backstabber Etiquette and Legacy of Hopelessness (with Subcut, Sergent Slaughter, Feeble Minded and Sylvester Staline) as well as enhanced MP3 tracks from some earlier splits. The summer of 2006 was filled with tours of the Maritimes, North-Eastern United States (including a performance at the New England Doom and Grind Festival), Ontario and Quebec. In August 2006, Stigmata High-Five was released on Relapse Records. The album highlighted not just a change in musical direction, but also a development in the recording quality. For the first time, the band had enlisted a separate producer to help them forge their sound and went to a professional studio to record.\\"This is actually the first time we‚Äôve left our basement to go record somewhere else and do it properly.\\" Exclaim article Following the release of Stigmata High-Five, the band filmed a music video, featuring local actors Adam Steptoe, Luke Williams, and Eugene Swain, for the song \\"The Sound of Your Smashed Head\\" on location in London, Ontario, Canada, and spent seven weeks in the US touring, including a slot on the Relapse Contamination Festival before returning home to start a three-week tour of Ontario and Quebec which ended in November. Constant touring continued into early 2007 with a Maritime tour in March. A two-week tour followed that took the band down to Texas and back up to Canada in time for another tour of Ontario. The band decided to take a break in June to begin work on their next album. Disgorge Mexico (2007‚Äì2009) Following the final Stigmata High- Five tour in June 2007, the band parted ways with bassist Steve Chartier \\"for reasons that aren't that uncommon of why bands and people split.\\"Entry dated 2008-04-24 The band then spent two weeks going on a road trip to Mexico and back to write the material for their next album. The album was tracked that August; however, immediately following that, the three remaining members decided that it was time to take a break. With no plans, the completion of the next album was questionable. At this point, the band still remained somewhat silent on their situation; however, by January 2008, they were back performing again. The touring, along with some personal issues, slowed the mixing and mastering progress of the album, however by April it was announced that Disgorge Mexico would be released in North America on July 22, 2008 as the band's second Relapse Records release. The band celebrated the album's release with a free CD release party in which they performed the entire CD from start to finish on August 2 in Hull, Quebec. In 2009, Fuck the Facts embarked on their first ever European tour. Polish Relapse Records label mates Antigama and Dutch grindcore band Dr. Doom joined Fuck the Facts for the tour which lasted from February 12 to March 3, 2009. In an interview, Topon noted the irony that the band was only now finding its way to Europe considering that many of their earlier releases (up to a decade earlier) were on European labels. Late in 2009, the band announced that touring bassist Marc Bourgon had become a full-time member of the band. Marc had been touring with the band since January 2008, and had recorded with the band on their latest split with Leng Tch'e. Unnamed EP and Die Miserable (2010‚Äìpresent) In late 2009, the band announced that the following year would see the release of a new EP, their first video release, and a new full-length album. In late February 2010, they released Unnamed EP having been recorded by the band and featuring artwork created and printed by the band. Many reviewers lauded the band for their \\"do it yourself\\" ethic. In early March, the band left for Europe on their Unnamed European Tour 2010 including a few countries they had yet to visit such as Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Upon returning to North America, the band completed work on their first video release, Disgorge Mexico: The DVD. The DVD combined a live performance of their 2008 album Disgorge Mexico with a short art film made by Canadian filmmaker David Hall that used the album as its soundtrack. A bonus DVD featuring a plethora of other videos was also included in limited numbers. Fuck the Facts released Die Miserable on October 11, 2011, on Relapse Records. The band begun recording the album in January 2010, but put it on hold to go on various tours and release their EP and DVD. The album was nominated for a Juno Award for best heavy metal/hard rock album for 2012, but lost to KEN Mode's Venerable. A companion EP, Misery, was released the same day by the band. Fuck the Facts released the EP Amer on June 18, 2013. The band released a new EP, Abandoned, on October 1, 2014. Musical style Fuck the Facts has had three different vocalists, all with their own style and impact on the sound of the band. The first recordings up until Discoing the Dead feature only Topon on vocals (aside from a few guest appearances). His singing varies between deep growls and more high pitched screams. The Mullet Fever lineup features Brent Christoff who has a slightly deeper, more grunting sound. The biggest change is with the replacement of Brent with Mel Mongeon who has a very distinctive high-pitched shriek which has become the vocal style that the band is most known for. Most (if not all) Fuck the Facts songs are played on guitars tuned down a fourth (B E A D F# B). Bass tuning is the same (B E A D), though depending on the performer, sometimes a 5 string bass is used. Common grindcore elements such as blast beats are also present. Generally, most of the songs feature the darker modes such as Aeolian, Phrygian, Locrian and heavy use of the tritone, though many songs feature other more chromatic scales as well. Different textures are used to create different moods. For example, a common feature will be the use of clean guitar within the context of a grindcore song that creates a radical change in the sound of the piece (an example would be the last half of Gated Community from Mullet Fever). Despite these few generalities, the musical style of the band has changed over the years. Early period Topon has stated numerous times that the name Fuck the Facts was chosen, in part, as a statement about his attitude towards the music he wrote. He tried not to feel hampered by genre labels, and that is reflected in the musical style. The earlier Fuck the Facts recordings up until approximately 2000 featured a combination of grindcore and noise. Though those two genres were prominent during this era of recording, many other styles crept into the music as well including death metal, crust punk, electronic and even as some as diverse as disco and jazz. When Discoing the Dead was released in early 2001, it retained many of these experimental styles, paving the way for the beginning of the first incarnation of Fuck the Facts as a full band. In addition to the grindcore style of the recordings, there were also many songs that were almost straight noise recordings. Vagina Dancer and Escunta, recorded in 2000 and 2001 respectively, are the core of these noise recordings, with some other tracks being featured on various compilations and splits. Mullet Fever was released in 2002 and featured a more punk-influenced grindcore sound. However, many of the songs included more experimental (for grindcore) styles including rap, hip-hop, jazz, noise and electronic. The album was largely recorded in one session of the band recording their own jam session and some minimal editing afterwards, and may explain why this album stands out on its own in terms of musical style and scope. Middle period When Backstabber Etiquette was recorded in 2002, vocalist Mel Mongeon had replaced Christoff, and her distinctive growl was markedly different than Brent's deep sound. Mel's higher pitched scream became the norm for the band. The musical style became more heavily influenced by death metal and showed more technical aspirations. This style persisted over the splits recorded between Backstabber Etiquette and Legacy of Hopelessness (these recordings are largely what make up the tracks on the Collection of Splits 2002-2004). Legacy of Hopelessness showcased a bit of a departure for the band in that it had a lot more electronic influences. Keyboards are featured on nearly every track, and are sometimes the primary focus. Of course, grindcore is still quite present as well as Mel's distinctive vocals. The change in musical style can probably be attributed to this being initially intended to be a solo release by Topon, but was migrated over to the band when it was realized that another full-length release was not quite feasible. Later period Stigmata High-Five represents the latest musical style of the band. The grindcore and death metal elements are still present, but so are more progressive and experimental ideas mixed with metalcore elements. The album contains longer songs with more intricate riffs and atypical time signatures. For example, the opening song \\"La Derni√®re Image\\" moves from groove-oriented grindcore based around a repeating clave rhythm with odd meters interspersed throughout (the clave rhythm and odd meters are both basic musical features of much progressive rock). A middle section counters that with more ambient textures and clean guitars. Disgorge Mexico contains shorter songs than Stigmata High-Five but retains a similar overall musical style. In some cases, the experimental ideas are expanded further to the point where one track contains a section that is reminiscent of straight ahead jazz and contains a high register melodic bass solo typical of jazz or fusion. Rhythmic elements often featured in progressive rock are still present, and metric dissonance via polyrhythms are often present.

Lived her early years in Le√≥n, Nicaragua. She was 3 years old when her family moved to the neighborhood of Subtiava,http://www.manfut.org/leon/sutiava.html in the outskirts of Leon. Her birthday coincides with the anniversary of the Somoza's National Guard massacre on college students marching on the streets of Leon in 1959. This is, each birthday of her life was a reminder of Students Martyrs, for it was a day off in schools in Nicaragua by decree. She lived in Managua between age six and ten. In 1962 her family moved to the town of Jinotega. On Sunday family outings visited San Rafael del Norte and other surrounding towns in the mountains that witnessed Gen. Augusto C√©sar Sandino saga in the 1930s. Education Returning to Managua, finished Elementary and High school at the French School of the Sacred Heart between 1965 and 1972,oblatas the same school attended by prominent personalities in Nicaragua today including ex-President of Nicaragua, Violeta Chamorro.Oblatas, Cien A≈àos, Idania, Fundadoras, ...Violeta Chamorro,etc.... (Note:Idania, Far right, second row in the picture) From Catholic to revolutionary Idania developed organizational and leadership skills as a member of the group \\"Las Metanoias\\"Maryknoll in senior high school. The group made spiritual retreat trips to hacienda El Tepeyac, near Mombacho Volcano and Lake Nicaragua for study and discussions on the liberation theology. Idania turned an ardent activist and represented her school among a broad base of organizations engaged in demonstrations demanding the release of political prisoners in 1971-1972\\\\. Her activities won her a slap on the face from Sister Nicolle, the school Director, who actually feared for Idania's fate.oblatas El Tepeyac In 1973, her family moved to Panama and she started her college education in Economics at the University of Panama. Resumed activism joining the Solidarity Committees in support of the Sandinista Liberation Front prisoners. In 1974 she married David Miranda, a Panamanian‚ÄìNicaraguan student of Economics also. In August 1975 she gave birth to daughter Claudia, named after Claudia Chamorro another Sandinista fallen years earlier. Reunion with the Sandinista leadership Following the successful Sandinista operatives at the Chema Castillo's residence in the 1974 Christmas party with attendance of dictator Anastasio Somoza's elite, Idania had the opportunity she longed for so long. She was finally able to meet personally the Sandinistas she fought so hard for their release since her school days, upon their arrival to Panama. Because Idania had residence in Panama since 1973, and many friends, she helped in the logistics to provide accommodations and supplies to the Sandinistas; so much, that she donated her personal belongings (furniture, appliances, books, etc.) to the safe houses in Panama where the Sandinistas were staying. It did not take long for Idania to fit perfectly in the \\"organization\\" (as they used to call the Sandinista National Liberation Front in Panama where they enjoyed medium security environment. Idania was considered to participate in the spectacular raid at the National Government Palace in 1978, taking 3000 hostages, which resulted in the release of several Sandinistas in captivity. Ultimately; Dora Mar√≠a T√©llez was chosen, the only woman in the operative, named after Rigoberto L√≥pez P√©rez. Military training In 1978 following the popular insurrection in Monimbo, Masaya, 78), Idania decided to join full-time the ranks of the FSLN Command in Panama and Costa Rica, where she frequently met with members of the \\"Direccion Nacional\\", the highest ranking of that organization. She trained in Cuba in rocket launching in the middle of 1978. General Omar Torrijos, and the people of Panama, did not like the Somoza dictatorship and offered logistic support to the Sandinistas and also military training in the Province of Chiriqui (Panama) and she also trained there among other young cadres. Wounded in the Southern Front Idania wounded in the Southern Front, September 1978 Between 1975 and 1978 Idania made trips to Nicaragua and Costa Rica on clandestine missions, including one trip to the Northern Front and different operatives, but in September 1978 she was wounded in combat on the left hand in Nicaragua near the southern border. She was taken initially to a Costa Rican hospital near the border, and her pictures appeared in Costa Rican newspapers front page referring to her only as \\"Angela\\", respecting her identity. Fearing for her security at the Hospital, Sergio Ram√≠rez's wife picked her up and took her to a Sandinista makeshift hospital in Nicaragua near the border. Upon her return to Panama, the Panamanian military had assigned Secret Service security personnel to high ranking or identifiable Sandinistas including Idania. She could no longer use her real name or passport on her missions to Nicaragua either, or visit public places in Panama without escort. She was also required to carry a high caliber Magnum pistol in her purse at all times, which she did.Ramirez After a number of spontaneous uprisings in Monimbo, Matagalpa, Estel√≠ and other cities, where the Sandinistas were forced to fight in support of the people's uprising, rather than the opposite, a major shift in Sandinista strategy was developed. In order to take the lead of the Insurrection, two major Insurrectional Commands were organized; the Frente Interno in Managua and the Western command in the city of Leon. Idania was assigned to the newly formed Western Insurrectional Command, which required experience with the communities and base organizations (\\"trabajo de barrios\\"), worker unions, students, religious groups and organizing the neighborhoods for the final offensive. Plans for a final insurrection and a new government junta In February 1979, Omar Torrijos, head of the Panamenian government invited the Grupo de Los Doce, prominent Nicaraguan businessmen backing up the Sandinistas, for talks in Panama. By this time, arms shipments from Venezuela and Cuba were under way. Dr. Joaqu√≠n Cuadra, a member of Los Doce and whose son Joaqu√≠n Cuadra, leader of the Frente Interno Sandinista Command, was in Nicaragua, invited Idania and Oscar Perez Cassar for the talks and dinner. Idania and Oscar were also members of the Frente Interno, and scheduled to go back to Nicaragua via Honduras, to assume the leadership of the Western Regional Command for the final Insurrection. Sergio Ram√≠rez, also a member of Los Doce and a member of the upcoming Government Junta, relates that Idania attended with her hand still bandaged from surgery after her wounds in September. In March 1979, Idania went back to Nicaragua to resume her new post in the Western Regional Command, the leading Commando of the Insurrection, and was prepared to stay indefinitely until victory or death, as a member of the ill-fated Insurrectional Command \\"Rigoberto L√≥pez P√©rez\\" headed by Dora Mar√≠a T√©llez. In late 1978 the Somoza's National Guard had been killing the population without mercy in the towns of Leon, Masaya, Estel√≠ by aerial bombing, reported by the Red Cross.Genv. Conv. That was too much to bear for the Sandinistas. It was about time to finish the Somozas' regime.Ref. Univ. Of Minn. Genev. Conv. Red Cross The Swan Over the Burning Coals Title chosen by Sergio Ram√≠rez for the chapter of his book \\"Adios Muchachos\\" dedicated to the memory of the events the day that shook the entire city of Le√≥n, specially, and the rest of the country. On April 16, 1979 the Sandinista war was escalating fast. Combats were taking place in more than twenty cities in Nicaragua. However; most of the leaders of the soon to be Revolutionary Government were in Costa Rica or Panama in safe houses. Their role was to provide the military strategy, negotiations with foreign governments and sketching a plan for the new an imminent Nicaraguan Government Junta. The war was actually run in the field by five Regional Commands. The most important ones were the Western Command based in the City of Leon and the Frente Interno, based in Managua. They were considered critical for a fast victory. The Regional Commands had the future of Nicaragua at hand. On that day, the members of the Western Regional Command integrated by Oscar P√©rez Cassar, Idania Fernandez, Araceli P√©rez Darias, Ana Isabel Morales, Edgard Lang Sacasa, Roger Deshon Arg√ºello and Carlos Manuel Jarquin were in session in a safe house in the suburbs of Le√≥n. The National Guard was attacking heavily the City of Estel√≠, near the mountains and they were coordinating the efforts to help them. Reportedly, there was a whistleblower, a supposedly former Sandinista militia who turned police informant. The informant and eighty members of the National Guard, in jeeps and tanks, surrounded the block, and stormed into the house. The Sandinistas had no chance to escape or to grab their weapons. Ana Isabel put an apron on, grabbed a child form an adjacent house, and passed herself off as a domestic. She was the only survivor. The informant identified positively the men as important cadre, but he argued not knowing the women. So, all men were executed on the spot, Idania and Araceli were arrested, taken to the Fortin of Acosasco, tortured and murdered. Randall Interview Dora M Tellez Idania, Roger, Aracely, six important members The aftermath Thousands attended their funeral. The entire city of Le√≥n (not to mention the Sandinista ranks at all levels) was enraged. The Somoza government refused to return Araceli's (who was Mexican) remains to her family. Idania's parents and two youngest sisters were living in Dallas, Texas, and contacted the Dallas Morning News. The paper dedicated a full page article on the events in the Sunday edition. Edgard Lang Sacasa was 23 and he was the son of a first cousin to dictator Somoza and a friend of a Wall Street Journal columnist, and this prompted an editorial. Soon after, as expected, the city of Leon street fighters headed by Dora Mar√≠a T√©llez, Idania's comrade, increased greatly in numbers and firepower. In June the victory over the Somoza forces in Le√≥on was complete, followed by Managua, two weeks later, and the Somoza regime went with it.

Randall and many columnists' and editorial pages in Nicaragua countless times over the last twenty nine years.Rodriguez Ernesto Cardenal, Sergio Ramirez and other dissidents of the Sandinistas often quote Idania's writings and ideals. After her death, Idania firepower increased thousandfold. In 1984, at the peak of the Contra war, one of the largest battalions of the Sandinista Popular Army (Ej√©rcito Popular Sandinista), dispatched to the Northern Front to fight the Contras, was named after her. Occasionally, they name a nursery or police station after Idania but there are no monuments or statues for her in Nicaragua. She would probably have liked it this way.

It involved promising and then faking the over-fulfilment of the production plan for meat and milk in Ryazan oblast.  Context  On May 22, 1957, Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet leader at that time, made a speech at a regional meeting of Soviet agroindustry representatives, in which he aired his famous slogan \\"Catch up and overtake America\\" (–î–æ–≥–Ω–∞—Ç—å –∏ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–≥–Ω–∞—Ç—å –ê–º–µ—Ä–∏–∫—É). In this speech Khrushchev promised to overtake the United States in terms of major economic indicators and to complete building communism by 1980. One of the goals stated in this speech was to triple the amount of meat produced in the Soviet Union within the following three years. However, implementation of this goal remained far from the target. A year after the promise the production had not grown and the USSR was still experiencing food shortages. Khrushchev expressed his discontent and, towards the end of 1958, the Central Committee of CPSU issued a circular to obkoms, regional party committees on the oblast level, to take \\"decisive action\\" to ensure improvements in meat production in 1959.–°–æ–∫–æ–ª–æ–≤ –ê.–ö., –¢—è–∂–µ–ª—å–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ –í.–°. –ö–£–†–° –°–û–í–ï–¢–°–ö–û–ô –ò–°–¢–û–†–ò–ò 1941-1991  Affair  Alexei Larionov, the first secretary of the Ryazan Obkom (the effective head of the region in the Soviet system), announced a very ambitious goal of tripling the amount of meat produced in the region within the next year. The promise, in spite of being unrealistic, was confirmed at the regional party conference. On October 12, 1958, Larionov delivered the promise to Khrushchev in person, who became excited by the initiative.–í–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫ –∞—Ä—Ö–∏–≤–∞ –ø—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –†–§, –ñ—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª \\"–ò—Å—Ç–æ—á–Ω–∏–∫\\". On January 9, 1959, the promise was published in Pravda, the official party newspaper at the time. The publication was rushed by Khrushchev in spite of objections from the Agricultural Department of the Central Committee. The challenge was met by several other regions including Stavropol and Krasnodar. Even before starting its ambitious programme, the Ryazan region received several awards. In February 1959, the region was awarded with the Order of Lenin. In order to meet the promise, the region had to slaughter all the bovine herd of 1959, as well as a considerable part of its dairy stock. In addition, all cattle reared by kolkhoz farmers in their private households was appropriated \\"temporarily\\". As the collected amount was still not enough to meet the target, obkom had to buy meat in neighbouring regions by reallocating funds from other sources, such as the purchase of agricultural tools and construction. On December 16, 1959, Ryazan obkom was able to announce that the region delivered 150,000 tons of meat to the state, which was three times the amount delivered the previous year. On top of this, the regional authorities promised to deliver 180,000 in the next year.–≠–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—è ¬ª –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è ¬ª 11 –∫–ª–∞—Å—Å ¬ª –£—Ä–æ–∫ 51 On December 27, 1959, the success was announced by Khrushchev himself at the CPSU Plenum \\"On further development of agricultural production\\" (–û –¥–∞–ª—å–Ω–µ–π—à–µ–º —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∏—Ç–∏–∏ —Å–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–æ—Ö–æ–∑—è–π—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∞). Also in December, Larionov was awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labour. However, in 1960 production of meat in Ryazan oblast plummeted to 30,000 tons, since mass slaughter had reduced the number of cattle by 65% in comparison to the level of 1958. To make matters worse, kolkhoz farmers whose private cattle were \\"temporarily\\" appropriated the year before refused to process kolkhoz land. This halved the amount of grain produced in Ryazan oblast. By the fall of 1960, it became impossible to hide the affair. In September 1960, Larionov was dismissed from his post, stripped of the title of Hero of Labour. On October 10, 1960, he committed suicide.Tenure of RSFSR provincial party first secretaries. Russian archive from University of Manchester Aftermath Similar events happening on a smaller scale in other regions of the Soviet Union resulted in a statewide drop in agricultural production. Around the same time Khrushchev was obsessed with growing maize and forced its widespread planting. Some party leaders in North-West Russia and Baltic were also eager to report their following of the party line, even though maize does not grow well in northern regions. All these events gave a blow to Khrushchev's image in the Soviet Union. His slogan \\"Catch up and overtake America\\" was widely mocked in jokes. The events contributed to his final fall from power in 1964.

Baxkground Finasseur was bred by Edmond Blanc at his Haras de Jardy stud farm at Marnes-la-Coquette about sixteen kilometers west of central Paris and purchased for racing by Michel Ephrussi, a wealthy businessman connected to the Rothschild banking family of France. Ephrussi entrusted the colt's race conditioning to trainer James d'Okhuysen. Racing career Sent to race at age two, Finasseur notably won the 1904 Prix des Ch√™nes at Longchamp Racecourse in Paris. As a three- year-old, Finasseur was the dominant horse in French racing, winning the Prix du President de la Republique at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse, the then 1¬Ω mile French Derby at Chantilly Racecourse. He was ridden to victory by future United States Racing Hall of Fame inductee Nash Turner. An American, Turner came to France for fellow American owner/trainer H. Eugene Leigh and chose to make his permanent home there. Finasseur then won what was the most prestigious race in France at the time, the Grand Prix de Paris. His other major win came in the Grand Prix de Bruxelles at the Hippodrome de Boitsfort in the Boitsfort suburb of Brussels, Belgium. Stud career Retired to stud duty at his owner's Haras du Gazon in Normandy, Finasseur had only been bred to a few mares when he injured himself in his stall and broke a leg bone. The injury forced his owner to euthanize the valuable horse. Of note, a Finasseur filly named Stanzia was purchased in utero by Haras San Ignacio in Argentina. Her colt, Solpido, was a successful runner who broke several Argentinian time records.

The season has no official bounds but cyclones tend to form between April and December. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern Indian Ocean. There are two main seas in the North Indian Ocean‚Äîthe Bay of Bengal to the east of the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Sea to the west of India. The official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in this basin is the India Meteorological Department (IMD), while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) releases unofficial advisories. An average of five tropical cyclones form in the North Indian Ocean every season with peaks in May and November. Cyclones occurring between the meridians 45¬∞E and 100¬∞E are included in the season by the IMD. Systems There were 12 depressions that developed during the season. The first formed on June 20 in the northern Bay of Bengal. It soon moved ashore and dissipated on June 24. In August, there were two depressions and a cyclonic storm in the Bay of Bengal. The first formed in the Bay of Bengal on August 3, which dissipated after moving ashore eastern India the next day. The other formed on August 12, moved ashore two days later, and dissipated on August 16. A land depression existed over eastern India on September 9. Another Bay of Bengal depression formed on September 17 and moved ashore India a day later. From October 31 to November 2, a depression existed in the central Bay of Bengal. A depression existed off southwest Myanmar from November 8-10. August cyclonic storm On August 7, a cyclonic storm formed in the northern Bay of Bengal. It moved ashore Odisha the next day, and progressed northwestward through India. It was last observed on August 10 over western India. September cyclonic storm A depression formed in the Bay of Bengal on September 25, and quickly intensified into a cyclonic storm while moving northwestward. On September 26, the storm moved ashore Odisha. It eventually turned northward, dissipating over India on September 28. Tropical Storm One (1B) The monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression just east of Sri Lanka on October 25. The depression tracked northwestward, becoming a tropical storm on the 27th over southern India according to the JTWC. Over the Arabian Sea, it turned northeastward where, after reaching a peak of 120 km/h (75 mph) winds, it hit western India on November 2 as it recurved northeastward. The IMD last reported the system on November 3. Cyclone Two (2B) On November 20, Tropical Storm Two, having weakened from a cyclone that developed on the 17th, hit Bangladesh and dissipated soon after. Cyclone Three (3B) Cyclone Three, which formed from the monsoon trough in the Bay of Bengal on December 5, reached a peak of 85 mph winds on the 9th. It weakened as it continued northward, and hit near the Indian/Bangladesh border on the 10th as a 60 mph tropical storm. Widespread damage and flooding caused at least 92 fatalities.

The Cherokee in the American Civil War were active in the Trans-Mississippi and Western Theaters. In the east, Confederate Cherokees led by William Holland Thomas hindered Union forces trying to use the Appalachian mountain passes of western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee. Out west, Confederate Cherokee Stand Watie led primarily Native Confederate forces in the Indian Territory, in what is now the state of Oklahoma.\\"Watie, Stand (1806‚Äì1871)\\" Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of History and Culture; retrieved 31 Aug 2011 The Cherokee partnered with the Confederacy in order to get funds, as well as ultimately full recognition as a sovereign, independent state. Background Before Indian Removal, the Cherokee Nation was centered in and around the Blue Ridge Mountains‚Äîsouthwestern North Carolina, southeastern Tennessee, western South Carolina and northeastern Georgia. The Cherokee attempted to address their grievances by taking their problems to the American Federal judicial system. In 1830, a delegation led by Chief John Ross defended Cherokee rights before the U.S. Supreme Court in Cherokee Nation v. Georgia. The Indian cases set a precedent in Indian Country but was in vain as the Cherokee Nation was set upon the Trail of Tears. After the removals, the Cherokee Nation was found west of the Mississippi River, and some Cherokee were still found in the Blue Ridge Mountains. The Cherokee blamed the federal government and former United States President Andrew Jackson for the Trail of Tears. They also had adopted \\"Southern ways\\" before their removal from their Appalachia home. A few of them had owned slaves. Therefore, the western Cherokee already disliked the north when in 1860 William Seward, campaigning on behalf of Abraham Lincoln, said that Lincoln would open the Indian Territory for white settlement.Gibson p.117 Trans-Mississippi Theater 23px The Cherokee Braves Flag, as flown by Cherokee General Stand Watie. Chief of the Cherokee John Ross was adamant that the Union was not dissolved. However, another leader of the Cherokee, Stand Watie, joined the Confederate cause, and on June 1, 1861, began recruiting for all-Indian units that became part of the Confederate army. Full-blooded Cherokee tended to support Ross (who was primarily Scottish) while the mixed-blooded Cherokee supported the 3/4 Cherokee Stand Watie.Gibson p.119 Stand Watie in 1862 was elected Chief of the newly declared Southern Cherokee Nation. For the duration of the war, a series of small battles and constant guerrilla warfare were waged by Cherokee in the Indian Territory. Stand Watie officially became the last Confederate general to end fighting on June 25, 1865 at Fort Towson, in the southeast portion of the Indian Territory. The terms of the armistice allowed Watie and his command, the First Indian Brigade of the Army of the Trans-Mississippi, to demobilize rather than surrender and go home with their arms.Confer pp.150,153 Organization During the Civil War, the Cherokee Nation had approximately 21,000 members with 3,000 of them serving in the Confederacy as soldiers. *First Cherokee Mounted Rifles *1st Regiment of Cherokee Mounted Volunteers *2nd Regiment of Cherokee Mounted Volunteers *3rd Cherokee Regiment of Volunteer Cavalry *Cherokee Regiment (Special Services), CSA *1st Cherokee Battalion of Partisan Rangers *2nd Cherokee Artillery *Cherokee Special Services Battalion *Scales' Battalion of Cherokee Cavalry *Meyer's Battalion of Cherokee Cavalry *Cherokee Battalion of Infantry *1st Squadron of Cherokee Mounted Volunteers Battles and Skirmishes *Battle of Wilson's Creek (August 10, 1861) *Battle of Bird Creek (December 9, 1861) *Battle of Chustenahlah (December 26, 1861) *Battle of Pea Ridge (March 6‚Äì8, 1862) *Battle of Prairie Grove (December 7, 1862) *Battle of Honey Springs (July 17, 1863) *First Battle of Cabin Creek (July 1, 1863 ‚Äì July 2, 1863) *Ambush of the steamboat J.

Thomas' Legion, led by William H. Thomas, a European- American who was adopted Cherokee, were originally stationed outside Knoxville, Tennessee at Strawberry Plains, Tennessee. Their primary duty was to protect the Alum Cave, and harass Union troops that invaded Tennessee. While briefly working around Chattanooga, Tennessee in June 1862, Thomas personally captured a Union Soldier, after which each of his men vowed to capture at least one \\"Yankee\\" before the war was over.Rozema p.48 The Legion would become infamous due to their actions on September 15, 1862. While trying to stop a Union advance through Baptist Gap, a popular leader among the Cherokee, Astoogahtogeh, was killed leading a charge. Enraged, the remaining Cherokee were driven to avenge him. In retaliation for Astoogahtogeh's death, the Cherokee scalped the dead Union soldiers after the battle. After the event was reported in newspapers, Union soldiers would fear the Cherokee, but Thomas feared for the reputation of the Cherokee, as he did not want his people to be seen as barbaric. The scalps were sent to be buried with the soldiers they originally came from. After a number of Thomas' men were captured in February 1864, some were convinced by the Union that they were fighting for slavery, and thereafter fought for the Union. Others convinced their captors they also would defect to the Union side, but instead went back to Thomas and told him Union officials offered $5,000 for Thomas' scalp. After this, many of his men were sent to fight in Virginia, some of whom were present at Appomattox Court House for General Robert E. Lee's surrender.Rozema p.49 The rest of the Legion continued to fight until surrendering along with the commanding officer of the District of Western North Carolina to the Union commander they had captured on 10 May 1865. Organization In May 1861, William H. Thomas began recruiting Cherokees from the Quallatown, North Carolina area. The first two companies were composed mostly of Indian soldiers. They were called the Junaluska Zouaves. Thomas' Confederates were sometimes referred to as Thomas' Legion or Thomas' Legion of Cherokee Indians and Highlanders. They were later designated as the 69th North Carolina Regiment. *69th North Carolina Regiment **Field & Staff: Colonel William H. Thomas, Lieutenant Colonel James R. Love, Major William W.

Thomas and many of his followers were deeply in debt, to the point that the federal government recognized the eastern tribe as separate from the western tribe, and filed a lawsuit against the Cherokee's creditors, in effect leaving the protection of the Cherokee to the federal government. In the west, at the end of the war, with the Union victorious, the Union Cherokee established policies that confiscated land from the Confederate Cherokee. The Federal government promised the Confederate Cherokee that the laws promoting the confiscation would be annulled. This was due to Indian Commissioner D.N. Cooley, who saw opportunities in splitting the factions of the Cherokee, as represented by Ross and Watie. Cooley even went as far as to portray Ross as a traitor, when Ross had always been a Union advocate. The Cherokee were forced to adopt their slaves into the tribe, and to allow settlement of their lands by whites. In effect, due to the Cherokee split and the maneuverings of Cooley, the Cherokee suffered the worst of Reconstruction.Gibson pp.128,129 Monuments Monuments were dedicated for the Cherokee's wartime participation in the early 20th century.

History In January 1953, the Montgomery Board of Education purchased of property on Ann Street for $74,000 for a new high school. The new school would alleviate overcrowding at Sidney Lanier High School and accommodate children coming to Montgomery due to Maxwell and Gunter Air Force Bases. The final cost of the new facility was nearly $1.25 million. Lee High School opened to students for the first time on September 6, 1955. The new school had 35 faculty members and approximately 800 students. Most of the 232 juniors and 173 seniors entering Lee were transfers from Lanier, and some 354 sophomores moved up from area junior high schools. Lee's first graduating class consisted of 144 students. Expansion An auditorium was added in 1963. The guidance office, lunchroom, and library were enlarged and the math wing and mini-gym were added during the 1970s. By 1979 rooms were air conditioned, after students and teachers raised the necessary $80,000. In 1992, the library underwent extensive renovation and the entire school received a new roof. In 1997, land behind Lee formerly occupied by apartments was donated to the school, and in 2000 the space was completely paved to provide parking. In the summer of 2002, the entire school system was networked and wired with fiber optic cable to provide better and faster internet and network capabilities. Fine arts at the school have grown. The fine arts program includes drama which perform plays in the Auditorium, Art, Debate, and Choral . Lee High School started teaching 9th graders in the 2010/2011 school year.

Held is credited for one of the first patented designs for a racquet stringing machine. He named the company Ektelon based on a combination of two Greek words: \\"ektein\\", meaning to stretch out, and \\"telon\\", representing the concept of perfection. In 1970, Ektelon produced the first experimental racquetball racquet for Bud Muehleisen, a top racquetball player and early legend of the sport. The company moved into a larger facility in San Diego to begin manufacturing racquetball racquets on a larger scale. Over the years, Ektelon has introduced a number of new racquetball technologies, including the first racquetball racquet made of high-strength aluminum (1971), the first handlaid composite racquet (1978), the first oversized aluminum racquets (1984), and continues to develop new technologies in racquet design such as the elimination of string holes (O3). In 1988, Prince Sports purchased Ektelon. Ektelon involvement in racquetball tournaments Ektelon sponsors numerous tournaments and tours nationally and internationally, including: * US Racquetball Association * National Intercollegiate Championships * National Doubles Championships * National Singles Championships * Racquetball World Championships * World Outdoor Racquetball (WOR) Championships * World Outdoor Racquetball (WOR) * International Racquetball Tour * International Racquetball Federation * Classic Professional Racquetball Tour * Racquet for the Cure * Women's Professional Racquetball Organization Professional Ektelon Players (International Racquetball Tour - IRT)  Current World Top 100 IRT Professionals * Jose Rojas * Jansen Allen * Charlie Pratt * Adam Manilla * Andy Hawthorne * Farshid Guilak * Dylan Reid * Ryan Maher * Marco Bertarelli Team Ektelon Players * Nick Montalbano * Ricky Diaz * Richard Aal * Anthony Wong * Bill Gorge * Michael Baker * Yee Cheng * Steve Cook * Woody Clouse * Alex Ackerman * Ruben Gonzalez Ladies Professional Racquetball Tour (LPRT) Players * Rhonda Rajsich * Veronica Sotomayor * Michelle Key * Jessica Parrilla Outdoor Pros (WOR) Players * Craig Clubber Lane * Scott Davis * Bill Gorge * Andy Hawthorne * Gary Martin * Son Nguyen * Mike Orr * Jose Rojas * Rick Sandello * Robert Sostre * Jesus Ustarroz * Dillon Silver * Greg Solis * Veronica Sotomayor * Tracy Hawthorne * Kris Kaskawal * Michelle Key * Aubrey O'Brien Junior Elite Players * James D'Ambrogia * Justus Benson * Lily Berry * Sam Bredenbeck * Daniel Rojas * Dane Elkins * Sebastian Fernandez * Alexis Iwaasa * Ben Jenkel * Jonathan Lanford * Victoria Leon * Sawyer Lloyd * Heather Mahoney * Adam Manilla * Erika Manilla * Devon Pimentelli * Sam Reid * Chase Robison * Ricky Diaz * Kaitlyn Simmons * Samantha Simmons * Julian Singh References External links * Ektelon site * World Outdoor Racquetball (WOR) * Ektelon Racquetball Shop Sporting goods manufacturers of the United States Companies based in Burlington County, New Jersey Companies established in 1964 Racquetball ","title":"Ektelon"},{"id":"18787020","text":"HMWN Radio Maria (for Holy Mother World Networks) is a non-commercial Catholic broadcaster which operates as a closed circuit Subsidiary Communications Multiplex Operation (SCMO) and uses the subcarrier frequency of 67 kHz removed from the centre FM broadcast frequency of 102.1 MHz (CFNY-FM, a Corus Entertainment station licensed to Brampton) in Toronto, Ontario.

HMWN provides local Catholic programming for Toronto on weekdays into the evening hours along with the English language network feed of Radio Maria USA (originated by KJMJ 580 kHz in Alexandria, Louisiana) to provide the bulk of its overnight/early morning and weekend programming. Subchannel FM radios are available for listeners from its website. An audiostream is also provided on its website for listeners across Canada outside its Toronto signal area. Brief history HMWN began in Toronto as an English language service on May 8, 2005, 10 years after the formation of Radio Maria Canada, an Italian and French language FM subchannel. In 2008, HMWN was granted by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to broadcast its local program schedule and the Radio Maria USA network feed over digital cable lines. Since CRTC rules and regulations do not allow full-time religious broadcasting of a singular denomination over conventional AM and FM frequencies, HMWM is limited to broadcasting its Catholic programming schedule in this manner as CRTC rules only allow multi-faith broadcasting.

Art collector The name Kann, written with double \\"nn\\", was said in Paris to be \\"le plus chic du chic\\". Known for his discerning taste and shrewd collecting instincts, Kann shocked the art world in 1927 by auctioning off (at the American Art Association, New York City) most of his Old Master collection (including works by Bruegel, Cimabue, Fragonard, Pollaiuolo, Rubens and Tintoretto) in order to concentrate on the acquisition of 19th-century and modern art, which he collected vigorously over the following decade. Nazi theft Kann left France for England in 1938 without making an inventory of his eclectic art collection, which was kept in a St.-Germain-en-Laye mansion and subsequently looted in October 1940 by Nazi occupiers. Kann recovered only a small fraction of his large collection before his death in England in 1948.

During his playing career, he was a goalkeeper, representing Aldershot Town and Wycombe Wanderers, Queens Park Rangers, Hayes and latterly Margate, whom he also later managed until February 2017. Career Bull was born in Hastings, East Sussex and moved to Aldershot Town in the summer of 2002 after being released by Queens Park Rangers. In his first season at the club he was named player of the year and scored his solitary goal for the club, a penalty in the final home match as promotion to the Football Conference was secured. He again won the Player of the Year trophy in the 2005‚Äì06 season. In Aldershot's double-winning promotion season, Bull was named Goalkeeper of the Year and Non-League footballer of the Year by his peers. Despite his success, he said that he would leave Aldershot no matter what happened, and this was confirmed by the club at the end of the season. However, on 27 May 2008 it was announced that Bull would be staying on at Aldershot for a further two years. Bull played for Aldershot Town in their first game in the Football League against Accrington Stanley on 9 August 2008, which was won 1‚Äì0. He agreed to leave Aldershot at the end of July 2009 to pursue a career outside of football. However, he instead opted to continue his football career, and signed for Brentford on 3 August 2009. The following year, he turned down the offer of a further one-year contract with the Bees, and instead agreed a similar deal with Wycombe Wanderers on 7 June 2010. On 29 July 2010, Bull put in an outstanding performance against a Chelsea reserve side, making a very large number of saves and hampering Chelsea's efforts to score, which played a huge part in Wycombe's eventual 5‚Äì1 victory. On 25 April 2011, Bull saved a penalty in a match against Crewe Alexandra at Adams Park. His save prevented Crewe from equalising and Wycombe went on to win 2‚Äì0. Bull played every first team game in both league and cup and was rewarded by winning both the supporters' and players' player of the year awards. On 9 August 2011 Wycombe were involved in a penalty shootout against Colchester United in the first round of the League Cup. Wycombe won 5‚Äì4 on penalties after Bull saved a penalty in the shootout. On 8 November 2012 Bull left Wycombe by mutual consent. After being out of football for 18 months, Bull signed for Isthmian League side, Margate. Bull scored an injury time equaliser in the Kent derby at Tonbridge Angels on Boxing Day 2014. He also captained the side for the latter part of the season as Margate were promoted to the National League South via the play-offs after beating Hendon 1-0 and won the Players' Player of the Season award in 2014‚Äì15. Management career In December 2015, Bull was appointed manager of Margate until the end of the 2015‚Äì16 season. His appointment was subsequently extended until the end of the 2017‚Äì18 season. He resigned from his post in February 2017. On 11 May 2018, Bull was appointed as first-team manager of Isthmian League Premier Division side Leatherhead on a two-year contract.

Life and career Sella was born in Biella in the foothills of the Alps and acquired his interest in Alpinism from his uncle, Quintino Sella. He made a number of significant climbs in the Alps, including the first winter ascents of the Matterhorn and Monte Rosa, and the first winter traverse of Mont Blanc. He took part in several expeditions further afield, including three to the Caucasus (where a peak now bears his name), to Mount Saint Elias in Alaska, to the Rwenzori in Africa, and the 1909 expedition to K2 and the Karakoram. The latter three expeditions were in the company of Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi. Sella continued to climb into his old age, and made his last attempt on the Matterhorn at seventy six. The attempt failed when one of his guides was injured in an accident. Photography The high quality of Sella's photography was in part due to his use of 30√ó40 cm photographic plates, in spite of the difficulty of carrying bulky and fragile equipment into remote places. He had to invent equipment, including modified pack saddles and rucksacks, to allow these particularly large glass plates to be transported safely. His photographs were widely published and exhibited, and highly praised; Ansel Adams, who saw thirty-one that Sella had presented to the US Sierra Club, said they inspired \\"a definitely religious awe\\".Joanna Wright and Robin Lenman, \\"Mountain Photography\\". In The Oxford Companion to the Photograph (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005; ). Many of the photographs he took were of mountains which had not been previously recorded and so have historical as well as artistic significance; for example by recording the retreat of glaciers in the Rwenzori mountains in Central Africa. Death and legacy Sella died in Biella in 1943. His collection of photographs is now managed by the Sella Foundation (Fondazione Sella) in Biella. Some pictures of Sella are exhibited in the Museo Nazionale della Montagna \\"Duca degli Abruzzi\\" in Turin.

She was previously ordered to the dimensions specified in the 1741 proposals for modifications to the 1719 Establishment, but the Admiralty had very quickly concluded that these were too small, and as an experiment in 1742 authorised an addition of 6ft to the planned length, and Yarmouth was re-ordered to the enlarged design in June 1742. She was built at Deptford, where the Admiralty felt they could best observe the effectiveness of the added size, and launched on 8 March 1745. Commissioned in February 1745 under Captain Roger Martin. In 1747 under Captain Piercy Brett she was one of George Anson's squadron at the First Battle of Cape Finisterre. In 1781, Yarmouth was reduced in armament to become a 60-gun ship. She remained in this role until 1811, when she was broken up. Destroying USS Randolph On 7 March 1778 Yarmouth was attacked by the American frigate with half the guns and likely less than a quarter the firepower. The frigate managed to cause some minor damage to two of Yarmouths topmasts and a portion of her bowsprit, then attempted to rake (fire through the length of) the ship; Randolph was firing 3 broadsides to Yarmouths one, however the 12 lb shot would have struggled to penetrate Yarmouths hull, while Yarmouths 18 and 32-pounder guns would have been able to penetrate any part of her comparatively lightly armored opponent. Randolph exploded during the engagement, likely due to a shot penetrating her magazine, killing all but four of her crew. Part of her wreckage landed on Yarmouths decks, including Randolphs ensign. Yarmouth had to repair two damaged topmasts but suffered no significant damage and no fatalities or serious injuries.

Accessed 9 August 2006. Gloydius shedaoensis is a venomous pitviper species found only on Shedao Island in China. Although very small, this island is home to an extraordinarily large population of these snakes. No subspecies are currently recognized. Description Adults grow to an average snout-vent length (SVL) of 65‚Äì70 cm (25.6-27.6 inches). Scalation includes 23 rows of dorsal scales at midbody, an average of 157 ventral scales, and an average of 41 paired subcaudal scales. Also, the second supralabial scale is low and does not form the anterior margin of the heat- sensing loreal pit. The color pattern consists of a grayish brown ground color overlaid with a series of dark brown X-shaped markings. A postocular stripe is present that is very narrow and very dark in color.Gloyd HK, Conant R. 1990. Snakes of the Agkistrodon Complex: A Monographic Review. Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles. 614 pp. 52 plates. LCCN 89-50342. . Geographic range This snake is found only on Shedao Island off the coast of Liaotung in northeastern China. The type locality given is \\"Shedao (Snake Island), situated about [27.6 statute miles] from and to the north-west of L√ºshun (Port Arthur), Liaoning Province, altitude below 215 m [705 feet]\\" (China). Shedao Island lies 7 nautical miles (about 13 km or 8.1 statute miles) from the nearest mainland and has an area of 0.63 km¬≤ (156 acres), or 0.73 km¬≤ (180 acres). However, despite its small size, the population density of these snakes on the island has long been known to be extremely high. Koba (1938) estimated that, on the southeastern part of the island, there was about one snake for every square meter (10.8 sq ft), while Huang (1984) calculated that there were about 9,100-11,500 snakes on the island during the spring and fall of 1982 when the snakes were active. Feeding The diet consists of small passerine birds of various species. These birds migrate to and from their breeding grounds in Siberia and visit the island in May and September. The snakes prey on the birds during these months and are inactive for the rest of the year. Prey is ambushed either on the ground or from tree branches, the snake waiting with the anterior portion of its body in a concertina shape. Researchers have found specimens in this position, already containing two or three freshly ingested birds. Larger snakes on the ground also scavenge birds that have been struck and killed by other snakes too small to eat them. References Further reading * Zhao, Er-mi. 1979.

It is the administrative center of Chavdar Municipality. The municipality is located in the sub-Balkan Zlatitsa-Pirdop Basin. It consists of only one village, namely the village of Chavdar. The municipality is one of the smallest in Bulgaria, situated at the southern outskirts of the Balkan Mountains, and on the northern foothills of Sredna Gora mountain. It is located about 72 km (45 miles) east of Sofia, the capital city of Bulgaria. Close by are the cities of Zlatitsa and Pirdop.  History   Prehistoric time  Ever since prehistoric times the land of present time Chavdar has been populated by people. Archaeological excavations of a settlement mound near the Topolnitsa River show that a Neolithic community has been present as early as 7,000 years ago. The study of Neolithic culture \\"Chavdar\\" began in May 1968. Professor Georgi Georgiev and Senior Researcher Kancho Kanchev, both with the National Archaeological Museum of Bulgaria were leading the efforts through the years to uncover the hidden artifacts. Team of British archeologists were also involved in the archeological dig. Stratigraphic coring results confirmed the presence of seven cultural layers. By 1980 the site was fully explored. Neolithic Chavdar Culture, polychromatic and anthropomorphic pottery, 6200-5400 B.C., Bulgaria Early Neolithic village of Chavdar is isochronous to Karanovo I and II Neolithic sites which are dated about 6200 BC. The artifact findings are also similar to Kremikovtsi Neolithic village findings. \\"Early Neolithic culture Kremikovtsi‚ÄîChavdar\\" is the earliest Neolithic culture in the Sofia Plain and the sub-Balkan Basin. This culture artifacts have played important role in periodization of the prehistoric time in Bulgaria and the region. The Neolithic settlement mound consisted of pile dwellings along the Topolnitsa River. Extremely valuable Neolithic painted pottery and stone tools have been found. A sword dated back to 4th century B.C. is also among the artifacts. Other findings include pottery and coins dated to different time in history. All artifacts were made available to specialists for further studies. Now all the findings are in the exhibitions of the Bulgarian National Archaeological Museum (Capital Sofia), and the local historical museum (City of Pirdop).  Medieval Time  According to Dobreyshovo Gospels (first quarter of the 13th century), a village named Markovo has been situated east of the present day village site in a location called \\"Kyoidere\\". The first written evidence of the present day village of Chavdar are found in the Ottoman Nikopol District Tax Register dating back to 1430. The village of Chavdar can be found under the name Kolanlar[e] listing 29 taxpayers.  Present Time  Chavdar Village Hall The village of Chavdar was known as Kolanlare until 1899 when the village inhabitants named their village Radoslavovo after the name of the Bulgarian Liberal Party (Radoslavists) leader at the time Dr. Vasil Radoslavov, a long- time politician, member of parliament, minister in various capacities, and prime minister of Bulgaria. Legend has it, while visiting the village, sitting at the banks of Topolnitsa River, Dr. Radoslavov has said: \\"If there is a paradise upon Earth, it is here in Bulgaria. \\"If there is a paradise in Bulgaria, it is here [in Chavdar]\\". Chavdar acquired its present name on 5 February 1946. It was named after Chavdar Resistance Brigade, a Bulgarian partisan group of World War II that was active in the region.

Jane The Daily Mirror cartoonist Norman Pett had been drawing a weekly cartoon since 1932 which he called Jane's Journal ‚Äî The Diary of A Bright Young Thing. Pett's original model was his wife, but he replaced her with Chrystabel in 1940. In 1944, when Jane first appeared nude in the cartoon, she was credited with 'inspiring' the 36th Division to advance six miles into Burma. In 1948, Pett's assistant Michael Hubbard took over the Jane cartoons. Chrystabel Leighton-Porter began a music hall striptease-act based on the Jane character which toured army bases around the country. She won the title of \\"Britain's Perfect Girl\\" at the London Palladium and was signed up by theatrical agent Lew Grade which led to her starring in the film The Adventures of Jane in 1949. It was released on DVD in April 2008. \\"Jane\\" received many letters from servicemen proposing marriage (62 in just one week ) and Chrystabel was careful to hide the fact that she had already secretly married Arthur Leighton-Porter, a Royal Air Force pilot, before the outbreak of the war. Hubbard continued to develop the cartoons' storyline until 1959, when he gave Jane a happy marriage and ended the series. Later life In 1952 Leighton-Porter gave birth to a stillborn baby boy, and then in 1955 suffered another loss of a baby girl named Jane who lived for just fourteen hours. In 1957 the couple had a son Simon, who grew up to be a writer., Simon Leighton-Porter. In the fifties, she worked for theatre impresario Paul Raymond in such shows as the Festival of Strip-tease (1958). In the early-1960s Leighton-Porter moved to Bermuda and then to Horsham, Sussex where she centred her activities around her son Simon (who later followed his father into the RAF) and was a fundraiser for several charities. She was also active in her local Conservative Party association. In the 1980s a BBC television adaptation was made of \\"Jane\\", starring Glynis Barber. In her later years, Leighton-Porter made regular appearances at wartime reunions. In 1993, the Imperial War Museum exhibition Forces Sweethearts included her 1940s frilly knickers. She died on 6 December 2000 aged 87. Arthur died in January 2002. References *Saunders, Andy (2004) Jane, a Pin Up at War. Barnsley: Leo Cooper . * \\" Jane\\" film. 1943.

Biography Crosdill was born in London, England and was the son of violoncellist Richard Crosdill (1698‚Äì1790) with whom he is sometimes confused. John Crosdill, along with James Cervetto (1747‚Äì1837), son of Italian √©migr√© Giacobbe Cervetto (1682‚Äì1783), was one of the most visible cellists in London during the 1770s and 1780s. Crosdill was a skilled performer but not a strong composer. He played concertos, concertinas, continuo sonatas and chamber music; both solos and orchestral parts. Crosdill's musical training began when, at a young age, he became a chorister at Westminster Abbey under the direction of John Robinson and Benjamin Cooke. He later took up violoncello under his father's tutelage. Musical career Crosdill made his first public appearance as a violoncellist at age nine when Emanuel Siprutini (1730‚Äì1790), his probable teacher, presented him in a duo. He was accepted into the Royal Society of Musicians in 1768, at the age of seventeen. In the spring of 1775, Crosdill played at the King's Theatre in the oratorios sponsored by Johann Christian Bach (1735‚Äì1782). He subsequently played for the oratorios at Covent Garden in 1777 and at Drury Lane in 1779, 1782 and 1784. Crosdill was the principal cellist for the Three Choirs Festival, each year from 1769, (except 1778) and was principal violoncellist for the Concerts of Ancient Music from its establishment in 1776 until his retirement. On 10 March 1778 Crosdill became violist in the Chapel Royal. In 1782, Crosdill was appointed chamber musician to Queen Charlotte and violoncello instructor to the Prince of Wales (later George IV). It was this appointment that made Crosdill the most fashionable violoncello teacher of his day. His resulting acclaim led to the performance of many private concerts for nobility including the Friday afternoon ladies' concerts which he organised. Crosdill's 1784 appointment to Composer and Master of the King's Band in Ireland by the Duke of Rutland, was controversial. Many elite professional musicians, including Dr Charles Burney (1726‚Äì1814), thought Crosdill unworthy of this sinecure. Crosdill played in the annual productions of Messiah and was principal violoncellist for the 1784 Handel commemorative concerts given at Westminster Abbey. During his prime, Crosdill made many sojourns to Paris where he was a favourite of Marie Antoinette. There he studied with and became close friends with the Duport brothers, Jean-Pierre Duport (1741‚Äì1818), and Jean-Louis Duport (1749‚Äì1819). He was member of Giovanni Batista Viotti's (1755‚Äì1825) orchestra for the Concert de la Loge Olympique in 1780. Crosdill returned to England permanently in 1785. That year he spent the Spring concert season performing in the Pantheon Series and organised competition with Hanover Square Series for which James Cervetto (1747‚Äì1837) played. The Pantheon series included numerous performances by the Maras; vocalist Gertrud Elisabeth Mara and her husband violoncellist Johann Baptist Mara (1744‚Äì1808). It was through his association with the Maras that Crosdill met Haydn in 1791 and purchased the \\"Mara\\" Stradivari in 1802. Crosdill taught many of the next generation of violoncellists, including Robert Lindley (1776‚Äì1855). Marriage Social eyebrows were raised when Crosdill married Elizabeth, n√©e Thresher, the wealthy widow of Robert Colebrook, (brother of Sir George Colebrooke), on 31 May 1785 at St. Marylebone Church, London. Elizabeth was many years Crosdill's senior and her comfortable income from interests in Wiltshire, allowed him to retire from public performance. He did, however, perform two years at the Three Choirs Festival in Gloucester and the coronation of George IV on 19 July 1821. His wife, who died in 1807, bequeathed all her estates to her surviving sisters, with Crosdill's name only mentioned in the probate note. Sources give conflicting information about his death in early October 1825. Most say he died in Escrick, Yorkshire, at the home of a nephew of his friend Beilby Thompson. Others maintain that he died at his house in London. By his will signed at 45 Berners Street on 30 August 1825 and proved at London on 25 October 1825, his son from a subsequent marriage, Lieutenant Colonel John Crosdill of the East India Company, inherited a substantial fortune. Crosdill left bequests of 19 guineas each for remembrance rings to numerous friends including the musicians Benjamin Blake and William Shield, his Berners Street neighbour. Lieut-Col Crosdill presented the Royal Society of Musicians with ¬£1000 in accordance with his father's will.

As of 2016, she is the Edward C. Jeffrey Professor of Biology in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University and is affiliated with the Rowland Institute. Cavanaugh was the first to propose that the deep-sea giant tube worm, Riftia pachyptila, obtains its food from bacteria living within its cells, an insight which she had as a graduate student at Harvard. Significantly, she made the connection that these chemoautotrophic bacteria were able to play this role through their use of chemosynthesis, the biological oxidation of inorganic compounds (e.g., hydrogen sulfide) to synthesize organic matter from very simple carbon-containing molecules, thus allowing organisms such as the bacteria (and dependent organisms such as tube worms) to exist in deep ocean without sunlight. Early life and education Cavanaugh was born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1953. Cavanaugh received her undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan in 1977, where she initially studied music but ultimately majored in ecology. She says her life changed direction in her sophomore year when she heard about a course in marine ecology at the oceanographic center in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. There, her work involved wading out into chilly waters to study the mating habits of horseshoe crabs, and she described herself as \\"[falling] in love\\" with the relaxed camaraderie and exchange of ideas between biologists, geologists, and scientists from other disciplines. Cavanaugh ended up stranded in the Greater Boston area looking for a job, and ultimately replaced a \\"no show\\" in a Boston University undergraduate research program, which returned her to work with local horseshoe crabs. Cavanaugh then moved to Cape Cod to work at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole. During the next two years the focus of her attention shifted from Crustacea to bacteria, \\"creatures that impressed her for their ability to live anywhere.\\" Graduate training Cavanaugh's analyses of bacterial symbioses involving giant tube worms and other deep sea invertebrateshas led to her being described as a \\"scientific Captain Nemo.\\" Cavanaugh pursued her graduate training in biology at Harvard University, in association with the Museum of Comparative Zoology. She entered Harvard in the fall of 1979, earning an M.A. in 1981 and graduating with her PhD in biology in 1985. Her Ph.D. dissertation, entitled Symbiosis of chemoautotrophic bacteria and marine invertebrates, was accepted in 1985. Discovery of chemosynthesis in tube worms By one account, Cavanaugh was attending a lecture by Meredith L. Jones, curator of worms at the Smithsonian Institution, shortly after she began her graduate studies. Jones was discussing the giant tube worm, a creature lacking both mouth and gut, where the challenge was to understand how it survived. Jones mentioned elemental sulfur crystals within the worms gut; Cavanaugh states that \\"It was at that point that I jumped up and said, 'Well, it's perfectly clear! They must have sulphur-oxidising bacteria inside their bodies'\\". Jones apparently told her to sit down, but provided Cavanaugh with a specimen captured by a research submarine working on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. Cavanaugh eventually substantiated her case. The Harvard Gazette describes Cavanaugh's pioneering study of these unique creatures: > As a first-year graduate student, she discovered what makes life possible‚Ä¶ > where the sun never shines, [where] temperatures can exceed 250 degrees F, > and [where] the ocean exerts pressures of thousands of pounds on every > square inch of an animal's body.

Cavanaugh went on to publish the results of the further work that began to substantiate the discovery, writing from the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard, as first of a five author paper, a short 1981 Science report with Stephen L. Gardiner and Meredith L. Jones of the Smithsonian Institution, and Holgar W. Jannasch and John B. Waterbury at Woods Hole (see Significant publications). Career Cavanaugh's first appointment was as a Junior Fellowship in the Society of Fellows at Harvard University, in 1986‚Äì1989. This was followed by elevation to assistant professorship in 1989, and associate professor in 1993. In 1995, she was granted tenure as a full professor \\"for [her] discoveries and her reputation as a teacher and mentor.\\" Research and outreach highlights Cavanaugh has continued to build her career on the study of hydrothermal vent ecology. Cavanaugh went on to discover similar symbiotic partnerships among Solemyidae clams living in shallow eelgrass beds and mudflats along the New England coast, and in shrimp near sub-sea springs in the middle of the Atlantic. Cavanaugh believes that life on Earth may have started under similar conditions and says \\"the idea makes sense because some of the oldest forms of free-living bacteria show signs of being heat-loving organisms.\\" Cavanaugh's work has made the scientific community rethink the \\"warm chicken soup\\" theory of life's origins in which the accumulation of organic molecules in shallow waters was a result of lightning electricity. Ruth Turner and Cavanaugh dissecting Alvin-retrieved clams from the deep sea in 1992 Cavanaugh's discoveries of the biology of the deep Pacific Ocean were made in a Cambridge, Massachusetts (Harvard) laboratory, and she worked on marine life in the laboratory and onboard ships for twelve years before securing a place on the deep-diving submarine Alvin; she went to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, off the Florida coast, for the first time in 1992. According to the Harvard Gazette article: > Not many people have visited with 6-foot-long, bright red worms on the > boiling bottom of the ocean. It sounds like a Jules Verne fantasy, but newly > tenured Professor of Biology Colleen Cavanaugh has seen these and other > strange creatures on voyages to the bottom of the deep sea. She later participated in more \\"Extreme Expeditions\\"‚Äîsuch as a dive to a depth of 8,200 feet off the west coast of Mexico to collect tube worms and their bacteria, the chemically-rich fluids that flow out of the vents, and mineral samples from the deep sea ocean floor. Cavanaugh, who has been called \\"a scientific Captain Nemo.\\" is prominent in her field of biology.Robert Kunzig, in describing her work for a 2001 Discover magazine article, writes of her visit to \\"a hot crack in the Earth under the Indian Ocean\\": > Biologists who study the physiology of organisms are under time pressure: > They must dissect the organisms before they deteriorate. Colleen Cavanaugh, > a microbiologist from Harvard, needs animals that are alive and not starved; > once they've been away from their vent too long, even if they've been > sitting in a box on the ocean floor, they start to digest the symbiotic > bacteria in which she is interested. As reported in February 2000, Cavanaugh is the discoverer of a new species of deep-dwelling mussel in the Gulf of Mexico that shares its body with symbiotic bacteria that feed on methane. She joined Craig Smith of the University of Hawaii and other colleagues in a Nature report on a NOAA National Undersea Research Program study at its West Coast and Polar Regions Center (at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks), regarding how whale corpses that drop to the bottom of the ocean‚Äîand their bones in particular‚Äîplay an important role in ocean floor ecology. Cavanaugh Laboratory The Cavanaugh Laboratory at Harvard works on a number of projects related to bacterial symbiosis in marine invertebrates from deep sea hydrothermal vents, methane seeps, and coastal reducing sediments. Researchers there have a special interest in characterizing the metabolic and genetic capabilities of symbionts, their evolutionary relationships with free-living bacteria, and the co-evolution of symbiont and host.

As part of the global surveillance network ECHELON, Bad Aibling used to be one of the larger listening posts outside the USA and equalled its counterparts RAF Menwith Hill (UK), the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap (AUS) and CFS Leitrim (CDN).  History  In 1936 a military airfield was established by the German National Socialist government at the site of a sport airfield in Bad Aibling-Mietraching.History of the \\"Fliegerhorst\\" Mietraching at www.mietraching.de (in German) After the Second World War, troops of the United States Army seized the military airport (\\"Fliegerhorst\\" and flight training base) that had evolved from the airfield. Initially, it was used by the occupying Americans as a camp for prisoners of war. G√ºnter Grass and Joseph Ratzinger, later Pope Benedict XVI, are alleged to have met there as prisoners.open book: Ratzinger and Grass After the last prisoners had been discharged in 1946, the grounds of the airbase were transformed into a displaced persons camp for former members of the Royal Yugoslav Army who had been deported to Germany during the war. The Bad Aibling DP camp was first run by UNRRA and later by the IRO. In 1948, the Yugoslav DPs were transferred to another DP camp in Munich, making room for a new relief project: the IRO Children's Village Bad Aibling, which housed over 2,300 unaccompanied children and youth who had been displaced during or as a result of the war, and who represented more than 20 nationalities. An international team of relief workers, including a group of Quakers from the AFSC, took care of the children until the Village was closed in late 1951. In 1952, the area was taken over by the US Army. Since a four-power agreement enacted Austria's neutrality in 1955, US listening devices that were situated there had to be abandoned. They were relocated to Bad Aibling and during the Cold War field station 81 was converted by the United States Army Security Agency (\\"ASA\\") to a central communications monitoring station for American intelligence.OVB online: B&O-Gel;√§nde - einst und heute . Retrieved on September 16th, 2015 In 1971 the National Security Agency (NSA) and the United States Department of Defense took over command from the U.S. Army. Simultaneously, the Army Security Agency transferred most of its activities in West Germany from its field stations located at Rothwesten, Bad Aibling and Herzogenaurach to Augsburg. In 1994, the NSA transferred command of its Bad Aibling base to INSCOM, one of the Central Security Services of United States.RAVEN: INSCOM in Bad Aibling (in German) After the end of the Cold War, on several occasions including investigations of the European Parliament that censured industrial espionage by American secret services, the Americans intended to close the Bad Aibling Station. The September 11, 2001 attacks delayed these plans. Restructuring of the US intelligence community after the September 11, 2001 caused the closure of Bad Aibling Station in Septembertr 2004. The base was transferred back to the Federal Republic of Germany. Information uncovered by Der Spiegel in 2013 from the Edward Snowden leaks indicated that the NSA continued its presence at Bad Aibling until 2006, supported by the BND, by using equipment in a metal- clad building known as \\"Tin Can\\".

It is a group of terrestrial hypercarnivorous crocodilians from South America (Argentina and Brazil) and possibly Pakistan. Baurusuchidae has been defined as a clade containing the most recent common ancestor of Baurusuchus and Stratiotosuchus and all of its descendants. It may, however, be polyphyletic, as recent phylogenetic analyses have placed Baurusuchus within Notosuchia and other baurusuchids within the more distantly related clade Sebecia. A recent study of the family finds it monophyletic by including the South American genera Baurusuchus, Cynodontosuchus, Pissarrachampsa, Stratiotosuchus, and Wargosuchus. Other traditional baurusuchids like Pabwehshi are excluded. The recently named Campinasuchus is also included in the family. Baurusuchids have been placed in the suborder Baurusuchia, and two subfamilies have been proposed: Baurusuchinae and Pissarrachampsinae. Genera Several genera have been assigned to Baurusuchidae. Baurusuchus was the first, being the namesake of the family. Remains of Baurusuchus have been found from the Late Cretaceous Bauru Group of Brazil in deposits that are Turonian - Santonian in age. In addition to Baurusuchus, five other South American crocodyliforms have been assigned to Baurusuchidae: Campinasuchus, Cynodontosuchus, Pissarrachampsa, Stratiotosuchus, and Wargosuchus. Cynodontosuchus was the first known baurusuchid, named in 1896 by English paleontologist Arthur Smith Woodward, although it was only recently assigned to Baurusuchidae. Wargosuchus was described in 2008. Cynodontosuchus and Wargosuchus are known only from fragmentary remains. Both genera are from the Santonian of Argentina. Skull of Pissarrachampsa. A fourth genus, Stratiotosuchus, was assigned to Baurusuchidae in 2001. Fossils have been found from the Turonian - Santonian of Brazil. Pabwehshi is the youngest genus that has been assigned to Baurusuchidae, and is from the Maastrichtian of Pakistan. It was named in 2001 but has since been reassigned as a basal member of Sebecia. A new genus, Campinasuchus, was assigned to the family in May, 2011. It is known from the Turonian-Santonian Adamantina Formation of the Bauru Basin of Brazil. Soon after, the new genus Pissarrachampsa was named from the Campanian‚ÄìMaastrichtian Vale do Rio do Peixe Formation, also in the Bauru Basin. Phylogeny The family Baurusuchidae was named by Brazilian paleontologist Llewellyn Ivor Price in 1945 to include Baurusuchus. In 1946, American paleontologist Edwin Harris Colbert erected the group Sebecosuchia, which united Baurusuchidae with the family Sebecidae (represented by the genus Sebecus). Both Baurusuchus and Sebecus have deep snouts and ziphodont dentitions (teeth that are serrated and laterally compressed). Other forms were later found that had a close appearance to these two genera, among them Cynodontosuchus, Stratiotosuchus, and Wargosuchus. Several features were used to unite these groups: a deep snout, a ziphodont dentition, a curved tooth row, an enlarged canine-like dentary tooth that fits into a deep notch in the upper jaw, and a groove on the lower jaw. Many phylogenetic analyses within the past decades have supported a close relationship between the two families. Baurusuchids and sebecosuchids are both early members of the clade Metasuchia, which includes the subgroups Notosuchia (mainly terrestrial crocodyliforms) and Neosuchia (larger, often semiaquatic crocodyliforms, including living crocodylians). Sebecosuchians, which include both baurusuchids and sebecosuchids, were found to be closely related to notosuchians in several studies. The new genera Iberosuchus and Eremosuchus were later assigned to Baurusuchidae, and phylogenetic analyses encompassing these taxa continued to find Baurusuchidae to be closely related to Sebecidae. Both families were allied with notosuchians in the larger group Ziphosuchia, composed of ziphodont crocodyliforms. More recently, sebecosuchians - including baurusuchids - have been placed within Notosuchia as derived members of the clade. Below is a modified cladogram from Ortega et al. (2000) placing baurusuchids within Notosuchia: In 2004, the superfamily Baurusuchoidea was established to include baurusuchids and sebecids. Phylogenetically, Baurusuchoidea was defined as the most recent common ancestor of Baurusuchus and Sebecus and all of its descendants while Baurusuchidae was defined as the most recent common ancestor of Baurusuchus and Stratiotosuchus and all of its descendants. In a 2005 analysis, Sebecidae was found to be a paraphyletic grouping, or a grouping that includes some descendants of a common ancestor but not all. Sebecids formed an assemblage of basal sebecosuchians, while baurusuchids remained a valid grouping of derived sebecosuchians. Below is a modified cladogram from Turner and Calvo (2005): Later studies noted many features that distinguished baurusuchids from sebecosuchids. Sebecosuchids were often considered to be more closely related to Neosuchia, a group that includes modern crocodylians, while baurusuchids were thought to be a more distantly related clade. In a 1999 phylogenetic analysis, Baurusuchus formed a clade with notosuchians to the exclusion of other ziphosuchians. This placement has been upheld by recent analyses, which place Baurusuchus within Notosuchia. In 2007, a new clade called Sebecia was erected. Sebecia included sebecids and peirosaurids. Peirosauridae, a family of small terrestrial crocodyliforms, had often been placed in or near Neosuchia in previous studies. The assignment of sebecids to Sebecia placed the family closer to Neosuchia than Notosuchia. In this study, baurusuchids were split up, with Baurusuchus placed as a more basal metasuchian and the remaining baurusuchids (Bretesuchus and Pabwehshi) placed as sebecians. Therefore, the family Baurusuchidae was paraphyletic. Below is a modified cladogram from Larsson and Sues (2007): More recent studies have nested Baurusuchus deep within Notosuchia, just as the larger group Sebecosuchia once was, while the remaining sebecosuchian genera have been placed more distantly in Metasuchia. A new baurusuchid called Pissarrachampsa was named in 2011, and a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of baurusuchids was conducted along with its description. Montefeltro et al. (2011) found Baurusuchidae to be a monophyletic group with the genera Baurusuchus, Cynodontosuchus, Pissarrachampsa, Stratiotosuchus, and Wargosuchus. They adopted the name Baurusuchia in a phylogenetic sense to distinguish baurusuchids from related crocodyliforms. Baurusuchia was first erected as an infraorder in 1968, but in the 2011 analysis it was found to be in an identical position to Baurusuchidae in the final tree. The only difference between Baurusuchidae and Baurusuchia is that the former is a node-based taxon and the latter is a stem-based taxon. Baurusuchidae is defined as the least inclusive clade containing Baurusuchus, Cynodontosuchus, Pissarrachampsa, Stratiotosuchus, and Wargosuchus. As in all node-based clades, there is a most recent common ancestor; these genera are all of its known descendants. Baurusuchia is defined as Baurusuchus pricei and all Crocodyliformes that share a more recent common ancestor with B. pricei than with Notosuchus terrestris, Mariliasuchus amarali, Armadillosuchus arrudai, Araripesuchus gomesi, Sebecus icaeorhinus, Bretesuchus bonapartei, Peirosaurus torminni, or Crocodylus niloticus. In contrast to the node-based Baurusuchidae, the stem-based Baurusuchia does not include a common ancestor and all its descendants, but rather all forms more closely related to a specific baurusuchid than a non-baurusuchid. As a stem-based taxon, Baurusuchia is more inclusive than Baurusuchidae; a new taxon could potentially be placed outside Baurusuchidae because it is not a descendant of the most recent common ancestor of baurusuchids, but would still be a baurusuchian because it is more closely related to baurusuchids than it is to other crocodyliforms. For now, however, Baurusuchidae and Baurusuchia are essentially identical in scope. Montefeltro et al. (2011) also divided Baurusuchidae into two subfamilies, Pissarrachampsinae and Baurusuchinae. Pissarrachampsinae includes Pissarrachampsa and Wargosuchus while Baurusuchinae includes Stratiotosuchus and Baurusuchus. Cynodontosuchus is not a member of either of these subfamilies, but the most basal baurusuchid. Many of the unique features that separate Cynodontosuchus may also be associated with a juvenile individual. The material that Cynodontosuchus is based on has been suggested to be a juvenile form of Baurusuchus, and the two taxa may be synonymous. Below is a cladogram from Montefeltro et al. (2011): A sixth genus of baurusuchid, Campinasuchus, was named just a few months before Pissarrachampsa, and was not included in the analysis. Paleobiology In 2011, fossilized eggs were described from the Late Cretaceous Adamantina Formation of Brazil that may have been laid by a baurusuchid, most probably Baurusuchus. A new oospecies called Bauruoolithus fragilis was named on the basis of these remains. The eggs are about twice as long as they are wide and have blunt ends. At about a quarter of a millimeter in thickness, the shells are relatively thin. Some eggs may have already hatched by the time they were buried, but none show extensive degradation. In living crocodilians (the closest living relatives of baurusuchids), eggs undergo extrinsic degradation to allow hatchlings to easily break through their shells. The fossils indicate that baurusuchid hatchlings probably broke through thin egg shells rather than shells that had been degraded over their incubation period.

Wine region  Located next to the new town of Nemea, approximately from Corinth, the appellation of Nemea is the most important red wine AOC of southern Greece and arguably of all of Greece. Also Nemea is the biggest vineyard of all Balkan territory. In the Nemea region, the indigenous Greek Agiorgitiko grape variety is grown. It produces wines famous for their deep red color, complex aroma and long, velvety palate.All about Greek Wine: Winemaking Regions.

Variations There are varying degrees of automatism. Some may include simple gestures, such as finger rubbing, lip smacking, chewing, or swallowing, or more complex actions, such as sleepwalking behaviors. Others may include speech, which may or may not be coherent or sensible. The subject may or may not remain conscious otherwise throughout the episode. Those who remain conscious may be fully aware of their other actions at the time, but unaware of their automatism. In some more complex automatisms, the subject enters into the behaviors of sleepwalking while fully awake up until the moment it starts.

The Avignon Exchange was one of the first foreign exchange markets in history, established in the Comtat Venaissin during the Avignon Papacy. The Exchange was composed of the agents (factores) of the great Italian banking- houses, who acted as money-changers as well as financial intermediaries between the Apostolic Camera and its debtors and creditors. The most prosperous quarter of the city of Avignon, where the bankers settled, became known simply as the Exchange. According to de Roover, \\"Avignon can be considered an Italian colony, since the papal bankers were all Italians\\".de Roover, Raymond. 2007. Money, Banking and Credit in Mediaeval Bruges. . p. 3. Avignon was the first legal body to regulate fiduciary transactions:Alsonso Mart√≠n and Agost√≠n Aurelio y Blasco Cirera, La banca a trav√©s de los tiempos (Barcelona) 1926:133. a statute of Avignon, of 1243, contains a paragraph entitled De Litteris Cambii, \\"of bills of exchange\\".Ren√© de Mauldes, \\"Co√ªtumes et reglements de la R√©publique d'Avignon au XIIIe si√®cle\\", Revue historique de droit fran√ßais et etranger 1878:378, noted in Piedro Alfonso Labariega Villanueva, \\"La metamorfosis de la acceptaci√≥n cambiaria desde el r√©gimen statutario hasta el reglamentario internacional uniforme\\", II.1 \\"Los estatutos de Avi√±√≥n de 1243\\", in Revesto del Derecho Privado 6 (September 2007/August 2008:17-36), p 15 (on-line text). Background Unlike most medieval rulers who levied funds from sources of taxation relatively nearby, the papacy's primary source of income was constituted from taxes and tributes collected across Europe. Moreover, the papacy had a gross geographic mismatch of its assets and liabilities: money collected in France and Poland, for example, might be spent for military reconquest in the Papal States. The papacy soon discovered that the direct transfer or shipment of physical specie over long distances was not only risky but extremely expensive, and was thus forced to procure the services of international merchant-bankers who dealt in foreign exchange from their branches throughout the important commercial centers of Western Europe not only in large centers but at the sites of the Champagne fairs. However, the Italian merchant-bankers could be of no assistance for funds collected in Eastern Europe (mainly Poland, Hungary, and Bohemia), Scandinavia, and Northern Germany where there was no organized money market at this time, and thus the direct transfer of funds was still required. The preferred alternative to shipping specie was to entrust small amounts to ecclesiastics who happened to be traveling to visit the pope or (more often) traveling merchants on their way to Bruges or Venice (however, to transfer funds from Krakow to Bruges to Avignon took over a year). Even in Western Europe, direct transfer of funds was required when the foreign exchange market could not provide the necessary liquidity; for example, in 1327, 100,000 florins were sent from Avignon to Bologna in a caravan of fifteen pack animals guarded by an armed escort of forty-six. The Apostolic Camera, or papal treasury, was established in the 13th century, with close ties to Italian merchant bankers, who were given the title mercatores camerae apostolicae (\\"mercatores\\" of the Apostolic Camera). The papal residences of Rome, Viterbo, and Rieti were close to the two main banking centers in Italy: Florence and Siena; however, these connections were severed during the reign of Pope Clement V (1305‚Äì1315) as he wandered through Languedoc and Provence. Only when Pope John XXII (1316‚Äì1334) began the construction of a permanent papal residence in Avignon, the Palais des Papes, did the major Italian banks open branches in the Curia and resume their dealings with the Camera. However, the closeness of this relationship never equaled the \\"intimate\\" management of the Gran Tavola of Orlando Bonsignori in the 13th century; instead of entrusting idle funds to merchant bankers for investment, the papal Chamberlain, Treasurer, and Vice-treasurer (all high-ranking ecclesiastics, assisted by a \\"throng\\" of clerics, notaries, and laymen) managed these funds more physically, keeping them in a \\"strong room\\" built specifically for this purpose. Theology of usury than Biblical accounts of Jesus. Although scholastic economic philosophers had constructed a wide variety of prohibitions and loopholes related to the conduct of traditional lending (usury), there is very little scholastic thought on foreign exchange transactions except insofar as they related to the covering of loan repayment.de Roover, Raymond. 1967. \\"The Scholastics, Usury, and Foreign Exchange\\". The Business History Review, 41(3): pp. 257-271. Raymond de Roover notes that: :\\"One paradoxical result of this controversy was that pawnbrokers and small money-lenders were the main victims of the campaigns waged against usury by friars like Bernardino of Feltre, but the big bankers and international connections were left undisturbed. Far from being censured they were called \\"the peculiarly beloved sons of the Church\\" and prided themselves in being the Pope's exchangers. In fact, their services were indispensable for the transfer of papal funds.\\" Thus, \\"Profit and Loss on Exchange\\" (Pro e danno di cambio) was not considered usury and was frequently listed in accounting books. History From 1316 to 1342, the Avignon popes relied on the exchange services of three large Florentine banking houses‚Äîthe Bardi, Peruzzi, and Acciaioli‚Äîall of whom failed in 1342, bringing down the entire papal transfer system with them.de Roover, Raymond. 1946. Review of Les relations des papes d'Avignon et des compagnies commerciales et bancaires de 1316-1478 by Yves Renouard. Speculum. 21(3): pp. 355-259. From 1342 to 1362, the Apostolic Camera was required to use the services of several smaller and weaker firms from Asti (especially Malabayla), Lucca, and Pistoia; the Camera was unsuccessful in trying to build up the capacity of each of these bankers. However, in 1362, the papacy was able to employ the services of the Alberti antichi banking house in Florence, which had recently risen to prominence. The papacy did not use the mechanism of the bill of exchange (which had been common since the 13th century), but rather employed a unique procedure, which required a receipt in notarial form for all transfers to Avignon, called the instrumentum cambii; this instrument‚Äîalways made out in duplicate or triplicate‚Äîspecified the amount received by the banker and proxy and recorded a promise to transmit to Avignon and pay to the pope or his agent a certain amount. One copy of the instrument was sent to Avignon by the papal carrier which enabled the Avignon administration to obtain payment from either the banker or their Avignon representative. The use of written documents was considered \\"not businesslike\\" by contemporaries as it required the constant \\"intervention of notaries\\". The instrumentum cambii (also known as an \\"Avisa\\") did not eliminate the possibility of fraud, but rather created different possibilities for misdealings, as seen with a 1359 exchange between Venice and Avignon.Usher, Abbot Payson. 1914. \\"The Origin of the Bill of Exchange\\".

They were the largest of the engines on the Hull and Barnsley Railway. The Class A was developed to deal with the steeply graded eastern section of the H&BR; between Springhead and Sandholme. Because of this the special link workings they dealt with were nicknamed the \\"Sandholme Bankers\\". Construction An order for 15 locomotives was placed with the Yorkshire Engine Company in 1907 with 10 arriving in the spring and the remainder in the autumn of that year. No. 117 was the first to arrive, this engine being the one used to familiarise footplate staff with them. Due to their size they were affectionately nicknamed \\"Tinies\\" by the footplate men. Operation The locos were set to work being able to pull 50% more than the previous capabilities of the early Stirling Classes. Though they were cleared for running on the whole of the H&B; mainline, they never strayed from Springhead Shed and were banned from the Denaby, Neptune Street, Cannon Street and Sculcoates lines. Despite being reasonable locomotives they were regarded with suspicion due to their high boiler pressures following the Wath explosion, so the H&B; management increased payment for crews who manned the \\"Tinies\\". The Wath explosion, in 1907, involved H&BR; Class F2 0-6-2T number 109. Modifications Various modifications were made to the \\"Tinies\\" over their lives. Sanding arrangements were altered to improve the adhesion of the engines, and one engine, No. 129, received a small porthole window in the cabside. All engines received a cab roof ventilator. During the First World War, the boiler pressure was dropped from 200 lb/sq.in to 175 lb/sq.in. No other modifications were made until the merger with the North Eastern Railway. LNER ownership Under new management, some \\"Tinies\\" were sent to Darlington Works where they received domed boilers. All members of the class passed into LNER ownership, though by the grouping more powerful ex Great Central Railway types were available. Cudworth shed soon became swarmed with ROD 2-8-0s, and 12 of the \\"Tinies\\" were away from their home system by 1929. Withdrawal The \\"Tinies\\" never found favour with other depot footplate staff, and all were withdrawn by the end of 1931. None are preserved.

Stjepan Iv≈°iƒá (; 13 August 1884 ‚Äì 14 January 1962) was a Croatian linguist, Slavic specialist, and accentologist. Biography After finishing primary school in Orahovica, he attended secondary school in Osijek and Po≈æega. At the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Zagreb he studied Croatian and classical philology, and later specialized at the universities in Krakow, Prague, Saint Petersburg, Moscow, and Kiev. He received his PhD in 1913 with the thesis Prilog za slavenski akcenat (A Contribution on Slavic Accent). He served as a professor at the secondary school in Gornji Grad in Zagreb from 1909 to 1915, and thenceforth as a professor of Slavic Studies at the Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb. The focal point of Iv≈°iƒá's research was Croatian ≈†tokavian subdialects, on which he published several very important studies (≈†aptinovaƒçko narjeƒçje, 1907; Dana≈°nji posavski govor, 1913). He was especially interested in the accentuation of Croatian subdialects and Old Slavic grammars. He was the first to determine the existence of the neoacute in all three Croatian dialects. In 1928 he participated in the efforts of state committee to create a common orthography for Croatian and Serbian. In the paper Jezik Hrvata kajkavaca (1936) he partitioned dialects of Kajkavian language (not including the goranski subdialects ) into four major groups. He extensively studied Croatian Glagolitic heritage, especially its special language features, on which he published several works. In 1934 he tracked the Ba≈°ka tablet from Krk to Zagreb and wrote an enthusiastic article about it called Sveta Lucija u Jurandvoru i njezin dragi kamen (Jutarnji list, 1934). In 1937 he became the vice president of the Croatian Language Society, and in 1938 the editor of the journal Hrvatski jezik (Croatian Language). He served as the chancellor of the University of Zagreb from 1939 to 1943. During the period of the Independent State of Croatia he refused an offer to serve as the head of the Croatian State Office for Language and advocated a phonology-based orthography as opposed to the official etymological-morphological one (known as korienski 'root'). Legacy In the spring of 1945, due to alleged collaboration with the enemy, he was sentenced to exile from Zagreb and lost his membership in the Academy of Sciences and Arts. He was the only one to sign the conclusion of Novi Sad agreement, with the note \\"I give this signature with the remark that the statement in Act 4 of the conclusion cannot be used for promoting Ekavian pronunciation in the present-day Ijekavian area.\\" A high school in Iv≈°iƒá's native Orahovica bears his name.Stjepan Iv≈°iƒá High School Works * Srpsko-hrvatski jezik.

Historical overlook Originally the Ministry was established as the General Secretariat of Nationalities as part of the General Secretariat of Ukraine and was headed by the federalist Serhiy Yefremov. Due to the Soviet intervention the office was reformed into a ministry on December 22, 1917. About the same time another government was formed, the Soviet, that proclaimed the Ukrainian government to be counter-revolutionary. The Ukrainian Soviet government also reorganized its office on March 1, 1918. In 1923 the office was liquidated by the government of Soviet Union and reinstated in 1944, twenty years later. The first Soviet representatives were not much of a notice until the appointment of the Bulgarian native Christian Rakovsky in 1919. General overview The ministry is located in Ukraine's capital Kyiv in the city's historic uppertown district, located in close proximity to the recently rebuilt St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery. The building of the ministry is also located on the Mykhailivska Square, named for the monastery and next to the park Volodymyrska Hill.

The section was renamed to Verwaltung f√ºr Schulung (VfS) on 25 August 1949, to Hauptverwaltung f√ºr Ausbildung (HVA) on 15 October 1949 and to Kasernierte Volkspolizei (KVP) on 1 June 1952. In addition to ground troops HVA and KVP also included a separate naval and air arm. In December 1952 KVP membership was up to 90,250. The ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Soviet military authorities exercised strict ideological control over the force. On 1 March 1956 the KVP units were transformed into the newly established army of East Germany, the NVA, and transferred to the Ministry of National Defence. Soon afterwards, the Ministry of Internal Affairs again formed its own paramilitary forcethe Volkspolizei-Bereitschaften. These were again armed as motorised infantry, with anti-tank weapons and so on, but were primarily employed on internal security and public order duties.

The surrounding area has been inhabited since the Neolithic, with the Thracians and Romans populating it in Antiquity and the Slavs and Bulgars in the Middle Ages, when it was part of the First Bulgarian Empire and Second Bulgarian Empire. The village itself, however, was first mentioned in Ottoman registers in 1430 and 1751 as Mirkuva; the name is thought to originate from the South Slavic personal name Mirko with the placename suffix -ovo. A monastical school was established in 1825, during the Bulgarian National Revival, and the locals took an active part in the Liberation of Bulgaria, participating in hajduk bands and assisting the Russian forces as opalchentsi in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78.

The Evangeline Parish unit is called Duralde Prairie and is currently being developed. It is located north of the city of Eunice. Southwest Louisiana National Wildlife Refuge Complex The refuge, along with Cameron Prairie National Wildlife Refuge, East Cove National Wildlife Refuge, Sabine National Wildlife Refuge, and the Shell Keys National Wildlife Refuge was included in the forming of Southwest Louisiana National Wildlife Refuge Complex in 2004. History The refuge was formed with purchased from The Lacassane Company. The land had previously been part of two plantations, the Illinois Plantation and the Lowery Plantation, and purchased for $51,774.00. The mineral rights were reserved but included in the consideration and were subjugated to a mineral servitude by covenant. Easement was established as well as a timeline. A 2003 Third Circuit court decision led to a 2006 decision, Waterfowl Limited Liability Company v. United States, in the United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, resulted in a reversal and the case remanded. In 1976 the United States Congress designated of the southern portion as the Lacassine Wilderness.Wilderness Connect: Lacassine Wilderness- Retrieved 2017-07-26 Wildlife and habitat Bald cypress within Lacassine National Wildlife Refuge The vegetation types occurring on the refuge are primarily water-tolerant grasses, sedges, and shrubs. Vegetation in the undeveloped marshes is dominated by bulltongue and maidencane. The habitat is divided into of natural, freshwater marsh and open water, of managed, freshwater marsh (Lacassine Pool), of rice, wheat, soybean, and natural moist soil fields, of flooded gum and cypress trees, and of restored tallgrass prairie. Most wildlife species found on the refuge are those indigenous to the marshes of coastal Louisiana. Nesting colonies of wading birds such as ibis, roseate spoonbills, and egrets, alligators, and furbearers such as mink, otter, and raccoon and nutria are found on the refuge. Threatened and endangered species that have used the refuge include bald eagles, peregrine falcons, and Louisiana black bear. Several hundred thousand ducks and geese use the refuge as wintering habitat while wood ducks, fulvous and black- bellied whistling ducks, and mottled ducks nest on the refuge during the breeding season. The refuge offers fishing, hunting, boating, wildlife observation, and hiking. Lacassine NWR, known for attracting thousands of pintails each winter (a peak of 300,000), has also seen the effects of the decreasing populations. The refuge hosted numbers well over 100,000 until the mid-1980s then saw the peaks reduced by half in the 1990s. Drought years in the mid-2000s caused a decline from 30,000 down to around 18,000. The birds are concentrated in the northwest and northeast sections of the Pool. Management Bald cypress knees in duckweed Lacassine NWR is managed intensively for waterfowl and other Louisiana coastal wetland species. The refuge has a wetland management program in which water levels are manipulated for managing naturally occurring marsh and moist soil plants and a Copeland management program where crops are planted to provide food for wintering waterfowl that migrate down the Mississippi and Central Flyways. Habitat is made more attractive to waterfowl and shorebirds by mechanical methods and flooding with costs reimbursed to the landowner or farmer. The refuge also has an active coastal prairie restoration program and a prescribed burning program. Native prairies and marshes are periodically burned on a 3-5 year rotational basis to invigorate native grasses and forbs and to set back cool season plant growth or to reduce the fuel load and organic accumulations in the marshes. Lacassine has a Wilderness Management program to help in managing the wilderness area found on the refuge and an oil and gas program to help minimize disturbance from mineral owner's activities. An alligator trapping program is used to manage the refuge's American alligator population. The refuge also has an active volunteer/intern program. Recreation Hunting and fishing are two of the most popular refuge activities. Bird watching is also very popular, with a bird list available at the refuge or online. A nature drive, foot trails, and observation towers are available year-round. An active volunteer program provides additional opportunities and students are able to earn college credits through an internship at the refuge.

Frank Cooper's is known primarily for its \\"Oxford\\" Marmalade and holds a Royal Warrant. History Oxford High Street Francis Thomas Cooper (1811‚Äì1862) was originally a hatter and hosier with a shop at 46 High Street, Oxford. He then became an agent for Ridgeway's Tea and in about 1845 converted his shop into a grocery. In 1856 F.T. Cooper paid ¬£2,350 for the remainder of a forty-year lease on Nos. 83 and 84 High Street, which were opposite his earlier premises. He ran 84 as a grocery shop and his family home. In 1867 his son, Frank Cooper (1844‚Äì1927) inherited the business and expanded the shop into No. 83 next door. (subscription required) In 1874 Frank Cooper's wife Sarah-Jane (1848‚Äì1932), made of marmalade to her own recipe. The marmalade proved popular, and until 1903 was made at 83‚Äì84 High Street.Woolley, 2010, page 91 Frank Cooper then moved production to a new purpose-built factory at 27 Park End Street. He retained the High Street premises as a shop until 1919, when he sold it to Twinings. Park End Street The Oxford jam factory The Park End Street factory was designed by Oxford architect Herbert Quinton and built by long- established local builder Thomas Henry Kingerlee. The four-storey, factory had separate floors for cutting fruit and bottling the finished product, and the third floor included a separate cloakroom and staff dining room for employees. Boiling the marmalade and jam was in a separate building at the back of the yard behind the main factory. Quinton designed the premises in compliance with the Factory and Workshop Act 1901, and the difficulty of complying with the Act at 83‚Äì84 High Street may have prompted the building of the new factory. The factory was strategically sited close to the stations and goods yards of both the London and North Western Railway at Rewley Road and the Great Western Railway in Botley Road, making the delivery of fruit and sugar, distribution of marmalade and jam and business travel for company personnel, suppliers and trade customers as efficient as possible. Success of the business led to expansion of the factory in 1912, 1915, 1924 and 1925,Woolley, 2010, page 94 using land between the 1903 building and the corner of Hollybush Row. Frank Cooper's marmalade was especially popular with dons and students in Oxford University. It was taken to Antarctica on Robert Falcon Scott's expedition to the South Pole. A jar was found buried in the ice many years after the ill- fated expedition. In Arthur Ransome's children's book Missee Lee, Miss Lee, the leader of the Chinese pirates, had been educated at Cambridge University but learned to enjoy Cooper's Oxford Marmalade. As she says 'We always eat Oxford marmalade at Cambridge. Better scholars, better professors at Cambridge but better marmalade at Oxford.' Further moves and takeover After the Second World War Frank Cooper's bought the site of the ice rink and Majestic Cinema west of the railway stations on the north side of Botley Road. A new factory was built on the site and the company moved production there from Park End Street. Brown and Polson Ltd. bought Frank Cooper's in 1964 and moved production away from Oxford in 1967, but retained the \\"Oxford\\" name for the marmalade. The current owner markets a version of Frank Cooper's Oxford Marmalade labelled ‚Ä≥Original Recipe\\" but the list of ingredients includes high fructose corn syrup. Some time between 1984 and 1987 Frank Cooper's again leased 84 and 85 High Street, running 85 as a museumhttp://www.oxfordhistory.org.uk/high/tour/south/085.html and 84 as a shop until about 1990. Since 2001, 84 High Street has been marked by an Oxfordshire Blue Plaque commemorating Sarah Cooper's inception of Oxford Marmalade. The former factory at 27 Park End Street (now part of Frideswide Square) survives and is a listed building. It is now called \\"The Jam Factory\\" and houses an arts centre, restaurant, and bar. \\"The Jam Factory\\" also houses Guardian Award-winning charity, \\"My Life My Choice\\" run by and for people with learning disabilities.

It was founded in 1918 by female graduates of the University of Toronto who wanted to continue to participate in semi-professional theatre after graduation. Originally all performers in all roles were female, but in the 1920s the society began to invite male guest performers to join the performances. Still today the leadership of the society remains entirely female. Its mission has always been to produce the great plays of the western canon, while also sometimes doing more modern works, such as the Toronto premier of one of Carol Shields' works. The society originally performed at the university's Hart House Theatre. In 1957 the society renovated an old coach house, and opened the Coach House Theatre. In 1962 the theatre moved again into a former synagogue on Cecil and Huron streets. In 1970 they were evicted from this location when the site was expropriated by Ontario Hydro. After a brief hiatus, the company found a permanent home in an old fire hall at Adelaide and Berkeley streets in 1972. Originally named Firehall No. 4, the building is one of Toronto's historic fire stations. It was first built in 1900 and was considerably renovated by architect Ron Thom, whose wife Molly was a longtime member of Alumnae Theatre. The firehall had been slated by city council for demolition, until the theatre company intervened and with the help of John Sewell convinced the city to have it saved and restored for their purposes. The building now contains a main performance space on the ground level, which seats 140. There is a smaller studio venue upstairs on the third floor.

Murh Kfarsghab is the winter dwellings of the people of the mountain village of Kfarsghab. It is a typical organization of pastoral and agricultural Mediterranean communities where seasonal fixed transhumance is still practised. Etymology Morh (, pronounced ) is derived from the Semitic root mrh. It is one form of mrah which according to Elie Wardini, > is almost exclusively in Lebanon a spread place name appellation. It > signifies stable, hurdle, resting place (for livestock), besides also > building in which the silk caterpillar is pulled (reeling of cocoons)‚Ä¶ It gives an indication as to the historical destination of this place during wintertime for the mountain people of Kfarsghab. As cattle breeding was never a main source of income for Kfarsghab, it is possible that Morh Kfarsghab was used in winter for the Mullberry silkworms which represented a major activity in the region. For the local people, Morh Kfarsghab is called sahil ( ) which literally means sea coast in Arabic. History Geography Morh Kfarsghab, the winter village, is located on the north-western slope of the Joueit valley separating Miziara from Bnachii. On average, it sits at 280 meters above sea levelgives an estimation which is slightly higher (298 meters) than measured average altitude (280 meters). A written document mentioning Morh Kfarsghab is dated to October / November 1748 AD (Thu'l-Qa'dah 1161 Hijri). Climate Morh Kfarsghab is a typical Mediterranean plain settlement. There are four seasons, with winters being mild with moderate to heavy rainfall while summers are hot, arid and dry. The highest average temperature is in August at 86 ¬∞F (30 ¬∞C) while the lowest average temperature is in January at 46 ¬∞F (8 ¬∞C). However, summer temperatures can top 104 ¬∞F (40 ¬∞C), and winter temperatures can drop below 35 ¬∞F (2 ¬∞C).On Friday, January 11, 2008, the Lebanese newspaper Daily Star, reported that temperatures in the region of Morh Kfarsghab dropped to -4 ¬∞C. Cited by Zgharta.com, Zgharta.com, last retrieved on 2 August 2008 Total yearly precipitation is in the range of 33 inches (810 mm), with the heaviest occurring from late November to early April. Rainfall is exceptional between mid June and mid September. Economy Agriculture The major issue is scarcity of water. Agricultural activities privileged crops that do not need irrigation, such as olive, grape and fig. The main culture is however olive harvested typically from November to January. In this part of the Mediterranean, a full crop of olive is only occurring every other year. There are in the village around six olive presses for olive oil extraction, most of them using the traditional first cold pressed method ensuring an excellent oil quality. Green olives and black olives are also produced as well as olive oil soap. There is also in Morh Kfarsghab an important production of grape used mainly to produce the national aniseed-flavoured distilled alcoholic drink, the Arak. Grape is harvested in July / August usually.Eat the seasons - grapes , last retrieved August 8, 2008. In the recent years, fig lost of its importance as it needs continuous care during summertime when most of the people are in the summer village, some 25 kilometers away. Finally, there is also a modest culture of almonds, citrus trees such as orange and lemon. For citrus, as it needs irrigation, it is cultivated in the valley of Joueit where water is available, at least during winters. The land owned by the Kfarsghab people extends on a large area in the Zgharta District, Bsharri District as well as Koura District.

He crashes into a barn, loses his money to a tramp, and must complete his journey riding as a stowaway on the undercarriage of a train. After the couple meet, they and the child board a train. The woman has tickets for herself and Dolly, but the man has no ticket and no money. The young woman discovers to her horror that her young charge's father is on the train. She does not want him to see her with Dolly, so she leaves the little girl with the young man and joins her employer in a separate coach. The young man is not an experienced babysitter, and caring for the child poses many challenges for him, especially as he must also evade the conductor. The story ends happily: not only does Dolly's father approve of the young woman taking the little girl with her on her vacation, the young woman also discovers that her sweetheart is the man her employer was traveling to meet, as he has recently hired him for an important position.

She was assigned to operations in the South Pacific Ocean, where, during dangerous operations at Guadalcanal, she was struck by a torpedo and beached. She was eventually salvaged sufficiently to serve as a barracks ship and as a storage ship, until she was finally disposed of post-war. Constructed in Oregon Majaba (AG 43) was built as SS Meriden by Albina Engine & Machine Works, Portland, Oregon, in 1919; acquired by the Navy under charter as SS El Capitan from her owner, E. K. Wood Lumber Co., of San Francisco, California, 23 April 1942; renamed Majaba and commissioned the same day.  World War II service  Majaba completed conversion to a miscellaneous auxiliary 14 May and subsequently steamed to the Hawaiian Islands for cargo runs to islands of Polynesia and the South Pacific Ocean. Departing Honolulu 24 June, she operated during the next several months out of Honolulu and completed supply missions to Palmyra Island, Christmas Island, and Canton Island. Thence, she reached Efate, New Hebrides, to bolster the vital ocean supply line to American forces engaged in the bitter struggle for control of Guadalcanal. Majaba departed the New Hebrides 26 October and steamed to meet two supply convoys bound for the Solomon Islands. However, heavy weather prevented the rendezvous, and she returned to Espiritu Santo 29 October. Later that day she sailed once again for Guadalcanal where she arrived 2 November. Screened by , she crossed Ironbottom Sound and unloaded cargo at Tulagi that same day. Guadalcanal operations Despite the menace of powerful Japanese naval forces, Majaba shuttled cargo between Tulagi and Guadalcanal during the next few days. She arrived off Lunga Point, Guadalcanal, early 7 November; and, while her escort, , patrolled for enemy submarines off Lunga Point, she began final unloading operations prior to her planned departure for Espiritu Santo. Shortly before 0930, lookouts in , anchored near Majaba, spotted the periscope of () followed by two torpedo wakes. One torpedo, which apparently passed under Lansdowne, hit the beach but failed to explode. The other curved toward Majaba and exploded against her starboard side amidships, destroying her engine room and boilers. She settled and listed slightly but did not sink. While Lansdowne and Woodworth searched for the enemy sub, went to Majaba's aid. The tug towed the disabled ship east along the coast of Guadalcanal and beached her that afternoon off the month of the Tenaru River.  Reclassified as IX-102  On 8 January 1943 and Bobolink freed Majaba from her beached position and towed her to Tulagi. Her engine was removed and her hull repaired and she was reclassified IX-102 and placed in an in-service status on 1 July 1943, she remained at Florida Island, Solomons, and during the remainder of World War II served as a floating quarters and material storage ship.  Post-war inactivation Following the end of the war, Majaba was towed to the Philippines. She remained at San Pedro Bay, Leyte, until early in 1946 when she was towed to Subic Bay, Luzon. There, she was placed out of service 14 March 1946 and delivered to War Shipping Administration (WSA) for return to her owner. Her name was struck from the Navy List 28 March 1946.

Its founding was the brainchild of Melvin Kranzberg, Professor of the History of Technology at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, in the United States. Kranzberg had already established the Society for the History of Technology (SHOT) and its journal, Technology and Culture, but he felt that in the midst of Cold War tensions, there was a need for another forum that focused on crossing the artificial borders of the Iron Curtain. For Kranzberg, the History of Technology, a new discipline not yet burdened with ideological or political freight as were other branches of history, was an ideal arena where scholars from East and West could find common ground. Kranzberg was supported in this effort by Maurice Daumas from France, Eugene Olszewski from Poland, and S.J. Schuchardine from the USSR, among others. For the past several decades, ICOHTEC's principal activity has been an annual meeting,http://www.icohtec.org/annual-meeting-current.html where scholars from many countries and from many disclipines gather and share their work. Papers presented at the meetings are usually published in the Committee's annual journal ICON. Kranzberg‚Äôs vision was largely fulfilled in the meetings that followed, although exchanges among scholars were not always harmonious. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the breakup of the Soviet Union in the years that followed, ICOHTEC lost its original reason for being. But it has thrived in the following years and continues to have an active international membership and hold well-attended and intellectually lively meetings. One reason is the perception that its sister society, SHOT, remains somewhat biased toward U.S. membership in spite of efforts to reach out more to an international audience.

Early years Cooley was born to William and Mary Cooley in London and began his career as a carpenter apprenticeship in 1756 with interest in architecture. Cooley worked as a draughtsman and clerk to the architect and engineer Robert Mylne (1733‚Äì1810), while the latter was building Blackfriars Bridge in London, between 1761 and 1769. In 1769, he won the competition to design a new Royal Exchange in Dublin, and the building, now the City Hall, was completed in 1779. The design shows the influence of Mylne's work, which in turn derived from French neoclassical architecture. Architecture career and Ireland Arriving in Ireland in 1768, Cooley built several public buildings in Dublin in the neoclassical style. Together with James Gandon (1743‚Äì1823), Cooley was part of a small school of architects influenced by Sir William Chambers (1723‚Äì1796).Summerson (1993), p. 412. Cooley also designed Newgate Prison (demolished 1893), the Marine School, and a chapel, all in Dublin.Richardson (2001), p. 27. In 1768 he began another public building in the city, but on his death at the age of 44 in Dublin, the project was handed over to Gandon, who completed it, to his own design, as the Four Courts. Outside Dublin, Cooley built a number of country houses including Caledon (1779), for James Alexander, later Earl of Caledon. He designed several buildings in Armagh, including the Archbishop's Palace (now the town hall), and the public library.
